## Description
This invention relates to the biotechnology of plants and more particularly to techniques for the investigation, improvement or modification of plants which entail the use of plant protoplasts. The use of isolated protoplasts for plant genetic manipulations with the vista of improved crop plants is an increasingly important aspect of plant biotechnology. Whilst the use of protoplasts is highly attractive, it is a distinct disadvantage that they have first to be isolated from plants, subjected to manipulations and then cultured to regenerate whole plants. Indeed for several crop species regenerating plants from protoplasts is still a major barrier to their use for genetic manipulations. It is the object of this invention to achieve access to plant protoplasts so that they may be utilised without complete release from the plant. According to this invention plant protoplasts are exposed for interaction with an external agent by exposing the plasma membrane of protoplasts in the root hairs of the plant without release of protoplasts from the plant. This is achieved by enzymatically degrading the plant cell wall at the apices of root hairs under conditions which expose the plasma membrane whilst maintaining or readily permitting restoration of the essential functional integrity of the plant. It has been found possible to achieve enzymatic degradation of the cell wall of the apices of root hairs from a wide range of crop species and other species and to expose the plasma membrane with partial protoplast release. Under suitable conditions root hairs are present on the roots of a wide range of plants, and the ability to remove their apical cell walls at an early stage of development enables direct interaction with plasmids, viruses and micro organisms at the surface of the plasma membrane of their exposed protoplasts, or the fusion of these with isolated protoplasts of other plant systems. Apart from these more direct consequences for plant genetic manipulations, the ability to expose the plasma membrane of root hairs of legumes will help to elucidate further the plant host factors influencing the interactions of To facilitate an understanding of the present invention the structure of a typical plant root is shown diagrammatically in Figure 1. On enlarged scale Figure 2 shows the structure of a root epidermal cell from which the root hair extends. Figure 3, on more enlarged scale, is a detail of Figure 2 showing the apex of the root hair. Figures 4 and 5 show later developments of the structure shown in Figure 2. The plant root below the line X comprises the cortex 1 containing the main root 2 and branch roots 3. Numerous root hairs 4 are shown extending from the epidermis surrounding the cortex 1 both above and below the line X. The line X notionally represents the surface of the medium on which the plant is growing. The root hairs 4 above the line X are therefore aerial hairs. The wall of the root hair 4 comprises an outermost layer 5 of cellulose microfibrils arranged at random and extending over the hemispherical tip of the root hair at 6, with the extreme tip of the hair being the site of cellulose synthesis. Below the layer 5 there is an inner layer 7 of orientated microfibrils, in which little amorphous material occurs, extending along the cylindrical part of the root hair towards the hemispherical tip 6. Thus except within the extreme tip portion 6, the randomly orientated layer of microfibrils 5 is virtually isolated from the plasma membrane 8 containing the root hair cytoplasm 9. By careful enzymatic treatment of the root hair region of the plant the random cellulosic layer 5 can be selectively removed whilst the orientated cellulosic layer 7, which is resistant to the enzyme, remains in place. It will thus be appreciated that at the apices of the root hairs the plasma membrane 8 becomes exposed, as seen in Figure 4, as a result of the specified treatment although the protoplast as a whole remains effectively intact within the root hair and in complete functional association with the plant and all biological processes occurring within it. Exposure of the plasma membrane or, in other words, exposure of the protoplast at the apices of root hairs thus provides a port of entry into plant protoplasm for any purpose in accordance with the present invention. The degree of exposure thus obtained may be sufficient for achieving access to the plant interior for the purpose of transport of any desired substance or agent across the plasma membrane. However in order to increase the interface of investigation or treatment of the plant it is preferable to arrange for an osmotic gradient between the plant protoplasm and the external environment in which the plant roots are maintained so as to cause an extrusion of the plasma membrane from the root hair apex such that the result can be described as a partial release of the protoplast. This development is shown in Figure 5. By controlling the osmotic conditions this partial release can be taken as far as possible without rupture of the membrane. The desired gradient and other conditions of this treatment can readily be determined for any species of plant by prior investigation on experimental samples of specific plant types. For example one method involves the use of aqueous solutions of the appropriate enzyme containing in addition varying concentrations of suitable carbohydrates e.g. sucrose or mannitol which are tested to determine the appropriate concentration of added substance to achieve the desired degree of release of the protoplasts. For the selective removal of the cell wall cellulose and amorphous material according to this invention many suitable enzymes are available. Cellulase activity is usually sufficient to expose the plasma membrane but pectinase activity is also helpful in achieving the desired effect. Enzymes which have been assessed separately, and in various combinations, include Worthington Cellulase Freehold, New Jersey, USA CEL, a salt free, chromatographically purified cellulase Cellulysin Calbiochem, La Jolla, California, USA Cellulase RS and Cellulase RIO Yakult Honsha Co., Nishinomiya, Japan Novozyme 234 a multi enzyme preparation with main activity towards β1 3 linkages Novo Industries, Bagsvaerd, Denmark Pectolyase Y23 Seishim Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan and Rhozyme HP150 Rohm Haas, Philadelphia, USA . The enzymes may conveniently be prepared in Murashige Skoog s culture medium with added 3 sucrose MSO Physiol. Plant A fluorescent brightening agent, e.g. Tinopal Ciba Geigy Ltd. is conveniently used for fluorescence assessments for the presence of cellulose. It may be prepared at the appropriate concentration by dilution with MSO of a saturated solution in water. Roots from seedlings of the various crop species, with associated root hairs, can be mounted on slides using cover slip risers as in the microchamber system of Jones The experimental foundation of this invention is illustrated in the following description of representative results obtained. Roots from turnip seeds germinated in MSO were incubated in 0.001 v v Tinopal in MSO for 5 minutes, washed in MSO and examined using incident U.V. illumination they were also examined by bright field illumination. A general fluorescence of cellulose microfibrils over the root hairs of turnip was evident. After placing the Tinopal treated roots in a solution of 1 w v CEL Worthington in MSO in a slide microchamber of the kind referred to above, and incubation at 20 Root hairs arise as outgrowths from epidermal cells, and those at a very early stage in their formation varying in length from slight bulges of the epidermal cells to protuberances up to approximately 50 um had their cell walls very rapidly degraded, within a few minutes, either by Enzyme Mixture A or by this enzyme mixture with the Worthington cellulase replaced by Cellulysin Enzyme Mixture B , such that the whole of the small emerging root hair became spherical. Other members of the Cruciferae, cauliflower, oil seed rape and radish have been similarly assessed for protoplast release from their seedling root hairs, and comparable results obtained. Seedlings from representative cereal species of the Gramineae, barley, maize, rice and wheat have also been investigated for the effects of these enzyme mixtures on protoplast release from their root hairs. Release from root hairs of aerial roots of rice and from barley have been demonstrated, in which there was a progressive expansion of the extruding protoplast. Comparable results were obtained for maize and wheat. In these four Graminaceous species Enzyme Mixture B was more effective than Enzyme Mixture A in releasing protoplasts from the rapidly elongating root hairs just beneath the zone of root elongation both mixtures were comparably efficacious in degrading of the cell walls of very young root hairs, Protoplast release from root hairs of representative members of the Compositae, lettuce and sunflower was readily achieved in comparable time to members of the Cruciferae using the Enzyme Mixture A. Comparable results were also obtained with this enzyme mixture using roots from seedlings of representative species of the Leguminosae, alfalfa, soybean and white clover Liliaceae, asparagus and onion Umbelliferae, carrot and Roseaceae, strawberry. A selection of Solanaceous crop species, Capsicum, potato, tomato and tobacco, including also Growth conditions were standardised to minimise variation in the osmotic pressure of the epidermal and root hair protoplast. In some instances the osmotic pressure of the medium was increased by the addition to the enzyme mixture in MSO of an extra 3 sucrose, if bursting of the protoplast at the tip of the root hair occurred with either of the standard enzyme mixtures. In all the species investigated it was important to avoid plasmolysis of the protoplast within the root hair, otherwise no release of protoplasts took place. The experimental protocol for exposing plant protoplasts in accordance with the present invention and determining appropriate conditions for utilisation of this effect are further described in the following Examples. The protocol described has been applied to seedlings of the Compositae Lettuce Preparations having the percentage compositions shown in the following Table vary in potency and range of application. The enzymes are dissolved in MSO medium containing 4 mM morpholine ethane sulphonic acid MES buffer pH 5.5 6.5. In this example the enzyme preparation used was a modification of preparation IV described in Example 2. In place of MSO the nitrogen free Fahraeus medium was used see Example 4 and mannitol was added to the preparations in concentration shown in the Table below. The root hairs of alfalfa, maize, rice and wheat respond differently to the concentration of mannitol in the enzyme The responses fall into three major zones bursting of cytoplasm B , stable subprotoplast release S and plasmolysis P . At some mannitol concentrations a few root hairs may burst and on the same root the others may form stable subprotoplasts. These mannitol concentrations form interzone B S and likewise there is an interzone S P. The root hairs of alfalfa generally form stable protoplasts in enzyme with 4 6 mannitol though there is variation between roots. The monocotyledons maize, rice and wheat form stable root hair subprotoplasts at higher mannitol concentrations above 8 and remain stable over a greater concentration range than alfalfa. The ability to expose the plasma membrane of root hairs of plants using this presently described enzymatic procedure offers many opportunities in plant biotechnology. This enzymatic procedure for the release of protoplasts enables the uptake of a range of Rhizobia may be taken up into vesicles by incubation of root hairs with exposed plasma membranes by plasmolysis and treatment with polyethylene glycol following the procedures of Davey, M.R. and Cocking, E.C., 1972 , Nature Rice seeds dehusked are surface sterilised in 30 v v Domestos solution and germinated on nitrogen free agar at 28 40 48 hour old seedlings are incubated for 5 minutes in isotonic enzyme mixture of the following composition Worthington CEL 1 g , Novozyme 2,3,4 0.5 g , Pectolyase 0.1 g , mannitol 8.0 g per 100 ml, pH 5.6 5.8, then transferred to the Exponential phase The enzyme treated roots are immersed in the polyethylene glycol with The seedlings are transferred to nitrogen free agar in square Petri dishes which can be stacked vertically for optimum seedling growth. All seedlings survive the enzyme treatment although the root growth may be impaired in some cases. Root samples are removed for light and electron microscopic examination. Efficient methods for introducing cloned genes into plants are important for their agronomic improvements, and this presently described enzymatic procedure for exposure of the plasma membrane of root hairs of whole plants enables plasmids with a range of cloned genes to be taken up into such enzymatically treated root hairs of a range of crop species. Root hairs with exposed plasma membranes may be incubated with suitable plasmids using a variety of uptake procedures including chemical stimulated uptake including the use of polyethylene glycol , delivery by encapsulation in liposomes and fusion of plasmid containing bacterial spheroplasts following the procedures described by Freeman This methodology is indicated in Example 5 below. Gene transfer by protoplast fusion is a well established procedure for the transfer of clusters of nuclear or cytoplasmic genes, and the use of protoplasts being released from root hairs now enables the basic strategy of somatic hybridisation to be applied to the intact plant. Such protoplast fusion using either chemical or electrical procedures Davey, M.R. and Kumar, A., Int. Rev. Cytol. Suppl. This technique is illustrated in Example 6 below. These procedures are generally applicable to all non legume crop species in which it is possible to achieve enzymatic degradation of the apices of root hairs. The first procedure involves fusion of protoplasts containing
