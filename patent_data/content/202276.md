## Description
Psoriasis is a disease of the epidermis and a major cause of disability and disfigurement for between 2,000,000 and 8,000,000 persons in the United States. Of these, about 100,000 are severely affected. The disease is diagnosed by the presence of scaling erythematous on the scalp and extender aspects of the arms and legs psoriatic lesions often are accentuated on the sites of repeated trauma, such as the elbows and knees. The papules or plaques of psoriasis often contain a silvery white micaceous scale that is relatively easily removed in layers. There is a several fold increase in the normal number of the basal cells of the epidermis. This increase in the basal cell population reduces the turnover time of the epidermis from the normal 27 days to 3 4 days. This shortened interval leads to the consequence that normal events of cell maturation or keratinization do not occur, and this failure of maturation is reflected by an array of abnormal morphologic and biochemical changes. Numerous cytologic, histologic, histochemical and biochemical alterations are now known to be the result, rather than the cause of the disease process. The only main fact known at this time about the fundamental cause of psoriasis is that the predisposition to its development is genetically transmitted. This introduction is basically taken from Harrison s The treatment of psoriasis still remains the province of dermatologists. The most effective treatment in the control of localized psoriasis for most patients is the topical use of corticosteroids with a plastic wrap and ultraviolet light or sunlight exposures. On certain patients who have generalized psoriasis, it has been necessary to use a variety of systemic chemotherapeutic agents, especially methotrexate the latter has the capacity to inhibit cell replication without a proportionate inhibition of cell function that is, keratinization. Photochemotherapy was introduced in 1974, in the so called PUVA treatment. In this treatment, psoralen is administered two hours before total body irradiation with a special light system that emits predominantly long wave ultraviolet light. The light alone is ineffective in producing erythema or remission of psoriatic lesions however, in the presence of one of the psoralens, the UV A light becomes a potent photoactive agent and produces a remission of psoriatic lesions after several exposures. Photochemotherapy requires specialized knowledge and lighting systems delivering precisely measured amounts of ultraviolet light. Along quite different areas of research, Holick The aforementioned seemingly two divergent lines of research, the treatment of psoriasis on the one hand, and the effects of vitamin D This invention arose out of the initial observation that when psoriatic cells were incubated An accurate correlation between an The vitamin D compounds, homologues, analogues or metabolites thereof which are useful in treating psoriasis other than hypocalcaemia induced psoriasis of von Zumbusch are those which demonstrate activity in any of the Generally, an active compound is one which induces differentiation at physiologic concentration of a tumor or a normal cell line which possess receptors for 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D A first test is one which measures the differentiation of cultured keratinocytes. The assay is essentially the one described by Hosomi, Differentiation of epidermal cells in culture is examined morphologically by Floating cells are collected from the medium. Then the cultures are washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS and attached cells are dissociated by treatment with 0.05 trypsin and 0.1 EDTA solution at 37 C for 20 30 min. Cell suspensions are then divided into two portions one for counting the numbers of squamous and basal cells and the other for counting cornified envelopes. Since basal cells are small and round, whereas squamous and enucleated cells are large and flat, they are readily distinguishable in a hemocytometer. The method of Sun and Green The size of cells can be measured in photographs with a stage micrometer as a standard. The density distribution of cells is measured by density gradient centrifugation in Percoll In the presence of an active vitamin D compound useful for psoriatic treatment, differentiation of epidermal cells is markedly stimulated. Focal stratification is formed in places on top of the epidermal cell sheets. Stratified foci increase in number and size and contiguous foci coalesce. In the uppermost layer of stratified foci, cells produce an amorphous material staining red with hemotoxaline and eothine and rhodanile blue. Some cells are enucleated and some have a thick pycnoctic nucleus. Differentiated cells slough off into the medium so that the total number of cells attached to the dish decrease continuously with the time of cultivation. The fraction of attached basal cells decrease sharply in the presence of an active vitamin D compound. For example, close to 100 of the cells are basal cells on day 0, but only about 25 on day 3 and less than 10 after day 10. In a control culture on the other hand, more than 60 of the cells are basal cells during the first six days and usually 30 40 or so remain basal on day 10. In parallel with decrease of basal cells, the number of squamous cells increases in the vitamin D active treated cultures, first among the attached cell population and then among the sloughed off floating cells. Epidermal differentiation can be quantified by counting cornified envelopes remaining after cell lysis with a solution containing 1 sodium dodecylsulfate and 1 beta mercaptoethanol. When the cells are grown in the presence of 12 nM active vitamin D compound, the percentage of cells with a cornified envelope increases with time of cultivation. The percentage is greatest after 10 days in culture when about 60 70 of the cells have an envelope. In contrast, the percentage of control cultures remain at 20 or less during a two week observation period. The cells obtained in the presence of an active vitamin D compound for 3 days are larger and lighter than those in its absence. The diameter of cells in the treated cultures is usually 25 10 mm, compared with 17 5 mm in a control. Cell density by Percoll gradient centrifugation indicates that, when grown in the presence at an active vitamin D compound for 3 days, about 65 of the cells are collected in the lightest fraction with a density of about 1.017 1.027, whereas about 40 of the control cells are recovered in this fraction. Concomitantly, the number of cells in a heavier fraction density between about 1.06 and 1.08 decrease in the treated cultures. Similar results are obtained at day 7. Human keratinocytes can be grown by the method of Clemens A second test is that of inhibition of human skin fibroblasts. This test is found in Clemens Fibroblasts are plated at 7 10 x 10 An alternative and perhaps faster and more accurate test of correlation for active vitamin D compounds is the Use of the HL 60 cells in an Any vitamin D compound which at Among the preferred compounds usable in the present invention are those of the formula I When the compounds of formula I have a double bond at position C 22, they are derivatives of vitamin D Preferred are those compounds derived from vitamins D Among other preferred compounds are water soluble derivatives of the aforementioned compounds of formula I obtained by solubilizing such compounds by attaching thereto glycosidic residues such as those disclosed in Holick, U.S. Patent 4,410,515. Alternative methods of solubilization are by conjugating compounds of formula I to glycosyl orthoester residues, as disclosed in copending U.S. S.N. 607,117 by Holick Of interest are compounds of the formula II The vitamin D compounds are prepared or obtained according to the disclosures of the aforementioned references. In particular, the 5,6 epoxy derivatives of vitamin D The fluoro derivatives are made or obtained as described in Shiina. The compounds of the invention can be administered in any appropriate pharmacological carrier for oral, parenteral, or topical administration. They can be administered by any means that effects palliating conditions of psoriasis in humans. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment and the nature of the effect desired. Systemic daily dosage of active ingredient compounds will be from 0.001 µg kg to 1.0 µg kg. Normally, from 0.1 to 1.0 µg kg per day, in one or more applications per day is effective to obtain the desired results. Topical dosage would be 0.001 µg to 100 µg cm The compounds can be employed in dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, powder packets, or liquid solutions, suspensions or elixirs for oral administration, sterile liquid for formulations such as solutions or suspensions for parenteral use. Alternatively, the compounds can be present in a pharmacologically inert topical carrier such as one comprising a gel, an ointment or a cream, including such carriers as water, glycerol, alcohol, propylene glycol, fatty alcohols, triglycerides, fatty acid esters or mineral oils. Other possible carriers are liquid petrolatum, isopropylpalmitate, polyethylene glycol ethanol 95 , polyoxyethylene monolaurate 5 in water and sodium lauryl sulfate 5 in water. Materials such as anti oxidants, humectants, viscosity stabilizers and the like may be added, if necessary. The compounds can also be administered by means of pumps or tapes. Skin biopsies from involved and uninvolved sites were obtained from psoriatic patients and therefrom were obtained cultured fibroblasts. An analysis of cultured fibroblasts from the psoriatic patients revealed that these possess high affinity low capacity receptors for 1,25 OH It was next determined if cultured fibroblasts from psoriatic patients would respond to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D
