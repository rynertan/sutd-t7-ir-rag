# Fluid regulator.

## Abstract
In a system for providing pressurized fluid, usually gas, a valve is located in the fluid line and a pressure sensing device is tapped into the line downstream from the valve to produce electrical signals which control the operation of fluid operated devices to position the valve to control the flow of fluid as it comes from the source and passes through the line. The apparatus is constructed so that when the electrical signals are turn ed off, the valve is closed to stop the flow of the pres surized fluid.
