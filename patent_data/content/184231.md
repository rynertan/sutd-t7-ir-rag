## Description
This invention relates to a geophone spring system for suspending a reference mass comprising first spring means for centering the mass both along and laterally to a main axis of the geophone, said first spring means consisting of an outer ring surrounding a middle ring and being connected thereto by legs. Geophones including such a spring system are disclosed e.g. in US A 4 285 054. Geophones are devices which sense motion by suspending an inertial reference mass structure form a rigid, fixed supporting structure. Typically, the mass is a coil form suspended by springs in a magnetic field, one spring being attached at each end of the coil from. The springs position the coil form within the magnetic field so that the coil form is centered laterally and along its axis within the magnetic field. The springs also form a suspension system having a predetermined resonant frequency. In seismic operations, seismic waves are imparted into the earth s crust at or near the earth s surface, and portions of those seismic waves are reflected or refracted from the boundaries of subsurface layers. Geophones are arranged in arrays or groups on the earth s surface, and when the reflected or refracted waves encounter a geophone, the coil form, which is suspended between the two springs, tends to stand still while the geophone housing and its connected magnetic circuit moves with the earth s surface. The movement of the coil form through a magnetic field causes a voltage to be generated at the output of the geophone. The outputs of the arrays of geophones are recorded in a form which permits analysis. Skilled interpreters can discern from the anlysis the shape of subsurface formations, and the likelihood of finding an accumulation of minerals, such as oil and gas. In present day geophones, spider springs are used extensively. Such springs are usually made from discs of spring material and have an inner ring and an outer ring which are connected by a plurality of legs. The legs are formed by etching or stamping the spring material in accordance with a predetermined pattern. Generally three such legs are used, and the three legged arrangement is generally considered the most advantageous. The legs of geophone springs generally have a rectangular cross section and are curved along their lengths between the junctures with the inner and outer rings of the spring. After etching, the spring is preformed according to known techniques. When preforming is complete, the inner ring is offset or displaced relative to the outer ring, such that when a mass is suspended between two such springs, the inner ring, legs, and outer ring of each spring lie in the same plane. A geophone is intended to sense motion from a direction which is roughly parallel to the axis of movement of the coil form with respect to the geophone housing. Therefore, it is desirable to eliminate or minimize the effects of any lateral motion of the coil form in response to forces which are not parallel to the axis of movement of the suspended coil form within the geophone. In seismic operations, an impulse which is not truly parallel with the geophone axis and which contains a frequency component at or very near to that of the spurious frequency causes the geophone to produce an undesired or false EMF in the coils. Because of its high Inasmuch as the geometry and the mass of the coil form for a given model of geophone are constant within the manufacturing limits, the spurious resonance is also constant. The frequency of the spurious resonance can therefore be raised or lowered by changing the geometry of the suspension springs. This is mentioned in Fr A 2.454.020. This characteristic has been used to raise the frequency of these false signals until they are beyond the desirable frequency spectrum of the geophone by increasing the lateral stiffness of the spring. With this approach, these false signals do not interfere with or corrupt signals of interest. A common method of increasing the lateral stiffness of the spring is to shorten the spring legs. Unfortunately, the signal distortion caused by spring nonlinearity is increased when the legs are relatively short, and spring life is reduced. It has been recently discovered that for a spring having a natural frequency of 10 hertz or less, a ratio of about 50 to 1 of the spurious resonant frequency to the natural frequency of the geophone can be achieved by straightening the legs as much as possible see applicant s EU A 85201674.0 . Such springs exhibit a clean bandwidth at frequencies higher than previously thought possible. However, the useful life of such springs is shorter than other springs which exhibit less lateral stiffness and more lateral elasticity, because the stiffness of the legs does not allow the coil form to hit its normal intended stops for violent lateral movements. Accordingly, the art has sought to extend the useful life of laterally stiff geophone springs. The art has sought an effective, simple device to give lateral elasticity to the two types of laterally stiff geophone springs those having a high natural frequency, and those having a high ratio of the spurious resonant frequency to the natural frequency. Such lateral elasticity has been deemed desirable in order to withstand rapid acceleration or deceleration as encountered in hard usage or destruction tests of a geophone. In accordance with the present invention, a geophone spring is provided having both durability and high spurious frequency. This is realized in a geophone spring system which is characterized by second spring means for centering the reference mass laterally and for providing a damped compliance laterally to said axis to prevent the first spring means from being stressed beyond its elastic limit, and which damping is sufficiently heavy to prevent the second spring means from oscillating. Thus a geophone spring system is provided which comprises two parts for different purposes for suspending a reference mass. The first part suspends the reference mass and also centers the reference mass laterally and along its axis. The second part also centers the reference mass laterally, but in addition provides a heavily damped compliance in a radial direction. This prevents the spring of the first part from being stretched beyond its elastic limits. A preferred embodiment is characterized in that the second spring means comprise an inner ring connected to the middle ring by six arms of substantially equal length. In another embodiment, the lateral compliance device may, provided it can be heavily damped, be near the outer perimeter of the spring disc. A geophone spring in accordance with the present invention, when compared with previously used springs, has the advantage of maintaining substantially linear performance even after having been subjected to the abnormally strong lateral forces experienced in rough handling or destruction tests. Furthermore, unexpected results of recent tests have shown that the invention when properly applied greatly reduces the amplitude of spurious resonance. The invention will be clarified with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring to fig. 1, there is illustrated a geophone spring 1 in accordance with the present invention. The geophone spring is made from a thin, disc shaped material such as beryllium copper. The geophone spring 1 comprises an outer ring member 2, a middle ring member 3 and an inner ring member 4. The outer ring member 2 and the middle ring member 3 are connected by a plurality of legs 5, which are formed by removing those portions of the disc designated 6. Preferably, this removal is effected by known etching techniques. Still referring to fig. 1, the geophone spring 1 includes an inner spring which is formed between the middle ring member 3 and the inner ring member 4. The middle ring member 3 and the inner ring member 4 are connected by arms 7. The arms 7 are formed by removing those concentric portions of the disc designated 8, 9 and that removal can be done by etching or stamping. The inner spring can be stamped or etched in any geophone spring, and is shown incorporated into a delta shaped geophone spring 1. As noted above, the configuration and number of the etchings to form the inner spring may be varied as desired or required. In a preferred embodiment, although the outer spring of the geophone spring 1 may be flat or preformed, the inner spring is not preformed, but remains flat. The six arms 7 are preferably substantially equal in length, and are as long as possible. The width of the arms 7 can be increased to give greater stiffness to the lateral compliance action of the inner spring, or a concentric set of arms can be added to decrease the lateral stiffness. Referring to fig. 2, a geophone has two geophone springs 1, one on the top and one on the bottom of the coil form 10. When installed in a geophone, the outer spring of each spring 1 supports approximately one half the weight of the coil form 10 and each spring 1 is substantially flat when the coil form 10 is in the rest position. As the outer spring of the spring 1 supports the coil form 10, it also centers the coil form 10 along the vertical axis of the geophone. When the geophone spring 1 is installed on the bottom of the coil form, a pressure ring 11 pushes the middle ring member 3 against the flat surface of a pole piece shoulder 12. The frictional effect of the flat surface of the middle ring member 3 being held against the flat surface of the pole piece shoulder 12 dampens any lateral resonances that could be produced during normal operation. When a second geophone spring 1 is installed on the top of the coil form, a contact ring 13 pushes the middle ring member 3 against the flat surface of a pole piece shoulder 12. The same frictional effect described above also operates with the second spring 1 on the top of the coil form. During rough handling or destruction tests, the arms 7 will flex to allow the coil form 10 to hit its lateral stops. The coil form 10 has a gap 14 on either side. To the left of the gap 14a is a pole piece 15. To the right of the gap 14b is a geophone case 16. Both the inner spring and the outer spring of the spring 1 center the coil form 10 laterally between the pole piece 15 and the case 16. The pole piece 15 and the geophone case 16 are the lateral stops which stop the lateral motion of the coil form 10. The legs 5 are too stiff by themselves to allow sufficient lateral movement and, therefore, they absorb the shock to their detriment if the lateral compliance device is not added. Since the arms 7 flex to allow the coil form 10 to hit both the pole piece 15 and the case 16, the legs 5 do not have to absorb the shocks. This extends the useful life of the legs 5, and thus of the spring 1. The foregoing description of the invention has been directed in primary part to a particular preferred embodiment. It will be apparent, however, to those skilled in this art that many modifications and changes in this specific device may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the rings 6, 7 could be in the shapes of triangles, squares, or even irregular polygons. Alternatively, the inner spring could be in a plane above or below the existing spring.
