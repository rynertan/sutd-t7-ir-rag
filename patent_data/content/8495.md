# Vehicle propulsion control systems.

## Abstract
A computer 14 carried aboard the vehicle has inputs from transducers 26,12,29,20 indicating, as well as engine speed, extent of operation of the accelerator pedal and road speed of the vehicle, the extent of operation of the brake control, and has outputs 9,31,22 connected to transducers to control throttle, gear selection and also to the braking system of the vehicle. This arrangement allows, during normal driv ing, the relief of drag when the vehicle is moving faster than the accelerator setting appears to demand by the modification of gear selection either to a very high ratio or to put the gearbox into neutral. It also, by the provision of the transducer 22 associated with the braking system, permits the modifica tion of braking effort resulting from pressure on the brake pedal to take into account a braking effort derived from the engine.

## Description
IMPR0VEMENTS IN 0R RELATING T0 VEHICLE PR0PULSI0N U C0NTR0L SYSTEMS U The present invention re1ates to vehic1e propu1sion contro1 systems and in particu1ar to systems for the automatic contro1 of the propu1sion of vehic1es driven by an engine connected through a gearbox to the driving whee1s. Propu1sion contro1 systems are we11 known in which manua1 gear changing is e1iminated by the use of an automatic gear box incorporating a hydrau1ic torque converter, in which gear ratios are se1ected by reference to the road speed of the vehic1e and the extent of depression of the acce1erator peda1, so that the effective gear ratio is 1arge1y se1ected on the basis of the 1oad on the engine. Gear boxes have a1so been proposed providing continuous1y variab1e ratios instead of discrete1y se1ectab1e ratios. Such systems are usua11y essentia11y mechanica1 in nature and on account of 1osses in the torque converter, they require an increase in fue1 consumption typica11y of the order of 5 over a norma11y driven manua11y contro11ed vehic1e. It has a1so been proposed to emp1oy an e1ectronic data processing arrangement for simi1ar contro1 purposes incorporating stored data tab1es to specify appropriate gear ratios by reference to road speed and thrott1e position factors. To faci1itate the se1ection of gear ratios in this way it is usua1 to emp1oy a so ca11ed automatic gearbox in which a number of predetermined gear ratios are provided by sun and p1anet gear configurations, the se1ection of a particu1ar one of these ratios being accomp1ished by the app1ication of a brake to the appropriate configuration, Such brakes are usua11y contro1 ed by e1ectrica11y tripped hydrau1ic se1ectors. Whereas in the case of a manua11y contro1 ed vehic1e the driver usua11y has peda1s to contro1 the thrott1e the acce1erator peda1 , the brakes and the c1utch, the systems out1ined above frequent1y require on1y two peda1s, acce1erator and brake, the c1utch being auto matica11y engaged when the acce1erator peda1 is depressed. A variety of automatic c1utches have been proposed for this purpose, some re1ying on mechanica1 princip1es and others on e1ectromagnetic phenomena for their operation. However, in the previous1y proposed systems, the app1ication of the automatic contro1 arrangement is confined to provision of means for the generation on1y of positive thrust to drive the vehic1e. Thus, braking, which arises as a consequence of the driver s demand for negative thrust, is direct1y under the contro1 of the driver and is not communicated to the contro1 system. Hence, such a contro1 system has no means for assessing the driver s desire for negative thrust and consequent1y incurs avoidab1e 1osses by app1ying engine braking when zero positive thrust is requested unaccompanied by a demand for negative thrust. Thus, there is, inherent in the contro1 systems so far reviewed, a measure of uncertainty in the contro1 input in distinguishing between the cessation of positive thrust requirements and an exp1icit demand on the part of the driver for generation of a negative thrust requirement. It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to provide an efficient cvntro1 system ab1e to distinguish between these three conditions, name1y, positive thrust, negative thrust and neither, and a so to arrange the system to generate negative, as we11 as positive thrust. According to the invention, a vehic1e propu1sion contro1 system for a vehic1e having an engine connectab1e through a gearbox to at 1east one road whee1 inc1udes means to contro1 the rate of supp1y of fue1 to the engine an acce1erator contro1 operab1e by a driver to indicate a required driving thrust a braking system having a first contro1 operab1e by the driver and a further contro1 and a computer having inputs and outputs, the inputs being connected at 1east to input transducers on the vehic1e respective1y arranged to provide current indications of engine speed, extent of operation of the first braking contro1, extent of operation of the acce1erator contro1 and road speed of the vehic1e the outputs being connected to output transducers on the vehic1e xespective1y arranged to actuate the fue1 supp1y means, to actuate means for se1ecting gear ratios, inc1uding neutra1, at the gear box and to actuate said further contro1 of the braking system to modify braking forces app1ied to whee1s of the vehic1e the computer being responsive to the indications to actuate the output transducing means. Features of drag reduction by se1ecting high gear or neutra1, and contro1 of braking effort taken separate1y represent significant advantages over previous1y known systems. An embodiment of the invention wi11 now be described, by way of examp1e, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure l shows diagrammatica11y an arrangement of transducers and a computer re1ative to a motor vehic1e, and Figure 2 is a f1ow chart i11ustrating the operation of the vehic1e under different driving conditions. Figure l is a schematic representation of a road vehic1e from which parts unnecessary to an understanding of the invention are omitted for the sake of c1arity. The vehic1e is supported on road whee1s l arranged in pairs. Typica11y one pair of whee1s l are steerab1e and are mounted on an ax1e 2, the steering mechanism not being shown in the Figure. The second pair of whee1s l are arranged to transmit drive and are associated with conventiona1 driving shafts not shown housed in a casing 3 which a1so contains a differentia1 gear not shown coup1ed to a prope11er shaft 4. The prope11er shaft 4 is coup1ed to an output end of a gearbox 5, whose input is driven through a c1utch contained within a c1utch housing 6 by an engine 7. The engine is, in this examp1e, a petro1eum fue11ed interna1 combustion engine of we11 known form and incorporates a carburetter 8 forming a fue1 regu1ating device to contro1 the admission of fue1 to the engine 7, the actua1 regu1ation of the fue1 being performed by a thrott1e va1ve not shvwn within the carburetter 8. A transducer 9 is 1inked to the thrott1e va1ve and is responsive to signa1s, Th, on a 1ine lO to contro1 its opening. In the conventiona1 engine cvntro1 arrangement, acce1erator peda1 ll is provided and is direct1y 1inked to the thrott1e va1ve. In the present examp1e, however the acce1erator peda1 ll is coup1ed to a transducer l2 which provides a signa1, A, over ,a 1ine l3 representing the extent of depression of the peda1 ll, The 1ines lO and l3 are connected to a computer l4, the 1ine l3 being an input 1ine to the computer l4 and the 1ine lO being an output 1ine therefrom. Each of the whee1s l is equipped with a brake l5, the brakes l5 being hydrau1ica11y operated by f1uid pressure transmitted over 1ines l6 from a brake cy1inder l7. The cy1inder l7 inc1udes an operating mechanism not shown coup1ed by a 1inkage l8 to a brake peda1 l9. A transducer 2O is a1so coup1ed to the brake peda1 l9 and provides a signa1, B, representative of the force app1ied to the brake peda1 l9, over a 1ine 2l to another input of computer l4, An output 1ine 23 is provided from the computer l4 to app1y a signa1, F, to a transducer 22 coup1ed to the brake cy1inder l7 to modify its operation in order to vary, to a 1imited extent, the braking force D app1ied to the whee1 brakes l5. Yet another transducer 26 is provided in association with the engine 7 to produce a signa1, E, on input 1ine 27 to the computer l4, the signa1 E representing the current speed of the engine output shaft not shown . The engine output shaft is coup1ed through the c1utch not shown enc1osed in housing 6 to the gearbox 5, which has a group of transducers 3l arranged to se1ect a particu1ar gear ratios Rl,R2..N within the gearbox 5. These transducers are connected as outputs to the computer l4 over a cab1e genera11y shown at 28. A further transducer 29 is connected to the output drive of the gearbox 5 and is arranged to provide a signa1, S, over input 1ine 3O to the computer l4, the signa1 S representing the current road speed of the vehic1e. It is to be understood that these transducers wou1d be modified in the case of a vehic1e equipped with a continuous1y variab1e ratio gear box. For the sake of the present examp1e, it is assumed that the c1utch is automatica11y engaqed as in the case of the we11 known automatic transmission arrangement, and in this case a transducer 33 provides a signa1 C over a 1ine 32 to indicate that the c1utch is engaged. It wi11 be appreciated that for other c1utch arrangements the computer wi11 be arranged to provide a c1utch energising signa1 and in this case the transducer 33 wou1d be responsive to the signa1 C on 1ine 32 to initiate engagement of the c1utch. The computer l4 is typica11y a conventiona1 microprocessor and is arranged to provide output signa1s for the energisation of the output transducers 9, 22 and 3l, the actua1 output signa1s being derived in the conventiona1 manner from driving circuits not shown which produce the necessary high current signa1s in response to the computer outputs. Figure 2 shows in the form of a f1ow chart the interactions of the various input and output connections from the computer in contro11ing the drive conditions app1ied to the vehic1e. It wi11 be seen that the f1ow chart comprises three distinct phases of operation, name1y a starting routine, enc1osed by a dashed out1ine 6O a norma1 drive routine, and a stopping routine, enc1osed by a dashed out1ine 6l. The conditions required for the starting and stopping routines 6O, 6l are c1ear1y dependent upon the precise nature of the vehicu1ar equipment, and in the fo11owing description it is assumed that an automatic transmission is provided, having a se1ector with Drive , Reverse , Neutra1 and Park positions. Interacting factors, e.g. A,B,C,D,Th,F are norma1ised to have va1ues between B 0 B and l. With the transmission se1ector positioned at Neutra1, the engine is started and the starting routine is then initiated by the driver se1ecting either the Drive or Reverse positions, the computer c1rcuits being reset at this point. It wi11 be assumed that in the present case, the se1ector is moved to the Drive position and the cyc1e is entered at box 4O in Figure 2. As indicated at box 4l, the c1utch at this point is disengaged C O and a gear ratio is se1ected in dependence upon the position of the transmission se1ector. In this case, because Drive has been chosen, the 1owest forward gear ratio is se1ected R Rl by an appropriate one of the transducers 3l. A comparison eva1uation represented by box 42 is now performed, in which the current acce1erator peda1 position A , represented by the input signa1 from the acce1erator peda1 transducer l2 Figure l , is examined. Whi1e the peda1 remains undepressed a zero condition exists in which the condition A O is true, represented by the YES 1ine 43 Figure 2 from the box 4l, with the resu1t that the computer repeated1y recyc1es the comparison operation, As soon as the acce1erator peda1 ll is depressed, the transducer l2 produces a signa1, A, and the comparison A O becomes fa1se. Thereupon the routine proceeds to a further stage, represented by box 44. In this stage, the thrott1e is initia11y set to a first function of the accelerator peda1 position Th f1 A in response to a signa1 on 1ine lO to transducer 9 and the c1utch wi11 be partia11y engaged C C , C . The routfne then pauses for a very short de1ay, after which the engagement of the c1utch is monitored as indicated by box 45, and as 1ong as it is not fu11y engaged C l then the starting routine is recyc1ed over 1ine 46. 0n each cyc1e, provided that A is not equa1 to zero A O , the c1utch engagement is advanced by a further increment, the cycles being repeated unti1 the c1utch is fu1ly engaged C l . At this point the starting routine is comp1eted, the condition of box 45 being satisfied, and the operation enters the norma1 drive routine at box 47. It wi11 be rea1ised that since the starting routine is merely to engage the c1utch to initiate movement of the vehic1e, other forms of starting routine may be emp1oyed, particu1ar1y when, for examp1e, manua1 engagement of clutch and se1ection of 1ow gear ratio is contemp1ated. The box 47 represents a thresho1d condition, in which the depression of the accelerator pedal is 1ess than a predetermined function of the road speed, AEMI f S which is required to be fu1fi11ed during driving, for the initiation of a minimum drag condition, and it is assumed at this point that it is not app1icab1e, so that the N0 1ine from this box extends the operation to box 48. Box 48 represents the norma1 driving contro1 exercised by the computer in the se1ection of gear ratio and thrott1e opening. Thus, the computer continua11y monitors the inputs A acce1erator peda1 depression , E engine speed and S road speed to se1ect a gear ratio R as a first function, f , of A and S and to contro1 the thrott1e opening Th as a second function, f , of these two factors, and this contro1 is maintained for as 1ong as the brake peda1 remains undepressed, as indicated by box 49 B 0 . As 1ong as this condition is true the operation is constant1y recyc1ed, as indicated by 1ine 5O. Whi1e the acce1erator peda1 is used to contro1 the progress of the vehic1e and remains depressed beyond the point represented in the box 47, i.e. AEMI f S to avoid the engine being used gross1y inefficient1y, then the driving routine continua11y cyc es through the boxes 47, 48 and 49. However, if, during this routine, the driver re1eases the throttle to a point where the box 47 condition becomes true a requirement exists for the vehic1e s progress to be unimpeded by a drag factor from the engine and a minimum drag option is se1ected, as represented by box 5l. In this case the gearbox is rese1ected according to its inbui1t capabi1ity either to se1ect a very high ratio with the thrott1e c1osed Th O , or to be put into neutra1 R VH or N , the choice of this gear box se1ection a1so depending, for examp1e, on such factors as a drivers prejudice, or of a 1ega1 prohibition on freewhee1ing, or coasting, despite the presupposition that efficient braking is a prerequisite to this mode of contro1. The driving routine continues to cyc1e over the 1ine 5O, however, unti1 depression of the brake peda1 renders the condition B O, of box 49, fa1se, and at this point a norma1 driving routine for braking is entered at box 52, In this routine, the thrott1e is c1osed, i.e. Th O, and this action produces a braking force F from the engine, the va1ue F being computed and the effective force being dependent upon the gear ratio which is se1ected. The ratio se1ection is made as a function of B and S to make F 1ess than B which is the pressure in the braking system resu1ting from the force exerted by the driver on the brake peda1 and becomes R f B.S so that FEMI B , and the brake system pressure resu1ting in a brake shoe force D is then made approximate1y equa1 to B F, so that the actua1 brake shoe force is approximate1y equa1 to the braking effect demanded by the brake peda1 position 1ess the braking force produced by the engine. Thus, the tota1 braking force is approximate1y the va1ue which the driver wou1d have expected from the force he app1ied to the brake peda1. It wi11 be rea1ised that this feature represents a con siderab1e technica1 advance over previous1y proposed systems and resu ts in a considerab1e increase in the efficiency of contro1 attainab1e by the use of the computer. The app1ication of braking to the driving routine is dependent upon the depression of the brake peda1 and it wi11 be rea1ised that braking may be required for two purposes , to s1ow the speed of the vehic1e temporari1y, as under norma1 driving conditions, or to stop it. The continued cyc1ing of the braking routine is therefore made dependent upon a further comparison operation, indicated by box 53. A premise is assumed that if the road speed fa11s be1ow a predetermined speed, S1, then it is the driver s intention to stop. Entry into the stopping routine is based on this premise. Thus, the actua1 road speed S is compared with the predetermined speed Sl and whi1e the road speed S is the greater, the braking routine for norma1 driving continues to be cyc1ed fvr as 1ong as the brake peda1 is depressed. At the end of a temporary s1owing operation, if the road speed has not fa11en to the predetermined speed Sl, the re1ease of the brake peda1 a11ows the norma1 drive routine to be continued at boxes 53 and 49, and over 1ine 5O. If, however, the road speed equa1s or fa11s be1ow the speed Sl, the operation continues as the stop routine 6l, entered at box 54, During this part of the operation, the braking effect is made dependent upon the driver s contro of the brake peda1. The 1owest gear ratio is se1ected R Rl , the thrott1e remains c1osed Th O and the c1utch becomes disengaged C O as the vehic1e is brought to rest. 0nce the vehic1e is stationary, the continuance of the operation wi11 depend upon whether the stop represents the end of a journey or a temporary ha1t. If the journey is at an end, then termination of operation is signified by the driver moving the transmission se1ector to the Neutra1 position, indicated at box 55. This action causes the gear ratio se1ection to be reset so that the gear box is put into neutra1 R N , as indicated at box 55, and the vperationa1 cyc1e is terminated box 57 . 0n the other hand, if the stop is mere1y temporary, it wi11 be appreciated that this condition corresponds to that obtaining at the commencement of the operation and according1y the operationa1 cyc1e is returned over 1ine 58 to the start routine at box 4l. In carrying out the operationa1 routines described above, it wi11 be appreciated that the contro1 e1ements of the computer l4 Figure l are arranged to minimise fue1 consumption and a1so to minimise brake wear so that efficient braking is avai1ab1e in case of emergency. Thus, the inputs representing engine speed and road speed together with the current thrott1e setting in re1ation to the acce1erator peda1 position a11ow the optimisation of engine operating conditions and the se1ection of a new gear ratio is then made independent1y of the consideration of whether the new ratio is or is not immediate1y adjacent to the ratio current1y in use. Hence, in the driving routine the gear ratio is changed to provide the driving thrust defined by A at the 1owest engine speed and the adjustment of Th secures the requisite fine contro1 of engine torque. Where A indicates maximum peda1 disp1acement, the ratio se1ected is that which permits the engine to de1iver fu11 avai1ab1e power at the current va1ue of S. It wi11 be rea1ised that the parameters used for programming the computer wi11 depend upon the characteristics of the vehic1e and its various components. These wi11 inc1ude, for examp1e, the avai1ab1e gear ratios, in the case of a se1ectab1e discrete ratio gear box, the power and fue1 consumption characterics of the particu1ar engine at various speeds. However, since the eva1uation of the required outputs from the computer comprise essentia11y comparison and mathematica1 operations it is c1ear that the programming of the computer is within the capabi1ities of one ski11ed in the programming art from the f1owchart i11ustrated. Thus the present invention is enab1ed to improve the efficiency of the performance of the vehic1e primari1y by the provision, in addition to the transducers used for gear se1ection and thrott1e contro1, of the additiona1 transducers 2O and 22 concerned with the provision of braking effort app1ied by the driver and the modification where appropriate of the effective pressure to be app1ied to the braking system together with the minimum drag condition during a free running driving phase when the driver s braking input is zero. It a1so fo1 ows that, during the driving routine, because the braking effect of the engine is a factor taken into account when computing the actua1 brake force D to be app1ied to the brakes themse1ves it wi11 be rea1ised that excessive braking effort is avoided, so that brake wear is minimised. It wi11 be rea1ised that the proposed arrangement requires a greater number of transducers than previous systems. However, the individua1 transducers themse1ves may be se1ected from a variety of known kinds. Where the gear box is ab1e on1y to se1ect discrete ratios, it is desirab1e to provide a somewhat greater number of such discrete ratio combinations than have previous1y been used, but it is submitted that no new princip1es of operation of the gear se1ection mechanism are invo1ved. The particu1ar form of program required for operation of the computer wi11 depend upon the particu1ar computer used, and the computer may be digita1 or ana1ogue in operating princip1e. However, as previous1y noted, it is thought that the generation of a suitab1e program to fu1fi1 the requirements set out above is readi1y accomp1ished by one ski11ed in the art of the computer chosen. In addition to the operations constituting the driving routine set out above, a further economy may be achieved, when a cruising condition at a substantia11y constant speed is detected, for examp1e by storing the current va1ue of S and comparing this va1ue with a 1ater va1ue for S under contro1 of a time de1ay circuit, the 1ater va1ue then being stored in its turn. Under such cruising conditions the thrott1e and gear ratio se1ection vutputs 9 and 3l Figure lj may be operated a1ternate1y on a mark space basis, first to run the engine at fu11 thrott1e with a high gear ratio se1ected and then to c1ose the thrott1e and se1ect neutra1. As an extension to these features, it is a1so possib1e to provide, stored within the computer, the maximum a11owab1e speeds set by 1ega1 speed 1imitations so that the driver may se1ect the appropriate 1imit, where app1icab1e, and the road speed S is then contro11ab1e by the setting of the R and Th outputs so that the se1ected 1imit is automatica11y observed. It wi11 be appreciated that it is a1so possib1e to reduce the fue1 consumption of the engine when it is being used to provide negative thrust. Thus, for examp1e, in the case of a fue1 injection system, the fue1 supp1y may be cut off. The foregoing description has not dea1t in detai1 with the se1ection of reverse gear, but it is readi1y appreciated that the se1ection of this gear requirement in the starting procedure wou1d be simi1ar to that for the se1ection of the 1owest forward qear for the engagement of the c1utch. The driving routine in this case wou1d not be required, since reversa1 is norma11y an infrequent1y required 1ow speed manoeuvre. Moreover, the description has assumed, for simp1icity of description, an automatic c1utch. However, it wi11 be rea1ised that a c1utch operated by the driver may a1ternative1y be used, a1though in this case the starting routine 6O wou1d be modified to receive information on the c1utch peda1 operation in assessing the degree of c1utch engagement. It wi11 be rea1ised that this form of operation is 1ess desirab1e than that described. A1though a rear whee1 drive petro1eum fue11ed vehic1e is i11ustrated as an examp1e, it wi11 be rea1ised that the operationa1 cyc1e described is app icab1e to any contro11ab1e speed engined vehic1e with a suitab1e variab1e gear drive connection. It is a1so to be understood that whi1e the principa1 transducers and contro1 1ines connected to the computer are i11ustrated in Figure l, the computer may a1so require the provision of additiona1 1ines for the purpose of monitoring the operation of the various components. As a typica1 examp1e, the gear box wou1d preferab1y be provided with such monitor 1ines so that, for examp1e, if the computer has required engagement of a p rticu1ar gear ratio, then the monitor 1ine associated with that ratio wou1d be scanned to make sure that the required operativn has been carried out. This permits the generation of a warning in the event of ma1function in the system.
