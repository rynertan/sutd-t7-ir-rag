# Quick release fastener.

## Abstract
A quick release fastener comprises a threaded stud 11 and a complementarily threaded receptable 1 , the stud and receptacle each having one or more longitudinally ex tending threaded and unthreaded portions 15, 8 . The or each threaded portion 15, 8 of the stud 11 and receptacle 1 respectively has a lesser angular width than the un threaded portions of the receptacle and stud respectively. The fastener has at least one stop 9 at one edge of the or one of the threaded portions 8, 15 on the stud or re ceptacle, whereby the stud can be inserted into the re ceptacle with the threaded 8, 15 and unthreaded portions of the stud 11 and receptacle 1 respectively aligned and can thereafter be rotated to engage the respective threaded portions. The stop 9 prevents over rotation of the stud 11 within the receptacle 1 thereby to define a fastened orientation of the stud within the receptacle.
