## Description
MULTI PARE SEALING SYSTEMThe present invention relates to a inulti part sealing system for hermetically occluding an opening, through which at least one pipe or cable is conducted.Such a sealing system is manufactured of a resilient material, such as rubber, and comprises a nutter of segmental parts, which jointly constitute a cylindrical body. These segmental parts, when forming the cylindrical body, abut along axial faces, each of which is provided with at least one axial and substantially semi cylindrical hole. These semi cylindrical holes, in the formed state of the aforementioned cylindrical body, constitute internal, at least substantially cylindrical, continuous holes capable of receiving the aforementioned pipe or cable.The cylindrical body, in its formed state, is provided on its outside with circumferential, virtually inflexible ribs, which are disposed in imaginary radial planes the outside diameter of these ribs is greater than the inside diameter of the opening to be occluded.Each hole formed in the cylindrical body is provided with circumferential, virtually inflexible ribs, which are disposed in imaginary radial planes the inside diameter of these ribs is at most, at least substantially, as great as the outside diameter of the pipe or cable conducted by the sealing system. With regard to a given hole formed in the cylindrical body, the aforefilen tioned external ribs and internal ribs are each disposed in pairs or sets, each of which is disposed at least in part in a common imaginary radial plane of a predebermined axial length. A sealing system of the kind described hereinabove is knawn fromUS Patent No. 4,293,138, which has the same ownership and inventorship as the present application. said device, however, relates to a cylindrical body, in which only one central hole is provided, which is arranged concentrically with the outer circumference of the cylindrical body and bere use is made of only two segmental parts.It is an object of the present invention to provide a sealing system, which, while still maintaining a cylindrical shape when the segmental parts are placed together, can acscnnodate any number of pipes or cables.The sealing system of the present invention is characterized primarily in that at least two of the internal, at least substantially cylindrical holes are arranged eccentrically with respect to the outer circmmference of the cylindrical body.Pursuant to specific embodiments of the present invention, two segmental parts can be provided, with or without a central hole. Four segmental parts can also be provided, with the cylindrical body having at least four eccentrically arranged holes, again with or without a central hole. Similarly, eight segmental parts foriing a cylindrical body having at least eight eccentrically disposed holes can also be provided.The present invention is based on the surprising finding that a qualitatively equally good hermetic occlusion of a passage is obtained by, firstly, arranging a hole eccentrically with respect to the outer circference of the cylindrical body, and, second ly, selecting more segmental parts than two for forming the cylindrical body only. The advantage of the present invention over the aforementioned state of the art is that, in hermetically occluding an opening through which more than one pipe or cable is conducted, use can be made of a cylindrical body, which ocmprises holes that are arranged eccentrically with respect to the outer circumference of the cylindrical body, so that more than one pipe or cable can be passed sealingly through one cylindrical body. In contrast, when a number of pipes or cables are to be conducted with the device of the aforementioned state of the art, an identical nLmber of cylindrical bodies will be required not only does this necessitate more extensive fitting operations, but the consumption of materials is thereby increased as well.This object, and other objects and advantages of the present invention, will appear more clearly from the following specification in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which fig. 1 is a rear view, taken in the direction of arrow I in fig. 2, of one embodiment of a sealing system according to the invention, provided with three holes for carrying three cables through an opening in a wall fig. 2 is a section along line Il Il in fig. 1 fig. 2a shows one segment of the inventive sealing system of figs. 1 and 2 prior to its insertion into the wall opening fig. 3 is a rear view, taken in the direction of arrow III in fig. 4, and also represents a sealing system for the passage of three cables through a wall, but shows the entcKiment according to the aforerentioned state of the art, drawn on the same scale as figs. 1 and 2 fig. 4 is a section along line IV IV in fig. 3 fig. 5 is a rear view, taken in the direction of arrow V in fig. 6, of another embodiment of a sealing system according to the invention, comprising four segmental parts for carrying five cables fig. 6 is a lateral view, taken in the direction of arrow VI in fig. 5 fig. 7 is a rear view, taken in the direction of arrow VII in fig. 8, of a further e icxieent of a sealing system according to the invention, carprising eight segmental parts for carrying nine cables fig. 8 is a view, taken in the direction of arrow VIII in fig. 7 fig. 9 is a rear view of an embodiment of a sealing system according to the invention, comprising two holes and fig. 10 is a rear view of an embodiment of a sealing system according to the invention, comprising four holes, no central hole being provided. Referring to the drawings in detail, figs. 1 and 2 show a wall 1, which may, for example, be a concrete wall of a basement of a building under construction, through which three electric cables 2 are conducted. The wall 1 has an opening 3, which has either been left during the pouring of concrete or drilled later in the completed wall. A sitooth liner 4, which may ccrrprise a piece of plastic pipe, is fitted in the opening 3. The three cables 2 have already been passed through the wall by the electrician. The sealing system according to the invention caiprises a cylindrical body 6, which is oatposed of two semi cy lindrical segmental parts 7 and 8.Both segmental parts 7 and 8 are provided with external ribs 9, which lie in imaginary radial planes and which, while virtually inflexible, are substantially compressible. Arranged on the flat surface of each segmental part 7 and 8 are three semi cylindrical holes 11, which are provided with internal ribs 12 disposed in imaginary radial planes these ribs, while virtually inflexible, are substantially compressible. With regard to a given hole 11, the external ribs 9 and the internal ribs 12 are disposed in pairs or sets, each of which is disposed at least partially in a corimon imaginary radial plane having a predetermined axial length.The procedure of the invention, as specified hereinbove, is implemented as follows. The liner 4 has previously been fixed in the opening 3, for example by the builder s workers, whereupon the electrician has passed the cables through the opening The segmental parts 7 and 8 are now fitted about the three cables 2, in conformity with the situation indicated in fig. 2a. The segmental halves, now jointly constituting a cylindrical body, are subsequently pushed into the liner 4, and, if necessary, pressed in with the use of a mallet. This pressing operation is continued until the flange 14 is in contact with the head of the liner 4.As fig. 2 indicates, the ribs 9 are now compressed. As a result, internal oompressive forces set up in the material of the cylindrical body these forces are transmitted to the ribs 12 and to the axial contact surfaces 15 for sealing the segmental halves 7 and 8. This causes the ribs 12 to be sealingly lightened about the cables 2 and the contact surfaces 15 to sealingly contact one another. It should be noted that, as a result of the contact of the flanges 14 of the segments 7 and 8 with the head of the liner 4, the segments 7 and 8, and hence their external and internal ribs 9 and 12 respectively, will be properly aligned with one another. Figs. 3 and 4 likewise show a sealing system for the passage of three cables similar to the cables 2 in figs. 1 and 2.ever, figs. 3 and 4 are a representation of a sealing system according to the aforementioned state of the art, on the same scale as figs. 1 and 2. In these figs. 3 and 4, use is made, according to the aforementioned state of the art, of three cylindrical bodies 106, so that a separate cylindrical body is used for each of the cables 102. For this purpose, a cylindrical block 104 with three bores 105 is inserted in the opening 103 in the wall 101. The sealing mechanic now introduces the three cylindrical bodies 106 into each of the bores 105, through which the electrician has already passed a cable 102, for which operation reference is made to the procedure described hereinabove. With the use of the method of sealing according to the aforementioned state of the art, evidently a considerably larger amount of material and cost of fitting will be required than is the case, when adopting the sealing method according to the invention, as explained with reference to figs. 1 and 2. Furthermore, the heretofore known sealing system requires more space for two or more cables, so that a much larger opening is required in the wall. Figs. 5 and 6 represent a four part segmented cylindrical sealing body 20 according to the invention, serving a fivefold passage.Figs. 7 and 8 represent an eight part segmented cylindrical body 30, which serves for a ninefold passage.Figs. 9 and 10 respectively represent rear views of a two part segmented cylindrical body 40 with two holes, and a four part segmented cylindrical body 50 with four holes, no central hole being provided.
