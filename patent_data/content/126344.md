## Description
Background Of The Invention This invention relates to certain tripeptide esters of therapeutic agents, to pharmaceutical compositions containing tripeptide esters of therapeutic agents and to the therapeutic uses of such esters. Many therapeutic agents exhibit physical properties upon in vivo administration which detract from their overall desireability. As one illustrative example, the macrolide antibiotics have been found to exhibit highly effective antibacterial action against such organisms as Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum,Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Entamoeba histolytica, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bordetella pertussis. These compounds are therefore highly useful, inter alia in the treatment of susceptible upper and lower respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue infections.Despite their high level of utility as antibiotic therapeutic agents, the macrolides have been known in some cases to exhibit irregular oral bioavailability, undesireable gastrointestinal side effects, such as abdominal cramping and discomfort, and moderate to severe pain upon injection. Thus, the search continues for modified therapeutic agents, such as modified macrolide antibiotics and others, which exhibit the desired therapeutic effects of the parent therapeutic agent while reducing or eliminating undesireable physical characteristics or side effects of the therapeutic agent upon in vivo administration. It has now been found that certain tripeptidyl esters of therapeutic agents are capable of being converted to the parent therapeutic agent in the presence of aminopeptidase, such as upon in vivo administration to an aminopeptidase containing subject.Detailed Description Of The Invention The compounds of the present invention are tripeptide esters of therapeutic agents, which may be represented by the formula D P I.wherein D is the residue of a hydroxyl containing therapeutic agent and P is an N terminal tripeptidyl moiety having the amino acid residue sequence AAlAA2AA3 wherein AA1 is a secondary amino acid residue, AA2 is a primary amino acid residue and AA3 is anN terminus amino acid residue capable of acting as an aminopeptidase substrate, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used herein, the term secondary amino acid residue means the residue of an amino acid having a secondary a amino group. Examples of naturally occurring secondary amino acid residues useful in the practice of the invention include t prolyl, L 4 hydroxyprolyl and sarcosyl. Other useful secondary amino acid residues may be formed by substitution of a primary a amino acid, e.g., by N alkylation to form an amino group of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R is an alkyl group having from l to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, such asL N methylalanyl, L N methylhistidyl, L N ethylglycyl,L N ethylalanyl, L N ethylhistidyl, or the like. The term primary amino acid residue means the residue of an amino acid having a primary a amino group. Examples of useful primary amino acid residues include glycyl, L alanyl, 2 aminoisobutyric acid,L histidyl, L asparaginyl, L cysteinyl, L cystinyl, L 3,5 dibromotyrosyl, L 3,5 diiodotyrosyl, L isoleucyl,L leucyl, L lysyl, L methionyl, L phenylalanyl, L seryl,L threonyl, L thyroxyl, L tryptophyl, L tyrosyl,L valyl, and the like. Suitable N terminus amino acid residues capable of acting as an aminopeptidase substrate can be any amino acid residue which is subject to cleavage from the tripeptidyl moiety due to the action of aminopeptidase enzymes. Aminopeptidase enzymes, such as leucine aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase A and the like, occur widely in nature and are commonly found in the blood serum and tissues of all mammalian species.Examples of N terminus amino acid residues suitable for use in connection with the practice of the invention include L leucyl, L phenylalanyl, L valyl, L alanyl,L lysyl, glycyl, L seryl, L aspartyl, L glutaminyl,L asparaginyl, L arginyl and the like. Therapeutic agents useful in the compounds of the invention can be any therapeutically useful, hydroxyl containing moieties capable of being esterified with an N terminal tripeptide of the invention. or purposes of illustration, the therapeutic agents will hereinafter be exemplified by the erythromycin moiety, although it is contemplated that other therapeutic agent moieties will be equally useful in the practice of the inventive concepts.For example, tripeptide esters of the invention may be formed with other illustrative therapeutic agent moieties such as other hydroxyl containing macrolide antibiotics, e.g., leucomycins A1 and A3, and the like aminoglycoside antibiotics, e.g., gentamicin, fortimicin A, 3 o dimethylfortimicin A, sagamicin and the like steroids, e.g., aldosterone, hydrocortisone and the liken cardiovascular agents, e.g., phentolamine, propanolol and the like cytotoxic agents and many others. As can be seen by the foregoing, it is contemplated that the tripeptidyl esters of the invention are widely applicable to hydroxyl containing therapeutic agents in general.When the compounds of the invention are tripeptidyl esters of erythromycin compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, the compounds may be used in the treatment of an infection caused by a susceptible organism by administering to an aminopeptidase containing subject an antibacterially effective amount of said compounds.When the compounds of the invention are tripeptidyl esters of other therapeutic agents, the compounds may be used in the presence of aminopeptidase to obtain the normal purpose of such other therapeutic agents. The term wpharmaceutically acceptable salts , as used herein, refers to the nontoxic acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of formula I, or by separately reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid. Representative salts include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, bisulfate, acetate, oxalate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, borate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tart rate, napsylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, lauryl sulfate and the like. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, depending upon the number of available amino groups for salt formation, the salts of this invention can be per N salts. It has been found that in the presence of aminopeptidase, the presently preferred tripeptide esters of the invention release the free therapeutic agent. The compounds of the invention are therefore useful as prodrugs which exhibit the activity of the therapeutic agent when administered to an aminopeptidase containing subject. While the precise mechanism of therapeutic agent release has not been fully demonstrated, it is presently believed that dipeptide esters of the formula D AA1 AA2 wherein D is the residue of a hydroxyl containing therapeutic agent moiety, AA1 is a secondary amino acid residue and AA2 is a primary amino acid residue, spontaneously fragment in aqueous solution or biological fluids to yield the parent therapeutic agent and a diketopiperazine.However, when the terminal amino group of the dipeptidyl ester is blocked by a third amino acid residue, no such fragmentation can spontaneously occur and the tripeptitidyl ester remains stable in aqueous solution or non aminopeptidasecontaining biological fluids. When the terminal amino acid residue AA3 is removed from the tripeptidyl ester through aminopeptidase activity, the secondary amino acid residue AA1 and the primary amino acid residue AA2 spontaneously fragment in aqueous solution or biological fluids to release the parent therapeutic agent. The compounds of the invention may be formed by reacting the acid chloride of a N protected secondary amino acid with a hydroxyl containing therapeutic agent to obtain the corresponding N protected monopeptidyl ester. Conventional amine protecting groups, such as the carbobenzyloxy group CBZ or other amine protecting groups which are well known in the art, may be employed for this purpose. The monopeptidyl ester is then hydrogenated to remove the amine protecting group and reacted with a suitable N protected dipeptide in the presence of a coupling agent, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, to obtain the corresponding N protected tripeptidyl ester. Upon removal of the protecting group, the desired tripeptidyl ester is obtained. When the therapeutic agent residue is derived from a compound having more than one hydroxyl group, such as the antibiotic compound erythromycin A, a tripeptidyl ester of the invention may be formed at more than one position in the therapeutic agent molecule.Thus, erythromycin A based compounds of the invention include the 2 tripeptide esters, 4w tripeptide esters, ll tripeptide esters, 2 ,4 bis tripeptide esters, 4 ,11 bis tripeptide esters and 2 ,4 ,11 tris tripep tide esters of erythromycin A. These compounds can be represented by the formulaeEMI6.1 wherein at least one of Rl or R2 in formula II andR3 in formula III is an N terminal tripeptidyl moiety having the amino acid residue sequence AA1 AA2 AA3 wherein AA1 is a secondary amino acid residue, AA2 is a primary amino acid residue, and AA3 is anN terminus amino acid residue capable of acting as an aminopeptidase substrate, and the remaining of R1 orR2 is hydrogen.The tripeptiyl esters of the invention further include mono or di tripeptidyl esters of the known 2 esters of erythromicin A having therapeutic activity, such as erythromycin 2 propanoate erythromycin estolate , erythromycin 2 ethylsuccinate and the like.

Example 26 In Vitro Activity The in vitro rate of hydrolysis of tripeptide esters of erythromycin A in the presence and in the absence of aminopeptidase was determined as follows. A 50 ul sample of a 20 mg. ml. solution of a test tripeptide ester compound in methanol was added to 0.4 ml. of an aqueous solution of 50 mM Tris hydrochloride and 5 mM MAC12 at a pH of 8.0, to obtain a final concentration of the test compound of 2 mg. ml. The solution was heated to 37 C in a water bath. To the test solution was added 100 p1 of a 1 mg. ml. solution of soluble kidney leucine aminopeptidase, and the progress of hydrolysis of the compound to Erythromycin A was monitored by thin layer chromatography. In the foregoing manner, the hydrolysis rate of the following test compound was determined as shown inTable I. Example 27 In Vivo Activity Eight groups of ten female CF 1 mice, each weighing 18 20 g. were supplied with food and water ad lib and injected intraperitoneally with a lethal dose 100 x LD50 of Staph. aureus, strain 642a. At 1 and 5 hours after intraperitoneal infection, the mice were administered by intraperitoneal injection equal doses of either erythromycin A At or 4 L leu gly L pro erythromycin A B dissolved in a phosphate buffered saline solution.The number of mice surviving in each group 5 days after infection is shown in the followingTable II Table II Test Total Mice Compound Dose mg kg Surviving A 30 10 A 7.5 10 A 1.9 9 A 0.4 9 B 41.1 10 B 10.5 10 B 2.6 10 B 0.6 5 From the foregoing, the effective dose ED50 for intraperitoneal injection of erythromycin A was determined to be less than 0.4 mg. kg. and that for 4 L leu gly L pro erythromycin A was determined to be 0.6 mg. kg. These doseages are essentially equivalent when the increased molecular weight of the tripeptide ester is taken into consideration. Example 28 In Vivo Activity The procedure of Example 25 was repeated except that the erythromycin A and 4 L leu gly L proerythromycin A were administered subcutaneously instead of intraperitoneally. The number of mice surviving in each group five days after infection is shown in the following Table III Table III Test Total Mice Compound Dose mg kg Surviving A 30 10 5 A 7.5 10 A 1.9 1 A 0.4 1 B 41.1 10 B 10.5 6 B 2.6 5 B 0.6 2 From the foregoing, the effective dose ED50 for subcutaneous administration of erythromycin A was determined to be 2.8 mg. kg., and that for 4t L leu gly L pro erythromycin A was determined to be 3.1 mg. kg. Example 29 In Vivo Activity The procedure of Example 25 was repeated except that the erythromycin A and 4 L leu gly L oro erythromycin A were administered orally, and that 0.5 ml of homogenized milk was administered orally to each mouse prior to administration of the test compound to minimize acid degredation of the test compound.

Example 30 Gastrointestinal Motility Female beagle dogs having a weight of 7.0 to 11.0 kg. were anesthetized with pentobarbital and maintained in surgical anesthesia by supplemental I.V. injections of pentobarbital as needed. The body temperature of each dog was maintained at 36 370 C. The trachea was cannulated and the animal maintained on a respirator at 12 strokes minute with a volume of 200 ml. stroke. The femoral artery was cannulated for blood pressure recording and both femoral veins were cannulated for intravenous injections and blood collection. Each dog was then prepared for gastrointestinal motility determinations as follows. The abdomen was opened with a midline incision and strain gauge transducers, previously calibrated to 40 g.full scale, were sewn on at the following locations 1. the stomach, 2 3 cm. orad from the pylorus 2. the duodenum, 2 3 cm. caudad to the pylorus 3. the jejunum, 10 cm. from the ligament of Treitz 4. the ileum, 10 cm. orad from the ileocecal valve and on the transverse colon and 5. the colon, 10 cm. distal to the cecum.The abdominal cavity was packed loosely with sponges and kept moist with saline. After an equilibration period of 15 minutes, a dose of 50 vg .kg. of methacholine was administered intravenously to the dog over a period of thirty seconds and the strain gauge readings were monitored to obtain a standard measurement of reactivity of the gastrointestinal tract. The dog was then injected intravenously with 1.0 mg. kg. of either erythromycin A lactobionate or 4w L leu gly L pro erythromycin A in a saline or saline alcohol solution, respectively, over a ten second period, followed by 1.0 ml. of saline wash. The strain gauge readings were again monitored to determine effect of the test compound on motility of the gastrointestinal tissue. Administration of erythromycin A lactobionate resulted in pronounced stimulation of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum and ileum, with no apparent effect on the colon. Administration of 4 L leu gly L pro erythromycin A resulted in no apparent stimuation of the gastrointestinal tissues.The contractile or motility index was determined according to the method of Jacoby, et al., as described in WGastrointestinal Actions of Metoclopramidew, Gastroenterology, Vol. 52, No. 4 1967 , pp. 676 684 by giving a numerical score to the height of each recorded contraction in the five minute period both before and after administration of the test compound.The contractile index for the test compounds erythromycin A lactobionate and 4w L leu gly L pro erythromycin A is shown in the following Table V Table V Contractile Index 4 L leu Erythromycin gly L pro Tissue Lactobionate erythromycin A Stomach 56.0 1.25 Duodenum 30.0 2.5 Jejunum 26.0 0.0 Ileum 13.0 1.0 Colon 0.0 0.0 The tripeptide esters of the invention may be administered orally or by parenteral injection, e.g., by intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous routes of administration. In addition to the active compounds, compositions according to this invention for parenteral injection may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions. Examples of suitable nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such compositions may also contain ajuvants such as preserving, wetting emulsifying, and dispersing agents.They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules.In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include ad juvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents. Compositions for rectal administration are prefereably suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as cocoa butter or a suppository wax. Actual dosage levels of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of active ingredient effective to achieve a desired therapeutic effect for a particular composition and method of administration. The selected dosage level therefore depends upon the nature of the therapeutic agent moiety, the desired therapeutic effect, the route of administration, the duration of treatment and other factors. Generally, when the therapeutic agent moiety is derived from erythromycin A, dosage levels of about 0.1 to about 1000, more preferably about 0.25 to about 750 and most preferably about 0.5 to about 500 mg. of active ingredient per kg. of body weight are administered daily to a mammalian patient suffering from an infection caused by a susceptible organism. If desired, the daily dose may be divided into multiple doses for administration, e.g., two to four times per day.
