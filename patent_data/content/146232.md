# Resistor materials.

## Abstract
A resistor material is provided which is substantially a mixture of silicon nitride and metal tungsten or molybdenum and or metal silicide particles dispersed in the nitride. A thin film resistor is formed of a layer of such material provided on a substrate. Such resistor material, or such a resistor, of such a structure is provided for example by reactive sputtering, in a nitrogen containing atmosphere, in which silicon and metal are co sput tered by ion bombardment of a suitable target or targets.
