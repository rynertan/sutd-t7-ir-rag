# FLEXIBLE POLYURETHANE FOAM COMPOSITIONS, AN MDI PREPOLYMER FOR PREPARING SUCH COMPOSITIONS, AND METHODS OF PREPARING SUCH COMPOSITIONS AND PREPOLYMER

## Abstract
A flexible polyurethane foam composition characterized by high tensile or tear strength is prepared by reacting an MDI prepolymer, prepared by reacting an MDI having a low functionality with an ethylene oxide capped polypropylene glycol polyol, with a small amount of a tetraethylene glycol as a cross linking agent and an ethylene oxide capped polypropylene glycol polyol. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a blowing amount of a blowing agent, such as water and or a halocarbon, and a catalytic amount of a polyurethane catalyst, which may be a combination of an amine and tetravalent tin catalyst. The addition of a small amount of a chlorinated phosphate flame retardant agent mixed with the reactants provides for a polyurethane foam composition of good fire retardancy and which when exposed to open flame does not melt, but chars. Further, the addition of a trimerization catalyst to the reactants provides a foam composition with reduced shrinkage.
