# Method for adjusting heart pacer rate relative to right ventricular systolic pressure to obtain a required cardiac output.

## Abstract
The apparatus for pacing a heart in accordance with the heart rate needed to produce a required cardiac output while the person is exercising, comprises a pacer 12 adapted to be implanted in a human body and having a pulse generator and control circuitry e.g. including a microprocessor there in, a pacing lead 14 adapted to be implanted in a heart 18 and having a distal electrode 20 adapted to engage and supply pacing pulse to a right ventricle 16 of a heart 18 , and pacer sensor 24 for sensing right ventricular systolic pressure mounted on the lead 14 . An algorithm and routine utilizing same are stored in the control circuitry microp rocessor and are adapted to relate right ventricular systollic pressure and or the time derivative of the pressure sensed with the required heart rate needed to supply a desired cardiac output and to cause the pacer to pace the heart at the required heart rate when the heart is not naturally paced.
