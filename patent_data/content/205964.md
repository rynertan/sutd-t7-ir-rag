## Description
The present invention describes a method for continuously producing a silicone polymer filler mixture in a continuous kneader extruder. Silicone polymer filler mixtures are used as a base for various silicone rubber compositions, silicone compounds and greases, etc. These mixtures are generally produced by first polymerizing silicone oligomer into a silicone polymer with the desired viscosity and then mechanically mixing the resulting silicone polymer with the selected filler. However, such methods require 2 different types of processes, necessitating a separate polymerization apparatus and mixing apparatus. As a result, the process is complicated and disadvantageous on a cost basis. In addition, it is difficult in such methods to mix and disperse filler into high viscosity silicone polymers and large amounts of energy are consumed. This particular problem becomes significant when the molecular weight of the silicone polymer is as high as that of a so called gum. On the other hand, British Patent 1,325,654 published August 8, 1973, discloses a method in which a silicone polymer filler mixture is produced by polymerization of organosiloxane oligomer in the presence of filler. However, this method is a batch process and suffers from the following problems production of silicone polymer with the desired degree of polymerization requires a long time, the process is complicated and heterogeneous gel material is produced in the silicone polymer filler mixture product. United States Patent Number 4,433,096, issued February 21, 1984 to Bokerman, et al. teaches a method of polymerizing polydiorganosiloxane in the presence of filler, using basic diorganosilanolates as catalysts. The use of trifluoromethane sulfonic acid is taught in United States Patent Number 4,448,927, issued May 15, 1984, to Falender, et al. The use of a catalytic amount of sulfuric or sulfonic acid is described in United States Patent Number 4,482,670, issued November 13, 1984 to Saam, et al. A mixture of quaternary ammonium carboxylate and carboxylic acid is disclosed in United States Patent Number 4,486,567, issued December 4, 1984 to Bowman, et al. None of these methods disclose a continuous method of producing a silicone polymer filler mixture, but describe batch methods of production. United States Patent 3,839,388 discloses a continuous process for the condensation and or equilibration of organosilicon compounds, containing an oxygen atom. It is essential in this process to use a phosphonitrilic chloride solution which is obtained from the reaction of two moles of phosphorous pentachloride and one mole of ammonium chloride. This process is only employed for organosilicon compounds or admixtures of organosilicon compounds with other silicon compounds. DE AS 1,719,321 is concerned with a method and an apparatus for the preparation of various silicon products. The apparatus is characterized by a pair of screw extruders in series. The present invention produces a silicone polymer filler mixture by passing a mixture of silicone oligomer, filler, and polymerization catalyst through a continuous kneader extruder to polymerize the oligomer. The object of the present invention is to eliminate the above mentioned problems in prior methods for producing silicone polymer filler mixtures by providing a method for producing a homogeneous silicone polymer filler mixture using a very simple, rapid process with low energy consumption. The object of this invention is achieved by a method for producing a silicone polymer filler mixture, characterized in that a silicone polymer filler mixture is produced by passing By way of explanation, the silicone oligomer comprising component A is the starting material for the silicone polymer. This silicone oligomer consists of only a polydiorganosiloxane with the general formula or of a mixture of polydiorganosiloxanes a and b . In the preceding general formulas, each R is independently an unsubstituted or substituted monovalent hydrocarbon group. The unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon groups are exemplified by alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl aryl groups such as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl and ethylphenyl and alkenyl groups such as vinyl, allyl and 1 propenyl. The substituted monovalent hydrocarbon groups are exemplified by substituted alkyl groups such as chloromethyl, iodomethyl, bromomethyl, fluoromethyl, 2 chloroethyl, 2 iodoethyl, 2 bromoethyl, 2 fluoroethyl, 3 chloropropyl, 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl, chloroisobutyl, 2 phenylpropyl, 2 phenylethyl, 3 mercaptopropyl, mercaptoisobutyl and 2 cyanoethyl. It is preferred that all R groups in the formulas for polydiorganosiloxanes a and b be methyl otherwise, one R in each siloxane unit is methyl and the other R is a monovalent hydrocarbon group other than methyl. The average value for The silicone oligomer used in the present invention optionally additionally contains polydiorganosiloxane c with the general formula The quantity of addition of components c and d is determined from the average molecular weight desired for the silicone polymer in the final silicone polymer filler mixture. The molecular weight of the silicone polymer in the final product declines with an increasing concentration of components c and d in the starting material. The optimal quantity of components c and d is most advantageously determined by experiments in order to accomplish the desired results however, this quantity is generally small, for example, 5 weight parts per 100 weight parts of the combined quantity of components a and b . The filler comprising component B , depending on the type, plays the role of thickener, reinforcer, extender or agent for imparting conductivity, etc. The filler may be a reinforcing filler such as fumed silica, precipitated silica, fumed titanium dioxide or carbon black or an extending filler such as quartz powder, aluminum oxide, zirconium silicate, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, talc, diatomaceous earth, iron oxide, calcium carbonate, clay, titanium dioxide, mica, glass powder or graphite. The quantity of filler used depends on the type of filler and on the application of the silicone polymer filler mixture. A strongly reinforcing filler such as fumed silica or precipitated silica will generally be employed at from 2 to 70 weight parts per 100 weight parts total polydiorganosiloxane. The highest reinforcing performance is obtained for this range of addition. Other fillers are used at from 1 to 150 weight parts per 100 weight parts total polydiorganosiloxane, but the optimal quantity is appropriately determined by experiment. The filler may be a single filler or 2 or more fillers may be used simultaneously. Water present in the filler and silicone oligomer functions as an end stopping agent for the silicone polymer and so must be carefully regulated. The catalyst comprising component C is unrestricted as long as it can polymerize the polydiorganosiloxane oligomer in the presence of inorganic filler. When the inorganic filler used is an acid filler a weight percent slurry in distilled water has a pH 7 or a neutral filler pH is approximately 7 , the use of an acid catalyst is preferred. Examples of said acid catalysts are sulfuric acid, sulfonic acids with the formula XSO₃H where X is selected from halogen, alkyl, aryl, alkoxy and alkaryl groups , perfluorinated alkanesulfonic acids, phosphoric acid, activated clay, and combinations of carboxylic acids and quaternary ammonium carboxylates. Examples of acid and neutral fillers are carbon black, fumed silica, precipitated silica, diatomaceous earth, quartz powder, fumed titanium dioxide and glass powder. When the filler is basic, the catalyst should be a basic catalyst. Examples of said basic catalysts are sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium dimethylsilanol and tetrabutylsulfonium dimethylsilanol. Examples of basic fillers are calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide and calcium silicate. The quantity of catalyst used is unrestricted as long as it is sufficient to polymerize the polydiorganosiloxane oligomer to give the desired degree of polymerization, but this quantity should be as small as possible from the standpoints of economics and the stability of the silicone polymer filler mixture. The preferred quantity of catalyst is 0.02 to 10 weight parts and preferably 0.02 to 5 weight parts per 100 weight parts total polydiorganosiloxane. The use of a continuous kneader extruder is the most important element in the present invention and is an essential factor. It is the use of such a device which, for the first time, eliminates the problems residing in the prior art technologies as discussed above. The continuous kneader extruder used in the present invention provides for a continuous kneading and extrusion by using a kneading element equipped screw, and is selected from among single screw and multi screw extruders such a Ko Kneaders. Multi screw extruders are preferred with twin screw extruders most preferred. In these twin screw extruders, two co rotating or counter rotating screws are installed parallel to each other in the barrel and a feed opening or openings for polydiorganosiloxane oligomer, filler and catalyst are installed at the head of the rear zone when considered longitudinally. Three feed openings may be present for the separate supply of polydiorganosiloxane oligomer, filler and catalyst alternatively, 1 or 2 feed openings may be installed for joint use. As necessary, 1 or more vents are installed in the kneading zone subsequent to the above mentioned feed opening s . The two screws may be single flight, double flight or triple flight screws and they may be intermeshing or non intermeshing. The instant continuous kneader extruder advantageously has a heating means in the downstream half when considered longitudinally. As desired, 2 or more continuous kneader extruders may be connected in series in the present invention. In this case, the machines connected to each other may be the same or of a different type. Silicone oligomer, filler and catalyst, supplied into the barrel from the feed opening or openings, are mixed by the rotation effect of the rotating screw or screws while being transferred in the direction of the discharge outlet. At the same time, the silicone oligomer is catalytically polymerized to a higher molecular weight. The polymerization of the silicone oligomer proceeds rapidly in the heated zone. The barrel temperature and residence time in the barrel are both the minimum values which give the desired degree of polymerization in the silicone polymer in order to achieve advantageous economics. The downstream half considered longitudinally of the continuous kneader extruder should be maintained at from 50 to 200 C and the residence time in the barrel should be regulated at from 1 minute to 1 hour. The rate of screw rotation will depend on the type of continuous kneader extruder used, but it should be high in order to achieve an excellent filler dispersion and to prevent the production of heterogeneous gel. The rate of screw rotation is generally 10 to 500 rpm and preferably 100 to 400 rpm. The silicone polymer filler mixture produced by the above described method is useful as a base for silicone rubber compositions, silicone compounds and silicone greases. To produce a milling type silicone rubber composition, organoperoxide is added to a mixture of silicone polymer gum and reinforcing filler, with mixing to homogeneity. Appropriate organoperoxides are known and examples thereof are benzoyl peroxide, 2,4 dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, di t butyl peroxide, 2,5 bis t butylperoxy 2,5 dimethylhexane, dicumyl peroxide, t butyl perbenzoate and p chlorobenzoyl peroxide. When the silicone polymer filler mixture is to be used for a condensation curing organopolysiloxane composition, crosslinker and possibly curing catalyst are added and mixed into a mixture of filler and hydroxyl terminated polydiorganosiloxane as the silicone polymer. The filler is a reinforcing filler, extender filler or mixture of such fillers. The crosslinker is a trifunctional silane, tetrafunctional silane or polyfunctional polysiloxane oligomer. Typical examples of the silicon bonded functional groups are the acetoxy, alkoxy, diorganoamino, ketooxime and acylamino groups. Examples of the optional curing catalysts are metal carboxylates, alkylmetal carboxylates, alkylmetal alkoxides and organotitanates. Among these catalysts, stannous octanoate, dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin dilaurate, tetrabutyl titanate, dibutyltin dimethoxide and tetraisopropyl titanate are preferred. When the silicone polymer filler mixture is to be used in an addition curing silicone rubber composition, a mixture of filler and straight chain silicone polymer containing at least 2 monovalent unsaturated aliphatic groups for example, vinyl and allyl in each molecule is combined and mixed with a polyorganohydrogensiloxane containing in excess of 2 silicon bonded hydrogen atoms per molecule, and with a very small amount of a platinum containing catalyst. Small amounts of additives may be added to the silicone polymer filler mixture in order to improve the thermal stability, workability, storage stability, compression set, oil resistance or flame retardancy or in order to color the mixture. The present invention will be explained using examples of execution, but is not limited to the examples. Parts in the examples is weight parts and the viscosity is measured at 25 C. The molecular weight of the silicone polymer in the produced silicone polymer filler mixture is measured as follows. Approximately 1 g of the mixture is shaken with 12 g toluene and 12 g aqueous ammonia for 24 hours. The filler is removed from the toluene layer by centrifugation. The toluene layer is collected by decantation and the toluene is then evaporated. The residue is dissolved in toluene to give a residue content of 1 weight percent. The weight average molecular weight is then determined by gel permeation chromatography. The physical properties of the silicone rubber test specimens are measured by the methods of JIS K6301.
