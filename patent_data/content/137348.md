## Description
The present invention relates to a recombinant DNA having inserted therein a gene coding for homoserine kinase, to bacteria carrying the recombinant DNA and to processes for producing L threonine and L isoleucine using the bacteria. A method for improving the L threonine and L isoleucine productivity of Brevibacterium lactofermentum is known from EP A 0 071 023. This method is based on the introduction of a DNA sequence coding for α amino β hydroxy valeric acid into a plasmid vector and transforming a host strain with the recombinant plasmid. Among the enzymes participating in the formation of L threonine and L isoleucine, the enzyme homoserine kinase hereinafter referred to as HK is an enzyme which catalyzes the formation of phospho homoserine from L homoserine, an intermediate in the formation of L threonine or L isoleucine. It is an object of this invention to provide a recombinant DNA molecule useful for increasing the rate of production of L threonine or L isoleucine. It is a further object of this invention to provide bacteria carrying the recombinant DNA molecule and to provide methods for producing L threonine and L isoleucine using these bacteria. The present invention provides a recombinant DNA molecule comprising a plasmid vector and a coding DNA sequence operationally inserted therein, wherein said recombinant DNA molecule is capable of propagating and said DNA sequence is capable of being expressed in a Coryneform bacterium, which is characterized in that the coding DNA sequence is a gene coding for homoserine kinase obtainable from a recombinant plasmid carried by Brevibacterium lactofermentum FERM BP 578 or FERM BP 579. The invention furthermore provides a Coryneform bacterium carrying the stated recombinant DNA molecule. Furthermore, this invention relates to a process for producing an amino acid selected from L threonine and L isoleucine by fermentation, which comprises cultivating in a culture medium the above defined Coryneform bacterium and isolating said amino acid from said culture medium. These and other objects of the invention as will hereinafter become more readily apparent have been accomplished by providing a recombinant DNA molecule comprising a plasmid vector and a gene coding for homoserine kinase operationally inserted therein, wherein said plasmid vector is capable of propagating and said gene is capable of being expressed in a Coryneform bacterium. Also disclosed as part of the present invention are bacterial transformants containing said recombinant DNA and a process for producing amino acids using said bacteria. A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein The present inventors have paid special attention to Cornyeform bacteria known for producing a great amount of L threonine and started their present research to further increase productivity by taking advantage of recombinant DNA techniques. The inventors have succeeded in isolating, from Coryneform bacteria, a gene coding for HK which participates in the production of L threonine and L isoleucine hereinafter referred to as HK gene . In addition, when the gene is connected with a plasmid vector capable of propagating in cells of Coryneform bacteria and is introduced into the cells of a Coryneform bacterium, a remarkably increased production of L threonine and L isoleucine occurs. Coryneform bacteria are aerobic, Gram positive rods, are non acid fast, and are described in Bergey s Coryneform bacteria also include, in addition to the aforesaid wild strains having glutamic acid productivity, mutants including those which have lost glutamic acid productivity Isolation of the HK gene can be conducted by any known method of gene isolation, of which the following method is a preferred method. Firstly, a chromosomal gene is extracted from a strain of Coryneform bacteria carrying an HK gene there can be utilized, for example, the method of H. Saito and K. Miura, To cleave the chromosomal genes, a wide variety of restriction enzymes can be employed. The degree of cleavage can be controlled by controlling the time for the cleavage reaction, the temperature, etc., as is well known to those skilled in the art. The plasmid vector used in the present invention can be any vector as long as it can be propagated in cells of Coryneform bacteria. Specific examples include the following Other examples of plasmids capable of propagating in cells of Coryneform bacteria include pCG 1 Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application 57 134500 , pCG 2 Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application 58 35197 , and pCG 4 and pCG 11 Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application 57 183799 . All of these plasmids can be used in the practice of the present invention. The vector DNA is cleaved by the same restriction enzyme used for cleavage of the chromosomal gene, or the vector DNA is connected with on oligonucleotide having a complementary base sequence at its respective terminals for the chromosomal DNA cleavage fragment and the cleaved vector DNA. The resulting composite is then subjected to a ligation reaction to join the plasmid vector and the chromosomal DNA fragment. When a gene is inserted by this or any other method in the sense direction and in proper reading frame so that the HK enzyme is expressed when the plasmid is transcribed and translated by the genetic machinery of a cell in which the plasmid is inserted, the gene is said to be operationally inserted into the plasmid vector. The incorporation of the thus obtained recombinant DNA comprising the chromosomal DNA and the vector plasmid into recipients belonging to Coryneform bacteria can be done by any known method, of which the following are preferred examples. The recipient cells can be treated with calcium chloride to increase the permeability of DNA, as is reported regarding In the protoplast method, a sufficiently high frequency can be obtained even by the method used for After transformation, bacterial strains that acquire HK productivity or express properties as markers further possessed by the plasmid vectors are isolated as the desired transformants. Such transformants carry the recombinant DNAs harbouring the HK gene. To isolate the recombinant DNA, for example, bacteria are lysed by treating with lysozyme and SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate and then treated with phenol. Then a 2 fold volume of ethanol is added to thereby precipitate and recover DNAs. The methods of culturing the L threonine or L isoleucine producing bacteria thus obtained are conventional and are similar to the methods for the cultivation of conventional L threonine or L isoleucine producing bacteria. That is, the culture medium can be a conventional medium containing carbon sources, nitrogen sources, and inorganic ions and, when required, organic micro nutrients such as vitamins and amino acids. Examples of carbon sources include glucose, sucrose, lactose and starch as well as hydrolysates which contain these carbon sources such as whey and molasses. Examples of nitrogen sources include gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, ammonium salts and others. Cultivation is conducted under aerobic conditions in which the pH and the temperature of the medium are adjusted to a suitable level, and cultivation is continued until the formation and accumulation of L threonine or L isoleucine cease. Thus, markedly high amounts of L threonine or L isoleucine are formed and accumulated in the culture medium. To recover L threonine or L isoleucine from the culture medium, any conventional manner is applicable, such as crystallization or absorption through column chromatography. In addition to the above general procedures which can be used for preparing amino acid producing bacteria in accordance with the practices of this invention, other known techniques and modifications thereof can be used in carrying out the practice of the invention. In particular, techniques relating to genetic engineering have recently undergone exclusive growth and development. Many recent U.S. patents disclose plasmids, genetically engineered microorganisms, and methods of conducting genetic engineering which can be used in the practice of the present invention.

All of these patents as well as all other patents and other publications cited in this disclosure are indicative of the level of skill of those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains and are all herein incorporated by reference. The invention now being generally described, the same will be better understood by reference to certain specific examples which are included herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention or any embodiment thereof, unless specified. The mutant AJ 11188 FERM P 4190 resistant to α amino β hydroxyvaleric acid as described in Japanese Published Examined Patent Application 56 3038 Using pAJ 1844 molecular weight, 5.4 megadaltons as a vector, its DNAs were prepared as follows After treatment with phenol, a two fold volume of ethanol was added to precipitate and harvest DNAs. The precipitates were dissolved in a small amount of a TEN buffer solution 20 mM tris hydrochloride, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaCl adjusted to pH 8.0 . Then, they were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to fractionate and harvest approximately 15 µg plasmid DNA of pAJ 1844. Chromosomal DNAs, 20 µg, obtained in part 1 above, and 10 µg of plasmid DNAs were individually treated at 37 C for 1 hour with restriction endonuclease Pst I to fully cleave them. After heat treatment at 65 C for 10 minutes, both reaction liquids were mixed, and the mixture was subjected to a ligation reaction between the DNA chains with DNA ligase derived from T₄ phage at 10 C for 24 hours in the presence of ATP and dithiothreitol. After heat treatment at 65 C for 5 minutes, a 2 fold volume of ethanol was added to the reaction liquid to precipitate and harvest DNAs after completion of the ligation reaction. As a method for transformation, the protoplast transformation method was used. Firstly, the strain was cultured in 5 ml of CMG liquid medium to reach an early exponential growth phase. After adding 0.6 unit ml of penicillin G thereto, shake culture was performed for a further 1.5 hour. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 0.5 ml of SMMP medium pH 6.5 composed of 0.5 M sucrose, 20 mM maleic acid, 20 mM magnesium chloride and 3.5 Penassay broth Difco . Then the cells were suspended in SMMP medium containing 10 mg ml of lysozyme to cause protoplastation at 30 C for 20 hours. After centrifugation at 6000 x g for 10 minutes, the protoplasts were washed with SMMP and resuspended in 0.5 ml of SMMP. The thus obtained protoplasts were mixed with 10 µg of DNAs prepared in part 3 above in the presence Of 5 mM EDTA. After polyethylene glycol was added to the mixture to give a final concentration of 30 , the mixture gas allowed to stand for 2 minutes at room temperature to incorporate DNAs into the protoplast. After the protoplasts were washed with 1 ml of SMMP medium, the protoplasts were resuspended in 1 ml of SMMP medium. The suspension was incubated at 30 C for 2 hours to effect phenotypic expression. The culture liquid was spread on protoplast regeneration medium at pH 7.0. The protoplast regeneration medium contained, per one liter of distilled water, 12 g of tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, 0.5 g of KCl, 10 g of glucose, 8.1 g of MgCl₂.6H₂O, 2.2 g of CaCl₂.2H₂O 4 g of peptone, 4 g of powdered yeast extract, 1 g of Casamino acid Difco Company , 0.2 g of K₂HPO₄, 135 g of sodium succinate, 8 g of agar and 3 µg ml of chloramphenicol. After culturing at 30 C for 2 weeks, approximately 10,000 colonies resistant to chloramphenicol appeared, which were replicated in a threonine free medium Thr deficient medium 2 glucose, 1 ammonium sulfate, 0,25 urea, 0,1 dihydrogen potassium phosphate, 0.04 magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 2 ppm iron ions, 2 ppm manganese ions, 200 µg l thiamine hydrochloride and 50 µg l biotin pH 7.0, agar 1.8 to obtain 8 strains resistant to chloramphenicol and having lost the auxotrophy for threonine. These strains were treated in a manner described in part 2 above to prepare the lysate. Plasmid DNAs were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Plasmids obviously larger than vector pAJ 1844 were detected from two strains. The typical strain was named AJ 12079 FERM BP 578 In order to confirm that the HK gene was present on the recombinant plasmid pAJ 211 in AJ 12079, Ten strains were selected from each of the thus formed chloramphenicol resistant colonies. Examination of auxotrophy for threonine indicated that the auxotrophy was lost in all of the colonies, and it became clear that the HK genes were present on the recombinant plasmids described above. Plasmid pAJ 211 was introduced into Brevibacterium lactofermentum AJ 11188, a threonine producing mutant resistant to α amino β hydroxyvaleric acid, using the protoplast transformation method described above. A transformant was selected by chloramphenicol resistance. The strains thus obtained, AJ 12080 FERM BP 579 and AJ 12079 mentioned above, were inoculated on 20 ml of threonine producing medium consisting of 10 g dl of glucose, 4.5 g dl of NH₄ ₂SO₄, 0.1 g dl of KH₂PO₄ 0.1 g dl of MgSO₄.7H₂O, 2 ppm of Fe² , 2 ppm of Mn² , 300 µg dl of thiamine HCl, 10 µg l of biotin, 45 mg dl of soybean protein hydrolysate Mieki as total nitrogen , pH 7.2, 5 g dl of CaCO₃ separately sterilized, this medium being supplemented with L homoserine for AJ 12078 and 12079, and with 25 mg dl of L isoleucine and 30 mg dl of L leucine for AJ 11188 and AJ 12080. These strains were shake cultured at 30 C for 72 hours. After incubation, L threonine in the supernatant centrifuged was quantitatively determined by microbioassay. The results are given in Table 1. In the colonies appearing on the medium, strains from which plasmids had been removed were those showing sensitivity to chloramphenicol 10 µg ml , namely AJ 12078 and AJ 11188. The invention now being fully described, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without parting from the spirit or scope of the invention as set forth herein.
