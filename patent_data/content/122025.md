## Description
METHOD FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF EPOXIDES FROM 1,2 GLYCOLS This invention relates to the manufacture of epoxides. More specifically, this invention relates to the manufacture of epoxides from 1,2 glycols. In one of its more specific aspects, this invention pertains to a method for converting 1,2 propylene glycol directly to propylene oxide without forming an ester intermediate. The vapor phase and liquid phase cracking of propylene glycol monoacetate ester to propylene oxide is well known. In general for this process feeds include various mixtures of propylene glycol mono and di acetate often containing same propylene glycol. However, an avail able source of ester, usually from the acetoxylation of propylene, is required or is generated in situ through for example, the use of a alkali metal acetate supported catalyst. U.S. 4,226,780 teaches the manufacture of propylene oxide from 1,2 propylene glycol using as the catalyst a weakly acetic carrier and an added basic alkali metal salt of a low molecular weight carboxylic acid. It has now been found that the vapor phase dehydration of 1,2 glycols to epoxides can be carried out directly, without forming an ester intermediate, over an alkali metal silicate catalyst supported or unsupported on a carrier. Moreover, epoxide yield is high and selectivity is excellent. According to this invention there is provided a method for the production of epoxides which comprises heating a 1,2 glycol in the vapor phase at a reaction temperature of from about 250 to 5000C. over a catalyst which consists essentially of an alkali metal silicate supported or unsupported on a carrier. In a preferred embodiment, the process of this invention is employed to produce propylene oxide directly from 1,2 propylene glycol. In another embodiment, it has been found that the addition of acetic acid to the glycol feed significantly enhances epoxide selectivity without affecting catalyst activity. The alkali metal silicate catalyst can be composed of any suitable alkali metal salt such as lithium, sodium and, preferably, potassium Carriers found useful are CL alumina, zircon and a refractory metal oxide consisting of 94 by weight CL alumina, 5 by weight CaO, and 1 CuO. In general for supported silicates 5 20 weight percent of the salt on the carrier is employed. In the practice of this invention, 1,2 glycol feed concentrations, acetic acid feed concentrations and residence times based on catalyst void space can be varied between wide ranges. Preferably, 1,2 glycol feed concentrations will be within the range of 10 70 mol . Acetic acid feed concentration, if employed, will be within the range of from about 0.5 to 5 mol and residence times will be within the range of from about 0.5 and 2 seconds. The following examples further demonstrate catalyst preparation and the nanufacture of epoxides according to this invention.
