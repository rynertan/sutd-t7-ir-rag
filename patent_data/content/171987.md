# Separator for sorting particulate material.

## Abstract
A separator for sorting particulate material suspended in a conveying gas into coarse and fine fractions has a rotor 1 with two sets 9,10 of vanes. Dampers 13,14 in outlet ducts for the fine fraction regulate the relative flow through the two vane sets and hence control the cut between the fine fraction and the coarse fraction which is flung centrifugally outwards by the vanes and falls down inside a casing 3 .
