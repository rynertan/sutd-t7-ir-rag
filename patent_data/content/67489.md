# Method of continuously fabricating optical fibres and an apparatus for use in this method.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus of fabricating an optical fibre by means of the double crucible method is described, in which a double crucible 1, 13 is used of which at least the inner crucible 1 has a double walled construction. The double wall accommodates a metal wire coil 3 . During the fabrication of the optical fibre 21 the core glass 10 is heated by means of a high frequency electric field and the crucible wall 1 is cooled with a cooling liquid.
