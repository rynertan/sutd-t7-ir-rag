# A master cylinder and vacuum brake booster.

## Abstract
A vaccuum brake booster is provided with a front shell coupled to a master cylinder and a rear shell adapted for attachment to a vehicle fire wall. The front shell is provided with a unidirectional arcuate portion between radially inner and outer extremes in order to reduce the normal force imparted to the front shell during braking and thereby reduce deflection.
