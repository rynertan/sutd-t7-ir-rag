# Two module head, read after write bi directional tape drive.

## Abstract
A digital tape drive wherein tape is written, and a read after write operation is immediately performed to check the integrity of the write operation, for either direction 11, 12 of tape movement. The tape 10 contains a plurality of parallel data tracks. Two read write head modules 14, 15 span the entire tape. The read R and write W gaps of each module are alternately spaced across the width of the tape, such that the write gaps of one module are aligned with the read gaps of the other module. When one module is selected for writing, as a function of the direction of tape movement, the other mod ule is selected to read after write check the first module s written data. One module 14 writes odd track data during one direction 11 of tape movement, and reads even track data during the opposite direction 12 of tape movement as the other module 15 writes even track data during said opp osite movement direction 12 , and reads odd track data dur ing said one movement direction 11 . Common read and write electronic circuits are switched between the two modu les, since each module is using only one of its read and write gap multiples at any given time.
