## Description
DESCRIPTION DOGTechnical Field This invention relates to a dog for a detector switch, for example, a limit switch, which is used to detect a position to which a machine is moved.Background Art A conventional dog of this kind, which is shown in Figs. 1 3, is made of steel. The dog has in its central portion a through bore b, through which a screw stud a is inserted, the bore b extending in the axial direction of the dog. The dog is further provided with a slit c extending in the same direction as the through bore b and having portions extending above and below the through bore b.A slit portion d of the dog, through which the lower portion of the slit c extends to be opened downward, is provided at one side of an outer cir circular cumferential surface thereof with a spot faced bore e and a bolt inserting bore f, which extend at right angles to the slit c, and which communicate with each other. The other side of the outer circum slit d provided with ferential surface of the crececnS portiontsSa threaded bore g communicating with the bolt inserting bore f. When a hexagonal bore carrying bolt h is inserted into the spot faced bore e to be tightened by turning a hexagonal rod spanner S, the slit portion d is bent, tightening on the screw stud a inserted in the through bore b and causing the dog i to be fixed thereto. The operation for making the threaded bore g in the conventional dog constructed as described above is started at a predetermined portion of a curved outer circumferential surface thereof.Therefore, an edged tool used shows a marked tendency to escape along the curved surface at the initial stage of the bore making operation. to be madei Consequently, the bore cannot be centered, and is difficult to make. Since the bore must be made accurately, a considerably skilled hand is required. Setting and regulating adjusting such a dog is often done in a narrow place between the machine various other and mac ine In a dog of a conventional construction, the hexagonal rod spanner S can be fitted into only one side thereof, i.e. the side in which the spot faced bore e is provided. This causes much trouble in the handling of the spannerS. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide in view of the above mentioned points a dog capable of being tightened from either side and manufactured very simply, eliminating the drawbacks encountered in a conventional dog of this kind.Disclosure of Invention The dog according to the present invention is provided at both sides of an outer circumferential carrying surface of a slit section 8 thereof with hexagonal spot faced bores 9, 11 and bolt inserting bores 10, 12, which extend at right angles to a slit 7, and which communicate with each other, in such a manner that the bores 9, 11 and the bores 10, 12 are symmetrically opposed to each other. Accordingly, either a hexagonal bore carrying bolt 13 or a hexagonal nut 14 can be inserted or fitted into either the spot faced bore 9 or the spot faced bore 11, and the dog can be tightened from either of two opposite directions. This enables setting and adjusting the dog to be done easily in a narrow space, and the efficiency of the operation to be improved. Unlike a conventional dog, the dog according to the present invention does not require a threaded bore, which is difficult to make in a curved outer circumferential surface, to be provided. This enables the dog to be manufactured simply, and the cost of manufacturing the same to be reduced.Brief Description of Drawings Figs. 1 3 are a left side elevation view, a front elevation view partially in section, and a right side elevation view partially in section, of a conventional dog Figs. 4 6 are a left side elevation view, a front elevation view partially in section, and a right side elevation view partially in section, of an example of a dog according to the present invention, Fig. 6also illustrates a limit switch relative to the dog and Figs. 7 and 8 are a front elevation view partially in section, and a right side elevation view of another example of a dog according to the present invention, Fig. 8 also illustrates a limit switch relative to the dog.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention An example of a dog according to the present invention applied to a limit switch will be described with reference to Figs. 4 6. Reference numeral I denotes a limit switch, 2 a roller for the limit switch, 3 a casing, and 4 a dog body for the limit switch 1. A principal portion 4a of the dog body 4is made, for example, of a synthetic resin so as to manufacture the dog easily and reduce the weight thereof. An outer circumferential surface of the principal portion 4a is plated, for example, with hard chromium 4b to prevent the portion of the outer surface of the dog which contacts the roller 2 for the limit switch 1 from being worn and the outer surface of the dog from being damaged by sparks during cutting and welding operations.When the principal portion 4a consisting of a synthetic resin is plated in such a manner, a metal film is formed on its outer circumferential surface, so that such a dog can be used not only for a limit switch but also for a proximity switch or a non contact carrying switch. The dog is provided at its central portion with a through bore 6 extending in the axial direction thereof and formed to enable a screw stud 5 to be inserted therethrough, and a slit 7 extending in the same direction as the through bore 6 and consisting of portions extending above and below ocarryinq, the through bore 6. A slit section 8, in which the slit 7 extends opening downward, is provided at both sides of its outer circumferential surface with bolt tightening and inserting hexagonal spotfaced bores 9, 11 and bolt inserting bores 10, 12, which bores 9, 11 and 10, 12 extend at right angles to the slit 7 and communicate with each other. tsymmetrically, The bores 9, 11 and 10, 12 are provided opposing each other. Namely, one side of the outer circum rryingJ ferential surface of the slit section 8 8is provided with a bolt tightening and inserting hexagonal spot faced bore 9 and a bolt inserting bore 10 communicating with the bore 9, so that these bores 9, 10 extend at right angles to the slit 7 the other side portion of the outer circumferential surface of the slit carrying section 8 is provided with a bolt tightening and inserting hexagonal spot faced bore 11 and a bolt inserting bore 12 communicating with each other and positioned in symmetric opposition to and shaped identically with the bores 9, 10, respectively. Referring to the drawings, reference numeral 13 denotes a hexagonal borecarrying bolt inserted into one spot faced bore 9, and 14 a hexagonal nut inserted into the other spot faced bore 11 to be screwed to the bolt 13. Figs. 7 and 8 illustrate another example of the present invention, i.e. a disc type dog formed by utilizing the techniques according to the present invention. As is clear from these drawings, the techniques according to the present invention can be applied to various shapes of dogs. Industrial Applicability A method of tightening a dog according to the present invention will be described. First, the dog body 4 is fitted around the screw stud 5, and the hexagonal bore carrying bolt 13 is inserted into either of the hexagonal spot faced bore 9, 11 with the hexagonal nut 14 inserted into the other tspot facedJ hexagonal bc c r 4r bore 11 or 9. When the bolt 13 is turned by the hexagonal rod spanner 15 into the nut 14 fitted in the bore 11 or 9, the carryin slit section 8 is bent gradually to tighten the screw stud 5. Consequently, the dog body 4 is fixed to the screw stud 5.
