## Description
The present invention relates to a hermetic terminal assembly adapted to be hermetically secured to an opening in a motor unit housing comprising a cover member having at least one hole therein a current conducting pin extending through said hole, said pin having an outer end to extend externally of said housing to receive an electrical connection to a current source and an inner end to extend within said housing to receive an electrical connection to a motor disposed in said housing, said inner end of said pin having a flange extending generally radially therefrom, said flange having an inner face facing said inner end of said pin a seal bonding said pin to the inside surface defining said cover member hole and a hollow electrically insulating sleeve surrounding said pin and said flange extending therefrom with the outer axial extremity of said sleeve being bonded to said seal said inner end of said pin having a fuse like area adjacent the inner face of said flange. A hermetic terminal assembly of this type is disclosed in US A 4,461,925 EP A 0 073 731 . In US A 4,461,925, the inner end of the pin that is the end of the pin on the dish side surface of the cup shaped body is provided with a radially extending flange of a major diameter larger than the diameter of the hole defined by an annular sealing lip, the flange being axially located relative the pin adjacent the inner extremity of an electrically insulating sleeve surrounding the pin in immediate or close proximity to such pin. Further in US A 4,461,925, the inner end of the pin is provided with a reduced neck, positioned axially relative the pin immediately adjacent the flange on the inside surface of the cup shaped body to provide, in effect, a fuse like area. Reference is also made to FR A 2 280 189 which discloses a circuit interrupter cartridge having a fuse consisting of a tubular shaft embedded in an insulating body. The tubular shaft has at least one cutout forming an active center portion thereof. The object of the invention is to provide an improved hermetic terminal assembly which is safer than known terminal assemblies of the recited type, confines the area of possible pin melting and prevents the pin from leaving the housing shell. According to the invention, to achieve this the hermetic terminal assembly is characterized in that the inner axial extremity of said sleeve extends at an axial location relative said pin substantially beyond the axial location of the inner face of said flange to provide an extended tortuous path between said flange on said pin and said cover member to minimize the possibility of electrical arcing therebetween, and that said fuse like area is formed by an aperture in said pin spaced from the flange thereof and located within the compass of said sleeve. The hermetic terminal assembly provided with the fuse like area according to the invention is straightforward, efficient and economical to manufacture and assemble, and utilizes a minimum of materials. Other advantageous features are recited in the dependent claims 1 through 7. Referring to the drawings which discloses one advantageous embodiment of the terminal assembly of this invention and a modified alternative pin arrangement therefor As can be seen in Figures 1 and 5, the hermetic terminal assembly, broadly indicated by reference numeral 2, includes a cover member which in the drawing is shown as a cup shaped body 3 having a generally flat bottom 4 and a sidewall 6 with an outwardly flaring rim 7. The flat bottom 4 has a dish or inner surface 8 and an outer or outside surface 9 and at least one hole or opening 11 defined by annular sealing lip 12 extending from inner surface 8 with an inside wall surface 13, a free inner extremity or edge 14 and a radius or outside edge 16. As can be seen in Figure 2, cup shaped body 3 is, in fact, provided with three such openings 11, all of which can incorporate similar annular sealing lip arrangements as described heretofore and a similar pin and sleeve arrangements as described hereinafter. As can again be seen in Figure 1, extending through each hole 11 is a current conducting pin 17. Each pin 17 includes an outer end 18 which extends externally of cup shaped body 3 and, of course, the motor unit housing having an opening in which the terminal assembly 2 is mounted not illustrated herein . The outer end 18, the extremity of which can be stepped down, serves to be connected to a suitable electric current source also not illustrated herein . Each pin 17 further includes an inner end 19 which extends beyond annular sealing lip 12, this inner end, which also can have a stepped down extremity, serves to receive an electrical connection disposed in the motor unit housing to which assembly 2 is mounted. It is to be noted as shown in Figure 3 that pin 17 can include an outer jacket 10 and an inner core 20, the core 20 being of a highly conductive material such as copper and the jacket being of a less conductive material, such as a steel alloy. As can be seen in Figure 1 and 3, inner end 19 of pin 17 includes a flange 21 formed from the outer jacket 10 and extending generally radially therefrom. It is to be noted that in the embodiment disclosed the diameter of flange 21 is less than the diameter of hole 11 defined by annular sealing lip 12. With such an arrangement of a small diameter flange it is possible to form the outer jacket 10 of pin 17 and flange 21 by a suitable forming process from corrosion resistent, stainless steel with a high chromium content, thus enhancing the bonding process of the pin in the glass seal, desribed hereinafter. Referring particularly to Figure 1, it can be seen that when pin 17 is assembled with cup shaped body 3, flange 21 is positioned in the embodiment disclosed at an axial location relative cup shaped body 3 intermediate the inner extremity 14 of annular sealing lip 12 and the inner extremity of flaring rim 7 of cup shaped body 3. To bond pin 17 in this selected position to the inner wall surface 13 of annular sealing lip 12, a glass seal 22 is provided, this glass seal, which is heat softened in an oven in the bonding process, also serves to receive and bond in place an extremity of hollow electrically insulating sleeve 23 which can be of a suitable ceramic such as alumina or steatite. Referring to Figure 6, it can be seen that ceramic sleeve 23 includes a hollow cylindrical body portion 24 and a truncated cone portion 26. As can be seen in Figure 1, when the terminal is assembled, the cylindrical body portion 24 is sized to have an inner wall diameter larger than the diameter of hole 11 defined by annular sealing lip 12 to surround pin 17 and flange 21 radially extending from pin 17. It is to be noted that the inner axial extremity 27 of cylindrical body portion 24 extends at an axial location relative pin 17 substantially beyond the axial location of inner face 28 of flange 21. Thus, with this arrangement of the terminal assembly 2, the tortuous distance of free travel from flange 21 to the inner edge 14 of annular sealing lip 12 would be along the inner and outer walls of cylindrical body portion 24 of sleeve 23 and a substantial portion of the outer wall of truncated cone portion 26, thus minimizing the possibilities of electrical arcing between flange 21, which, as aforenoted, is of reduced diameter, and annular sealing lip 12. To enhance the assembly and bonding of ceramic sleeve 23 to glass seal 22 and annular lip 12, the extremity of truncated cone portion 26 of ceramic sleeve 23 is provided with a generally cylindrical extremity 29. The outer wall diameter of cylindrical extremity 29 is sized to conform closely with and nest in hole 11 defined by annular sealing lip 12 and is of sufficient axial breadth to engage with and be bonded to glass seal 22 during the bonding process. Referring particularly to Figures 1, 5 and 6, it is to be noted that the inner edge or extremity 14 of annular sealing lip 12 is tapered along the inner wall thereof, as indicated by reference numeral 31, to conform with tapered outer wall 32 of truncated cone portion 26 of ceramic sleeve 23 which bears thereagainst. It further is to be noted that the inner wall of truncated portion 26 of sleeve 23 includes an inner annular ledge 33 which is of a diameter less than the diameter of flange 21. This ledge 33 serves to arrest flange 21 in the event of glass seal softening. As can be seen in Figure 1, in assembly, the opposite face 34 of flange 21 is axially spaced from annular ledge 33 a sufficient distance to accommodate for the different coefficients of expansion of the ceramic sleeve 23, the glass seal 22, the cup shaped body 3 and the stainless steel pin 17. It is to be understood that the spacing would vary, depending upon the types of materials utilized for the aforedescribed parts. Referring to Figures 1 and 3, it can be seen that the inner end 19 of pin 17 has a cylindrical aperture 36 adjacent to but spaced from inner face 28 of flange 21. Aperture 36 is arranged of flange 21. Aperture 36 is arranged within the compass of the sleeve 23 and extends axially through the longitudinal axis of the pin 17, the aperture being sized to be less in diameter and cross sectional area than highly conductive core 20 to form, in effect, a fuse like area well within the inner axial extremity 27 of insulating sleeve 23 so that if excessive heating of the pin occurs, the pin will melt in this area, the melting being contained by sleeve 23 away from flange 21 thereby protecting both the motor and persons in the vicinity. When this occurs, contained gas forces in the housing will likely cause opposite or outer face 34 of flange 21 to abut against annular ledge 33 in truncated cone portion 26 of sleeve 23 to thus retain the outer end 18 of pin 17, transmitting the force through the conforming tapered outer wall 32 of truncated cone 26 and tapered extremity 31 along the inner wall of annular sealing lip 12. Thus, from the above it can be seen that the present invention provides a further novel hermetic terminal assembly which can be readily manufactured and assembled to control the area of possible pin melting, to prevent the pin from shorting and leaving the housing shell and to improve sealing, providing maximum surface between pin and housing. It is to be understood that various changes can be made in the embodiment disclosed. For example, it would be possible to provide a flat cover member without a rim 7 and or an annular sealing lip 12, the cover member being of sufficient thickness to insure sealed bonding between the surface defining the cover member hole and the pin. It also would be possible to provide a cover member, flat or with a rim, with an annular sealing lip 12 which extends in an opposite direction from the lip as disclosed in the drawing that is from outside wall surface 9.
