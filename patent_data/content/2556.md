## Description
NOVEL INTERMEDIATE IN THE PREPARATION OF CYCLOPROPYLCARBOXYLATE ESTERS AND PROCESS FOR ITS MANUFACTURE The invention relates to a compound which is a useful intermediate in the preparation of cyclopropylcarboxylate esters.The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the compound. The cyclopropylcarboxylate esters are insecticidally active compounds known as pyrethroids and as they combine exceptionally good insecticidal properties with a very low mammalian toxicity, they are of considerable interest to the agrochemical industry and much effort has been expended in finding conomic routes to them and to their principal intermediates. The general formula of one class of these pyrethroid compounds may be represented as follows EMI1.1 where each asterisk denotes an asymmetric carbon atom each X is a halogen atom and R is a member of a group of radicals known to impart insecticidal activity to the molecule, e.g. 3 phenoxybenzyl or alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl. It is known that the stereoisomeric form of the acid portion of the ester of formula I should be in the 1R, cis form for maximum insecticidal activity i.e. the absolute configuration at carbon atom 1 is R and the two hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms 1 and 3 are in a cis relationship. This nomenclature is known as the Elliott nomenclature and is defined in M. Elliott, A.W. Farnham, N.F. James, P.H. Needham and D.A. Pullman, Nature, 1974, 248, 710. It follows, therefore, that if these stereoisomeric esters of formula I are to be prepared, either a stereospecific chemical route is required or the desired stereo isomer must be obtained from a racemic form by physical separation techniques. The latter are expensive and laborious and not readily employed on an industrial scale. The Applicant has found a stereospecific route which uses as starting material the naturally occurring substance 3 carene whose formula is as follows EMI2.1 This compound is an inexpensive readily available natural terpene and in our copending application UK 52406 77 K. 332 is disclosed a route to the 1R, cis acid portion of the pyrethroid ester of formula I starting from 3 carene and proceeding via the novel cyclopropane compound according to the invention. The present invention provides 3 acetoxymethyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarbaldehyde dimethyl acetal whose formula is EMI2.2 Preferably the compound of formula III is in the same stereoisomeric form as that of the cyclopropane ring of 3 carene because this form leads to compounds of general formula I R H in the 1R, cis form such compounds generate optimum levels of insecticidal activity in the pyrethroid end product. The compound III or its preferred stereoisomeric form may be prepared by methods known per se, for example from derivatives of 3 carene employing ozonolysis and subsequent reduction of the peroxidic ozonolysis products formed, see for example, ChemicalReviews 58 1958 925 995. It has been found that the compound may be conveniently prepared by a method which is characterised in that 2 3 acetoxymethyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl vinyl acetate of formula EMI3.1 is subjected to ozonolysis and the ozonolysis product so formed is subjected to reduction in the presence of methanol and an acetalizing catalyst. Preferably Compound IV is employed in the same stereoisomeric form as that of the cyclopropane ring of 3 carene. The ozonolysis is preferably carried out in the presence of methanol. The reduction of the ozonolysis product formed is suitably carried out with dimethyl sulphide. p Toluenesulphonic acid is a good acetalizing catalyst. As has been indicated above a multi stage process for the preparation of insecticidally active compounds, starting with 3 carene and in which the compound according to the invention is employed as intermediate, is described in United Kingdom patent application 52466 77.
