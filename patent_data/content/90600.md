## Description
The present invention relates to the combination of an injection molding device with a microprocessor, and a method to produce capsules of a moldable hydrophilic polymer composition, preferably gelatin. The present invention utilizes gelatin, preferably made from various types of gelatin including acid or alkaline processed ossein, acid processed pigskin, or alkaline processed cattle hide. Said types of various gelatin have a molecular mass angle of 101000 to 2,000,000Dalton or a molecular mass range of it000 to 2.000,0GO and 10,000,000 to 20,000, 000 Dalton. The method for determination of the molecular mass distribution of the various types of gelatin used in the present invention is performed as described in the following references I. Tomka, Chimia. 30, 534 540 1976 I.Tomka, et al, Phot. Sci. 2s, 97 1975 Gelatin having a molecular mass range between 10,000 and 2,000,000 Dalton, was found to give less deformation of capsule parts after ejection from a capsule mold, then in the following description the term gelatin is used, other hydrophilic polymers whose properties are acceptable as capsule materials are also included. Hydrophilic polymers are polymers with molecular masses from approximately 103 to 107 Dalton carrying molecular groups in their backbone and or in their side chains and capable of forming and or participating in hydrogen bridges. Such hydrophilic polymers exhibit in their water adsorption isotherm in the temperature range between approximately 0 to 2000C an inflection point close to the water activity point at 0.5.Hydrophilic polymers are distinguished from the group called hydrocolloids by their molecular dispersity. For the maintenance of the molecular dispersity of said hydrophilic polymers a fraction of water according to the working range of the present invention of 5 to 25 by wieght of said hydrophilic polymers must be included provided that the temperature of said hydrophilic polymers is in the working range between 500C and 1900c of the present invention. There are other hydrocolloids, not hydrophilic polymers in the sense of this definition, which contain more or less spherical or fibrous particles whereby those particles are composed of several macromolecules of a hydrophilic polymer within the molecular mass range of 103 107 Dalton giving rise to particle sizes between 0.01 10 microns which is the typical range of colloidal particles. It is a primary object of the present invention to utilize hydrophilic polymers in the production of capsules. Attention is drawn to the following applications of related subject matter, namely U.S. Patent ApplicationNo. 362177 and the corresponding European PatentApplication No. filed by us on the same day as the present application and U.S. PatentApplication No. 362181. Capsule making machines have been developed to utilize dip molding technology. Such technology involves the dipping of capsule shaped pins into a gelatin solution, removing the pins from the solution, drying of the gelatin upon the pins, stripping off the gelatin capsule parts from the pins, adjusting for length, cutting, joining and ejecting the capsules. Prior art capsule making machines have utilized the combination of mechanical and pneumatic elements to perform these functions at speeds up to about 1,200 size 0 capsules per minute.While the above described apparatus are in general suitable for the intended purposes, it is desirable to produce capsules at considerably higher speed, over 15,000 size 0 capsules per minute, while at the same time precisely controlling the properties of the gelatin in order to produce the capsules hygienically and with minimum dimensional deviations so that the capsules can be filled on high speed equipment. Shirai et al. in US patent 4,216,240 describes an injection molding process to produce an oriented fibrous protein product. The fibrous product as obtained by this process differs fundamentally from the transparent glasslike material of the capsules obtained from the present invention. Furthermore to obtain a flowable mass for the molding process, the protein mixtures used by Shirai et al. have to be denatured and thus lose their capacity to undergo dissolution. Nakatsuka et al. in US Patent 4,076,B46 uses binary mixtures of starch with salts of protein materials to obtain an edible shaped article by an injection molding process. With the present invention shaped articles from protein materials, preferably gelatin and other hydrophilic polymers can be produced without the addition of starch. Heusdens et al. in U.S. Patent No. 3,911,159 discloses the formation of filamentous protein structures to obtain edible products of improved tenderness. With the present invention shaped articles are produced without a filamentous protein structure. The use of an injection molding device for producing capsules of gelatin and other moldable hydrophilic polymers with similar properties is new and has not been suggested in the technical literature. A prerequisite for any material to be moldable by an injection process is its ability to pass a glass transition point at a temperature compatible with the thermal stability of the material and the technical possibilities of an injection molding device. The present invention provides an improved injection molding device adapted to be automatically controlled by microprocessing techniques and utilizing molding compositions in the form of hydrophilic polymers, such as gelatin, possessing a dissolution point within a temperature range usable for an injection molding process, and which permit the water content to be controlled within a predetermined range to avoid the need for additional steps of either drying or humidifying of the molded product formed by the injection molding device. The present invention covers an improved automatic injection molding device having, a hopper unit for receiving, storing, maintaining and feeding gelatin, and having a discharge outlet an injection unit including, a cylindrical means having an inlet end connected to the outlet for said hopper unit to receive gelatin therefrom, and a transport and ram number rotatably and slidably mounted in said cylindrical means for moving and to permit plasticizing of the gelatin. therein, a molding unit connected to the end of the cylindrical means remote from the inlet end including, capsule part mold means, and means for ejecting molded capsule parts therefrom, normally closed valve means connected between the cylindrical means and the molding unit whereby on movement of the valve means to open position a predetermined quantity of plasticized gelatin will be delivered to said capsule part mold means in the molding unit, a microprocessor having parameters stored in a memory therein to define a plurality of time settings to provide a desired work cycle for said injection unit and said molding unit and the optimum pressure, temperature and water content for the gelatin in the hopper unit, sensing means for sensing and signaling the actual operating times of the injection unit and the molding unit and the temperatures, pressure and water content of the gelatin in the hopper unit, means connected to the sensory means and the microprocessor for detecting the deviation between the actual conditions sensed by said sensory means and the stored parameters in the microprocessor including, means for signaling said deviation, an actuating means connected to said deviation signaling means for adjusting the operation of the hopper, the injection unit and the molding unit to maintain optimum operation of the automatic capsule molding device. Additionally, the present invention also covers methods for molding capsule parts under controlled conditions of time, temperature, pressure and water content of gelatin comprising the steps of a. melting the gelatin, b. dissolving in water the molten gelatin, c. plasticizing the molten gelatin, d. molding the plasticized gelatin by cooling in a closed capsule parts mold, and e. ejecting capsule parts of cooled gelatin from the capsule parts mold. It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a new and improved injection inolding microprocessor apparatus and a method for molding gelatin, which alleviates one or more of the above described disadvantages of the prior art arrangements. It is another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved injection molding microprocessor apparatus and a method of molding gelatin capsules by continuous monitoring and control of the pertinent gelatin parameters in order to prevent degradation of the gelatin and deformation of the capsule parts. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an injection molding microprocessor apparatus and a method of molding gelatin capsules at high speed and with precision in order to use the gelatin capsule with high speed filling equipment. The invention both as to its organization and method of operation together with further objects and advantages thereof will best be understood by reference to the following specifications and taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The function of the hopper unit 5 is receiving, storing, maintaining and feeding gelatin 4 at a constant temperature and at a constant water content.The hopper unit 5 comprises a vertical cylinder 30 having a closed top 3 with an inlet 32 therein to receive gelatin 4. At the bottom of the vertical cylinder 30 is a closed conical funnel 33 and a discharge outlet 34 to feed gelatin 4 into the injection unit 1. There is an air duct 35 communicating between the closed top 31 and the conical funnel 33 wherein air is circulated by a blower 36, the air temperature is controlled by a thyristor 37 and the air relative humidity is controlled by a steam injector 38. The function of the injection unit 1 is melting, dissolving in water and plasticizing in the extruder barrel 17 the gelatin 4 fed from the hopper unit 5 into the extruder inlet 54 and injecting the plasticized gelatin 14 into the molding unit 2. The function of the molding unit 2 is autamatically holding, opening and closing the mold 6 having capsuleshaped cavities 19 therein, and ejecting the capsule parts 7 therefrom. Within the injection unit 1 the screw 8 both rotates and undergoes axial reciprocal motion. when the screw 8 rotates, it performs the functions of melting, dissolving in water and plasticizing the gelatin 4. When the screw 8 moves axially, it performs the function of injecting by transporting and ramming the plasticized gelatin 14 into the mold 6. The screw 8 is rotated by a variable speed hydraulic motor 9 and drive 10, and its axial motion is reciprocated by a duplex hydraulic cylinder 11. Compression of the plasticized gelatin 14 in front of the rotating screw 8 forces back the screw assembly 20 containing the screw 8, the drive 10 and the motor 9. When the screw assembly 20 reaches a pre setback position a limit switch 12 is contacted. When a defined time has elapsed during which the gelatin 4 becomes fully plasticized gelatin 14 the hydraulic cylinder 11 brings the screw assembly 20 forward and uses the screw 8 as a ram for the plasticized gelatin 14 to be injected through a valve body assembly 50 including a one way valve 15, a needle valve 23, a nozzle 22 and an outlet port 21 into the molding unit 2. The one way valve 15 prevents the plasticized gelatin 14 from going back over the helical flutes 16 of the screw 8. The extruder barrel 17 has steam heating coils 18 to heat the gelatin 4 while it is being compressed by the screw 8 into plasticized gelatin 14.It is desirable for the plasticized gelatin 14 to be heated at the lowest possible temperature and to be transported with the lowest possible speed of the screw 8. The speed of the screw 8 and the heating of the plasticized gelatin 14 within the extruder barrel 17 by the steam heating coils 18 control the quality and the output rate of the plasticized gelatin 14 injected into the molding unit 2. The molding unit 2 holds the mold 6 having capsule shaped cavities 19 therein into which the plasticized gelatin 14 is injected and maintained under pressure. Refrigerant cooling conduits 24 encircle the mold 6 so that when the plasticized gelatin t4 in the mold 6 has cooled and sufficiently solidified, the molding unit 2 opens, the mold 6 separates and the capsule parts 7 are ejected. Referring now to Fig. 1 and also to Fig. 2 which depicts the injection molding work cycle for gelatin 4 containing approximately 17 water, by weight plotted against time, temperature and pressure. In general the work cycle of gelatin 4 is as follows in the injection molding device 27 of the present invention a. gelatin 4 is fed into the hopper unit 5 where it is received, stored and maintained under controlled conditions of temperature ranging from ambient to 1000C, pressure ranging from 1 S x 10 5 Newtons per square meter N x m 2 and water content ranging from 5 to 25 by weight of gelatin, b. the stored gelatin is melted under controlled condition of temperature ranging from 50 to 190 C, water content ranging from 5 to 258 by weight of gelatin and pressure ranging from 600 to 3000 x 10 5N x m 2, c. the molten gelatin is dissolved in water under controlled conditions of temperature ranging from 50 to 1900 C, pressures ranging from 600 to 3000 x 10 5 P3 x m 2 and water content ranging from 5 to 25 by weight of gelatin, d. the dissolved gelatin is plasticized under controlled conditions of temperature ranging from 50 to 1900C, pressure ranging from 600 to 3000 x 10 5 N x m 2 and water content ranging from 5 to 25 by weight of gelatin, e. the plasticized gelatin is injected into a capsule shaped part mold 6 under controlled conditions of temperature below 500C, injection pressure ranging from 600 to 3000 x 10 5 N x m 2 and a clamping force of the mold 6 below approximately 600,000 Newton, and f. The capsule shaped parts 7 are ejected from the molded gelatin within the capsule mold 6. Beginning at Point A of Fig. 2 the screw 8 moves forward and fills the mold 6 with plasticized gelatin 14 until Point B and maintains the injected plasticized gelatin 14 under high pressure, during what is called the hold time from Point B until Point C of Fig. 2. AtPoint B the one way valve 15 near the end of the screw 8 prevents the plasticized gelatin 14 from flowing back from the nozzle 22 onto the screw 8. During hold time, additional plasticized gelatin 14 is injected, offsetting contraction due to cooling and solidification of the plasticized gelatin 14. Later, the outlet port 21, which is a narrow entrance to the molding unit 2 closes, thus isolating the molding unit 2 from the injection unit 1. The plasticized gelatin 14 within the mold 6 is still at high pressure.As the plasticized gelatin 14 cools and solidifies, pressure drops to a level that is high enough to ensure the absence of sinkmarks, but not so high that it becomes difficult to remove the capsule parts 7 from the capsule shaped cavities 19 within the mold 6. After the outlet port 21 closes at Point C, screw 8 rotation commences. The plasticized gelatin 14 is accommodated in the increased cylindrical space in front of the screw 8 created by its backward axial motion untilPoint D. The flow rate of the plasticized gelatin 14 is controlled by the speed of the screw 8 and the pressure is controlled by the back pressure i.e., the hydraulic pressure exerted on the screw assembly 20 which in turn determines the pressure in the plasticized gelatin 14 generated in the nozzle 22 in front of the screw 8.After plasticized gelatin 14 generation for the next shot into the mold 6, the screw 8 rotation ceases at Point D. The gelatin 4 on the stationary screw 8 continues to melt,Points D to E, by heat conduction from the steam heating coils 18 on the extruder barrel 17. This period is called soak time. Meanwhile, the solidified capsule parts 7 are ejected from the mold 6 Thereafter the mold 6 closes to accept the next shot of plasticized gelatin 14. All of these operations are automated and controlled by a microprocessor as hereinafter described. Referring now to Fig. 2 and and also to Fig. 3.The injection molding work cycle of Fig. 2 is accomp lished on the injection molding device 27 of Fig. 3 by hydraulic and electrical components and the correspond ing circuits controlled by the microprocessor 28 of Fig. 3. Through the use of solid state circuitry. and speed temperature, limit and pressure switches for the electric and hydraulic systems, the microprocessor 28 of the present invention utilized command signals in its memory for the parameters of time, temperature and pressure conditions of Table 1 below for the injection nolding work cycle of Fig. 2 to be accomplished by the injection molding device 27 of Fig. 3 in producing gelatin capsule parts 7.

The combined injection molding device 27 and microprocessor 28 comprises Six control circuits of which five are closed loop, fully analog, and one is on off. Starting at molding cycle Point A in Fig. 2, the injection molding work cycle operates as follows When sufficient plasticized gelatin 14 has accumu lated in front of the screw 8 microprocessor time controlled and also when the screw assembly 20 carrying the screw 8, drive 9 and hydraulic motor 11 has been pushed far enough backwards against a constant backpressure as controlled by control circuit 2, limit switch 12 will be actuated by sensing circuit 14. Upon these two conditions the hydraulic valve, control circuit 4 is actuated causing the hydraulic fluid to flow into the forward portion of the hydraulic cylinder 11. This rams the screw assembly 20 forward, thus injecting the plasticized gelatin 14 into the mold 6 when molding cycle Point B of Fig. 2 is reached, and, as controlled by the microprocessor 28. the screw 8 remains for a certain period of time until Point C stationary in this forward position under high pressure. From molding cycle Point B of Fig. 2 onwards the plasticized gelatin 14 cools down in the mold 6 and the port 21 closes at molding cycle Point C of Fig. 2. At molding cycle Point C of Fig. 2 the screw 8 starts to rotate again and the hydraulic pressure reduced from the forward portion of the hydraulic cylinder 11 to a pressure slightly less than the pressure set for the backward portion of the hydraulic cylinder 11. The screw 8 is kept under constant pressure towards the mold 6 by the pressure in the back position of the hydraulic cylinder 11. This is achieved by means of the control circuit 2 where a proportional hydraulic valve is controlled by a pressure circuit sensor 12. As the screw 8 rotates a recharge of gelatin 4 is made from the hopper 5. During a certain time period and at a defined rotating speed of the screw 8, controlled by control circuit 3, a precise amount of gelatin 4 is fed into the extruder barrel 17. Control circuit 3 is actuated by a speed sensor circuit 13 measuring the rotating speed of the screw 8 and sensing back to a hydraulic proportional flow control valve 03, controlled by control circuit 3, thus assuring a constant rotating speed of the hydraulic motor 10, irrespective of the changing torque resulting from introduction of the gelatin 4 recharge. When the load time is completed, the screw 8 rotation is stopped and molding cycle Point D of Fig. 2 is reached. The soak time from molding cycle Points D to A of Fig. 2 allows for the gelatin 14 to plasticize completely under controlled temperature conditions as controlled by control circuit 1. A temperature sensor circuit I1 senses a thyristor heat regulator Cl heating the extruder barrel 17 as directed by control circuit 1. During the time interval from molding cycle PointsB to E on Fig. 2, the mold 6 has cooled down sufficiently so that the finished capsule parts 7 can be ejected from the mold 6. After ejection of the capsule parts 7, the work cycle returns to Point A of Fig. 2 where a certain volume of plasticized gelatin 14 has accumulated in front of the screw 8 sensory circuit 14 is actuated and time has elapsed so that the work cycle of Fig. 2 can be repeated. It is important to note the temperature and humidity control loops 5 and 6, for the maintenance of precise water content of the gelatin in the hopper 5, which is essential for proper operation at the desired speeds. The microprocessor 28 includes a memory section 51 to store the desired operating parameters a sensing and signalling section 52 to receive the sensing signals of actual operating conditions, to detect the deviation between the desired and actual operating conditions, and to send signals for adjustment through the actuating section 53 to the thyristors and valves. Referring now to Fig. 4 there is shown the valve body assembly 50 including the outlet port 21, the nozzle 22, the needle valve 23, and the one way valve 15 These elements operate as follows At Point A in Fig. 2 the needle valve 23 is retracted from the outlet port 21 and the one way valve 15 is retracted from the valve body 50 so as to form an inlet opening 55 for plasticized gelatin 14 into the nozzle 22 which defines a charging chamber for plasticized gelatin 14. The plasticized gelatin 14 is injected through the nozzle 22 and into the mold 6 during the mold filling time between Points A and B in Fig. 2. AtPoint C in Fig. 2 the needle valve 23 is pushed forward so as to close the outlet port 21 during which time, between Points C and E in Fig. 2, the mold 6 is closed and the capsule part 7 in the mold 6 is cooling.The needle valve 23 remains closed between Point E and A inFig. 2 during which time the capsule part 7 is ejected from the mold 6. The total time period between Point B and A in Fig. 2 must be less than 5 seconds so that the plasticized gelatin 14 does not solidify in the nozzle 22. This is an important aspect of the present invention because a faster production times are made possible in order to achieve greater output b there is no loss of plasticized gelatin 14 in the production cycle due to solidification in the nozzle 22 and the mold 6 and c there is a minimum risk of degradation of the plasticized gelatin because it remains in the production cycle for a short time and is only utilized once in each production cycle because the plasticized gelatin 14 is solidified only once in the capsule shaped cavities 19 and not in the nozzle 22. The one way valve 15 and the needle valve 23 are actuated by a spring tensioned lever 25 which normally closes both the outlet port 21 and the nozzle 22 until the lever 25 is cam actuated pursuant to signals from the microprocessor 28. The thermomechanical properties of gelatin, i.e.storage and loss shear modules at different temperatures, are strongly dependent on its water content. The capsule molding process of the present invention can be used for gelatin with a water content preferably within a range of 5 to 25 . The lower limit is defined by the maximum processing temperature of 190 C, which in turn cannot be exceeded in order to avoid degradation. The upper limit is determined by the stickiness of the finished capsules. The abbreviations in Table 2 below will be used hereinafter in this application.

N N x m 2 The pressure of the hydrophilic polymer in the mold. PE N x m 2 The pressure in the nozzle area of the hydrophilic polymer.X The water content of the hydrophilic polymer, expressed as the weight fraction of the water hydrophilic polymer system. For the control and regulation of the injection molding process IMP we need the knowledge of the 1 heat consumption of the melting process B TE, PE H Ta, Pa 2 the heating rates of the hydrophilic polymers in the injection molding device. To calculate this we need the heat conduction number of the hydrophilic polymer and the heat transfer number of the hydrophilic polymer and the specific material of construction of the barrel which is in contact with the hydrophilic polymer. The heating rate and the heat consumption of the hydrophilic polymer give the minimum time interval necessary to make the hydrophilic polymer ready to inject and the necessary heating power of the injection molding device. 3 the TE depends on X of the hydrophilic polymers. If the water content of the hydrophilic polymer in the mold is too low the resulting TE will be too high and cause degradation. A minimum water content of 5 by weight is required to keep TE below 190 or. 4 the flow rate V 1T,P is as well strongly dependent on the water content of the hydrophilic polymer. To speed up the IMP we need a high flow rate which with can be achieved by a higher water content. The upper limit of the water content is defined by the stickiness and mechanical failure of the capsules a water content of 0.25 cannot be generally exceeded.The range within which capsules can be molded by the method of the present invention is therefore within 0.05 to 0.25 of water content. Better capsules are made with a water content in the range between 0.10 and 0.20 the best capsules were made with the water content in the range between 0.12 and 0.18. The hydrophilic polymer in the mold will reduce its volume due to the temperature change TM Ta. This would result in voids and diminution of size of the capsule, which therefore would be of unacceptable quality. It is an absolute requirement in capsule making that the dimensional deviations are less than 1 . To compensate for shrinking by the temperature change the mold must be filled at a distinct pressure PM. This filling pressure is determined by the quantities T,P and T,P . The injection pressure PE depends again on TE, which as was shown already is in turn strongly dependent on X. Referring now to Fig. 5, the shear rate dependent shear viscosity of gelatin at 900C is shown for gelatin with a water content X of 0.17. The capillary has a diameter of d 1.05 mm, and a length of 5.0 mm the ratio of length to diameter is therefore L d 4.75. Referring now to Fig. 6, the molding area diagram for gelatin with water content of 0.17. During injection molding the plasticized gelatin is discontinuously extruded and immediately cooled in a mold of the desired shape of the capsule part. Moldability depends on the gelatin properties and the process conditions, of which the thermomechanical properties of the gelatin as well as the geometry and the temperature and pressure conditions of the mold are the most important. In the molding area diagram of Fig. 6 the limits of pressure and temperature are indicated for the processing of gelatin in the combined injection molder microprocessor of the present invention. The maximum temperature of 1900C is determined by visible degradation of the gelatin above that limit.The lower temperature limit of 500C was determined by the development of too high viscosity and melt elasticity in the recommended water content range X 0.05 to 0.25. The higher pressure limits of 3x108 N x m 2 are given by the start of flashing when the melted gelatin flows in a gap between the various metal dies which make up the molds, thus creating thin webs attached to the molded gelatin capsule parts at the separating lines. The lower pressure limits of about 6x107 N x m 2 are determined by short shots, when the mold cannot be completely filled by the gelatin.

Such gelatin preparations are commonly called cold dryed gelatins.By rising the temperature of said gelatin preparation at a distinct water content the gelatin passes through the glass transition range. Referring to Fig. 1 said heating process of the gelatin will take place within the extruder barrel 17.Referring to Fig. 2 said heating process of the gelatin will take place during the entire injection molding work cycle. The area in Fig. 7 between the glass transition range and the melting range is called area II. In area lI we find crystalline gelatin and a gelatin melt. The glass transition is not a thermodynamic transition range of any order but is characterized by a change of the molecular movement of the gelatin molecules and by a change of the bulk storage module of the amorphous gelatin by several orders of magnitude. By passing from area II to area I in Fig. 7 the translational movements of the gelatin molecules or those of large parts of said molecules will be frozen in the glass transition temperature range and this is reflected by a change in the specific heat cp and the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient a in said temperature range. By passing from area II to area III due to crossing the melting range of the crystalline gelatin the helically ordered part of the gelatin will melt.Referring to Fig. 1 said heating process of the gelatin will take place within the extruder barrel 17. Referring to Fig. 2 said heating process of the gelatin will take place during the entire injection molding work cycle.Said helix coil transition is a true thermodynamic transition of the first order and is an endothermic process. Said transitions can be detected by scanning calorimetry or by measurement of the change of the linear viscoelastic bulk storage module due to change of the temperature. A typical plot of a temperature scan with a differential calorimeter is shown in Fig. 8.On the ordinate is plotted the velocity of the heat consumed by the sample relative to a reference empty sample holder . The velocity of heat consumption of the sample is due to the change of the temperature of the gelatin sample, and said temperature is plotted on the abscissa as degrees of kelvin. The base line shift on said plot is corresponding to the glass transition and the peak to the melting or to the helix coil transition. The linear viscoelastic bulk storage module E can be measured at small sinusoidal shear deformations of the gelatin sample. The changes of said module of a typical gelatin sample at water content X 0.13 is plotted as a function of the sample temperature in Fig. 9. At the glass transition temperature and at the melting or helix coil transition temperature said module changes several orders of magnitude.As is shown in Fig. 9 there exist a further transition temperature above the melting range, and said transition is characterized by a further drop in said module E. We will call the temperature of said transition the solution temperature. In the temperature range Tg to TM the gelatin is in the rubber elastic state, and the crystalline ranges or fibrills represent the elastically active elements of the network. Similar networks exist in the plasticized microcrystalline polyvinylchloride PVC . The crystalline regions give rise to diffraction patterns of x rays in said PVC but not in the gelatin I. Tomka, Chimia 30, 534 540 1976 I. Tomka et al Phot. Sci. 23, 97 1975 . In the temperature range TM to Ts the gelatin is in the viscoelastic rubber elastic state. The elastically active network in said state of the gelatin is like in most polymer melts a temporary network. Said temporary network is due to entanglements of the polymer molecules. Specifically in the gelatin the strong interactions between the macromolecules hydrogen bridges, dipol dipol interactions contribute an important part to the elastically active temporary network.At the solution temperature said temporary network disrupts and the gelatin molecules specifically due to the presence of water dissolve. At a temperature higher than Ts the storage module drops to extremely low values less than 10 x No 2, as shown in Fig. 9. In the present invention it was found that the processing injection molding, blow molding etc. of the gelatin should proceed at a temperature higher than Ts. Referring to Fig. 1 the heating of the gelatin to a temperature higher than TS takes place in the forward part of the extruder barrel 17. Said heating process will be maintained not only by the steam heating coils 18 but to an important proportion by the internal friction during the injection process due to the high deformational rates. Referring to Fig. 2 said dissolution process will take place especially between point A and B of the work cycle. It was found that the reversible elastic deformation of the injection molded gelatin after opening the mold 6 is negligible if the temperature of the gelatin during the injection process is higher than Ts, otherwise the molding sequence would drop by at least an order of magnitude. Referring to Fig. 2 the necessary cooling period for the gelatin in the molds to prevent any reversible elastic deformation of said gelatin will take place between points B and E of the working cycle. A restriction of the molding sequence to low speed coupled with long keeping of the gelatin in the mold larger than 5 sec is undesirable because of two reasons low output of the product and loss of water content of the gelatin in the extruder. At the elevated injection temperature there is always a transport of water from the hot to the cold gelatin in the extruder barrel. See D.Gehrmann, Thesis, University of Darmstadt 1979 . Said water transport can be compensated due to the transport of the gelatin by the screw in the opposite direction. Referring to Fig. I said transport of gelatin will be maintained by screw 8. Referring to Fig. 2 said transport of gelatin will take place between the pointsA and B and further between the points C and D of the working cycle. To build up a stationary water content of the gelatin in the melting area of the extruder barrel it is necessary to work at an injection sequence which is shorter than 5 sec. To establish a constant and high enough water content of the gelatin in the extruder barrel it is further necessary to use gelatin or other hydrophilic polymers with the proper shape of both the sorption isotherm see Fig. 10 and the differential heat of sorption as a function of the water content see Fig. 11 . The constant water content of the gelatin in the extruder barrel is necessary due to the maintenance of constant production conditions. The water content of the gelatin during the injection must fulfill the condition X higher than 0005 otherwise T5 is also higher than 1900C and this is undesirable due to degradation of the gelatin. The sorption isotherm of the gelatin shows an S shape with an inflection point at about 0.5 water activity monotonuously decreasing function of the differential heat of sorption with the water content.The condition which is necessary to avoid phase separation of the gelatin water phase into the two liquid phases gelatin water and water results in the extruder barrel during injection is as follows The water activity aWl of the gelatin at the highest temperature in the extruder barrel and for the water content range 0005 to 0.25 of the gelatin should be less than one By the present invention we could drop the processing temperature of a hydrophilic polymer by at least IOOOC which means we could shift the processing temperature Tp by incorporating sufficient water X is more than 0.05 and less than 0.25 during processing of said hydrophilic polymer leading to a range of the temperature 50 to 1900C where no degradation of said hydrophilic polymer during the processing takes place.The melting range of a typical gelatin with water content X is less than 0.002 which water content is common during the processing of polyamides which are in their chemical structure similar to the gelatin is between 220 and 250 C. This melting range is again comparable with the melting range of aliphatic polyamides. Polyamides for example show a different behaviour with respect to their compatibility with water during processing. The sorption isotherm of nylon 6 for example has no inflection point, its differential heat of sorption is not a monotonuously decreasing function with the water content and already at room temperature the sorption isotherm shows an equilibrium water activity value equal to a water content for 0.05.If we now incorporate about 0.035 water content in said polyamide at ambient temperature we will find already a phase separation of water and water polyamide phases below IOOOC. Because the nylon 6 polymer is not molten at the said water content and at temperatures below 1000C said polyamide is not processable. At a water content of 0.035 and temperatures equal to or higher than 1000C the said polyamide is again not processable due to the syneresis of water in the extruder and the mold. This effect is well known in the corresponding literature Kunststoff Bandbuch, Volume 6 Polyamide, Editors R. Viewegen, A. Muller, Karl Hanser Verlag, Munich, W. Germany 1966 . In the procedure of branching and crosslinking of hydrophilic polymers, preferably various types of gelatin, it is important to add the crosslinking agents, especially the covalent crosslinking agents, shortly before injection of the molten hydrophilic polymers. Referring now to Fig. 9 of the present invention it can be concluded that an increase of the molecular weight of said hydrophilic polymers would rise the solution temperature of said polymers. Due to possible degradation at elevated processing temperature it is not desirable to branch or crosslink said hydrophilic polymers before injection. Referring to Fig. 1, an aqueous solution of crosslinking agents is injected in front of a mixing system being placed between the melting and plasticizing unit 4 and the injection unit 1. The crosslinking reaction mainly occurs during the injection cycle and the time after ejection of the capsule. By the above described technology on branching and crosslinking there is no disadvantage of changing the thermomechanical properties of the hydrophilic polymers during the melting and solution process. The hydrophilic polymers preferably various types of gelatin are extruded and injected under the following conditions given in Table 3 below Table 3 Injection Conditions for Hydrophilic PolymersInjection UnitScrew diameter mn 24 28 32Injection pressure N x m 2 2.2x10 8 l.6x10 8 l.2x10 B calcuted swept volume on 3 38 51.7 67.5Effective screw length L D 18.8 16.1 13.5Plasticisirg capacity PS kg h max. la 13.5 21.2 21.5 lla 9.2 14.5 15 lb 23.6 34 36 11b 17.5 27 27.5Screw stroke mn max. 84 84 84Injection capacity kW 30 30 30Injection velocity mm s max. 460 4 60 460Nozzle contact force kN 41.2 4 1.2 41. 2 Screw rotating speed min l Var. la 20 280 lIa 20 170 Var.Ib 20 600 11b 20 400 number of beating zones 5 5 5Installed heating capacity kW 6.1 6.1 6.1Molding unit Clamping force kN 600Opening stroke mm 100 250 In addition to the present invention for molding capsules, one skilled in the art could also use this disclosure to produce capsules utilizing profile extrusion, compression molding, vacuum forming, thermal forming, extrusion molding, polymer casting in combination with vacuum forming.
