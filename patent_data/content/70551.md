# Method of manufacturing a gas sensor.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a gas sensor which is con structed of an electrically insulating base 1 , electrodes 2 formed on said base, and a gas sensitive film 3 formed on the surface of said base 1 at a portion where it detects the gas to be sensed, e.g. an oxygen gas. The gas sensitive film 3 is a thermal sprayed film made of an oxide having a perovskite structure. The thermal sprayed film has its surface formed with fine cracks to have its effective surface area increased so that the response is accelerated. Moreover, the ther mal spraying process is so effected during the forma tion of the oxide film 3 that impurities which might adversely affect the reliability may be avoided from being mixed. The gas sensor may have said gas sen sitive film 3 coated with a ceramic material 4 so that its performance may be further improved while protecting the gas sensitive film. Furthermore, it is also effective to add another sensor which uses the same electrically insulating base 1 .
