# Edge seal for a porous gas distribution plate of a fuel cell.

## Abstract
In an improved seal 48 for a gas distribution plate 18, 20 of a fuel cell, a groove 49 is provided extending along an edge 41 of the plate. A member of resinous material 50 is arranged within the groove and a paste 51 comprising an immobilized acid is arranged surrounding the member and substantially filling the groove. The seal, which is impervious to the gas being distributed, is resistant to deterioration by the electrolyte of the cell.
