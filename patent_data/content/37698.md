## Description
Benzaldehyde Derivatives for Use as a Chemical Intermdediate This invention relates to a novel benzaldehyde derivative which is useful as a chemical intermediate, to a process for its manufacture, and to processes for its conversion to valuable end products. More particularly the invention concerns the novel compound 4 4 chlorophenyl benzaldehyde, its production from 4 chlorobiphenyl and its conversion to 4 4 chlorophenyl benzyl alcohol and 4 4 chlorophenyl benzyl chloride which are themselves useful intermediates in the manufacture of known antiarthritic benzyloxyacetic acid derivatives. The production of various p substituted benzaldehyde derivatives is described in West German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2801887. However there is no mention of the production of the compound of formula I below. According to the invention there is provided the novel chemical intermediate of the formula EMI1.1 known as 4 4 chlorophenyl benzaldehyde, or the hydrate thereof. The invention further provides a process for the manufacture of the intermediate of formula I which comprises reacting 4 chlorobiphenyl with a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride optionally followed by conventional hydrate formation. It will be appreciated that this process is an example of the well known Gatterman Koch reactions reviewed by Olah and Kulin in Friedel Crafts and related reactions Vol. ISIS, p.1154 1162, InterscienceNew York, 1963 and may be carried out under the standard conditions well known in the art for that reaction. Accordingly, the process is generally carried out under a pressure in the range, for example, 70 to 250 bars and at a temperature in the range, for example, 20 to 50 C. Alternatively, the process may be carried out in the presence of cuprous chloride as a promoter or carrier in which case a reduced pressure in the range, for example, 1 to 5 bars and a temperature in the range, for example, 20 to 1000C. may be employed.In either case the process may conveniently be carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent or diluent, for example carbon disulphide, benzene, chlorobenzene or nitrobenzene. The hydrogen chloride and carbon monoxide may be provided from separate pressurised cylinders.Alternatively, they may be conveniently provided as an equi molar mixture by the reaction of chlorosulphonic acid with formic acid, or by the reaction of benzoyl chloride with formic acid. As a further alternative, the necessary hydrogen chloride may be produced in situ b,y tne reaction of aluminium chloride with water since less than stoichiometric quantities of hydrogen chloride may be used in the process and the carbon monoxide provided from an external pressurised cylinder. The invention also provides a further process for the manufacture of the intermediate of formula I or a hydrate thereof which comprises reacting 4 chlorobiphenyl with hexamethylenetetramine in the process of a strong acid optionally followed by hydrate formation. A particularly suitable strong acid is, for example, trifluoroacetic acid, which may also conveniently function as solvent for the process. The process is conveniently performed at a temperature in the range, for example, 20 1000C. The intermediate of formula I may be converted to the known chemical intermediate 4 4 chlorophenyl benzyl alcohol by a conventional reduction process, which process is provided as a further feature of the invention. Suitable reducing conditions are provided by, for example, alkali metal complex hydrides such as sodium or potassium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride, catalytic hydrogenation such as hydrogenation in the presence of palladium charcoal, sodium dithionite, and reducing metal systems, such as those based on iron, nickel or zinc. The reduction may be carried out under the standard conditions well known for the above mentioned reagents. Thus, in general, the reduction is carried out at a temperature in the range, for example, 20 to 1000C., and in the presence of a suitable solvent or diluent, for example water, ethanol, 2 propanol or acetic acid, or a mixture of two or more thereof it being understood that when lithium aluminium hydride is u as reducing agent, a non aqueous solvent or diluent, such as tetrahydrofuran must be used. The starting intermediate of formula I may conveniently be reduced in the above process immediately following its formation in the Gatterman Koch reaction and without being separately purified. In which case, no additional solvent need be added, but it is desirable to add a catalytic amount of a suitable quaternary ammonium salt such as cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as a phase transfer catalyst. 4 4 Chlorophenyl benzyl alcohol and the corresponding benzyl chloride are intermediates known for use in the synthesis of anti arthritic benzyloxyacetic acid derivatives a of tbe general formula EMI4.1 wherein Ra and Rb are independently hydrogen or l 4C alkyl radicals, and the base addition salts and simple esters thereof, and in particular of the compound wherein Ra and Rb are both methyl radicals UK patent specification Serial No 1,140,7481 and b , of the general formula EMI4.2 wherein Re is hydrogen or a l 4C alkyl radical, andRd is a phenyl radical optionally bearing a halogeno radical, and the base addition salts and simple esters thereof, and in particular of the compounds wherein Rc is a methyl or ethyl radical and Rd is a phenyl radical European patent application,publication No. 9306A1 . 4 4Chlorophenyl benzyl alcohol has hitherto only been obtained by hydrolysis of 4 4 chlorophenyl benzyl chloride which was itself obtained by reaction of 4 chlorobiphenyl with chloromethyl ethers UK patent specification Serial No. 1,140,748 . Although this latter procedure is satisfactory for small scale manufacture, it is unsuited to large scale manufacture except in expensive, specially built plant because of the difficulties associated with handling the potentially toxic chloromethyl ethers. Further, since 4 4 chlorophenylAbenzyl alcohol may be readily converted by redaction with conventional chlorinating or brominating agents well known in the art for example thionyl chloride, phosphorus tribromide or phosphoryl bromide1 into the corresponding benzyl chloride or bromide, the use of the intermediate of formula I also allows these latter compounds to be obtained if necessary on a large scale from 4 chlorobiphenyl without the use of hazardous chloromethyl ethers. The latter process is also provided as a feature of the. invention. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of a compound of the formula EMI5.1 wherein Re is hydrogen or a 1 4C alkyl radical., andRf is a l 4C alkyl radical or a phenyl radical optionally bearing a halogen radical, or a baseaddition salt or a 1 4C alkyl ester thereof which comprises carrying out the known steps of reacting a base addition salt of 4 4 chlorophenyl benzyl alcohol with a halogenated compound of the formula Hal.CReRf.C02Rg V wherein Re and Rf have the meanings defined above, Rg is hydrogen or a l 4C alkyl radical, and Hal. is a chloro, bromo or iodo radical, followed if necessary, by hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid, base addition salt formation or l 4C alkyl ester formation depending on the nature of Rg said process characterised in that the 4 4 chlorophenylAbenzyl alcohol is obtained by reduction of the intermediate of formula , for example using a procedure specified hereinbefore. The known steps in the above process are described in UR patent specificaiton Serial No.1,140,748, and European patent application, publicationNo. 9306A1 which documents are incorporated herein by reference. However, the necessary base addition salts of 4 C4 chlorophenyl benzyl alcohol are, for example, alkali metal salts such as the sodium or potassium salt and a preferred halogenated compound of formula V is, for example, ethyl 2 bromo 2 methylpropionate when the compound 2 4 4 chlorophenyl benzyloxy 2 methylpropionic acid, or a base addition salt thereof, is required as final product. The reaction with the halogenated compound of formula V may be carried out at a temperature in the range, for example, 20 1000C. and in a solvent or diluent, for example, chlorobenzene, toluene, xylene or dimethylformamide, or in a mixture of two or more thereof. Rg is preferably a methyl, ethyl orbutyl radical, and the necessary hydrolysis step in such a case is preferably carried out using an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide, for example aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide, at a temperature in the range, for example 20 to 1000C., and optionally in the presence of a solvent or diluent, for example ethanol, methanol or 2 propanol.The initially formed alkali metal salt may be converted to. the free acid by a conventional acidification procedure. The process is of particular value for the production of that compound of formula IV in which Re and Rf are both methyl radicals, or non toxic baseaddition salts thereof. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of a compound of the formula IV wherein Re andRf have the meanings defined above, or a base addition salt or a l 4C alkyl ester thereof which comprises carrying out the known steps of reacting 4 4 chlorophenyl benzyl chloride or bromide with a base addition salt of a compound of the formula HO. CReRf.CO2Rg VI wherein Re, Rf and Rg have the meanings defined above, followed if necessary, by hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid, base addition salt formation or 1 4C alkyl ester fbrmation, depending on the nature of Rg, said process characterised in that the 4 4 chlorophenyl benzyl chloride or bromide is obtained by reduction of the intermediate of formula I to give 4 4 chlorophenyl benzyl alcohol which is then reacted with a suitable chlorinating or brominating agent, for example using a procedure specified hereinbefore. The known steps in the above process are also described in UK patent specification Serial No.1,140,748 and European patent application, publicationNo. 9306A1. However, suitable base addition salts of the compounds of formula VI are, for example, alkali metal salts such as the sodium or potassium salts, and when Rg is hydrogen, di salts such as di alkali metal salts are preferred, The salts may conveniently be formed by reaction of the compound of formula VI with an appropriate base, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide or hydride, prior to the main process.The reaction of the 4 4 chlorophenylAbenzyl chloride or bromide with a base addition salt of a compound of formula VI may be generally carried out in a solvent or diluent, such as chlorobenzene, toluene, xylene or dimethylformamide, or in a mixture of two or more thereof, and at a temperature in the range, for example, 20 1500C., and more particularly, 60 1200C. Preferred compounds of formula VI are, for example, the ethyl esters of 2 hydroxy2 phenylpropionic acid, 2 hydroxy 2 phenylbutyric acid and 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropionic acid. Preferred values for Rg and suitable hydrolysis conditions are, for example, as described for the preceding process. The process is of particular value for the production of those compounds of formula IV wherein Re and Rf are both methyl radicals or Re is a methyl or ethyl radical and Rf is a phenyl radical, or a baseaddition salt thereof.
