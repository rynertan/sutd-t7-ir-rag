# ADDRESSING MATRIX

## Abstract
A method is described for configuring an instrument that may be comprised of masters M₁ and sub masters M₂ and slaves for each such that communication links can be established between each master or sub master and its slaves. The elements are assigned row and column addres ses in a grid in such manner that each master M₁ and sub master M₂ may determine the addresses of its slaves by scanning along rows or columns of the grid. A sub master M₂ may be a slave of a master M₁ and has its own area for its slaves. In the particular method described for attaining these results, slaves are at the same or a higher column address and at a higher row address than their master and any element at a higher column address but at the same or lower row address terminates the slave area at the previous column.
