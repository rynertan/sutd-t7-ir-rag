# GRAVITY INDEPENDENT INFUSION SYSTEM

## Abstract
An infusion system utilizing a pressurized source of infus ate comprises a capillary tube flow restrictor having sufficient length and suitably large ratio of length to internal diameter to provide reliably repeatable fluid resistance and minimum dam age to infusate. The internal diameter of the flow restrictor may be made to decrease with increasing temperature so that the flow rate of the infusate is substantially independent of temper ature. The flow restrictor may include means for indicating pressures and flow of infusate.
