# Automatic equalizing system with discrete Fourier transform DFT or fast Fourier transform FFT .

## Abstract
The equalizing arrangement in accordance with the in vention comprises an equalizing unit 4 for correcting the frequency characteristic of an electric signal applied to its first input 7 under the influence of a control signal 10 ap plied to its second input 8 and for supplying a corrected electric signal to its output 9 , and a frequency analyzing unit 16 having a first input 15 coupled to a point in the sig nal path between the input terminal 1 and the first input 7 of the equalizing unit 4 , a second input 17 coupled to the pick up means 14 and an output 19 for supplying the con trol signal 10 . The analyzing unit 16 is constructed to apply a Fourier transform to the previously digitized input signals x t and y t applied to its first and its second input, to compute Fou rier transformed signals F Preferably the frequency analyzing unit is further con structed to compute a coherence function γ²
