# Diagonal grid image communication and display.

## Abstract
A diagonal pel grid is used in a raster scanned CRT display. This is achieved by displacing alternate scan fields by a half pel in both axes to form a diagonal checkerboard grid that is interlaced in two axes. This substantially reduces the number of displayed pels to achieve a given quality as perceived by the human eye or substantially increases the apparent resolution of the image when the same number of pels are used as are used in a given rectangularly scanned application.
