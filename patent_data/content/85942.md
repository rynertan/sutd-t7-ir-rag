# Lighting system for building.

## Abstract
Lighting by the sunlight is available in every space in a building, even those spaces which have been hardly utilized such as the basement and ground water pit. The sunlight is collected and guided by optical cables 56 to light radiators 50, 54 which are located in intended spaces of a building. The basement 16 has a cistern 18 for water therein to afford a shelter in the case of emergency, while the ground water pit 20 which is also lighted by the conducted sunshine is usable to cultivate fish, plants, and other foodstuffs. The building 10 is annular except for its first floor A so that a cylindrical open space 12 is defined thereinside and also lighted by the sunlight, thereby intro ducing the sunlight even into the radially innermost spaces of the sunlight.
