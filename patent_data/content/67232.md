# DIGITALLY CONTROLLED SCREW THREAD CUTTING DEVICE.

## Abstract
A digitally controlled screw thread cutting device which can start cutting threads from an arbitrary position of rotation of the spindle. This device comprises thread cutting starting position indexing means for comparing the spindle rotational position detected by spindle rotational position detecting means with a predesignated rotational position to start cutting threads and starts feeding a cutter synchronized with the revolution of the spindle into a workpiece when the two positions of rotation coincide with one another. This device can thus cut special threads such as multiple screw threads and the like simply.

## Description
SPECIFICATION NUMERICAL CONTROLLED SCREW CUTTING DEVICE TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a numerical controlled screw cutting device which is capable of starting a screw cutting operation at any postion of rotation of a spindle. TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND In a conventional numerical controlled screw cutting device which cuts a screw in a workpiece by controlling the relative feed of a tool and the workpiece in synchronism with the rotation of a spindle, the screw cutting operation cannot be started except at a predetermined position of rotation of the spindle because a one turn signal that occurs at a specified position of rotation during one turn of the spindle is used as a screw cutting start signal to start the screw cutting operation.Consequently, for example in the case of cutting a multiple thread screw, it is necessary that the cutting start position of the tool be shifted previously, and it is difficult to perform such a special cutting operation, for instance, as shown in Fig. 1 in which the inclination of one portion of each slot sQ is reduced to zero or made different from the inclination of its other portions within one turn. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention is intended to overcome such a defect of the prior art and has for its object to make it possible to start the screw cutting operation at any position of rotation of the spindle. Briefly stated, the present invention is provided with means for detecting the position of rotation of a spindle and screw cutting start position indexing means for comparing the detected position of rotation of the spindle and a designated position of rotation of the spindle for starting a screw cutting operation and, in the case of coincidence, starting the relative feed of a tool and a workpiece synchronized with the rotation of the spindle. The means for detecting the position of rotation of the spindle comprises, for instance, a pulse generator mounted on the spindle and a counter for counting the number of output pulses from the pulse generatorSince screw cutting can be started at a desired position of rotation of the spindle, special screw cutting, such as multiple thread screw cutting, can easily be carried out. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a diagram explanatory of an example of special screw cutting Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the principal part of a device embodying the present invention and.Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram showing an example of a locus of movement of a tool. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the principal part of the device embodying the present invention. Reference numeral 1 indicates a workpiece, 2 a spindle, 3 a.spindle motor, 4 a pulse generator, 5 a numerical controller, 6 a counter, 7 an AND gate, 8 a decoder, 9 a pulse distribution circuit, 10 a screw cutting start position indexing circuit, 11 a Z axis servomotor, 12 a ball screw and 13 a tool. The workpiece 1 is mounted on the spindle 2 and driven by the spindle motor 3. To the spindle is coupled the pulse generator 4, which generates a plurality of snychronizing pulses NP per turn of the spindle and one one turn pulse 1P at a specified position of rotation during one turn of the spindle.The synchronizing pulses NP are applied to the counter 6 in the numerical controller 5 for integration and, at the same time, they are provided Via the AND gate 7 to the pulse distribution circuit 9. The counter 6 is reset by the one turn pulse 1P only once at the start of the screw cutting operation and since the number of synchronizing pulses necessary for one turn of the spindle is already known, the content of the counter 6 is indicative of the position of rotation of the spindle.Also it is possible to arrange the counter 6 so that is overflows with the synchronizing pulses NP of one turn and resumes the counting with its initial value. The pulse generator 4 and the counter 6 constitute means for detecting the position of rotation of the spindle. A command tape PT has stored therein pulse distribution data, such as the pitch of the screw to be cut, the distance of movement of the tool and so forth, and information on the position of rotation of the spindle which indicates the position of rotation of the spindle 2 at which the screw cutting operation is to be started. The decoder 8 decodes the command tape PT and generates distribution data. The pulse distribution data is provided to the pulse distribution circuit 9 and the information on the position of rotation of the spindle is applied to the screw cutting start position indexing circuit 10.The indexing circuit 10 compares the content of the counter 6 and the information on the designated position of rotation of the spindle for starting the screw cutting operation and, in the case of coincidence, opens the AND gate 7 to permit the passage therethrough of the snychronizing pulses NP for input into the pulse distribution circuit 9 and, at this timing, the screw cutting operation is started.That is to say, the pulse distribution circuit 9 is responsive to the snychronizing pulses NP to perform the pulse distribution operation namely, distribution pulses ZP are delivered to the Z axis servomotor 11 to rotate the ball screw 12 for feeding the tool 13 in a Z direction at a feed rate dependent on the lead of the screw and the revolving speed of the spindle and, after completion of cutting for a length L, an X axis servomotor, not shown, is driven by distribution pulses XP to move the tool 13 in a X direction, completing one screw cutting process. As described above, according to the device of this embodiment, the screw cutting operation can be started at an arbitrary position of rotation of the spindle, so that enven in the case of cutting multiple thread screw, there is no need of shifting the cutting start position of the tool 13 in the Z axis direction and it is sufficient only to command that the cutting start position be displaced through a predetermined angle from the position of rotation of the spindle at which the first screw cutting operation was started. Furthermore, such special screw cutting as shown in Fig. 1 can easily be carried out by commanding the screw cutting start position for each screw cutting command block as depicted in Fig. 3 which shows the locus of movement of the tool, the ordinate representing the position of the tool in the Z axis direction and the abscissa the angle of rotation of the spindle. In this embodiment, use is made of a detector with which it is not possible to detect the angle of rotation of the spindle, such as the pulse generator 4, but if an angle detector is used which is capable of directly outputting the angle of rotation of the spindle, such as a resolver, absolute encoder, or optical position detector, the counter 6 could be omitted. In this case, however, since the synchronizing pulses are not available from the detector, it is necessary to provide a detector for detecting the amount of rotation of the spindle per unit time from the detector output and to apply the detected output to the pulse distribution circuit 9. As has been described in the foregoing, according to the present invention, the position of rotation of the spindle is detected by the means for detecting the position of rotation of the spindle and when the detected position coincides with a designated position of rotation of the spindle for starting the screw cutting operation, the relative feed of the tool and the workpiece synchronized with the rotation of the spindle is started. Thus, since the screw cutting operation can be started at a desired position of rotation of the spindle, the present invention has the advantage that special screw cutting, such as multiple thread screw cutting or the like, can easily be effected.
