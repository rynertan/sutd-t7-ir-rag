## Abstract
Improvements in or relating to apparatus for forming a seal on a closure and to a closure having a seal formed from foamed adhesive material. Such an apparatus comprises means 12 for dispensing thermoplastic adhesive material onto the closure 14 as a foamed layer, means 13 for maintaining the foamed layer as a foam to form a seal 40 and means 19 for mixing the adhesive material with a gas to form a mixture which on dispensing evolves gas to form the foam. Such a closure 14 has a seal 40 formed from an adhesive foam, the foam being obtained by mixing thermoplastic adhesive material with a gas and dispensing the mixture onto the interior surface 37 of the closure 14 the mixture evolving gas to form the adhesive foam. The seal 40 formed has greater resilience and requires less material than a seal made of the same material in an unfoamed condition. The sealing material on the closure also requires no heating in order to be cured.
