# Cutter head for a suction dredger.

## Abstract
A cutter head for a suction dredger which includes a central boss 11 mountable upon a power drive shaft 12 and suction head or the dredger, wherein the boss 11 carries at least one spiral helical web 13 upon which is mounted an array of cutter bits 19 spaced at intervals along the web 13 and projecting therefrom so that their tips define a generally part ellipsoidal envelope 15 , the working direction of the bits 19 and the hand of the spiral helix of the web 13 being such that in use the cuts made by successive bits 19 on the same web 13 are staggered relatively to one another, each succeeding cut being nearer to the larger diameter end of the cutter head.

## Description
CUTTER HEAD FOR A SUCTION DREDGER This invention relates to cutter heads for floating suction dredgers. A conventional cutter head consists of 2 set of curved spiral helical blades mounted on an axial boss for rotation under power for the purpose of breaking up the sea or river bed, the broken fragments being romo from the head by suction and delivered to the dredger for disposal. When the sea bed consists of soft clay or sand, a typical dredger can operate at what is considered a satisfactory output rate, but when harder conglomerates, or rock are encountered, then the rate of removal decreases very significantly. For example, with a hard rock, having a compressive strength of 2000 3000 lb sq. in.the rate may be reduced by as much as 90 , though it would still be generally regarded as an acceptable rate of working. For harder rocks the rate is even lower until one reaches rock compressive strengths approaching 7,000 lbs sq. in., when othe methods, such as blasting, must be adopted, which sig ificantly increases the time and cost of the whole operation. Attempts have bcen made to adopt dry rock cutting t chniques, for example by fitting tecth or picke to cutter blades, but these have no been particularly successful due in part to a lack of understanding of the physical properties of underwater rock formations. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved cutter head for a suction dredger which is capable of operating on harder rocks than at present possible, or which can achieve a higher rate of removal than can be obtained at present for a given roc strength. The present invention consists in a cutter head for a suction dredger which includes a central boss mountable upon a power drive shaft and suction head of the dredger, wherein the boss carries at least one spiral helical web upon which is mounted an array of cutter bits spaced at intervals along the web and projecting therefrom so that their tips define a generally part ellipsoidal envelope, the working direction of the bits and the hand of the spiral helix of the web being such that in use the cuts made by successive bits on the same web are staggered relatively to one another each succeeding cut being nearer to the larger diameter end of the cutter head. In the accompanying av inOs Figure 1 is a side vie of one form of cutter head according to the present invention, Figure 2 is a longitudinal section through the cutter head on Figure X, and Figure 3 is a cross section taken in a spiral plane starting at line 3 3 of Figure 1. In carrying the invention into effect according to one convenient mode by va of example, a cutter head for a suction dredger includes a central boss 11 adapted to be fitted on the drive S ft 12 of suction head of known form of a suction dredger. Welded to the central boss are four interposed closely spaced pairs of spiral helical webs 13 of metal sheet or plate material thus forming a four start spiral helical channel system, between adjacent pairs of web pairs, each channel being of about 1 turns.At the larger diameter end the webs 13 are joined to a pair of annular rings 14 positioned coaxially with the axis of the boss 11 and at right angles thereto. At the smaller diameter end the webs 13 are joined to a pair of conical rings 23 positioned coaxially with the axis of the boss, and whose included angle is about 60 . The webs 13 are so dimensioned that in longitudinal profile they define a curve 15 which is part of a near ellipse and is chosen so as to present the optimum angle of attack to the sea bed whatever the angle of the axis of the cutter to the horizontal in use. rThe peripheries of the webs and the annular rings are provided with cut outs 16 in which are welded mounting plates 17 each of which bridges the pair of webs or ri gs and upon which is mounted a block 18 holding a cutter bit 19 so that an array of cutter bits 19 is formed. The cut outs are so dimensioned that the tips of the cutter bits 19 project beyond the peripheries of the webs, the extent to which they project defining the maximum cutting depth of the bits, and the bits are angled in conventional manner as shown in figure 3 so as to have a working direction clockwise in figure 3 . Trie tips of the cutter bits thus define a generally part ellipsoidal envelope of the same form as curve 15.The cutter bits 19 are spaced at intervals around the pairs of webs 13 are the working direction of the bits 19 and the hand of the spiral helix of the webs are such thot in use the cuts made by successive bits on the same web are sta g red relatively to on another each succeeding cut being nearer to the larger diameter end of the cutter head. The pairs of webs 13 are Tiovided with apertures 20 to prevent bridging of material between adjacent pairs, and to allow the rearward flow of material to the mouth 21 of the suction head under the action of the suction from the head assisted by the helicel form of the webs 13. T assist this action sco ps 22 are provided between adjacent pairs of scoops 22, but other arrangements may be advantageous. Various modifications nay be made within the scope f the preset invention. For example, the cutter bits may be replaced by other fcrms of mining tools such as picks or chisels.
