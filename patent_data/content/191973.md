# An insulating module.

## Abstract
A block shaped insulating module 20 for use in insulat ing the interior of a high temperature furnace or the like comprises a plurality of short, ropelike lengths formed of braided strands, assembled in side by side relation to form a bundle. The strands are formed of twisted, generally parallel ceramic fibers spun into cords and assembled or braided into a rope, which is then cut into generally equal lengths. The lengths are retained in a tightly compacted condition where by the ends of the fibers define a front planar face 24 of the module, with the fibers being aligned in a generally perpen dicular orientation relative to the front planar face.
