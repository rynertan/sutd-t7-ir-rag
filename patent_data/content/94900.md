# Succinic anhydride derivatives as a scorch inhibitor for carboxylated rubbers.

## Abstract
Scorch the premature cross linking of an elastomer is a problem that is often encountered in carboxylated rubbers. Succinic anhydride derivatives alkenyl succinic anhydrides, alkyl succinic anhydrides, and their corresponding dicar boxylic acids can be used to greatly improve the scorch resistance of carboxylated rubbers. These succinic anhydride derivatives can be distributed through a carboxylated rubber before or after coagulation using any procedure that will result in a thorough mixing to form a rubber composition with improved scorch resistance.
