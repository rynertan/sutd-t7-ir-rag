# Combinatorial weighing apparatus.

## Abstract
A distributive supply device, coupled to a vibration generator 8 , for distributing articles c to a plurality of receptacles 7 associated with respective different weighing machines, comprises a supply container 21 provided with a plurality of tubular outlet chutes 3 leading from the supply container at respective substantially peripheral outlet points thereof and arranged to discharge respectively with the said receptacles 7 . Such a device can be used in a combinatorial weighing apparatus to improve flow control when batching finely divided materials.
