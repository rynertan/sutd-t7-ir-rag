# Glass composition for binding and filling ceramic parts.

## Abstract
The glass composition is particularly applicable for ferrite constituents used for a highly efficient magnetic head. The composition essentially consists of a 55 70 wt of V₂O₅, b 18 25 wt of P₂O₅, c1 up to 10 wt of at least one alka line metal oxide selected from Na₂O, K₂O, Rb₂O, and Cs₂O and c3 up to 10 wt of Tl₂O. The composition is in a non crystaline state during reheating and has a softening tempera ture of 310 C 400 C and a thermal expansion coefficient of 70 130
