# Zeolite Nu 3.

## Abstract
A new zeolite material designated NU 3 having a molar composition expressed by the formula 0.5 to 1.5 R₂O Y₂O₃ at least 5 XO₂ 0 to 400 H₂O wherein R is a monovalent cation or 1 n of a cation of valency n where n is a whole number of 2 or more, X is silicon and or germanium, Y is one or more of aluminium, iron or gallium and H₂O is water of hydration additional to water notionally present when R is H, and having an X ray diffraction pattern substantially as shown in Table 1, is prepared from a reaction mixture containing XO₂ preferably silica , Y₂O₃ preferably alumina and an optionally substituted quinuclidinium ion.
