# Sunflower regeneration through embryogenesis and organogenesis.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to the regeneration of sunflowers via embryogenesis and organogenesis. The process comprises the steps of a culturing tissue obtained from a sunflower plant on a first medium which comprises mineral salts, vitamins, amino acids, sucrose and a hormone in an amount sufficient to ensure callus formation b optionally subculturing said callus on a maintenance medium which comprises mineral salts, vitamins, amino acids, sucrose and a hormone in an amount sufficient for callus maintenance c subculturing said callus on a second medium which comprises mineral salts, vitamins, amino acids, sucrose and a hormone in an amount sufficient to precondition the callus c subculturing said callus on a third medium which comprises mineral salts, vitamins, sucrose and a hormone in an amount sufficient to ensure shoot formation, and d subculturing said shoot on a fourth medium which comprises mineral salts, vitamins, sucrose and a hormone in an amount sufficient to ensure root formation, whereby plants are obtained.
