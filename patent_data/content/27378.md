## Description
condensates provide somewhat better properties in the cured films, but these are far more expensive, and this disadvantage grows greater as the proportion of use increases. It has also been proposed to incorporate N methylol functional reactive groups in the amine copolymer so as to provide a self curing cationic copolymer. This would then deem unnecessary the use of a curing coreactant such as the aminoplast resins normally used. Despite the obvious simplification and economy provided through the use of self curing resins, these self curing cationic systems have not been successful possibly because it has been difficult to combine the curing reactivity and bath stability which is needed to enable such a system to be successful. Examples of prior efforts using self curing copolymers are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,446,723, 3,454,482, 3,455,806 and 3,458,420. It is stressed that high degrees of N methylol functionality are required to cure the low molecular weight copolymers to the point where they possess good properties. On the other hand, the higher the degree of N methylol functionality, the greater the tendency for undesirable prereaction during copolymerisation and storage in the aqueous acidic medium of the electrocoating bath.Furthermore if etherification is used to stabilise the N methylol functional groups and prevent their prereaction, then these ether groups tend either to hydrolyse in the aqueous medium to cause prereaction, or the hydrolysis COATING COMPOSITION FOR CATIONIC ELECTROCOATING FROM AQUEOUS BATH AND BATH FOR SAMETECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a coating composition for cationic electrocoating from an aqueous bath comprising a cationic amine functional copolymer mixture and an aminoplast resin1 for example, one in which the copolymer is a solution copolymer of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers the amino grips of which are rendered cationic and water dispersible by a neutralisation of up to about 90 by a solubulising acid, and the resin comprises from 5 56 to 30 based on the weight of the copolymer.BACKGROUND ART Amine functional copolymers which have been rendered cationic and water dispersible by neutralisation with a solubilising acid are known. The dispersed resin particles migrate to the cathode when a uni directional electrical current is passed through the aqueous medium which contains the resin particles and these particles deposit upon the cathode to form a coating. The coated cathode is removed from the electrocoating bath and then baked to cure the coating. Generally, the amine functional copolymer contains reactive groups, such as hydroxy groups, and an aminoplast resin curing agent is incorporated in the bath for codeposition with the reactive amine copolymer. The aminoplast resin cross links the copolymer when the coating is baked. Melamineformaldehyde condensates have been used, but the corrosion resistance and detergent resistance have not been fully satisfactory. Benzoguanamine formaldehyde resistant ether groups tend to prevent or reduce water dispersibility. It is an object of the present invention to provide a coating composition which does not suffer from the above disadvantages but which can yield a corrosion and detergent resistant coating.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION According to the invention, a coating composition for cationic electrocoating from an aqueous bath is characterised in that the copolymer comprises from 3 to 35 of a monomer having a basic amino group, from 20 to 35 of isobutoxymethyl acrylamide or methacrylamide, and 0 up to 15 of a monomer providing active hydrogen atoms coreactive with N methylol functionality, the proportions being based on the weight of the copolymer, the balance of the copolymer comprising nonreactive monomers, and in that a water miscible organic solvent is employed to aid the solubilising acid. Preferably the basic amino group of the unsaturated monomer contains from 3 to 20 carbon atoms. Preferably the monomer providing active hydrogen atoms coreactive with N methylol functionality comprises from 1 to 10 of the copolymer. The copolymer may be used in admixture with from 5 30 of the weight of the copolymer of an aminoplast resin, or bisphenolformaldehyde condensate. The term nonreactive denotes the absence of functional groups, other than the single polymerisable unsaturated group, which will react under the contemplatÃ«d conditions of polymerisation and cure.Normally, this means that no other functional group is present. Suitable nonreactive monomers are for example styrene, vinyl toluene, C C8 alkyl esters of monoethylenic acids, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, and the like. Preferably, styrene and or vinyl toluene is combined with 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate in amounts providing from 20 45 of styrene and or vinyl toluene to from 25 405 of 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate. The use of such a proportion of 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate may improve the hydrolytic stability of the bath and may help to allow the use of less than 35 isobutoxymethyl acrylamide while outstanding corrosion resistance may still be achieved. It is surprising to be able to use such large amounts of long chain esters and ethers in a stable aqueous dispersion. The amine functional monomers which may be used are known in themselves and are preferably amino alkyl derivatives of a monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or an amide thereof. Dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate is suitable, but any monoethylenically unsaturated copolymerisable amine, be it primary, secondary or tertiary, may be used, however, the tertiary amines are preferred. Other suitable amine monomers are for example dimethyl aminopropyl methacrylate, monomethyl aminoethyl methacrylate, aminoethyl methacrylate, and the corresponding acrylates, crotonates and the like. The amino amides are particularly preferred, for example dimethyl aminopropyl methacrylamide. The proportion of the amine monomer in the copolymer may be varied considerably, but a proportion of from 10 to 25 based on the weight of the copolymer is preferable. Among the reactive monomers which may be present, preferably in an amount of from 1 to 10 , are amides, such as acrylamide, and hydroxy monomers, such as hydroxy alkyl acrylates and methacrylates in which the alkyl group normally contains from 2 4 carbon atoms. Preferably, the reactive monomer comprises a monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, such as acrylic acid, crotonic acid, itaconic acid, or methacrylic acid. Alternatively, fumaric acid or monoethyl fumarate may be used. The curing process involves the removal of alcohol in a condensation reaction which thus consumes a large number of N methylol groups. This condensation reaction may be catalysed by the presence of acid, but the acid groups used for solubilisation may be removed by the electrophoretic action which caused cationic electrodeposition. The presence of the carbbxyl groups in the copolymer may catalyse this cure. At the same time, most of the acidity may be eliminated by the cure because of the high degree ofN methylol functionality which is present to consume the relatively small proportion of carboxyl functionality. With ethers having less than four carbon atoms present in the isobutoxy ether, hydrolysis in the acidic electrocoating bath tends to provide N methylol groups which tend to react slowly and may change the characteristics of the bath. The more N methylol groups, the more the bath tends to change with time.On the other hand, other ether groups which may resist hydrolysis because they contain more than four carbon atoms may not be useful because these longer groups tend to be hydrophobic and may prevent satisfactory dispersion of the amine functional copolymer with the aid of an acid. Thus more acid may be required and the bath pH may fall below 5.0 which creates corrosive conditions. Thus preferably, the bath pH is in the range of 6.0 to 7.0. While the copolymer may consist essentially of monoethlenically unsaturated materials, polyethylenically unsaturated copolymerisable materials may also be present so long as they do not prevent the achievement of a solvent soluble, nongelled copolymer. The copolymerisation in organic solvent solution may be carried out in conventional fashion using a water miscible organic solvent, moderate heat, and a free radical generating polymerisation catalyst such as azobisisobutyronitrile, benzo peroxide or cumene hydroperoxide. While chain termination using agents such as alkyl mercaptans can be used, such agents are preferably absent since the amine monomer is itself an inhibitor of the desired copolymerisation. Preferably, the best copolymers are made slowly adding the materials to be copolymerised to a heel of the solvent containing a stoichiometric deficiency of the solubilising acid. This technique of providing the amine copolymer in partial salt form is described in the present Applicants copending U.S.Application No. 14,101 filed Feb. 22, 1979. This incremental addition process is used in the example below, however, while it is preferable, it is not essential to the present invention. Preferably, the acids for solubilising the amine copolymers are organic acids, such as acetic acid, glycollic acid, and, most preferably, dimethylol propionic acid. However, inorganic acids which do not damage the deposited film, such as phosphoric acid, may also be used. Acids which vaporise or decompose are most preferred since it is generally not preferable to have the solubilising acid present in the final cured coating. Neutralisation is preferably between 25 to 70 , including the acid which forms part of the copolymer. The curing resin comprises preferably from 10 20 of the weight of the copolymer. The resins may be, for example benzoguanamine formaldehyde or bisphenol formaldehyde condensates. The invention also extends to a coating composition in accordance with the invention as a stable dispersion in water to provide an electrodeposition bath.BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The invention may be illustrated by the following example Example Grams Component 321 2 butoxy ethanol 40 Dimethylol propionic acid to neutralise amino monomer to about 50D The above are charged to a reactor and heated to 95 0C to form a heel of solution in which the polymerisation is carried out.145 Isobutoxymethyl acrylamide 218 Styrene 191 2 ethyl hexyl methacrylate 105 Dimethyl aminopropyl methacrylamide 12 Azobisisobutyronitrile The above are premixed and added to the heel of acid containing solvent slowly over a 3 hour period while maintaining the temperature at gOOC. When this addition is finished, most of the polymerisation has been completed. To insure completion of reaction, 2 grams of azobisisobutyronitrile is added and the temperature is maintained at 900 C for one hour, and this procedure is repeated one more time, at which point the conversion of monomer to polymer is complete. 15 by weight of benzoguamine formaldehyde resin X1 1123 from American Cyamanide is added and then sufficient deionised water is added with rapid agitation to provide an aqueous bath which is a milky dispersion having a solids content of about 28 and having a pH of about 6.5. Electrodeposition at the cathode after dilution with deionised water to 10h solids content proceeds well at 75 volts. The coated cathode is removed from the bath and cured by baking in an oven having a temperature of 3500F 1770C or higher, the lower the baking temperature, the longer the time needed for cure. 4000F to 4500F 2040C to 232 C for 30 to 15 minutes is a typical curing schedule. In this example coated panels were baked for 20 minutes at 4000F 2040C and had excellent methyl ethyl ketone resistance and corrosion resistance. The bath was stable and retained its desirable characteristics on prolonged use.
