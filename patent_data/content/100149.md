# Diaphragm pumps.

## Abstract
A diaphragm pump is disclosed which includes flow channels 12 12a within pressure chambers 9 9a , at least one of the walls defining the flow channels being in the form of a diaphragm wall 16, 17 16a, 17a . A driven piston A B displaces a liquid within the pressure chambers 9 9a to cause cyclical changes in the volume of and pressure sub sisting within the flow channels. Compensating pistons S T are disposed generally opposite each of the driven pis tons A B and the compensating pistons are connected to a common hydraulic circuit such that the compensating pis tons remain in position until the pressure in one of the pres sure chambers 9 9a exceeds a predetermined pressure, whereupon the compensating pistons S T react in a man ner tending to prevent further rise in the pressure in that chamber.
