# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SEALING WELDED SEAMS OF AUTOMOBILES

## Abstract
The invention relates to a system for applying sealant material to the welded seams of an automobile body. The apparatus of the invention includes a reciprocating piston pump 14 for supplying the material under pressure from a reservoir 18 to an overhead distribution manifold 20 . From the manifold the material is supplied to a plurality of extrusion guns 24 through drop lines 22 , each of which includes a pressure regulator 29 and volumetric metering gear pump 30 for maintaining a constant flow rate to the guns irrespective of pressure changes which may occur in the distribution manifold.
