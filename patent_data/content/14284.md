# Method of adhesion of rubber to reinforcing materials and composition therefor.

## Abstract
A vulcanizable rubber composition comprises A natural or synthetic rubber, or a mixture thereof B a vulcanizing agent and C from about 1 to 10 parts by weight, per hundred parts by weight of rubber, of a glyoxal, b a reaction product of glyoxal and from 0.1 to 10 molar proportions of urea and c a reaction product of glyoxal, 0.1 to 10 molar proportions of urea and from 0.01 to 2 molar proportions of formaldehyde per molar proportion of glyoxal. The composition provides excellent adhesion of rubber to reinforcing materials such as textile and steel wires.
