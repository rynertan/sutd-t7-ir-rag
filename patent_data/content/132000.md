# Method of operating a bimodal heat pump and heat pump for operation by this method.

## Abstract
A method of operating a bimodal heat pump in a first mode and a second mode by heating an auxiliary medium 43 in a heat boiler 41 arranged separately from the heat pump, whereby the heat pump operates as an absorption heat pump in the first mode, in which the condensation heat of the auxili ary medium 43 is transferred to a solution 35 of working medium in a solvent in a generator 1 by means of a first heat exchanger 37 , while in the second mode the absorption heat pump is made inoperative and the condensation heat of the auxiliary medium 43 is transferred to a heat transporting medium by means of a second heat exchanger 69 which is included in a system of pipes 53 for the heat transporting medium and is arranged in the heat boiler 41 . The method is particularly intended to be used for room heating both at a comparatively high ambient temperature in the first mode and at a comparatively low ambient tempera ture in the second mode.
