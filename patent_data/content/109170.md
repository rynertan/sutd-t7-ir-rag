# Improvements in casting aluminium alloys.

## Abstract
In the casting of ingots 9 of aluminum alloys, contain ing a readily oxidisable component, in an openended mould 2 , a space is enclosed over the molten metal surface adja cent the mould wall and is filled with an inert gas. The en closure is maintained by a baffle 4 which dips into the mol ten metal surface close to the baffle. The molten metal sur face between the baffle and the mould wall is preferably covered by a layer of an oxide dissolving flux, which cleanses the mould wall at the metal meniscus mould wall interface.
