# Light receiving member.

## Abstract
A light receiving member comprises a substrate having a large number of projection parts, whose cross sectional shape at a given Cross sectional position is a projection shape formed of a main peak and an auxiliary peak as overlapped, on the surface of the substrate, and a light receiving layer comprising a layer containing an amorphous material including silicon atoms, at least one part of the layer region of the layer being photosensitive, and a surface layer having a reflection preventive function. An electrophotographic system comprises the above mentioned light receiving member.
