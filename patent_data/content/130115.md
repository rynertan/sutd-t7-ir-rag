# Polycarbonate latex compositions.

## Abstract
Latex compositions containing a polycarbonate compris ing 0.1 to 30 mole percent of recurring units having a carboxyl or a tertiary amine acid addition salt component are disclosed. The latex compositions can be made by a preparing a polycarbonate comprising from 0.1 to 30 mole percent of recurring units having a carboxyl or a tertiary amine acid addition component b dissolving the polycarbonate in a water miscible sol vent having a boiling point below 100 C c blending the solution of b with water and d removing the water miscible solvent.
