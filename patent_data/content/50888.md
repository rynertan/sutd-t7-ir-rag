# Suspension means for a rail vehicle disc brake unit.

## Abstract
Suspension means for a rail vehicle disc brake unit 1 comprises a suspension console 11 to be attached to a vehicle bogie or underframe, a cradle 13 movably attached to the console, and suspension links 17, 18 pivotally connecting the brake pad holders 6 to the cradle. A further supporting connection 19 21 is provided between the console and the brake unit. In order to obtain the desired mobility for the brake disc during braking, there is a joint 14 , between the console 11 and the cradle 13 , which is stiff in the brake force transmission direction but comparatively resilient in other directions. The supporting connection 19 21 has basically the same properties.
