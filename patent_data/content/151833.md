## Description
METHOD OF INCREASING HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION BY REMEDIAL WELL TREATMENT The present invention relates to a method of increasing hydrocarbon production from a subterranean formation having impaired permeability as the result of well drilling or prior stimulation treatments. Various procedures have been developed and utilized heretofore to increase the flow of hydrocarbons from hydrocarboncontaining subterranean formations penetrated by well bores. For example, a commonly used production stimulation technique involves creating and extending fractures in the subterranean formation to provide flow channels therein through which hydrocarbons flow from the formation to the well bore. The fractures are created by introducing a fracturing fluid into the formation at a flow rate which eXerts a sufficient pressure on the formation to create and extend fractures therein.Solid fracture proppant materials, such as sand, are commonly suspended in the fracturing fluid so that upon introducing the fracturing fluid into the formation and creating and extending fractures therein, the proppant material is carried into the fractures and deposited therein whereby the fractures are prevented from closing due to subterranean forces when the introduction of the fracturing fluid has ceased. In such formation fracturing and other production stimulation procedures, at least a portion of the stimulation fluid or fracturing fluid will leak off into the formation and will reduce the relative permeability of the invaded region of the formation.After fluid injection has ceased, imbibition will begin to alter the fluid distribution within the formation, and when production begins, the fluid will move from the formation into the fracture.It is important to leave the formation after treatment with the maximum permability or conductivity possible whereby hydrocarbons contained in the formation will flow to the well bore with the least possible restriction. However, substantially all stimulation fluids or fracturing fluids, no matter how carefully they are selected, will do some damage to the formation adjacent to the fracture. In order to achieve maximum conductivity of hydrocarbons from subterranean formations, whether or not such formations have been fractured or otherwise stimulated, it has heretofore been the practice to cause the formation surfaces to remain water wet after treatment.Such water wetting has been shown to provide an improved flow of hydrocarbons through flow channels and capillaries in the magnitude of about three times greater than when the formation surfaces are hydrocarbon wet. The water wetting of solid surfaces in subterranean hydrocarbon containing formations as well as the surfaces of solid proppant material deposited therein has heretofore been accomplished using surfactants in the stimulation fluids or fracturing fluids whereby a layer of water or water and surfactant is spread over the solid surfaces. Such layers of water or water and surfactant are extremely viscous near the interface of the layer. and the solid surface, and while the layer provides a slippage or lubricating effect at the interface thereof with hydrocarbons which decreases the resistance to flow, the layer reduces the effective diameter of capillaries and flow channels. This reduction of effective diameter restricts fluid flow, and in very small sapillaries or flow channels becomes highly significant. If the formation relative permeability has been damaged by the invasion of the stimulation fluid or fracturing fluid into the formation and this damage results in an increase in the capillary pressure in the damaged region, the capillary pressure in the damaged region then acts as a pressure sink drawing additional water to the damaged region. Unless the pressure drawdown upon attempting production is large enough to overcome the increased capillary pressure, a complete blocking of the formation in the damaged region will occur. Even when the pressure drawdown is sufficient to overcome the capillary pressure, production can be reduced because of the decrease in the capillary radius of the flow channels caused by the layer of water coating the solid surfaces in the formation. By the present invention, methods are provided whereby certain fluids are employed to strip water or other aqueous fluids from the formation solids and certain compounds then are caused to be adsorbed onto the solid surfaces in the subterranean hydrocarbon containing formations in a very thin layer, i.e. a layer which is preferably one molecule thick and significantly thinner than a layer of water or a water surfactant mixture. The compounds so adsorbed on the surfaces resist or substantially reduce the wetting of the surfaces by water and hydrocarbons, and provide high interfacial tensions between the surfaces and water and hydrocarbons which allows slippage of hydrocarbons at the hydrocarbon surface interface and significantly increases the flow of hydrocarbons through capillaries or flow channels in the formations. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of increasing the production of hydrocarbons from a hydrocarbon containing subterranean formation having impaired permeability as a result of formation invasion by aqueous fluids, which method comprises contacting said formation with a penetrating solvent capable of disrupting at least a portion of any aqueous layer present on solid surfaces within said formation, and at least one cationic perfluoro compound whereby said compound is adsorbed onto said solid surfaces of said formation said cationic perfluoro compound s being of the formula EMI4.1 wherein x is an integer from 2 to 12 or an integer or fractional integer representing an average value of from 2 to 12 w and y are both individually integers from 0 to 20 or integers or fractional integers representing average values of from 0 to 26 z is an integer from 0 to 20 or an integer or fractional integer representing an average value of from 0 to 20, the sum of y and z being from 1 to 20 R is a hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl radical, or mixtures thereof A is chlorine, bromine or iodine andQ is a cationic nitrogen radical selected from an aromatic amino radical, a heterocyclic amino radical, and an amine radical represented b the formula EMI5.1 wherein R1, 2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrocarbon radicals containing from 1 to 30 carbon atoms, aromatic hydrocarbon radicals such as phenyl and any alkyl substituted phenyl radical, and hydrogen radicals, provided that at least one of 1 R2 and R3 is an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to 30 carbon atoms or an aromatic hydrocarbon and that, when any one of R1, R2 and radicals contains more than four aliphatic carbon atoms or an aromatic hydrocarbon, the other two radicals are each chosen from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl and ethyl radicals.

In carrying out the methods of the present invention to improve the productivity of a subterranean formation having impaired permeability, the penetrating solvent is introduced into the formation by pumping down a well bore penetrating the subterranean formation. The penetrating solvent disrupts the water or other aqueous fluid layer coating upon the solid surfaces in the subterranean formation, including the surfaces of any proppant material that may be present, to permit contacting with the cationic perfluoro compound or compounds. The cationic perfluoo compound or compounds can be applied directly to a subterranean formation whereby the surfaces thereof are contacted by the compounds and adsorbed thereon.However, preferably, the cationic perfluoro compound or compounds utilized are dissolved or dispersed in a carrier fluid which is in turn introduced into the formation through the well bore penetrating the same whereby the carried cationic perfluoro compounds are distributed in the formation and contact solid surfaces therein whereby they are adsorbed thereon. Aqueous or hydrocarbon base carrier fluids can be utilized in the form of liquids, foams, emulsions, etc. The particular quantity of perfluoro compounds combined with the carrier fluid can vary widely depending upon the type of formation to be treated and other factors, but generally the cationic perfluoro compounds utilized are combined with the carrier fluid in an amount in the range of from about 0.01 to about 10 by weight of the carrier fluid. Particularly preferred carrier fluids are 50 alcohol foams. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the penetrating solvent employed to disrupt the water or aqueous fluid coating and the carrier fluid are the same fluids. In this instance, the penetrating solvent and cationic perfluoro compound or compounds are introduced together such that as the solvent disrupts the water coating the cationic perfluoro compound or compounds contact the water free solid surfaces and are adsorbed thereon such that the solid surfaces now remain substantially non wettable by water or hydrocarbons. When a proppant material has been placed in fractures formed in the subterranean formation by prior stimulation treatments, the penetrating solvent also disrupts the water coating on this material and the cationic perfluoro compound or compounds are adsorbed thereon.Thus, both the surfaces of the formation and the surfaces of the proppant material have cationic perfluoro compounds adsorbed thereon whereby such surfaces are substantially prevented from being wetted by water or hydrocarbons and the flow of hydrocarbons through the formation and proppant material is significantly increased. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of the methods of the present invention, and not by way of limitation, the following examples are provided.

In runs in which the sand is treated with cationic perfluoro compounds Table I above , the time required to displace the water in the sand pack is less than four minutes, and subsequent oil flow rates are in the range of 2 to 5 ml. min., depending on the particular structure of the cationic perfluoro compound. The greater the sustained flow rate of oil following water, the more pronounced is the non wetting effect of the sample.
