## Abstract
Novel acrylonitrile butadiene and carboxylated acrylo nitrile butadiene elastomeric admixtures compounded with various amounts of mineral fillers such as silicates, silicas, etc., carbon blacks, and plasticizers such as esters, epoxi dized polyesters, etc., are useful as continuous temperature sensitive solids when applied to metallic conductors as coatings whereby one leg acts as a conductor and the other is used as the sensing leg. These electrical properties of these admixtures such as volume resistivity, impedance, and reactance are uniquely sensitive to temperature changes from room temperature to at least 90 C and thus offer new and important circuit design opportunities for monitoring and detecting temperature changes. These admixtures which are essentially thermosetting may be combined with other resins such as polyvinyl chloride and used thermoplas tically. In these cases, the elastomer becomes the plasticizer.
