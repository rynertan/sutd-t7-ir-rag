# A process and catalyst composition for upgrading a hydrocarbon feedstock.

## Abstract
In a dual bed hydrotreating hydrocracking process for upgrading a hydrocarbon feedstock, the feedstock is first passed through a conventional hydrotreating catalyst sys tem. Thereafter the effluent is passed in contact with a catalyst composition comprising a mixture of an ultra stable Zeolite Y and a crystalline zeolite of the ZSM 5 type under conditions suitable to effect cracking and hydrodewaxing of hydrocarbons in the product stream.
