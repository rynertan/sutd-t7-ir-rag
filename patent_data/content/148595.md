# METHOD OF FABRICATING MESA MOSFET USING OVERHANG MASK AND RESULTING STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A mesa structure field effect transistor includes a semicon ductor body with at least one mesa formed on a major surface and an insulating layer on the mesa and overhanging the mesa. Doped regions in the side walls of the mesa define the channel region and source of the transistor, and the semiconductor body defines the drain region. Preferential etching techniques are employed in forming the mesas and the overhanging insulator. The overhanging insulator is employed as a shadow mask in fabricating the transistor.
