## Description
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF AN AROMATIC HYDROCARBON MIXTURE The invention relates to a process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture from methanol. Aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures are widely used as gasoline. As a rule they are obtained by catalytic reforming of petroleum based aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures which boil in the gasoline range. An investigation by the Applicant into the preparation of aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures from aliphatic compounds has shown that certain crystalline silicates recently synthesized for first time by the Applicant are suitable for use as catalysts for the preparation of aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures from methanol. By contacting methanol at elevated temperature with a catalyst containing one of these crystalline silicates, an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture boiling in the gasoline range is obtained in a high yield.The novel crystalline silicates which have the property of catalysing the above mentioned conversion are characterized as follows a they are thermally stable up to temperatures above 6000C, b they are capable, after dehydration at 4000C in vacuo, of absorbing more than 3 by weight of water at 25 C and saturated water vapour pressure, and c they possess in the dehydrated form the following overall composition, expressed in moles of the oxides, 1.0 0.3 R 2 ,0. a Fe,O,. b A1203. c Ga203 7. y d SiO2. e GeO2 , wherein R one or more mono or bivalent cations, a ,O.1, b 0 , c ,z, O a b c 1, y 10, d , 0.1, e , 0, d e 1, and n the valency of R. A drawback of the above mentioned single stage process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture from methanol is that a large amount of heat is liberated in the reaction. As a result it is extremely difficult to obviate undesirable temperature rises which adversely affect the catalyst life and the product composition. Prolonged investigation in respect of this subject by the Applicant has now shown that this drawback can be obviated by carrying out the process in two stages, methanol being converted into dimethyl ether in the first stage and dimethyl ether being converted into an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture in the second stage. The first stage of the process should be carried out by contacting methanol at elevated temperature with a dehydration catalyst and the sedond stage by contacting dimethyl ether at elevated temperature with a catalyst which contains a crystalline silicate as defined above. The present patent application therefore relates to a process for the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture from methanol, which process is carried out in two stages in which dimethyl ether is prepared in the first stage by contacting methanol at elevated temperature with a dehydration catalyst and in which in the second stage an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture is prepared by contacting dimethyl ether form the first stage at elevated temperature with a catalyst which contains a crystalline silicate as defined above. Methanol used as starting material in the process according to the invention may be very suitable prepared by contacting a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen called synthesis gas at elevated temperature with a methanol synthesis catalyst. The methanol preparation is preferably effected by contacting the synthesis gas at a temperature between 200 and 1L000C and a pressure between 25 and 425 bar with a catalyst containing zinc and or copper. The preparation of the synthesis gas required for the methanol synthesis is preferably effected by gasification of coal or liquid petroleum fractions or, starting from natural gas, by catalytic steam reforming or partial oxidation. In the first stage of the process according to the invention dimethyl ether should be prepared by contacting methanol at elevated temperature with a dehydration catalyst.Suitable dehydration catalysts are liquid acids such as sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid and solid inorganic and organic catalysts, such as phosphoric acid supported on kiezelguhr, silica aluminas having a large surface, acidic aluminas, acid treated clays, bauxite and polystyrene sulphonic acids. The preferred catalyst is gamma alumina. The first stage of the process is preferably carried out at a temperature between 250 and 400 C, a pressure between 1 and 50 bar and a space velocity between 0.5 and 20 kg 1 1. In the first stage of the process a reaction product is obtained which consists of a mixture of dimethyl ether, water and unconverted methanol. If desired, this mixture can be used as such as feed for the second stage.Preferably, however, at least part of the water and in particular essentially all the water is removed therefrom before the mixture is used as feed for the second stage. Further it is preferred to separate also non converted methanol from the reaction product of the first stage and to recycle at least part thereof. In the second stage of the process according the invention an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture is prepared from dimethyl ether originating from the first stage while using a catalyst which contains a crystalline silicate belonging to a special class.These silicates effect a high conversion of aliphatic hydrocarbons into aromatic hydrocarbons in commercially desired yields and are generally highly active in conversion reactions involving aromatic hydrocarbons. In the process according to the invention it is preferred to use silicates which do not contain gallium and germanium, in other words, silicates of which c and e in the above overall composition equal 0.Silicates of this type are the subject of the Netherlands patent application No. 7613957. It is also preferred to use silicates of which a in the above mentioned overall composition is greater than 0.5. Silicates which do not contain aluminium, in other words, silicates of which b in the above mentioned overall composition is 0 are particularly preferred. As regards y it may be noted that in the silicates used in the process according to the invention, this term should preferably be less than 800 and in particular less than 600. Finally, in the process according to the invention it is preferred to use silicates of which the X ray powder diffraction pattern contains inter alia the reflections mentioned inTable A of the Netherlands patent application No. 7613957.The second stage of the process according to the invention is preferably carried out at a temperature between 250 and 500 C and in particular between 325 and 450 C, a pressure between 0.5 and 100 bar and in particular between 1 and 1 1 40 bar, and a space velocity between 0.1 and 20 1.1 .h and in particular between 0.5 and 10 1.11 .h1. By making use of the two stage embodiment as proposed in this application in the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture starting from methanol, the temperature control of the process is considerably simplified. A further simplification in this respect can be achieved by adding a gaseous light hydrocarbon fraction as diluent to the feed for the second stage. The process according to the invention may, for example, very suitably be carried out by mixing with a C5 fraction the reaction product from the first stage, which consists of dimethyl ether, water and unconverted methanol, converting the resultant mixture in the second stage, separating the reaction product from the second stage after cooling into water, a C5 fraction and an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture boiling in the gasoline range, and recycling a portion of the C5 fraction to the second stage.If the process is carried out in this way the heating up of the methanol feed for the first stage and of the C5 fraction envisaged as diluent in the second stage may very suitably be carried out by indirect heat exchange with the hot reaction product from the second stage. To this end the hot reaction product from the second stage is preferably divided into two portions in such a way that one portion is sufficient for the heating up of the methanol feed to the desired reaction temperature and the other portion is sufficient for the heating up of the C5 recycle stream. In the process according to the invention a product is obtained which contains durene. If the durene content of the prepared hydrocarbon mixture amounts to more than a few percent and this mixture is intended to be used as gasoline, the durene content has to be reduced. This may be effected by splitting the aromatic hydrocarbon mixture into a Cg fraction and a C10 fraction, removing durene from the C10 fraction, for example by crystallization, and mixing the remaining C10 fraction with the Cg fraction. 9 Since the crystalline silicate containing catalysts which are used in the second stage of the process possess the property to convert durene which is present in the feed above a certain concentration into useful gasoline components, the durene separated from the reaction product of the second stage or the durene containing C10 fraction separated from the reaction product of the second stage is preferably recycled to the second stage. Temperature control of the process according to the invention may also very suitably be carried out by internal or external cooling of the reactor or reactors in which the second stage is performed. External cooling may for example, be carried out by performing the second stage of the process in an apparatus in which a number of tubular reactors in parallel arrangement are present, each reactor containing a fixed catalyst bed, and by surrounding the reactors with a coolant. Internal cooling may for example be carried out by performing the second stage of the process in a reactor in which a number of fixed catalyst beds are present, and by injecting a coolant between the catalyst beds.If the second stage of the process is carried out by passing the feed upwardly through a vertically arranged reactor which contains a fluidized catalyst bed while using catalyst recirculation, internal cooling can be effected by injecting part of the catalyst to be recycled รand or a coolant into the fluidized catalyst bed at different levels. When using internal cooling, the cooling liquid used can very suitably be methanol and or dimethyl ether separated from the reaction product of the first stage or a durene containing C10 fraction separated from the reaction product of the second stage. The crystalline silicates which are used as catalysts in the second stage of the process according to the invention are as a rule prepared starting from an aqueous mixture containing the following compounds in a given ratio one or more compounds of an alkali metal, one or more compounds which contain an organic cation or from which such a cation is formed during the preparation of the silicate, one or more silicon compounds, one or more iron compounds and possibly one or more aluminium, gallium and or germanium compounds. The preparation is effected by maintaining the mixture at elevated temperature until the silicate has been formed and by subsequently separating the silicate crystals from the mother liquor. Before being used in the process according to the invention the organic cations introduced during the preparation should be converted into hydrogen ions by calcination.In the process use is preferably made of silicates having an alkali metal content of less than 1 by weight and in particular less than 0.05 by weight. Such silicates can be prepared from the above mentioned calcined silicates by ion exchange, for example with an aqueous solution of an ammonium salt, followed by calcination. Aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures prepared from methanol using a catalyst containing a crystalline silicate according to the invention are very suitable for use as motor gasoline.This applies both to the mixtures which have been prepared according to the two stage process of the invention and to those prepared according to the single stage process.It has been found that the quality of these mixtures for use as motor gasoline can be further improved by incorporating natural gas condensate. Motor gasolines composed of 70 85 by volume of the said aromatic mixtures and 15 30 by volume of natural gas condensate are preferred.Preference is further given to such motor gasolines to which n butane has also been added as well, in particular motor gasolines composed of 60 80 by volume of said aromatic mIxtures, 20 30 by volume of natural gas condensate and up to 10 by volume of n butane. The invention will now be further elucidated with reference to the following example. A crystalline iron silicate silicate A was prepared as follows. A mixture of Fe N0 SiO2,NaNO3 and 33 tC3H7 tN 0H in water having the molar composition Na20.1.5 C3H7 4N 20. 0.125 Fe203. 25 SiO2. 468 H20 was heated at 150 and autogenous pressure for 48 hours in an autoclave. After cooling of the reaction mixture the resultant silicate was filtered off, washed with water until the pH of the wash water was approximately 8 and dried for 2 hours at 1200C. The silicate A thus prepared had the following chemical composition 0.8 C3H7 4N 2 0.3 Na2O. Fe203. 200 SiO2. 55 H20. The silicate had anX ray powder diffraction pattern substantially as mentioned in Table B of the Netherlands patent applicationNo. 7613957.The silicate was thermally stable up to temperatures in excess of 9000C and was capable, after dehydration at 400 C in vacuo, of adsorbing 7 by weight of water at 25 C and saturated water vapour pressure.Starting from silicate A a silicate B was prepared by consecutively calcining silicate A at 5000C, boiling it with 1.0 molar NH4N03 solution, washing it with water, reboiling it with 1.0 molar NH4N03 solution and by washing it, drying it at 12O0C and calcining it at 5000C.Example Silicate B was used as catalyst in the preparation of an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture from methanol and from dimethyl ether. To this end the relevant feed was passed at a pressure of 5 bar upwardly through a cylindrical, vertically arranged reactor which contained a fixed catalyst bed of silicate B, which had been brought to a temperature of 375 0C. In the experiment with methanol as feed, the space velocity was 1 1.1 .h . In the experiment with dimethyl ether as feed, a space velocity was used which, expressed in molar terms amounted to half of that used in the experiment with methanol as feed.
