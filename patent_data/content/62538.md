# Apparatus for locating faults in electric cables.

## Abstract
Apparatus for detecting and locating a fault in an electric cable or cable installation using a pulse echo or impulse current technique comprises a low voltage pulse generator for injecting a series of pulses into a cable or cable installation a digital store and memory for recording a predetermined number of pulses and for digitising and storing the waveforms obtained under normal and fault conditions of the cable means for terminating the record ing of pulses a predetermined time after a fault condition is detected and means for retrieving the signals obtained under the two separate conditions, comparing them and thus locating the position of the fault.
