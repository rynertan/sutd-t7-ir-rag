## Abstract
Fluorosubstituted benzaldehydes are condensed with anisil and ammonium acetate to yield the corresponding 2 fluorosubstituted phenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl imidazoles. Alternatively fluorosubstituted benzaldehydes are condensed with anisil monoxime and ammonium acetate to yield the corresponding 2 fluorosubstituted phenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl imidazole 3 oxides which can subsequently be reduced to yield the corresponding 2 fluorosubstituted phenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl imidazoles. These imidazoles have interesting pharmacological properties.

Pharmaz, 307, 492 1974 various imidazoles are prepared without any indication as to their utility. Radziszewski Chem. Ber. 10, 70 1877 , Cook and Jones J. Chem Soc. 278 1941 and others have found that a number of arylimidazoles exhibit chemiluminescence under certain conditions. This property can be utilized in certain copying techniques e.g. xerography and forms the basis of German Patent No. 1,106,599, Belgian Patent No.585,555 and French Patent No. 1,351,818. Certain 2,4,5 triarylimidazoles have been tested as anti fertility agents by Bhaduri and Khanna IndianJ Chem. 4, 419 1966 . Certain 2 alkyl 4,5 diarylimidazoles are describedin German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,064,520 as possessing analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic activity.One of the preferred compounds of this series, 2 isopropyl 4,5 bis 2methoxyphenyl imidazole, has been included in the pharmacological tests described hereinafter, from which it can be seen that this preferred compound possesses a much weaker analgesic activity than the compounds of the present invention. Certain 2,4,5 trisubstituted imidazoles containing a trifluoromethyl group in one of these positions and in some cases also substituted in the l position have been described in German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,155,558 cf. Lombardino and Wieseman J Med. Chem. 17, 1182 1974 .The preferred compound of this series, 2 trifluoromethyl 4,5 bis p metho,ryphenyl imidazole, has been included in the pharmacological data hereinafter described from which it will be seen that tests indicate this preferred compound to possess a weaker analgesic activity, but a higher toxicity than the compounds of the present invention Our British Patent No. 1,469,532 describes and clays certain imidazoles substituted in the l position by an acetic acid or propionic acid group or ester thereof. Our investigations on animal models conventionally employed in pharmacology using such compounds show that in general, arylimidazoles substituted in the l position by a propionic acid group are more active than the corresponding imidazole unsubstituted in the 1 position. The present invention is based on the discovery of certain 2 fluoro substituted phenyl 4,5 bis methoxy phenyl imidazoles unsubstituted in the l position which possess substantially improved properties over the compounds disclosed in German Offenlegungsschrift Nos. 2,064,520 and 2,155,558 and more particularly show improved activity over l 2 carhoxyethyl 2 fluorophenyl 4,5 bis methoxy phenyl imidazole, a corresponding imidazole substituted in the l position by a propionic acid group. Thus according to the present invention there are provided compounds of the formula EMI4.1 wherein one or two of the substituients R2, R , R4, R5 und R6 represent a fluorine atom while the remaining substituents are hydrogen atoms. Examples of compounds according to the present invention are 2 2 Fluorphenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl imidazole 2 3 Fluorphenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl imidazole 2 4 Fluorphenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl imidazole 2 2,3 Difluorphenyl 4,5 bis p rr,ethcxyphenyl imidazole 2 2,4 Difluorphenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl imidazole 2 2,4 Difluorphenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl imidazole 2 2,6 Difluorphenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl imidazole 2 3,4 Difluorphenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl imi.dazOie 2 3,5 Difluoxphenyl 4,5 bis p methoxyphenyl iMidazole Tests which we have conducted show the compounds of the invention are potent prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors both in vjtro and in vivo and possess interesting pharmacological properties.In particular the compounds of the invention exhibit good analgesic, antlinflanimatory and antipyretic activity whilst possessing low ulcerogenicity and toxicity The potency of the compounds of formula I is of the same order of magnitude.

The reaction may, for example, be effected in a manner analogous to the method of white and Sonnenberg J.Org. Chem. 29, 1926 1964 . Thus anisil, ammonium acetate and the appropriate aldehyde are reacted together conveniently in the presence of a protic solvent, preferably acetic acid. It is convenient to use the anisil and aldehyde in equimolar quantities in which case it is advantageous to use about five times the equimolar amount of ammonium acetate.It is convenient to use about 2 litres of solvent e.g. acetic acid per mole of anisil The reaction is conveniently effected at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixturc, but lower 4temperatures will also lead to the desired product. The precise proportion between the reactants, the concentration of each reactant and the reaction temperature is not of vital impcrtance. b the reduction of a compound of the formula EMI10.1 where R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as hereinbefore defined, whereby a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined is obtained. The reduction is advantageously effected in the presence of zinc, preferably in powder form,and is conveniently effected at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The compound of formula III is preferably first prepared by reacting anisil monoxime with ammoniurn acetate and a compound of formula II as hereinbefore defined. The reaction and reduction may, for example, be effected in a manner analogous to the method of,ll Lettnu Z hem. 11, 10 1971 . Thus anisil monoxime, ammonium acetate and the appropriate aldehyde are reacted together advantageously in the presence of a lower alkanoic acid, e.g. acetic acid, and the 3 oxide thus obtained is reduced, preferably in situ i.e. without isolation, conveniently by the addition of zine preferably in the form of a powder. It is convenient to use the anisil monoxime and aldehyde in equimoiar quantities in which case it is advantageous to use about ive times the equimolar amount of ammonium acetate.The amount of solvent used is conveniently 2 litres per mole of anisil monoxime The reaction is preferably effected at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.
