# HUE AND CONTRAST ADJUSTING CIRCUIT FOR A COLOUR TELEVISION RECEIVER.

## Abstract
A chroma processing circuit is branched from the output of a contrast control circuit connected to the video frequency detector circuit in a saturation and contrast control circuit of a color television receiver. The control signal for the contrast control circuit is released during the burst period, thereby controlling the contrast and the saturation with the control signal. The saturation and the contrast can be conrolled with a single gain control circuit, and the control characteristic curves of the contrast control circuit and the chroma processing circuit can be matched.
