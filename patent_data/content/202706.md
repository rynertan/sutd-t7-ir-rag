## Description
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a thermoplastic polymer on the basis of an alkenyl aromatic monomer, an unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride and optionally a rubber. Copolymers from alkenyl aromatic monomers and unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydrides are known. An example of these copolymers are the copolymers from styrene and maleic anhydride SMA . Preparation of these copolymers may take place both by batch processes and by continuous processes. The first commercial SMA copolymers were low molecular products with molecular weights below 5000. These types were applied in, for instance, floor shampoos, floor waxes, emulsion paints and dispersing agents. Besides these low molecular products, the high molecular SMA copolymers are of importance in, for instance, the automotive industry and in domestic articles. Copolymers of styrene and or α methylstyrene and maleic anhydride are generally prepared by customary methods for, for instance, mass polymerization or solution polymerization. Thus, for instance, according to US A 2,971,939 copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride can be obtained by reacting both monomers, styrene and maleic anhydride, in the presence of a peroxide. Better polymerization control is achieved by application of a solvent, for instance methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, xylene, dioxane, ethylbenzene, dimethylformamide or toluene. A 50 50 molar copolymer can be obtained by discontinous copolymerization of styrene and maleic anhydride, for instance by precipitation polymerization of styrene and maleic anhydride in aromatic solvents. Copolymers with a lower maleic anhydride content can be obtained if in continuous copolymerization a mixture of much styrene and little maleic anhydride is introduced into a polymerization vessel with vigorous stirring and at a high temperature, while an identical amount of the polymerization mixture is simultaneously removed from the vessel A.W. Hanson and R.L. Zimmermann, Industrial Engineering Chemistry 49, p. 1803, 1957 . High molecular SMA polymers can be processed by extrusion and injection moulding. The theoretical upper limit of the MA content is 50 mole alternating copolymers , but as high molecular copolymers these products cannot be processed on account of the high softening point 220 C . In addition, the brittleness and water sensitivity increase with the MA content. Copolymers with a lower MA content and a higher molar mass, on the other hand, can be processed much easier. Of great importance in this context is the small dispersion in MA incorporation, which imposes high demands on the homogenity of the reaction mixture. As is evident from US patent 4,141,934, there already is a large number of publications relating to processes aimed at mixing of styrene and maleic anhydride, without any of these describing a process by which polymers can be prepared without inhomogeneity. On pages 4 and 5 of European OPI patent application EP A 0027274 it is stated that the process disclosed in US patent 4,141,934 does not give the desired result, either, yielding heterogeneous reaction products. The processes described cannot be used to effect the entire polymerization in a one single tank reactor and attain the desired conversion of more than 80 while retaining product homogeneity. To achieve the desired values, a second reactor with metering equipment is used. During copolymerization of aromatic monomers and unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydrides in mass or in the presence of a solvent, the viscosity of the reaction mixture to be polymerized rises to values that are higher as the degree of conversion is higher, making it even more difficult to obtain a homogeneous mixture. The object of the invention is to obtain a process for the preparation of a thermoplastic polymer on the basis of an alkenyl aromatic monomer, an unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride and, optionally, a rubber, that does not exhibit said disadvantages. The process according to the invention is characterized in that the monomers and or solution thereof are is reacted, in a vessel with a substantially cylindrical wall 1 , provided with a coaxial guide tube 4 , which on both ends is in open connection with the vessel, and rotating shaft 7 , which is provided with one or more mixing devices 6 , and a conveying device comprising one or more screw ribbons 11 , which are so located between the inner wall of the vessel and the outer wall of the guide tube as to allow rotation, the reaction mixture being circulated through the vessel in a circulation time from 0.1 to 30 seconds. Using the process according to the invention, a homogeneous product of constant composition is obtained. The homogeneity of the product is determined from the width of the glass transition range Tg range . Glass transition ranges of less than 9 C are considered narrow transition ranges, indicating that the copolymer in question is of homogeneous composition. Less homogeneous copolymers have glass transition ranges of more than 9 C. By application of the process according to the invention, therefore, a copolymer with a small dispersion in unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride incorporation is obtained, leading to a narrow Tg range. The process according to the invention does not impose any restrictions on the conversion in the tank reactor, so that the entire polymerization process can be carried out in one step. As alkenyl aromatic monomers, in the process according to the invention preferred use can be made of styrene, α methylstyrene, paravinyl toluene. Other suitable monomers are halogen substituted styrenes. The preferrend unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydrides used in the process according to the invention is maleic anhydride. Other suitable unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydrides are chloromaleic anhydride, dichloromaleic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, phenylmaleic anhydride, aconitic anhydride, and mixtures of these. As termonomer the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer may contain 0 30 wt. acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile or an acrylate such as methylmethacrylate or ethylacrylate. Preferably, the terpolymer contains at least 5 wt. acrylonitrile. Preferred rubbers used in the process according to the invention are ethylene propylene copolymers, ethylene propylene copolymers in which other polyunsaturated monomers have been copolymerized, polybutadiene, styrene butadiene rubber, butadiene acrylonitrile rubber, polychloroprene, acrylate rubber, chlorinated polyethylene rubber, polyisoprene and cyclcoolefin rubbers. Polymerization is preferably effected in mass or in the presence of a non reactive solvent for the monomer, polymer and, optionally, the rubber. Examples of the initiators that may be used are benzoyl peroxide, 2,4 dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, di tert butyl peroxide, tert butyl peroxybenzoate, dicumyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, tert butyl perisobutyrate, tert butyl peroxyisopropylcarbonate, tert butyl peroxypivalate, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, stearoyl peroxide, tert butyl hydroperoxide, lauroyl peroxide, azo bis isobutyronitrile or mixtures thereof. The total amount of initiator required can be added simultaneously with the monomer feed. By using a mixture of these initiators with different activation temperatures or different half life periods, or by supplying one and the same initiator, or different initiators, at several places, optimum conversion can be achieved and the product properties can be varied. The introduction of initiator at several places may promote good temperature control, especially when high activity initiators are used. Polymerization may also be effected at elevated temperature in the absence of an initiator. As is customary in the polymerization of vinyl monomers, here, too, a chain length regulator can be added. Use can be made of the compounds customarily applied to this purpose. Examples are n butyl mercaptane, tertiary amyl mercaptane, n octyl mercaptane. Chain length regulators having a somewhat lower activity may also be used, for instance diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 2,2,4 trimethyl pentanediol, 1,5,diethylene glycol monobutylether and high boiling aliphatic alcohols. These compounds in addition have a viscosity reducing effect. To the polymerization mixture the customary additives, such as stabilizers, antioxidants, lubricants, fillers, pigments, etc., may be added. The polymerization temperature is preferably from 50 to 200 C. Suitable temperatures are from 80 to 150 C. The pressure in the reactor generally is between 2 and 100 bar, depending, inter alia, on mixer type, circulation rate, temperature and viscosity of the reaction mass. Suitable pressures are from 5 to 50 bar. If relatively volatile monomers or other additives are used, a pressure from 10 to 75 bar can be applied. In the process according to the invention both the circulation time and the mixing time, which are both influenced by the speed of the screw ribbon and that of the mixing device, are of major importance. The circulation time, defined as the time it takes a volume element to circulate through the entire reactor along a flow path, is from 0.1 to 30 seconds, in particular from 1 to 10 seconds. The mixing time is preferably from 0.1 to 300 seconds, in particular from 1 to 70 seconds. The mixing time is defined as the time needed for equalization of the concentration of a fed substance to such an extent that the concentration at any place deviates by less than 5 from the calculated final value. A very suitable mixing time is 10 times the circulation time or shorter. The copolymers prepared according to the invention have a preferred weight average molecular weight of from 30,000 to 500,000, in particular from 75,000 to 300,000. The weight average molecular weight Mw can be determined via a method described in Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 20, 1619 1626 1976 . By determination of the intrinsic viscosity at 25.0 C in tetrahydrofuran a method has been developed for determining, by a one point determination, the weight average molecular weight The styrene maleic anhydride copolymers pared according to the invention have a maleic anhydride content of from 15 to 35 wt. and a styrene content of from 65 to 85 wt. . By preference, a copolymer with a maleic anhydride content of from 20 to 30wt. and a styrene content of from 70 to 80 wt. is prepared. For further processing of the solution, it is useful to maximize conversion. After removal of the solvent, this yields a highly concentrated solution, the solids content of which corresponds with the conversion, which can be extruded without prior evaporation. The equipment used in the invention has a conveying device consisting of one or more screw ribbons, which are so installed between the inner wall of the vessel and the outer wall of the guide tube that they can be made to rotate around the vessel axis. If use is made of various propellors, placed at a distance from one another, the feeding device for each of the components to be mixed can now be installed before a stirring device, viewed in the direction of flow. According to Dutch patent specification 158393, such equipment would have the disadvantage that during polymerization the low viscosity monomer that is continuously supplied through the connection for the main stream is not instantaneously mixed uniformly with the high viscosity reaction mixture. As a result, the monomer forms a layer, separate from the reaction mixture near the reactor inlet, which is not constant but changes from time to time, and which at one moment occupies about 20 of the volume of the reaction vessel, while the next moment it has disappeared altogether. Such an unstable monomer layer renders it very difficult to control the temperature in the reaction mixture and gives rise to fluctuations in the quality of the polymers prepared. The invention will be elucidated on the basis of the embodiment represented in the drawing. A reactor vessel is made up of a substantially cylindrical shell, consisting of two detachable halfs 1 and 1 , that are connected, for instance, by means of flanges 2 and 2 . In the vessel there is a coaxial partition wall 3, which does not continue to the end faces of the vessel and which forms guide tube 4. For support purposes, the wall of this tube is one side attached rigidly to shell 1 , and this side is provided with openings 5 that are large enough to admit a liquid flow without offering much resistance. Within guide tube 4, stirrers 6, 6 , etc. are provided, for instance propellor mixers with two blades. Thus, the guide tube in fact forms a mixing chamber. The propellors are rigidly fastened to a rotating shaft 7, which is extended through a stuffing box 8 to outside the vessel, where this shaft can be driven. Each propellor brings about extremely good micromixing within a small distance from the mixing tube, provided speed and propellor are suitably chosen so that the product of revolutions per second times diameter in meters ² is at least 0.05 m² per second. The components to be mixed can now be introduced separately into the reactor, for instance such that each component is separately mixed into the main stream before a propellor, seen in the direction of flow. The polymerization referred to can effectively be brought about in this vessel by using a feed tube for suitably distributing a second component and raw materials, dispersing agent, and the like between these two streams, or feeding these separately. To this end, feed tubes 9, 9 , etc., are provided, which can be used to feed a component to propellor 6, 6 , etc., respectively. The supply and discharge of the main stream can take place via connections 10 and 10 . For completeness sake it is pointed out that such equipment is described in Dutch patent application laid open to public inspection No. 6516783. Moulding compounds prepared according to the invention are suitable for many applications. A wide variety of objects can be prepared from them, such as tubes, bottles, furniture, car dashboards, cabinets and housings for electronic and domestic appliances, shoe heels, caravans, skis and surf boards. The invention will be elucidated on the basis of the following examples and comparative experiments, without being restricted thereto. A reactor as described with reference to the figure, with a reactor volume of 0.004 m³ is continuously charged with a feed consisting of 42 wt. styrene, 13 wt. maleic anhydride MA , 0.2 wt. benzoyl peroxide BPO and 44.8 wt. methyl ethyl ketone MEK . The reaction temperature is 110 C, the residence time 4 hours. The propellor mixers in the guide tube have a speed of 2500 rpm, the ribbon mixer operates at 25 rpm. The solution leaving the reactor is collected in acetone and coagulated in methanol. The polymer is subsequently dried in a drying stove and then analyzed. Under the stirring conditions in this test, the circulation time of the solution is 7 seconds and the mixing time 42 seconds. The results presented in Table 1 show that a homogeneous product is obtained, the glass transition range being 6 C. In this example the ribbon mixer speed is 110 rpm, all other conditions being the same as in Example 1. The circulation time is 2.2 seconds and the mixing time 13 seconds. The copolymer obtained is of homogeneous composition. The propellor mixer is taken out of the reactor. The ribbon mixer speed is 100 rpm. All other conditions are as in Example 1. The circulation time is 6.6 seconds and the mixing time is undefined, but more than 70 seconds. A copolymer having a heterogeneous composition is obtained.

BPO. The reaction temperature is 110 C, the residence time 2 hours. The propellor mixer and the ribbon mixer operate at a speed of 2000 and 23 rpm, respectively. The circulation time is 8.6 seconds, as is the mixing time. The copolymer obtained has a homogeneous composition. This experiment was carried out in the same way as Example 3. The propellor mixer speed is 2000 rpm, the ribbon mixer speed 6 rpm. The circulation time and the mixing time both are 34.0 seconds. A copolymer of heterogeneous composition is obtained.

The reaction temperature is 130 C, the residence time 4 hours. The propellor mixers in the guide tube operate at 2000 rpm, and the ribbon mixer at 100 rpm. The circulation time is 3.0 seconds and the mixing time 18.0 seconds. The polymer obtained is of homogeneous composition.
