# IMPROVED DRUM ACCESSORY RAIL

## Abstract
The invention is an improved accessory support system. The system comprises a main bar supported by a plurality of support legs. The main bar is comprised of a plurality of bar members which are connected to each other by hinges that either fold or may be disassembled. The hinges are arranged, such that the bar members are capable of motion in the horizontal plane such that any configuration of the bar members around a central area may be obtained. The accessory support system may also be fabricated so that it is one piece that can fold up into a compact size for easy storage and portabiliry. The legs are adjustable for height and the bar members can be various sizes and shapes. In addition, additional bar members may be added to extend or reconfigure the accessory support system. The legs may each have a base plate to secure the legs to a positional reference member such as a riser at pre selected positions such that the exact configuration of the accessory support system can be reproduced.
