# Power supply circuit for driving a motor.

## Abstract
A power supply circuit for driving a motor includes a rectifier circuit 2 and a converter circuit 4 for stepping down the DC voltage from the rectifier circuit 2 to drive a motor 6 . The power supply circuit further includes a re gulator circuit 8, 10, 12 or 14 which is operable by the DC output voltage from the converter circuit 4 to supply a constant voltage or current to the motor 6 .
