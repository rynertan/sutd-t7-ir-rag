# A PROGRAMMABLE READ ONLY MEMORY ELEMENT AND METHOD OF FABRICATION THEREOF

## Abstract
A programmable read only memory PROM element is disclosed in which an N type epitaxial layer, grown on a P type substrate with an N buried layer therebetween, has a P type anode region formed in a surface portion thereof. An N type poly silicon layer is formed on the surface of the anode region, generally within an aperture in an insulating layer, with the dopant of the poly silicon layer being diffused downwardly into the anode region to form a shallow N type cathode region. A metal layer is deposited on the surface of the poly silicon layer over the anode region, and a low resis tivity path is provided to the buried layer. To program the memory element, a positive potential is applied to the metal layer relative to the buried layer to break down the barrier between the cathode and anode regions. As the reverse cur rent flow heats the poly silicon. the metal alloys through the poly silicon and the cathode region, and shorts to the anode region.
