## Description
ALARM SYSTEM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an alarm system associated with emergency detectors, such as a smoke detector and a heat detector, and connected to telephone lines. Conventional alarm systems are adapted to give an alarm, as by ringing a bell, to persons nearby when an emergency detector such as a smoke detector or a heat detector has operated. However, such conventional alarm systems are useless when there are no persons nearby who perceive the alarm. For instance, when there are no persons at night in a building in which one of the conventional alarm systems is installed, nobody will make a response to the operation of the system and therefore it may be impossible to prevent a serious accident by taking a proper step at the initial stage of the emergency. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly the present invention consists in an alarm system associated with emergency detectors, and has a memory for storing telephone numbers and an aural information recording device. The memory stores telephone numbers corresponding to telephone lines through which aural information is sent when an emergency detector is activated. When the emergency detector is activated, a telephone number stored in the memory is read out and delivered into corresponding telephone lines as call signals.The aural information recording device records the aural information to be sent when the emergency detector is activated. When the emergency detector is activated, the aural information recording device delivers the aural information through the telephone lines specified by the call signals. It is an object of the invention to provide an alarm system which can automatically send aural information to a telephone connected to predetermined telephone lines when an emergency detector has operated. It is another object of the invention to provide an alarm system which can dial a predetermined telephone number when an emergency detector has operated, and send aural information when the telephone has been answered, said aural information being that the emergency detector has operated. It is a further object of the invention to provide an alarm system which can dial a plurality of predetermined telephone numbers in regular sequence when an emergency detector has operated, and send aural information each time the telephone is answered, the aural information being that the emergency detector has operated. It is still another object of the invention to provide an alarm system which, when at least one of emergency detectors of different kinds has operated, dials a predetermined telephone number assigned to the emergency detector, and sends aural information when the telephone has been answered, the aural information being that said emergency detector has operated. It is still a further object of the invention to provide an alarm system which, when at least one of emergency detectors of different kinds has operated, dials in regular sequence a plurality of predetermined telephone numbers assigned to the emergency detector and sends aural information each time the telephone is answered, the aural information being that the emergency detector has operated. Other and further objects, features and advantages of the invention will appear more fully from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawing.

The panel of the keyboard 12 is also provided with a condenser microphone 56 and a switch 58 for selection between a memory lock position in which all the keys on the keyboard 12 are in enabled electric condition and a memory open position in which they are in disabled electric condition. As shown in Fig. 2, the alarm system 10 is provided at its bottom with a speaker 60, and at its rear with a connector 62 for connection with suitable emergency detectors not shown , a telephone connector 64 for connection with a pair of telephone lines T tip and R ring , a switch 66 by means of which call signals for telephone numbers are selected between 20 pps pulses per second and 10 pps, a jack 68 for connection with a suitable AC adapter, and a jack 70 for connection with a suitable DC battery. The connector 62 connects the alarm system 10 with four different kinds of emergency detectors consisting, for instance, of a smoke detector, a heat detector, a gas leakage detector and an electric leakage detector.That is, the connector 62 has five connecting terminals consisting of four terminals for connecting each of the channels A, B, C and D of the alarm system 10 with the detecting signal output line of each emergency detector, and one terminal for connecting the grounding conductor of the alarm system 10 with the grounding conductor of each emergency detector. The connector 62 is provided with a suitable cover not shown . The emergency detectors may also include an intruder detector or means for detecting any other abnormality. If the emergency detectors are designed to send detecting signals by radio, the alarm system 10 may be provided with a suitable receiver for receiving the radio detecting signals. As shown in Fig. 4, the alarm system 10 is provided with a power circuit 72 for supplying electric circuits within the alarm system 10 with DC voltage e.g. DC 12 volt received through the AC adapter connected to the jack 68 or from the DC battery connected to the jack 70. The alarm system 10 is further provided with a receiver circuit 74 for receiving detecting signals from the emergency detectors connected by means of the connector 62 and adjusting the signals so as to suit them to subsequent processing within the alarm system 10, a CPU central processing unit 76 for judging which of the channelsA, B, C and D the detecting signals received by the receiver circuit 74 belongs to that is, which of the emergency detectors has sent the signal and then processing the signal, and a control circuit 78 for adjusting output signals, prepared within the alarm system 10, into signals suitable for being delivered through the telephone lines T and R. The CPU 76 is connected with the memory 22 which, in turn, is connected with a backup power supply 80. The CPU 76 is also connected with an input interface 82 which is connected with the keyboard 12, tape recording and playing decive 16, condenser microphone 56, switches 58 and 66, and control circuit 78.The CPU 76 is further connected with an output interface 84 which is connected with the tape recording and playing device 16, indicators 42, 44, 46, 48, 50 and 52, speaker 60 and control circuit 78. Furthermore, the CPU 76 is directly connected with the tape recording and playing device 16 and control circuit 78, and is also connected through the input interface 82 and output interface 84 with a single amplifier 86. This amplifier 86 is a common one for both the microphone 56 and speaker 60. To use the alarm system 10, it is necessary to make preparations as follows Telephone numbers are stored in the memory 22 as follows First, the AC adapter is connected to the jack 68, or the DC battery is connected to the jack 70. Then, the power indicator 54 will be turned on, and DC voltage will be supplied to each electric circuit of the alarm system 10. The switch 58 is set on the memory open position in which all the keys on the keyboard 12 are in enabled electric condition.In this state, if the following procedures are taken, the CPU 76 will behave in accordance with a program to store telephone numbers in the memory 22 as shown in Fig. Sa to 5e.Flow charts for telephone number memory keys 28 B1 to B4 , 30 C1 to C4 or 32 D1 to D4 are the same as the flow charts of Figs. 5a to 5d for telephone number memory keys 26 A1 to A4 . Therefore, Fig. Se shows procedures for the telephone number memory keys 28 B1 and 32 D4 only, and does not show procedures for the telephone number memory keys 28 B2 to B4 , 30 C1 to C4 and 32 D1 to D3 . First, the memory key 34 is pushed. At this time, the speaker 60 will emit a sound for confirmation. Then, an address within the memory 22 is determined by pushing one of the telephone number memory keys 26 A1 to 26 A4 , 28 B1 to 28 B4 , 30 C1 to 30 C4 or 32 D1 to D4 . At this time, the sound for confirmation is emitted again. Now a desired telephone number is inputted by means of the ten keys 24. The sound for confirmation will be emitted each time a key 24 is pushed. If, for example, a telephone exchange within an office needs 0 before the telephone number for connection with a city telephone, the key 24 for 0 and then the pause key 36 are pushed before the telephone number is inputted. After the teleophone number is inputted, the memory key 34 is pushed again. Now the inputted telephone number is stored in the address within the memory 22.Next, another one of the telephone number memory keys 26 A1 to 26 A4 , 28 B1 to 28 B4 , 30 C1 to 39 C4 and 32 D1 to 32 D4 is pushed, and another telephone number is inputted. In the same way, each of other desired telephone numbers is inputted for each of other telephone number memory keys. Thus, these telephone numbers are stored in their respective addresses within the memory 22. Any telephone number stored in the memory 22 can be erased as follows The memory key 34 is pushed, and then one telephone number memory key corresponding to the stored telephone number to be erased is pushed. Next, the same telephone number memory key is pushed without the keys 24 being pushed. Aural information is recorded as follows First, DC voltage is supplied to each electric circuit of the alarm system 10 and the switch 58 is pushed to the memory open position in the same way as in storing telepone numbers. Then, the top cover 18 is opened and the cassette magnetic tape 20 is loaded into the tape recording and playing device 16. In this state, if the following procedures are taken, theCPU 76 will behave in accordance with a program to store the aural information in the cassette magnetic tape 20 as shown in Fig. 6. First, the memory key 34 is pushed. At this time, the speaker 60 will emit a sound for confirmation. The record key 34 is pushed. Then, a recording location within the cassette magnetic tape 20 corresponding to one of the channelsA, B, C or D is determined by pushing one of the telephone number memory keys 26 A1 , 28 B1 , 30 C1 and 32 D1 .Then, the recording indicator 50 and one of the channel indicators 42, 44, 46 and 48 corresponding to said recording location will be turned on, and the tape recording and playing device 16 will start the recording operation. If desired aural information is inputted through the microphone 56 at this time, the aural information will be recorded in the recording location on the cassette magnetic tape 20. In a certain period of the about 50 seconds, for example , after the starting of the recording operation, the speaker 60 will emit an intermittent sound, the tape recording and playing device 16 finishing the recording operation and the recording indicator 50 being turned off. Next, the memory key 34, record key 38 and another one of the telephone number memory keys 26 A1 , 28 B1 , 39 C1 and 32 D1 are pushed in this order, and then the aural information is inputted.In the same way, desired aural information is inputted for each of the telephone number memory keys 26 A1 , 28 B1 , 30 C1 and 32 D1 . Thus, each piece of such aural information is stored in its location within the cassette magnetic tape 20.The telephone number memory key 26 A1 actuates the tape recording and playing device 16 on behalf of the four keys 29 A1 to A4 in the channel A. The telephone number memory key 28 B1 actuates the tape recording and playing device 16 on behalf of the four keys 28 B1 to B4 in the channel B.The telephone number memory key 30 C1 actuates the tape recording and playing device 16 on behalf of the four keys 30 C1 to C4 in the channel C. The telephone number memory key 32 D1 actuates the tape recording and playing device 16 on behalf of the four keys 32 D1 to D4 in the channel D. The cassette magnetic tape 20 is preferably an endless tape having four tracks corresponding to the channels A, B, C and D, but it is not resticted thereto. The aural information recorded in the cassette magnetic tape 20 can be reproduced for confirmation, as follows The memory key 34 and then the test key 40 are pushed. Next, one of the telephone number memory keys 26 A1 , 28 B1 , 30 C1 and 32 D1 corresponding to the location of the cassette magnetic tape 20 to be played, that is, one of the keys corresponding to the channel to be tested, is pushed see Fig. 7. . Then, the playing indicator 52 will be turned on, and the tape recording and playing device 16 will start the playing operation so that the aural information recorded in the channel is reproduced through the speaker 60. In a certain period of time preferably about 50 seconds, but not being restricted thereto inasmuch the aural information recorded in the channel can be reproduced to its end after the starting of the playing operation, the speaker 60 will emit an intermittent sound, the tape recording and playing device 16 finishing the playing operation and the playing indicator 52 being turned off. In addition to the storing of the telephone numbers and the recording of the aural information, it is further necessary to make the following preparations By means of the connector 62, the detecting signal output line of each of the smoke detector, heat detector, gas leakage detector and electric leakage detector is connected with each of the channels A, B, C and D, and the grounding conductor of each emergency detector is connected with the grounding conductor of the alarm system 10. The telephone lines T and R are connected with the alarm system 10 by means of the connector 64. Also, the telephone number call speed is selected between 20 pps and 10 pps by means of the switch 66.Furthermore, the switch 58 is pushed to the memory lock position in which all the keys are in disabled electric condition in order to prevent the stored telephone numbers or the recorded aural information from being erased by an inadvertent actuation of the keyboard 12. Operation If the smoke detector, heat detector, gas leakage detector or electric leakage detector is activated after the above mentioned preparations have been made , the CPU 76 will behve in accordance with the program of Fig. 8 and call signals for a telephone number corresponding to the detecting signal received and aural information corresponding to said detecting signal are delivered. For example, when the smoke detector channel is activated and sends a detecting signal, the detecting signal will enter the receiver circuit 74 through the connector 62, and will be evaluated by the CPU 76 to belong to the channel A. Then, the speaker 60 will be separated from the electric circuit and the channel indicator 42 will be turned on.Confirmation will now be made as to whether a telephone number is stored in an address within the memory 22 corresponding to the telephone number memory key 26 A1 . If in store, the telephone number will be read out and delivered through the control circuit 78 into the telephone lines T and R as call signals. If pause datum is stored on this address within the memory 22 together with the telephone nurnber, 0 signal will be delivered and, after a pause, the call signals for the telephone number will be delivered. Then, the tape recording and playing device 16 will start the playing operation, and the aural information recorded in the channel A of the cassette magnetic tape 20 will be reproduced and delivered through the control circuit 78 into the telephone lines T and R. In a certain period of time a period of time allotted to the channel A, which may be about 50 seconds after the starting of the playing operation, the tape recording and playing device 16 will stop the playing operation.If, in the aforesaid confirmation, no telephone number is found in said. address within the memory 22 corresponding to the telephone number memory 26 A1 , the reading out of the telephone number and the reproduction of the aural information will be jumped over and the next confirmation procedure will be made. In particular, when the tape recording and playing device 16 finishes the playing operation, the next confirmation will be made as to whether a telephone number is stored in an address within the memory 22 corresponding to the telephone number memory key 26 A2 . If stored, the telephone number will be read out and delivered into the telephone lines T and R as call signals. Then, the aforesaid aural information stored in the channel A of the cassette magnetic tape 20 will be reproduced and delivered into the telephone lines T and R again.In this way, confirmation will be made in regular sequence as to whether a telephone number is stored in each address within the memory 22 corresponding to each of the telephone number memory keys 26 A1 to A4 . If a telephone number is found in the final confirmation, then after the delivery of the call signals for the telephone number and the subsequent delivery of the aural information in the channel A, the channel indicator 42 will be turned off and the CPU 76 will finish its operation. When the heat detector channel B is activated and sends a detecting signal, the detecting signal will enter the receiver circuit 74 and will be judged by the CPU 76 to belong to the channel B. The speaker 60 will be separated from the electric circuit and the channel indicator 44 will be turned on. Then, confirmation will be made in regular sequence as to whether a telephone number is stored in each address within the memory 22 corresponding to each of the telephone number memory keys 28 B1 to B4 in the channel B. If the telephone number is stored, call signals will be delivered and the aural information recorded in the channel B of the cassette magnetic tape 20 will be delivered. After that, the channel indicator 44 will be turned off. When a gas leakage detector channel C is activated and sends a detecting signal, the detecting signal will enter the receiver circuit 76 and will be judged by the CPU 76 to belong to the channel C. In the same way as mentioned above, call signals for the telephone number stored in each address within the memory 22 corresponding to each of the telephone number memory keys 30 C1 to C4 in the channel C are delivered in regular sequence, and the aural information recorded in the channel C of the cassette magnetic tape 20 is delivered each time. When the electric leakage detector pertaining to channelD is activated and sends a detecting signal, the detecting signal will enter the receiver circuit 74 and will be judged by the CPU 76 to belong to the channel D. Then, call signals for telephone number stored in each address within the memory 22 corresponding to each of the telephone number memory keys 32 D1 to D4 in the channel D are delivered in regular sequence, and the aural information recorded in the channel D of the casette magnetic tape 20 is delivered each time. If, for example, the alarm system 10 receives a detecting signal from the heat detector when the calling of a telephone number or the delivery of the aural information in the channel A is in progress on the basis of a detecting signal from the smoke detector, then the calling of each telephone number and the delivery of the aural information in the channel B will be performed after the calling of all the telephone numbers and the delivery of the aural information in the channel A, are completed. The alarm system 10 is installed, for example, in a building in which there are no persons at night. If the smoke detector, heat detector, gas leakage detector or electric leakage detector operate at night, the alarm system 10 will automatically dial each of the telephone numbers stored in the memory 22 corresponding to the detector and automatically send the aural information recorded in the cassette magnetic tape 20. The aural information may be a message that the emergency detector has been activated. The telephone numbers to be automatically dialed may be, for example, those of the private residences, etc. of the superintendents or other persons in charge of the building, or the telephone number of a company guarding the building by contract.Such persons who have received information by telephone from the alarm system 10 can thus take proper steps at the initial stage of the emergency. Since the alarm system 10 automatically dials a plurality of telephone numbers in sequence, there is a strong possibility of the aural information or message being received even when some of the aforesaid persons do not answer the telephone. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a serious accident by taking a proper step at the initial stage of the emergency. Thus, the alarm system 10 may deliver the aural information after the call signals no matter whether the telephone is answered. Or, the alarm system 10 may deliver the aural information soon after confirming that the telephone is answered.Alternatively, if the telephone remains unanswered for a certain period of time, the alarm system 10 may dial the next telephone number without delivering the aural information. Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specificially described.
