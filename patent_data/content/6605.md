# Fluid, stable interpolymer polyol compositions, process for the production thereof and processes for the production of elastomeric polyurethanes and polyurethane foams therefrom.

## Abstract
Fluid, stable polymer polyols are provided which con sist of an organic polyol medium and an interpolymer of a minor amount of polymerized ethylenically unsaturated di carboxylic acid anhydride, such as maleic acid anhydride, and a major amount of at least one different polymerized ethylenically unsaturated monomer, the interpolymer being in the form of particles that are stably dispersed in the polyol. Polyurethane foams produced from these polymer polyols display improved load bearing and compression set when compared with polymer polyols produced in a similar manner without the ethylenically unsaturated di carboxylic acid anhydride elastomers so produced have improved tensile modulus and tear properties.
