## Description
The present invention is concerned with a process for filling deep dielectric isolation trenches in semicon ductor devices and with devices prepared by the process. A new approach in improved semiconductor devices depends upon the use of deep dielectric isolation trenches to achieve much higher densities as well as higher speeds. Such trenches can be filled with polyimide resin or polysilicon. See Japan Institute of Invention and Innovation Technical Disclosure No. 58 138049, page 46. See also IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin Vol. 25 No. 12, May 1983, pp 6611 6614. U.S. Patent 4,339,526 shows the use of an acetylene terminated branched polyphenylene prepolymer as a protective coating for an integrated circuit device. The patent, however, does not discuss the concept of filling deep dielectric isolation trenches and it does not teach the process of the present invention. According to the present invention, deep dielectric isolation trenches in a semiconductor device are filled by a process comprising the steps of dissolving a polyaromatic oligomer with reactive ethynyl groups in a solvent to form a solution of controlled viscosity. This solution is then filtered through a very fine filter, and then used for coating the trench containing semiconductor device with a film. Upon heating the device, solvent is evaporated and the film is cured. When the solvent is evaporated, but before the sample cures, the oligomer melts, flows and fills the trenches in the temperature range of 80 125 C, but as low as ambient conditions to as high as 160 C. It then polymerizes by the reaction of the ethynyl groups at higher temperatures. In development of semiconductor devices incorporating dielectric isolation trenches about 1 to 2 µm in width and about 5 µm in depth a number of problems have been identified with the use of polyimides or polysilicon. The polyimides used in the prior art do not completely fill these trenches. Furthermore, the polyimides absorb solvents, water and gases which greatly complicates subsequent processing. Polyimides are soluble in only a limited number of solvents and usually require an adhesion promoter. Their curing involves the evolution of volatile products. The cured polyimides swell in many processing solvents and their planarization is limited. The polysilicon also used in the prior art requires a very expensive vapor deposition step, creates localized stresses and also has the disadvantage of not being a very good electric insulator. The materials of the present invention overcome all these disadvantages of the prior art. For use in the present invention, the trench filling material is a polyaromatic oligomer with reactive ethynyl groups. These materials are known to the prior art and are derived from a number of different monomers including triethynylbenzene TEB , diethynyldiphenylether DEDPE , and phenylacetylene PA . Other useful aromatic acetylene containing monomers are listed, for example, in U.S. patent 4,097,460. One of the advantages of the present process is that it is suitable for use with any of many solvents. Initial ly, the oligomer is dissolved in a solvent and applied to the semiconductor device by spin coating. Useful solvents include, for example, N methyl pyrrolidinone, xylenes, diglyme, mesitylene, diethylbenzene, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, tetraglyme, isophorone, veratrole, m dimethoxybenzene, butyrolactone, toluene, chloroform, dioxane and dichloromethane. In the coating process the viscosity of the solution should be controlled so that complete filling of the trenches is obtained. The viscosity is controlled in two ways. One, by controlling the ratio of solvent to solute the more dilute the solution, the less viscous it is, and two, by controlling the molecular weight of the oligomer the lower the molecular weight, the lower the viscosity. In general, the viscosity of the solution is preferably on the order of about 2 x 10 It is important that the oligomer solution be filtered before the coating operation. The presence of even minute amounts of suspended particles could be a serious contaminant to the semiconductor device. Such filtration can readily be obtained using, for example, a 0.5µm filter. Evaporation of the solvent is readily obtained by simple application of heat and, in like manner, the coating films are cured by the application of heat. By the process of the present invention, outstandingly good results have been obtained in complete filling of the trenches. The filling material is thermally stable up to 400 C with no decomposition or evolution of volatiles. The monomer, diethynyldiphenylether DEDPE 825 mmoles , is placed into a four necked one liter round bottomed flask. Nickel 2,4 pentanedionate 4.16 mmoles and triphenylphosphine 11.6 mmoles are then added and are washed in with phenylacetylene 1320 mmoles and dioxane 301 ml . The flask is equipped with a matched pair of reflux condensers, nitrogen and vacuum inlets and vacuum regulator, overhead stirrer, heating mantle and thermocouple. The contents are stirred under nitrogen until the reaction is homo geneous. The flask is then deoxygenated three times with vacuum nitrogen. The mantle skin temperature is taken to 200 C and the internal temperature of the flask is maintained at 90 C for three and one half hours using the vacuum regulator to control reflux at that temperature 0.505 to 0.609 bar vacuum . The reaction is cooled at this point by vacuum refluxing. The thick polymer solution is diluted with dioxane containing small amounts of ammonium hydroxide and methanol and precipitated by slow addition to 6 volumes of 10 1 methanol ammonium hydroxide under high shear agitation. The precipitated polymer is isolated by filtration, washed with methanol, and dried under vacuum. The nickel content of the polymer is further reduced by acid extraction. The dry polymer is dis solved in 1.5 l of toluene and extracted with 5 aq. HC1 3 X 300 ml and water 2 X 500 ml , dried with MgSO₄, and filtered once again. The resulting polymer solution is precipitated by slow addition to 5 volumes of rapidly stirred methanol and the polymer isolated by filtration, washed with methanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 C to yield 248 grams of poly ethynylphenyl ether PEPE . A 40 wt solution of PEPE in 1,3 dimethoxybenzene is prepared. This solution is filtered through a 0.5 µm Fluoropore Set up a 1 liter, 4 necked round bottomed flask with a heating mantle, overhead stirrer, a powder funnel and two matched reflux condensers each with a nitrogen vacuum inlet. Connect the inlets via a manifold to a valve connected to nitrogen and a vacuum system. The vacuum system should have a regulator. Blow nitrogen through the system as the flask is charged through the powder funnel with 78.20 g 0.50 mol, 1.50 mol of ethynyl groups of triethynylbenzene TEB, 96 , 110.22 g 0.50 mol, 1.00 mol of ethynyl groups of diethynyl diphenylether DEDPE, 99 , 1.83 g 6.25 mmol of nickel 2,4 pentanedionate dihydrate and 4.60 g 17.5 mmol of triphenylphosphine. Rinse the powders in with 222 ml 2.02 mol of phenylacetylene PA and rinse the PA in with 368 ml of dioxane. The reaction is now 50 by weight in monomers. Replace the powder funnel with a thermowell and stir the reaction until it is homo geneous. Deoxygenate the reaction mixture three times with nitrogen, then heat the rapidly stirred solution quickly 15 minutes to 75 C. From 70 to 75 C pull a vacuum on the system to regulate the reflux at 75 C. When the desired molecular weight range is reached, refluxively cool the reaction to room temperature. Strip off the dioxane under vacuum. Redissolve the residue in 500 ml methylene chloride. Wash the organic solution with 5 HCl 3 x 200 ml and with deionized water 2 x 200 ml . Dry the organic phase over magne sium sulfate 50 g and filter through 100 g of silica gel. Strip the solution to a total of 800 g of solu tion. Add 20 g of diatomaceous earth and 20 g of magnesium sulfate and filter again. Precipitate the prepolymer by dripping the solution into 10 l of rapidly stirred methanol. Filter the golden yellow solid through a coarse glass frit funnel and then wash the filter cake with 250 ml methanol and briefly suck it dry. Dry the polymer in a vacuum oven at 45 55 C overnight. The expected yield will vary depending upon the reaction time. For a 20 minute reaction, the yield was 113.11 g 29 of a polymer with M The polymer, single step acetylenic thermoset prepolymer SSATP , was analyzed by NMR using toluene as an internal standard and the terminal acetylene content was determined to be 9.12 mmole g. The SSATP 50.0 g, 456 mmoles and phenylacetylene 1824 mmoles were placed into a 500 ml dropping funnel and the polymer was allowed to dissolve. Cuprous chloride 43.8 mmoles and tetramethylethylenediamine 43.8 mmoles were placed into a two liter three necked round bottomed flask and were washed in with 400 ml of chloroform. The flask was equipped with a magnetic stirrer, thermo couple, oxygen aspirator tube and the dropping funnel topped with a dry ice condenser. The catalyst solution was stirred and oxygen was introduced through the aspirator tube. The solution was brought to 28 C using a mantle skin temperature of 30 C. The polymer solution was quickly added. A slow exotherm took the reaction temperature to 38 C over a period of thirty minutes. The reaction was kept at 28 C overnight. The reaction mixture was placed into a two liter separatory funnel. The polymer solution was washed with 10 hydrochloric acid 3 X 400 ml and deionized water 2 X 400 ml . After drying over magnesium sulfate, the solution was filtered and rotary evaporated to dryness. The polymer was redissolved in methylene chloride and eluted with methylene chloride through a 250 g silica gel column. The polymer solution was then rotary evaporated to 500 g and 10 g each of magnesium sulfate and diatomaceous earth were added. After filtration, the polymer solution was precipitated slowly into 10 liters of rapidly stirring methanol. The slurry was filtered and the cake was washed with 500 ml of methanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 C to yield 64.23 g of bis acetylene terminated single step acetylenic thermoset polymer BAT SSATP . A 40 wt solution of BAT SSATP in N methylpyrrolidinone was prepared. This solution was filtered through a 0.5 µm Fluoropore The polymer PEPE, prepared as in Example 1, was analyzed by NMR using toluene as an internal standard and the terminal acetylene content was determined to be 1.04 mmol g. 10 g of the polymer, 2.4 ml iodobenzene 21.6 mmol , 540 mg triphenylphosphine .21 mmol , 410 mg cupric acetate monohydrate .21 mmol , 370 mg palladium chloride .21 mmol , 6.6 ml The Tolan PEPE described in the above paragraph was also prepared directly by reacting tolan capped monomers. Tolan capped diethynyldiphenylether was prepared by reacting iodobenzene with DEDPE and partially separating the monomers. The partially capped DEDPE and phenylace tylene were then cyclotrimerized until no further reaction was apparent by infrared techniques. This process provided a PEPE like polymer with tolan reactive sites and very few terminal acetylenes. In a 1000 ml 3 neck round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, condenser and nitrogen inlet was placed 4,4 diethynyldiphenylether DEDPE 68.4 g, 300 mmol , triethylamine 110 ml and iodobenzene 30.6 g, 150 mmol . The mechanically stirred suspension was warmed in a warm water bath until a homogeneous solution resulted and this solution was deoxygenated with a stream of nitrogen as the solution cooled back to room temperature. The catalysts, bis triphenylphosphine palladium dichloride 52 mg, 0.07 mmol and tris tri phenylphosphine copper I chloride 72 mg, 0.07 mmol , were then added and the resulting mildly exothermic reaction was moderated with a water bath. The white slurry was mechanically stirred for two hours and more catalyst was added equal to the initial amounts and the reaction continued for six hours more. After this time the flask was fitted with a short path distillation head and the excess triethylamine was removed under house vacuum with warming to give a solid residue to which was added methanol 200 ml and the solid was dispersed with stirring. To this vigorously stirred suspension was added water 200 ml over five minutes and 10 aqueous HCl 300 ml over 10 minutes. Upon completion of HCl addition the slurry was stirred an additional 10 minutes and was then suction filtered and the white solid washed with 10 aqueous HCl 200 ml and water 400 ml . The solid was air dried on the filter overnight and was then transferred to a 2000 ml Erlenmeyer flask with the aid of warm isooctane 500 ml . The resulting slurry was brought to a boil and silica gel 20 g and magnesium sulfate 10 g were added and then the hot solution was gravity filtered through a pad of silica gel which was then washed with additional hot isooctane 300 ml . The filtrate was concentrated by rotary evaporation to a cream colored solid, 60.0 g, which was found to be a 55 45 mol mixture of 4 ethynylphenyl 4 phenylethynylphenyl ether and 4,4 diethynyldiphenylether by both NMR and reverse phase chromatographic analysis. 10 g of the tolan capped monomer mixture from the paragraph above assayed to be 45 DEDPE and 55 of the mono tolan capped DEDPE was combined with 3.66 g DEDPE to give a 2 1 mixture of DEDPE to tolan DEDPE 37.4 mmol 18.7 mmol . Phenylacetylene 2.05 ml, 18.7 mmol , nickel acetylacetonate 310 mg, .105 mmol , triphenylphosphine 75 mg, .28 mmol and 15 ml dioxane were all added to a 100 ml round bottomed flask equipped with a heating mantle, overhead stirrer, thermowell, reflux condenser, nitrogen vacuum inlet, vacuum regu lator and reflux condenser. The reaction was monitored for the disappearance of ethynyl by infrared spectro scopy. The reaction was run at 90 C for 7 hours at which time no further reaction appeared to occur. The reaction was diluted with 30 ml dioxane and directly precipitated into 1400 ml methanol. The slurry was filtered and dried overnight in a vacuum oven to yield 13.08 g 84 yield of a polymer with a M In a 1000 ml round bottomed 3 neck flask equipped with reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet, mechanical stirrer and internal thermocouple was placed DEDPE 160 g , PA 7.3 g and diglyme 240 g . The resulting solution was stirred and heated and aliquots were occasionally removed from the solution and their viscosity was determined at room temperature. The solution was maintained at reflux 162 for 120 minutes, gradually cooled to 151 over the next 90 minutes and then maintained at this temperature for an additional 70 minutes until the desired viscosity of 52 cs was obtained. Polymerization was then terminated by simply cooling the solution to room temperature and the material was precipitated by dropwise addition of the diglyme solution into a rapidly stirred ten fold excess of methanol. The solid was collected by filtration and weighed 107 g 65 of theoretical after it was dried in a stream of nitrogen. The dried Thermal Polymer from Example 5 was reformu lated as a 30 by weight solution in NMP N methyl pyrrolidinone having a viscosity of 3.11 x 10 The resulting film was cured on a hot plate under an inert atmosphere in a stepwise fashion 160 to 210 at 5 minute, isothermal at 210 for 60 minutes, 210 to 400 at 10 minute and finally isothermal at 400 for 240 minutes. Examination of the substrate by SEM indicated completely filled trenches and excellent substrate planarization. A 30 to 70 wt solution of an aromatic acetylene oligomer PEPE in an appropriate solvent was prepared. This solution was filtered through a 0.5 µm Fluoropore
