# Governor for internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A speed governor for engine includes a variation removing circuit 500 responsive to an engine rotational speed signal indicative of the rotational speed of a diesel engine 102 to remove a periodical variation component of the signal due to the pulsation of the output torque which the diesel engine generates, from the signal. The period of the variation to be removed by the variation removing circuit changes with the change of the rota tional speed of the engine. The variation removing circuit may be formed of a sample and hold circuit 114 214 or a variable characteristic filter 314 414 of which the suppression frequency is variable.
