## Description
TITLE An Improved High Solids Coating Composition Of A Low Molecular Weight Acrylic Polymer And A Polyisocyanate Cross Linking Agent, And A Substrate Coated Therewith. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is related to high solids coating compositions, in particular, to an improved high solids acrylic polyurethane coating compositions. Acrylic polyurethane coating compositions are well known in the art as shown by VastaU.S. Patent 3,558,564, issued January 26, 1971 Hick U.S. Patent 3,841,895, issued October 15, 1974 and Miller U.S. Patent 3,844,993, issuedOctober 29, 1974. These patents illustrate high quality coating compositions. However, these compositions have a relatively high solvent content to provide for good application properties and good physical properties of the resulting finish.To utilize these compositions in areas which have strict air pollution relgulations, pollution abatement equipment is required. This equipment is expensive, increases capital investment and is costly to operate. Any attempt to reduce the solvent content of these compositions generally results in finishes which have either a poor appearance or unacceptable physical properties or both. Also, it has been found that acrylic polyurethane coating compositions provide an excellent appearance along with depth of color and metallic glamour when a clear or transparent coat of the compositions is applied over a colored or pigmented coat. However, the weatherability and durability of these clear coats have been found to be poor since checking, cracking and flaking of the clear coat occur after relatively short periods of exposure to outdoor weathering, giving the automobile or truck an unsightly appearance. Refinishing of these weathered clear coats is difficult and expensive since to clear coat must be sanded to remove cracked and flaked clear coat before a refinish coat can be applied. There is great need for an acrylic polyurethane coating composition that has a low solvent content and can be utilized without pollution abatement equipment but still provides a high. quality finish that is resistant to outdoor weathering and useful as an exterior finish for automobiles, trucks, and airplanes and as a clear coat color coat finish. The high solids coating composition of tis invention has these desirable characteristics. SULMMARY OF THE INVENTION The improved high solids coating composition comprises at least 50 by weight of a binder of filmforming constituents and up to 50 by weight of a nonaqueous liquid carrier the film form..ina constituents consist essentially of A about 50 95 by weight of an acrylic polymer having a number average molecular weight determined by gel per meation chromotography of about 500 10,000 and preferably 500 4,500, a hydroxyl content of about 2 10 by weight, a glass transition temperature of about 200C to 20cm and containing. about 2 108 by weight of a chain transfer agent, wherein the acrylic polymer consists essentially of an alkyl methacrylate that has 1 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, a hydroxyalkyl acrylate, or a hydroxy alkyl methacrylate each having 2 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, and, optionally, an alkyl acrylate having 2 18 carbons in the alkyl group or styrene and B 5 50 by weight of an organic polyisocyanate cross linking agent the improvement used therewith comprises the inclusion of about 1 20 by weight, based on the weight of the binder of the coating composition, an ultraviolet light stabilizer optionally, the coating composition contains about 1 20 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an ultraviolet light stabilizer and about 0.1 5 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an antioxidant. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVTION The high solids coating composition has a binder content of film forming constituents of at least 50 by weight. Generally, the composition has a binder content of about 60 85 . The remaining constituent in the composition is a liquid carrier which generally is a solvent for the binder.In addition, the composition optionally contains about 0.1 30 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of pigment. The improvement used with the high solids coating composition is the addition to the coating composition of about 1. 20 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an ultraviolet light stabilizer. Optionally, the composition can contain about 1 20 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an ultraviolet light stabilizer and about 0.1 5 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an antioxidant, preferably the weight ratio of ultraviolet light stabilizer to antioxidant is about 1 1 to about 50 1. The binder of film forming constituents used in the coating composition comprises about 50 952 by weight of an acrylic polymer and 5 50 by weight of an organic polyisocyanate cross linking agent.For most uses, the composition contains about 6575 by weight of the acrylic polymer and 25 352 by weight of the organic polyisocyanate cross linking agent. The acrylic polymer utilized in the coating composition is prepared by solution polymerization in which the monomers are blended with a solvent, polymerization catalyst and chain transfer agent and heated to about 75 1500C for 2 6 hours to form a polymer that has a number average molecular weight of about 500 10,000 and preferably about 500 4,500, a hydroxyl content of 2 10 b weight, and a glass transition temperature of about 200C to 200C.Generally, acrylic polymers having a number average molecular weight of about 1,000 3,500 are preferred and used in the composition. Generally, it has been found that to provide a coating composition with good application characteristics, acrylic polymers having a glass transition temperature that is lower than the glass transition temperatures of polymers used in conventional acrylic polyurethane enamels are used. To form films that have acceptable physical properties from low molecular weight acrylic polymers, the polymers must have a hydroxyl content that is about two to three times higher than that of acrylic polymers used for conventional acrylic polyurethane compositions.The higher hydroxyl content provides additional crosslinking sites the films formed have excellent physical properties that are equivalent to and often better than those of films formed from conventional acrylic polyurethane compositions. Both the above number average molecular weight and the weight average molecular weight mentioned hereinafter are determined by gel permeation chromatography. The glass transition temperature of the polymer is determined by dir enential scanning colorimetry or is calculated. One technique that is successfully used in preparing the low molecular weight acrylic polymers is a programmed addition of monomers, solvents, catalyst, solution, and chain transfer agent into a polymerization vessel at a given rate. These programmed additions can be manually calculated or calculated by a computer. This allows for the polymerization of low molecular weight acrylic polymers which are then terminated with the chain transfer agent at the desired low molecular weight.

One preferred combination of ultraviolet light stabilizer and antioxidant is 2 hydroxy 4 dodecyloxybenzophenone or a substituted 2 2 hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole and tetrakismethylene 3 3 ,5 dibutyl 4 hydroxyphenyl proPionate methane. The coating composition of this invention can be applied over a variety of substrates, such as metal, wood, glass, plastics, and the like, by any of the conventional application methods, such as spraying, electrostatic spraying, dipping, brushing, flow coating and the like. The viscosity of the composition can be adjusted for any of these methods by addIng solvents if necessary. Generally, the composition is utilized at a high solids content which keeps air pollution at a minim level. The coatings are baked at relatively low temperatures of about 65 1400C. for about 15 minutes 2 hours. The resulting coating is about 0.1 5 flails thick,buttor most uses, a 1 3 mil thick coating is used. One technique that is used to insure that there will be no popping or cratering of the coating is to allow the solvents to flash off for about 15 30 seconds and longer before a second coating is sprayed on or otherwise applied, then waiting for about 2 10 minutes before baking the coating to allow any residual solvents to flash off. Optionally, the coating can be baked for a short period at a low temperature before a second coating is applied.The resulting coatings have good gloss and can be rubbed or polished with conventional techniques to improve the smoothness or appearance or gloss or both. The coating has good adhesion to substrates of all types, is hard and resistant to weathering, solvents, alkali, scratches and the like. These characteristics make the composition particularly useful as a finish for automobiles, trucks, airplanes, railroad equipment and for the repair of trucks and automobiles. The composition can also be used on appliances, vending machines, outdoor equipment such as bridges, water tanks, gas tanks and the like. When the coating composition is used as a clear coat color coat finish for substrates in which the color coat contains an ultraviolet light stabilizer, it is believed that ultraviolet light stabilizer migrates from the color coat into the clear coat and provides ultraviolet light stabilizer to the clear coat for protection against weathering.Preferably, both the clear coat and the color coat contain ultraviolet light stabilizer and as stabilizer is lost from the clear coat due to weathering, it is replenished from the color coat. The color coat provides a reservoir for the ultraviolet light stabilizer for the clear coat and maintains the stabilizer and antioxidant when used at an effective level that provides protection from weathering. Applicant does not wish to be held to the above theory. Preferred, to form a durable finish, about 5 8 by weight of the ultraviolet light stabilizer is used along with about 0.1 19 by weight of the antioxidant and the ratio of ultraviolet light stabilizer to antioxidant is about 10 1. In a color coat clear coat finish the thickness of the fully cured color coat and clear coat can vary. Generally, the color coat is about 0.4 1.5 mils thick and preferably 0.6 1.0 mils thick and the clear coat is about 0.5 6.0 mils thick and preferably 0.8 1.5 mils thick. The color coat contains pigment in a pigment to binder weight ratio of about 1 100 to about 150 100. Any of the aforementioned conventional pigments used in coating compositions including metallic flake pigments can be used. The clear coat can also contain transparent pigments, i.e., pigments having the same or similar refractive index as the binder of the clear coat and a small particle size of about 0.01550 microns. Typical pigments that can be used in a pigment to binder weight ratio of about 1 100 to 10 100 are inorganic siliceous pigments, such as silica pigments. These pigments have a refractive index of about 1.4 1.6. The clear coat color coat finish can be applied to all types of substrates such as primed or unprimed metal, plastic, rubber, flexible ethylenepropylene copolymer rubbers, flexible polyurethanes, fiberglass reinforced with polyester resins and the like by conventional spraying techniques, Preferably the clear coat is applied to the color coat while the color coat is still wet. Other conventional application techniques as mentioned above can also be used. Under some circumstances it may be desirable to apply the clear coat in the form of a powder and upon baking coalesce the powder into a clear coat color coat finish. Two particularly useful additives for both the color coat and the clear coat are iron pyrophosphate and finely divided silica. Up to about 10 by weight and generally about 0.1 108 by weight based on the weight of the binder, of iron pyrophos phate can be used. Up to about 15 by weight, and generally about 0.5 15 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of finely divided silica can be used. Iron pyrophosphate ana the silica improve overall durability and performance of the finish of this invention. In particular, iron pyrophosphate is a useful additive which provides a synergistic effect of the ultraviolet light stabilizer and antioxidant. Coppo sitions containing the above three constituents have a surprisingly longer period of outdoor weatherability before failure occurs. The longer period is more than the cumulative effect that would be expected of the combination of the three constituents. The following examples illustrate the invention. All parts and percentages are on a weight basis unless other wise specified.

The above clear coat is then applied to each of the above painted panels and air dried for 15 minutes, then baked for 10 minutes at 650C to form a clear coat about 0.8 1.0 mils thick. The above prepared Paint B is sprayed onto six separate sets of four phosphatized steel panels per set and dried and baked as above. The above clear coat is then applied to three sets and clear coat C is applied to the other three. sets and dried and baked as above giving about the same thickness as above. One set of each of the above panels is exposed to 6 months weathering in Florida. Another set of the above panels is exposed to accelerated weathering in a weathering deviceland a third set of the above panels is exposed to a Q.U.V. Weather O Meter . Both sets of panels that contained ultraviolet light stabilizer and antioxidant in the color coat Paint B exhibited substantially less loss of gloss of the finish in comparison to the panels of Paint A under actual and accelerated weathering conditions.
