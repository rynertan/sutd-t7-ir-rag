# Process for preparing thermally stable ammonium nitrate containing granules.

## Abstract
Preparation of ammoniumnitrate containing granules by granulating an ammoniumnitrate melt including 05.5 5 wt of a finely divided, insoluble, inert silica containing material in a fluidized bed of ammonium nitrate seed particles having a temperature between 95 und 145 C. The granules obtained are thermally stable and have a low water content and a high bulk density.
