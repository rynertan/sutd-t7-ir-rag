# A clutch release mechanism for a pull type clutch.

## Abstract
This invention relates to clutch release mechanisms for pull type friction clutches of automobiles having a gearbox with a sleeve 12 surrounding its input shaft 13 . The mechanism comprises a release bearing assembly 22 , a release fork 23 and an automatically connectable and disconnectable coupling 38 operably connecting the re lease fork 23 to the bearing assembly 22 . The coupling 38 is caused to engage or disengage a shoulder 29 on the bearing assembly 22 depending upon the axial position of the gearbox sleeve 12 relative to the coupling 38 so that the coupling is automatically engaged or disengaged as the gearbox is respectively located in its operable position, or is withdrawn.
