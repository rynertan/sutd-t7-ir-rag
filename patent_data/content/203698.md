# Supersensitization of silver halide emulsions.

## Abstract
A silver halide photographic emulsion in a hydrophilic colloidal binder, said emulsion being spectrally sensitized to at least a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and having a supersensitizing amount of a supersensitizing combination selected from the group consisting of 1 an arylmercaptotetrazole and poly ethylacrylate , 2 an arylmercaptotetrazone and a bis triazine 2 ylamino stilbene, 3 poly ethylacrylate and a bis triazine 2 ylamino stilbene, and 4 an arylmercaptotetrazole, a bis triazine 2 ylamino stilbene, and poly ethylacrylate .
