## Description
This invention relates to a process for the production of semiconductor devices. In particular, this invention relates to a process for the production of semiconductor devices which comprise a single crystalline layer of silicon, as an active layer, on a single crystalline layer of insulating materials such as magnesia spinel MgO Al₂O₃ and sapphire α Al₂O₃ . Such an active silicon layer on an insulator or insulating layer is generally referred to in the art as an SOI silicon on insulator , and is used for fabrication of bipolar transistors, metal oxide semiconductor MOS devices, high voltage bipolar integrated circuits IC s , or similar circuits and devices. Many types of SOI s have been proposed and used in the production of semiconductor devices due to the advantages offered by the same. First, they do not necessitate isolation in the devices or, even if isolation is necessary, it is easy to form an isolation area. Further, semiconductor devices having SOI structures show no or little parasitic capacitance. These remarkable advantages ensure the production of semiconductor devices having a high quality and integrity. A typical example of the prior art SOI structure can be found in Figs. 1a and 1b. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the SOI material comprises a 100 Si substrate 1 having deposited thereon an SiO₂ layer 2 and an amorphous Si layer 3. The amorphous Si layer 3 is generally formed by using vapor phase epitaxy VPE or other techniques. In order to convert amorphous Si in the layer 3 to single crystalline Si, the material is annealed at a temperature of about 600 C to 1100 C. Crystallization of the amorphous Si is started at an exposed portion of the Si substrate 1, as is shown in Fig. 1b. Namely, the exposed portion of the substrate 1 acts as a seed for crystallization. The single crystalline Si area 4 gradually extends over the layer 3. Finally, all of amorphous Si in the layer 3 is converted to a single crystalline form of silicon. The result is shown in Fig. 2, which is a schematic plane view of the resulting SOI structure. Unexpectedly, the single crystalline Si layer 4 has partially formed 110 and 111 crystal structures in addition to the 100 crystal structure. This means that the layer 4 is not a single crystalline form, but polycrystalline form. Such an undesirable result can be frequently encountered in the formation of the illustrated SOI structure. Heteroepitaxy is also well known and widely used in the formation of SOI structures. As we have already reported in, for example, M. Ihara et al., Vapor phase epitaxial growth of MgO Al₂O₃ , J. Electrochem. Soc., Vol. 129, No. 11, pp. 2569 2573, Nov. 1982, and M. Ihara, Epitaxial spinel growth for integrated circuits , Microelectronic Engineering, Vol. 1, pp. 161 177, 1983, SOI structures produced by using heteroepitaxy or the heteroepitaxial growth technique have many advantages. For example, the resulting active Si layers on sapphire or spinel show high quality and mobility. High voltage isolation can be achieved. The large sized Si wafers can be used as the substrate, therefore low price devices can be produced. However, this technique suffers from a drawback that the active Si layers have unavoidable stacking faults due to their hetero junction with the underlying sapphire or spinel layer. This defect will become clearer with reference to Fig. 3, which illustrates a typical Si on spinel MgO Al₂O₃ on Si double heterostructure. In Fig. 3, the illustrated SOI structure comprises a 100 single crystalline Si substrate 1 having deposited thereon a 100 oriented spinel epitaxial layer 5 and 100 oriented single crystalline Si layer 6. The Si layer 6 is generally deposited by VPE. During the VPE process, stacking faults 111 are induced in the growing Si layer 6. We found that the formation of the stacking faults is started at limited portions of the Si spinel interface, each of which acts as a core of the fault formation during crystal growth. Such core portions are considered to be due to the about 0.8 lattice mismatch between Si and spinel. In another prior art document US A 4 147 584 there is disclosed a method for producing a wafer using an SOI technique in which a first layer of single crystalline silicon is formed on an underlying layer of 1101 single crystalline insulating material sapphire , which orientation can result in stacking faults. A further prior art document US A 4 046 618 relates to a method of preparing large single crystal thin films with the object of removing limitations of a single crystal substrate used in such a preparation method, not the object of removing the stacking faults problem. The stacking faults result in conspicuous straight defects on the surface of the active Si layer after they have passed through the layer. This means lowering of the yield of the SOI structure and, accordingly, the finally produced devices. It is, therefore, desirable to provide improved methods for forming SOI structures which have thin or thick layers of single crystalline Si with high quality and without stacking faults, on an insulating layer of spinel, sapphire, or other single crystals. According to this invention, there is provided a process for the production of semiconductor devices by using SOI techniques, which process comprises the steps of forming a first layer of single crystalline silicon on an underlying 100 layer of single crystalline insulating material of sapphire or spinel, forming a layer of amorphous silicon on said first layer of silicon at a temperature of 350 C to 650 C, and annealing said layer of amorphous silicon at an annealing temperature of 650 C to 1350 C in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas to form a second layer of single crystalline silicon. The single crystalline insulating material used herein can be optionally selected from the group of insulators conventionally used in the art such as sapphire, magnesia spinel, and the like, depending on the type of the desired device. For example, sapphire can be used in the form of a sapphire substrate, and magnesia spinel can be used in the form of a spinel epitaxial layer on the Si substrate. Epitaxial spinel growth on Si substrate is described in, for example, the M. Ihara references cited above. The crystal orientation of these materials is 100 . The first layer of single crystalline silicon can be epitaxially grown on the surface of the underlying insulator layer. Epitaxial growth of Si is preferably carried out by using conventional VPE techniques. For example, it may be carried out at a temperature of 900 C to 1100 C in a mixed gas of mono silane SiH₄ and hydrogen. The thickness of the first Si layer is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 10 µm. A layer thickness of more than 10 µm should be avoided, since it results in increased size of the stacking faults, although the number of the faults is decreased. The first Si layer has a 100 crystal structure and acts as an interfacial layer between the insulator layer and the active Si layer. After the formation of the first Si layer, a second layer of single crystalline silicon, which has a 100 crystal structure and acts as a buffer layer, is formed on the first Si layer. The Si buffer layer can effectively inhibit elongation of the stacking faults caused in the underlying first Si layer within the buffer layer and, if an active Si layer is formed on the buffer layer, extension of the faults to the active Si layer. As described above, the formation of the second Si layer comprises a series of two steps. First, an amorphous silicon layer is preferably formed on the first Si layer by using conventional VPE techniques at a reaction temperature of 350 C to 650 C in an atmosphere of inert gas such as N₂ , Ar, or He or inert gas based mixed gas which comprises a major amount of inert gas and a minor amount of other gas such as H₂. Monosilane is added to the atmosphere. The formation of the amorphous Si layer in this step can be easily carried out under the above reaction conditions. In the above first step, hydrogen in the mixed gas is effective to prevent the influence of oxygen gas which is contained as impurities in an inert gas. If the impure inert gas has no hydrogen gas, oxygen gas will form silicon dioxide as a result of the reaction with silicon. The amount of hydrogen gas to be added to the inert gas is not critical, but is preferably less than 30 of the total amount of the mixed gas. Further, the reaction temperature of 350 C to 650 C is essential to ensure the formation of amorphous silicon in the above first step. If the reaction temperature is lower than 350 C, the decomposition of monosilane will not be started. Namely, the following reaction is not substantially induced As a second step, the epitaxially grown amorphous silicon on the first Si layer is annealed at a temperature of 650 C to 1350 C in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas with conventional SPE techniques to convert it to single crystalline silicon. The conversion process is also referred to in this art as a recrystallization process. The annealing temperature of 650 C to 1350 C is effective to shorten the time of the recrystallization process and to produce the second single crystalline Si layer having little or no defects. In the formation of the second Si layer, the layer thickness of the amorphous silicon formed in the first step is preferably within the range of 0.01 to 5 µm. A layer thickness of more than 5 µm should be avoided, since it tends to cause polycrystallization of the amorphous silicon during the second step or the subsequent annealing step for recrystallization. In an aspect of this invention, the production process further comprises the step of forming a third layer of single crystalline silicon on the second layer of single crystalline silicon. The third Si layer is generally recognized in this art to he an active Si layer and has a 100 crystal structure, as in the underlying first and second Si layers. The third Si layer can be formed in conventional manners, such as by VPE techniques, frequently used in the formation of single crystalline silicon. For example, it may be epitaxially grown on the second Si layer in a mixed gas of SiH₄ or SiCl₄ and H₂ and at a growth temperature of 900 C to 1100 C. The growth rates of single crystalline Si or active Si are about 0.2 to 3 µm min. The layer thickness of the epitaxially grown Si varies depending on the requirements of the finally produced devices. In another aspect of this invention, a surface of the layer of single crystalline insulating material is pretreated with a solution of 1 to 0.001 g of molybdic acid in 1 ℓ of 30 hydrogen peroxide water, before the deposition of the first Si layer thereon. As a result of pretreatment of the insulator layer, the density of the defects caused in the first Si layer is remarkably decreased and consequently an SOI structure of a high quality is produced. This is because the introduction of a lot of molybdenum cores in the insulator layer results in more complete formation of the first Si layer, i.e., heteroepitaxially grown Si layer, on the insulator layer. In another aspect of this invention, second, two or more single crystalline silicon layers may be formed, thereby increasing the quality of the third Si layer which is subsequently formed on the second Si layer. In other words, the steps of forming the layer of amorphous silicon and annealing it to Form said single crystalline silicon Layer may be repeated two or more times. In still another aspect of this invention, the production process may further comprise the step of forming, before the formation of the third layer of silicon on the second layer of silicon, an additional layer of single crystalline silicon on the second layer of silicon, the additional layer being formed at a growth rate slower than that of the third layer. The formation of the slowly grown single crystalline silicon layer is particularly effective to remove contaminants on the second Si layer, which are induced due to exposure to hydrogen gas during the annealing step and are one factor of increasing stacking faults in the third Si layer to be deposited on the second Si layer. Contaminants partially distributed on the second Si layer are oxygen atoms and the like. The removal step can be easily carried out in comparison with the conventional purification step which comprises etching the second Si layer to a depth sufficient to remove the contaminants. The additional layer of slowly grown silicon can be formed by using conventional VPE techniques as in the formation of the third Si layer described above. In contrast with the growth rates of single crystalline Si for the third Si layer, which rates, as previously described, are about 0.2 to 3 µm min, the growth rates of single crystalline Si for the additional Si layer are generally about 0.01 to 0.2 µm min. The thickness of the additional Si layer of about 0.5 to 2 µm is sufficient to substantially remove the contaminants on the second Si layer. As is apparent from the above description, according to this invention, semiconductor devices which comprise a single crystalline insulator layer, such as spinel or sapphire, having deposited thereon thin or thick single crystalline Si layers with high quality and without stacking faults can be produced with high yields. This invention will be further described with reference to Figs. 4a to 18. First, it should be understood that the insulator used in the practice of this invention is not limited to magnesia spinel, though the drawings are explained referring to the spinel insulator. Referring now to Figs. 4a and 4b, there is illustrated one preferred embodiment of this invention. As is illustrated in Fig. 4a, a single crystalline spinel layer 5 having a thickness of about 1 µm is epitaxially grown on a single crystalline Si substrate 1. A first single crystalline Si layer 7 having a thickness of 0.5 µm is then formed on the spinel layer 5. The formation of the first Si layer 7 is attained with conventional methods, for example, epitaxial growth, at a temperature of 900 C to 950 C and in a mixed gas of monosilane and hydrogen. During the epitaxy process, some defects will be induced in the resulting Si layer, since its lower surface is a hetero interface. In order to obtain the optimum effects of this invention, it is desirable to make the thickness of the first Si layer from 0.01 µm to 10 µm. After the formation of the first Si layer 7, an amorphous Si layer 8 of a thickness of about 0.5 µm is deposited on the layer 7. The deposited amorphous Si layer 8 is then annealed in hydrogen gas at about 1100 C and for about 10 min. Upon annealing, as is shown in Fig. 4b, amorphous silicon in the layer 8 is converted to single crystalline silicon 9. While the prior annealing process is usually carried out in an atmosphere of helium or other inert gases, the annealing process of this invention is carried out in hydrogen gas. We found that stacking faults in the single crystalline Si layer to be deposited on the thus converted single crystalline Si layer 9 are notably decreased if annealing is performed in hydrogen gas. In contrast, annealing in an inert gas results in a lot of stacking faults in the single crystalline Si layer. These differences of the results are demonstrated in Fig. 6a prior art annealing in He and Fig. 6b this invention annealing in H₂ , both of which are photomicrographs x 400 of the single crystalline Si layer showing occurrence and distribution of the faults therein. Figure 6a shows many faults, while Fig. 6b shows decreased faults. Figures 7a and 7b show reflection electron diffraction patterns x 400 of the Si layer before and after annealing or recrystallization, respectively. Figure 7a Photomicrograph for unannealed Si layer 8 in Fig. 4a shows neither spots nor rings. This demonstrates that the unannealed Si layer 8 is an amorphous form. Figure 7b, which is a photomicropraph for annealed Si layer 9 in Fig. 4b, shows some spot like luminance. From these luminances, it is ascertained that Si in the layer 9 is in a single crystalline form. As previously described, the annealing conditions effective to attain remarkable effects of this invention are an atmosphere of hydrogen gas and temperature range of 650 C to 1350 C. Further, Figs. 8a and 8b are SEM photographs x 20,000 of the single crystalline Si layers of Fig. 4b with and without the layer 9, respectively. Figure 8a shows the occurrence and distribution of the faults in the annealed Si layer or single crystalline layer 9. From this photograph, it can be evaluated that the density of faults is on the order of 5 x 10⁴ to 5 x 10⁵ cm ². In contrast, Fig. 8b prior art has conspicuous faults of a density on the order of 10⁸ to 10⁹ cm ². Figure 8b is an SEM photograph of the 1.0 µm thick single crystalline Si layer 7 of Fig. 4b having no layer 9. It is apparent from Figs. 8a and 8b that stacking faults in the single crystalline Si layers are remarkably decreased, if the second amorphous Si layer 8 is first formed on the first single crystalline Si layer 7 and is then recrystallized to the second single crystalline Si layer 9 according to this invention see Figs. 4a and 4b . Figure 5 shows another preferred embodiment of this invention. As is shown in this figure, upon formation of the single crystalline Si layer 9, a third single crystalline Si layer 10 may be formed on the Si layer 9. The Si layer 10 can be VPE grown in hydrogen gas at about 950 C and at a growth rate of 0.85 µm min. The thickness of the epitaxially grown Si layer 10 is about 40 µm. The occurrence and distribution of the faults in the third Si layer 10 are shown in the accompanying drawing, Fig. 9a, which is a photomicrograph taken at 400 magnifications. From this photograph, the fault density of the layer 10 is evaluated to be on the order of 10⁴ to 10⁵ cm ². For comparison purposes, we took a photomicrograph x 400 of the single crystalline Si layer directly grown on the magnesia spinel prior art SOI structure . The photograph of Fig. 9b shows that the prior art Si layer has many faults and its fault density is on the order of 10⁵ to 10⁶ cm ². From these photographs, it is clear that this invention can notably improve the fault density of the Si layers on the spinel. According to another preferred embodiment of this invention, in order to further decrease the fault density, thereby producing a single crystalline Si layer with excellent quality, it is proposed to previously treat a surface of the magnesia spinel layer with a solution of molybdate. Molybdate pretreatment of the spinel layer can be carried out, for example, as follows After the conversion process is completed, a third single crystalline Si layer is epitaxially grown on the second single crystalline Si layer. The formation of the third Si layer can be formed by using a VPE technique under the following conditions atmosphere of mixed gas of monosilane and hydrogen reaction temperature of about 950 C and growth rate of about 0.85 µm min. The thickness of the third Si layer is about 40 µm. The thus produced SOI structure has only few stacking faults. Figure 10a is a photomicrograph x 400 of the third Si layer of the SOI structure, from which photograph the fault density is evaluated to be on the order of 10³ to 10⁴ cm ². In contrast to this, the fault density of the third Si layer produced as in Figs. 4a, 4b, and 5 is determined to be on the order of 10⁴ to 10⁵ cm ² from Fig. 10b, which is a photomicrograph x 400 of the third Si layer. According to still another preferred embodiment of this invention, it is proposed to interpose two or more Si buffer layers or second single crystalline Si layers between the first and third single crystalline Si layers. Unexpectedly, we found that the formation of multiple Si buffer layers is effective to further decrease the fault density of the third Si layer produced in the above described embodiment of this invention, namely, the order of 10³ to 10⁴ cm ². The production process of this embodiment will be described hereinafter with reference to Figs. 11 and 12. As in the last described production process, which includes pretreatment of the spinel layer with nolybdate, a 1 µm thick single crystalline spinel layer 5 is formed on the single crystalline Si substrate 1. The Si substrate 1 with the spinel layer 5 is dipped in a solution of about 0.1 g of molybdic acid in 1 ℓ of about 30 hydrogen peroxide water for about 30 seconds and then dried. After drying, a 0.5 µm thick first single crystalline Si layer 7 is epitaxially grown on the spinel layer 5 in a mixed gas of monosilane and hydrogen at a temperature of about 950 C and at a growth rate of about 0.85 µm min. Thereafter, a 0.5 µm thick amorphous Si layer not shown is epitaxially grown on the first Si layer 7 in a mixed gas of monosilane and nitrogen at a temperature of about 540 C and at a growth rate of about 83 nm min 830 Å min . The amorphous Si layer is then annealed in hydrogen gas at about 1100 C for about 10 minutes. As a result of conversion of amorphous silicon to single crystalline silicon, a second single crystalline Si layer first Si buffer layer 9 is obtained. Further, the above described series of the steps of forming the amorphous Si layer and converting amorphous silicon in the layer to single crystalline silicon is repeated to obtain an additional second single crystalline Si layer second Si buffer layer 19. Finally, a third single crystalline Si layer 10 is epitaxially grown on the second Si buffer layer 19 in a mixed gas of monosilane and hydrogen at a temperature of about 950 C and at a growth rate of about 0.85 µm min. The thickness of the deposited third Si layer 10 is about 40 µm. The thus produced SOI structure shows significantly decreased fault density. Its fault density is on the order of 10² to 10³ cm ² and is evaluated from Fig. 13a, namely, the photomicrograph 400 x of the third Si layer of the SOI structure. For comparison purposes, another photomicrograph x 100 of the third Si layer of the SOI structure which is identical with that of Fig. 11, except for the omission of the second Si buffer layer 19, is shown in Fig. 13b. The fault density of the third Si layer of the latter SOI structure, as described above, is on the order of 10³ to 10⁴ cm ². Effects of the duplicated Si buffer layers 9 and 19 will be further clarified with reference to Fig. 12, which is a graph showing a density of stacking faults as a function of Si thickness from the interface between the spinel layer 5 and the first Si layer 7. The solid line I and dotted line II correspond to Figs. 13a and 13b, respectively, and points A, B, C, and D each indicates an interface between two adjacent layers. In contrast to the single Si buffer layer Line II , the duplicated Si buffer layers Layers 9 plus 19 Line I indicate shaply decreased fault density. In another preferred embodiment of this invention, it is also proposed to interpose an additional slowly grown single crystalline Si layer between the second Si buffer layer and the third Si layer. This process is effective to further decrease the fault density of the third Si layer of the molybdate pretreated spinel layer containing SOI structure described above, namely, the order of 10³ to 10⁴ cm ². Details of this process will be described hereinbelow with reference to Fig. 14. As in the previously described production of the molybdate pretreated spinel layer containing SOI structure, a 1 µm thick single crystalline spinel layer 5 is formed on a single crystalline Si substrate 1. The Si substrate 1 with the spinel layer 5 is dipped in a solution of about 0.1 g of molybdic acid in 1 ℓ of about 30 hydrogen peroxide water for about 30 seconds and then dried. After drying, a 0.5 µm thick first single crystalline Si layer 7 is epitaxially grown on the spinel layer 5 in a mixed gas of monosilane and hydrogen at a temperature of about 950 C and at a growth rate of about 0.85 µm min. Thereafter, a 0.5 µm thick amorphous Si layer not shown is epitaxially grown on the first Si layer 7 in a mixed gas of monosilane and nitrogen at a temperature of about 540 C and at a growth rate of about 83 nm min 830 Å min . The amorphous Si layer is then annealed in hydrogen gas at about 1100 C for about 10 minutes. As a result of conversion of amorphous silicon to single crystalline silicon, a second single crystalline Si layer 9 is obtained. Then, an additional 2 µm thick single crystalline Si layer 11 is epitaxially grown on the second Si layer 9 in a mixed gas of monosilane and hydrogen at about 950 C and at a slow growth rate of about 0.1 µm min. As a result, impurities, for example, oxygen atoms, which partially occur on the surface of the second Si layer 9 and adversely affect the quality of the epitaxially grown Si crystal on the layer 9 are removed. Finally, a third single crystalline Si layer 10 is epitaxially grown on the additional Si layer 11 in a mixed gas of monosilane and hydrogen at a temperature of about 950 C and at a growth rate of about 0.85 µm min. The thickness of the deposited third Si layer 10 is about 40 µm. The thus produced SOI structure shows significantly decreased fault density. Its fault density is on the order of 10² to 10³ cm ² and is evaluated from Fig. 15a, namely, the photomicrograph x 400 of the third Si layer of the SOI structure. For comparison purposes, another photomicrograph x 100 of the third Si layer of the SOI structure, which is identical with that of Fig. 14 except for omission of the additional Si layer 11, is shown in Fig. 15b. The fault density of the third Si layer of the latter SOI structure, as described above, is on the order of 10³ to 10⁴ cm ². In the production process described above, the additional Si layer 11 is epitaxially grown in a mixed gas of monosilane and hydrogen. However, in addition to this mixed gas, it is also possible to use a mixed gas of hydrogen and silicon tetrachloride or dichlorsilane or a mixed gas of said mixed gas and hydrogen chloride. The growth temperature and growth rate are preferably 950 C to 1150 C and 0.01 to 0.2 µm min, respectively. Further, as previously described, the formation of the third Si layer 10 can be preferably carried out in a mixed gas of monosilane and hydrogen. Similarly, other gases conventionally used in this field, for example, silicon tetrachloride and dichlorsilane, may be used to obtain satisfactory results. Furthermore, it was found from experiments that the epitaxial growth of amorphous silicon can be preferably carried out at a growth temperature of 350 C to 650 C and at a growth rate of 2 to 200 nm min 20 to 2000 Å min . Figures 16, 17, and 18 are schematic cross sectional views showing the SOI structures with well etched Si substrates according to this invention. Since Figs. 16, 17, and 18 correspond to Figs. 5, 11, and 14, we will omit detailed descriptions of these drawings.
