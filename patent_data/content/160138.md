# Fast crystallizing polyethylene terephthalate compositions.

## Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate molding compositions char acterized by rapid crystallization are provided by combining polyethylene terephthalate and a filler or reinforcing agent with a crystallization rate promotor comprising sodium benzoate and a poly alpha olefin such as low density polyethylene. A flame retardant material is provided by the addition of flame retardant additives.
