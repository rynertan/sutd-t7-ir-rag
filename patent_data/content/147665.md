# Nucleic acid probe, test method and reagent system for detecting a polynucleotide sequence and antibody therefor.

## Abstract
A nucleic acid detection probe comprising a hybridizable single stranded portion of nucleic acid connected with a non hybridizable, single or double stranded nucleic acid portion, the non hybridizable portion preferably including a recognition site for binding by a particular protein. Such recognition site can be a region of singly or doubly stranded nucleic acid specific for a particular nucleic acid binding protein such as lac repressor protein or can be a modified nucleic acid region such as a unique antigenic determinant introduced by interaction of the region with a modifier compound such as an intercalating agent or a platinium containing ligand. The probe binding protein can be labeled for ease of detection and in the case of an antigenic determinant binding site can be labeled antibody.
