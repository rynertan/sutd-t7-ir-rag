# Method of fabricating alumina doped silica fibres using organometallic compounds.

## Abstract
The method allows the production of silica and dopant with reactions among gaseous chemical compounds. The optical fibres produced do not present dip and exhibit low attenuation. Carbon dioxide is used as an oxidizer and organometallic aluminum compounds are used to obtain the dopant silica is obtained from organometallic silicon com pounds or silicon tetrachloride.
