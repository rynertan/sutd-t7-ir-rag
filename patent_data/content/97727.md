# Pipe connection.

## Abstract
A pipe connection, and method for forming said connec tion, wherein one pipe 2 is connected at an angle to the side of a second pipe 4 , said connection forming a structural joint and not a flow passage a first pipe 2 has a cylindrical opening 12 formed in its side while a second pipe has one end contoured to fit against the side of said first pipe over said opening said second pipe has a locking member 8 fixed to the interior thereof with a projection 10 which fits into the opening in said first pipe 2 with said projection having a stem 14 extending therefrom having an enlarged head 16 which projects into the interior of said first pipe a holding clip 18 is positioned between the underside of said enlarged head 16 and the inner surface of said first pipe forcing the contoured end of said second pipe against the side of said first pipe. When the pipe material used in PVC, ABS, or any other plastic with similar characteristics of resiliency and bondability, the diametrical contour at the end of said second pipe 4 is formed having a diameter which is slightly smaller than that of the first pipe.
