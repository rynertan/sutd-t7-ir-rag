## Description
A METHOD OF ENHANCING NEUROFIBER REGROWTH BACKGROUND OF THE INVETION Nerve repair, or neurorrhaphy, has been do,t sinLe the l9th century. The use of the operative microsco e in such surgery was introduced in 192 by Nyland. Microsurgical techniques are quite advanced. Despite this, the prognosis for an individual patient is difficult to give accurately.It is well known that many factors, such as the patient s age, the cause of injury, the associated injuries, the extent and type of nerve injury, the location of transsection high or low , the timing of the repair and the technique of repair all effect the end result after nerve repair neuro rrhaphy . The search for better suture materi ls, scar preventing techniques and an answer to the epineural versus perineural repair controversy still continues. See, for instance, Terzis, Neural Microsurgery , Reconstructive Microsurgern, edited by.Daniel, and Terzis, Little, Brown andCompany, Boston, 1977, pp. 295 478 Bora, NerveResponse to Injury and Repair, Rehabilitation of the Hand, edited by Hunter, et. al., The C.V. Nosby Company, St. Louis, 1978, pp. 269 272 andCabaud, et. al., J.P. Hand Surgery 1 131 137, 1976.It is still conceded by most authorities that excellent results after neurorrhaphy still cannot be consistently obtained. The state of art is best summarized by Terzis, in spite of the recent introduction of higher magnification, finger sutures, smaller instruments and refinement of surgical techniques, the improvement in the overall r c uit o peripheral nerve repairs in the last 100 years as determined by the return of function has been hardly measurable. Terzis, J. Hand Surgery, 1 52 66, 1976 . Thus, any adjunctive therapy which could improve the present results would be extremely useful. Our invention comprises an adjunctive therapy which enhances neurofiber regrowth in mammals after neurorrhaphy. Leupeptin was identified in culture filtrate of actinomycetes by Umezawa and co workers. Aoyagi et. al., J. Antibiotics, 22 283 286, 1969 and Kondo, et. al., Chem. Pharm. Bull , 17 1896 1901, 1969 . This compound is a mixture of two major constituents, acetyl L leu L leu L argininal and propionyl L leu L leu L argininal. It was further found that either of the L leu components may be replaced by L isoleucine L isoleu or L valine L val . Kawamure, et. al., Chen Pharm. Bull., 17 1902 1909, 1969 . The aldehyde group present at the C terminal position is considered to be very important for its potent biological inhibitory activity. Leupeptin has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of trypsin, plasmin, kaleikrein, thrombokinase and papain.It has also been established that cathespinB, cathespin L, and calcium activated neutral protease are also inhibited by leupeptin in muscle, squid axoplasm and rat sciatic nerve. Recently, it has been reported that leupeptin was successfully used in vivo as an inhibitor of denervation induced atrophy in chicken pectoralis muscle. Stracher et. al., Exp. Neurol., 66 611 618, 1979 . Unpublished work by Stracher indicates that the material which was used to carry out these studies was substantially pure i.e. about 98 by high performance liquid chromatography acetyl L leu L leu argininal. lt hav beer further irdicajted that the nature of the blocking group, at this terminal leucine or its replacement amino acid is irrevelart, any naturally occuring or synthetic non toxic amine blocking group could be used. For example, propionyl or benzoyl groups could be used just as well. This designation not being intended to be critical or limiting. Furthermore, investigations in chicken and rat skeletal and fetal heart preparations that leupeptin decreased protein degradation while having no effect on protein synthesis. Libby, et. al.,Science, 199 3 534 536, 1978 Libby and Coldberg,Am. J. Physiol., 231 441, 1976 and Libby, et.al., Cell, 19 481 491, 1980 . In addition it has been concluded that leupeptin acts selectively without producing toxic effects or adverse immunogenic reactions. Umezawa, H.

More particularly, this invention relates to a method of enhancing neurofiber regrowth in mammals which comprises administering a neurofiber regrowth enhancing amount of leupeptin in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In view of the unclarity of prior nomenclature some clarification in this specification is desirable.Thus, where the term leupeptin is used hereinafter and in the claims, it shall be intended to define a compound selected from the group having the formula B A1 A L argininal wherein B is any pharmacologically acceptable amine blocking group suitably acetyl, propionyl or benzoyl but not limited thereto, A1 and A2 are amino acids selected from the group consisting of L leucine,L valine and L isoleucine. The term 1leupeptin , when used per se shall also include mixtures of any compounds falling within the above definition. Where the term leupeptin is used with prefixes only, the prefixes shall indicate the nature of the blocking group thus Ac, Pr and Bz shall designate the blocking groups acetyl, propionyl and benzoyl. When used with a prefix and no suffix the term leupeptin shall mean L leu L leu L argininal.Thus, Ac leupeptin means acetyl L leu L leu L argininal.Similarly, suffixes shall indicate the changes in the first two amino acids thus, leupeptin LV means L leu L Val L argininal. Leupeptin LI means L leu L isoleu L argininal.Leupeptin VI means L Val L isoleu L argininal. Leupeptin VL means L val L leu L argininal.Leupeptin IV means L isoleu L val L argininal. Leupeptin VV means L val L val L argininal.Leupeptin II means L isoleu L isoleu L argininal. Leupeptin IL means L isoleu L leu L argininal. Similarly, the prefix Ac, Pr or Bz indicates the nature of the blocking group. Thus, Ac leupeptinLV means acetyl L leu L val L argininal. According to the preont invention, it has now been found that leupeptin can be utilized to enhance neurofiber regrowth in mammals after micro surgical neurorrhaphy. While the effectiveness of Ac leupeptin hat been demonstrated after surgical severence of neurofibers, its utility is not limited to its use after microsurgical neurorrhaphy since its ability to regenerate neurofibers depends on its enhancement of growth of unmyelinated axonal sprouts. Thus, leupeptin may be used for this purpose in neuro degenerative disorders such as spinal muscular atrophies such as Kugelbeg Weylander Disease and Werdnig HoffmanDisease peripheral neuropathies such as CharcotMarie Tooth Disease and Peroneal Atrophy, AmyotrophicLateral Sclerosis, Polio myelites, Guillain Barre disease, Spinal Trauma, Diabetic Neuropathy, Com pression type nerve injuries such as endopathic neurapathy, neuropraxia and traction nerve injuries. In order to achieve most efficient use of leupeptin it is desirable to provide it to the injured site as rapidly as possible. Hence, for example, in a micro surgical neurorraphy situation it is desirable to initially encourage unmyelinated axonal sprouting as rapidly as possible. Hence, the repair site should be bathed in a leupeptin solution. Since leupeptin is substantially non toxic the strength of the solution is not critical. A solution of leupeptin or its salts or in a saline solution suitably phosphate buffered saline in generally pharmacological accepted strength, may contain between 5 and 20 by weight preferably between about 10 and 15 by weight of leupeptin. In non surgical or post surgical situations administration may be parenteral or subcutaneous by injection or infusion. Long term administration of leupeptin may suitably be provided by oral administration as a solution, suspension, elixir, tablet, or capsule. When administered by injection the carrier, suitably physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline, may contain between 5 to 20 suitably 10 to 15 by weight of leupeptin or its salts.When administered orally in the form of capsules or tablets said capsules or tablets may contain between about 200 to about 500 milligrams of the active substance per unit of dose, however this formulation should not be considered to be critical but merely a matter of convenience. The total amount administered per day depends upon the opii.of the treating physician but may lie between 400 ,000 milligrams per day for the average human adults Leupeptin may be utilized per se or in the form of any of its pharmaceutically acceptable acid derived salts.Among the suitable acids may be mentioped inorganic or organic acids, suitably hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, butyric acid, benzoic acid, nicotinic acid, tartaric acid, glucose l phosphoric acid, embonic acid and ethane sulfoflic acid. The foregoing acids are recited for purposes of illustration and should no way be considered to be critical or limiting. Leupeptin is commercially available as theAc leupeptin hemi sulfate and therefore it would be expected to be utilized in this form or in the form of the hydrochloride or salt. The enchancement of neurofiber regrowth activity of leupeptin in mammals after microsurgical neurorrhaphy is demonstrated by the results of testing in the following procedures. lwenty rat are anesthetiz c with rompun 0.5 cc total volume . The right sciatic nerve is exposed and severed with microneuroscissors, and subsequently repaired microsurgically with 6 B circumferential microsutures using 10 0 nylon.Immediately following surgery the treated animals receive 12 mg kg Ac leupeptin in 5 DMSO dimethyl sulphoxide as a bath on their sciatic nerve, 0.25 cc. total volume. Then the treated animals are injected intramuscularly in right hindlimb with 0.25 cc of a solution containing 12 mg kg Ac leupeptin in 5 DMSO. Control animals receive the same surgical treatment, but the bath and intramuscular injection consist only of the solvent and 5 DMSO. Thereafter, treated animals are injected twice weekly in the operated hindlimb with 12 mg kg Ac leupeptin in 5 DMSO 0.25 cc total volume for periods of 1 week, 1 month, two months, three months and six months. Control animals are injected with 0.25 cc of 5 DMSO twice weekly in the operated hindlimb for the same time period. Two treated and two control animals are assigned to each of the stated time periods. All animals are sacrified by an overdose of pentobarbital, 1.0 cc total volume. The gastrocnemius, soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles of the operated hindlimb are execised from origin to insertion, weighed and then frozen in isopentane in liquid nitrogen at 20 C. For light microscopy, cryostat sections are cut, placed on slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and orATPase histochemistry at pH s of 4.3 and 10.4.Myofiber diameters are determined by photographing hematoxylin and eosin sections at a constant magnification in the light microscope. A ten mm. portion of the repaired sciatic nerve is excised from each animal. This is fixed in 3.0 glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3, overnight for electron microscopy. After post fixation in 1.0 osmium tetroxide, ethanol dehydration and embedding in Polybed 812, both thick 1 micron and thin 500 AO transverse sections are cut on a ultramicrotome. Portions of the excised muscles receive similar preparation for electron microscopy. Thick sections of the sciatic nerve are placed on microscope slots stained with toluidine blue and photographed at a constant magnification in the light microscope. Thin sections of both nerve and muscles are placed on 300 mesh copper grid calm, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and photographed using a Hitachi HU 12 electron microscope. The results of the above testing are given in the following tables I V. TABLE I Average Wet Weight g of Muscles E.D.L.

In summary, the test results shown in tables 1 V indicate that leupeptin significantly enhances neurofiber regrowth in mammals after microsurgical neurorrhaphy. In view of its potent pharmacological property, leupeptin can be combined with pharmaceutical carriers and administered in a variety of well known pharmaceutical forms suitable for parenteral or oral administration to provide a composition useful in the enhancement of neurofiber regrowth in mammals. Based upon laboratory tests, the effective dose EDso of leupeptin will typically be in the range of about 8 to about 75 mg kg, and preferably about 10 50 mg kg, of mammalian weight administered in single or divided doses. The exact dose to be administered is dependent upon the age, weight and particular conditions of the individual involved. The compositions containing the compounds of this invention will preferably contain from about 12 mg kg of the leupeptin per dosage unit.Said compositions may be administered orally but are most preferably administered parenterally near the affected area. Typical formulations are those such as solutions, suspensions, elixirs, syrups, tablets, or capsules. Typical acceptable pharmaceutical carriers for use.in formulations described above are exemplified by sugars, such as lactose, sucrose, manitol, and sorbitol starches such as corn starch, tapioca starch and potato starch cellulose and derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethylcellulose and methylcellulose polyvinylpyrrolidone polyvinyl alcohol stearic acid, vegetable oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil and corn oil non ionic cationic and anionic surfactants ethylene glycol polymers water saline as well as other non toxic compatible fillers, binders, disintegrants and lubricants commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both of materials and methods, may be practiced without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
