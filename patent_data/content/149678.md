## Description
Generally speaking, an optical integrated circuit is constructed of a complicated combination of structures, as shown in Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings. On a substrate of, for example , gadolinium gallium garnet GGG 1, more specifically, an optical waveguide layer of, for example, yttrium iron garnet YIG 2 which has a higher refractive index than that of the substrate 1 is formed, and optical waveguide strips called ridges 3 are formed thereon. Light is transmitted through the ridges so that, when two ridges are provided adjacent to each other, as shown in Fig. 1, all the optical energy of the light propagating through ridge 3 1 is transferred to ridge 3 2 within a coupling length that is determined by the shape, refractive index, etc., of the ridges. In this case, transfer to the ridge 3 2 can be prevented by placing magnets 4 1, 4 2 which apply magnetic fields to the ridges on the tops of the ridges, as shown in Fig. 2 a of the accompanying drawings, and by controlling the intensities of the magnetic fields thereof so that the light propagating through the ridge 3 1 can emanate from an output terminal for the ridge 3 1. It is customary to use serpentine coils i.e., wound coils instead of the magnets to control the magnetic fields. In this case, it is difficult to form the coils directly onto the ridges, and a flat medium must be formed on the ridges before the coils can be formed on the flat medium. On the other hand, when the substrate 1 is made of an electro optical crystal e.g., gallium arsenide, GaAs and the optical waveguide layer 2 is made of an electro optical crystal which has a higher refractive index than that of the first crystal e.g., GaAs with a higher resistance , electrodes 5 1 and 5 2 are attached to the tops of the ridges, as shown in Fig. 2 b of the accompanying drawings, and an electrode 6 is attached to the bottom of the substrate so that the transfer of light can be prevented by a control of the voltage between the two terminals. This is the principle of an optical switch within an optical integrated circuit. The former type of switch employs a magneto optical effect whereas the latter employs an electro optical effect. Generally speaking, an optical integrated circuit makes use of the electro magnetic effect. Fig. 1 shows the simplest case thereof, but an optical integrated circuit usually has a complicated shape. For Example, the optical integrated circuit can have a construction such as that shown in Fig. 3 of the accompanying drawings. A problem with a complicated optical integrated circuit which has such curved optical waveguides concerns how much the optical transmission losses can be reduced. A special problem is losses due to optical scattering. These scattering losses are partly caused by irregularities due to thermal fluctuations in the material making up the optical waveguides, and partly by the structure of the optical waveguides themselves. The former type of scattering is determined by the material, and results in a loss of about 0.8 dB km for an optical wavelength of 1 µm, which is so small that it can be neglected in an optical integrated circuit. However, the latter type of scattering varies so much according to the method by which optical waveguides are manufactured that it raises a very serious problem. In order to form the ridges, a wet etching method or a dry etching method is usually used. In the wet etching method, the desired portions of the YIG or the like are etched with hot phosphoric acid and in the dry etching method, the desired portions of the YIG are mechanically etched by argon ions Ar striking the YIG. The sides of the ridges prepared by these methods are irregular, as indicated at 7 in Fig. 4 of the accompanying drawings. These irregularities 7 are caused by unevenness in the etching and the material used, or by irregularities in the photo mask used to form the ridges. The light propagating through the ridges is scattered optically by the irregularities of their sides, so that an optical transmission loss results. This optical transmission loss α is more or less proportional to n₁² n₃² , where n₁ is the refractive index of the ridges and n₃ is the refractive index of the surrounding medium, and is strongly influenced by the period of the irregularities in the ridge sides. These irregularities in the ridge sides are currently about 0.08 µm. The resultant optical loss at the straight portions of the ridges is equal to or less than 1 dB cm. The reason for this low transmission loss is that the penetration of optical energy i.e., the electrical field distribution E propagating through the ridges to the outside is small at the straight portions, as shown in Fig. 5 of the accompanying drawings, so that the irregularities in the ridge sides have only a small effect. As shown in Fig. 5, however, there is a large penetration of optical energy i.e., the electrical field distribution E to the outside at the curved portions, so that the irregularities in the ridge sides have a strong effect and increase the optical scattering. In order to make the influence of the irregularities more apparent, optical integrated circuits were fabricated by making each substrate 1 of Ga At present, the coating of MOS integrated circuits is prepared by sputtering SiO₂ or the like Rib waveguide switches with MOS electro optic control for monolithic integrated optics in GaAs Aℓ It is known from JP A 51 88041 to provide an optical integrated circuit in which an optical waveguide region is formed on a substrate, of higher refractive index than the substrate 1 and of electro optic material, which optical waveguide region has a plurality of ridges for enabling the confined transmission of light through the optical waveguide region. An insulating layer extends over the optical waveguide region including the ridges, which insulating layer is a hardened film of heat resistant and high molecular resin. Thus, this document corresponds to the pre characterising part of claim 1. A generally similar structure is also known from GB A 2000877. The optical integrated circuit according to the present invention is as defined in claim 1. Thus, the present invention proposes that there is an electrode on each ridge for changing the refractive index of the ridge, the electrode being covered by the insulating layer except at the location where they contact a corresponding electrode stripe. Furthermore, there is a plurality of electrode stripes 10 on the insulating layer 9 , in electrical contact with the electrodes 5 1, 5 2 , the electrode stripes extending transversely to the ridges. However, in order to ensure that the electrode stripe is not broken on its passage over the ridges, the present invention further requires that the insulating layer has a thickness not less than 200 nm, is deposited in the liquid form, and has undulations with a slope sufficiently small for reducing the failure rate of the electrode stripes. Embodiments of the invention will now be described in detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 7 is a view of one embodiment of the present invention, and shows a section through the structure of part of an optical integrated circuit in which a 200 nm thick, hardened film of polyimide resin, e.g., polyimideisoindroquinazolindion abbreviated to PII hereinafter is used as a coating layer 8 over an optical waveguide layer 2 of a refractive index of 3.4, which is formed on a GaAs substrate 1 and has GaAs ridges 3 1 and 3 2. The PII film 8 is provided, after electrodes 5 1 and 5 2 are formed on the ridges 3 1 and 3 2, by the application of a liquid prepared by dissolving predetermined quantity of PII in a solvent e.g., a 1 1 mixture of N methyl 2 pyrolidone and N, N dimethylacetamide by a rotary application method, and by a subsequent heat treatment to effect hardening. The thickness of the PII film 8 thus obtained can be determined by the concentration of the PII and the speed of the rotary application. If the PII has a concentration of 8 by weight and the speed is 3,500 rpm, the PII film has a thickness of 300 nm after the heat treatment. If a heat treatment at 350 C for 1 hour, for example, is conducted after the application of the PII film, it is hardened to provide a film that has suitable characteristics for a coating layer of an optical integrated circuit. Since the PII is applied by rotary application of a solution, it completely covers the ridge irregularities and provides very little deformation, even after it has been hardened, so that it completely coats the ridge irregularities. As shown in Fig. 8, PII has such an excellent optical transmissivity in the wavelength range of above 0.5 µm that the transmission losses of the light are so small that they can be virtually neglected. A PII film has the feature that its refractive index is as much as about 1.72, which is close to those of LiNbO₃, GaAs, YIG, etc. In other words, the above conditions set for the coating film are completely satisfied. The use of this PII film for curved ridges, as shown in Fig. 6, has revealed that transmission losses are reduced by about 86 to 9 dB cm at a radius of curvature of 0.5 mm. Thus the PII film has the advantage that optical transmission losses can be greatly reduced. A more detailed investigation has revealed the following. Lead wiring patterns must be formed over an optical integrated circuit so that optical control currents can flow through the individual ridges. An example of a simple structure thereof is shown in Fig. 9. When the electrode of the ridge 3 2 is controlled, electrode strips 10 must be arranged over an insulating layer 9 on the electrodes 5 1 and 5 3. This is usually done by using a lift off process. In a conventional optical integrated circuit, a structure is employed in which the electrode strips 10 are attached directly, not over the insulating layer 9 as shown in Fig. 10, after the ends of the electrodes 5 1 and 5 3 are partially removed or a structure is used in which the electrode strips 10 are attached to the ridges over the insulating layer 9, as shown in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9, however, portions of the ridges are formed to have abrupt steps, which make it very difficult to prepare the electrode strips 10 by lift off. If the insulating layer 9 has steep steps, as shown in Fig. 9, these steep steps could induce breakage or thinning of the electrode strips 10 so that they could be fused by the heat generated therein, and unwanted portions cannot be removed by the lift off process, greatly reducing the reliability thereof. Since this problem due to the steps becomes even more prominent as the integration of the optical integrated circuit increases, it is absolutely necessary to form the highly integrated circuit so that the insulating layer 9 is flat. Recently, ridge patterns have been formed by ion milling so that the patterns can be made even smaller the slope of the ridge sides in this case is about 80 degrees, close to perpendicular. As a result, the steps are further enlarged. As shown in Fig. 10, therefore, the method of attaching the electrode strips 10 directly to the ridges is inappropriate for forming a highly integrated circuit. This makes it necessary to adopt the construction of Fig. 9 using the insulating layer 9. PII film is excellent, not only in its optical characteristics, but also in its electrical insulation properties. The height of the ridges 3 1 and 3 2 is between 200 nm to 1,500 nm, so that if a film of SiO₂ of the same thickness of 200 nm as that of the PII film is used as the insulating layer, therefore, the steep steps of Fig. 9 are formed, and these reduce the connectability of the electrode strips 10. If the insulating film is made of PII, however, any irregularities in the surface of the PII film can be reduced and flattened, because PII solution is a liquid. Accordingly, if the PII is left to settle for a predetermined period of time after it has been applied by rotary application or another method, the steps in the surface of the PII film 9 due to the ridges 3 1 and 3 2 are greatly reduced and flattened, so that any steps in the electrode strips 10 are much smaller than those of Fig. 9. In the present invention, the thickness of the PII film 8 over the tops of the ridges also plays an important role. If the PII film 8 is too thin, the effect of reducing the steps is insufficient, which can reduce the insulation between the electrode 5 1 and the electrode strips 10 in the worst case. If the slope of the stepped portions when the ridges have a height of 350 nm, for example, is ϑ as shown in Fig. 11, the slope ϑ becomes smaller as the thickness h of the PII film increases, as shown in Fig. 12. When the slope is less than 30 degrees, the electrode strips are not cut. For this reason, the thickness of the PII film must be at least 200 nm. If the thickness h of the PII film 8 is less than 200 nm, moreover, the insulation provided thereby is insufficient. This is why the thickness h of the PII film 8 must be at least 200 nm. In order to control the magnetic fields within the optical integrated circuit, on the other hand, it is necessary to form serpentine coils on the PII film to apply the magnetic fields to the ridges. If, in this case, the thickness h of the PII film is increased, the strength of the magnetic fields thus applied is reduced. Therefore the film thickness is desirably less than 1,000 nm. A large number of heat resistant, high molecular resins are available and which can be used in the present invention because they satisfy the above conditions. In addition to polyimides such as PII, for example, epoxy resins, phenol resins, polyamide imide resins, etc., can be used. Two or more of these resins can be combined. The present invention makes it possible to provide an optical integrated circuit which has low loss optical waveguides. The employment of this optical integrated circuit can improve the performance and reduce the size and weight, as well as cost, of circuits transmitting various signals, and also various apparatuses related to these transmission techniques. It is, therefore, obvious that the optical integrated circuit of the present invention has an extremely high utility value.
