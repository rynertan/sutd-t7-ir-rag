# Separation of materials from a liquid dispersion by sedimentation.

## Abstract
Sedimentation classification of particulate material in liquid dispersion. The dispersion is centrifuged in a tubular vessel comprising at least two neighbouring compartments communicating via at least one opening which may be cap illary. The lowermost compartment has a sealed bottom and the uppermost has an open upper end. Upon completion of the centrifugation a liquid fraction with dispersed particu late material is decanted from the uppermost compartment. Useful products may also be recovered from other com partments.
