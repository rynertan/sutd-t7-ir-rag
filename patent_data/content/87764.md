# Josephson pulse generator of current injection type.

## Abstract
A pulse generator circuit of the current injection type using Josephson junctions is disclosed which comprises a first group of N two or more resistors R₁₁, R₁₂ having their one ends connected together to a gate current source and having their other ends each connected to a reference potential via N Josephson junctions J₁₁, J₁₂ and intercon nected by a second group of N 1 resistors R₂₁ , with two further Josephson junctions J₂, J₃ being connected in series in front and behind, respectively, of said second group of resistors R₂₁ and having their other ends connected to said reference potential via further resistors R
