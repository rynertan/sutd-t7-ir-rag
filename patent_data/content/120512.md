Such oils are known from British patent specifications 1,161,188 and 1,154,966. The polymers described in this literature are linear polymers and although they show an excellent pour point depressing and flow improving effect, it has nw been found that a still better pour point depressing, and flow improving effect can be obtained, in particular at low concentrations, if these polymers have a branched backbone. This invention therefore relates to the above mentioned crude oils or fuel oils, characterized in that the polymer has a branched backbone. Such a polymer is especially suitable for depressing the pour point of crude oils and fuel oils containing at least 3 w of waxes with a melting point above 350C and a boiling point above 3500C such as the crude oils described in British patent specification 1,161,188 and the fuel oils described in British patent specification 1,154,966.

Suitable monomers C are polyesters of alkanepolyols, such as diols, triols and tetraols, and unsaturEted monocarboxylic acids, such as alkanediol di meth acrylates, trimethylolpropane tri meth acrylate and pentaerythritol tetra meth acrylate. Suitable polyols have 1 to 12 carbon atoms, such as ethanediol, propane diol, butanediol, in particular 1,4 butanediol polyvinyl com pounds, such as divinyleseers of saturated or unsaturated dicar Ex sylic acids such as succinic, maleic, fumaric and itaconic acids and polyvinyl aromatic compouds, in particular divinyl benzene.These and otter suitable monomers C are described in British patent specification 1,575,507.
