# PCM signal recording reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A digital signal recording reproducing apparatus capable of recording and reproducing digital signals having differ ences in respect to sampling frequency thereof and the number of quantization bits per sample by means of a com mon circuit arrangement includes means 30 for varying revolution speed of rotating heads 7, 7 for recording and reproduction or travelling speed of a recording medium 9 as a function of different sampling frequencies. A signal proces sing circuit 13 for processing the digital signals so as to be suited for the recording on the recording medium 19 is controlled by a clock signal 18 of which frequency is changed in dependence on the different sampling frequencies 17, 27, 28 . The signal processing circuit is arranged so that PCM data contained in a frame is constituted by a number of bits which is equal to a common multiple of the different quantization bit numbers 16 bits and 12 bits and added with a common frame synchronizing signal and common error detection and correc tion codes to thereby prepare the PCM signal of the frame arrangement. The digital signals which differ in the sampling frequency and the quantization bit numbers can be recorded by same recording and reproducing apparatus with an improved efficiency with a same wavelength and in a same signal format.
