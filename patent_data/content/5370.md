## Description
ELECTRICAL CORRECTOR This invention relates to electrical connectors which can be removed from a terminal by applying a small force when required but resist pulling on the cable or other conductor connected to the contact of the connector. Connectors of this type are known in which the connector includes a forwardly projecting resilient cantilever finger having a rear facing shoulder for latching engagement with an oppositely facing rigid shoulder on the terminal, the free end of the finger having an extension for engagement with a suitable tool for unlatching the connector for the terminal. This type of connector is described in UF. Patent Specification 1o8oL2o. An alternative form of knawn connector as described in UK Patent Specification No. 1463751 has a rearwardly projecting resilient cantilever finger. This connector latches to a terminal in a similar manner to the previous connector, but is released by depressing the free end of the finger, preferably by pulling the connector housing. Both these connectors have disadvantages, The first connector requires the use of a special tool to release the connector from a terminal. The second connector has the disadvantage that the extension of the finger needs to be a considerable distance from the rear facing shoulder on the finger, and hence the free end of the finger has to be depressed a considerable amount in order to release the latching engagement of the rear facing shoulder with the terminal. According to the invention an electrical connector comprises an electric contact engageable with a terminal by moving the connector in a forward direction into engagement with the terminal, a resilient cantilever finger having a rear facir shoulder for latching engagement with an oppositely facing rigid shoulder on the terminal, the free end of the finger having an extension for engagement for unlatching the connector from the terminal by flexing the finger to release the latching engagement, and a housing having a formation so shaped that when the housing moves in the rearward direction with respect to the contact the formation will engage the extension of the finger to release the latching engagement, allowIng the connector to be removed from the terminal characterised in that the finger projects forwardly0 Preferably the extension of the finger 2 our the engagIng formation on the housing has a flat surface oblIque to the mating axis for. engaging the other. The invention also includes a two part electrical coupling comprising the connector described and a terminal having a forwardly facing rigid shoulder for engagement with it in the manner described. Preferably the cantilever finger of the connector is so shaped that when the connector is engaged with the terminal, the terminal abuts 5 patt of the finder to inhibit further relative movement. This invention does not require the use of a special unlatching too, and the rear facing shoulder on the cantilever finger can be positioned agnacent the extension of the finger so that a small amount of movement of the free end of the finger will release the latching engagement of the rear facing shoulder with the terminal. Preferably the contact and the finger are stamped in e pIece from sheet metal. Under normal circumstances the housing will be e nra insulating material and In this case, one housing mar be common to several connectors. An embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a cross sectional view on the line I I in Figure 2 of a coupling in accordance with the InventIon and Figure 2 is a cross sectional view on the line II II in Figure 1, with the blade terminal omitted. The coupling 1 comprises a connector 2 having a sheet metal contact 3 whIch has a part 9 which is crimped to a conductor 4 and joined to a part having a channel cross sectton 5, the free ends of the arms 6 curved inwards, which engages a blade terminal 7. The contact 3 has a cantilever finger 8 pressed out from the base of the channel part , one end remaining attached to the contact 3 between the channel part 5 and the crimping part 9.The finger 8 is bent to form a first part 10 extending upwards, approximately normal to the mating axis, from this end, 2 seccnd part 11 extending forwards, approximately parallel to the mating axis, and an extension 12 at the free end at an oblique angle away from the mating axis. The upward part 10 of the finger 8 abuts the terminal 7, inhibiting further relative movement. A rear facing tab 13 is pressed down from the forward part 11 of the finger 8 near its free end, to form a shoulder 14 which latching engages the edge of a hole 15 in the blade terminal 7. The connector 2 also has an insulating housing 16 surrounding the contact 3.The housing has a rearwardly directed formation 17 with a surface 18 oblique to the mating axis in the same directicn as the oblique extension 12 of the finger 8 on the inside of the housing 16 at the blade terminal entry aperture 19. When the housing 16 Is moved b2clzards with respect to the contact 3 the surface 18 of the formation 17 engages under the oblique extension 12 of the finger 8, lIfting the tab 13 on the finger 8 out of the hole 15 in the blade terminal 7, allowing the connector 2 to slide freely from the terminal 7. The length of the sheet metal blank from which this contact is m e does not have to be increased to allow the addition of a cantilever finger. The upward part 10 of the finger 8 also prevenfis the conductor 4 from being inserted too far into the connector 2 before the conductor 4 is crimped to the connector 2 e
