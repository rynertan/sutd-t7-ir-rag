# Multi circuit fluid pressure braking system.

## Abstract
In a multi circuit fluid pressure braking system two reservoirs 4, 5 are chargeable via protection valves 9, 10 to provide fluid pressure supplies independently to two sepa rate braking circuits and a third circuit is supplied from the same two reservoirs via respective one way flow paths 14, 15 and a further protection valve 16 the opening pressure of which approximates to that of the first two protection valves but the reclosure setting of which is appreciably lower to permit operability of the third circuit down to a depleted valve of either of the reservoir pressures and the third protection valve having a way out which is sufficiently less than the way in to prevent spurious reclosure by transient pressure demands of the third circuit.

## Description
Multi circuit Fluid Pressure Braking Systems. This invention relates to multi circuit fluid pressure braking systems for vehicles. Multi circuit vehicle fluid pressure braking systems have been proposed wherein two reservoirs for respective independent primary service brake circuits are charged via respective first and second circuit protection valves, one or more further circuits being supplied from said reservoirs via check valves and a further protection valve the reclosure pressure of the third protection valve being appreciably lower than that of the first and second protection valves whereby with suitable reservoir capacity, a prescribed number of service brake operations may be achieved without recharge without depleting the reservoirs to a pressure level below which secondary operation would be prevented. One such system is described in U.K.Patent Specification No. 1,582,344. Furthermore, typical protection valves are described in technical pamphlet No. 9 011 published by Bendix Westinghouse Limited in April 1976. A further particular requirement which has also to be met when the multi circuit system is employed to control the braking circuits of a trailer coupled thereto concerns the magnitude of the available trailer brake control pressure after a predetermined number of brake applications. Typically, the control pressure for a ninth application after commencing with fully charged reservoir capacity must be at least 50 of1 the first application. A problem may be encountered with a system such as described in the above mentioned Patent Specification to the extent that if a high transient demand for pressure occurs in the further circuit which is supplied via the htird protection valve, the third protection valve may reclose prematurely and thereby inhibit the supply of pressure to the third circuit.One object of the invention is therefore to provide a system wherein this problem is removed or substantially reduced. The present invention provides a vehicle fluid pressure braking system including first and second reservoirs for supplying respective first and second fluid pressure operable brake circuits, means for charging said reservoirs via respective protection valves having a first opening pressure value and a second lower reclosing pressure value, unidirectional fluid flow paths from said reservoirs for supplying a third braking circuit via a third protection valve said third protection valve having a substantially equivalent opening pressure value but having a third reclosing pressure value which is appreciably lower than the second reclosing value for the first and second protection valves and a way out which is so appreciably less than the way in as to prevent transient air demands of the third circuit causing spurious reclosure of the third protection valve In order that the invention may be more clearly understood and more mreadily carried into effect, the same will be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Fig. 1 illustrates in schematic form a simplified multi circuit fluid pressure operable braking system for a tractor vehicle and, Fig. 2 illustrates schematically but more fully a design of third protection valve for use in the system of Fig.1. Referring to Fig. 1, the braking system is provided with air pressure operated front service brake actuators at 1 supplied by a first braking circuit and service actuators 2 supplied by a second braking circuit of the system. Additionally, spring brake actuators are provided at 3 which operate as secondary and or parking brakes for the vehicle associated with the rear axle only normally maintained in a fully pressurised state by a third braking circuit. Reservoirs for the first and second braking circuits are denoted by references 4 and 5 and these are charged from a compressor 6 via a wet tank 7 the pressure in which is sensed by a governor 8 for operating a compressor unloader. The output of the wet tank 7 is fed in parallel by respective single circuit protection valves 9 and 10 to reservoirs 4 and 5.The output of reservoir 4 feeds a first valve of a dual foot valve 11 and the output of reservoir 5 feeds the second valve of the dual foot valve 11. The separate circuits of the foot valve supply the front actuators 1 via quick release valve 12 and rear actuators 2 via quick release valve 13. Additionally, reservoirs 4 and 5 are connected via respective check valves 14 and 15 to a common way in to a third protection valve 16, the output of which is applied on the one hand via a check valve 17 as a supply input to a secondary brake hand valve 18 is an inverse output applied to spring brakes at 3 via a quick pressure release valve 29 and a further inverse output of 18 is applied to a so called plus plus minus multi relay valve 20 and provides the single inverse intput to this multi relay valve.Upright inputs to the multi relay valve are provided from the respective circuits of the dual foot valve 11 and the output which appears at line 21 of the multi circuit relay valve 20 constitutes the trailer service brake control pressure signal applied over a coupling when the trailer is connected. Referring briefly to Fig. 2, this shows again in the dotted outline 22 the check valves 14 and 15 of Fig. 1, together with further details of the third protection valve 16 the third protection valve consists of a housing 24 including, like other known protection valves, a diaphragm 25 which is spring lodeed by a spring 26 against a seat 27 the diaphragm thereby presenting an area Al to the incoming pressure and when the pressure at the output 27 attains a sufficiently high level, the diaphragm is deflected upwards to present the appreciably larger areaA2 to the reservoir pressure thereby holding the valve open,In the event of the pressure at 27 falling below a predetermined lower pressure which in the present instance is arranged by virtue of the relationship between the areas Al and A2, to be appreciably lower than the reclosure pressure for the protection valves 9 and 10, the diaphragm is deflected back onto the seat 27. In order to prevent such reclosure occurring in the event of short transient demands for air pressure in the line 27 by virtue for example of rapid operation of the secondary brake valve 18, the way out from the protection valve 16 is arranged at 28 to be so appreciably less than the way in whereby the pressure acting under the area A2 does not fall momentarily to the reclosure pressure despite such transient demands.Typically the way out may be up to 90 commat of the way in but is to be appropropriately selected according to the characteristics associated with valve 18. Referring now to the operation of the system of Fig. 1, the reservoirs 4 and 5 are charged from the compressor 6, wet ta k 7 and single circuit protection valves 9 and 10 in conventional manner to a pressure determined by the governor 8. Normal service operation of actuators 1 and 2 is provided in the normal case of intact first and second circuits by operation of the foot valve 11 by the vehicle driver. In the case of secondary operation being required, the driver operates the secondary brake valve 18 which is supplied in the present system via check valves 14 and or 15 via the third protection valve 16 and check valve 17 to normally apply a hold off pressure to the inverse input of the multi relay valve 20and to the spring brakes at 3. Such operation of valve 18 results in a reduction of the output pressures from the valve 18 thereby on the one hand producing an elevated pressure at the relay valve output 21 for operation of trailer brakes and on the other hand resulting in a reduction of hold off pressure to the spring brase 3 via quick release valve 29. Rapid operation of the secondary brake valve 18 could in certain circumstances cause an appreciable rapid demand on the non return valve 17 which would tend to cause the valve 16 to reclose prematurely and spuriously but becuase of the wide differential between the opening pressure of 16 which is substantially identical with that of 9 and 10 and the reclosing pressure of 16 which is appreciably less than 9 and 10 such premature reclosure is prevented. In a typical system, the primary protection valves 9 an 10 may be set to open at 6.5 bar and have pres bai responsive areas such that they then reclose at 5 bar whereas the secondary protection valve although set to open at 6.5 bar has a spring and pressure responsive areas which enable it to remain open down to a reclose pressure of 3.5 bar. All these pressures are lower than the cut in and cut out settings of governor 8 which may typically be 7 bar and 9.5 bar respectively. The purpose of the check valve 17 is to enable the spring brakes to remain in a fully released condition despite reduction of output pressure appearing at the way out of the protection valve 16 due to failure of supply line to trailer. Alhtough the fluid pressure braking system which has been described above is a system for use on a driven or tractor vehicle, the invention may be applied to circuits of a trailer vehicle.In such a trailer two reservoirs could again be provided, changeable from the towing tractor, the first two circuits specifically supplied by these reservoirs being circuits of a split service braking system and the third circuit being employed for controlling spring brakes primarily for parking purposes.
