# A detector circuit for current measurements.

## Abstract
For the measurement of large currents, d.c. as well as a.c., a so called zero flux current transformer may be used. It comprises two identically wound toroidal cores 11,12 , in which the magnetic flux induced by a main or primary current I₁ is neutralized by a counter flux induced by a compensation current I₂ , which by means of an amplifier circuit 40 is passed through a compensation winding 14 common for both cores 11,12 and having many turns. The compensation current I₂ is adjusted by means of the amplifier 40 to such a value, that the mean flux in the cores 11,12 is zero. The intensity of the compensation current I₂ is measured by the voltage drop across a measuring resistor 15 . Any unbalances between the primary and secondary ampere turns are sensed by a detecting circuit comprising a sensing winding 21,22 wound on each core 11,12 and divided into two subwindings which carries a magnetizing current I₃ from a current source 23 in such a way, that the odd harmonic components contained in the magnetizing current are outbalanced, whilst the even harmonic compo nents contained therein are added and conducted to a synchronous rectifier 32 to provide a control signal to the amplifier 40 for the adjusting of the compensation current I₂ . Hereby is obtained a largely improved signal to noise ratio for the signal applied to the synchronous rectifier 32 , and the need for a complex and expensive active 2nd harmonic filter is eliminated.
