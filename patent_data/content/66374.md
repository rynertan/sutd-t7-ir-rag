## Description
ENDOSCOPES This invention relates to endoscopes of the hard type containing an objective system, together with a relay lens system for transmitting an optical image of an object formed by the objective system. In a conventional endoscope that is to be inserted into a body cavity or the like for observation, diagnosis or treatment by using forceps, an image is formed by an objective system arranged at the tip of an inserted part, and this optical image is transmitted to an eyepiece system arranged in the rear operating part by a relay lens system so that this transmitted optical image of the object can be observed by an operator with the naked eye, recorded by a photographic camera or viewed via a television camera fitted to the rear part of the endoscope. Such endoscopes are often used in cases where an image of an affected part must be clear in detail, to permit magnified observation, particularly to assist diagnosis of the affected part. As a means of coping with such case, there is suggested in the Gazette of Japanese Utility Model Laid Open No. 87180 1977 the following formation wherein means are provided for a part of an objective system and relay lens system to be moved to vary the magnification of such object as an affected part or to adjust the focal length in the observation. In the formation, while the objective system is arranged movably in the axial direction inside the tip of an inserted part of the endoscope, a pulley is fitted near this lens system and a control wire extended out of the tip of the inserted part engages the above mentioned lens system through this pulley from an operating part so as to move the lens system forward rearward.However, in this conventional formation, as the lens system is moved in both forward and rearward directions with the drawing wire, there are problems that a pulley is required for the wire at the end of the inserted part, there is a lower limit for the diameter of the wire, a pipe is required to cover this drawing wire, and therefore the disadvantage arises that the outside diameter of the inserted part of the endoscope, which is naturally required to. be made as small as possible to reduce the pain of the patient and to improve the inserting operatability, becomes inevitably large and the structure complicated in this known formation.Further, in this prior art formation, if only one control wire is used, it is not possible to ensure that the lens system will be able to be stably moved and, even if a plurality of wires are used, the tensions acting on the respective wires will be difficult to maintain uniform and it may still be difficult to move the lens system in a stable manner. Further, as of a formation wherein a part of an objective system and relay lens system is moved to vary the magnification or adjust the focus, there is suggested an endoscope wherein, while an objective system is arranged movably in the axial direction inside the tip of an inserting part, a coil spring and electromagnet are incorporated for forward and rearward movement of this lens so that the lens may be moved forward and rearward by the repulsion and attraction of this electromagnet and the energising force of the coil spring.However, in such formation, it is difficult to properly adjust the repulsion and attraction of the electromagnet and the energising force of the coil spring to ensure positive stabilised movement of the lens. Further, as disclosed in United States Patent No.4149769 and West German Laid Open Patent Publication No.2640353, there is suggested an endoscope wherein a substantially tubular elongate jacket having one objective system arranged at the front end and one eyepiece system arranged at the rear end is so provided that an inserted part of an optical sighting tube can be inserted into this jacket tube. The above mentioned optical sighting tube is formed to be movable forward and rearward within the jacket tube along a longitudinal groove formed on the rear end side of the jacket so that, when the optical sighting tube is moved forward and rearward, an image of an object will be formed and varied in magnification by one objective system at the front end of the above mentioned jacket and the other objective system on the optical sighting tube side in the rear of the above mentioned objective system and will be further transmitted through relay lens systems arranged within the optical sighting tube and an optical image varied in magnification will be able to be observed in the eyepiece system at the rear end of the jacket tube and on the rear end side of the optical sighting tube. In this prior art, there are problems that, when the optical sighting tube is moved forward and rearward, an image will be able to be formed and varied in magnification by the objective systems at the front end of the jacket tube and at the tip of the optical sighting tube but, in this case, the eyepiece systems will also move together and therefore, though a small variation of the magnification may be possible, such a comparatively large variation of magnification particularly the enlargement as may be achieved in a zooming optical system will not be possible in the observation. Further, most of the intermediate lens arrangements are not changed at all, but only relative movement of the front and rear lenses to obtain a desired performance and the design of the lenses is more restricted than in the present invention, wherein any of the intermediate lens systems may be moved.The means of moving the optical sighting tube forward and rearward with respect to the jacket for the observation as varied in the magnification in the above is not provided with a fine movement adjusting means and, in the case of a clear observation in detail, the movable operation directly moving the optical sighting tube forward and rearward with respect to the jacket will be difficult and inconvenient. One object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope wherein the magnification may be varied substantially without enlarging the diameter of an inserted part, whilst enabling details to be clearly observed, and permitting fine adjustment to be easily made, both of magnification and of focus. Another object of the present invention is to realise the above mentioned precision and flexibility with a relatively simple structure of low cost. According to the present invention there is provided anendoscope having an observing optical system wherein an image of an object in front of an inserted part is formed by an objective system arranged within a lens tube inserted through an inner tube within the inserted part and the formed optical image is transmitted rearward by relay lens systems arranged within a lens tube in the rear of said objective system so as to be observed from the rear of an operating part, and means being provided to move said objective system, said relay lens systems, or part of one or both of them being moved so as to make magnification variation or focus adjustment possible, characterised in that the lens system made movable is connected to the tip of a sliding pipe arranged between the lens tube and inner tube and the sliding pipe is coupled at the rear to a driving mechanism provided in the operating part and having a fine movement adjusting function. The invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a vertical section showing details of one exemplary embodiment of an endoscope constructed in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a section on line A A in Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a section on line B B in Figure 1. In the endoscope embodiment illustrated an endoscope 1 comprises an operating part 2 and insertion part 3. The operating part 2 is formed by a holding frame 6 having a connector 4 on the outer periphery, a flange 5 projecting inwardly from the internal wall, and an eyepiece frame 7, joined together by screwing, bonding or fusing.On the other hand, the inserted part 3 is formed of an outer tube 8 fitted and fused into the front of the operating part 2 and projecting therefrom, an inner tube 9 inserted into the operating part 2 from the tip of the outer tube 8 and fitted and fused or bonded in the rear part to the flange 5 of the holding frame 6 and light guide fibres 10 arranged in the annular space between the outer tube 8 and inner tube 9 and extended out in the rear part to the end surface of the connector 4 of the holding frame 6 and to the end surface of the outer tube 8 at the front. A cover glass 12 is fitted and bonded through a frame 11 to the tip of the inner tube 9, a lens tube 13 is inserted and arranged in the operating part 2 from the rear of the cover glass 12 with a gap G left within the inner tube 9. This lens tube 13 is fused on the front outer periphery to the inner tube 9, is projected in the rear part into the operating part 2 from the rear end of the inner tube 9 and has a supporting tube 14 secured to this projected part. This supporting tube 14 is held by screws 15 screwed in from the outer periphery of the holding frame 6 to support the lens tube 13 in the rear part. Within the lens tube 13, an objective system 17 is arranged and fixed through a frame 16, and relay lens systems 18 are arranged and fixed in the rear of it.Also, an eyepiece system 19 is fitted and bonded in the supporting tube 14 in the rear of the lens tube 13, and a cover glass 20 is fitted and bonded in a rear opening of the eyepiece frame 7. A hollow cavity 21 is formed within the lens tube 13 between the relay lens system 18 adjacent to the objective system 17 and the relay lens system 18 and a sliding lens frame 23 fitted with a magnification varying lens 22 is arranged slidably in the axial direction within this hollow cavity 21, Further, a sliding pipe 24 is inserted and arranged in the gap G between the above mentioned inner tube 9 and lens tube 13 and has pins 25 projecting on the inner periphery at the front end. These pins 25 are locked and fixed in the sliding lens frame 23, through axial slits 26 formed in the lens tube 13, to connect the sliding pipe 24 and sliding lens frame 23 with each other. The sliding lens frame 23 is thus slidable forward and rearward by the length of the slit 26 of the lens tube 13 within the hollow cavity 21.The above mentioned sliding pipe 24 projects at the rear into the operating part 2, and a rack fitting member 28 having a rack 27 is secured to this projecting part.The holding frame 6 has a through bore 29, through which a shaft 30 is inserted and supported within the operating part 2. This shaft 30 has an operating knob 31 secured to the outer end and a pinion 32 secured to the inner end, and this pinion 32 is meshed with the rack 27. The throughbore 29 has a packing seal 33 arranged in it, to make the casing watertight. It is one of the features that the pinion 32 is so formed that, when the inclination of the teeth meshing with the rack 27 is large, that is, the forward or rearward movement of the rack 27 when the shaft 30 of the pinion 32 makes one rotation is small, so that the finely adjusting function in the case of the forward and rearward movement of the magnification varying lens 22 will be retained. Further it is another feature of this embodiment that, as only a part of the optical system to the objective system 17 and relay lens systems 18 is movable, the load on the movable part can be made small, the sliding pipe 24 can be made light and thin, and it is not necessary to substantially enlarge the diameter of the inserted part 3. In the above mentioned case, if the magnification varying lens 22 is provided on the relay lens system 18 side, the sliding pipe 24 will be able to be made short and the advantage in the weight reduction and manufacture will be high. In observation, varied magnification is obtained when the operating knob 31 is rotated and operated, the pinion 32 will be rotated, the rack 27 meshing with this pinion 32 will be moved forward or rearward, and this movement will be transmitted to the sliding lens frame 23 through the sliding pipe 24, so that the magnification varying lens 22 will be moved forward or rearward and thereby the magnification will be able to be varied from a small value to a large value. The magnification varying lens 22 in this case uses a zoom optical system. In case a lens system which is not a zoom optical system is used, the magnification varying lens 22 can be used to adjust the sight or focus in the observation from the rear of a magnification varying lens or eyepiece system 19, within the allowable range of the sight adjustment of the observer. In the above described embodiment of the present invention, the formation example wherein the lens 22 in a part of the relay lens system 18 is moved has been shown.However, it may be so formed that the magnification can be varied or the focus can be adjusted by moving the objective system itself. Further, the driving mechanism for sliding the sliding pipe 24 need not be formed by a rack and pinion, but also other known mechanisms, for example, a cam means wherein a longitudinal groove is formed in the outer tube in the operating part or an extension of the outer tube to the operating part or a substantial equivalent or, in some case, the lens tube , a pin provided to project on the outside from the inside sliding pipe 24 is passed through the longitudinal groove and further a ring having a cam groove formed to contain this pin is externally fitted to the above mentioned outer tube so as to be rotatable in the peripheral direction. In such case, the ring is secured so as not to move in the longitudinal direction. According to the above mentioned formation, when the ring is rotated, the pin guided and regulated by the cam groove w ll move the sliding pipe 24 forward and rearward. In such case, if the cam groove is made close to a lateral groove, that is to say, is made small in the distance for which the pin moves in the axial direction longitudinal direction for the rotating distance of the outer periphery of the ring, the fine movement adjusting function will be retained and the magnification variation or focus adjustment will be able to be easily made. If a sliding pipe provided on the side surface with a groove, hole or opening of any other shape is used, the overall weight may be reduced.
