# Process for purification of acrylic acid by fractional crystallization.

## Abstract
A method of separating acrylic acid from an aqueous solution containing acrylic acid, comprising adding a salt that eliminates the eutectic point between acrylic acid and water, for example an alkali metal salt, in particular sodium chloride, to the aqueous solution in an amount sufficient to saturate the aqueous solution, and fractionally crystallising the aqueous solution to obtain acrylic acid. The fractional crystallisation is preferably carried out in from three to six stages, and leads to a product which contains more than 99 of acrylic acid and less than 0.02 by weight of added salt, for example sodium chloride.
