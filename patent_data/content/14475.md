Preparation of 6R,7S 7 R phenylglycinamido3 chloro l azabicyclo 4,2,0 oct 2 en 8 on 2 carboxylic acid alternative method EMI39.1 1 1 Preparation of cell suspension a Cultivation of a microorganism having an ability of ptically selective acylation. A3 a seed strain, Pseudomonas melanogenum ATCC 17308 Biological properties are described in Journai of the Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan 37, 71 1963 is used. s s the seed medium, an aqueous solution containing 1 polypeptone, 1 yeast extract, 0.5 meat extract, 0.5 sodium glutamate and 0.25 sodium chloride and adjusted at a pH of 7.0 with 5N NaOH is used. One loopful seed strain is.inoculated into 10 mQ the seed medium in 50 mt of a large test tube and culturing is carried out at a temperature of 300C for 24 hours. The whole amount of the seed medium is put into 300 mQ of the culture medium in 2 l of Erlenmeyer flask and culturing is carried out at a temperature of 300C.The composition of the culture medium is the same as that of the seed medium. b Preparation of cell suspension After culturing for 24 hours, cell bodies are recovered from the culture broth by centrifugation and washed 2 times with 50 ml of 0.9 saline solution. The cells are suspended in a concentration of 20 mg mQ by dry weight in1 30M phosphate buffer pH 6.5 . 10 2 Preparation of a substrate solution 200mg of the trifluoroacetate of cis 7 amino 3 chloro l azabicyclo 4,2,0 oct 2 en 8 on 2 carboxylic acid starting compound a obtained as in reference example 6 and 800 mg of the hydrochloride ofD phenylglycinemethylester starting compoud b are added in 9 mQ of 1 30N1 potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 . SN KOH is added in a small portion and the mixture is again adjusted to a pF of 6.5 to dissolve two starting compounds.Finally, deionized water is added to make 10 mQ of a solution. 10 3 Enzyme reaction In this step, 10 ml of the cell suspension is added to 10 m of the substrate solution and enzyme reaction is carried out at a temperature of 300C for 1.5 hours.The reaction is monitored by high speed liquid chromatography using TRI ROTA product of Nippon Bunko Co. Ltd. andPrepack column Nucleosil 10C18 product of Gaschro Xogyo Co., Ltd. . Elution is carried out with 7 methanol 0.2M KH2PO solution. Reaction reaches maximum in a yield of 90 to the starting compound a in 1.5 hours. 10 4 isolation and Purification of the desired compound After the completion of reaction, cell bodies axe removed from the reaction solution by centrifugation. The supernatant is concentrated under reduced pressure and charged on a column 1.6 cm width, 50 cm height packed with Diaion HP 10. After adding 200 mQ of deionized water, elution is carried out with 25 aqueous methanol solution. Then, the fractions containing the desired compound are concentrated under reduced pressure to make a 5 mQ of concentrate. The concentrate is charged on a column 1.6 cm width,. 64.5 cm height packed with 130 mQ of Sephadex LH2O and elution is carried out with a solvent of water and methanol 50 50 . The desired compound is eluted in 55 mL to 75 mQ of fractions.. The fractions are concentrated under reduced pressure and lyophilized to obtain 78 mg of a white powder. Properties of the product coincide with the less polar isomer A in Reference Example 9.
