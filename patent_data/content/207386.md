# Supporting spool for electrical windings.

## Abstract
The spool 1 comprises essentially two juxtaposed half spools 3,4 formed simultaneously in the spool manufactur ing process. The half spools 3,4 are associated with each other through a rupturable connection element 22 and a hinge element 21 for the purpose of aligning the half spools 3,4 , thereby enabling fast and easy winding of en electric conductor 23 around them. This step is facilitated by the provision of temporary hooking and gripping elements 19,20 on the half spools 3,4 , each of them being also pro vided, at the non hinged end thereof, with suitable seats 15 17 for electric connectors 23 .

## Description
ZS PPORTING SPOOL POR ELECTRICAL WINDINGS This invention relates to a supporting spool for electrical windings. In induction motors, there is generally provided a magnetic core with which an electrical winding is associated which is passed through by a current at a given value. With small size motors, where U shaped magnetic cores are used, separate spools are located at each of their wings, such spools carrying a previously wound electric conductor. Such spools, being initially separate, are later electrically interconnected. A drawback to be encountered with such known spool types is the complexity of their manufacture and assembly, they being manufactured and assembled separately, and each having one element for mutual electric connection. It is an aim of this invention to eliminate the foregoing drawbacks by providing a spool which allows the achievement of great simplicity of construction and assembly. Within the above general aim, it is an obJect of the invention to provide a spool which requires no means of electric connection to other spools defining the winding. It is another obJect of the invention to provide a spool which is of low cost, and obtainable by utilizing ordinary equipment. According to one aspect of the invention, this aim and these and other objects which will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a supporting spool for electrical windings, characterized in that it comprises two half spools associated together through a temporary connection element and a hinge element, said halfspools having temporary hooking and gripping elements, respectively, and suitable seats for electric oonne t ors and for the end of a wire lead. Further features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description of a preferred embodiment illustrated by way of example in the accompanying drawing sheets, where Figure 1 is a fragmentary perspective view of two half spools according to the invention during the step of winding an electric conductor therearound Figure 2 is a schematic top plan view of the two half spools associated with each other Figure 3 is a partially sectional end view of the head of a spool according to the invention, taken in the section plane Ill Ill of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a sectional side view of a spool taken in the section plane IV IV of Figure 3 Figures 5 and 6 are partially sectional detail views of the temporary connection element and respectively, the hinge element of the spool according to the invention Figure 7 is a fragmentary detail top plan view of a head of a spool showing a seat for acoommodating one end of an electric conductor Figure 8 is a detail sectional end view taken in the section plane VIIIIVIII of Figure 3 and Pigure 9 is a top plan view illustrating the coupling of two half spools to a magnetic core. With reference to the foregoing figures, the spool 1 for supporting electric winding 2 comprises essentially two half spools 3 and 4. Each of those half spools is in turn composed of two substantially alike heads, indicated respectively by the numerals 5, 6 and 7, 8. Those heads are laid in confronting pairs and have an essentially parallelepipedal shape, being moreover united in pairs along a perpendicular axis by core elements or Joining elements, indicated respectively by the numerals 9 and 10. The elements 9 and 10 have in turn a parallelepipedal shape, are hollow inside, and have a longitudinal mid axis extending stibstantially through the centre point of each heads united therewith. At each of the heads, there is formed to coincide with the peripheral edge 11 of the elements 9 and 10 an opening 12, adapted to allow the insertion of the wings 13 of a magnetic core 14 of U like shape therein. At the heads 5 and 7 there are present respectively seats 15 and 16 shaped to match the ends of electric connectors insertable therein. In the proximity of the seats 15, the head 5 has a further seat 17 having an essentially trapezoidal cross section and having an opening 18 formed close to the peripheral edge 11 of the element 9. Projecting from the head 6, at the side thereof opposed to the core element 10, is a hooking element 19 composed of a tooth formed from the same material of the spool 1, said tooth being adapted for temporary engagement in cooperation with a gripping element 20 of matching shape in the form of a seat formed at the head 8 of the half spool 4. Both the hooking element 19 and gripping element 20 extend at the transverse mid plane of the respective heads 6, 8 of the half spools 3,4 and are equidistant from the longitudinal mid axis of the same. I aring the manufacturing stage, the two halfspools are obtained as shown in Figure 2, that is the one beside the other, the same being associated together through a hinge element 21 and a temporary connection element 22. The hinge element 21 is composed of an elastically deformable strap Joining one of the longitudinal peripheral edges of the mutually associated heads 6 and 8, the connection element 22 being composed of a thin, rupturable break off connection placed between the confronting longitudinal peripheral edges of the heads 5 and 7. Once the half spools are obtained the rupturable connection forming the element 22 may be broken, and subsequently, the heads 6,8 of the half spools 3,4 can be mutually rotated about the hinge element 21 as indicated by the arrow A in Figure 2, until the tooth 19 engages in the gripping element or seat 20, thus mutually aligning the longitudinal axes of the two halfspools 3,4, and imparting to the spool 1 the configura tion as shown in Figure 1. The mutual 180 degree rotation of the two half spools is allowed by the provision of the flexible hinge element 22, the configuration of the two halfspools 3,4 shown in Figure 1 being maintainable by virtue of the presence of the mutually engageable hooking element 19 and gripping element 20, present on the heads 6 and 8 respectively. The next stage consists of temporarily placing and engaging the end of an electric conductor 23 in the seat 17 in a wedge like manner, which is effective to prevent the wire from unwinding during the following stage of winding the same around the element 9, by passing the conductor 23 around the hinge element 21 Figures 1,9 . Once the desired number of turns is obtained, winding can continue on the adjoining element 10. On completion of that operation, the ends of the conductor 23 will be placed at the seats 15 and 16 wherein the ends of a preset electric connector will be placed. It will then be sufficient to uncouple the element 19 from the seat 20 for re positioning the half spools 3 and 4 side by side so as to allow insertion of the wings 13 of a magnetic core 14 into the core elements 9 and 10, to obtain the configuration shown in Figure 9. It has thus been shown how the invention achieves its objects, it having achieved considerable simplicity of construction and assembly. The two half spools are in fact obtained in a single stage of making, the presence of the hinge element allowing for a subsequent fast and easy winding of the electric conductor, that stage being facilitated by the presence of the elements 19 and 20. The hinge element 21 further affords electric continuity between the two windings of the two halfspools, avoiding the making of particular devices for electric connection therebetween. Of course, the materials used and the dimensions may be any ones, depending on requirements.
