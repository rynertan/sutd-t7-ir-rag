# Signal generating arrangements.

## Abstract
A digitally controlled, presettable, ramp signal generat ing arrangement comprising digital to analogue converter means DA and integrator means A1, A2 having a first mode in which its output O assumes a value representative of the output of the converter means, and a second mode in which its output changes at a rate dependent on the output of the converter means. The arrangement finds especial application in symbol display arrangements.
