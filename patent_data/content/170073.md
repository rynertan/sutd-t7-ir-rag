Representative pathogens which are sensitive to antibiotics I include Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella Pneumoniae,Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhosa. Pseudomonas and Bacterium proteus. The antibacterials of the invention are not limited to utility as medicaments they may be used in all manner of industry. for example additives to animal feed, preservation of food, disinfectants, and in other industrial systems where control of bacterial grovth is desired.For example, they may be employed in aqueous compositions in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 parts of antibiotic per million parts of solution in order to destroy or inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria on medical and dental equipment and as bactericides in industrial applications, for example in uaterbased paints and in the white water of paper ills to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. The compounds of this invention may be used in any of a variety of pharmaceutical preparations.They may be employed in capsule, powder form. in liquid solution, or in suspension. They may be administered by a variety of means those of principal interest include topically or parenterally by injection intravenously or intramuscularly . Compositions for injection, a preferred route of delivery, Day be prepared in unit dosage form in ampules. or in multidose containers. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions. or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution, at the time of delivery, with a suitable vehicle. such as sterile water. Topical applications may be formulated in hydrophobic or hydrophilic bases as ointments, creams, lotions, paints, or powders. The dosage to be administered depends to a large extent upon the condition and size of the subject being treated as well as the route and frequency of administration the parenteral route by injection being preferred for generalized infections. Such matters, however, are left to the routine discretion of the therapist according to principles of treatment well known in the antibiotic art. In general. a daily dosage consists of from about 5 to about 600 mg of active ingredient per kg of body weight of the subject in one or more treatments per day. A preferred daily dosage for adult humans lies in the range of from about 10 to 240 mg of active ingredient per kg of body weight.Another factor influencing the precise dosage regimen, apart from the nature of the infection and peculiar identity of the individual being treated. is the molecular weight of the chosen species of this invention I . The compositions for human delivery per unit dosage, whether liquid or solid, may contain from 0.1 to 99t of active material. the preferred range being from about 10 60S. The composition will generally contain from about 15 mg to about 1500 mg of the active ingredient however, in general, it is preferable to employ a dosage amount in the range of from about 250 mg to 1000 mg. In parenteral administration, the unit dosage is usually the pure compound I in sterile water solution or in the form of a soluble powder intended for solution. The preferred method of administration of the formula I antibiotic is parenteral by i.v. infusion, i.v. bolus, or i.m. injection. For adults, 5 50 Dg of Formula I antibiotic per kg of body weight given 2, 3, or 4 times per day is preferred. Preferred dosage is 250 mg to 1000 mg of the Formula I antibiotic given two b.i.d. three t.i.d. or four q.i.d. times per day. More specifically, for rild infections, and particularly urinary tract infections. a dose of 250 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is recommended. For moderate infections against highly susceptible gram positive and gram negative organisms, a dose of 500 ing t.i.d. or q.i.d.is recommended. For severe. life threatening infections against organisms at the upper limits of sensitivity to the antibiotic, a dose of 1000 t.i.d.or q.i.d. is recommended. For children. a dose of 5 25 mg kg of body weight given 2, 3. or 4 times per day is preferred a dose of 10 mg kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is usually recommended. Antibiotic compounds of Formula I are of the broad class known as carbapenems or l carbadethiapenems. Certain of these carbapenems are susceptible to attack by a renal enzyme known as dehydropeptidase DHP . This attack or degradation may reduce the efficacy of the carbapenem antibiotic. Tnhibitors of DHP and their use with carbapenem antibiotics are disclosed in the prior art tsee published European Patent Applications No. 79102616.4 filed July 24. 1979 Patent Number 10573 79102615.6, filed July 24, 1979 application no.15573 and No. 82107174.3, filed August 9, 1980 application no. 72014 . The present I compounds may. where DHP inhibition is desired or necessary, be combined or used vith the appropriate DHP inhibitor as described in the aforesaid published applications. Thus, to the extent that the cited European patent applications 1. define the procedure for determining DHP susceptibility of the present carbapenems and 2. disclose suitable inhibitors. combination compositions and methods of treatment. they are incorporated herein by reference. A preferred weight ratio of I compound DHP inhibitor in the combination compositions is about 1 1. A preferred DHP inhibitor is 7 L 2 amino 2 carboxyethylthio 2 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamide 2 heptenoic acid or a useful salt thereof. These combination compositions and their use is another embodiment of the present invention. The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by any convenient process.A.

After cooling, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum to give a clear liquid that partially solidified on standing. This material was distilled to give a white, crystalline solid 4.65 g bp. ca. 1100C 0.25 mm. The solid product was recrystallized from ethyl acetate hexane to afford the title compound 3.78 g, 67 as white crystals.

The mixture was filtered and the solids washed with acetonitrile. The filtrate and washings were evaporated under vacuum to a residue which was triturated with three portions of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extracts were filtered, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated under vacuum to afford the title compound 526 mg, 85 as an orange liquid.NMR CDC13 2.40 s, CH3CO , 3.91 s, CH3 , 4.26 s, CH2 , 7.80 s, H5 .Step D. 5 Acetylthiomethyl 1,4 dimethyl 1,2,4 tri azolium trifluoromethanesulfonate A solution of 3 acetylthiomethyl 2 methyl1,2,4 triazole 244 mg, 1.43 mmol in anhydrous methylene chloride 1.4 ml was cooled in an ice bath under a nitrogen atmosphere and treated with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 194 l, 1.71 mmol . The resulting mixture was stirred in the cold for 30 minutes, then evaporated under vacuum.
