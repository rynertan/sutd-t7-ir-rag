In the past, the vast majority of agricultural chemical research work was directed towards the development of chemical fertilizers and the development of chemicals to combat pests, diseases and weeds which reduce the yield of crops. The belief was that by adequately feeding the plant and by optimizing its environment, the yields of the crop could be maximized. In recent years it has become clear that it is possible to affect the growth of plants in a much more fundamental way, that is by the application of chemicals which affect the biochemical processes occuring in the plant. Much research is now being directed towards the development of chemical plant growth regulants which are capable of altering the biochemistry of plants in such a way that useful effects are achieved. One important field of research is into the stimulation of crops to produce higher yields. It would for example be most useful to be able to increase the yield of soyabeans, a valuable source of protein, by means of a chemical treatment. The invention provides a compound of the general formula EMI2.1 in which X represents an oxygen or sulphur atom Y represents an hydrogen or halogen atom or an alkyl group Z represents an alkyl group Ar represents an optionally substituted phenyl group and R represents a group i NR1R2 or ONR R , in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or cycloalkyl group and R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy or hydroxy group, or an acyl group derived from a carboxylic or carbamic acid, or an alkyl group substituted with a carboxylic acid or ester group, or R1 and R2 together with the interjacent nitrogen atom repre sent an optionally substituted heterocyclic ring or ii oR3 in which R3 represents an alkenyl, alkynyl, cyclo alkyl or aryl group or an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cyclo alkyl or aryl group substituted by one or more of the same or different substituents selected from halogen atoms, alkoxy, alkylthio, cyano and aryl groups, acyl groups derived from carboxylic or carbamic acids, groups of formula NR1R2 where R1 and R have the meaning given above, and carboxy groups and salts and esters thereof or iii SR in which R has one of the meanings given above for R3 or represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group or iv ON CIt4It5 in which R has the meaning given above and R5 3 has one of the meanings given above for R3 or represents an 4 alkyl group, or R4 end R5 together with the interJacent carbon atom represent an optionally substituted carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring or v NR6NR7R8 in in which each of R and R7 independently has one of the meanings given above for R1 and R8 has one of the meanings given above for It or represents an acyl group derived from a carboxylic acid, or R7 and It together with the interjacent nitrogen atom represent an optionally subst ituted heterocyclic ring.

More preferably, Ar represents a phenyl group which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more halogen atoms and or methyl groups. An especially prefered group Ar is a monohalophenyl group, especially a 4 chlorophenyl group. 12 In a group of formula NRlR2 or ONR1R2, Rl preferably repre sents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl, especially methyl, group, or a cycloalkyl, especially cyclohexyl, group and It represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl, especially methyl, group, an alkoxy, especially methoxy, group, a hydroxy group, or a group of formulaCOR9 or CO.NHR9 where R9 is an alkyl, especially methyl, or cycloalkyl, especially cyclohexyl, group or CgÏCOOR11 where R10 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, especially methyl, and R is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of up to 3 carbon atoms, 1 ethyl or R1 and 2 especially ethyl or It and It together with the interjacent nitrogen atom represent a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring having 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms, for example an imidazole or triazole ring.

Preferred salts are alkali metal salts or optionally alkyl substituted ammonium salts, and prefered esters are alkyl esters. More preferably R3 represents an alkenyl group, for example an allyl group, an cycloalkyl group, for example a cyclohexyl group, a monohaloalkyl group, a benzyl group, or a group CH CH 3 or CH2 n where n is 1 to 4, bearing an alkylcarbonyl group, an alkoxy group, an NR R group or a carboxy group or a salt or ester thereof. In a group of formula SR4, R4 suitably has one of the preferred meanings given above for R3, or represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group preferably having up to 4 carbon atoms, for example a methyl, ethyl or isopropyl group. 45 4 In a group of formula ON CR4R5, R4 suitably has one of the preferred meanings given above, and R5 suitably has one of the preferred meanings given above for R3 or represents an alkyl, especially methyl, group. In a group of formula NR6NR7R8, each of It , R7 and It preferably independently has one of the preferred meanings given for Rl above or R7 and R together with the interjacent nitrogen atom represent a heterocyclic ring having 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms, for example an imidazole or triazole ring. Especially preferred compounds of the general formula I are those in which R represents a group of general formula i NR R in which R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl or cyclohexyl group, and R2 represents a methoxy group or a CO.NH cyclohexyl group or R and R together with the interjacent nitrogen atom represent an imidazole ring or ii OR3 in which R3 represents an allyl, 2 chloroethyl, 2 bromoethyl or methylcarbonylmethyl group or iii SIt in which R represents an isopropyl or cyclohexyl group or iv ON CIt It in which each of R and R5 represents a methyl group or v NR6NR7R8 in which R6 represents a hydrogen atom and each of R7 and R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the general formula I, in one or more steps, which involves converting a compound of the general formulaEMI5.1 in which Ar, X, Y and Z have the meanings given for the general formula I and Q represents a hydrogen atom, a cation or an alkyl group, into a compound of the general formula I by reaction with a compound capable of replacing the group OQ with a group R whereR has the meaning given for the general formula I. It may in some cases be desirable to prepare one compound of the general formula I and then convert said compound into another compound of formula I. The process according to the invention is, in general terms, an esterification, transesterification or amidation reaction, and may be carried out under the conditions usual for such reactions.It is often useful to start from the free acid of formula II and to convert it into a reactive functional derivative thereof. An acid halide, especially the acid chloride, is often a useful reactive derivative. A mixed anhydride may also be very useful.Generally, mixed anhydrides may be prepared by reacting the free acid or, preferably, an amine salt, for example the triethylamine salt thereof, with an ester of chloroformic acid, to give a mixed anhydride containing the groupingEMI6.1 Common chloroformate esters are the benzyl ester and alkyl esters, for example the ethyl ester or isobutyl ester. In some cases, a reactive functional derivative which is itself compound of the general formula I according to the invention may be prepared and subsequently converted into another compound of the general formula I. Compounds of the general formula I in which R represents an imidazole ring bonded through a nitrogen atom, are especially useful in this respect. The process of the invention is suitably carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent, for example a hydrocarbon or a halogented hydrocarbon. Water may be suitable in some cases. The reaction temperature may vary widely depending on the reactants used, but it is suitably in the range from 0 to l5O0C. It may in some cases be most convenient to conduct the reaction at room temperature or at the reflux temperature of the solvent used. Suitable compounds capable of replacing the OQ group by a group R in the process according to the invention, include i compounds of formula NHR R2 or HONOR ii compounds of formula R30H or R3Hal where Hal is a halogen atom iii compounds of formula R4SH iv compounds of formula HON CIt It or alkali metal salts thereof and V compounds of formula NHIt7NR8It9. Thus compounds of general formula I in which R is an NRlIt2 or ONR R group, may be prepared by reacting an acid of formula II or a functional derivative thereof with an amine or hydroxylamine of formula NHR R or HO.NRR2. The acid chloride is a useful functional derivative. Alternatively, the acid may be reacted directly with carbonyl diimidazole to produce the compound of general formula I in which R represents an N bonded imidazole group, and if desired, said compound may be further reacted with an appropriate amine or hydroxylamine to produce a second compound of general formula I.An especially preferred method of preparing compounds in which R represents ONR1R2 is by the mixed anhydride technique described above, followed by reaction with the appropriate hydroxylamine. Compounds of general formula I in which R is an OR3 group may be prepared by any suitable esterification or transesterification process. For example, an alcohol of formula R30H may be reacted directly with a free acid of formula II or with a reactive derivative thereof, such as the acid chloride or the imidazole derivative described above. Especially for substituted alkyl esters, it is preferred to react a compound of formula II in which Q is a cation, especially an alkali metal ion, with a compound of formula R3Hal where Hal is a halogen, especially chlorine, atom. Compounds in which R represents SR4 may be prepared by the same general methods as described above using a thiol It SH instead of an alcohol R30H, or, alternatively, by transesterification.Thus an alkyl ester of formula II may be reacted with a compound of formula R4SH to produce the desired compound. Compounds in which It represents ON CF.5R6 may be prepared by reacting a functional derivative of the acid of formula II, suitably the acid halide or an imidazole derivative, with an oxime of formula HON CR5,6 or, preferably, an alkali metal salt thereof. Alternatively, the mixed anhydride technique described above may be used. Compounds in which R represents NR7NR8R9 are most suitably prepared by reacting an alkyl ester of formula II or functional derivative of an acid of formual II, with a hydrazide of general formula RNR7NR8It9. The compounds according to the invention exhibit useful plant growth regulating effects, and the invention therefore provides a plant growth regulating composition which comprises a compound of the general formula I together with a suitable carrier. The invention also provides a method of regulating the growth of a plant, which comprises treating the plant, the seed from which it is to be grown, or the medium in which it is growing or to be grown, with a compound or a composition according to the invention. Different plant growth regulating effects will be obtained depending on the growth stage of the plant when treated. One preferred embodiment of the invention is a method of increasing the yield of soyabeans, which comprises treating a soyabean plant or the soil in which it is growing with a compound or a composition according to the invention, the treatment being carried out at a growth stage after the flowers of the plant have differentiated. Generally the treatment may be carried out from the time at which the flowers of the plant have differentiated, and through out the time when the flowers are open. A second preferred embodiment of the invention is a method of sterilizing the male anthers of a plant, which comprises treating the plant or the soil in which it is growing with a compound or a composition according to the invention, the treatment being carried out at a growth stage such that sterilization occurs. This second embodieht of the invention makes it possible to sterilize the male anthers of plants, especially small grain cereal plants, without substantially affecting female fertility. The resulting male sterile plant may then be cross pollinated by pollen from a plant of a different strain, producing F1 hybrid seed. This process is especially useful for self pollinating plants. Thus the invention also provides a method of producingF1 hybrid seed which comprises cross pollinating a plant which has been treated by the sterilizing process of the present invention with a second plant of a different strain. The appropriate growth stage for carrying out the sterilizing process will vary from species to species, but generally it is appropriate to treat the plant at a growth stage before or during the earlier stages of flower differentation. For small grain cereal plants, such as wheat or barley, the treatment is most suitably carried out when the plant is at a stage of growth between late tillering and emergence of the ear. Preferably the growth of plants is regulated by the application of the active compound at a dosage in the range of from 0.05 to 2 kg ha, preferably 0.25 to 1 kg ha. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating herbicidal compositions may be used. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatomaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes, for example beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones,for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Agricultural compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic.Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example p octylphenol or E octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The compositions of the invention may for example be formul ated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols.Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 and 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain, in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 010 w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar compositions to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 2 10 w of active ingredient. Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques.Generally, granules will contain 2 25 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, slow release modifiers and binding agents. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors.Suspension concentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 1075 w active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agents, 0.1 10 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10 w of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as anti freeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention. The said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The compositions of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example, other compounds possessing plant growth regulating, insecticidal or fungicidal properties.The following Examples illustrate the invention.Example 1 Preparation of the 2 propanone oxime ester of 1 4 chlorohenyI 3 carboxy 6 methylpyridazin 4 one 1 4 chlorophenyl 3 carboxy 6 methylpyridazin 4 one 2.6 g was dissolved in methylene chloride 125 ml and carbonyldiimidazole 2 g was added.

Liquid formulations of the compounds were applied to plants at an early stage of flower development. The formulations used consisted of 60 water, 40 acetone which contained 0.4 TRITONX155 Trade Mark , and amounts of the test compound to give a spray application eqivalent to 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 Kg ha. In order to induce nodulation, the soyabean seeds were inoculated with a commercial strain of Rhizobium Nitrogerm , Root Nodule Pty., Ltd., Australia prior to sowing in a loam grit 5 1 mixture in 5 diameter pots. Plants were maintained at 21 250C under 14 hr. day length and watered by sub irrigation.Treatments were as foliar applications to three plants for each dose of the test material, applied in a volume equivalent to 632 litres per hectare. After treatment the plants were set out in a randomised block design. After four weeks the total pod number per plant was recorded. Results were derandomised and mean values calculated and expressed as a percentage of the untreated controls. The pod numbers thus obtained are given in Table I. Table ICompound of Example No. Number of Pods on soyabeans of control 0.5 Kg ha 1 kg ha 2 kg ha 2 154 100 115 4 169 276 292 5 100 93 121 7 120 180 190 8 130 140 130Example 24 Demonstration of pollen suppressing activity Spring wheat, variety Sicco, was propagated in a glass house in 8 cm pots containing a loam based compost. Supplementary lighting was provided by high pressure mercury vapour lamps to give a constant day length of 16 hours. The temperature was maintained at approximately 20 C. The compounds to be tested were formulated as aqueous solutions containing 0.1 nonidet P 40 trade mark as wetting agent and 1 acetone to aid solubility. These formulations were diluted with water to a concentration of 1000 ppm and sprayed onto plants in a volume equivalent to 650 litres ha. The plants were treated at the growth stage when the second node of the plant was just detectable. At ear emergence but before anthesis., 3 heads from each main stem and 2 heads from the tillers in each pot were placed in cellophane bags to prevent cross pollination. At maturity, the bagged ears were harvested, and seed set was recorded and compared with untreated controls. The results are shown in Table II.
