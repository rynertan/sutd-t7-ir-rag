# Failed fuel detection arrangements.

## Abstract
In the detection of failed fuel in liquid metal cooled nuclear reactors, a helical annular linear induction pump 5,6 electromagnetically pumps coolant in sampling pipes 4 from fuel sub assemblies of the reactor core to a selector mechanism 9,10 which collects, in turn, the discharge from each sampling pipe 4 for supply to equipment for monitor ing for the presence in the coolant of products indicative of fuel failure. The selector mechanism collects the discharge without contacting the sampling pipes 4 and the same pump 5,6 is employed to pump the selected samples via pipe 11 to the monitoring equipment. This pump may also serve to pump a proportion of the bulked sample from the non selected sampling pipes after discharge into a vessel 7 , the bulked sample being conducted through the pump via pipes 13 .
