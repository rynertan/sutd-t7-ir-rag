## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit having redundant portions, and Particularly to a semiconductor memory device having a redundant scheme. Memory capacity of semiconductor memory devices has been remarkably increasing. In accordance with the increase in memory capacity, a number of circuit elements included in each memory chip and within an area of each memory chip are creased. Accordingly, the possibility that at least one defect is present in a memory chip has become large. In order to save such a memory chip having at least one defective memory cell, a redundant scheme has been introduced. According to the redundant scheme, redundant memory cells are fabricated on the same chip on which a normal array of memory cells are formed. In the case where a defective cell or cells are present in the normal array, such defective memory cells are functionally replaced. Thus, even if the memory chip has defects in the normal array, the memory chip can be utilized as a functionally good one. In such a semiconductor memory device incorporating a redundant scheme, it is important to know whether or not the redundant scheme is actually used for replacing defects in the normal array, in view of quality and reliability controls. One approach is to provide a read only memory ROM of a fuse type which indicates whether the redundant scheme is actually used to replace defects in the normal array. For example, US A 4,480,199 proposes such technology. According to this U.S. Patent, a voltage switch circuit and a fuse are connected in series between a power voltage terminal Vcc and one of the external terminals. The fuse is blown out in the case where the redundant scheme is used, and is maintained conductive when the redundant scheme is not used. The programmed state of the fuse is detected by applying a special voltage outside the normal voltage range for the memory device thereby making the voltage switch circuit conductive. Under this condition, when the fuse is kept conductive, a certain amount of current flows from the one of external terminals to the power voltage terminal. On the contrary, in the case where the fuse is blown out, no current flows between the above two terminals even when the special voltage is applied to the one external terminal. However, this technique requires the special voltage which is outside the normal voltage range. Therefore, read process of the state of the fuse is relatively difficult. Furthermore, because of the application of the above special voltage to the one external terminal, an internal circuit connected to this one external terminal is likely to be affected by the special voltage and hence there is caused the possibility that an abnormal current flows into the above internal circuit. In the worst case, elements of the internal circuits would be destroyed by the special voltage. A device according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in EP A 0 052 481. This memory has a state identifying circuit wherein this circuit includes a switching circuit controlled by the power voltage and an addressed signal. The switching circuit necessitates special pads for control or a small value of the power voltage for controlling it. In the former case it is difficult to form such special pads on a highly integrated semiconductor chip. In the latter case it is necessary to apply especially small value of the power voltage to the memory to turn on the switch circuit, and therefore the operating state of the functional circuit itself is adversely affected by such a small power voltage. From EP A 0 086 310 it is known to use a read only memory element for storing the state of a redundant circuit and a means for controlling a switch element in response to this read only memory. According to PATENTS ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN, Volume 8, No. 259 P 317 1696 , 28th November 1984 JP A 59 129 999, it is known to use a fusable link for indicating the state of a memory. In particular, a current path between terminals is cut by the fuse such that breaking of the fuse may be identified from the outside. On the other hand, the fuse requires a relatively large area on the chip, and it is difficult to form a desired resistance of the fuse. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved detection circuit for dectecting the utilized state of a redundant memory in a semiconductor device which can operate without necessity of a special voltage outside the normal operating voltage range. It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved semiconductor memory in which a defective address location can be detected with ease. These objects are achieved by a semiconductor device as defined in the claim. The first and second programmable switching circuits are connected in series between the first and second voltage terminals. The state of the redundant circuit is detected in response to the potential of the control terminal as a change in a power supply current flowing between the first and second voltage terminals. According to the present invention, there is no necessity of a special voltage outside the normal voltage range, and hence easy and reliable detection can be achieved. Fig. 1 shows a conventional read only memory for indicating usage of a redundant scheme. The read only memory DT is composed of a fuse F and diode connected field effect transistors QT1 and QT2 each having a threshold voltage VT which are connected in series between a power voltage terminal and an external terminal EXT. The terminals Vcc and EXT are originally provided for a memory device in which the read only memory DT is formed, and the terminal is connected also to an internal circuit CB included in the memory device. In this arrangement, in the case where a redundant memory cell is used to replace a defective memory cell in a normal memory cell array, the fuse F is blown out in a known way, while in the case the redundant memory cell is not used, the fuse F is kept conductive. This programming of the fuse F is conducted after test of the memory device. In a normal operation, a voltage which is within the normal operation voltage range, i.e. Vcc to a ground GND is applied to the external terminal EXT, and the internal circuit CB performs its function based on the potential at the terminal EXT. In this instance, even when the fuse F is kept conductive, the transistors QT1 and QT2 are maintained non conductive. Therefore, the read only memory DT does not affect the state of the external terminal EXT, and the memory device including the circuit CB performs a normal functional operation. In the case where the state of the fuse F is read out in order to check whether the redundant cell is used to replace a defective cell in the normal array, a higher voltage which is above Vcc 2V However, in this arrangement, the higher voltage must be applied to the external EXT in order to enable the memory DT and the higher voltage is invevitably applied to the internal circuit CB which operates by the normal voltage range of potential at the same time. Accordingly, in addition to uneasiness of preparing the higher voltage itself, there are caused the possibilities that an abnormal current is caused in the internal circuit CB and break down or destruction of elements of the internal circuit CB is caused. Accordingly, this technique of Fig. 1 is not practical. Referring to Fig. 2, an arrangement for indicating the state of the redundant scheme according to a first embodiment of the invention is described. A p channel field effect transistor Q In this arrangement, in the case where the redundant scheme is not used and the normal memory array is completely good the fusable register R is not cut. Therefore, the nodes N₁ and N₂ are set high Vcc and low GND levels, respectively. Under this condition, when the chip select terminal Accordingly, when the terminal In general, a current flowing through the enabled memory device is at a several µA when the memory device is in steady state and at a several mA when a new access cycle is initiated. Therefore, the detection current I Referring to Fig. 3, a second embodiment of the invention is described. A memory device includes a memory section 10 as well as a detection circuit composed of P channel transistor and Q When the external addresses A0 to Ai designate that defective word line, the control circuit 8 then enables the decoder 6 R thereby to select the redundant word line WLR instead of selecting the defective normal word line. In this arrangement, the redundant word line WLR is connected to the gate of the transistor Q When the chip select terminal While, when the redundant word line WLR is selected instead of the defective word line, the transistor Q Accordingly, the selection of the redundant word line is easily detected. Fig. 4 shows a modified embodiment of Fig. 2, as a third embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is achieved by inserting an N channel field effect transistor Q In this arrangement, when the address input Aj is at a high level, the transistor Q Fig. 5 shows a modified embodiment of Fig. 3, as a fourth embodiment of the invention. This embodiment is achieved by inserting an N channel transistor Q Fig. 6 shows a memory device which incorporates the detection circuit 20 of Fig. 4 and the detection circuit 30 of Fig. 5 at the same time. In Fig. 6, the portions corresponding to those in Figs. 4 and 5 are designated by the same references. The buffered signal ₁ of the chip select According to this arrangement, the presence of the replacing redundant scheme and the address of the defective portion can be detected without doubling the detection current I As has been described above, according to the present invention, any special voltage outside the normal operating voltage range is not necessary, and hence easy and reliable detection of the state of the redundant scheme can be conducted.
