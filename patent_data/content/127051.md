# Aluminum resistant ceramic fiber composition.

## Abstract
A ceramic fiber composition for use in contact with molten aluminum alloys is disclosed which is lightweight and porous. The composition contains ceramic fibers, binders and an additive containing 9Al₂O₃ 2B₂O₃. The additive is preferably aluminum boron slag which is a by product of the production of ferro boron.
