## Description
This invention relates to an improved TTL tristate output device with reduced output capacitance, including an enable circuit which generates complementary enable control signals for the TTL tristate output device. A prior art TTL tristate output device with reduced output capacitance is described in the Ferris United States Patent No. 4,311,927 issued January 19, 1982, entitled Transistor Logic Tristate Device with Reduced Output Capacitance . Such prior art tristate output device 10, illustrated in present Fig. 1, is provided with an input 12 for receiving binary data signals Vi of high and low potential and for transmitting output signals Vo to a common bus, not shown, coupled at the tristate device output 14. For operation in the bistate mode, the tristate device includes a pull up transistor element comprising Darlington transistor pair Q2 and Q3 for sourcing current to the output 14 from high potential source Vcc and a pull down transistor element Q4 for sinking current from the output 14 to low potential or ground. Phase splitter transistor element Q1 with collector resistor R1 is coupled at the input 12 to control the states of the pull up and pull down transistor elements in response to data signals Vi at the input. The pull down transistor element Q4 includes a conventional squaring network at its base comprised of transistor Q5 with base and collector resistors R3 and R4. For the tristate mode of operation, a prior art enable gate 20 illustrated in Fig. 2, is operatively coupled at the enable input 15 of tristate device 10. The high impedance third state is established at the output 14 of the tristate device when the enable gate output signal E is at low potential and the pull up and phase splitter transistor elements are deprived of base drive current through diodes D1 and D2. For reducing the effective output capacitance during the high impedance third state, an active discharge sequence consisting of transistors Q7 and Q6 and diode cluster D3, D4, and D5 is operatively coupled between the base of pull down transistor element Q4 and the enable input 15. The active discharge sequence affords a low impedance route to ground from the base of the pull down element through transistor Q7 when the enable gate maintains a low potential enable signal E at enable input 15 and the tristate device is in the high impedance third state. As a result, low to high potential transitions on a common bus coupled at the tristate output 14 will not incidentally drive the pull down transistor element Q4 to conduction. Any capacitive Miller feedback current through the collector to base capacitance of transistor Q4 is rapidly diverted and discharged to ground through active discharge transistor element Q7. During the bistate mode of operation when the enable signal E is at high potential, the active discharge sequence blocks current flow from high potential to the pull down transistor element Q4. The active discharge sequence as described in United States Patent No. 4,311,927 comprises a sequence of three active element transistors in a double inversion series coupling between the enable gate and the base of the pull down transistor. As a result of the double inversion, the collector potential of the active discharge transistor coupled at the base of the pull down transistor element follows in phase the high or low potential of the enable signal E, discharging the base of the pull down transistor when the enable signal E is at low potential and the tristate device 10 is in the high impedance third state. In the circuit of Fig. 1, one of the transistors in the active discharge sequence next to the enable input 15 is replaced with the passive diode cluster D3, D4, D5, coupled in a delta configuration and power supply resistors R5, R6, R7 coupled in a Y network. The passive diode cluster is operatively arranged for delivering base drive current to the base of the second transistor Q6 thereby depriving the active discharge transistor Q7 of base drive current when the enable signal E at the enable input 15 is at high potential for operation of the tristate device in the bistate mode. The passive diode cluster also operatively diverts base drive current away from the base of the second transistor Q6 when the enable signal E is at low potential so that active discharge transistor Q7 actively conducts away from the base of the pull down transistor Q4 for operation of the device with reduced output capacitance during the high impedance third state. In either case there is double inversion. The collector potential of transistor Q6 follows out of phase with the enable signal potential E, and the collector potential of active discharge transistor Q7 follows in phase requiring two inversions of the enable signal E. The silicon area taken up by the active discharge sequence in either of the prior art tristate devices with low output capacitance is relatively large and this large area is multiplied when many tristate devices are tied to a common bus. Furthermore, either tristate device consumes power during bistate operation of the output device. The prior art enable gate 20 shown in Fig. 2 is a bistate device with generates the enable signal E at enable gate output 16 from an enable gate input signal A prior art TTL internal buffer circuit for generating complementary data signals such as true and false data signals D and A schematic block diagram of this conventional buffer circuit for generating true and false data signals is illustrated in Fig. 4. The TTL bistate buffer 30 is inherently inverting at the output 36. The dual phase splitter Q31a is also inherently inverting at its collector 31a which is tapped to provide the complementary inputs Document WO A 83 03934 discloses a TTL gate for producing complementary enable and alternate enable signals from an input signal, including pull up and pull down transistors, a phase splitter transistor, an input transistor and an alternate enable transistor. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide enable gates and improved TTL tristate output devices with reduced output capacitance having faster operation, reduced integrated circuit fabrication area, and reduced power consumption. The invention also provides internal IC buffer circuits which generate complementary data signals without the disadvantage of current hogging experienced in conventional dual phase splitter buffer circuits. In order to accomplish these results the present invention provides the features set forth in patent claim 1. These include an improved enable gate for generating complementary enable signals E and A from an enable gate input signal In a preferred embodiment the alternate enable transistor element comprises a second input transistor coupled in emitter follower configuration with the base of the second input transistor element tied to the base of the first input transistor element. Thus, the bases of the first and second input transistors are coupled to follow the enable input signal A voltage level shifting component is preferably coupled in the emitter circuit of the alternate enable transistor element in the improved enable gate so that the impedance of the current path of enable signal E through the enable gate and the impedance of the current path of the alternate enable signal A through the alternate enable transistor element emitter circuit are substantially equal. The voltage level shifting component in the emitter circuit of the alternate enable transistor element may comprise, for example, at least one diode. The invention provides the improved TTL tristate output device with reduced output capacitance incorporating the enable gate as briefly described above. The tristate output device includes the conventional features of an output, a bistate mode of operation, a pull down transistor element for sinking current from the output to low potential, an enable input for establishing a high impedance third state at the output of the tristate device, and an active discharge transistor element coupled to the base of the pull down transistor for providing a route to ground when the active discharge transistor element is conducting. According to the invention the enable signal E at the improved enable gate output is coupled to the enable input of the tristate device and the alternate enable signal A from the emitter circuit of the alternate enable transistor element of the improved enable gate is coupled to the base of the active discharge transistor element in the tristate device through a limiting resistor. Miller feedback current through the collector to base capacitance of the pull down transistor element caused by low to high potential transitions on the common bus is rapidly diverted and discharged to ground through the conducting active discharge transistor element. A feature and advantage of the TTL tristate output device with reduced output capacitance, according to the invention, is that the double inversion active discharge sequence is replaced by a single active discharge transistor thereby increasing the speed of operation of the device, greatly reducing the required silicon fabrication area for reducing the output capacitance for IC tristate devices, and eliminating power consumption by active discharge elements during the bistate mode of operation.

Fig. 6 is a block diagram of an enable gate according to the present invention for generating complementary enable signals for the TTL tristate output device of Fig. 5. Fig. 6A is a schematic diagram of an alternative embodiment of the new enable gate for generating complementary enable control signals. An improved TTL tristate output device 50 with reduced output capacitance according to the present invention is illustrated in Fig. 5. The new tristate device 50 of Fig. 5 incorporates the primary operational elements and features heretofore described with reference to the prior art tristate device 10 of Fig. 1 and the same operating components are designated by the same reference numerals and letter designations. However, a feature and advantage of the present invention is that the double inversion active discharge sequence has been eliminated. In its place the present invention provides the single active discharge transistor element Q7 at the base of pull down transistor Q4. Active discharge transistor Q7 provides a low impedance path to ground from the base of pull down transistor Q4 for reducing the effective output capacitance when the enable signal E is at low potential and the tristate device 50 is in the high impedance third state. This is accomplished by applying an alternate enable control signal A complementary to the enable signal E to the base of active discharge transistor Q7 at alternate enable input 55 through limiting resistor R56. According to the invention the alternate enable signal A is derived from an improved enable gate illustrated in Fig. 6. The enable gate of Fig. 6 incorporates the primary operational elements and features described with reference to the prior art enable gate 20 of Fig. 2 and the same operating components are designated by the same reference numerals and letter designations. In the improved enable gate of Fig. 6, however, an alternate enable circuit portion 60 is incorporated in the enable gate including an alternate enable transistor element 26 coupled in emitter follower configuration with the base of alternate enable transistor Q26 coupled to follow in phase with the enable gate input signal In the preferred embodiment the alternate enable transistor element Q26 forms a second input transistor but coupled in emitter follower configuration with the base tied to the base of the first input transistor Q28. The bases of both transistors therefore follow in phase the enable input signal However, for smaller current applications where fewer output devices are controlled by the alternate enable signal A, the alternate enable circuit portion 60 may be coupled in emitter follower configuration at any of the stages of the enable gate, for example, as shown in Fig. 6A. In Fig. 6A is illustrated an enable gate of the type shown in Fig. 6, however the alternate enable circuit portion 60A is tied to the second stage of phase splitter transistor Q21 of the enable gate. Thus, alternate enable transistor element Q26 is coupled in emitter follower configuration to follow in phase the enable gate input signal E with the base of emitter follower Q26 tied to the base of phase splitter transistor element Q21. Voltage level shifting diode D23 couples the emitter circuit of emitter follower Q26 to the alternate enable terminal or node 55 and is separated from ground by leakage resistor R27 as heretofore described. A feature and advantage of the emitter follower configurations 60 and 60A according to the present invention is that the emitter circuit and signal path of the alternate enable signal A follows in phase with the enable gate input signal Thus, as shown in Fig. 5 an alternate enable signal A of high potential may be applied directly to drive the base of active discharge transistor Q7 when the enable signal E at enable input 15 is at low potential and the tristate output device is in the high impedance third state. In this condition active discharge transistor Q7 is conducting providing a low impedance path to ground for diverting and dissipating Miller feedback current at the pull down transistor element Q24 caused by potential transitions on the common bus. This is accomplished according to the present invention by reaching back into a preferred stage of the enable gate with an emitter follower alternate enable transistor element and emitter circuit which follows in phase the enable gate input signal The limiting resistor or stabilizing resistor R56 at the base of active discharge transistor Q7 is required for stabilizing operation of the emitter follower alternate enable circuit of the present invention. Limiting resistor R56 moderates the potential at the alternate enable signal node or terminal 55, limits current to the base of active discharge transistor Q7, and prevents damage to the transistor which may otherwise occur by use of the emitter follower configuration. Stabilizing resistor R56 may be selected typically in the order of 200 ohms.
