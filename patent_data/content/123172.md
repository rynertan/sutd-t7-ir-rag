# A mixer tap.

## Abstract
A mixer tap has a body 2 which can be produced by turning, drilling and tapping machinery operations from brass bar stock. An axial water intake bore 16 and another axial water intake bore not shown intersect inlet bores 22 and 21 respectively so that the water can pass through annular seats 23 which co operate with closure members 26 into control bores 18 and 19 . A connection bore 24 from the control bore 19 leads to a third bore 14 of an outlet cavity which receives a spout 7 to pass into an inner conduit of the spout 7 . A further connection bore not shown leads from the control bore 19 to a first bore 3 of the outlet cavity to pass into an outer conduit 5 of the spout 7 . A first plane which passes through the axes of both of the axial water intake bores 16 and another is at an acute angle to a second plane which includes the longitudinal axis of the body 2 and the axis of one of the control bores 18, 19 .

## Description
A MIXER TAP The invention relates to a mixer tap provided with a single outlet spout for water. Such mixer taps comprise a body provided with two water intake apertures, one for hot water and the other for cold water, and flow ducts for the hot and the cold water to flow to two distribution apertures which each feed the spout. Such taps also comprise cpntrol means for closing off and regulating the flow section of each of the flow ducts. In general, the body of such taps is advantageously produced by casting, which makes it possible for the production of shapes which are often very complicated, with the minimum amount of machining and therefore as inexpensively as possible. However, casting equipement is very bulky and burdensome so that small or medium size tap and plumbing fitting manufacturers either have to have their casting done outside or they have to use other production methods such as for example cutting or turning. According to the invention there is provided a mixer tap, comprising a body, a spout engaged in the body and two transverse control bores in the body, in which the body is machined from a solid bar of material and has a longitudinal axis, one end of the body has two water intake bores therein with the axes of the water intake bores parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body and a first plane which includes the axes of the water intake bores forms an acute angle with a second plane which includes the longitudinal axis of the body and the axis of one of the control bores. Such a mixer tap can be produced by turning and other simple cutting operations and the overall design of and the layout of the bores therein can permit a reduction in the outside dimensions of the body. The invention is diagrammatically illustrated by way of example in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal section, taken on lineI I in Figure 5, of a body of a mixer tap according to the invention Figure 2 is also a longitudinal section of the body of the mixer tap of Figure 1, but illustrating the other half thereof, and including part of a spout and part of one control closure member Figure 3 is a view taken in the direction of arrowA of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a partly sectioned view of the body taken in the direction of arrow B of Figure 1 Figure 5 is a plan view of the body of Figure 1 Figure 6 is an underneath plan view of the body of Figure 1 Figure 7 is a view of part of the body in section taken on line II II in Figure 6 and Figure 8 is a view in section taken on line IIIIII in Figure 2 but omitting the control closure member. A cylindrical body 1 of the mixer tap has, for aesthetic reasons, an upper frusto conical portion 2.The top face of the body 1 has an outlet cavity therein formed by bores of three different diameters. A first bore 3 of largest diameter receives the end 7 of a spout having two separate conduits 5 and 6. The end 7 of the spout has a first part 8 which engages in the first bore 3, and is held in position in an axial direction by a screw which is screwed into a threaded transverse bore 4 in the wall of the portion 2 of the body 1 and which engages in a peripheral groove 9 provided in the first part 8 of the spout. The first part 8 has a second peripheral groove 10 therein for receiving a toric seal. The lower part of the first part 8 has two flat faces 11, formed by milling, as indicated in Figure 8.The end 7 of the spout also comprises a second part 12 provided with a peripheral groove for receiving a seal and engaged in a second bore 13 of the outlet cavity in the body 1, coaxial with but of smaller diameter than the first bore 3.Finally, a third bore 14 of the cavity formed in the body 1 comprises a blind coaxial bore which is of smaller diameter than the second bore 13. By virtue of the particular end 7 of the spout, the inner conduit 6 of the spout is in communication only with the third bore 14 in the body while the outer conduit 5 is in communication only with the first bore 3 of the cavity by virtue of the flat faces 11. The three bores 3, 13 and 14 of the cavity in the body 1 are coaxial with the longitudinal axis of the body 1 and occupy the upper part thereof. A lower part of the body 1 has a cylindrical screwthreaded recess 15 in the bottom of which are formed two water intake bores 16 and 17 for receiving the ends of respective water intake conduits, for hot water and cold water respectively, or vice versa. A middle portion of the body 1 has two control bores 18 and 19 therein, the axes of which are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body 1, and which are screwthreaded for receiving fixing collars 20 of taps. The control bores 18 and 19 are connected by inlet bores 21 and 22 to the water intake bores 17 and 16 which are respectively connected to the water intake conduits. In each control bore there is an annular portion 23, which may be raised, around the inlet bores 21 and 22, forming a seat for a flow regulating closure member 26 controlled by a control member not shown mounted in a cap member 27 which is secured by the respective fixing collar 20. The control bore 19 is connected to the third bore 14 of the cavity in the body, and therefore to the inner conduit 6 of the spout, by a connection bore 24 while the control bore 18 is connected to the first bore 3 of the cavity in the body 1 by a connection bore 25 and therefore to the outer conduit 5. The axis of the connection bore 24 is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body 1 whereas the axis of the connection bore 25 is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body 1. In the illustrated embodiment, the control bores 18 and 19 are coaxial but in alternative embodiments, the axes of the control bores may be at an angle to each other. In contrast, one of the original features of this embodiment, and which makes it possible to minimise the outside diameter of the body 1, is that a first plane including the axes of the water intake bores 16 and 17 is always at an angle to a second plane which includes both the longitudinal axis of the body 1 and the axis of one of the control bores 18, 19.In fact, it is only by virtue of that particular arrangement that the communications between the water intake bore 17 and the inner conduit 6 of the spout and the water intake bore 16 and the outer conduit 5 of the spout respectively may be formed by means of simple machining operations, with a minimum diameter in respect of the body 1 As will be seen, the water intake bore 16 and the inlet bore 22 communicate since they partially intersect, so that water which is introduced at the bore 16 passes into the control bore 18 if the respective closure member 26 is in an open condition. From the control bore 18, the water then passes by way of the connection bore 25 into the first bore 3 of the cavity, which first bore 3, due to the flat faces 11, communicates with the outer conduit 5 of the spout. Likewise, since the water intake bore 17 partially intersects the inlet bore 21, water which is introduced at the bore 17 passes into the control bore 19. If the respective closure member 26 is in an open condition, that water passes by way of the connection bore 24 to the third bore 14 which communicates with the inner conduit 6 of the spout. The hot and cold waters are therefore completely separated. In the illustrated embodiment, the two control bores 18 and 19 are coaxial and the angle between the longitudinal plane passing through the axis of the control bores 18 and 19 and the longitudinal plane passing through the axes of the two water intake bores 16 and 17 is preferably 450 In alternative embodiments, it is possible to achieve the desired result, namely a body which is of a simple form, being produced by simple machining operations from solid portions of small diameter, so long as the longitudinal plane containing the axes of the two water intake bores 16 and 17 is at an acute angle to the axis of at least one of the arms 20. The body 1 can be produced by simple machining operations from brass bar stock. The layout of the bores of the body in particular can be such that it can be easily produced, that is to say, the machining operations need only involve drilling, tapping and turning, and the diameter of the brass bar from which it is machined can be small so as to economise on material.
