## Description
This invention generically refers to the combustion motor art and the invention is particularly concerned with a novel and original method for obtaining stoichiometric combustion and thereby permitting fuel consumption to be lowered and the exhaust gas quality to be improved in twostroke Otto motors of the high efficiency type. It is generally known on the field of piston motor technique that an increase of the temperature level in the combustion space involves an increase of the thermal efficiency and in addition a more complete combustion and, due to this, an improved exhaust gas quality. A method of additionally increasing this temperature subsequent to achieving stoichiometric combustion conditions comprises insulating the combustion space walls by various means thereby to reduce heat discharge. An example of this is decribed in US specificationNo. 3 911 891 explaining how walls and bottom may be insulated in order to achieve increased combustion space temperatures.However, in practice it appears to be very difficult to deal with the shear tensions appearing during changes of temperature in the boundary surfaces between the layers mentioned in said US specification, in particular during production.Due to the high requirements regarding process supervision the method is expensive and there is still a considerable risk of breakage in the finished product due to so called separation. Considering the high cost the method described in the above mentioned US specification appears to be less attractive for four stroke Otto motors in which maximum leanness can be achieved in most cases anybow. As far as two stroke Otto motors of the high efficiency type are concerned, as in modern outboard motors, in most cases more than the optimum amount of fuel must be added in order to lower the temperature and to reduce the thermal strain on the pistons which are the most exposed parts. Just in this type of motor, however, an essential saving of fuel can thus be made if the pistons could be protected against excessive temperature. In accordance with the present invention the deleterious shear strains are minimized by causing the plasma sprayed layer of material, preferably metal, having a temperature expansion coefficient comparable to the piston material, continously to merge into the insulating, preferably ceramic layer without any distinct boundary. In practice, this can be achieved in several ways, for example with the aid of double powder feeders which at a defined total flow operate under a phase shift from 100 per cent of the one material to 100 per cent of the other material. Additionally the shear strain is minimized by spraying the material so thinly that the most recently sprayed material only forms small islands on the previously deposited material.In this case the shear tension is not summed up between the islands as is the case within the islands or within a more homogeneous layer. In practice, this can be achieved for example beholding the lateral feed velocity during the coating operation at a sufficiently high value. The remaining characteristic features of the invention will appear from the attached claims. In the added drawing there is illustrated a piston end face seen in vertical section and arranged in accordance with the invention. In piston 1 illustrated on the drawing the piston top portion 2 in the normal way is provided with a groove 3 adapted to receive a piston ring. The upper surface of the piston top 2 is suitably provided with a depression in which a coating 4, 5, 6 according to the invention is received. The coating operation is suitably performed by so called plasma spraying which is a coating method well known within this technical field. Said plasma spraying is performed during relative translational movement between the plasma spray gun and the piston. In accordance with this invention this plasma spraying during the coating operation is to be performed with a translational velocity chosen so that during every passage only partial surface coverage is obtained.Hereby the formation of completely covering layers with consequential risk for separation is avoided, islands or patches being obtained by proper adaptation of the translational velocity in accordance with the invention. According to the invention the piston end faces during the coating operation are initially provided with a coating 4 adjacent the piston top 2, said first coating 4 comprising a metallic material having a coefficient of extension comparable to that of the piston material. It is extremely essential for the present invention that the process subsequent ly comprises a continuous transition into an insulating coating 6, preferably of ceramic type. This can be obtained in many different ways, for example by using double powder feeders which under defined total flows operate at a phase shift from 100 per cent of the metallic coating material to 100 per cent of the ceramic insulating coating. Hereby an intermediate layer 5 is formed in which adjacent the piston top the metallic material 4 dominates whereas the ceramic insulating material is the dominating component farther outwardly towards the insulating ceramic coating. The invention also comprises a piston having a piston top provided with a coating applied in accordance with the process of the present invention. The expert on the field will realize that many variations and modifications of the invention are il1aginable within the frame of the attached claims.
