## Description
Transistor inverter device The present invention relates to a transistor inverter device and more particularly, a transistor inverter device capable of reducing power loss. The conventional transistor inverter device for inverting DC voltage supplied from a power source such as battery to AC voltage has such arrangement as shown in Fig. 1. When Åa switch S is closed, voltage is applied from a DC voltage source E to a collector tuning oscillator circuit which comprises a transistor Tr, primary windings L1, L2 of an oscillating transformer T, and a capacitor C1, and AC voltage is generated between both ends of primary windings L1, L2 and secondary winding L3. The frequency of this AC voltage output can be made variable by adjusting the inductance of a variable inductor L4 which is combined with a capacitorC2 to form a resonance circuit. Resistors R1 and R2 serve to give bias to transistor Tr. Fig. 2 A shows voltage waveform between the collector and the emitter of transistor Tr and Fig. 2 B the collector current waveform of transistor Tr. In the case of circuit shown in Fig. 1, surplus charge flows from the collector to the base of transistor Tr when this transistor Tr is turned on by setting values of capacitor C2 and variable inductor L4 to predetermined ones, and the flow of this surplus charge is broken, when transistor Tr is turned off, to generate inductive voltage in variable inductor L4.This inductive voltage acts on transistor Tr as reverse bias to accelerate the non continuity operation of transistor Tr. In the case of transistor inverter device having such conventional arrangement as shown in Fig. 1, however, collector current of transistor Tr rises at the same time when transistor Tr is turned on and then increases progressively to form a substantially rectangular wave, as shown in Fig. 2 B . Therefore, collector current having an enough peak value P1 can not be obtained. Surplus charge flowing from the collector to the base of transistor Tr is therefore relatively small and inductive voltage generated in inductor L4 due to the breaking of this current is also small. This makes it difficult to contribute the turn off of transistor Tr. The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a transistor inverter device capable of reducing power loss by shortening the turn off time of transistor. This object can be achieved by a transistor inverter device comprising a DC power source a transistor for switching this DC power source a transformer having at least an input winding, an output winding and a base winding, said input winding being arranged in series with the collector and emitter of transistor and said base winding being arranged between the base and the emitter of transistor a capacitor arranged to com bine with the transistor to form a parallel resonance circuit and an inductor arranged between the base of transistor and the base winding, said inductor serving to allow a part of collector current flowing immediately before the transistor is turned off to flow therethrough, to generate inductive voltage according to the magnitude of this current allowed to flow therethrough, and to apply this inductive voltage between the base and the emitter of transistor as reverse bias. As described above, the present inventionis so constructed as to generate reverse electromotive force in the inductor according to the magnitude of collector current flowing through the resonance circuit which comprises the transformer and the capacitor when the transistor is changed from on condition to offcondition, and to apply this electromotive force to the transistor as reverse bias. According to the present invention, therefore, reverse bias voltage of enough magnitude can be obtained and the turn off time of transistor can be shortened, so that a transistor inverter device of small power loss and high efficiency can be provided. By way of example and to make the description clearer, reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram showing the conventional transistor inverter device, Figs. 2 A and 2 B show the waveform of voltage appearing between the collector and the emitter of transistor Tr and the waveform of collector current flowing through the transistor, respectively, in the transistor inverter device shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram showing an embodiment of transistor inverter device according to the present invention Figs. 4A through 4F are waveform diagrams used to explain the operation of circuit shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram showing another embodiment of transistor inverter device according to the present invention. A first embodiment of the present invention will now be described referring to the drawings. Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram showing the first example of transistor inverter device according to the present invention. The positive terminal of a DC power source 10 is connected to one end of a capacitor 12. Battery, rectifying and smoothing power source of AC voltage, non smoothing power source or the like may be used as DC power source 10. The other end of capacitor 12 is connected to the collector of an NPN type transistor 14. Capacitor 12 is further connected between both ends of an input winding 161 of an autotransformer 16 to form a first resonance circuit 17, which determines the off time of transistor 14. A discharg lamp 20 is connected, as a load, between both ends of an output winding 162 of autotransformer 16 through a current limiting inductor 18.One end of a base winding 163 of autotransformer 16 is connected to the emitter of transistor 14. The base winding 163 is arranged to magnetically combine with input winding 161. The other end of base winding 163 is connected via a capacitor 22 and an inductor 24 to the base of transistor 14 to apply between the base and the emitter of transistor 14 bias voltage according to the voltage of input winding 161. Capacitor 22 and inductor 24 form a second resonance circuit 26, which determines the on time of transistor 14. A series circuit of a diode 28 and a resistor 30 is connected parallel to capacitor 22 to apply DC bias voltage between the base and the emitter of transistor 14. During the operation of the inverter, the series circuit can supply current from base winding 163 as base current through inductor 24 to the base of transistor 14, minimizing the power loss. The series circuit may be omitted, because, at the time of starting and during the operation, DC power source 10 can supply base current to the base of transistor 14 through a resistor 32 and inductor 24.The operation of this transistor inverter device is started by closing a switch 34. When switch 34 is closed, base current is supplied from DC power source 10 to transistor 14 through resistor 32 and inductor 24 to render transistor 14 conductive. As the result, voltage is applied from DC power source 10 to input winding 161 through transistor 14. Figs. 4A through 4F show waveforms of voltage and current appearing at main sections at the time when transistor 14 is turned on. TON represents the time period during which transistor 14 is under on condition while TOFF the time period during which transistor 14 is under off condition. Referring to Figs. 4A through 4F, the operation of this transistor inverter device will be now described in more detail. When transistor 14 is turned on, voltageVCE appearing between the collector and the emitter thereof is in about zero level, as shown in Fig. 4A.Collector current IC increases linearly during the time period TON, as shown in Fig. 4B. The waveform of collector current in the conventional inverter device is trapezoidal while that in this embodiment of the present inventionis triangular. This is because the embodiment of the present invention has the parallel resonance circuit 17 which comprises capacitor 12 and transformer 16, while the conventional one shown in Fig. 1 has not such a resonance circuit. In the case where current of same magnitude is supplied to the collector of transistor 14, collector current whose waveform is triangular enables a higher peak value P2 to be obtained as shown in Fig. 4B.At the instant when transistor 14 is changed from offcondition to on condition, first resonance circuit 17 has extremely large impedance to make collector current of about zero level. Collector current is then supplied through input winding 161, linearly increasing according to the lapse of time. Fig. 4C shows the waveform of voltage VN1 appearing through input winding l61 and this waveform is symmetrical to the collector emitter voltage waveform shown in Fig. 4A. Voltage VNl inducted in input winding 161 when transistor 14 is turned on equals to the voltage supplied from DC power source 10.Fig. 4D shows the waveform of voltage VN1 appearing between both ends of base winding 163 and this waveform corresponds to voltage waveform shown in Fig. 4C. At the instant when transistor 14 is changed from off condition to on condition and forward direction bias voltage is applied from base winding 163, this voltage is applied to inductor 24 through capacitor 22 and inductor 24 generates electromotive force VID equal to this voltage applied, as shown in Fig. 4E. The scale of voltage shown in Fig. 4E is enlarged for easier understanding as compared with those shown in Figs. 4A, 4C and 4D. Since transistor 14 is biased in forward direction through inductor 24, base current 1B shown inFig. 4F is allowed to flow. Capacitor 22 is charged according to the lapse of time and base current 1B decreases accordingly. Even after voltage VID of inductor 24 reaches zero level, base current 1B decreases in negative direction due to its resonance with capacitor 22.On the other hand, surplus charge injected into the base region of transistor 14 is drawn toward inductor 24. The magnitude of current due to this surplus charge has a close relation relative to the magnitude of collector current. When surplus charge is present in the base region, collector current still continues to increase as shown in Fig. 4B even if base current 1B flows in negative direction as shown in Fig. 4F. At the instant when no surplus charge becomes present in the base region, base current 1B disappears and transistor 14 is suddenly changed from on condition to offcondition. Since base current 1B is suddenly stopped, a large reverse electromotive force VID is generated in inductor 24 as shown in Fig. 4E.Since this reverse electromotive force is applied, as reverse bias, between the base and the emitter of transistor 14, the switching operation of transistor 14 from on condition to offcondition is accelerated. The on time of transistor 14 can be varied by adjusting the inductance of inductor 24 and the capacitance of capacitor 22. Since larger reverse electromotive force can be obtained in inductor 24 as the peak value of collector current flowing at the time when the transistor is under no condition becomes larger, the embodiment of the present. invention enables the switching speed of transistor 14 to be made extremely higher as compared with that attained by the conventional inverter device. Therefore, power loss at the time when transistor 14 is changed from on to offcondition can be reduced to a larger extent as compared with that in the conventional inverter device.In addition, inrush current into the base of transistor 14 at the time when transistor 14 is turned on can be suppressed by the inductor 24. When transistor 14 is switched like this from oncondition to off condition, above mentioned main sections show such waveforms of current and voltage as shown in Figs. 4A through 4F. When transistor 14 is turned off, collector current becomes of zero level as shown in Fig. 4B. Voltage between the collector and the emitter of transistor 14 is determined by the ratio of impedance of first resonance circuit 16 to that between the collector and the emitter of transistor 14 and becomes as shown in Fig. 4A. The off time of transistor 14 can be varied be adjusting the inductance of input winding 161 and the capacitance of capacitor 12. When transistor 14 is under off condition, voltage VID of inductor 24 connected to the base and base current 1B are in about zero level.Voltage VB generated through base winding 163 decreases in negative direction as shown inFig. 4D and then increases in positive direction. When this voltage VB reaches forward direction bias voltage between the base and the emitter of transistor 14, transistor 14 is switched from off condition to oncondition. Voltage generated in base winding 163 thus biases the transistor deeply in forward direction again to accelerate the switching operation of transistor 14 from off condition to on condition. The above described operation is repeated and voltage having high frequency of several tens kHz, for example, and boosted Is generated in output winding 162 of autotransformer 16 and supplied to discharg lamp 20. It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the above described embodiment. Although collector emitter current of transitor 14 flows through base winding 163, the embodiment may be arranged so as not to allow collector emitter current to flow through base winding 163. NPN type transistor 14 may be replaced by a PNP type transistor. Since the polarity of transistor is reverse in this case, the circuit must be changed accordingly. Capacitor 12 of first resonance circuit 17 is connected between both ends of input winding 161, but it may be connected between both ends of output winding 162. Discharg lamp 20 is used as a load, but other resistance or reactance load may be employed. Autotransformer 16 employed in the embodiment may be replaced by an insulation type transformer 40 having primary and secondary windings as shown inFig. 5.The arrangement of another embodiment shown in Fig. 5 is fundamentally the same as that shown inFig. 3 and same parts as those in Fig. 3 are therefore represented by same reference numerals. Capacitor 12 is connected between both ends of a primary winding 401 of insulation type transformer 40 and the discharg lamp 20 is connected between both ends of a secondary winding 402. One end of a base winding 403 is connected to the emitter of transistor 14 through capacitor 22 while the other end thereof to the base of transistor 14 through inductor 24. This second embodiment thus arranged also achieves the same effect as that attained by the first embodiment shown in Fig. 3. Capacitor 22 arranged in series with inductor 24 may be omitted in the present invention and the on time of transistor is determined by other well known means in this case. No resistor for suppressing parasitic oscillation is arranged in embodiments of the present invention but a parasitic oscillation suppressing resistor 36 may be arranged parallel to inductor 24 as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 3. Resistor 36 may be positioned otherwise in series with capacitor 22, for example. It should be understood that various changes and modifications can be made without departing the scope and spirit of the present invention.
