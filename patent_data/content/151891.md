# Cut off style, roll thread flat dies.

## Abstract
A cut off style, roll thread flat die for use with a matched cut off style, roll thread flat die to form a threaded, pointed fastener such as a gimlet point screw, the cut off style, roll thread flat die having a top operating surface comprising body threads, point threads, a slug traction ramp to provide controlled rotation for the cut off slug and a slug extrusion taper to provide proper extrusion of the cut off slug from the fastener, the slug traction ramp and the slug extrusion taper extending in side by side relation from a start location, past a transition location to a termination location, the slug traction ramp and the slug extrusion taper having a common edge and thereby being laterally continuous from the start loca tion to the transition location, the slug extrusion taper forming an obtruse angle with the slug traction ramp from the start location to the transition location, the edge of the slug extrusion taper adjacent the slug traction ramp being substantially vertically spaced above the edge of the slug traction ramp adjacent the slug extrusion taper from the transition location to the termination location, the spacing continuously increasing from the transition location to the termination location, the slug extrusion taper having a selected and constant angle of inclination, and the slug traction ramp having a selected and constant orientation.
