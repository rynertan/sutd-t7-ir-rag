# Device for developing latent electrostatic image.

## Abstract
A latent electrostatic image developing device compris ing a developer receptacle 16 for holding a developer com posed of carrier particles and toner particels, a developer applicator means 18 for holding part of the developer in the developer receptacle 16 on its surface and carrying it to a developing zone 34 , a developer agitating means 46 , a toner particle receptacle 88 for holding toner particles 86 and a toner particle feed means 92 for feeding the toner particles from the toner particle receptacle 88 to the developer receptacle 16 . The developer agitating means 46 has a plurality of agitating blades 52 extending in the width wise direction, and a cut 56 is formed in at least some of the agitating blades. The developing device also has a developer detector 80 for detecting the concentration of the developer, and the developer detector 80 detects the concentration of the excess of the developer removed from the developer applicator means. The developing device also has a partition ing plate 70 for conducting the excess of the developer removed from the developer applicator means 18 to the agitating means 46 . The agitating means 46 moves the developer from one side toward the other side, and the parti tioning plate 70 moves the developer removed from the developer applicator means 18 form said other side toward said one side.
