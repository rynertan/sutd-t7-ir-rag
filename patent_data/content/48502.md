# Apparatus for printing and dispensing labels.

## Abstract
A label applicator for self adhesive labels is disclosed. The applicator includes cam tracks 42,44 which control the orientation of two pivotal print heads 20,22 during motion from a rest position to a printing position. The print heads are mounted on levers 28 pivoted in the casing so that motion of the print heads takes place about two pivot centres 24, 26 and 29 . A rotary inking roller 62,64 is positioned along the path of the operative facets 34 of each print head and inking takes place during movement of the corresponding print head 20,22 to ensure contact during one part of the cycle and avoid such contact during the return. The roller 62,64 acts as a part of the cam track 42,44 . The inking action is such that the roller 62,64 is rotated by the operative facets 34 . At the instant inking takes place, a part 46 of the cam track serves to prevent lateral motion of those print facets. The invention can be applied to label applicators or dispensers wherever there is a need for high quality printing on labels.
