# Channel subsystem.

## Abstract
A channel communicator CC has a storage array for holding an entry for each channel and for holding a busy vector and an interrupt vector that each have a bit for each channel. The channel communicator CC is connected between the input bus and the output bus that connect the channels and an I O processor IOP to processor main store. A message to the channel communicator CC includes the identification ID of the channel that the message is to or from and the channel communicator CC uses this identifica tion ID as an address for accessing a channel entry or a bit in a vector. The message also carries a command that controls the channels communicator CC to store a data portion of a message or to fetch a channel entry or a vector from the array and load it onto the output bus addressed to the I O processor IOP or to one of the channels. The command also controls addressing a particular one of the vectors. The channel communicator CC also has means responsive to a command to perform a sequence of opera tions for testing the vectors and for testing fields of an entry in the array and for using the results of the test to control the execution of the command.
