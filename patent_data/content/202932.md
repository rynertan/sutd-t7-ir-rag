# MATERIAL APPLICATOR ASSEMBLY AND WIPER THEREFOR

## Abstract
A material applicator assembly, which is particularly suit able for use with cosmetics materials. The assembly compris es an elongate applicator, a container for the material to be applied by the applicator and a wiper unit having a wiping orifice for wiping a material retaining portion of the applicator as it is withdrawn from the container so as to limit the amount of material retained thereon. A cleaning member is provided which is adapted to project inwardly relative to the orifice and penetrate an inner part of said material retaining portion to aid the removal of material from said inner part. The cleaning member may comprise a toothed leg which depends from the wiper unit, or projects upwardly or inwardly from, respectively, the base or sidewall of the container. There may be a number of circumferentially spaced de pending legs which slant inwardly toward the wiper orifice axis to penetrate the material retaining portion, on withdrawal of the applicator, at correspondingly spaced positions. The shaft of the applicator is preferably recessed to accommodate such legs unflexed in the inserted position of the applicator.
