# Distortion reducing circuit for an FM receiver.

## Abstract
A distortion reducing circuit in an FM receiver com prises a distortion detector 9 for receiving the output of an FM demodulating circuit 7 . The distortion detector 9 com prises a high pass filter, the output of which is applied to a capacitor 223 so that the latter is rapidly charged. The con ductivity of a transistor 229 or 231 is changed as a function of the charge voltage across the capacitor 223 . The tran sistor 229 or 231 and a capacitor 233 or 235 connected in series therewith are connected between the demodulated receiver output and ground. Thus, a high frequency com ponent in the output of the FM demodulating circuit is re duced by an increase in the conductivity of the transistor 229 or 231 .
