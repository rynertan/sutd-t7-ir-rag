# FIBER OPTIC CONNECTOR

## Abstract
A fiber optic connector includes a connector assembly for connecting a fiber optic cable thereto. The connector assem bly includes an arrangement whereby the cable can be crimped and attached to the connector without crimping force being exerted on the buffer layer of the cable. The connecting end of the connector has the capillary ferrule extending out wardly therefrom in a spring loaded manner. In connection with another connector the respective ferrules are held in a centering sleeve and retract against the compressive force of a spring into each connector thereof to ensure alignment and tight connection between the core elements held by the fer rules. In order to permit repeat connections, the ferrules are held non rotatively within the connectors. Further compen sating means in the form of a compensating sleeve having a predetermined temperature coefficient of expansion is pro vided for ensuring that the fiber core of the cable is main tained flush with the end of the capillary ferrule at all times and under varying temperature conditions.
