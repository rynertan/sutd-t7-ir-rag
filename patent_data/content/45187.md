# A process for enzymatic replacement of the B 30 amino acid in insulins.

## Abstract
A process for enzymatic replacement of the B 30 amino acid in insulins, in which the insulin Ins X, wherein Ins repre sents the insulin molecule except for X which represents the B 30 amino acid, is reacted with an amine component selected from amino acids, and their amides and esters, of the formulae H B OH H B NR¹R² H O OR³ H B SR³ H B SeR³ wherein B is an amino acid residue either R¹ and R² are independently selected from hydrogen, amino, hydroxy, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl and aralkyl or NR¹R² is a heterocy clic group which may contain a further hetero atom and R³ is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl or aralkyl in the presence of an L specific serine or thiol carboxy peptidase enzyme, in an aqueous solution or dispersion having a pH from about 7 to 10.5, to form an insulin derivative of the formulae Ins B OH, Ins B NR¹R², Ins B B NR¹R² Ins B OR³, Ins B SR³ or Ins B SeR³ wherein Ins, B, R¹, R² and R³ are as defined above and, if desired, cleaving any NR¹R², B NR¹R², OR³, SR³ or SeR³ group. The invention allows human insulin to be prepared from porcine insulin and threonine.
