# Method of and apparatus for deriving a PAL colour television signal corresponding to any desired field in an 8 field PAL sequence from one stored field or picture of a PAL signal.

## Abstract
A single field of a PAL colour television signal is stored in a store 50 and provides a signal at an input 52 . The signal is delayed by one line delays 56,58 in series to provide one and two line delayed signals. Separate switching units 60,62 select desired ones or combinations of the input and delayed signals to constitute respectively the low frequency and chrominance part of the signal at the output 82 . The switch positions are changed between fields, and for at least some fields of the PAL sequence each component of the output signal is formed by combining signals from more than one line, i.e. a halving adder 64 66 averages successive lines for the low frequency part of the signal and a halving subtractor 68 forms the difference between lines two lines apart for the chrominance part. The selector unit outputs are combined in an adder 78 which receives the output of the first selector 60 , and also the difference between the output of the two selectors after band pass filtering 76 . The store 50 can be replaced by a random access store capable of outputting three successive lines simultaneously. The apparatus has special utility in equipment for movement portrayal.
