# Overbased monoalkyl orthoxylene and monoalkyl toluene sulfonates and use as lubricant additives.

## Abstract
Overbased alkaline earth metal sulphonates obtained from monoalkyl orthoxylene or toluene, in which the alkyl groups contain from 15 to 40 carbon atoms, have been found to have reduced foaming tendency as compared with corresponding benzene based sulphonates.
