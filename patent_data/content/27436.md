# Safety device at remote control of hydraulic or pneumatic machine tools.

## Abstract
A safety device at remote control of hydraulic or pneuma tic machine tools where electric signals are used for control ling hydraulic or pneumatic valves, for example machines comprising a selector valve for different hydraulic functions, which is controlled by electrohydraulic or electropneumatic converters N , and where a control unit is capable by means of electric impulses to transfer orders via a cable to a receiver unit H , which is capable to control said converters N via signal converters L and amplifiers M for amplifying received signals. According to the invention the output of the receiver unit H is connected to a zero detector P , which is capable, after a certain predetermined time from detection that there is no output signal from the receiver H , to detect whether or not there is an output signal from the respective amplifier M or corresponding means, and when there is an output signal from the respective amplifier M , although there is no corres ponding signal on the output of the receiver unit H , to break the current supply to said amplifier M .
