# MECHANICAL DISHWASHING RINSE COMPOSITION HAVING A LOW FOAMING SULFONIC ACID RINSING AGENT AND A SOURCE OF ACTIVE HALOGEN

## Abstract
A low foaming rinse composition that can be used in spray warewashing machines to provide sanitation, bleaching, and rinsing can comprise in an aqueous base a sufficient bleaching sanitizing amount of an active halogen composition and a sulfonate rinse agent, optionally in the presence of a threshold agent. The sulfonate rinse agent is a C₁ ₉ hydrocarbyl diphenyl oxide sulfonic or sulfonate com position.
