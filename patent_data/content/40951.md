# Wrought lead calcium strontium tin barium alloy for battery components.

## Abstract
A work hardenable Pb Ca Sr Sn alloy having anti recrystallization stability at temperatures below about 66 C. The alloy comprises by weight 0.03 to 0.04 calcium 0.15 to 0.4 strontium 0.15 to 0.9 tin 0 to 0.1 barium and the balance principally lead. The alloy is useful in the manufature of cold worked Pb acid storage battery components and particularly grids made by the expanded, wrought lead strip process.
