# Semiconductor integrated circuit device with test circuit.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit which includes therein at least one inspection circuit 11 for inspecting a voltage level produced at an internal node N2 to be in spected. The inspection circuit has at least a control signal input part 11C connected to the internal node N2 to be in spected and an input part 12 connected to a particular one of the external input output pins. The inspection circuit is comprised of a series connected transistor Q6 and diode Q7 between a power source VCC and the input part 12 , a capacitor Q8 connected between a gate of the transistor and the input part, and a transfer gate transistor Q5 con nected between the control signal input part and the gate of the transistor. The inspection circuit discriminates the level at the internal node, according to a flow or nonflow of a current via the external input output pin 12 when a par ticular signal having a voltage level higher than the power source level is supplied to this pin.
