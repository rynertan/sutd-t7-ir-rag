## Abstract
A converter circuit for addition to the existing lamp operating circuitry of a high pressure mercury lamp consist ing of an existing series ballast inductor L and a power factor correcting capacitor C connected across the input terminals of the existing lamp operating circuit includes inductance L₁ arranged to be connected to the ballast inductor L to as to adjust the resultant series inductance to a value suitable for a sodium lamp SON , and an igniter portion A coupled to the converter inductance L₁ . The igni ter portion A operates to apply ignition voltage to the sodium lamp SON during at least part of the time that the converter circuit is aupplied with power. Protective circuitry B is coupled to the converter inductance L₁ to block or limit high frequency voltage pulses which could otherwise reach the ballast inductor L . The circuit can be used to con vert high pressure mercury lamp operating circuits into a circuit suitable for operating either a high pressure or a low pressure sodium lamp by appropriate choice of the converter inductance L₁ and other converter circuit components.
