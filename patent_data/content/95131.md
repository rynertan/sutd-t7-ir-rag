## Description
COATED SILICON NITRIDE CUTTING TOOLS This invention relates to composite ceramic cutting tools and cutting tool inserts. More particularly, it is concerned with densified silicon nitride cutting tools and cutting tool inserts having a refractory material coating. Cemented carbide materials are well known for their unique combination of properties of hardness, strength, and wear resistance and have accordingly found extensive use in mining tool bits, metal cutting and boring tools, metal drawing dies, wear resistant machine parts and the like. It is known that the wear resistance of cemented carbide materials may be enhanced by the application of thin coatings of a highly wear resistant material such as titanium carbide or aluminum oxide. These coated carbide materials are finding increased commercial utility for certain cutting tool and machining applications. Economic pressures for higher productivity in machin ing applications are placing increasing demands upon the performance of cutting tool materials. To achieve high productivity in machining, a tool must be able to cut at high speeds. At cutting speeds exceed 1500 surface feet per minute sfpm , the high temperature strength and chemical inertness of a cutting tool material become more and more important. The usefulness of cemented carbide cutting tool materials the predominant material used in cutting tools today has been extended to applications requiring cutting speeds of about 1500 sfpin by coating such tools with aluminum oxide.For cutting speeds in excess of 1500 sfpm, cemented carbide tools encounter problems associated with loss of strength and tool nose deformation, which affect dimensional tolerance in the workpiece and contribute to shorter tool life. Conventional ceramic cutting tools overcome many of these disadvantages but have some limitations relating to their lower impact strength and fracture toughness. This is especially true of many alumina based conventional ceramic cutting tools. Silicon nitride based ceramic cutting tools have significantly higher impact strength and fracture toughness, but can exhibit lower than desired chemical inertness when employed in cutting long chipping metals such as steel. It is therefore. an object of the present invention to provide improved cutting tools and cutting tool inserts. It is another object of this invention to provide improved cutting tool inserts useful in the machining of metals under demanding conditions of machining speed, temperature, or workpiece hardness. It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved abrasion resistant ceramic cutting tool with improved performance in cutting long chipping workpiece materials. These and other objects and advantages are.achieved in accordance with the present invention wherein there is provided a coated ceramic cutting tool or cutting tool insert comprising a densified silicon nitride substrate body having at least one hard, adherent coating layer consisting essentially of a refractory material. The substrate body consists essentially of a first phase of silicon nitride and a second refractory phase comprising silicon nitride and an effective amount of a densification additive selected from the group consisting of silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, yttrium oxide, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, the lanthanide rare earth oxides, and mixtures thereof.The coating is selected from the group consisting of alumina nitrides, carbides, and carbonitrides of titanium, vanadium, chromipm, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, hafnium, tantalum, tungsten and mixtures thereof. The substrate body of coated silicon nitride cutting tools and tool inserts in accordance with this invention possesses a microstructure consisting essentially of a first phase of silicon nitride and a refractory second phase comprising silicon nitride and a refractory second phase comprising silicon nitride and an effective amount of a densification aid selected from the group consisting of aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium oxide, zirconium oxide, the lanthanide rare earth oxides, and mixtures thereof. Because the refractory intergranular phase is essentially continuous, and because impurities and additives present in the overall composite substrate body tend to concentrate in the intergranular phase during the densifying process, the composition of the intergranular phase profoundly affects the high temperature properties of the densified composite. It is considered important to incorporate into this intergranular phase of the substrate body a densification aid which permits densification to densities approaching theoretical, and at the same time does not deleteriously affect the high temperature strength and creep resistance of the overall composite. Typical densification aids useful for this purpose are metal oxides selected from silicon dioxide aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, magnesium oxide, yttrium oxide, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, the lanthanide rare earth oxides, and mixtures thereof.Yttrium oxide and hafnium oxide are preferred. The metal oxide densification aid is employed in amounts from a lower effective amount which permits full densification to an upper amount which does not unduly affect the high temperature properties of the body.Preferably the metal oxide densification aid comprises from about 1 weight percent to about 25 weight percent of the substrate body. More preferably, the metal oxide comprises from about 1 weight percent to about 5 weight percent of the body. Silicon dioxide may be added to the initial powder mixture employed in the formation of the substrate body or alternatively, may be present as a surface oxide coating on the silicon nitride employed. During subsequent processing of the powder mixture to form the densified composite silicon nitride substrate body, the silicon dioxide and other metal oxide densification aid tend to concentrate in the refractory intergranular phase. It is preferred that the amount of silicon dioxide present in the final densified body comprise less than about 5 weight percent of the substrate body. The intergranular phase of the substrate may contain further additional materials in the form of additives or impurities in addition to the above mentioned silicon dioxide and metal oxide densification aids. Such further additional materials are preferably present in amounts less than about 5 weight percent of the host matrix. The starting silicon nitride powder employed in the preparation of the ceramic substrate bodies of tools in accordance with this invention may be partly crystallized amorphous material, a mixture of substantially amorphous and substantially crystalline material, or substantially completely crystalline material. The starting material may be processed to a powder compact of adequate green strength by thoroughly mixing with any binders or pressing aids which may be employed, for example by ball milling in a non reactive medium such as toluene or methanol, and subsequently consolidating the mixture by pressing, extruding, or slip casting. Processing may also optionally include a pre sintering or prereacting step in which either the uncompacted powder or the powder compact is heated at moderate temperatures such as from about 500cm to about 10000C in order to remove any binders and volatile solvents and to partially react the starting materials. The substrate bodies of cutting tools of this invention are made by compacting the above mentioned components to a highly dense article by conventional techniques such as sintering, hot pressing, or hot isostatic pressing. Since the strength of the resulting cutting tools decreases with increasing porosity of the compact, it is important that the compact be densified to a density as closely approaching theoretical density as possible. It has been found that mechanical mixing of the powdered components of the cutting tools of this invention results in smaller or larger inhomogeneities in the distribution of the modifying phase. These inhomogeneities may be of the order of 5 to 300 microns in size, resulting in undesired localized variation in properties of the matrix. Homogeneity of the cutting tool material is an extremely important factor for tool performance. During cutting, only a small portion of the cutting tool is exposed to high stress and elevated temperatures. The temperature induced changes in mechanical properties, which are also compositionally dependent, contribute to fracture and chipping at the tool edge, in turn contributing to the rate of tool wear. The powder blends employed as starting mixtures for tool substrates of this invention are densified to a density of at least 988 of theoretical by pressing followed by sintering, hot pressing, gas over pressure sintering, or hot isostatic pressing in a non oxidizing atmosphere. Temperatures employed for pressing followed by sintering range from about 16000C to about 1800 C, preferably from about 1700 C to about 1800or. Hot pressing is carried out at pressures greater than about 2000 psig 13,790 kN M2 at temperatures ranging from about 16000C to about 1900 C, preferably from about 17000C to about 1900 C. Gas over pressure sintering is carried out at pressures from about 150 to about 200 psig about 1030 to about 1380 kNIM2 and at temperatures ranging from about 16000C to about 1950 C, preferably from about 17000C to about 1950 C. Hot isostatic pressing is carried out at pressures ranging above 10,000 psig 68,947 kNIM2 and at temperatures ranging from 16000C to about 1900 C, preferably from about 17000C to about 1800 C. Sintering is carried out without pressure at temperatures ranging between about 14000C and about 17000C for at least one hour, and preferably at temperatures between about 16000C and 16000C for about 1.5 to about 5 hours.Sintering is preferably carried out in a non reactive atmosphere to prevent formation of undesirable oxide or oxynitride phases. The following examples are provided to enable one skilled in the art to practice the present invention and should not be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Typical Preparation of the Substrate Body A 68 gram batch of silicon nitride powder containing 5 weight percent magnesium oxide sintering additive was mixed with 159.8 grams of toluene, 5.44 grams of methanol and 2.04 grams of magnesium steare e. The batch was thoroughly mixed by milling in a two quart polyethylene jar with about 2000 grams of milling medium for 1 2 hour.The resulting slurry was dried at about 1050C and the dry batch was dry ball milled in a polyethylene jar for 24 hours. To this dry ball milled batch were added 2.04 grams of Carbowax, 68 grams of toluene, and 2.04 grams of methanol. The resulting mixture was milled for fifteen minutes and the resulting slurry was dried at about 105 C. The dried powder mixture was screened through a 60 mesh screen and the 60 mesh fraction was pressed at about 25,000 psig to obtain a green powder compact. The magnesium stearate and Carbowax binders were removed by heating the green compact at a rate of about 500C per hour to a temperature of about 6000C and maintaining the final temperature for about 4 hours in air. The compact was sintered at 17000C for about 5 hours to produce a densified silicon nitride body having substantially full density. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the substrate body is coated with at least one hard, adherent coating layer comprising a refractory material. Typical refractory materials include alumina, the nitrides, carbides and carbonitrides of titanium, vanadium, chromium, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, hafnium, tantalum, and tungsten. Preferred coatings in accordance with this invention are alumina, titanium carbide, titanium carbonitride, titanium nitride and hafnium carbide, hafnium carbonitride and hafnium nitride.The coating layer is of a thickness ranging between about 0.1 microns to about 20 microns, preferably between about 1.0 and about 10 microns. Coating Methods The composite substrate body produced by the methods detailed are coated with a refractory material by chemical vapor deposition techniques or physical vapor deposition techniques. For example, the preferred coatings of alumina, titanium carbide, titanium carbonitride, titanium nitride or hafnium carbide, hafnium carbonitride or hafnium nitride are applied by chemical vapor deposition.Other refractory materials are applied by chemical vapor deposition techniques where such techniques are applicable, or by physical vapor deposition techniques such as direct evaporation, sputtering, etc.Alternatively, the refractory material itself may be deposited by chemical or physical deposition techniques and subsequently nitrided to produce a refractory metal nitride coating. Useful characteristics of the chemical vapor deposition method are the purity of the deposited layer and the tendency for some diffusional interaction between the layer being deposited and the substrate during early stages of the deposition process which leads to good layer adherency. As an example, titanium nitride layers are formed on the composite silicon nitride substrates of cutting tools of this invention by passing a gaseous mixture of titanium tetrachloride, a gaseous nitrogen source such as nitrogen or ammonia, and hydrogen over the substrate at a temperature of between about 8000C and 1500 C, preferably at temperatures above about 1000 C. The reaction is described by the following equation hydrogen is added to insure that the reaction takes place in a reducing environment 2 TiC14 N2 4 H2 2 TiN 8 HCl The mixture is passed over the heated substrate until the desired coating thickness is achieved.Routine experimentation is used to determine the rate of coating thickness growth at a particular gaseous flow rate and temperature. As another example, titanium carbide layers are formed on the silicon nitride substrate bodies of cutting tools of this invention by passing a gaseous mixture of titanium tetrachloride, a gaseous carbon source such as methane, and hydrogen over the substrate at a temperature of between about 8000C and 1500 C, preferably at temperatures above about 1000 C. The reaction is described by the following equation, although hydrogen is often added to insure that the reaction takes place in a reducing environment TIC14 CH4 TiC 4 HC1 The mixture is passed over the heated substrate until the desired coating thickness is achieved. Routine experimentation is used to determine the rate of coating thickness growth at a particular gaseous flow rate and temperature. As another example, titanium carbonitride layers are formed on the composite silicon nitride substrates of cutting tools of this invention in the chemical vapor deposition technique by passing a gaseous mixture of titanium tetrachloride, a gaseous carbon source such as methane, a gaseous nitrogen source such as nitrogen or ammonia, and hydrogen over the substrate at a temperature of between about 8000C and 1500 C, preferably at temperatures above about 1200 C. Dissociated ammonia may be substituted for a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen gases.The reaction is described by the following equation, although hydrogen is often added to insure that the reaction takes place in a reducing environment TiC14 CH4 N2 Ti C N y xy The mixture is passed over the heated substrate until the desired coating thickness is achieved. Routine experimentation is used to determine the rate of coating thickness growth at a particular gaseous flow rate and temperature. Control of the amounts of methane and nitrogen in the gas mixture permit the formation of layers in which the ratio of x to y in the formula Ti C N are varied. The xy preferred values of x and y range between about 0.5 to about 0.6 for x and from about 0.4 to about 0.5 zor y resulting in a preferred range of x y ratio of from about 1.0 to about 1.5. The most preferred ratio of x to y is about 1.22, corresponding to values for x and y of about 0.55 and about 0.45, respectively. As another example, the substrate bodies produced by the methods detailed above are coated with aluminum oxide by chemical vapor deposition techniques or physical vapor deposition techniques known in the art. In one chemical vapor deposition technique, more fully described in U.S.Pat. No. 3,sol4,473, vaporized aluminum chloride or other halide of aluminum is passed over the heated substrate together with water vapor and hydrogen gas. Alternatively, the aluminum oxide is deposited by physical vapor deposition techniques such as direct evaporation or sputtering. The reaction for the chemical vapor deposition technique is described by the following equation, although hydrogen gas is often added to insure that the reaction takes place. in a reducing atmosphere 2 A1C13 3 H20 AlA12 3 6 HC1 The substrate piece or pieces are heated to a temperature between about 8000C to about 15000C and the gaseous mixture is passed over the heated substrate until the desired coating thickness is achieved.Routine experimentation is used to determine the rate of coating thickness growth at a particular gaseous flow rate and temperature. In another, preferred method of coating the nitride substrate bodies with one or more adherent alumina coating layers, aluminum chloride is reacted with carbon dioxide in the presence of hydrogen gas according to the following equation 2 Aid3 3 CO2 3 H2 Awl 203 3 CO 6 HCl carbon monoxide is optionally added to the gas mixture passed over the heated substrate bodies in order to establish the desired equilibrium gas composition. While there have been shown and described what are at present believed to be the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
