# Digital concentrator.

## Abstract
A digital concentrator system for use with a plurality of digital transmission systems is disclosed. The concentrator is employed at a central office terminal 100 , and at a remote terminal 102 , with an interconnecting digital transmission path 108 . In the transmit direction at each terminal 110, 112 , a plurality of multiplexed encoded signal streams are demultiplexed and the encoded signals stored. A selected number of encoded signals are retrieved and multiplexed for transmission to a distant terminal 112, 110 as a concen trated pulse stream 123, 175 . In the receive direction at each terminal 110, 112 , the encoded signals in the multiplexed concentrated stream 125, 177 are demultiplexed and stored. The stored encoded signals are retrieved and the original number of encoded signal streams derived for transmission to the transmission terminal 100, 102 . Super visory and control communication between the two concen trator terminals 110, 112 is achieved by way of data messages on a derived data link. Operation between the transmit and receive directions at each terminal is asynchro nous and controlled by a microcomputer 124, 160 .
