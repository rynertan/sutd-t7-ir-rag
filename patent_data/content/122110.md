# FLAME RETARDANT ELECTRICAL CABLE

## Abstract
Disclosed is a flame retardant electrical cable 20, 22, 24 able to meet or exceed the flame spread requirements of Underwriters Laboratories Tunnel Flame Test UL 910 while minimizing or eliminating halogen, particularly fluorine content from the cable by utilizing a first non fluorocarbon polymer and compositions based thereupon for use in making one of the conductor insulation 4 or the protective jacket 6 of the cable and a second non fluorocarbon polymer or fluorocarbon poly mer which may be the same as or different from the first poly mer and compositions based thereupon for use in making the other of the conductor insulation or the jacket of the cable where the first and second polymers and compositions based thereupon have a composite Steiner Index of
