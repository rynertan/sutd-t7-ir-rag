## Description
The present invention relates generally to combine harvesters and, more particularly, to improvements in the cleaning apparatus of such harvesters to permit a leveling thereof under sidehill conditions. The operation of a combine harvester under sidehill conditions is less efficient than the operation of a combine operating on generally level ground because of the gravity induced movement of threshed grain to the downhill side of the cleaning apparatus. This unbalanced loading of the cleaning mechanism prevents a proper flow of air from a cleaning fan through the threshed grain on the cleaning sieves to facilitate the removal of chaff and other debris. This unbalanced lateral distribution of material across the cleaning mechanism reduces or eliminates the aerodynamic separation and cleaning of the threshed grain by the flow of air through the sieves at least in sections of the cleaning sieves. As a result, the cleaning mechanism delivers a greater amount of uncleaned grain to the returns system for reprocessing and also discharges uncleaned grain at the rear of the combine which thus is lost from the harvesting process. One known method of eliminating this problem is to reduce crop intake however, operating efficiency of the combine is correspondingly reduced which is not desirable. One attempt to maintain a combine cleaning apparatus in a horizontal orientation while the combine is operating under sidehill conditions is found in U.S. Patent No. 3,731,470. With this particular apparatus, the entire frame of the combine is leveled through the operation of hydraulic cylinders, requiring a modified connection of the crop harvesting header to the combine to permit a proper gathering of the crop material to be harvested. Another cleaning apparatus leveling mechanism can be seen in U.S. Patent No. 4,344,443, which provides that the entire cleaning mechanism, including the fan, is pivotally mounted for movement relative to the main frame about a longitudinally extending pivotal axis. However, this particular mechanism is expensive to manufacture, is cumbersome in operation, results in an unnecessary shifting of major structural components and requires a more complex main frame structure and drive train components. Still another leveling mechanism is shown in US patent no. 2.691.444 which discloses means to maintain only the chaffer sieve in a transverse level attitude during operation of the combine harvester under sidehill conditions. However, gravity induced movement of threshed grain to the downhill side of the cleaning apparatus on conventional combine harvestors operating under sidehill conditions not only occurs on the chaffer sieve but equally occurs on the grain pan disposed in the threshed grain receiving relationship with the threshing and separating mechanism forwardly of the chaffer sieve. It is the object of the present invention to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages of the prior art and, more particularly, to provide a lateral leveling mechanism for the cleaning apparatus in a combine harvester which, at the same time, is efficient in operation on the one hand and yet is simple in design with only a minimum number of parts differing from the corresponding parts in a conventional combine and therefore relatively inexpensive to manufacture, on the other hand. According to the invention a combine harvester is provided having a mobile main frame and a cleaning mechanism supported thereby in flow communication with a threshing and separating mechanism to receive threshed grain therefrom and clean debris from said threshed grain the cleaning mechanism comprising sieve means operable to permit the passage of cleaned grain therethrough and operably supported on the main frame for generally fore and aft reciprocating movement on the one hand and for lateral, generally pivotal movement about a generally fore and aft extending axis relative to the main frame on the other hand actuator means operably associated with the sieve means for selectively controlling the generally pivotal movement thereof to permit said sieve means to be maintained in a transversely level attitude irrespective of the transverse attitude of the main frame drive means for effecting the generally fore and aft reciprocating movement of the sieve means to convey threshed grain therealong while permitting cleaned grain to pass therethrough and fan means operable to blow air through the sieve means to facilitate the removal of debris from the threshed grain. The invention is characterized in that the cleaning mechanism further also comprises a subframe mounting the sieve means and being supported on the main frame for said lateral, generally pivotal movement about said generally fore and aft extending axis relative to the main frame, the actuator means controlling said lateral, generally pivotal movement of the subframe in unison with the sieve means mounted thereon and grain pan means for receiving threshed grain from the threshing and separating mechanism and being supported on the subframe for movement therewith and in unison with the sieve means about said axis such that the grain pan means together with the sieve means can be tilted in said transverse direction relative to the main frame for maintaining said transverse level attitude irrespective of the transverse attitude of the main frame without effecting movement of the fan means relative to said main frame the drive means being operable to reciprocate the grain pan means in said generally fore and aft direction to convey threshed grain received thereon to the sieve means. Preferably the grain pan and chaffer sieve are mounted in a subframe which itself is pivotally supported by a shaker shoe for a laterally tilting movement about a fore and aft extending axis. The shaker shoe, in turn, is operably mounted on the main frame and connected to an eccentric drive to effect a generally fore and aft shaking action to convey threshed grain on the grain pan and the chaffer sieve in a rearward direction. The pivotal movement of the subframe relative to the shaker shoe is accomplished through the use of a hydraulic cylinder interconnecting the shaker shoe and the subframe to permit a lateral leveling of the grain pan and chaffer sieve when the combine is operated under sidehill conditions. An inclinometer is utilized to automatically control the flow of hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic cylinder to permit the subframe to be leveled in response to a sensing of a non horizontal transverse inclination by the inclinometer. Accordingly, the instant invention provides a mechanism for leveling the cleaning apparatus in a combine harvester that only levels the grain pan and the chaffer sieve. The fan and supporting structural components are not pivotally supported for lateral tilting movement. A lower sieve can be suspended from the main frame below the chaffer sieve without the pivotal movement of the subframe supporting the chaffer sieve effecting the movement of said lower sieve. This lower sieve can be operatively connected to the shaker shoe to effect a fore and aft reciprocating movement in opposition to the shaker shoe and yet to avoid any interference with the transverse leveling action of the grain pan and the chaffer sieve. It is an advantage of this invention that the efficiency of operation of the combine cleaning mechanism is increased under sidehill operating conditions. Also the grain losses and return flows are diminished. Yet the invention also provides a leveling mechanism for a combine cleaning apparatus without requiring complex main frame structure and drive train components. Furthermore, the weight of the structural elements pivotally supported for movement about a longitudinally extending axis is reduced, permitting an improved leveling operation. In general, the instant invention provides a lateral leveling mechanism for the cleaning apparatus of a combine harvester which is durable in construction, inexpensive of manufacture, carefree of maintenance, facile in assemblage, and simple and effective in use. The advantages of this invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of the invention, especially when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a side elevational view of a combine harvester incorporating the principles of the instant invention, portions of the side structure of the harvester being broken away to better show the invention Fig. 2 is an enlarged partial cross sectional view of the cleaning apparatus seen in Fig. 1, the generally fore and aft reciprocating movement of the shaker shoe and lower sieve being shown in phantom Fig. 3 is a partial cross sectional end view of the cleaning apparatus shown in Fig. 2 seen in the direction indicated by lines 3 3, the pivotal movement of the subframe containing the grain pan and chaffer sieve being shown in phantom, the hydraulic and electrical diagrams for controlling the operation of the hydraulic cylinder tilting the subframe being schematically shown beneath the cleaning apparatus and Figs 4 6 are schematic views depicting the operation of the lateral leveling mechanism for the combine cleaning apparatus. Referring now to the drawings and, particularly, to Fig. 1, a side elevational view of a combine harvester incorporating the principles of the instant invention, can be seen. Any left and right references are used as a matter of convenience and are determined with reference to the direction of operative forward travel. The combine 10 is provided with a main frame 12 having at least one transversely disposed beam 13 mobilely supported over the ground G by wheels 14. A crop harvesting header 15 is forwardly supported from the frame 12 to gather crop material and convey it rearwardly via a feeding mechanism 17 to a threshing and separating mechanism 19. The threshing and separating mechanism 19 is operable to thresh the crop material fed thereto and separate the threshed grain from the trash material by precipitating the threshed grain downwardly through the threshing and separating mechanism 19 while discharging the trash material along a separate path to be deposited on the ground G rearwardly of the combine 10. A cleaning mechanism 20 is positioned beneath the threshing and separating mechanism 19 to receive the threshed grain precipitated therefrom on a grain pan 22. Generally, the cleaning mechanism 20 is operatively connected to an eccentric drive 24 to affect a generally fore and aft reciprocating movement of the cleaning mechanism 20 to convey the threshed grain in a rearward direction. Sieve means 25 are positioned rearwardly of the grain pan 22 to receive threshed grain conveyed rearwardly therefrom and clean the threshed grain from chaff and other debris conveyed therewith. Typically, the sieve means 25 include an upper chaffer sieve 26 and a lower cleaning sieve 28 mounted for opposing fore and aft reciprocating movement and in flow communication with air being blown from a fan 29 upwardly therethrough to remove chaff and debris from the threshed grain. Cleaned grain passing through the sieve means 25 is conveyed into a storage tank 18 supported on the main frame 12. Referring now to Figs. 2 and 3, the details of the leveling mechanism comprising the instant invention can best be seen. The grain pan 22 and chaffer sieve 26 are mounted in a subframe 31 which in turn is pivotally supported by fore and aft extending and longitudinally spaced pivots 33,34 within a shaker shoe 35. A tailings return section 27 is positioned at the rear of the chaffer sieve 26 and is pivotally movable therewith. The tailings return section 27 is cooperable with conventional appratus for returning unthreshed heads to the threshing and separating means 19. The shaker shoe 35 is pivotally supported from the frame 12 by connecting links 36,37 incorporating rubber bushings in a conventional manner to permit a generally fore and aft reciprocating movement induced by drive arms 38 interconnecting the shaker shoe 35 and the eccentric drive 24. The lower cleaning sieve 28 is supported from the frame 12 by connecting links 37,39 in a similar manner to permit a generally fore and aft reciprocating movement. By utilizing the connecting links 37 with frame mounting points intermediate the connection between the shaker shoe 35 and the lower cleaner sieve 28, the shaker shoe 35 and lower sieve 28 are drivingly reciprocating in opposing fore and aft directions in a manner conventionally known by one skilled in the art. The shaker shoe 35 is provided with inwardly directed arcuate side members 41 to permit a sealing cooperation with longitudinally extending seals 43 connected to the subframe 31 and sweepingly engaging the inside of said arcuate side members 41. Although the shaker shoe 35 is not laterally pivotable relative to the main frame 12, the shaker shoe 35 does reciprocate in the aforementioned fore and aft direction relative to said main frame 12. Seals 44 connected to the shaker shoe 35 engage the side sheets 46 of the combine 10 to prevent the loss of threshed grain between the shaker shoe 35 and side sheets 46. The subframe 31 is provided with a downwardly extending actuating arm 48. A hydraulic cylinder 50 interconnects a mounting tab 52 connected to the shaker shoe 35 and the actuating arm 48 for the pivotal movement of the subframe 31 about the fore and aft extending pivot axis 55 defined by the front and back pivots 33,34. An adjustable stop bolt 49 engageable with the shaker shoe 35 serves as a limit to the amount of pivotal movement permitted to the subframe 32 in one direction, while that the end of the retraction stroke of the cylinder 50 limits the movement of the subframe 31 in the opposing direction. The hydraulic cylinder 50 is operatively associated with a hydraulic system 60 providing a flow of hydraulic fluid under pressure for operation thereof. The hydraulic system 60 includes a solenoid valve 62 controlling the direction of hydraulic fluid flow to the cylinder 50. The solenoid valve 62 can be positioned to direct fluid to the cylinder 50 for either extension or retraction thereof or to circulate fluid back to the reservoir 63 without affecting any movement of the hydraulic cylinder 50. The positioning of the solenoid valve 62 is controlled through an electrical circuit 65 connected to an inclinometer 70. The inclinometer 70 includes a master member 72 having first and second space apart electrical contacts 73,74, respectively, and a pendulum 75 pivotally mounted within the master member 72 for movement with the force of gravity relative to the master member 72. The pendulum 75 carries a third electrical contact 76 engageable with respectively the first and second contacts 73,74 to close the electrical circuit 65 and send a flow of electrical current from a primary source, such as a battery 68, to the solenoid valve 62. The position of the master member 72 relative to the transverse beam 13 is controlled through a link 79 interconnecting the actuating arm 48 and the master member 72. A lateral tilting of the subframe 31 relative to the shaker shoe 35 affects a corresponding movement of the master member 72 relative to the transverse beam 13 and the pendulum 75. One skilled in the art will readily realize that other means for sensing the transverse inclination of the main frame 12 in place of the inclinometer 70 described above could be provided to equally control the operation of the solenoid valve 62, such as the utilization of mercury switches or hall effect switches. Another modification to the inclinometer 70, described above, would be to dampen the movement of the pendulum 75 in an oil bath. Referring to the schematic view seen in Figs. 4 6, and the structural components best referenced in Fig. 3, the operation of the lateral leveling mechanism can best be seen. In Fig. 4, the combine 10 is shown operating on level ground G with the subframe 31 of the cleaning mechanism 20 in a horizontal orientation and the pendulum 75 positioned with the third contact 76 spaced intermediate of the first and second contacts 73,74. A shifting of the transverse orientation of the combine 10 onto a sidehill operation depicted by an inclination of the ground G in Fig. 5 at an angle A relative to horizontal with the left wheel being lower than the right wheel, causes a relative movement between the pendulum 75 and the master member 72. Since the movement of the pendulum 75 is influenced by the force of gravity, the movement of the master member 72 with the transverse beam 13 causes the second and third contacts 74,76 to engage. The subsequent flow of electrical current from the battery 68 through the electrical circuit 65 causes a shifting of the solenoid valve 62 to direct hydraulic fluid through the hydraulic cylinder 50 to affect an extension of the cylinder 50, the result being a pivotal movement of the subframe 31 about the pivot axis 55. The corresponding movement of the actuating arm 48 pushes the master member 72 until the second and third contacts 74,76 break engagement and, therefore, break the electrical circuit 65, permitting the solenoid valve 62 to shift back into a neutral position causing a circulating of hydraulic fluid without affecting further movement of the hydraulic cylinder 50. As represented in Fig. 6, the result is that the cleaning mechanism 20 is positioned in a horizontal orientation while that the transverse beam 13 is inclined at angle A in a sidehill operation. A return of the combine 10 to level ground G or the positioning of the combine 10 in a transverse inclination with the right wheel being lower than the left wheel, is similar to the operation described relative to Figs. 4 6 above. The relative movement between the pendulum 75 and the master member 72 effects an engagement between the first and third contacts 73,76 causing a shifting of the solenoid valve 62 to affect a flow of hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic cylinder 50 to cause a retraction thereof and pivot the subframe 31 about the pivot axis 55 until the master member 72 is moved sufficiently relative to the pendulum 75 to break the engagement between the first contact 73 and the third contact 76. Having described so far the preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be understood that changes are possible without departure from the spirit of the invention. In the preferred embodiment described above and shown in the drawings, the grain pan 22 and the chaffer sieve 26 are supported on the subframe 31 which is pivotally mounted around the fore and aft extending axis 55 on the shaker shoe 35 which itself, in turn, is mounted on the main frame 12 for permitting a reciprocating movement thereof in the generally fore and aft direction. It will be understood that the subframe and the shaker shoe may change places. Indeed, in an alternative arrangement of the invention, the grain pan 22 and the chaffer sieve 26 may be supported on a shaker shoe which itself is mounted for generally fore and aft reciprocating movement on a subframe. The subframe, in turn may be mounted for pivotal movement about a generally fore and aft extending axis on the main frame. Obviously, in this alternative arrangement of the invention, the drive means should be adapted to reciprocate the shaker shoe relative to the subframe rather than relative to the main frame as is the case in the preferred embodiment. Also, the hydraulic cylinder for controlling the transverse pivotal movement of the subframe should interconnect said subframe and the main frame rather than the subframe and the shaker shoe as is the case in the preferred embodiment. In the alternative embodiment under consideration, arcuate sidewalls should be provided on the main frame to accomodate the pivotal movement of the subframe. Fore and aft extending seals mounted on the subframe are engageable with these arcuate main frame sidewalls to prevent the loss of threshed grain between the main frame and the subframe during pivoting movement of the subframe relative to the main frame. Similarly, the shaker shoe is provided with longitudinally extending seals which preferably are engageable with sidewalls of the subframe to prevent the loss of threshed grain between the shaker shoe and the subframe sidewalls during the reciprocating movement of the shaker shoe relative to the subframe. Like in the preferred embodiment, a lower cleaning sieve is suspended from the main frame below the chaffer sieve, the drive means being operable to reciprocate said lower sieve in opposition to the shaker shoe thereabove. Pivotal movement of the subframe also remains without effect on the movement of the lower sieve in the alternative embodiment of the invention. While that the preferred structure as well as a variation thereof in which the principles of the present invention have been incorporated, are shown and described above, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the particular details thus presented, but, in fact, widely different means may be employed in the practice of the broader aspects of this invention. The scope of the appended claims is intended to encompass obvious changes in the details, materials and the arrangement of parts which will occur to one of skill in the art upon a reading of this disclosure.
