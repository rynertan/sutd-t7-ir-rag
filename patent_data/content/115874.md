# Optical filter device.

## Abstract
The device includes a filter member 30 which is located to intersect an optical path along which optical energy having a high density propagates. The filter member 30 is constantly rotated to sequentially shift a part thereof on which the optical energy is incident, The axis of rotation 32 of the filter member 30 is movable perpendicularly thereto within a predetermined range. The filter member transmits a light component having a particular wavelength and reflectors at least one of the light components in the other wavelength range.
