## Abstract
A recording electrode 11 and an opposed electrode 5 are so positioned as to confront each other through a recording medium 6 , and a recoding signal Vb is applied to the record ing electrode 11 while a signal reverse biased Vc with re spect to the recording signal is applied to the opposed elec trode 57, so that the potential difference between the record ing electrode and the opposed electrode is increased in a state where the respective voltages applied to the mutually con fronting electrodes are maintained at low values, thereby sput tering ink from the fore end 10 of the recording electrode 11 in a satisfactory manner without the necessity of any particular process for insulation of the individual components.
