# Right ventricular assist device.

## Abstract
A right ventricular assist device for assisting the circula tion of the blood includes a smooth segmented polyurethane sac 13 having a single valveless passageway 19 to provide a single inlet and outlet. A rigid ellipsoidal shell 11 surrounds the sac 13 and has a first opening 19 for the single valveless passageway and a second opening 23 for pressurizing an interior portion of the shell 11 . The shell 11 has X, Y and R axes, wherein X and Y define an ellipse, and R defines a radius rotated to form the ellipsoid. A flexible diaphragm 17 extends across the interior of the shell 11 and divides the interior into two volumes the sac 13 and first opening 19 in a first volume, and the second opening 23 and a pressurizing chamber in a second volume.
