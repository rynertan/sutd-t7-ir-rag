# A piston for ejecting a viscous or plastic mass.

## Abstract
An ejection piston for use in cylindrical containers or packages 10 of the type containing viscous or plastic masses, such as sealing compounds and adhesives. The piston comprises a piston part 13 forming a skirt 15 as well as an arched piston top 14 , and a separate piston actuating member 17 arched in a direction opposite to the piston top. An ejection pressure is applied to the actuating member 17 and transmitted to the piston top 14 whereby the effective diameter of the piston top is slightly increased. An annular sealing sleeve for receiving the piston skirt 15 and the adjacent free end of the cylindrical container 10 during storage may be formed integrally with the piston actuating member 17 .
