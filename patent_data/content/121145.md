# System for detecting the position of a read write head on a disk recording medium having data and servo sectors.

## Abstract
In order to perform a high speed seek of a target track while the increase of area of servo sectors is minimized, each servo sector 1 of a disk recording medium has K an integer of 3 or more servo patterns. The K servo patterns consist of a first servo pattern 7 consisting of two phase first and second pairs of alternate pattern arrays having a period of four tracks a second servo pattern 8 consisting of a pair of alternate pattern arrays having a period of 2
