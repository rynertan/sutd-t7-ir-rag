# Quiet by pass vacuum motor.

## Abstract
A by pass vacuum motor assembly wherein the motor cooling fan is positioned in an opening at the bottom of the motor band and immediately above a flat plate portion of the fan housing bracket. The flat plate portion functions as a plate diffuser, redirecting air drawn through the commutator end bracket and across the motor internals into a radial exhaust between a bottom portion of the band and a top portion of the fan end bracket. The invention also includes a brush holder clip passing through a vertical opening in the commutator end bracket and engaging a collar on the brush mechanism. The brush mechanism passes through a hori zontal opening in the commutator end bracket which in tersects with the vertical opening. Armature grounding is achieved by a disk maintained in a recess in the commutator end bracket and urged by a spring against the bearing receiving the motor shaft. The power wires to the motor are secured by a tab maintained opposite an opening in the commutator end bracket which is itself opposite an opening in the band. Power wires pass through the openings and over the tab, being crimped thereby.
