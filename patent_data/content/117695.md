# External ventricular drainage assembly.

## Abstract
An external ventricular drainage assembly 10 includes a ventricular drainage catheter 14 which can be placed in the ventricles of a patient s brain and which is connected to a su ture tab 15 for securing the catheter to the patient and for pre venting relative movement between the catheter and patient. A valve 22 is connected to the catheter for selectively opening and closing the external ventricular drainage assembly to fluid flow. An adapter 30 is connected to the valve for pro viding access to the fluid flow path within the assembly. A one way valve 34 is connected to the adapter. A first length of flexible tubing 36 is connected to the one way valve and is joined through a connector 40 to a second length of flexible tubing 42 . A collection reservoir 46 is connected to the second length of flexible tubing and includes an entry 50 and outlet port 52 . A drip chamber 48 is positioned between the second length of flexible tubing and the collection reservoir.
