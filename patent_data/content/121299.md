## Description
MOLDED NONWOVEN SHAPED ARTICLESBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to molded or shaped porous nonwoven fabric articles which are particularly well suited for use as breath filtering industrial and medical face masks. It has noteworthy value in other shaped porous nonwoven articles as diverse as seedling planting containers and filter holding shells. The desirability of shaping or molding nonwoven webs to a dimensionally predictable and suitably stable form is well known in the art. Thus, see U.S. Patent Nos.2,609,539, 3,064,329, 3,333,585, and 4,195,112 and CanadianPatent 728,462. These patents illustrate the interest and concern that has existed for many years as well as the methods of shaping fibrous structures by using heat and pressure. Shaped nonwoven products formed from either bonded fabrics or unbonded webs have achieved wide usage in commerce. They provide the desired form and suitable performance for their intended applications at relatively low cost. IJ.S. Patent 2,609,539 involves the steps of shaping the web material on the surface of a mold, heating the material to a bonding temperature, cooling the material and then removing the shaped article from the mold. U.S.Patent 3,064,329 is directed to a process in which the shaped and bonded article was promptly removed from the mold without a cooling step but it was necessary to coat and further interbond the fibers with a latex binder to provide a useful article of commerce. U.S. Patent 3,333,585 discloses a molded cold weather mask made following the general procedures of U.S. Patent 3,064,329, the mask being impregnated after molding with an aqueous dispersion of a hypo allergenic rubbery acrylic polymer textile sizing latex to coat the fibers and interbond them at their crossing points. U.S.Patent 4,195,112 describes a process for molding a coherent, pliable, thermally bonded nonwoven fabric and involves the steps of shaping and pressing the bonded fabric on a mold, heating to develop new or stronger thermal bonds, cooling the fabric to retain its shape and then removing the shaped fabric from the mold. Canadian Patent 728,462 is directed to a filter type face mask in which the fibers of the filter membrane are coated and unified after molding with a rubbery water insoluble fiber binding sizing agent.Summary of the Invention The present invention provides useful articles of commerce particularly suitable for breath filtering industrial and medical face masks by the shaping and pressing of unbonded fibrous webs on a heated mold with prompt removal of the shaped article from the heated mold and without subsequent coating and interbonding of the fibers with a binding polymeric resin. Breath filtering face masks must have the properties of low resistance to breathing, of being comfortable to the skin of the face, of being free of unbonded fibers, of having adequate filtration properties, and of being stiff enough to resist the effects of moisture and inhalation resistance. The stiffness of shaped fabric articles such as face masks is measured in terms of the force pounds required to push a 1 inch diameter flatrfaced probe 1.25 inch into the shaped article with motion from the outside of the article and perpendicular to the base of the article. The equipment used is a King Fabric StiffnessTester Model GFC1OA with digital Chatillon force gauge, modified by the addition of a suitable platform to provide repeatable spatial location of the base of the shaped article. Downstroke speed is critical to test repeatability. Flow controllers and pressure regulators are set so that the Chatillon probe crosses a 2.0 inch gap in the center of its stroke in a time of 1.13 seconds to 1.14 seconds. The pressure drop of the face mask is measured in millimeters of water pressure by passing 32 Ipm of air through the mask. The pressure drop is measured either with a Dwyer Model M 171 0 6 mm water Manometer or aDwyer Model 424 0 130 mm water Manometer. Suitable chucks are used to hold the mask tightly about the periphery so that an airtight seal is accomplished. Molded nonwoven masks with pressure drops up to 15mm meet user expectations for ease of breathing, but lower pressure drops are desirable. For example, commercial face masks made according to U.S. Patent 3,064,329 have a minimum stiffness of 0.55 pounds, a maximum pressure drop of 2.3 mm. of water and meet the other criteria of an acceptable face mask.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a side elevation showing a cuppedshaped mask as worn upon a face and Figure 2 is a frontal view of the mask of Figure 1.Detailed Description of the Invention Referring now more particularly to the drawings, it will be seen that the cuppedlshaped mask 10 when worn on the face makes a snug low pressure marginal contact between fabric and skin and conforms to the face so as to extend over the bridge of the nose, under the eyes, over the cheeks and under the chin. The margin of the mask is flared to meet the face at a comfortable acute angle which provides a sealing relationship. The mask is held in place by a light elastic head band 11. The cupped shaped body 12 of the mask comprises a thin porous fabric which is sufficiently stiff but flexible and springy so as to be comfortable and yet retain its shape and avoid collapse during inhalation.The body may be provided with several horizontal corrugations or ribs 13 across the front to further stiffen and increase resistance to collapse. A thin pliable strip 14 of aluminum is provided at the top edge of the mask to further assist in conforming the mask to the nose of the wearer by pinching the strip 14 to the contour of the nose bridge. As shown by the dashed line facial profile, the mask stands out from the face and does not touch the tip of the nose, the mouth or the chin and it permits adequate jaw movement for comfortable speaking and breathing. The following steps are employed in fabricating the porous shaped fabric articles of this invention such as face masks. 1. A dry fluffy fibrous web or batt is formed from one or a mixture of fibers by carding or by a standard air layering process such as with a wRando Webber machine sold by Rando Machine Corporation, Macedon, New York. When one type of fiber is used, the fibers are precoated and where a mixture of fibers is used, at least one type of those fibers is precoated, the coating having a significantly lower softening temperature than its concomitant base fiber. The resulting coherent but unbonded web or batt is a collection of fibers interlaced into a loose fluffy web wherein the fibers cross over and under each other so as to be held together in three dimensions by mechanical and frictional forces. 2. A dry fluffy sheet of suitable size is cut from the aforesaid air laid nonwoven web and is fitted over a heated male mold having the desired contour. A male mold of rigid silicone heated by conductive electric heating is preferred. The surface temperature of the male mold is sufficient to soften the coating of the coated fibers. The fluffy sheet is rapidly conformed as by hand smoothing to an unwrinkled approximate fit, the fibers being able to shift about to make this possible without wrinkling or impairing the uniformity of the web and without stretching the fibers. 3. A heated, Teflon coated female mold of cast aluminum and of complementary contour to the male mold is promptly brought against the web covered male mold so that a relatively uniform soft pressing action is exerted on the intervening web. The surface temperature of the female mold is sufficient to soften the coating of the coated fibers. This results in a final and precise molding of the web to the shape of the mold, the fibers still being able to move in the initial phase of this step and the web is simultaneously compacted by the soft pressing action. The coating of the coated fibers becomes heated sufficiently by the hot molds to soften and wet the surfaces of compatible fibers at their mutual crossover points. A compatible fiber is one where the contact angle with the softened coating is low enough that surface wetting occurs.The heating and pressing are insufficient to cause mashing or cutting of fibers, and fiber identity is retained. 4. The pressure forcing the molds together is released and the molds are separated. The exposed molded article is grasped about its periphery and lifted from the hot male mold, no intervening cooling being required. The article does not stick to the hot mold and can be easily and bodily lifted away without being distorted. Upon cooling, the resulting article is sufficiently stiff to function as a face mask without the addition of a separate binder system. It will be apparent that a plurality of molds can be combined into a single production unit to produce porous shaped non woven articles of the present invention on a mass production basis. The following examples will more fully illustrate the invention. While the examples are specifically directed to shaped non woven face masks, it will be apparent that numerous other shaped articles can be produced by following the teachings of the examples. Example 1 A dry fluffy fibrous web was formed on a RandoWebber utilizing 4 dpf x 51 mm all polyester sheathed fibers at a basis weight of 100 pounds per ream 320 yd2 The fiber is believed to comprise a core of polyethyleneterephthalate and a sheath of polyester resin comprising a random copolyester composite of 68 terephthalic acid units and 32 isophthalic acid units polymerized with ethylene glycol, and is available as Melty Fiber Type 4080 fromUnitika, Ltd. r Osaka, Japan. The fiber core base fiber has a melting temperature of approximately 2450C. The sheath has a sticking temperature of about llO0 l200C, as described below in Example 7. A dry fluffy fibrous sheet cut to a convenient size from the above formed web was shaped over a heated rigid cupped shaped silicone male mold maintained at 2500F, which is above the sticking temperature of the fiber sheath, the loose fibrous state permitting of conformation over the mold. This shaped fluffy sheet is then promptly sub acted to uniform soft pressing by bringing a heated, aluminum female mold of complementary contour to the male mold against the web covered male mold to compact and unify the web to a stable molded shape precisely conforming to the molds. The mask molds are preferably contoured to produce a mask having a cupped shaped body portion having an area in the range of 25 to 27 square inches. The molds may be ribbed or corrugated to further strengthen and stiffen the cupped shaped masks. The molding time is about six seconds at a temperature of about 2500F and a pressure of about 215 pounds applied over a projected area of 35.75 square inches. The stiffness of the molded mask was 1.71 pounds, measured on the King Fabric Stiffness Tester. The air pressure drop of the molded mask, measured by the Dwyer Manometer, was 0.6 mm. of water. Example 2 A dry fluffy fibrous web was formed according to the procedure set forth in Example 1 with 50 by weight of Melty Fiber Type 4080 and 50 by weight of polyester staple fibers, 6 dpf x 2 inch, Type 476, Finish 75, semi dull, crimped Celanese Fiber Industries, Inc.,Salisbury, N.C. , at a basis weight of 100 pounds per ream.The melting point of the Celanese polyester staple fiber is approximately 2450C. The web was molded as set forth inExample 1 and produced a molded mask having a stiffness value of 0.91 pounds on the King Fabric Stiffness Tester and an air pressure drop of 0.35 mm. of water. Example 3 A dry fluffy fibrous web was formed according to the procedure set forth in Example 1 with 75 by weight of Melty Fiber Type 4080 and 25 by weight of polyester staple fibers, 6 dpf x 2 inch, Type 476, Finish 75, semidull, crimped Celanese , at a basis weight of 65 pounds per ream. The web was molded as set forth in Example 1 and produced a molded mask having a stiffness value of 0.20 pounds on the King Fabric Stiffness Tester and an air pressure drop of 0.2 mm. of water. Surprisingly, this molded shape with a stiffness value as low as 0.20 libs. showed adequate efficacy as a face mask. Example 4 A dry fluffy fibrous web was formed according to the procedure set forth in Example 1 with 75 by weight of Melty Fiber Type 4080 and 25 by weight of electrically charged fibrillated isotactic polypropylene fibers, about 40 x 10 microns in cross section x 38 mm. length, FiltreteType G 3M Company, St. Paul, MN at a basis weight of 100 pounds per ream. The melting point of the Filtrate Type G fibers is approximately l650C. The web was molded as set forth in Example 1 and produced a molded mask having a stiffness value of 1.12 pounds on the King Fabric Stiffness Tester and an air pressure drop of 0.75 mm. of water. Example 5 A dry fluffy fibrous web was formed according to the procedure set forth in Example 1 with 50 by weight of Melty Fiber Type 4080 and 50 by weight of viscose rayon fiber, 3 dpf x 2 inch, American Enka Company, Des Plaines,IL at a basis weight of 100 pounds per ream. The web was molded as set forth in Example 1 and produced a molded mask having a stiffness value of 0.68 pounds on the King FabricStiffness Tester and an air pressure drop of 0.45 mm. of water. Example 6 A dry fluffy fibrous web was formed according to the procedure set forth in Example 1 with 50 by weight of Melty Fiber Type 4080 and 50 by weight of wood pulp fiber, average fiber length of 2.2 mm, Rayfluff X O ITTRayonier Inc., New York, NY at a basis weight of 100 pounds per ream. The web was molded as set forth inExample 1 and produced a molded mask having a stiffness value of 0.62 pounds on the King Fabric Stiffness Tester and an air pressure drop of 0.6 mm. of water. Examples 1 through 6 show that a precoated textile type fiber, such as Melty Fiber Type 4080N by itself or blended at a suitable ratio with other type fibers, such as specified in Examples 2 through 6, can be formed into a nonwoven web and molded to form an article which is sufficiently stiff, free of fuzz, and comfortable to the face so as to function as a face mask without the subsequent addition of a separate polymeric resin binder system to impart stiffness. It was ot saved that wevs comprised entirely or partially of Melty Fiber Type 4080, similar to those discussed in Examples 1 to 6, stuck to the molds when the molding temperature as about 300vEX or higher. To insure proper molding, Ir , necessary that the molding temperature be above the sticking temperature of the polymer coating but below the softening point of the base fiber so that the fibrous nature of the molded article is maintained.However, it is believed that as the molding temperature approaches the temperature range where the melt flow of the coating is significant, sticking of the molded article to the mold surface can occur. Examples 7 13 A dry, fluffy fibrous web was made utilizing polyester staple fibers, 6 dpf x 2 inch of Example 2 Celanese by the method described in Example 1. The basis weight of the web was 88 pounds per ream. A 25 solids solution of Vitel PE 200 amorphous non crystallizable copolyester manufactured by Goodyear in methyl ethyl ketone and toluene was squeeze roll coated onto the polyester web. After drying, the web was reweighed and showed that 32 pounds per ream of the amorphous copolyester was deposited on the fibers of the web. The coated web, which was now highly compacted and with the fibers tightly bonded together, was reopened , using conventional means, such as the lickerin portion of a Rando Webber, and formed into a lofty fibrous web. This lofty fibrous web was molded following the procedure of Example 1 to yield a face mask which was sufficiently rigid without the use of a separate binder system. The same procedure was repeated using other base fibers and polymeric coatings whose physical properties are summarized in Table I. The polymeric coatings are characterized by the temperature at which they stick to stainless steel. The sticking temperature is the temperature at which the polymeric coating begins to adhere to the stainless steel top of a Kofler hot bench. At this temperature the polymeric coating also adheres to itself under the pressure of molding. Table I PressureEx. Sticking Mold Wt. Ratio Stiffness DropNo. Base Fiber Polymer Coating Temp.

It is contemplated that the coated fibers ofExamples 7 to 13 can be blended with other fibers as inExamples 2 through 6 to form suitable molded shapes. In an effort to determine whether shaped nonwoven products could be produced by utilizing the components in a form other than a base fiber with a coating in intimate association with thb base fiber, the following experiment was carried out. Melt blown fibers were produced from a polyester resin comprising a random copolyester composite of 80 terephthalic acid units and 20 isophthalic acid units polymerized with ethylene glycol. In the melt blown fiber process, the polymer is converted into nonwoven webs directly from the melt by extruding, attenuating, cooling, and collecting fibers on a moving belt in a rapid continuous fashion generally as taught in U.S. Patent 3,971,373. The attenuation and cooling are done with airstreams acting at the point of extrusion.These fibers showed a melting point of 1600C. The melt blown polyester nonwoven web was subsequently opened and mixed with 50 by weight of polyester staple fiber, 6 dpf x 2 inch ofExample 2 Celanese . The fiber mixture was used to produce an air laid nonwoven web as described above inExamples 2 6 at a basis weight of 100 pounds per ream. The web was molded as set forth in Example I for six seconds at a temperature of about 2500F and a force of about 215 pounds over a projected area of 35.75 sq.in. The molded form stuck to the mold and was deformed in removal from the mold. While the stiffness of the molded form was 0.35 pounds, the surface of the molded form was rough and fuzzy, uncomfortable during wearing and would require at least additional interfiber bonding with a polymeric latex to be a useful molded mask. This experiment clearly shows that although a bonding material of substantially the same chemical composition as the sheath of the Melty Fiber Type 4080 the melt blown polyester fibers is utilized, unless the bonding material is present as an intimate coating on the base fiber, a useful product cannot be produced.
