# Foam extrusion apparatus.

## Abstract
A foam extrusion apparatus and method employs tan dem extruders 12 mounted on horizontal rails 25,26 for movement toward and away from the end of a vacuum chamber 10 which is in the form of an elongated inclined barometric leg. The upper end of the chamber 10 is closed by a substantial bulkhead 40 also supported on rails and held in inclined position to close the end of the chamber 10 when moved thereagainst. A die 42 is positioned on the inside of the bulkhead 40 and aligned with the leg 10 when closed. The extruders 12 are connected to the die 42 through a length of pipe 37 supported through the bulkhead 40 by a stainless steel bellows 120 . The pipe 37 externally of the bulkhead 40 is provided with a circulating jacket for tempera ture control. The die is adjustable externally 136 of the bulk head 40 . The extruders 12 , die 42 and bulkhead 40 are movable as a unit or separately toward and away from the chamber to provide access to the die and the interior of the chamber.
