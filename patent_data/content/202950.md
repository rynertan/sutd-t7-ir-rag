## Description
The invention relates to novel berban derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, to the use as well as to a process for preparing the novel compounds. It has been known for a long time that the alkaloids of the Rauwolfia plant family and their analogues with a berban skeleton are biologically active and possess in some cases valuable pharmacological activity. Antiinflammatory Acta. Chim. Acad. Sci. Hung. It is known that the noradrenergic part of the central nervous system plays an important role in the antidepressive action of some compounds Trends in Pharm. Sci., It has been aimed to prepared therapeutically useful novel compounds which are more selective than the α₂ antagonists known so far. Thus, the invention relates to new racemic or optically active berban derivatives of the general formula I wherein The meanings of these substituents are always the same in this description and will not be repeated below. An other embodiment of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of the new compounds of general formula I and the salts thereof, which comprises reducing a racemic or optically active oxo compound of the general formula II , wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are the same as above, and optionally resolving, alkylating or acylating the obtained compound of general formula I in a known method. For the preparation of the acid addition salts of the compounds of general formula I , organic and inorganic acids such as tartaric or citric acid and hydrochloric or sulphuric acid may be used. The reduction of the compounds of the general formula II can be carried out by using metal hydrides, e.g. sodium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride or lithium tris 2 butyl borohydride or by using hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, or by the means of sulphur containing substances, aluminium alkoxides, nascent hydrogen or by using other reagents which are useful to saturate the carbon oxygen double bond. In the course of preparing the compounds of general formula I , the nature of the selected reducing agent influences the ratio of the stereoisomers containing the C₁₄ hydroxyl group in the equatorial or axial position. For example when the space demand of the metal hydride used for the reduction is enhanced, then the ratio of the isomer containing the C₁₄ hydroxyl group in the axial position is increased in the product obtained. Using sodium borohydride for the reduction, the isomer containing the C₁₄ hydroxyl group in the axial position amounts to 80 . When using lithium tris 2 butyl borohydride, the product obtained contains nearly exclusively the stereoisomer containing the C₁₄ hydroxyl group in the axial position. When carrying out the reduction with a system consisting of an alkaline metal and an alcohol, i.e. by using nascent hydrogen, the thermodynamically favourable derivative containing the hydroxyl group in the equatorial 14α position is obtained. The racemic or optically active compounds of general formula II can be prepared by using methods known from the literature Chem. Ber., On investigating the compounds of general formula I , it has been found that they show a substantially more selective antagonism against the α₂ adrenergic receptors as compared to the substances known so far yohimbine, phentolamine, idazoxan, imiloxan see, Drugs of the Future, The above statements are based on the following test results The tissues were suspended at 37 C in an organ bath containing 5 ml of Krebs solution. The stimulation was achieved according Field s method by using rectangular impulses with a frequency of 0.1 Hz, supramaximal potential and an impulse duration of 1 ms . Both the compounds of general formula I and the reference substances were tested against xylazine on the rat vas daferens as well as against epinephrine on the longitudinal smooth muscle preparation from the guinea pig ileum . The amplitude of the contraction response caused by the stimulation is inhibited on the α₂ adrenergic receptors by xylazine or norepinephrine. This effect is abolished by the blocking substances. The pA₂ value of the blocking substances was calculated by the means of the negative logarithm of the molar concentration of the blocking substances establishing a dose ratio of 2 Arunlakshana and Schild Br. J. Pharmacol., Phenylephrine was used as agonist on the α₁ adrenergic receptors whereby both the rat vas deferens and the pulmonary artery of the rabbit were contracted. This concractile effect was inhibited by antagonists. The pA₂ value was determined by using the method of Arunlakshana and Schield 1959 cited above. The nature of the competition is also given NC means non competitive, C means competitive . On the α₁ receptors of the pulmonary artery, a contraction is elicited by norepinephrine which is inhibited by antagonists. The pA₂ values and the nature of the competition were determined by using the method of Arunlakshana and Schild 1959 cited above NC means non competitive C means competitive . The selectivity values were calculated on the basis of Tables 1 and 2. The pA₂ values concerning the α₁ receptor of the antagonists were divided by the pA₂ values concerning the α₂ receptor of the antagonists α₁ α₂ . The higher is this ratio, the more selective is the given compound. The low ratio of yohimbine, thought to be a selective antagonist, is surprising. Male rats with 100 g of body weight were intraperitoneally pre treated at minute 0 with 320 mg kg of α methyl p tyrosinc. The animals of the control group as well as the group treated with the compounds of the general formula I 4 animals in each group were killed it, the 30th, 60th, 90th and 120th minute, respectively, and the frontal cortex and the striatum were prepared and homogenized in perchloric acid of 0.2 mole litre concentration. After centrifuging, the norepinephrine content frontal cortex or the dopamine content striatum of the supernatant, respectively, was determined by using the method of the intense liquid chromatography electrochemical detection. The fractional rate constant of the catecholamine development k The pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of the general formula I may be prepared according to known methods, by using one or more representatives of compounds of the general formula I together with additives commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. The thus prepared pharamaceutical compositions may be administed orally, parenterally, intravenously or intramuscularly. Preferred forms of the pharmaceutical compositions are the tablets, dragées, capsules, powder mixtures, aqueous suspensions, solutions or injectable solutions. The active ingredient content of the compositions may be varied under wide limits from 0.005 to 90 For the treatment of depressions, the compounds of the general formula I may preferably be used in a daily dose of 5 to 20 mg administered at once or divided in several subdoses. The above dose range is only informative although this may be varied according to the exercise of the physician s discretion.
