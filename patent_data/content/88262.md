# Automatic film threading mechanism.

## Abstract
An automatic film threading device adapted for use with cameras or projection devices will drive the free end of the roll of film from a magazine along a film path and into the equipment. The threading mechanism comprises a drive for the reel and means for spreading the mouth of the magazine to free the film from the magazine. A second member moves into contact with the outer surface of the wound film to strip the free end from the roll of film and thread the same into a nip area between two drive rollers. The stripping member is biased toward the wound roll of film and a roller near the stripping finger engages the outer convolution of the wound film to hold the roll as the stripping finger contacts the film to direct the free end of the film off the reel. The means for spreading the mouth of the magazine comprise a pair of arms which extend into the magazine and which diverge from a pivot point adjacent one side of the magazine and a spring is provided for positioning and biasing the arms into the magazine.
