# Composite compressor wheel for radial compressors.

## Abstract
A centrifugal compressor wheel for example for a turbo charger consists of a cast blade shell 12 formed with a hub 15 and integral blades 14 and a back plate 20 in which is formed a conical recess 30 . A hub insert 16 which is forged or machined or otherwise non cast to be more resistant to fa tigue failure than the blade shell, is secured in the recess, pre ferably by inertia welding, to form an intimate bond over sub stantially the whole surface of the recess in a position such that the greatest stresses to be experienced in use will occur in the hub insert rather than the blade shell. A bore 46 is formed in the blade shell and hub insert for mounting on a blower shaft.
