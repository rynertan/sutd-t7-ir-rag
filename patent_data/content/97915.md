# Method for producing silicone elastomeric foam.

## Abstract
A simplified method of manufacturing a silicone elas tomeric foam comprises mechanically generating a stable froth of an aqueous silicone emulsion, while adding surfac tant and thickener, then removing the water from the stable froth. The emulsion consists essentially of anionically stabil ized hydroxyl endblocked polydiorganosiloxane colloidal silica, an organic tin compound, and water, the emulsion having a pH in the range or 9 to 11.5 inclusive. The dried foam is an elastomeric, cellular structure possessing typical silicone elastomer neat stability.
