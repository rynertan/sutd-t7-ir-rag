# METHOD FOR PRODUCING PLASTIC OPTICAL FIBER WITH HEAT RESISTANCE

## Abstract
A plastic optical fiber with excellent heat resistance comprising a core made of a polymer comprising units of methyl methacrylate and a cladding made of a polymer containing at least 20 by weight of fluorine is produced by washing the core polymer with an organic solvent in which the core polymer is substantially insoluble, forming the core from the washed core polymer and forming the cladding around the core.
