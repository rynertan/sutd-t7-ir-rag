# REDUCTION OF RUPTURE STRENGTH OF METAL CANS

## Abstract
To guard against explosion, the rupture strength of an electrolytic capacitor can 11 is weakened in a controlled manner by impressing a cruciform partial shear pattern 10 in its base. When the can is subjected to excessive pressure a slow leak initially develops at the centre of the cross, and a further pressure rise is required before the leak rate is augmented by a progressive separation of the quadrants along the shear lines.
