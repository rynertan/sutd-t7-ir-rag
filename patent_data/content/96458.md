# Elastic films, method for their preparation and their use in contact with the skin.

## Abstract
An apertured elastic film comprising a blend of polyurethane and an incompatible polymer which forms a discrete phase within the matrix of polyurethane, a process for its preparation, and the use of the film in elastic articles for bodily contact. In a highly favoured aspect the elastic apertured film is in the form of a net. The nets may be prepared by forming a film having thicker and thinner areas and stretching that film until apertures are formed. During stretching voiding of the film occurs which is then followed by rupture of the thinner areas to form apertures.
