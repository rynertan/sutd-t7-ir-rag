# Process for the preparation of a starting material for the production of phenylalanine.

## Abstract
A precursor of phenylalanine containing as a major component 5 benzylhydantoin is prepared by reacting, in an aqueous medium, a bisulfite addition salt of phenyl acetaldehyde with cyanic and carbonic ions, each being in a molar ratio of equimol or more to said bisulfite addition salt and ammonium ion in a molar ratio of 2 or more to said carbonic ion. The thus prepared precursor of phenylalanine may be converted into phenylalanine by a hydrolysis under a basic or acidic condition.
