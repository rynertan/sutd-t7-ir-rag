# Firing pin block for firearm having a reciprocating breech bolt.

## Abstract
A firing pin block for a firearm of the type having a recip rocating bolt assembly including a breech bolt and slide block, a firing pin, and a pivotal locking block. The slide block and locking block have cam means which cooperate to pivot the locking block in and out of locking engagement with a recess in the barrel as the slide block is reciprocated to close and open the bolt. The operation of these cam means is coordi nated with relative longitudinal displacements between the bolt and slide block so that, at any time the bolt is unlocked, the slide block prevents sufficient forward movement of an abutment on the firing pin to cause the firearm to discharge. This firing pin block is effective even though the firing pin spring and retaining pin may be broken, distorted, or missing and forceably retracts the firing pin even if it is bent and jammed.
