## Description
This invention relates to chemical vapor deposition of compounds of the titanium sub group of elements and applies in addition to the vanadium sub group and chromium sub group of elements as coatings on a chosen substrate at low temperatures. Such coatings can have various uses when applied to a substrate. For example, coatings of the titanium sub groups are desirable on metalworking tools to increase the useful life of the tool. Others, such as niobium nitride coatings are useful as a super conductive material. Depending upon the use to which the coating is to be put or the substrate on which the coating is put, the temperature at which a coating can be deposited may be important. Critical temperatures are often involved above which the properties of the substrate are altered. For coating drills and machine tools with compounds of the titanium sub group of elements to lengthen the useful life of the tool, nitrides, carbides and carbonitrides of titanium metal are desirable coatings. Compounds such as titanium nitride can be deposited as coatings by chemical vapor deposition CVD at temperatures of about 1000 C or higher. However, most tool steels are hardened and tempered and if temperatures exceeding the tempering temperatures are used, the tools lose their temper and must be re heat treated. When re heat treated, distortion becomes a problem and tool tolerances are affected. Thus, it is preferable to carry out any coating deposition at temperatures below the softening point of the tool metal in order to avoid affecting the temper of the tool steel. The coating of metalworking tools with titanium nitride, is a typical example of a coating situation in which low temperature deposition of the coating is desirable. Present processes deposit titanium nitride by chemical vapor deposition by passing titanium tetrachloride, nitrogen and hydrogen over the substrate at temperatures of about 1000 C. or higher. Other existing processes, also operating in the range of 1000 C. add a hydrocarbon gas, such as methane, to include titanium carbide in the coating deposit. These temperatures have detrimental effects on tool steel temper. Re heat treating to re establish temper detrimentally affects tolerances. For example, tempered steel will lose hardness above 500 to 600 C., stainless steel will sensitize above 550 C. and nickel based super alloys overage above 600 C. It has been found that low deposition temperatures below the temper temperatures of such metals can be used to deposit metal compound coatings of the type discussed above by utilizing sub halide compounds of the metal in question in the deposition reaction. The phrase metal sub halides refers to metal halides in which the metal exhibits a valency state oxidation state lower than the maximum valency state known for a halide of that metal. For example, the maximum valency for a halide of titanium is 4, In Document CA A 1,087,041, the deposition of hafnium carbide and hafnium nitride coatings by chemical vapor deposition is discussed. At that time, temperatures typically in the neighborhood of 1,300 C. were required to produce hafnium coatings by chemical vapor deposition. That patent discloses the use of the sub halides of hafnium in the deposition process, and thereby achieve temperatures as low as 900 C. in the deposition reaction. However, as discussed above, 900 C. is still above the temper loss point for many alloys that it is desirable to coat. The above discussed drawbacks of the prior art are avoided by a method of producing coatings of a metal nitride, or a metal carbide, or a metal carbonitride of at least one of the metals titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten on a substrate by In a preferred embodiment, titanium nitride coatings have been produced on a substrate by passing a controlled flow at about 400 volumes of hydrogen and about 10 volumes or hydrogen chloride over a bed of titanium metal particles heated to about 500 C., mixing 1000 volumes of hydrogen and 150 volumes of nitrogen with the resulting hydrogen and titanium chloride and passing the gaseous mixture over a substrate heated to about 600 C. Further improvements and modifications in the process include mixing the nitrogen with the hydrogen before passing the mixture over the titanium metal particles and ammonia gas with the hydrogen and nitrogen mixture prior to introducing it to the substrate but continuing the addition of ammonia gas for a limited period of time. Further improvement and modification are obtained by varying the pressure of the gaseous mixture passed over the substrate and maintaining the pressure of the mixed gas around the substrate at a pressure not more than about 533 Pa. The selection of pressure is such as to produce Knudsen flow of the gas. A thermodynamic analysis indicates that the lower halides or sub halides of titanium, and in particular, titanium bichloride TiCl₂ , and titanium trichloride TiCl₃ subchlorides of titanium facilitate a larger reaction negative free energy value and accordingly a greater potential for reaction involving the deposition of TiN by CVD at low temperatures. Indeed, the potential of titanium bichloride and titanium trichloride to react with nitrogen and hydrogen in a gaseous environment to deposit titanium nitride continues to increase right down to 0 K. Nonetheless, reaction kinetics can inhibit the deposition of titanium nitride at low temperatures. However, it has been found that the potential for the reaction of TiCl₂ and TiCl₃ to form titanium nitride can be tapped in a vapor environment containing nitrogen and hydrogen using reaction temperatures in the range of 250 C. to 850 C. Although even lower coating temperatures are possible depending on deposition conditions used to overcome unfavorable kinetics, the temperatures used are intended to take full advantage of the favorable coating rates at a temperature which does not result in loss of temper or hardness in the tool substrates or item being coated. It is essential to keep the free energy of the reaction at or about a predetermined negative value in order that the temperature at which the reaction and the deposition of titanium nitride, in the case of titanium, takes place will be maintained in this temperature range. In particular, the higher the equilibrium constant K Accordingly, titanium nitride is deposited by chemical vapor deposition by reacting titanium bichloride and or titanium trichloride with hydrogen and nitrogen, and optionally some ammonia, at a suitable temperature that will not detrimentally affect substrate properties and using flow rates which maintain partial pressures of the reactants, TiCl₂ and TiCl₃, at relatively high levels. The favorable thermodynamics and kinetic factors are thereby utilized for the deposition of titanium nitride at the desirable temperature. Titanium bichloride and titanium trichloride, because of their thermodynamic characteristics in reaction, are important ingredients in the reaction for the deposition of titanium nitride. Titanium bichloride and titanium trichloride can be produced by the reduction of titanium tetrachloride, but such reduction yields quantities of both that are smaller than are required to conduct the deposition of TiN at suitably high rates. Titanium bichloride and titanium trichloride can, of course, be obtained from other sources and simply be fed to a chemical vapor deposition chamber for the production of titanium nitride. Alternatively, a second embodiment of the invention involves a preliminary in situ step for the production of titanium sub chlorides by passing hydrogen chloride over titanium metal. Such reaction will produce titanium bichloride, titanium trichloride, and titanium tetrachloride and their relative proportions in the gas reaction mixture can be varied by manipulating the titanium metal chlorination conditions such as temperature or the partial pressures of hydrogen and the chlorinating agents such as hydrogen chloride. To increase the concentration of TiCl₂ and TiCl₃, which are less volatile than TiCl₄, in the gas reaction mixture, the in situ chlorination of titanium metal and the deposition of TiN in the two stage process can also be conducted at low pressures. Reduction of pressure in the chlorination process facilitates vaporization of the sub chlorides which have a higher vaporization temperature than TiCl₄. This, in turn, permits chlorination to be performed at a lower temperature which, in turn, promotes production of the sub chlorides. The use of low pressures in the vicinity of 533 Pa pressure in the second stage of the process, that is the deposition of titanium nitride, also enhance the operation by improving the kinetic factors which favor deposition of titanium nitride on the substrate. The invention will be better understood with reference to examples which follow and with reference to the following figures, in which Figure 1 includes a thermodynamic evaluation of the potential reactions available in a CVD coating process using titanium chlorides and indicates what reactant is preferable for reaction in any desired temperature range. In particular, Figure 1 shows the standard free energy versus temperature plots for reactions 1, 2 and 3 below Figure 1 indicates the standard free energy values ΔG for these reactions at reaction temperatures ranging from 273 C. 0 K. to 1627 C. 1900 K. As indicated, the lower the free energy value the greater is the potential for reaction, although there is a point beyond which it is difficult to tap this potential due to unfavorable kinetics. The plots in Figure 1 disclose that whereas TiCl₄ can be effective in depositing TiN at temperatures of 727 C. 1000 K. and greater, TiCl₃ and TiCl₂ have potential for participating in the above reactions and depositing TiN at reactions temperatures down to 273 C. 0 K. . The potential for reaction of the latter compounds is due to the large negative free energy change accompanying reactions 2 and 3 . The formation of TiN from TiCl₂ or TiCl₃ becomes more favorable as the temperature is decreased. Nonetheless, at 273 C. absolute 0 K. any reaction would be very limited because of unfavorable kinetics. In addition, to trigger the reaction at any temperature requires manipulation of the physical process variables K wherein P HCl denotes the partial pressure of HCl at the reaction temperature T. As can be seen from equation 5 the free energy change ΔG Therefore, from Figure 1, using TiCl₃, it will be seen that for TiCl₃ to participate in reaction 2 at a temperature of about 500 C., the free energy value needs to be in the range of 603 kJ per mole of TiN. With these free energy and temperature values, equation 5 then determines a fixed value for K Process apparatus for carrying out TiN deposition will now be described and will be followed by examples of deposition of TiN coatings on substrates at the desired reaction temperatures by varying and manipulating the process variables. Figure 2 shows a process apparatus which comprises two basic reaction chambers, a first chlorination chamber 1 upstream of and connected integrally with a coating chamber 2. The chlorination chamber is heated by a conventional resistively heated furnace 4. The tool substrate 3 is mounted within the coating chamber 2 and the chamber 2 is heated using conventional resistive heating means 5. In addition and alternatively, the substrate 3 is independently heated in the coating chamber utilizing a conventional resistively heated cartridge heater 6. In chamber 1, the resistance heated furnace 4 heats titanium Ti metal chips from 150 C. to 1100 C. and HCl and H₂ are fed through flow meters 7, passed over the heated titanium 8 to produce TiCl₂ and TiCl₃ and hydrogen in accordance with the following resultant reactions This reaction may also produce quantities of TiCl₄. However, the parameters of this reaction are controlled by using suitable combinations of reaction temperatures, and relative flow rates of H₂ and HCl to provide lower partial pressures of HCl, to steer the reaction towards predominant production of TiCl₃ and TiCl₂. The TiCl₂ and TiCl₃ gases are carried by a carrier gas such as hydrogen or helium from chlorination chamber 1 to coating chamber 2 to which hydrogen and nitrogen are fed through flowmeters to foster reactions 2 and 3 . Before reaching chamber 2, the hydrogen and nitrogen are preheated by passing through the furnace 4 in an annular chamber about reaction chamber 1. As discussed above, for the desired reactions 2 and 3 at a temperature in the range of 250 C. to 850 C. the value of Kp is fixed thermodynamically by formula 5 and a range of flow rates and partial pressure values can be determined. As will be appreciated, the flow rates chosen will affect the kinetics of the reaction. All the following examples are carried out on equipment of the type generally illustrated in Figure 2 and produced TiN coatings, and except where indicated otherwise the equipment is operated at atmospheric pressure. It has been further found that the quality of the deposit and the rate of deposition of TiN in the above CVD reactions can be improved by the addition of ammonia to the gas reaction mixture. In the examples which follow, substrate materials such as copper, stainless steel and nickel based super alloy are independently heated in the coating chamber by mounting them on a cartridge heater. The temperature of the cartridge heater was controlled using a temperature controller. Temperatures of the copper, stainless steel and nickel based super alloy substrate materials are monitored using a separate thermocouple attached to their surfaces. The walls of the coating chamber are maintained at a constant temperature using the resistively heated furnace arrangement, as in the previous examples in Tables II and III. It is, of course, always important to have the coating chamber and its walls at a temperature high enough to keep the metal sub halides in the gas phase and avoid any condensing out at the walls. A coating period of one hour and atmospheric operating pressure is used for all the coating runs summarized in Table IV. In all of the examples given in Table IV the same chlorination step in chamber 1 is conducted at 500 C. and at flow rates of 10 ml min. of HCl and 400 ml min. of H₂. Details of the deposition conditions used are given in Table IV. From the previous examples relating to the use of ammonia, it can be seen from the results given in Table IV that ammonia is not only effective in enhancing the deposition of TiN thermodynamically as a comparison of the examples 1 with 4 shows but also improves the kinetics of the deposition of TiN, as a comparison of the examples 3 with 1, 2, and 4 illustrates. The examples shown in Table V illustrate the advantages of pressure reduction in the chamber where a coating is occurring and in the chlorination process. It will be seen in Table V, with a pressure in the coating chamber of 266.6 Pa and flow rates as shown and the addition of ammonia, good coatings are obtained. Table V also illustrates, in the third example, the effect of introducing the nitrogen in the first stage of the process during chlorination. Unexpectedly, the nitrogen does not result in nitrides being retained in the first reaction but permits a better control. In the third example with a flow rate of 20 millilitres of hydrogen and 6 millilitres of HCl and 20 millilitres of N₂ with the chamber pressure of 200 Pa 1.5 millimeters of mercury a suitable coating could be obtained. While Table V illustrates examples of operation at reduced pressure, it has been found that introduction of nitrogen in the first stage is also practical at atmospheric pressures. A detailed description of the procedure used in coating with particular reference to the first example of Table V follows. The apparatus is partially evacuated through the exhaust with all inlet gas flows shut off. The whole apparatus is flushed with a gas such as hydrogen or helium which is not reactive with other materials. Flushing is continued to rid the apparatus of water vapor and oxygen. The temperature of the titanium is raised to 500 C. by furnace 4 and the temperature of substrate 3 is raised to 600 C. by heating means 5. These temperatures are measured by suitably located thermocouples. The pressure within the apparatus is reduced. Hydrogen and hydrogen chloride at volume ratio of 40 12 is now permitted to flow over the titanium and hydrogen nitrogen and ammonia in the volume ratio of 20 10 3 are mixed with the resulting gases from the first stage. The mixed gases flow into chamber 2 and a total pressure of about 266 Pa is maintained. The temperatures, gas flows and pressures are maintained for a suitable period of time, one hour for example. At the end of the cycle the apparatus is permitted to cool down, the gas flow reverted to inert gas and the workpiece removed. Preferably the stage 1 portion of the apparatus is at least partially sealed off before the chamber 2 is opened to atmosphere thus simplifying the flushing process in the next cycle. It will be understood that the above disclosure has dealt with TiN coatings only by way of example. The low temperature deposition principles disclosed above apply equally to the deposit of zirconium nitride, hafnium nitride, carbides and carbonitrides of titanium, zirconium and hafnium, nitrides, carbides and carbonitrides of vanadium, niobium and tantalum the vanadium sub group of metals and of chromium molybdenum and tungsten the chromium sub group of metals . In fact, the invention applies to coatings of compounds of at least one of those metals of Group 4A, Group 5A and Group 6A because these metals have a variable valency and it is possible to use those valencies which have the lower free energy of formation when forming metallic halides. In the case of carbide coatings the reactant gases in the deposition reaction are a hydrocarbon such as CH₄, H₂ and the metal sub halide. In the case of carbonitride coatings the reactant gases in the deposition reaction are hydrocarbon such as CH₄, H₂ and N₂ and or NH₃ and the metal sub halide. The substrates mentioned in this disclosure are exemplary, not exclusive. Other known substrates can be coated using the method and apparatus of this invention. Other known inert gas can be used.
