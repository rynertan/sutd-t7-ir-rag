# Pinned component, e.g. for textile machinery and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A pinned component for use in textile finishing machines and other purposes, the component having a plurality of pins projecting from the surface of its body and wherein the sur face of the body is given a textured finish by means of a sandblasting or chemical etching process. The sandblasting or etching removes unwanted burrs or the like from the sur face of the body and if the pins are secured in their apertures with adhesive will also remove excess adhesive, thereby allowing the component to operate more efficiently. A typical component which would incorporate the invention would be an opening roller for an open end spinning machine.

## Description
Pinned component for textile machinery and method This invention relates to pinned components for treating textiles and other fibres and is particulary applicable to pinned textile carding, combining and opening equipment and to pinned opening rollers for open cad spinning machines and to pinned combing elementes for half lap combing machines and rollers or segments of rollers or carding apparatus, and I a method of treating the pinned components to improve thei performance. Nowadays,pinned components often have an essentially cylindrical or part cylindrical metallic body presenting a surface covered with pin points. These pin n points are formed by mounting or setting suitably hardened or tempered steel pins kno fn in t ne trade as textile pins, within drill cud apertures in the body. The pins are often held in place with the aid of a polymer adhesive. Because the surface for receiving the pins has to be machined and drilled, it is liable to be marked by burrs and other irregularities, and these can cause snagging of the textile material being treated by the component. Also, cured o part cured adhesive can remain on the surface, especially around the pin roots. Any or all of these faults can cause fibrous material to adirere to the surface. Even if the surface is free of burr ano other irregularities and is therefore substantially smooth, it can tend to attract textile material due to suction forces being set up as a result of raid rotation of the component. The present invention seeks to overcome these disadvantages. According to cne aspect of the present invention, we provide a pinned component having a metallic body portion frori a surface of which textile pins project, and wherein the pinned surface is of a smooth but textured nature. B a smooth but textured surface, we mean, for example, one which is similar in nature to the skin of an orange. Preferably, the body of the component is formed of aluminium, or an aluminium alloy, and the pins are made of steel.The pins ma form a force fit in apertures in the body but preferably, the are secured in the body in the manner described in our U.K. Patent specification No. 1298561. Also according to the one embodiment of title present invention, we provide a method of forming a pinned component as described above wherein the surface of the component from which the pins project is textured by shot blasting. Preferably, this operation is carried out after the surface has beer pinllcd, thereby ensuring that burrs and or excess adhesive used for securing the pins in place is are removed from the surface and around the base of the pins. Preferably, spherical glass beads having a diameter of bet we en 45 and 85 microns are used for the shot blasting process. It has been found that these do not affect the surface of the pins, and can in fact smooth the surface of the pins, whereas the softer material of the body is texturised. In an alternative embodiment the textured surface is provided by a chemical etching process, using any one of a number of commercially available chemical etchants. If the pins are formed of stainless steel, then the pinned component can be etched subsequent to pinning, otherwise the process would be performed prior to pinning. In our U.V. Patent No. 1298561 corresponding U.S. Patent No,3730802 we disclose a method of locating discrete pins in a matrix by means of suitable thermosetting or thermoplastic adhesive. Basically, the method disclosed is to provide oversized holes for the pin shanks in the matrix c.g. a roller, and secure the pins in position using the adhesive. In manufacturing pinned components using a metallic body, in accordance with our patented method, we oftcr experience difficulties in removing ur rranted adhesive, e.o. set resin,from the exposed, i.e. non pinned, fibre handling face of the body.We have now found that by mechanically or chemically treating the pinned components in accordance orith the present invention, the unwanted adhesive is easily removed, as are undesirable burrs and othcr irrcgularitics in or on the surface of the component from whicll the pins project. lle have found that sitgni ficant advantages can be obtained by using pined components having a textured surface on the body of the component in accordance with the present invention as opening rollers especially for open end spinning machines. Surprisingly, significant improvements to the spinning characteristics of the open end spinning machine have resulted which we believe are caused because the smooth textured surface of th e component does not attract textile material, and can therefore operate at maximurn efficiency. Ye have also found that other textile machine components such as combes half laps and carding staves when made or treated in accordance with the invention have a considerably reduced tendency for fibres to be broken and snagged by the surface of the component. Although it is envisaged that the pinned component would normally be mechanically or chemically treated after the fixing of the pins in position, it is believed that improved results can be obtained if just the drilled surface of the body of the components from which the pins trill project is treated, prior to insertion of the pins. Although the textured pinned components disclosed herein are especially suited to textile processing, treating or finishing, it will be appreciated that the components can be used for other purposes. For example, pinned components having a textured surface on the body from which the pins project can be used for fibrillating and other slitting or shredding operations, e.g. in the tobacco industry.
