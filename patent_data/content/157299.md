# Image processing apparatus.

## Abstract
A three dimensional object recognition system accord ing to the present invention comprising three dimensional position measurement means 6 to measure from a two di mensional image of an object 1 to be recognized, three di mensional positions of at least three points on an edge line of a specified polygonal plane of an object surface of the image image processing means 3 to find on the basis of the three dimensional position information, direction vec tors of respective sides of the edge line as well as a normal vector of the polygonal plane and also edge angles of the respective sides of the edge line relative to a specified di rection and contour line extraction means 4 to select a fil ter suited for the polygonal plane on the basis of the edge angles and to detect the edge line from two dimensional image data of the object 1 via a filtering process of the filter.
