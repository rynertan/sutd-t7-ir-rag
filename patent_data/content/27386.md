# Process for producing propylene resin composition and molded articles of said composition.

## Abstract
The impact strength, particularly at low temperatures, of a chemically blended propylene resin composition having an ethylene content of 1 to 40 moles based on the entire monomer units of the resin composition and produced by a process which comprises i a pre polymerization step and ii a multiplicity of subsequent polymerization steps, is im proved when I the pre polymerization step i is I A a step wherein 1 to 1500 g, per millimole of titanium atom, of ethyl ene is polymerized, or I B a step wherein 1 to 1500 g, per mil limole of titanium atom, of propylene is polymerized, or I C a step wherein 1 to 1000 g, per millimole of titanium atom, of an alpha olefin having 4 to 10 carbon atoms is polymerized, and II said multiplicity of polymerization steps ii are carried out in separate reaction zones different from the reaction zone of the pre polymerization step i and are II I a step of poly merizing propylene to form not less than 5000 g, per milli mole of titanium atom, of crystalline polypropylene having an isotactic index of at least 90 which accounts for 55 to 95 by weight of the final resin composition, provided that when step I B is employed as the pre polymerization step i , the amount of the product includes that of polypropylene formed in step I B , II 2 a step of polymerizing propylene and ethyl ene to form an amorphous or a low crystalline propylene ethylene copolymer containing 20 to 80 mole of propylene units, and II 3 a step of polymerizing ethylene, or both ethyl ene and propylene, to form crystalline polyethylene or a cry stalline ethylene propylene copolymer containing up to 20 mole of propylene units, the polymerization steps ii being carried out in the order II 1 , II 2 , II 3 or II 1 , II 3 , II 2 .
