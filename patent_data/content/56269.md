# Silicate treatment for coated substrate.

## Abstract
Metals, particularly ferrous metals, coated for corrosion resistance with coatings containing particulate metal and hexa valent chromium providing substance can now be made fur ther corrosion resistant, as well as heat resistant, with a top coat of silica substance. In addition, mar resistance plus im proved outdoor weathering is also achieved, without sacrifice to other characteristics, e.g., coating adhesion.
