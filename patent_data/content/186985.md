# Diene elastomer compositions.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a diene elastomer composition especially suitable as tread rubber of tires which has low rolling resistance and high wet grip in combination. This elastomer composition contains a rubber material comprising an elastomeric polymer component of a butadiene polymer and or a styrene butadiene copolymer and a rubbery component. The elastomeric polymer is produced by using an organolithium compound as a poly merization initiator, and has a long chain end concentration LCEC of 1.5 or less as defined by the following formula LCEC βi x α x 10⁵
