# Method of connecting a pull tab to a slider body.

## Abstract
A pull tab connector for slide fastener sliders comprises a closed loop 10 formed of a piece of resilient wire and having a pair of stems 11,11 projecting from the loop, the stems being joined together and overlapping each other. The stems 11,11 are aligned with each other in a plane perpendicular to the general plane of the loop. In use, the stems 11,11 of the loop 10 are angularly moved about one another until they are aligned with each other in the general plane of the loop. Then the stems 11,11 are inserted in an axial hole 15 in a pull tab 14 , while a pair of bottom portions 10a,10a of the loop 10 are received in a transverse recess 13 in the pull tab 14 which recess communicates with the axial hole 15 .
