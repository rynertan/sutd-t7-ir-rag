# Sheet stacking system for producing a stack of flexible sheets including adjacent offset groups.

## Abstract
In a system for stacking sheets in edge offset groups, each sheet is fed through an aligner station to the stack. The aligner has two edge alignment walls 207, 216 and drive means 208, 209 for diverting sheets towards the walls. Wall 216 is movable from the position shown to a lower position at which it is interposed between wall 207 and the sheets. Thus, in accordance with the position of wall 216, each sheet is stacked with its side edge alignment defined by either wall 207 or wall 216.
