# Stopper remover.

## Abstract
A tool for removing headed stoppers from bottles such as champagne bottles, includes a base 18 having a two fingered yoke 30, 32 and a side support 20 , sized and shaped to engage the upper lip and the side of the neck of the bottle respectively, so that when a handle 46 , pivotally attached to the base, is lowered towards the bottle, a pair of inwardly biased jaws 64, 66 slide down over the head of the stopper to engage its undersurface between the fingers of the yoke. Thereafter, the handle is lifted extracting the stopper while inwardly facing extensions 102, 104 posi tioned above the stopper on the jaws restrict upward motion of the stopper to prevent uncontrolled motion thereof.
