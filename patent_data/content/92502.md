# Fuel control for controlling helicopter rotor turbine acceleration.

## Abstract
The difference in the speed 54, 56 of a helicopter gas engine 20 , free turbine 40 from a reference speed 62, 64 generates 80 a desired acceleration signal 81 . The dif ference 82 in actual turbine acceleration 84, 86 from desired acceleration is integrated 100 to provide an engine fuel command signal 67 73 whenever 88 the speed error signal exceeds 90 a predetermined threshold magnitude.
