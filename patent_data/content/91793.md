# BLOW MOLDING MACHINE AND METHOD

## Abstract
Disclosed are a blow molding method and machine for forming from a continuous tube of substantially unoriented normally highly crystalline thermoplastic material at its orientation temperature a chain of hollow, shaped article bodies in which the material is biaxially oriented. The machine comprises a tube and chain transporter, a tube brake, and at least one stationary blow mold. The transporter functions to pull the tube from a first point to a second point, and to push beyond the second point that portion of tne chain formed between the two points. The tube brake functions to brake the travel of the tube past the first point during at least part of the time it is being pulled, whereby the part of the tube between said points is longitudinally stretched. The stationary blow mold has at least two mold pieces that close on the stretched part of the tube, and open after formation of the hollow body in the cavity defined by the closed mold pieces. The mole also comprises means for inflating the portion of the stretched part of the tube within the mold cavity, whereby one of said bodies is formed therein, and the material thereof becomes biaxially oriented. In one embodiment of the machine, the transporter comprises tube engagement means which at a starting position grip the tube and in the forward movement of the transporter pull the tube from the first point to the second point, and push beyond the second point that portion of the chain formed between the two points, which release the tube after the stationary mold pieces have closed on the stretched portion, and which tube engagement means are returned by the transporter to the starting position during the blow molding cycle of the machine. Preferred embodiments of the machine comprise a plurality of said stationary blow molds between the first point and the second point. In one mode of operation of these embodiments the mold pieces are closed on the stretched portion of the tube at about the same time, but they are opened at different times, preferably sequentially and most preferably sequentially beginning with the blow mold closer or closest to the second point. Also, preferably these embodiments comprise chain carrier means for carrying the portion of the chain between said points upon opening of the mold pieces and pushing of that chain portion beyond the second point. The chain carrier means preferably are part of the tube and chain transporter.
