# APPARATUS FOR READING OPTICAL RECORDING CARDS.

## Abstract
An apparatus for reading optical recording cards is pro vided with a line sensor 10 for reading the information on an optical recording card 1 , in which the information is re corded in the form of a plurality of parallel tracks in an optical ly readable state on a recording medium 1A , by means of the light emitted from a light source 4 to the tracks and reflected thereon a cylindrical lens 11 supported pivotably between the optical recording card 1 and line sensor 10 and a circuit for detecting an azimuthal error occurring between the tracks and line sensor 10 . In this apparatus, the cylindrical lens 11 is turned by an output from the azimuthal error detecting circuit to correct an aximuthal error. An azimuthal error of an image of an auxiliary track on the optical recording card, which is projected on the line sensor, can thus be corrected smoothly and speedily with a high accuracy by the pivotal movement of the cylindrical lens 11 .
