# Window structure of a vehicle.

## Abstract
A window structure is used for a vehicle body 20 including upper and lower frame members 21 , right and left side pillar members 22 and corner members 23 defining a substantially rectangular window opening portion 24 . A projecting edge 26 is integrally formed with the upper and lower frame members 21 , right and left side pillar members 22 and corner members 23 . The projecting edge 26 is formed a peripheral edge of the window opening portion 24 over an entire circumference of the window opening portion 24 . An inner wall 25 is formed at an inner periphery of the peripheral edge of said window opening portion 24 . The inner wall has a groove 27 along the entire circumference of the window opening portion 24 . A glass retainer 28 is implanted in the groove 27 . With such an arrangement, a peripheral portion of a window glass 29 is pressingly clamped between the glass retainer 28 and the projecting edge 26 through a seal rubber 30 , to thereby provide sufficient rigidity and mechanical strength against various loads imposed to the structure.
