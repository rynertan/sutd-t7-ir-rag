# Automatic chemical analysis.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a conveyor system 1 for deliver ing vials 5 containing samples for analysis through an entry gate 2 and identification arrangement 3 to a series of analytical modules 4a c where a succession of tests is effected on each of the samples. Each of the analytical modules 4a c comprises a sample probe, a reagent probe, a container for reagent adjacent to the conveyor means 1 , a movable stop member 40 ar ranged to hold a vial 5 in an appropriate position adjacent to the module, means for moving the movable stop member so as to allow the vial 5 to pass from one module to the next, and means for moving the sample and reagent probes between a first position where they are ready for insertion into a vial 5 , and a second position where they are held clear of the vial 5 . The apparatus also includes synchronising means arranged to co ordinate operation of the various elements of the apparatus. In the method, the vials 5 pass sequentially through the entry gate 2 of the above apparatus at a predetermined rate, and a portion of each of the samples is extracted while the vial 5 is at an analysis station adjacent to one of the analytical modules 4a c . A portion of reagent is simultaneously extracted and is combined with the extracted sample into a single flow line. The combined reagent sample is subjected to an analytical test within the module.
