# Transparent article and process for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A transparent article consists of a transparent substrate coated with a transparent film composed of a composition made up as follows parts by weight 100 parts of an organic silicon compound 10 30 parts of a polyfunctional epoxy resin having an aromatic or aliphatic ring, and 25 800 parts of antimony oxide particles with an average particle size of 1 to 200 nm. The organic silicon compound has the general formula I R¹ In formula I R¹ and R² each stand for an alkyl group an alkenyl group, an aryl group or a hydrocarbon group having a halogen group, an epoxy group, a glycidoxy group, an amino group, a mercapto group, a methacryloxy group or a cyano group, R³ stands for an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkyl group, an acyl group or a phenyl group, and a and b are 0 or 1. Transparent articles of the invention are suitable for spectacle and camera lenses, and for other optical articles.
