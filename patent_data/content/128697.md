# Indium tin oxide sol compositions.

## Abstract
An indium tin oxide sol composition comprises 0.5 to 30 by weight of indium oxide, tin oxide in an amount of from 0.5 to 30 by weight, based on the amounts of tin, and indium, and a dispersing agent. The composition is obtained by con tacting a solution of an indium salt of an inorganic acid contain ing a tin salt of an inorganic acid with an ion exchange resin. The composition has high purity and forms excellent transpar ent conductive films.
