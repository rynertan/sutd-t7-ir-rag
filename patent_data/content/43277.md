# Driving a matrix type display device.

## Abstract
A display device 10 has a display medium 4 and matrix type scanning 2 and data 6 electrodes which are capacitively coupled with the display medium. Display cells are defined at crossing points of scanning 2 and data 6 electrodes and the display cells can provide an electro optical display effect in response to the application of a display voltage of a predetermined level. When a display effect is to be provided at a display cell defined at the crossing point of a selected data electrode Xa and a selected scanning electrode Ya, the selected scanning electrode Xa is set at a reference voltage e.g. ground the selected data electrode Xa is set at the display voltage Va, e.g. 200V , non selected scanning electrodes Yna are floated, so that capacitive coupling provides that they are set at a voltage higher than the reference voltage, and non selected data electrodes Xna are set at a non display voltage Vna, e.g. 150V which is insufficient to provide an electro optical display effect.
