# Hydriding body centered cubic phase alloys at room temperature.

## Abstract
Solid solution of niobium or tantalum and a second metal react rapidly with hydrogen under mild conditions, eliminating the need for a high temperature induction process. Suitable second metals include Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Cu, V, Si, Ge and Ga.
