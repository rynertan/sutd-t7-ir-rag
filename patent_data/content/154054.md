# HF ARRANGEMENT FOR COHERENT PULSE RADAR

## Abstract
The invention relates to a coherent radar comprising a magnetron MAG , a modulator MOD for pulsed driving if the magnetron, a stable local oscillator STALO and mixer B for producing an intermediate frequency signal of incoming echoes and an intermediate frequency oscillator MFO and phase sensitive detector D for detecting the echo pulses in order to generate a so called bipolar video signal. According to the invention a HF signal derived from the stable oscillator STALO is fed to the tuning cavities of the magnetron MAG , so called priming, at least in the transmis sion moment, and furthermore the modulator MOD and the intermediate frequency oscillator MFO are mutually time controlled in such manner that the front flank of the modulator pulse and thereby of the magnetron pulse always appears in a given phase position of the output signal from the intermediate frequency oscillator, for example a zero passage.
