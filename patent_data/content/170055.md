## Description
MOUNTING ARRANGEMENT FOR DISPLAY TERMINALBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Data display terminals include a cabinet which contains, among other things, a cathode ray tube CRT , a fan, mounting hardware, and various circuit modules which process electrical signals for display on the CRT. At the present time, one form of cabinet includes in its bottom surface a portion of a sphere, known as a spherical section, which is seated in a corresponding concave depression in a base for supporting the terminal so that it can tilt and swivel. In some assemblies, springs are included to support the cabinet during tilting to prevent the cabinet from tilting over. In other assemblies where springs are not used, the units are not balanced in all positions, which means that the units are not stable in all positions. In order to maintain stability, they rely on high frictional forces which make the units harder to tilt and swivel.In addition, excessive frictional forces cause considerable amount of wear on the contact surfaces. The present invention provides a terminal cabinet which can be tilted and swiveled without springs being required to balance it. The tilt and swivel forces are minimized to such an extent that the operator can move the unit with ease. This is achieved by placing the center of rotation of the cabinet at its center of gravity.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a side elevational view, partly in section, of a terminal embodying the invention and Fig. 2 is a plan view of a portion of the apparatus of the invention.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A data display terminal 10 embodying the invention includes a cabinet 20 containing, among other things, a cathode ray tube, hardware, various circuit boards, and wiring, all of which contribute to the mass of the terminal. The base 30 of the cabinet is provided with an integral spherical section 40 which extends downwardly therefrom, and it is supported on a pedestal 50 which has a concave recess 52 to receive the spherical section. The cabinet is coupled to the pedestal 50 by means of a support mechanism which permits the cabinet to tilt and swivel. In one arrangement, this support mechanism includes a shoe 32 in the form of a disk seated on the inner surface 36 of the spherical section and having a post or key 37 which extends downwardly therefrom through a slot 35 Fig. 2 in the spherical section, and it is secured to the pedestal by means of a screw 39. An O ring 38 is provided between the shoe 32 and the spherical section, and a second O ring 42 is provided between the spherical section and the pedestal 50. The spherical section 40 and pedestal 50 are designed and coupled together so that the cabinet can swivel and tilt on the pedestal, with the slot in the spherical section guiding the tilt. The arrangement permits swiveling through a large angle 900 and tilt 0 ing through an angle of about 25 or so. In designing the terminal so that it can be tilted safely through the desired angle without auxiliary supports such as springs or excessive frictional contact, the spherical section 40 is positioned in the base 30 so that the cabinet is always stable as it is tilted through the desired angles. According to the invention, this is accomplished by designing the center of rotation to coincide with the center of gravity.This is done by first determining, by well known computations, the center of gravity of the cabinet and its contents in X, Y, and Z directions. This point, namely, the center of gravity, provides a point location 70 in space within the cabinet, and the center of rotation of the cabinet is located at this point. Knowing the center of rotation, the radius r and the actual size of the spherical section 40 are determined by the angles through which the cabinet is to tilt and the clearance between the cabinet and the pedestal 50. The width w of the pedestal 50 is determined using the stability criteria, and the height h of the space between the base of the cabinet and the top of pedestal 50 is determined by the angle through which the cabinet is to tilt. Another factor is the location desired for the center of the terminal screen to lie above the pedestal 50, the desired distance being determined by operator comfort. Aesthetics may also be a factor in the design.
