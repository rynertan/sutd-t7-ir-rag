# Optical systems employing ovate light beams.

## Abstract
An optical system, preferably used in an optical data recorder, has a laser light source 14 emitting a light beam 19 having an ovate or elliptical cross section. An astigmatic optical element 36 , such as a hemicylinder or cylindrical lens, disposed at 45 degrees with respect to the major axis 18 , also termed the beam ellipse axis, in front of a focus detector 40 eliminates focus offset errors caused by beam ellipticity.
