# APPARATUS FOR HEATING AND MIXING HIGH VISCOSITY FLUIDS

## Abstract
An apparatus for heating a highly viscous slurry including an axially elongated hollow housing 1 through which the slurry to be heated flows and a heat exchanger 4 through which a heating fluid is passed disposed within the housing so that slurry flowing axially therethrough must pass over the heat exchanger, characterized in that the heat exchanger comprises an elongated, bulb shaped chamber 4 mounted on a rotating shaft 6 disposed coaxially within and extending through the housing. The heating fluid enters the chamber 4 through an inlet passage extending through the neck 10 of the shaft 6 and leaves the chamber 4 through an outlet passage also extending through the neck 10 of the shaft 6 . A plurality of pins 25 may be mounted to extend radially outward from the external surface of the chamber 4 to continuously stir the slurry and enhance heat exchange.
