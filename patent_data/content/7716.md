## Description
R N 2 PHENYL 2 HYDROXYETHYL 3 PHENYLPROPYL GAMINES, THEIR FORMULATIONS, USE AND PREPARATION This invention relates to novel propylamine derivatives useful in the treatment of various cardiac and circulatory disorders, pharmaceutical formulations containing those derivatives and methods of preparing the novel propylamines. Whilst numerous compounds which have inotropic properties are known, use of such compounds is severely limited due to their associated undesirable side effects or rapid inactivation in biological systems. In many cases the treatment of congestive heart failure can only be effectively accomplished with the use of older drugs such as digitalis and allied cardiac glycosides. The main pharmacodynamic activity of digitalis resides in its ability to increase the force of myocardial contraction. Digitalis is thus widely used in the treatment of cardiac failure, and is said to be presently the fourth most frequently prescribed drug in the United States of America. Whilst digitalis and its related glycosides are widely used, they remain some of the most dangerous drugs employed.All digitalis type preparaticns are toxic at high doses. Digitalis toxicity in the heart can be lethal, most of digitalis poisoning being due te the cumulative effect of maintenance doses taken over a relatively long period of time, or from use cf a large dose in the treatment of severe arrhythmias. Certain catecholamines recently have been found to exert a positive inotrople effect on heart muscle without the detrimental side effect of si nificant increase in heart rate. U.S. Patent No.3,987,200 discloses a method of increasing cardiac contractility utilizing compounds such as dl 3, 4 dihydroxy N 3 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 methyl n propyll ss phenethylamine hydrochloride, now generically referred to as dobutamine. Dobutamine is well suited for treating myocardial infarction with failure, congestive heart failure, cardiac by pass surgery and traumatic surgery. However, like most other catechol derivatives, it is rapidly inactivated in biological systems by the action of catecholO methyl transferase. Dobutamine and its related drugs are thus restricted to intravenous infusion in hospitalized patients and do not lend themselves to maintenance therapy and the prophylactic treatment of heart failure. The present invention provides a select group of phenethanolamine type compounds which are uniquely inotropic, cause minimal undesired side effects, are not rapidly inactivated in biological systems, and are orally effective. The compounds are thus ideally suited for the treatment and maintenance of conditions of depressed cardiac contractility, and can be used prophylactically in patients suffering from heart failure. According to the present invention there are provided compounds of formula I EMI3.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or fluorine Ri is hydrogen or hydroxy provided that 2 provided at least one of R1 or R2 is hydrogen R3 is hydroxy C is an asymmetric carbon atom having the R absolute stereochemical configuration and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred compounds of this invention are those of the above formula wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2 is hydroxy. This invention additionally provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound of the above formula associated with a pharmaceuticallyacceptable carrier therefor. The compounds of formula I , or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be used in the treatment of conditions of depressed cardiac contractility. The compounds of the invention can also be used to physically condition a biological system. A subject receiving such conditioning can experience the beneficial effects of physical exercise by the administration of an effective dose of a compound of this invention and thereby obviate the actual physical work otherwise required. The compounds of formula I will be named systematically herein as N substituted 3 phenylpropylamines. For example, a compound having the above formula wherein R1 is fluorine, R2 is hydrogen and R3 is a para hydroxy group will be named herein as N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine. As noted inthe above formula I , the compounds provided have one asymmetric carbon atom, designated in the formula as C . This invention comprehends those compounds having the above formula wherein the asymmetric carbon atom has the R absolute stereochemical configuration. A complete discussion of absolute stereo chemical configuration and nomenclature is presented by Cahn et al. in Experientia,Vol. XII, pp. 81 124 1956 . The stereochemical designation of the asymmetric center in the compounds of this invention will be recited first when naming the compounds, and accordingly, the compound hereinabove named is more accurately designated R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine. The compounds provided by this invention can be prepared by any of a number of methods commonly employed in synthetic organic chemistry. A typical process for preparing compounds of this invention comprises reacting an optically active mandelic acid or mandelic acid derivative with a 3 phenylpropylamine to form an amide, and then reducing the amide. For instance, 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine can be acylated with a hydroxy protected mandelic acid halide such as R 2 2fluorophenyl 2 acetoxyacetyl chloride to provide, after hydrolysis of the hydroxy protecting group, the corresponding amide, namely R N 2 2 fluoro phenyl 2 hydroxy l oxoethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine. Such acylation reactions generally are accomplished by reacting about equimolar quantities of an acid halide or other activated acylating agent and a phenylpropylamine. The acylation is carried out in an organic solvent such as benzene, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, or the like, and a base such as pyridine or triethylamine can be incorporated to act as an acid scavenger. The acylation typically is complete in about 6 to 36 hours, and the amide can be isolated simply by evaporation of the reaction solvent. The amide intermediate thus mentioned can alternatively be prepared by simply coupling a mandelic acid with a phenylpropylamine utilizing any of the known peptide coupling agents. Such agents include N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole, N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy 1,2 dihydroquinoline and the like. For instance, a mandelic acid such as R mandelic acid can be stirred with about equimolar quantities of a phenylpropylamine such as 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylamine and a cou pling agent such as N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy1,2 dihydroquinoline. The coupling reactions are best conducted in solvents such as benzene, dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, or the like, and accelerators such as l hydroxybenzotriazole can be incorporated if desired.The reaction typically is complete within about 2 to about 48 hours when carried out at a temperature of about 300C. to about 1500C. The product amide is isolated by simply filtering the reaction mixture and washing it with acid and base, and then evaporating the reaction solvent. The amide which thus is produced next is reduced to provide a compound of this invention.Reduction of an amide carbonyl can be accomplished by routine methods, for instance by reaction of the amide with diborane or other suitable reducing agent. Such reduction normally is carried out in an ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, and generally is complete in about 6 t about 72 hours when carried out from about OOC. to about 600C. For example, an amide such as R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxy 1 oxo ethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine can be reacted with excess diborane in tetrahydrofuran for about 30 hours at 500C. to effect complete reduction of the amide carbonyl group. Any excess diborane remaining in the reaction mixture can be decomposed by diluting the reaction mixture with an alcohol such as methanol or with water.Removal of the reaction solvent then provides the optically active amine of this invention, which can be further purified if desired by normal methods, including chromatography, crystallization, acid addition, salt formation and the like. Such a process will normally proceed via a protected amine of formula II EMI7.1 wherein R1 is a previously defined, R4 and R5 are identical with R2 and R3 or can independently represent OQ, where 0 represents a protecting group, preferably benzyl, the protecting groups being hydrogenolyzed off using conventional reagents known to effect such a process, for example by catalytic hydrogenation at a temperature from 15 to llO C. in a polar organic solvent for example methanol. The compounds of formula II are novel and are provided in one aspect of the invention. Still another synthetic procedure for preparing the compounds of this invention comprises reacting a phenylpropylamine such as 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylamine with a benzoyl methyl halide such as 2 fluorobenzoylmethyl bromide. The alkylation affords the corresponding N benzolmethyl phenylpropylamine, for example, N 2 fluorobenzoylmethyl 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylamine. The benzoyl carbonyl group next is reduced to provide a compound of this invention. Such reduction can be accomplished by reaction with any of a number of common reducing agents, including hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium on carbon or Raney nickel. Such reduction clearly gives a mixture of optical isomers and separation of such optical isomers can be achieved by routine methods including chromatography and resolution.Alternatively, the mixture of such optical isomers can be utilized as such according to this invention since the S isomers of compounds having the above formula are substantially devoid of biological activity. The amide which is reduced may be represented by the structural formula III EMI8.1 where R1, R2 and R3 are as defined previously.These compounds of formula III are novel and are provided in a further aspect of the invention. A preferred group of compounds provided by this invention are those having the above general formula in which both of the phenyl rings bear a hydroxyl group. When preparing such compounds it may be desirable to derivatize the hydroxyl groups so as to protect them during chemical reactions, thus avoiding any interference which might be caused by free hydroxyl groups. Phenolic as well as alkyl hydroxyl groups can be protected with any of a number of commonly used hydroxyl protecting groups.The use of such groups is described in detail by E.Haslam in Protective Groups In Organic Chemistry,J.F.W. McOmie, Ed., Plenum Press, New York, N.Y.1973, Chapter 3. Examples of commonly used protecting groups include ether forming groups such as benzyl, methyl, methoxymethyl, trimethylsilyl ester forming groups such as acetate, benzoate, 2,2dichloroacetate, 2,2,2 trichloroacetate, phenylsulfonate, and related groups. A typical example of the preparation of a compound of this invention wherein both R2 and R3 are hydroxy and suitable protecting groups are utilized involves as a first step the preparation of the protected reactants. For instance, R parahydroxymandelic acid can be protected by reaction with benzyl chloride to provide R 2 4 benzyloxyphenyl 2 hydroxyacetic acid. The 2 hydroxy group also can be protected if desired, for instance by reaction with dichloroacetyl chloride or other suitable protecting group, thus providing, as an example, R 2 4 benzyloxyphenyl 2 dichloroacetoxy acetic acid. Such protected mandelic acid derivative is coupled to a suitably protected phenylpropylamine, for instance 3 4 benzyloxyphenyl propylamine or N benzyl 3 4 benzyloxyphenyl propylamine.The amide which is produced next is reduced as hereinabove described to provide, in the instant case, a multiply protected amine. Pro tecting groups such as 2,2 dichloroacetyl readily are removed by reaction with a base such as 5 N sodium hydroxide, and protecting groups such as benzyl generally are removed by hydrogenation in the presence of catalysts such as Raney nickel. Since the compounds of this invention are amines they are basic in nature by virtue of the amino group. As such, the compounds are capable of forming salts with any of a number of inorganic and organic acids. An additional embodiment of this invention encompasses the pharmaceutically acceptable salts formed by reaction of the amines of the above general formula with acids. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to those amine acid addition salts which can be utilized in a biological system without imparting undesirable side effects attributable to the particular acid utilized to form the salt. While the identity of the particular acid used to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt is not critical, the salt which is formed utilizing such acid must be pharmaceutically acceptable. Acids commonly utilized to form salts according to this invention include mineral acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulfuric, perchloric, nitric, and related acids. Routinely used organic acids include acetic, butyric, citric, maleic, succinic, fumaric, lactic, methanesulfonic, p toluenesulfonic, and similar organic acids. Like most amine salts, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts comprehended by this invention are characteristically highly crystalline solids, and thus lend themselves to ready purification by recrystallization from common solvents such as ethanol, methanol, acetone, water, and the like. As will be described more fully hereinbelow, the salts of this invention are often preferred over the free amine bases as medicaments since they are easily formulated for convenient oral or parenteral administration. It will of course be recognized that an acid addition salt of this invention can readily be converted to the corresponding free amine simply by reaction with a base such as aqueous sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Exemplary of the compounds contemplated by this invention are the following R N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylamine R N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine R N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium chloride R N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium acetate R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyli 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylamine R N 2 2 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium bromide R N 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylamine R N 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylamine R N 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium para toluenesulfonate R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylamine R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 3 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium isobutyrate and R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxye thy 1 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium oxalate. As already pointed out, pharmaceutical formulations containing one or more compounds of this invention in combination with a suitable pharmaceutical diluent or carried therefor are provided as a further embodiment of the invention.Such formulations are useful in the treatment of heart failures due to conditions of depressed cardiac contractility and can also be used to physically condition a subject who cannot or will not physically condition by exercising. The compounds of this invention can be formulated by any of a number of commonly used methods for convenient administration orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, dermally, sublingually, rectally, via aerosols, buccal seals, and the like. A phenethanolamine of the invention, as the free base or acid addition salt, can be admixed with commonly used diluents and carriers, including starch powder, sucrose, dextrose, cellulose fiber, sorbitol, mannitol, liquid paraffin, calcium silicate, silica, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cocoa butter, methyl cellulose, methyl hydroxybenzoate, ethyl lactate, sorbitan trioleate and related excipients and carriers. The formulations of this invention can additionally contain more than one active ingredient of this invention, as well as the pharmacologically less inotropically active S isomers.The formulations normally will contain from about 1 to about 30 percent by weight of active ingredient. The formulated phenethanolamines can be encapsulated by an ingestible carrier in the form of a capsule, sachet, cachet, buccal seal, or the like, thus providing for convenient oral administration.Alternatively the formulations can be molded into tablets in unit dosage form. For intravenous administration, the formulated phenethanolamines are best dissolved in a suitable solvent such as isotonic saline or glucose or sterile water. An additional aspect of this invention includes a method of treating heart failure due to conditions of depressed cardiac contractility.According to such method of treatment, a dose effective for increasing cardiac contractility is administered to a subject suffering from heart failure due to a condition of depressed cardiac contractility and inadequate ventricular function or inadequate pumping function or to a subject sus pected of developing heart failure due to conditions of inadequate cardiac pumping function. The compounds can be formulated for convenient oral, topical, rectal or parenteral administration, and typically are administered in the form of a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The particular route of administration will vary according to the particular condition and subject to be treated.In cases of severe heart failure due to acutely depressed cardiac contractility, it may be desirable to administer a phenethanolamine of this invention intravenously until the pumping function is improved, at which time the patient can be maintained by intramuscular or oral administration. Additionally, the compounds of this invention can be formulated for administration via buccal seals, by sublingual lozenges, by rectal suppositories, by metered aerosols and by dermal application.These latter named routes of administration are particularly preferred in the prophylactic treatment of inadequate ventricular function for which the compounds of this invention are well suited. For intravenous administration according to the method of treatment of this invention, an optically active phenethanolamine of the above general formula is administered at the rate of about 0.01 to about 10 mcg. kg. min. until the contractile force of the heart muscle is restored. The infusion at such rate is continued until the subject shows signs of relief, at which time the rate of infusion can be decreased. Maintenance therapy can be accomplished if desired by the intramuscular injection of a compound of this invention in the amount of from about 10 to about 50 mcg. kg. of body weight at intervals of from about one to four times per day, or as required by the severity of the cardiac condition being treated as well as the tolerance displayed by the patient. Maintenance therapy also is conveniently accomplished by oral administration of capsules containing sufficient quantity of a compound of this invention so that the effective dose is from about 5 to about 200 mcg. kg. of body weight. Since the acid addition salts of the phenethanolamine bases of the above formula are characteristically highly soluble in water, it is preferred that oral administration is carried out utilizing formulations containing a phenethanolamine in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. For example, a particularly preferred method of treatment according to this invention comprises administering a dose effective for increasing the pumping force of a heart muscle of R N 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium chloride. Such compound is ideally administered orally, sublingually, rectally or dermally at a dose of from about 20 to about 150 mcg. kg. to a subject suffering from heart failure, or prophylactically to a subject suspected of developing heart failure due to conditions of inadequate heart pumping function. The compounds provided by this invention have been evaluated for their inotropic potency in anesthetized dogs and in conscious dogs with implanted cardiovascular transducers. The heart rate, cardiac output, systolic pressure and the derivative of the left ventricular pressure, which is the index of cardiac contractility, were measured. The compounds provided by this invention proved to be strongly inotropic, direct acting with immediate onset and adequate duration of action, and have displayed no alpha receptor activity. That the compounds of this invention are potent inotropic agents is demonstrated by the biological data presented in Table I. Column 1 lists the compounds evaluated according to the test. Each of the compounds evaluated was administered intravenously to four dogs with induced myocardial infarction. Column 2 records the contractile potency of each compound as the dose in mcg. kg. of body weight required to effect a fifty percent increase in contractility ED50 . Column 3 presents the increase in heart rate observed at the ED50 dose. Column 4 records the change in blood pressure attributable to the administered drug.

It is now widely recognized that physical training benefits people with occlusive peripheral or coronary artery disease.The result of such physical exercising is that skeletal muscle adapts in such a way that it can make better use of available blood flow. From the physiological standpoint, physical training causes an increase in the number or size, or both, of mitochondria, thereby enhancing the ability of skeletal muscle to utilize oxygen. This in turn permits the muscle to do more work on the same or lesser amount of blood flow. Therefore, a restriction of blood flow caused by a diseased artery supplying the skeletal muscle becomes less of a handicap. Moreover, since less blood flow is required by skeletal muscle, the demands on the heart are decreased so that the heart s need for blood flow is also reduced. Additionally, a restriction of blood flow caused by obstructive coronary artery disease in the heart becomes less of a handicap. A further benefit occuring with physical training is a decrease in heart rate when the body is under stress from exercise. Heart rate determines the number of times per minute that the heart develops blood pressure, and naturally a decrease in heart rate lowers cardiac blood flow. This is not a problem, however, since the training also decreases the requirement of peripheral tissue for blood flow, thus reducing cardiac output requirements. Surprisingly, the compounds provided by this invention cause the same effects observed with physical training, namely increased oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle, reduced cardiac blood flow requirements, as well as significant reduction in heart rate during exercise, a reduction in cardiac work and coronary blood flow.The compounds provided herein thus represent a significant advance in the art, since many of the people who need physical training the most are unable to exercise because of physical handicaps, arthritis, or peripheral vascular disease or existing heart disease such that exercise may either precipitate or exacerbate symptoms of heart failure. By chronic treatment with a compound of this invention, the effects of physical conditioning can be realized without the physical exertion, thus resulting in an increased efficiency for the entire cardiovascular system. A further aspect of this invention therefore is a method for physically conditioning a subject, i.e. a method for increasing oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle, by administering an effective dose of a phenethanolamine of this invention. According to such method, a compound of this invention is administered to a subject at a dose of about 5 mcg. kg. to about 200 mcg.Ag. Preferably, the compound is initially administered at a relatively low dose, for instance from about 5 to about 10 mcg. kg., at intervals of once or twice each day for about one or two weeks. The effective dose then is increased to a dose of about 10 to about 20 mcg. kg. once or twice each day for about one or two weeks. The drug dose is then again increased at regular intervals until the maximum degree of physical conditioning is experienced without an adverse increase in heart rate.For example, such dose build up procedure can be carried out by administering effective amounts of a compound such asR N 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium bromide. Such administration is preferably carried out orally at an initial dose of about 10 mcg. kg. Alternatively, such compound can be administered dermally in the form of a cream at an initial dose of about 15 to about 20 mcg. kg. The dosage, by whichever route selected, is gradually increased until the desired degree of conditioning of the biological system is established. The oral administration of a compound such as R N 2 phenyl2 hydroxyethyl 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propylaminium bromide may reach, for instance, an upper limit of about 60 to about 80 mcg. kg. given about once or twice each day. Such dosage will be continued as needed to maintain the desired effects of physical conditioning.Such maintenance therapy may be accomplished by the administration of the drug in the amount of about 60 to about 80 mcg. kg. from about one to three times per week as required. The following detailed Examples illustrate the preparation and use of certain compounds comprehended by this invention. The Examples are not intended to include all aspects of the invention and should not be so construed.
