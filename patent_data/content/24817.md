# Single facer for corrugated board.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a single facer for corrugated board of the kind comprising upper and lower corrugating rolls 1, 2 having meshing flutes, and a pressure member 3 disposed close to the lower roll 2 to provide an opposed pressure surface in conformity with the rotational surface of said lower roll, said pressure surface having a length, in the circumferential direction of the lower roll, greater than the distance â„“ between two adjacent flutes of said roll. An object of the invention is to reduce friction between the pressure web and a linear web 5 fed thereacross. The invention is characterised in that an endless belt 11 is provided and is arranged such that one run of the belt is inserted between the pressure surface 14 of the pressure member 10a and the liner web 5, said endless belt rotating during pressing together and pasting of the liner web and a corrugated web 6 carried on the lower roll 2 to reduce friction forces. Preferably, the endless belt 11 passes around spaced pulleys 13 arranged on opposite sides of the pressure member 10a and the belt is driven by a motor at the same peripheral rotational speed as that of the lower roll 2.
