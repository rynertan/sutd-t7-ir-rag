# Optical information recording medium for semiconductor laser.

## Abstract
An optical recording medium is disclosed which allows information to be recorded thereinto and read thereoutof by means of semiconductor laser light. The recording medium comprises at least a substrate and a recording layer formed on one or both sides of the substrate. Information is recorded into and read from the recording layer by laser light. The recording layer comprises an organic film of a naphtho quinonoid dye corresponding to the following molecular formula or an organic film whose major component is the naphthoquinonoid dye
