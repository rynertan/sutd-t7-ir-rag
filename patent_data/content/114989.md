# Thermal printerand thermal printingmethod.

## Abstract
A thermal printer includes a CPU 2 which reads out a corresponding character data from an ROM 4 in accordance with a character specifying data from a host computer 8 and selectively allows currents to flow through thermal resistors 22 1 to 22 N of a thermal head 22 in accordance with the bit dot pattern data which constitutes the readout character data. A size data representative of the size of the picture element of the character to be printed is further generated from the host computer 8 . The CPU 2 converts the n bit dot pattern data into the dot pattern data of the number of bits designated by the size data and selectively allows the currents to flow through the thermal resistors 22 1 to 22 N in accordance with this converted dot pattern data.
