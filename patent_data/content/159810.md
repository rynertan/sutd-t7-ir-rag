# Broadband digital transmission systems.

## Abstract
A broadband digital transmission system enables high bit rate data stream to be transmissed over low bit rate telephone networks. A high bit rate stream of data from a source 2 is distributed by a distributor 4 into six separate streams to provide six low bit rate streams of data. A call unbit 6 establishes six channel communication with a receiver 20 and the six data streams are fed in parallel along the six channels. A reassembler 34 receives the six low bit rate streams and reconstructs them to produce the original high bit rate stream of data.
