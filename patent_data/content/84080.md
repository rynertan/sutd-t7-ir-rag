# Draw off and hold back cable tension machine.

## Abstract
An improved cable tension machine increases the velocity for hauling in of cable from approximately 100 feet per minute to an excess of 700 feet per minute. The cable tension machine uses a floating, semirigid track suspension to hold the track belts in contact with the cable. The track suspension increases the minor variation tolerance accept able for the cable tension machine, thereby allowing rapid running of odd shapes through the cable tension machine. A more uniform cable loading force is provided to the cable without excessive force when bodies are encountered and without jamming. Basically, the cable tension machine comprises upper and lower track assemblies positioned atop one another capable of applying a tensioning force to the cable which passes between the track assemblies. A housing holds both track assemblies in spaced relationship, allowing movement of the upper track assembly relative to the lower track assembly through a pivotable lift point on the upper part of the housing. The lift point is located to optimize performance. The housing is open on one side to allow threading of a cable between the track belt.
