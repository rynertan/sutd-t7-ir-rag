# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, in which an epitaxial layer doped with Mg is deposited on a semiconductor body.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, in which an epitaxial layer 21, 31 doped with magnesium of elements from the groups III and V of the periodic system of elements is deposited on a surface of a semiconductor body 20, 30 . For this purpose, the semiconductor body is brought into contact with a saturated seolution of the compound, in which magnesium is present. Magnesium is added to the solution in the form of magnesium silicide, magnesium germanide or magnesium stannide. Thus, the epitaxial layer can be doped in a very reproducible manner, whilst moreov er defects in the layer due to magnesium oxide particles are prevented.
