## Description
Device for prcssing curd to form cheese. The invention relates to a device for pressing curd to form cheese, provided witli a number of cheese vats and compressing plungers, a vertically movable actuating member for said plungers, spring members between the actuattng member and each plunger and a means for each plunger for limiting the movement of tite plunger with resnect to said actuating member, such thit the spring means are mechanically biased.Such a device is known the United States Patent Specification 4.045.152 to H.J. Peterson et al.In this non device the plungers are each connected to a central rod having a cotter pin to restrict the distance between the plunger and the actuating member, a coil spring surrounding the central rod. Said coil spring is such dimensioned that it is compressed somewhat when no force is exerted on the plunger. When the plunger is pressed down it can nove towards the actuation member over a distance wiiich in practice is only limited vhen the turns ol the coil spring engage each other.Further the central rod is only guided over a rather small distance at the side of the ac,,uatiol member, so that it is difficult to obtain an exact location of the plunger. Coil springs exert apart from an axial thrust in many cases also a tilting momentum. Finally the bias of the springs is obtained by mcans of said cotter pins, which is normally a construction of limited robust ess. The invention aii is to improve the known device in the above indicated respects. Further with the known device the final height of the pressed curd or the cheese is not really limit d by the plungers and their actuation because the springs can yield almost unlimited. For that reason it is desired to limit the yiclding of the plungers.The invention provides a robust and reliable construction allowing for a high degree of uniformity of the cheese made, which have little height differonces and practically no obliqueness ol the upper surfaces. Aecordingythe invention provides that the actuating member is provided with downwardly extending first legs for each plunger, that each plunger is provided with upwardly extending second legs and that in the first or the second legs a vertically extending slit is present, wherewith the second or first legs respectively are provided with a pin protruding through said slits.A further elaboration of the invention giving an even better stability provides that for each plunger two brackets each having two downwardly extending legs are provided, a horizontal pill being 1 mounted in the le s of each bracket arid said plunger being provided with two vertical walls adjacent said legs, which walls serve the purpose of the second legs a M are provided with two vertical slits through each of which a pin protrudes, mounted in one of said brackcts.With the invention the spring neans preferably consist of dish springs, bccause such springs give an axial thrust without tilting momentum.In a device of the type of the invention pressing of curd nor occurs according to a predetermined time force function. In order to obtain a well closed cheese rind it is, when using the invention, to be preferred to bias the spring means in such a way that they will yield in case of an equable load of the plungers before the maximum pressing force is exerted on said actuating member.for many European cheeses the maximum pressure to be exerted on the curd is ill the region of 300 400 g cm2, so that tile bis of t ie spring means has to be such that they yield at lower pressures but still can be compressed somewhat when the maximum pressure occurs. Adaption is easily possible by adding or removing one or w few dish spring member. The invention in the following is elucidated on hand of the drawing in which Figure 1 shows schematically a front view of a cheese press according the invention,Figure 2 shows a detail on a larger scale, partly in cross sectio i andFigure 3 shows a cross section over the line III III of figure 2.In figure 1 a number of cheese vats 1 is indicated which are positioned in a row. A press contains for instance three such rows. ach of the vats cooperates with a plunger 2, provided with vertically upright members 3 in which slits 4 are present.The members 3 are connected to each other by a board 5.A ulate shaped press member 6, that for pressing cheeses is actuated with a predetermined programmed vertical force, which ror instance is generated pneumatically, is provided with pairs of brackets 7. in each bracket 7 a pin O is mounted protruding through slits 4. On the board 5 a dish spring 9 rests, which at its upper side engages plate member 6.In figures 2 and 3 the same parts are indicated with the same references and some further details are shown which in the following will be elucidated. As is visible in figure 2 and z tic. planter 2 is provided with drain openings 10 and a drain plate 11. As is shown rlso the dish spring 9 is guided by a pin 12, which protrudes into cylindrical recesses 13 and 14 in the board 5 and the press member 6 respectively. In figures 2 and 3 the case is shown in which the spring 9 is compressed maximally. The length of the slits 4 is such that when the pin 8 is located at the lower side of the slits 4 the force exerted by spring 9 still is in the region that is acceptable for a good rind forming.
