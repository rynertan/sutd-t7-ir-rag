# Tool radius compensation system.

## Abstract
A system in which the radius r of a tool TL is compen sated for in the three dimensional machining of a workpiece WK , wherein a tool TL is offset from a commanded tool path TP2 by a distance commensurate with the tool radius r . Machining is performed by commanding the contour of the workpiece as a tool path TP2 in a prescribed plane sectioning the workpiece WK , providing the value of the tool radius r and the angle of inclination 90 0 of a machined surface WSF of the workpiece WK , computing a first tool offset quantity in a direction at right angles to the prescribed plane, based on the radius r of the tool TL and the angle of inclination 90 0 , compensating for the radius r of the tool TL in the prescribed planed based on the first tool offset quantity, correcting the position of the tool TL in a direction at right angles to the prescribed plane based on the second tool offset quantity, and machining the workpiece WK in three dimensions based on the compensated tool radius in the prescribed plane and the corrected tool position in the direction at right angles to the prescribed plane.
