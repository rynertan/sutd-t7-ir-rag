## Description
5 AMINO OR SUBSTITUTED AMINO IMIDAZOLES This invention relates to anticoccidial compounds and their preparation. Coccidiosis is a widespread poultry disease produced by infections of protozoa of the genus Eimeria, which causes severe pathology in the intestines and caeca of poultry. Some of the most significant of these species are E. tenella, E. acervulina, E. necatrix, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E.mitis, E, mivati, E. hagani and E. praecox. The disease is generally spread by the birds picking up the infectious organism in droppings on contaminated litter or ground or by way of food or drinking water. The disease is manifested by haemorrhage, accumulation of blood in the caeca, passage of blood to the droppings, weakness and digestive disturbances. The disease often terminates in death but the market value of fowl that survive severe infections is substantially reduced as a result. Coccidiosis is therefore a disease of great economic importance and extensive work has been done to find new and improved methods for controlling and treating coccidial infections in poultry. This invention is based on the discovery that certain novel 5 amino and substituted amino imidazoles and certain of their substituted derivatives have a surprisingly and unexpectedly high degree of activity against coccidiosis of poultry. The present invention provides a compound having the formula EMI2.1 in which R1 is a mono substituted phenyl or mono substituted phenalkyl where the substituent is trifluoromethyl, C2 3 alkanoyl, nitro, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, acetamido, C1 3 alkylthio, C1 3 alkylsulfinyl, C1 3 alkylsulfonyl orEMI2.2 where n is from 1 to 5, R5 is as defined below and X is O, S, SO, SO2, CH2,CO, CHOH, CHCN or C NR6 where R6 is hydrogen, C1 3 alkyl, hydroxy,C1 3 alkoxy, amino, C13 alkylamino, or di C1 3 alkyl amino b phenyl or phenalkyl having from two to five R5 substituents where each R5, independently of the other s , is halogen, cyano, trifluoromethyl, C2 3 alkanoyl, nitro, C1 3 alkyl, C1 3 alkoxy, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, trifluoromethoxy, acetamido, C1 3 alkylthio, C1 3 alkylsulfinyl, C1 3 alkylsulfonyl, trichi orovinyl, trifi uorom ethylthio, trifluorom ethylsiilfiiryl trifluoromethylsulfonyl orEMI3.1 where R5, X, and n are as defined above, provided that if the monosubstituent or one of the polysubstituents is halogen, C1 3 alkyl orC1 3 alkoxy, such atoms or groups are in positions other than those ortho to the positions of attachment of the phenyl to the imidazole or the alkyl that is in turn attached to the imidazole or c phenacyl, pyridyl, pyridylmethyl, naphthyl, naphthylmethyl, quinolyl, or quinolylmethyl R2 is amino, C1 3 alkylamino, di Cl 3 alkyl amino, acetamido, acetimido, ureido, formamido, formimido or guanidino R3 is carbamoyl, cyano, carbazoyl, amidino or NThydroxycarbamoyl and R4 is hydrogen, C1 3 alkyl, hydroxy, amino, C1 3 alkylamino, di Cl 3 alkyl amino, phenyl, cyano, C13 alkoxy, C2 3 alkanoyloxy, C13 alkylthio, C1 3 alkylsulfinyl, or C13 alkylsulfonyl.Preferably, when a given R5 is defined so as to include a second R5 group, then that second R5 group cannot itself be defined so as to include a third R5 group. Administration of a small amount of at least one of the compounds of the invention, preferably in a composition with an inert carrier, conveniently a poultry feed, can be effective in preventing or greatly reducing the incidence of coccidiosis. Such compositions are another aspect of the present invention. The compounds are effective against both the caecal form caused principally by E. tenella and the intestinal forms principally caused by E. acervulina, E. brunetti, E. maxima and E. necatrix .The coccidiostats of this invention are particularly effective against the species that cause caecal damage in addition to preventing the pathology caused by the coccidia. These compounds also exert an inhibitory effect on the oocysts by greatly reducing the number and or the sporulation of those produced. They are administered in compositions that also include an inert carrier. The compounds of the invention are also active against Eimeria spp, in other animals. The novel imidazole derivatives of this invention are prepared by reacting an appropriately substituted halide and a l unsubstituted imidazole compound in the presence of a base in a suitable reaction medium. The preferred compounds of the invention are those in which, in the foregoing structural formula, R1 is monosubstituted phenyl or monosubstituted benzyl where the substituent is a trifluoromethyl, phenoxy, benzoyl, phenylthio, phenylsulfinyl or phenylsulfonyl radical or a halosubstituted, methyl substituted or trifluoromethyl substituted phenoxy, phenylthio, phenylsulfinyl, phenylsulfonyl, benzoyl or phenylhydroxymethyl radical a di or trisubstituted phenyl or benzyl radical where the substituents are halogen, cyano, methyl, trifluoromethyl, phenoxy, benzoyl, phenylthio, phenylsulfinyl, phenylsulfonyl, or a halo substituted, methylsubstituted or triflu.oromethyl substituted phenoxy, phenylthio, phenylsulfinyl, phenylsulfonyl, benzoyl or phenylhydroxymethyl radical provided that if the monosubstituent or one of the substituents is halogen, it is ortho to the position of attachment of the phenyl to the imidazole or to the methyl that is in turn attached to the imidazole R2 is amino, lower alkylamino or di loweralkyl amino R3 is carbamoyl and R4 is hydrogen. The especially preferred compounds of the invention are those in which R1 is a phenyl or benzyl radical having 2 or 3 halo, cyano, methyl, trifi uoromethyl, halophenoxy, tolyoxy, trifl uoromethylphenoxy, halophenylthio, tolylthio, trifluoromethylphenylthio, halophenylsulfinyl, tolysulfinyl, trifluoromethyl phenylsulfinyl, halophenylsulfonyl, tolylsulfonyl, trifluoromethylphenylsulfonyl, halobenzoyl, methylbenzoyl, trifluoromethylbenzoyl, halophenyl hydroxymethyl, methylphenylhydroxym ethyl and or trifl uorom ethyl phenyl hydroxym ethyl substituents in the meta and or para positions R2 is amino R3 is carbamoyl and R4 is hydrogen. In the present specification and claims the term loweralkyl means Cl 3 alkyl , viz. methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl the term loweralkoxy means Cl 3 alkoxy, viz. methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, or isopropoxy and the term lower alkanoyltt means C2 3 alkanoyl, viz. acetyl and propionyl. The compounds of the invention may be prepared by any one of several processes. The most general process is outliried in the following reaction scheme. Reaction Scheme IEMI7.1 where X is a halogen preferably chlorine or bromine. In the foregoing reaction a l unsubstituted but otherwise appropriately substituted imidazole is reacted with a halogen substituted R1 group in the presence of a base to prepare the desired l substituted imidazole. The reaction is carried out in a solvent which may be any polar aprotic organic solvent such as acetone, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dioxane, and the like in the presence of a base. The base may be any non nucleophilic organic or inorganic base since its purpose is merely to neutralize the acid produced during the course of the reaction. Suitable inorganic bases are alkali metal bases, such as sodium and potassium carbonates, phosphates, bicarbonates and hydroxides.Suitable organic bases are tertiary amines such as trialkyl substituted amines and cyclic aromatic amines such as collidine. The reaction rate varies greatly with the nature of the proposed substituent at the R1 position, the base being used in the reaction and the solvent. Very reactive substituent and base combinations may be complete in as little as ten minutes and at the other extreme the reaction may take as long as two weeks. Most reactions are however complete in from 1 to 100 hours. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from room temperature to 100C pr to the reflux temperature of the solvent system being used. The products of the reaction are isolated using techniques known to those skilled in the art. An alternate procedure for preparing the imidazole compounds wherein R2 is amino and R3 is carbamoyl is outlined in the following reaction scheme Reaction Scheme 2EMI9.1 wherein R4 is hydrogen, loweralkyl, or phenyl. The above reaction is carried out in a non polar aprotic solvent system as described in the preceding reaction scheme. The reaction is carried out by first combining the aminocyanoacetamide and triethylorthoformate in the solvent and stirring at from room temperature to 1000C or to the reflux temperature of the solvent system being employed for from 10 minutes to 3 hours. Generally this phase of the reaction is complete in from 1 2 to 1 hour.However, following this reaction period the R1 substituted amine is added to the reaction mixture and the reaction stirred for up to 2 hours at from room temperature to 100C or the reflux temperature of the reaction system. The reaction is oftentimes very fast being evidenced by the immediate production of a precipitate and the product may be isolated immediately. However, generally to insure that the reaction is complete, stirring and heating are continued for a short time. The products of the reaction are isolated using techniques known to those skilled in the art. The novel compounds of this invention are orally administered to poultry for the control and prevention of coccidiosis. Any number of conventional methods are suitable for administering the coccidiostats of this invention to poultry, as for example, they may be given in the poultry feed.The actual quantity of the coccidiostats administered to the poultry in accordance with this invention will vary over a wide range and be adjusted to individual needs, depending upon species of the coccidia involved and severity of the infection. The limiting criteria are that the minimum amount is sufficient to control coccidiosis and the maximum amount is such that the coccidiostat does not result in any undesirable effects. A feed typically contains from about 0.0001 to about 0.2 percent, preferably from about 0.001 to about 0.1 percent, by weight of one of the coccidiostats of this invention. The optimum levels will naturally vary with the specific compound utilized and species of Eimeria involved, and can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. Levels of the 5 amino and substituted amino imidazoles of this invention, in poultry feed of from about 0.001 percent to about 0.1 percent by weight of the diet are especially useful in controlling the pathology associated with E. tenella, as well as the intestinal dwelling species. Depending on the compound employed, levels of 0.001 percent to 0.006 percent possess the novel effects of reducing the number of oocysts passed in the droppings. of infected chickens and or inhibiting the subsequent division and maturation to infectivity, scientifically designated as the process of sporulation. Thus, the combination of prevention of pathology, coupled with the inhibiting effect on the reproductive product of these organisms, the oocysts, present a unique two fold method for the control of coccidiosis in poultry. The quantity or concentration of a novel coccidiostat of this invention in any admixture in which it is administered to the poultry will, of course, vary in accordance with the type of admixture utilized. Of the various methods of administering the coccidiostats of this invention to poultry, they are most conveniently administered as a component of a feed composition. The novel coccidiostats may be readily dispersed by mechanically mixing the same in finely ground form with the poultry feedstuff, or with an intermediate formulation premix that is subsequently blended with other components to prepare the final poultry feedstuff that is fed to the poultry. Typical components of poultry feedstuffs include molasses, fermentation residues, corn meal, ground and rolled oats, wheat shorts and middlings, alfalfa, clover and meat scraps, together with mineral supplements such as bone meal and calcium carbonate and vitamins. The following non limiting examples will serve to further illustrate the instant invention. EXAMPLE 1Preparation of l substituted 5 aminoimidazole 4 carboxamides Method A A mixture of 5 aminoimidazole 4 carboxamide hydrochloride, potassium carbonate, alkyl halide, and acetone were refluxed together for from 3 to 168 hours, the solvent was concentrated to about 1 6 of the original volume and the mixture filtered.

The product on silica gel was placed on top of a column of 1200 mlE. Merck 7734 silica gel and eluted with 9 1 v v methylene chloride methanol. After a forerun of 1.0 1, 400 ml fractions were collected and fractions 8 11 and 12 15 were combined separately and evaporated to dryness. The solid product from fractions 8 11 was triturated with a small volume of acetone and filtered. The filtrate was combined separately with the product from fractions 12 15 and evaporated to dryness. The product was recrystallized from methanol to provide 320 mg of l m cyanobenzyl 5aminoimidazole 4 carboxamide, m.p. 246 2470C. EXAMPLE 4Preparation of 1 4 chloro 3 trifluoromethylbenzyl 5 aminoimidazole 4 carboxamide A mixture of 5 aminoimidazole 4 carboxamide hydrochloride 5.0 g , K2CO3 16.5 g , and a 9 1 w w mixture of a,4 chloro 3 trifluoromethyltoluene and a,2 dichloro 3 trifluoromethyltoluene were refluxed in acetone 300 ml for 4 days. Solvent was concentrated in vacuo, the residue was diluted with water, and the solution was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts were washed with brine, 0.5 N acetic acid, and brine, dried, treated with activated charcoal, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to provide a first crop of 3.40 g. The filtrate was diluted with ether to provide a second crop of 2.07 g, and the remaining filtrate was diluted with hexane to provide a third crop of 0.25 g.The second and third crops were combined, dissolved in aqueous ethanol, diluted with water, and concentrated to provide 0.97 g of solid. Further concentration of the filtrate provided an additional 0.43 g. The samples weighing 3.40 g, 0.97 g, and 0.43 g were combined, treated with hot 7.5 methanol in ethyl acetate, and diluted with 50 ml ethyl acetate. The resulting solution was chromatographed on a column of 500 ml silica gel, eluted with 7.5 methanol in ethyl acetate followed by 10 methanol in ethyl acetate. A total of 150 fractions of 20 ml each were collected at a flow rate of about 10 ml min. Fractions 60 118 were combined and evaporated to provide 3.53 g solid. The product was dissolved in 100 ml of boiling ethanol, treated with activated charcoal, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to provide a first crop of Crystals, and further concentration of the filtrate provided a second crop. The two crops were combined and recrystallized from 50 ml of ethanol to provide 1.99 g l 4 chloro 3 trifluoromethylbenzyl 5 amlno imidazole 4 carboxamide, m.p. 230.5 232.5 C.
