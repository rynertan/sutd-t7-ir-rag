# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO APPARATUS FOR THE CONVEYING OF PARTICULATE MATERIAL

## Abstract
Apparatus for conveying particulate material, particularly coal, which comprises a conduit through which a first air stream flows and which includes a chamber 6 having a side inlet through which material is fed continuously into the cham ber at right angles thereto by a screw conveyor 34 so that the particles become entrained in the air stream. The conduit fur ther comprises a cylindrical outlet member 16 through which the particles are conveyed by the first air stream, and a second air stream flows around the first air stream from an annular gap between the outlet member and a nozzle member 18 sur rounding the latter. The conduit is disposed at an inclination to the horizontal so that the material introduced by the screw conveyor falls into the first air stream.
