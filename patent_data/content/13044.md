## Description
L ASPARTYL AMIDE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS SWEETENING AGENTS The most widely used natural sweetener for food and similar preparations is sucrose. Sucrose is safe, naturally occurring, and has a hicjh sweetners wuality, i.e., a pure, quick onset with no aftertaste or undertaste. One drawback to the use of sucrose as a sweetener is its caloric content.Persons aTho have diabetes must carefully control their intake cf sugar to avoid problems associated with the disease. Persons who have excess eight must use nonnutritive sweeteners since the use of sucrose leads to weight gain rather than weight control or reduction. A second drawback to sucrose is that it is cariogenic and therefore cannot be used in dentifrices and is undesirable in chewing gums. A third drawback is that sucrose does not have a sufficiently high sweetness intensity for some compositions, e.g. dentifrices. If enough sucrose is used to make the composition sweet, the product becomes tacky and hygroscopic. Additionally, for the amount of sweetness delivered, sucrose is expensive. It can be appreciated that the search continues for compounds which have high sweetness intensity and quality, are non nutritive, and are safe for oral consumption. Numerous compounds have been discovered which are non nutritive sweeteners. However, most have drawbacks of one sort or another. Sodium cyclamate has been banned for oral use because it ma be carcinogenic or mutagenic.Saccharin is also being questioned as a possible carcinogen additionally, saccharin has a bitter aftertaste. Neohesperidine dihydrochalcone has 900 times the sweetness of sucrose however, the sweetness is slow to develop and there is a licorice like aftertaste. Aspartame a dipeptide, ias a high quality sweetness of approximately 150 times sucrose, but hydrolyzes in aqueous solution to its non sweet component amino acids. Other aspartic acid derivatives are sweet but hydrolyze in the gastrointes tinal tract to release ptnt vasopressors. Non nutritive sweeteners have been known for almost one hundred years saccharin, 1879 and theories have been proposed to account for the perception of sweetness and the chemical structures that produce that perception.Yet, there seems to be no common molecular property which can be used to predict either the level or, especially, the quality of sweetness. Ingenious models have been proposed to explain the sweetness of knorn compounds, but not all compounds fitting the models are sweet and the theories cannot be used to predict or construct new sweeteners. The prediction of the quality of sweetness, as well as the intensity of sweetness, appears to remain a complete mystery. The compounds of the present invention, L l hydroe methyl alkaneamide derivatives of L aspartic acid, have not previously been prepared. It has now been discovered that, surprisingly, the compounds are sweet and are phsiologicallxt safe for oral use in sweetening amounts, even though similar alkaneamide derivatives have drug activity. The compounds of the present invention do not have a labile ester linkage and so are much more stable in aqueous solution than dipeptides such as L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester. Additionally, the preferred compound disclosed herein also has a sweetness quality equivalent to sucrose while having a sweetness intensity some 50 times greater than sucrose. BACKGROUND ART Investigations into derivatives of aspartic acid as non nutritive sweeteners stem from the accidental discovery that l aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester Aspartam R is sweet, 100 150 times sucrose, and free of unpleasant aftertaste. R. H. Mazur, J. M. Schlatter, andA. H. Goldkamp, JACS, 91, 2684 1969 . The authors disclosed that the L aspartic acid portion of the mole cule is critical for sweetness, but that considerable modification of the phenylalanine portion could be tolerated. Subsequent work investigated the structural re lationships of aspartic acid amides as regards sweetness.R. H. Mazur, A. H. Goldkamp, P. A. James, and J. M.Schlatter, J. Med. Chem. 13, 12 17 1970 . The authors investigations revealed that the structural requirements for good sweetness in derivatives of L aspartic acid are quite specific, as is revealed by tests of the L aspartate amides EMI3.1 4 methylpentylamide tasteless l ethylbutylamide bitter hexylamide sweet,l 2 X sucrose heptylamide sweet,l 2 X sucrose l methylbutylamide tasteless l methylpentylamide sweet, 30 X sucrose 1 methylhexylamide sweet, 20 50 X sucrose 1 methylheptylamide sweet, 10 X sucrose 1,3 dimethylbutylamide bitter 1,3 dimethylpenthylamide sweet, 1 2 X sucrose l,4 dimethylpentylamide sweet, 50 100 X sucrose All the sweet isomers were fouled to be L L The 1methylhexylamide was about 20 50 times the sweetness of sucrose and the 1,4 dimethylpenthylamide was about 50 100 times the sweetness of sucrose. British patent 1,381,826, Neely, January 29, 1975, claims tl3e use of L aspartyl L 1,4 dimethylpentylamide in oral compositions as a sweetener. Y. Ariyoshi, N. Yasuda, K. Yamatani, Bull. Chem.Soc. Japan, 47, 326 1974 describe investigations into the sweetness of hydroxy substituted derivatives of Laspartyl dipeptides. They report that u L aspartl L l methyl 2 phencthyl2mine aspartyl amphetamine was 50 times as sweet as sucrose however, L aspartyl L 1 hydroxymethyl 2 methyl 2 phenethylamine was only 1 to 2 times as sweet as sugar. The authors report that with anL,L configuration, hydroxyl substitution always decreased potency of sweetness, while with L,D configurations, hydroxy substitution sometimes increased potency and sometimes decreased it. Methyl substitution at the 2 or 3 position produced bitter tasting compounds. l l hydroxyethyl derivatives of a L aspartic acid have no sweetness. L. B. P. Brusse, H. C. Peer, A, van der Heijden, Z. Lebensm Unters. Forsch., 159, 339 1975 . M. Miyoshi, S. Nunami, H. Sugano, T. Fujii, Bull. Obem. Soc. Japan, 51, 1433 1978 disclose L aspartyl dipeptides of the formula EMI4.1 as being sweet. The authors state that none of the 0 acyl L aspartylamino L alkanols synthesized were sweet and that the C terminal amino acid must be the D form to exhibit sweetness. Belgian Patent 851,368, Ferrer, May 5, 1977 discloses the compound alpha L aspartyl 1,5 dimethyl 5 hy droxyhexylamide claimed as the l aspartete of 6 amino 2methyl 2 heptenol for use in the treatment of cardiac and bionary insufficiency In the gastrointestinal tract, L aspartyl all anc amides and L aspartyl 1 hydroxymethyl alkaneamides are hydrolyzed to aspartic acid and the corresponding amine by aminopeptidase cnzymes. E. F. Marsh, D. A. Herring, J.Pharm. Exp. Therapy, 102 178 1951 describe a study of the comparative pharmacology of hydroxyl and methyl derivatives of 1,5 dimethylhexylamine named as 6 methyl2 heptylaminc hy the authors These compounds would be produced by the hydrolysis of the L aspartyl dimethylhexylamide. The data shoi the amine compound to have vasopressor and myocardial stimulant activity. This activity is shown to be lessened somewhat by 5 hydroxyl or 2 or 3 methyl substitution. 1,5 dimethylhexylamine has been sold commercially as a vasoconstrictor Octodrine 1,3 dimethyl pentylamine has been sold as a vasoconstrictor Forthane 1,5 dimethylaminohexan 5 ol hydrochloride has ben sold as a cardiac stimulant and coronary vasodilator eptanol . DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention encompasses compounds of the formula EMI6.1 wherein said compound is in the L, L form and wherein R1 H,EMI6.2 orEMI6.3 R2 H or CH3 R3 H or CH3 and Rê CH3, C2H5, i C3H4, or t C4H3, except that where R4 is i C3C7 or t C4H9, Rê and R are H and toxicologically acceptable salts thereof. The present invention also encompasses compositions of matter comprising an ingestible carrier, i.e., food, beverage, drug, mouthwash, dentifr ce, or other compositions designed for oral use, containing an effective sweetening amount of a compound having formula I, above. The present invention arises from the discovery that hydroxymethyl substitution at the position in theL alkaneamide moiety of L aspartyl amides of formula I, above, not only reduces the pharmacological activity of the amine portion of the amide and therefore of the amide itself but also produces intensely sweet amides. The preferred sweetener compound herein is N L aspartyl L 1 hydroxymethyl 1,4 methylpentylamide, of the formula EMI6.4 The preferred sweetener compound II is approximately 50 times as sweet as sucrose and has a sweetness quality approximately equal to sucrose. Additionally, compound II is sweet in both aqueous solution and granular form.Compound II is particularly useful as a sugar substitute for diabetics or iit conscious persons. Non nutritive sweeteners which are amide derivatives of L aspartic acid are most commonly used in the form of salts. Salts are preferred as the salts dissolve rapidly and also provide a more rapid onset of sweetness thn tile amide compound per se. Toxicoloyically acceptable salts as used herein refers to salts of the instant compounds which are physiologically acceptable for ingestion. Typical toxicologically acceptable salts of the present sweeteners are sodium, potassium, calcium, and ammonium salts as well as hydrohalide, and especially hydrochloride, addition salts. The 1 hydroxymethyl substituent group present in compounds of formula I can be in the unsubstituted alcohol form or can be esterified with lower alkyl carboxylic acids, especially formic or acetic acid. Although the ester itself may not be sufficiently sweet for all purposes, once the esterified l hydroxymethyl amide is placed in an aqueous environment, ester hydrolysis will begin to occur to produce the preferred, sweet aspartyl 1 hydroxymethyl substituted amide. The L aspartyl L l hydroxymethyl alkaneamides of the invention are useful for sweetening a variety of food products such as fruits, vegetables, juices, meat products such as ham or bacon, sweetened milk products, egg products, salad dressings, ice creams and sherbets, gelatins, icings, syrups, cake mixes and frostings, as well as for sweetening beverages such as carbonated soft drinks and wines. The compounds of the invention can also be used to sweeten dentifrices, mouthwashes, and chewing gums, as well as drugs such as liquid cough remedies. The instant sweetening agents are stable substances and can be used in a variety or physical form. , e. g., as powders, tablets, syrups, pastes, solutions, etc. Liquid or solid carriers such as water, qlycero, starch, sorbitol, salt, citric acid and other suitable nontoxic substances can also be ut ed as carriers. The sweetening agents can readily be used in pharmaceutical compositions to impart a sweet taste. The sweetening agents are used in effective sweetening amounts. By effective sweetening amounts as used herein is meant sufficient sweetenillg agent to provide a sweet taste of the desired intensity for the orally ingested composition. The amount added will generally depend upon commercial needs as well as individual sweetness sensitivity. Representative sweetener compounds of formula I include N a L aspartyl L amide derivatives wherein the Lamide moiety is 1 hydroxymethyl 4,4 dimethylpenthylamide 1 hydroxymethyl 5 methylhexylamide l hydroxymethylhexylamide 1 hydroxymethyl 4 methylhexylamide 1 hydroxymethyl 4,4 dimethylhexylamide l hydroxmethylpentylamide 1 hydroxymethyl 5,5 dimethylhexylamideSome of the above compounds1 although sweet, are not as preferred as the L 1 hydroxymethyl 4 methylpentylamide by reason of solubility or sweetness quality. For example, the aspartyl L 1 hydroxymethyl 5 methylhexylamide is somewhat slow to dissolve. The aspartyl L l hydroxymethyl 4,4dimethylpentylamide, is sweet in both granular form and in aqueous solution, but has somewhat of a melon like undertaste The synthesis of the compounds of formula I is a multi step process. In gencral, the compounds can be made through either of two generalized synthetic procedures, A and B, below both involving an enzymic optical isomer resolution step and both of which, although time consuming, involve only standard organic synthesis techniques Procedure A Step 1 Using standard techniques, the appropriate X,L 2 aminoalkonic acid is prepared by the reaction of diethylacetamidomalonate with sodium ethoxide in anhydrous ethanol followed by the addition of the appropriate alkylhalide.The compound thus formed is deacetylated, and the sodium salt form, by reflux.ing with an alkali metal hydroxide, and decarboxylated by acidification. Purification yiclds the D,L 2 amino alkanoic acid racernic mixture. Step 2 The D,L amino alkanoic acid racemate fromStep 1 is enzymatically resolved. After N acetylation of the D,L amino alkanoic acid in glacial acetic acid with acetic anhydride, the N acetyl D,L acid is contacted with Amylase I. Amylase I is a commercially available compound, N acylamino acid aminohydrolase, obtained from hog kidneys. After reaction with the aminohydrolase, acidification with acetic acid yiclds the desired I 2 amino alkanoic acid L 2 amino 5 methylhexanoic acid, for e ampZe, upon evaporation of the filtrate. Step 3 L 2 aminoalkanol is prepared by lithium aluminum deride reduction of the methyl ester hydrochloride of the L aminoalkanoic acid from Step 3. Step 4 The sweetening agent of formula I is produced from the reaction in an anhydrous aprotic solvent of commercially available N trifluoroacetyl L aspartic acid with the L l hydroxymethyl alkaneamine. An alternate procedure is as follows Procedure B Step 1 The appropriate a bromoalkanoic acid, prepared by reaction with bromine and PC13, is added to a solution of ammonium carbonate and ammonium hydroxide.After precipitation, filtration, and recrystallization, the D,L 2 amino alkanoic acid is obtained. Step 2 The racemic alkanoic acid mixture is revolved, as in Step 2 of Procedure A. Step 3 The L 1 hydroxymethyl alkaneamine is produced by reaction of tic L aminoalkanoic acid Zit l a diborane tetrahydrofuran solvent system, followed by acid hydrolysis. Step 4 The sweetening agent of formula I is rccovered after reaction of N carbobenzoxy L aspartic acid ss benzyl ester with the L . hydroxyalkaneamine in methylene chloride in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, followed by dissolution of the N carbobenzoxy alpha L aspartyl L 1 hydroxy methyl alkaneamide so produced in acetic acid to which Pd on charcoal is added. After hydrogenation, the sweetener of formula I is recovered after purification by high pressure liquid chromatagraphy HPLC and recrystallization. The various solvents, derivatives of aspartic acid and techniques used in Procedures A and B are well known and are in the synthetic chemist s repertoire.

A gum prepared from Ingredients Percent in Grams 60 latex 18 Hydrogenated resin esters Paracumarine resin 7.5 Candellila wax Glyceryl tristearate 2.5 Ethyl cellulose 2 Calcium carbonate 20The aforesaid gum base is used with the sweeteners of this invention to prepare a chewing gum having a greatly reduced sucrose content, hence less cariogenic potential, while maintaining a desirable sweetness level Ingredients Percent by Weight Gum base 68 N a L aspartyl L l hydroxymethyl 4 methyl pentylamide 15 Corn syrup 16 Flavor 1 Chewing gum of similar sweetness intensity can be prepared using N a L aspartyl derivatives wherein the Lamide moiety is 1 hydroxymethyl 4,4 dimethylpentylamide, 1 hydroxymethyl 5 methylhexylamide, 1 hydroxymethylhexylamide, 1 hydroxymethyl 4 methylhexylamide, 1 hydroxymethyl 4,4 dimethylhexylamide, l hydroxymethylpentylamide, or 1 hydroxymethyl 5,5 dimethylhexylamide. EXAMPLE VII Sweetening compositions for addition to foods and beverages e.g., coffee and tea to enable edible matcrjals to be sweetened to suit individual tastes can be prepared in liquid or solid form. A liquid sweetener can be prepared using from 5 10 sweetener, 0.1 benzoic acid and 0.052 methyl paraben in purified water. Sweetening tablets, for addition to coffee,for example, can be prepared using 2080 mg of sweetener per tablet and standard excipients such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium henzoatc, soda ash, sodium citrate, tartaric acid, and sodium gluconate in standard tabletting procedures. The following are representative.
