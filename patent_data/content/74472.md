# Continuous hydrolysis of ketoxime.

## Abstract
A mixture of ketoxime such as methyl ethyl ketone oxime MEKO , an inorganic acid such as sulfuric acid and optionally water is fed to an intermediate point of a fractional distillation column. Steam is fed to the base of the column and operating conditions are sufficient to produce the corresponding ketone e.g. methyl ethyl ketone or its water azeotrope as the overhead product and the corresponding hydroxyl ammonium salt e.g. the sulfate as the bottoms. Crystallization of the salt from the bottoms leaves a mother liquor which may be recycled to a reboiler from which the steam is generated.
