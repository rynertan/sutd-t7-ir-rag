## Description
The present invention relates to aluminum phosphinate amine adducts, and their production and use. More particularly, it relates to the adducts of amines of the formula In this specification, the term lower is intended to mean a group having not more than about 8 carbon atoms, preferably not more than about 6 carbon atoms. The adducts of the invention are usually obtained in crystals not having specific melting points, the equi valent ratio of the amine to the aluminum 1 hydroxyethyl phosphinate being from about 0.5 to 2.0 1. Their typical product is the 1 1 adduct of the formula It has now been found that said adducts show not only a preventive effect but also a curative effect against plant diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi. Examples of the phytopathogenic fungi against which the adducts of the invention can exert their fungicidal activity are Accordingly, they can be used as fungicides applicable to plowed fields, orchards, tea garden, mulberry garden, meadow, lawn and so on. The adducts of the invention are each obtainable by reacting aluminum 1 hydroxyethylphosphinate of the formula Preferred amines are those of the formula I wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are each a hydrogen atom, a C₁ C₆ alkyl group, a C₁ C₆ alkoxy C₁ C₆ alkyl group, a C₁ C₆ alkyltio C₁ C₆ alkyl group or a cyclo C₃ C₆ alkyl group. More preferred are those wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are each a hydrogen atom, a C₁ C₆ alkyl group or a cyclo C₃ C₆ alkyl group. The most preferred amines are those wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are each a hydrogen atom, a C₃ C₆ alkyl group or a cyclo C₅ C₆ alkyl group. Even more preferred are those wherein R₁ and R₂ are each a hydrogen atom and R₃ is a t butyl group. The starting aluminum 1 hydroxyethylphosphinate II may be prepared, for instance, by the known method as described in U.S. patent 4,473,561. Still, an aqueous solution of aluminum 1 hydroxyethylphospinate II prepared by an alkali metal salt of 1 hydroxyethylphosphinic acid with an aluminum salt such as aluminium nitrate or aluminium sulfate in an aqueous medium may be as such used for the reaction with the amine I so as to obtain the adduct of the invention.

Yield, 1.8 g 42.3 . ¹H NMR determined in deuterium oxide acidified with hydrochloric acid using TMS as an external standard Aluminum 1 hydroxyethylphosphinate 3.5 g 0.01 mol was dissolved in water 30 ml , followed by addition of cyclopentylamine 1.30 g 0.015 mol at 10 to 15 C. The reaction mixture was kept at the same temperature for 2 hours and at 25 to 30 C for 12 hours, and the precipitated crystals were collected by filtration. Yield, 2.1 g 54.0 . ¹H NMR determined in deuterium oxide acidified with hydrochloric acid using TMS as an external standard In the same manner as above, there were obtained the adducts of the invention, of which typical examples are shown in Table 1. For practical application of the adducts of the invention as fungicides, they may be used alone without incorporation of other ingredients therein. For easier application, however, they are normally incorporated with preparation aids such as solid or liquid carriers or diluents and surfactants to formulate preparations such as wettable powders, suspensions, granules, dusts, etc. In these preparations, the content of the adducts as the active ingredient may be usually from about 0.1 to 99.9 by weight, preferably from about 1 to 99 by weight. As the solid carriers or diluents, there may be exemplified kaolin clay, attapulgite clay, bentonite, terra abla, pyrophyllite, talc, diatomaceous earth, calcite, corn stem powder, walnut shell powder, urea, ammonium sulfate, fine powder or granule of synthetic hydrated silica, etc. As the liquid carriers or diluents, there may be employed aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. xylene, methylnaphthalene , alcohols e.g. iso propanol, ethylene glycol, cellosolve , ketones e.g. acetone, cyclohexanone, isophorone , soybean oil, cotton seed oil, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, water, etc. In addition to the solid or liquid carriers or diluents as exemplified above, there may be used ionic or non ionic surfactants for emulsification, dispersion or streading when desired. Examples of the ionic surfactants are alkyl sulfate, alkylaryl sulfonate, dialkylsulfosuccinate, poly oxyethylene alkylaryl phosphonate, condensate of naphthalene sulfonate and formalin. Examples of the non ionic sur factants are polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymer, sorbitan fatty acid ester, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, etc. There may be also used auxiliary agents such as ligninsulfonate, alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, gum arabic, CMC carboxymethyl cellulose , PAP isopropyl acid phosphate , etc. Some typical examples of the fungicidal composi tion of this invention are shown below. In those examples, part s and are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Each of Compound Nos. 1 to 10 50 parts , calcium ligninsulfonate 3 parts , sodium laurylsulfonate 2 parts and synthetic hydrated silica 45 parts are well mixed while being powdered to obtain a wettable powder. Each of Compounds No. 1 to 10 2 parts , synthetic hydrated silica 1 part , calcium ligninsulfonate 2 parts , bentonite 30 parts and kaolin clay 65 parts are thorough ly pulverized and mixed well with water. The mixture is granulated, followed by drying to obtain granules. Each of Compounds No. 1 to 10 25 parts , polyoxy ethylene sorbitan monooleate 3 parts , CMC 3 parts and water 69 parts are mixed and pulverized. Pulverization under wet conditions is continued until the particle size of the active ingredient becomes less than 5 microns to obtain a suspension. Each of Compound Nos. 1 to 10 2 parts , kaolin clay 88 parts and talc 10 parts are thoroughly pulverized and mixed well with water to obtain a dust. The composition may be applied as such or sprayed after dilution with water over the top of the plants by foliar treatment. Alternatively, the composition may be spread, mixed or incorporated into the soil. In order to improve the fungicidal activity, the composition may be used with other plant disease controlling agents. Further, they can be applied in combination with insecticides, acaricides, nematocides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, ferti lizers, soil improvers, etc. A suitable amount of the fungicidal composition of the invention to be applied is generally from about 0.5 to 200 grams, preferably from about 1 to 100 grams, in terms of the active ingredient per are. When the composition is in the form of wettable powder, emulsifiable concentrate or aqueous solution, it is normally diluted with water and then applied. The concentration of the active ingredient on the application may be within the range of about 0.005 to 2 by weight, preferably about 0.01 to 1 by weight. In case of the composition being in the form of dust or granule, it is ordinarily applied as such. Since, however, the amount and concentration largely depend upon composition forms, appli cation times, application methods, application sites, diseases and crops, they may be increased or decreased appropriately.
