# A testing method and a device for testing subjects to be tested.

## Abstract
When a plurality of subjects to be tested are continuous ly and sequentially measured, and the values obtained by measurement are compared with a standard value for judgement, a prescribed number of newly inputted mea sured values are sequentially stored, a mean value is computed based upon stored values for determining the standard value for judgement, and said measured values are compared with the standard value for judging whether these measured values are to be employed or not. Whenever new measured values are inputted, a new standard value is determined. If there is a value for an inferior subject among newly inputted measured values, the value is omitted from com putation of the standard value for judgement.
