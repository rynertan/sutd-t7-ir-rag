# Method for preparing a water absorbent starch product.

## Abstract
A water absorbent starch product is made by a method in which an aqueous dispersion of starch, water, free radical initiator and ethylenically unsaturated monomer, which monomer consists essentially of monomer having a boiling point of at least 100 C, is simultaneously polymerised and dried at a temperature above 100 C to provide a dry, water absorbent starch product or a precursor thereof. Effective water absorbent starch products, essentially free from water soluble salts and free radical initiator contaminants and containing a high level of functional water attractant groups, may be directly manufactured without the need for further refining or chemical modification.
