## Description
This invention relates to a low energy scanning electron microscope for investigating the properties of self supported thin films in the transmission mode. Low energy in this context refers to electrons having an energy not exceeding ten electron volts. In the well known conventional transmission electron microscope the electron source typically is a hair pin shaped tungsten wire which emits electrons when heated. The electrons are then accelerated in an electric field of 40 to 100 kV, and, after focussing, transmitted through a very thin specimen. An electron lens arranged downstream from the specimen generates a 50 to 100 fold enlarged intermediate image. By means of one or more additional electron lenses, the intermediate image is further enlarged and projected onto a screen for observation. Usually in conventional electron microscopes the specimen is damaged by ionising events caused by the electrons incident on its surface with energies of tens or even hundreds of keV. Indeed, in some cases such as with electron beam lithography, such ionising events might have a useful function. But in the investigation of protein crystals or other biological molecules for bio medical purposes, such ionization effects cause catastrophic damage to the specimen and are highly undesirable. Unfortunately, it is not practical with a conventional electron microscope to reduce the energy of the electrons to a few electron volts or less because a very low acceleration voltage will result in an electron beam which cannot be suitably focussed. Either the resulting beam diameter would be much too large for practical use or the electron density in the resulting beam would be too low to be of practical use or both . This situation exists with respect to the conventional transmission microscope both when it is operated in the conventional imaging mode and when it is operated in the scanning mode. It is an object of the present invention to advance the usefulness of transmission electron microscopy by providing a way of avoiding the use of a high energy electron beam and thereby reducing or avoiding damage to the specimen. This object and other objects have been achieved by the present invention in which a low energy scanning transmission electron microscope has been formed. It has already been established that slow, i.e. low energy, electrons can be transmitted through self supported thin films. H. Kanter, Slow Electron Beam Attenuation by Gold Films, Appl. Phys. Lett. 10, 1967, pp. 73 75 showed that if electrons with a 1,1 eV energy are incident onto a self supported gold film of a thickness of 20 nm, one electron in 50 000 will emerge from the far side of the film without loss of energy. For a 5 nm gold film Kanter s findings can be extrapolated to give a transmission of one in about 500. While these are average values for a large area electron beam, one might expect to find higher values if the electron beam can be very narrowly focussed to form a more intense small area low energy electron beam. As previously pointed out, however, this cannot be done with a conventional electron beam apparatus, since low energy electron beams cannot be focussed to form a small area beam of practical electron density. In accordance with this invention, a small area of a surface is bombarded with low energy electrons without any need to do focussing by emitting the low energy electrons form a point source and positioning the point source suitably close to the film being investigated. When the separation between the pointed electrode and the film is less than about 1 nm, the electron clouds of the atoms at the apex of the pointed electrode and at the surface opposite the apex touch, and a tunnel current path is established between the apex of the pointed electrode and the film. When the separation is more than about 3 nm, electrons must leave the pointed source via field emission. When the separation is between about 1 and 3 nm, both current effects are experienced. In any case, the area of the surface receiving the electrons has a diameter roughly equal to the distance between the point source and the specimen. In the prior art, low energy electrons also have been emitted from a point source positioned close to a surface in the Scanning Tunneling Microscope, described by G. Binnig et al., for example, in the article entitled, Surface Studies by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy , 49 Phys. Rev. Lett. 57 61 1982 , and in the article entitled, Tunneling Through a Controllable Vacuum Gap , 40 Appl. Phys. Lett. 178 180 1982 , and in U.S. Patent 4,343,993. Low energy electrons have also been emitted from a point source positioned close to a surface in the apparatus described by R.D. Young in Field Emission Ultramicrometer , 37 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 275 278 1966 . While it may be observed in retrospect that these prior art devices incidently irradiate a small surface area with low energy electrons, these devices were not used to do transmission electron microscopy but rather were used to measure distance or height. In the present invention low energy electrons from a point electron source are being applied to a thin film for the purpose of transmitting some of the electrons through the film for collection by an electron detector. The specimen being irradiated with the prior art devices was not in the form of a thin film. Low energy electrons did not pass through the prior art specimen. In the prior art devices the effect that the proximate surface had upon the emission characteristics of the source was used to control or measure the position of the electron source with respect to the surface for the purpose of measuring the position or height of the proximate surface. No known prior art uses a point electron source positioned very close to a surface for the direct and sole purpose of applying low energy electrons to a small area of the surface of a specimen for the purpose of transmitting some of the electrons through the specimen rather than for detecting the position or height of the surface. Details of an embodiment of the invention will hereafter be described by way of example and with reference to the attached drawings in which FIG. 1 is a diagram showing the range through which the electrons can travel between scattering events, with relation to their energy. The diagram suggests the existence of a low energy window for electrons with energies below 10 eV. For the electrons to arrive at the surface 2 of the material 3 to be investigated the distance between the apex of the electron emitting point 1 FIG. 2 and surface 2 must be on the order of 1 nm for an energy of about 10 eV. Two operating modes can be distinguished. First, for a distance greater than approximately 3 nm, the electrons leave point 1 by field emission. Second, for a distance shorter than 1 nm, the electrons Cooper pairs leaving point 1 will tunnel through that distance. For both these modes, the energy of the electrons is on the order of 1 eV. The material to be investigated takes the form of a self supported thin film 3, i.e. the material is mounted across a hole in a support 6 as shown more clearly in FIG. 3. Of the electron beam 4 incident upon surface 2 of thin film 3, some electrons will be transmitted through the material either with or without loss of energy. These transmitted electrons can be detected by a conventional electron detector 5 arranged on the opposite side of film 3. The arrangement of FIG. 2 shows the transmission of the electron beam 4 through one particular spot of the specimen 3. It is known in the art to scan the specimen in a regular fashion so as to form an image of the entire specimen. In the conventional scanning electron microscope the scanning action is obtained by way of appropriately deflecting the electron beam on its way from the electron gun or field emission source to the specimen. A cathode ray tube is scanned in synchronism with the beam deflection electronics, such as by driving from the same scan generator, so that each beam position on the specimen corresponds to a unique position on the cathode ray tube. In contrast to the conventional scanning electron microscope, the microscope in accordance with the present invention requires a different scanning system since the electrons here travel only through a distance of a few nanometers at most , and this does, of course, permit neither the deflection of the beam nor the placing of the deflection coils or electrodes. Therefore, a rather simple mechanical deflection mechanism may be used which employs, e.g. lead screws for coarse positioning of the point 1 with respect to film 3, and piezoelectric elements for fine positioning and scanning. Mechanical positioning and scanning apparatus suitable for this purpose has been described by Binnig et al. in the articles and patent cited earlier. Another suitable piezoelectric XY translator is described in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin Vol. 26, No. 10A, March 1984, p. 4898 f. These devices permit a one to one correspondence to be established between each point on the specimen or film 3 and each point on the cathode ray tube. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that instead of a cathode ray tube display a graphical recorder such as a plotter can be used with as long as the mentioned one to one relationship between locations on the specimen and on the image is maintained. As the electron beam is scanned across the specimen, it is caused at each scanning location to dwell for some fixed length of time which is determined by the speed of the display or plotting system used and by the size of the irradiated area. During this dwell time or a part thereof , the electrons interact with the specimen and produce a transmitted electron beam the intensity of which depends on the characteristics of the specimen at the particular scanning location. The transmitted electrons are sensed by an appropriate detector, and the signals formed by that detector are suitably amplified and used, for example, to control the brightness of the cathode ray tube display for the particular scanning location, or to control the instantaneous print density of a plotter, or to plot a single line scan or an array of line scans. It should be apparent to one of ordinary skill in this art, furthermore, that the signals formed by the detector or an amplified version thereof alternatively or additionally could be stored for later conversion to pictorial representation or for use by a computer capable of doing image processing. Detectors useful for monitoring transmitted electrons are known in the art. One example is the Everhart Thornley detector described in J.Sci.Instr., 37, 246 1960 . Any secondary electron detector which can be used in a scanning electron microscope, also should be suitable for the purpose. A microscope in accordance with the present invention is schematically shown in FIG. 3. An electron emitting point source 1, a holder 14 for a thin film 3 of the material to be investigated, and an electron detector 5 are supported directly or indirectly via one or more mechanical drives from a common frame 10 within a vacuum chamber 12 which may be part of an existing scanning electron microscope . Source 16 maintains either a constant voltage or a constant current across a small gap 18 separating the electron emitting point source 1 and the thin film 3. In the constant voltage mode of operation, for example, the potential of electrode 1 may be maintained by source 16 at about 0.5 to about 10 volts negative with respect to the potential of the thin film 3. A mechanical scanning mechanism is associated either with the electrode 1 or with the specimen holder 14, whichever is most convenient. In FIG. 3, an X, Y mechanical scanning mechanism 20 is mounted directly upon frame 10 and controls the motion of electrode 1 in the X and Y directions via an arm 22. The electrode 1 is carried by the Z drive 24, which is in turn mounted also on the frame 10. Dynamic control of the Z position, in addition to the scan directions X, Y, allows the distance between electrode 1 and surface 2 of the specimen to be maintained constant despite any possibly roughness of the surface. An X, Y scan generator 26 provides signals to X, Y drive 20 for scanning point 1 across surface 2 along the X and Y coordinates. Simultaneously, a separation control unit 28 responding to sensed signals characteristic of the actual separation between the surface 2 and the electrode 1 develops a Z signal for separation control by the Z drive 24. If source 16 maintains a constant voltage across gap 18, then separation control unit 28 may respond to the amplitude of the current flowing between the surface 2 and electrode 1, since at constant voltage this current becomes larger if the separation between surface 2 and electrode 1 is reduced. This current may be detected indirectly as illustrated by monitoring the amount of current flowing to the specimen or specimen holder with a current amplifier 30. Alternatively, the current flowing from electrode 1 to the constant current source 16 may be directly monitored not illustrated . If source 16 instead maintains a constant current across gap 18, then separation control unit 28 may respond to the voltage across gap 18 not shown , since at constant current this voltage depends upon the separation between electrode 1 and surface 2. Detector 5 collects electrons which pass through film 3 and provides either an amplitude signal or a series of pulses to amplifier 32 for display unit 34. Display 34 is scanned in synchronism with the scanning of point 1 since both receive their scanning signals from the same scan generator 26. Display 34 may be a cathode ray tube or a graphic output device such as a plotter or similar device. In view of the fact that electrode 1 is scanned over surface 2 at a separation distance in the nanometer range, and that the resolution attainable with a piezoelectric X Y translation mechanism also is on the same order or magnitude, it is important that the electrode 1 and specimen 3 be isolated from external sound and vibration. This may be achieved, for example by mounting everything inside of vacuum chamber 12 on a damped suspension apparatus 36. The damped suspension apparatus may simply consist of a stack of plates 38 separated by elastic members 40. In order to provide for absorption of vibrations of different frequencies, the cross sections and or elasticities of the elastic members 40 may vary along the stack.
