# Flexible surgical stapler and handle actuator assembly and firing head assembly suitable therefor.

## Abstract
A flexible surgical stapler assembly 10 includes a staple firing head assembly 14 and a handle actuator assembly 12, 80 connected to the staple firing head assembly 14 through a flexible spine 16 . The staple firing head assembly 14 in cludes an anvil assembly 132 defining an anvil surface which provides an array of staple forming depressions 182 . A staple housing 130 on the staple firing head assembly carries an array of staples 176 to be formed. A staple pusher 166 means on the staple firing head assembly 14 is provided for exerting a force on the staples in the staple housing 130 to eject the staples from the housing and form the staples against the anvil surface. The handle actuator assembly includes a housing 82 which defines an inner cavity 30 . A cable carrier 88 is provided within the cavity and is freely slidable within the cavity. A length of flexible cable 86 is connected at one of its ends to the cable carrier 88 and at its other end to the anvil assembly 132 of the staple firing head assembly 14 . A trigger mechanism consisting of a lever 104 is provided on the housing 82 operatively connected to the cable carrier 88 for moving the cable carrier 88 and thereby concomitantly forcing the staples out of the staple housing 130 to form the staples against the anvil surface.
