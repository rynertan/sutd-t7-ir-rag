# Process of preparing hydrophilic polyolefin fibers, the fibers so produced, and paper containing said fibers.

## Abstract
Hydrophilic polyolefin fibers are prepared by treating an anionic fibrous polyolefin composition containing carboxylic functionality with an aqueous admixture of selected cationic and anionic water soluble, nitrogen containing polymers. The anionic polyolefin composition may, for example, be a pololefin containing carboxyl groups which have been introduced into the polymer molecule by grafting the polyolefin with a monomer containing carboxylic functionality or by oxidizing the polyolefin with oxygen or ozone or the composition may be a polyolefin in admixture with an anionic polymer containing carboxylic functionality. Blends of the hydrophilic fibers with wood pulp provide paper products having improved physical properties.
