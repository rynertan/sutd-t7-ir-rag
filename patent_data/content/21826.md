# Apparatus for electrolyzing an aqueous solution.

## Abstract
Apparatus for electrolyzing an aqueous solution, includes a plurality of electrolytic cells 1a to 1e disposed at a plurality of vertically spaced levels and divided by partitions 2b to 2f from one another. An uppermost cell 1a has an inlet 4 for said solution and a lowermost cell 1e has an outlet 5 for said solution. Each of the cells 1a to 1e is separated by at least one dividing wall structure 6a to 6e into at least two horizontally adjacent cell unit 7a and 7b, 7c and 7d, 7e and 7f, 7g and 7h, and 7i and 7j. Each dividing wall structure is adapted to direct the flow of said solution from the top of one of said cell units 7a, 7c, 7e, 7g, and 7i into the bottom of adjacent cell unit 7b, 7d, 7f, 7h and 7j, thereby enabling said solution to flow successively through each cell unit. A last cell unit, 7b, 7d, 7f and 7h of each cell but the lowermost cell is provided with an opening defining a passage 8 extending from the top of said last cell unit to the bottom of a cell unit 7c, 7e, 7g and 7i at a lower level immediately below said last cell unit to direct the flow of said solution downwardly from said last cell unit into said cell unit at the lower level. Each cell unit 7a to 7j is provided with an anode and a cathode which are vertically disposed opposite to each other, and form a bipolar electrode assembly extending between adjacent cell units. Moreover, each cell unit has a gas collecting zone 13a to 13j defined above the anode and cathode, and each but the lowermost unit 7a to 7h is provided with a gas riser 14a to 14h extending from one of the partitions 2b to 2f defining the bottom of the cell unit to the gas collecting zone 13a to 13h in which the gas riser has one open end, each gas riser 14a to 14h having another end extending through said one partition and opening into the gas collecting zone 13c to 13j in the cell unit 7c to 7j immediately below said cell unit 7a to 7h. The uppermost cell 1a is provided at its top with a gas outlet 15.
