# Method and apparatus for conveying linear articles.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for conveying linear articles while maintaining the specific orientation thereof. The apparatus includes a supply station for supplying linear articles having a specific orientation, means for distributing to a plurality of locations the linear articles supplied by the supply station, and for holding the linear articles at those locations, a weighing station for weighing the linear articles deposited in the weighing scales of weighing machines, a pair of walking beams provided along the direction of conveyance with a multiplicity of first holders for taking up the distributed linear articles and with a multiplicity of second holders for taking up the linear articles deposited in the weighing scales of the weighing machines, a crank mechanism for oscillating the pair of walking beams while moving them in the direction of conveyance, an electronic computing unit for forming combinations of weight values of the linear articles deposited in the weighing scales of the weighing machines, and for selecting the best combination of weight values whose sum is closest to a preset target weight, and holder drive means for actuating those first and second holders which correspond to the weighing machines that give the best combination of weight values. The linear articles are disposed at said plurality of locations and at the weighing stations so as to be situated on circular orbits described by the actuated first and second holders as the walking beams are oscillated. By oscillating the walking beams the linear articles which give the best combination are discharged from the weighing station by the actuated second holders and, at the same time, the weighing scales of the weighing machines giving the best combination are supplied with the articles from the plurality of locations by the actuated first holders.
