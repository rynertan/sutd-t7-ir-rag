# GAS ANALYSER

## Abstract
The invention relates to gas analysers e.g. for analysing the carbon monoxide content of flue gas. It is known to test e.g. for carbon monoxide content, by directing infra red radiation through a gas in a wavelength absorbed by carbon monoxide, and to use detectors for infra red radiation, the level of radiation received by the detectors being utilised to evaluate the carbon monoxide content of the gas. The object of the invention is to provide gas analysing equipment which avoids the problems of taking gas samples from a flue and avoids the problems known in in situ equipment employing a beam splitter and two detectors where the detectors must be substantially identical in character. The objectives of the invention are met by a gas analyser characterised in that two detectors 8,9 are provided on to which infra red radiation is to be focussed there being a beam splitter 6 sited between a collecting lens 4 , to focus radiation on the detectors, and the detectors, either a gas cell 7 said gas cell containing a sample of gas being analysed, or an equivalent means, sited between the beam splitter and the detector 8 , a pass filter 5 sited between the radiation source and the detectors, to transmit radiation in a waveband absorbed by the gas under analysis, and there being means 11 or 12 to eliminate the part of the said radiation specifically absorbed by the said gas in that waveband adapted to be positioned periodically in the path between the radiation source and the detectors in addition to or in place of the band pass filter 5 .
