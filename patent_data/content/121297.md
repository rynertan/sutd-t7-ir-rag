# Continuous extrusion of metals.

## Abstract
A continuous extrusion machine, in which feedstock is admitted at 50 to a peripheral groove 12 in a rotating wheel 10 , is enclosed in that groove by a cooperating shoe 24 , and is frictionally dragged along the arcuate passageway 48 formed by said groove and a projecting portion 30 of said shoe towards an abutment 36 carried by the shoe. The pres sure in the metal in front of the abutment continuously extrudes a metal product through a die 42 . The abutment tip and adjacent wheel parts disposed downstream of the abut ment are cooled directly by a jet of cooling fluid issuing from a nozzle 64 carried downstream on the shoe. An annular band 74 of a good thermally conductive metal embed ded concentrically in the wheel enhances the cooling obtained. Flash 68 extruded through clearance gaps 32, 34 be tween cooperating wheel and shoe surfaces is intercepted and broken off periodically, in short lengths, by teeth 70 pro jecting from the wheel. The radial depth of the passageway 48 progressively decreases in the direction of wheel rotation in a zone extend ing upstream from the abutment 36 , so as to improve in that zone, in the case of particulate or comminuted feedstock, the metal flow pattern adjacent the abutment, such feedstock in that zone being in a fully compacted condition without voids. This is achieved by the shaping of a surface 40A of a die block 40 which adjoins the abutment 36 and incorporates the die member 42 . That shaping produces with particulate or comminuted feedstock a metal flow pattern closely resembl ing that achievable with feedstock in solid form. A continuous extrusion product 102 issuing from a continuous extrusion apparatus 10 100 is threaded through a treatment die 104 whereby to change its cross section, and is continuously drawn there through by a tensioning device 106, 112 under the control of a system which a senses the temperature of the product 102 as it leaves the extrusion apparatus 100 b converts a temperature signal 120 so produced, in a function generator 124 , into a tension reference signal 126 c compares with that tension reference signal a tension feedback signal 116 derived from a sensor 118 adjacent the extrusion apparatus and d controls the tensioning device in accordance with the difference of the tension reference and feedback signals so as to prevent the sensed tension in the product extending be tween the extrusion apparatus 100 and the treatment die 104 from exceeding a safe value which is less than the yield stress tension of that product at the sensed temperature.
