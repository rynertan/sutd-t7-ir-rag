# ELECTRO CONDUCTIVE ELASTOMERIC MATERIALS

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing an electro conductive elas tomeric material comprises mixing together silicone polym er gum, graphitic carbon particles, curing and cross linking agents in the presence of an oil having a carbon chain length of at least 16 and having a high degree of mesogenicity, together with a volatile additive in which the oil and gum dissolve and or disperse miscibly. The volatile additive may be Toluene, Chloroform, Tetrahydrofuran, n Hexane or SBP3.
