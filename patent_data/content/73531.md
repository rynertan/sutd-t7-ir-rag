# METHOD AND DEVICE FOR MOVING PROPAGATING CASES INTO AND OUT OF A STAND, AND METHOD AND DEVICE FOR GROWING PRODUCTS

## Abstract
A method of moving propagating cases into and out of a standard in which a plurality of propagating cases 6 are supported one above the other by supporting members 7 forming part of the standard, whereby the propagating cases are dispaced with respect to the supporting members with the aid of rollers 21 adjustable in a direction of height with respect to the supporting members. Further a method of growing products in superim posed cases is described in which lights 12 are arranged above the cases and air is withdrawn from the room in which the cases are located to pass along the light source.
