# Printed wiring board for recording or displaying information.

## Abstract
This disclosure concerns printed wiring boards for recording or displaying information. The printed wiring board comprises an insulated substrate 12 , a plurality of functional elements R11 R15 placed on the insulated substrate, a plurality of strip wires SA1 SA5, SB1 SB5 formed on the insulated substrate, each of the strip wires connected to a respective functional element, and at least two of the strip wires having different lengths such that one is longer than the other, each of said strip wires comprising a two layer portion and a single layer portion, said two layer portion comprising a lower layer 13 having a first resistivity and an upper layer 14 having a second resistivity which is lower than said first resistivity, said single layer portion 17 comprising the same material used for forming said lower layer, wherein the resis tance of the single layer portion of said shorter strip wire is higher than the resistance of the single layer portion of said longer strip wire.
