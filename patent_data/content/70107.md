## Description
ANHYDROUS LS This invention relates to anhydrous cells such as batteries. A lithium anode in a cell is, when considering the efficiency of the cell, highly desirable because the use of a lithium anode results in a very high voltage at a very low equivalent weight. Lithium however tends to react with the organic electrolyte solvent present in the cell. When this happens, the reacted lithium is lost for recycling purposes thereby reducing the efficiency of the cell and such loss leads to a premature demise of the cell.Additionally, the rea ction product of the lithium and organic eIectrolyte solvent is deposited on the anode and the anode eventually b ecomes insulated from participation in the el ectrochemical reactions of the cell thereby leading to cell failure. Further, lithium tends to form dendrites during recharge, These dendrites, which are a furry, poorly adherent form of lithium, tend to fall from the anode and are thereby removed from the electrochemical reactions of the cell. Additionally, the falling of this furry form of lithium may eventually lead to short circuiting of the cell because bf the eventual bridging of the lithium from the anode to the cathode. One prior attempt to solve the problems associated with the use of a lithium anode was to use an electrolyte solvent, 2 methyltetrahydrofuran and an electrolyte of lithium hexafluoroarsenate. Although this combination had some positive effect on the cyclability of lithium, the increased cyclability was still somewhat limited and excess lithium had to be employed to compensate for the lithium lost to the system. Another attempt to solve the problems associated with the use of a lithium anode was to use an anode composed of lithium aluminium alloy.This only minimally reduced the reactivity of the lithium and therefore was not an effective solution to the aforedescribed problems. In an article entitled Organic BatteryUses Polyacetylen,e,E,lectrodes11 appearing inChemical and Engineering News, pages 39 and 40,January 26, 1981 Ã¤ ceil is disclosed which contains an n doped polyacetylene film anode an organic anode and a p doped polyacetylene film cathode.The elctrolyte disclosed is tetra N butylammonium perchloratev This cell, although having some interesting characteristics, suffered from the disadvantage of having a low energy density.Additionally, because lithium is lacking in that cell, although the disadvantages of lithium are not present, neithe r are its advantages. Further, the polyacetylene film of the anode and cathode will, with the passage of time, suffer a ioss of their electrical conductivity properties thereby reducing the efficiency of the cell. It is known that certain inorganic anodes will intercalate lithium or sodium ions. See for, example JElectrochem. Soc., Accelerated Brief Communication, pages 773 and 774 entitled A Cyclable Lithium OrganicElectrolyte Cell Based on Two Intercalation Electrodes,M. Lazzari, et al, March, 1980 J Electrochem. Soc., D.Murphy et al, pages 349 through 351, entitled LowVoltage Behavior of Lithiumj Metal DichalcogenideTopochemical Cells, March, 1979 and J. Electrochem. Soc., pages 2097 through 2099r Gerald H. Newman, et al, entitled Ambient Temperature Cycling of an. Na TiS2. Cell , October, 1980. The term intercalating or intercalation, as used in the specification and claims, means the ability, of an inorganic anode to absorb lithium or other metal ions so that the lithium or sther metal ion complexes or otherwise associates itself With the inorganic anode without ever forming lithium or other metal from such ions. U.S. Patent 4,222,903 is directed to. p type electrically conductive doped polyacetylene film and a method for preparing such film. U.S. Patent 4,204,216 is directed to electrically conductive doped polyacetylene film exhibiting n type electrical conductivity and a method for preparing the same. Both of those patents disclose that p doped polyacetylene powder has been prepared byBerets et al., Trans. Faraday Soc. Volume 64, page 823 through 828 1968 . Both of those patents disclose that the highest room temperature electrical conductivity which Berets, et al achieved is still relatively low.Thus indicating that the electrical conductivity properties of polyacetylene powder are not as great as the electrical conductivity properties of polyacetylene film. As stated previously, p doped polyacetylene film will, with the passage of time, suffer a loss of its electrical conductivity properties thereby severely reducing the efficiency of a cell utilizing a p doped polyacetylene cathode. In accordance with this invention it has now been found that a cell having a polyacetylene containing cathode with stable electrical conductivity properties and an inorganic intercalating anode can have advantageous recyclability properties and a high energy density. Accordingly this invention resides in a substantially anhydrous cell comprising a a cathode which comprises a mixture of polyacetylene powder and an electrically conductive material, b an organic soIven t, c an electrolyte comprising a salt which is soluble in said solvent and d an inorganic intercalating anode, said cathode being insoluble in said solvent when said cathode is either undoped or p doped, said solvent being stable to electrochemical decomposition and the anions of said salt being capable of p doping said polyacetylene when an external electrical power source is supplied to said cell. The anode may comprise any inorganic intercalating electrode material and preferably comprises an inorganic intercalating material having a potential less than 1.3V with respect to Li liO. The anodic material is able to intercalate ions of one or more of lithium, sodium or potassium without resulting in the formation of the zero valent metal of the ionsy,hich are intercalated by the anodic material. The inorganic intercalating anodic battery grade materials which may be used include titanium disulfide first and second plateaus , vanadium diselenide first and second plateaus , vanadium disulfide first and second plateaus , tungsten dioxide, m olybdenum dioxide, and other transition metal dichalogenides and the like. Among the preferred anodic materials which have a potential less than l. 3V with respect to Li Li and which are capable of intercalating ions of one or more of lithium, sodium or potassium are the following battery grade materials tungsten dioxide the second plateau of vanadium diselenide, the second plateau of vanadium disulfide, the second plateau of titanium disulfide and molybdenum dioxide. The use of the second plateau of titanium disulfide as the anodic material is extremely efficient in intercalating lithium ions and a cell employing such material can exhibit a very high voltage. The term battery grade has been used above in describing the materials which may be used to prepare the inorganic intercalating anode. The term battery grade refers to the stoichiometry of the inorganic intercalating material and may also refer to its crystalline or other physical characteristic. For example, U.S. Patent 4,084,046 refers to stoichiometric titanium disulfide TilS2 as being useful as a cathode in a cell. This patent also discloses that the titanium disulfide should have a single hexagonal phase and a particle size surface area between about 2 and 4 square meters per gram and that the titanium disulfide have crystallites with small aspect ratios, i.e. the ratio of the basal plane axis to the vertical axis. U.S. Patent 4,194,062,in describing the use of sulfides and selenides of vanadium and titanium as electrodes in a cell , sets forth that when these materials are used as intercalating materials in a cell, as either the positive or negative electrode, the composition of the intercalating materials may deviate by as much as plus or minus five percent from stoichiometry. U.S. Patent 4,233,375 sets forth a number of intercalating materials useful as a cathode in a cell.The materials set forth in the 375 patent include TS and VSey wherein y is a numerical value of about 1.8 to about 2.2 and VSa wherein a is a numerical value of about 1. 8 to about 2.7 In general, one skilled in the art will readily be able to determine the preferred deviation, if any, from the stoichrometric formula, of any of the intercalating materials set forth herein Although the ions being intercalated may be ions of lithium, sodium or potassium, it is preferred that the ions being intercalated be lithium because of the low equivalent weight of lithium and the ease with which lithium is intercalated. The cathode comprises polyacetylene powder and an electrically conductive material. When the cathode is electrochemically p doped, it then becomes a p doped cathode. Any cathode of a cell, must perform two functions. The cathode must provide the elctron transfer half reaction the other half reaction is provided by the anode and additionally, must have sufficient electrical conductivity to collect and transport these electrons polyacetylene powder provides the electron transfer half reaction and some electrical conductivity. By using a cathode composed of an electrically conductive material and polyacetylene powder, the cell life becomes improved and rechargeability of the cell is enhanced because the electrically conductive material performs the function of electron transport and the polyacetylene powder performs its function, of providing the electrontransfer half reaction. The electrically conductive material, in order to be most useful. in this invention, should have a stabLe el ecitrical conductivity of at least 10 6 ohm cm 1 Additionally, the electrically 10 6 ohm cm 1 Additionally, the electrically conductive material must be completely insoluble in the electrolyte solvent and must be electrochemically inert under the strong oxidizing conditions present during recharge of the cell and the milder reducing conditions present during discharge of the cell. The electrically conductive material used in this invention will also be determined by the intended function of the cell. For example, for a heart pace maker, the cell utilized generally has a low drain. In such a case, an electrically conductive material having a minimal electrical conductivity could be utilized. In other applications, such as an electric car, th e cell must have a high drain and a more electrically conductive material, such as a carbon, would be used. Any electrically conductive material may be used which meets the requirements set forth above and which can be intimately associated with the polyacetylene matrix so as to provide stable electrical conductivity throughout the cathode. Among the electrically conductive materials which may be used are the carbons such as carbon black, acetylene black, graphite and mixtures thereof. Other electrically conductive materials which may be used, provided they meet the requirements set forth above, include gold,pl atinum palladium, rhodium, silver, mer cury,selenium, silicon and conductive polymers, such as polypyrrole and poly sulfur nitride . The amount of electrically conductive material which is associated with the polyacetylene will usually vary from 3 to 75 by weight of electrically conductive material based on the total weight of polyacetylene plus electrically conductive material Lesser anounts may be used but may result in insufficient electrical conductivity of the electrode.It is however preferred to use the minimum amount of electrically conductive material necessary to achieve stable electrical conductivity of the cathode as well as intimate association of the electrically conductive material with the polyacetylene matrix because such minimum amount will only minimally increase the cell dead weight Amounts in excess of 75 are also not desirable because they will only.add to the cel l dead weight and will therefore adversely affect the energy density of the cell. In a particularly preferred embodiment, polyacetylene powder is mixed with a carbon, such as carbon black or graphite. The electrically conductive material should desirably have a particle size such that intimate mixing of the electrically conductive particles with the polyacetylene particles can be accomplished. In the battery art, when powdered materials are used they generally have a particle size of about 30 millimicrons. After intimate mixing of the powders, it is often desirable to compress the powder mixture, for example into the form of a disc, so that it can be more easily handled. If desired, a binder such as polytetrafluor,oetliylene,, may be used to hold the polyacetylene, powder electrically conductive material disc together. Alternatively, the powder mixture may be poured on a support which is to serve as a separator in the cell. The cathode may be el ectrically p doped in a manner similar to that disclosed in the Journal of the Che mical Society Chemical Communications,No.14, page 594, Nigrey et,al., July, 1979. In practicing this invention, a cell may be constructed having a titanium disulfide anode, a polyacetylene powder electrically conductive material mixture as the cathode and an electrolyte of lithium hexafluoroarsenate dissolved in sulfolane. Thereafter, when a current is passed through the cell the cathode is p doped with hexafluoroarsenate ions. In practice, the electrochemical p doping is continued until the desired charge is obtained, as measured by an ammeter. Alternatively, one may utilize a cathode which has been p doped prior to assembly in a cell. The electrolyte used is a salt of the metal ion to be intercalated and must be soluble in the electrolyte solvent, preferably in an amount of at least 5 by weight of the electrolyte solvent and more preferably at least 20 soluble in said solvent, and even more preferably 40 soluble and most preferably even more than 40 soluble. When the electrolyte used is less than 5 soluble in the electrolyte solvent, the effectiveness of the cell decreases For example, when the electrolyte used is less than 1 soluble, a minimally effective cell is obtained. Generally, the greater the solubility of the electrolyte in the solvent, the more efficient will be the cell Among the electrolytes which may be used are the salts of perchlorates, tetra fluoroborates, hexafluorophosphates, hexafluoro arsenates, hexafluoroantimonates, fluorosulfonates, trifluoromethanesulfonates, tetrachloroaluminates, and the like The solvent for the electrolyte may be any organic solvent in which the electrolyte is soluble, as aforestated, but one in which the p doped and undoped cathode is insoluble. The solvent which is used should be substantially inert to both the cathode and anode, capable of dissolving the electrolyte in at least the minimum amounts set forth herein and stable to electrochemical decomposition. Among the solvents which may be used are sulfones including cyclic sylfones, ethers including cyclic ethers, organic carbonates including cyclic carbonates, esters, lactones, organic sulfites and amides. Among such organic solvents may be mentioned propylene carbonate, sulfolane, dimethoxy ethane, bis methoxyethyl ether, dioxane, 3 methyl sulfolane, tetrahydrofuran, ethylene carbonate, methyl formate, butyrolactone, dimethyl sulfite and dimethylformamide. The cell is generally assembled under anhydrous conditions to eliminate the deleterious effect of water in connection with the operation of the cell The cell itself may be a thin cell, such as a button cell. A multitude of layers may be disposed one on top of the other and connected to one another in series or in parallel. In order to more fully illustrate the nature of this invention and the manner of practicing the same, the following example is presented.EXAMPLE 1 In a glass cup is placed a saturated solution of lithium hexafluoroarsenate in. sulfolane. A disc is formed of battery grade TiS2 obtained from Exxon Enterprises disc having a surface area of 0.85 cm2 ,. The disc weighs 120 mg. and is suspended in the solution as a cathode and a lead is attached thereto. A piece of lithium in excess of the amount necessary is suspended in the solution as an anode and a lead is attached thereto. The leads are connected to a constant current power supply. The cell is discharged at 1 ma for six hours still leaving the TiS2 on the first plateau. The lithium anode is disconnected from the power supply.A disc, pressed onto a nickel screen and containing 15 mg of polyacetylene powder, 12 mg. of finely divided carbon and 3 mg. of a polybutadiene binder, is suspended in the solution and a lead attached thereto and connected to the constant current power supply. The TiS2 electrode is now the anode with respect to the more positive polyacetylene containing electrode, which is the cathode. The lithium electrode is left suspended on the solution as a reference electrode. The cell is charged at 1 ma.During charge, the voltage rises to about 1.6V after two hours. The cell is discharged. The cell is allowed to stand for about three weeks in its discharged condition.Cycling is then resumed and the cell is successfully recycled a number of times. Comparative Experiments conducted with non battery grade vana dium disulfide non battery grade tungsten dioxide and non battery grade titanium disulfide all resulted in ineffective batteries.
