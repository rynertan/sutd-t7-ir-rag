# Method and apparatus for detecting tool breakage, for example in a numerically controlled machine tool.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for detecting tool breakage rely on specific cutting resistance change patterns oc curring on tool breakage. By comparing a stored standard cutting resistance change pattern, corresponding to a tool breakage, with cutting resistance change patterns actually occurring as the tool machines a workpiece, tool breakage ist detected. For example, cutting resistance at tool breakage may suffer a temporary reduction before rising to a new higher value. For example, cutting resistance is sampled at regular intervals period of pulses SP , change in resistance bet ween samples compared with a fixed value σ and the results coded in dependence upon the change being greater than the fixed value code 1 , less than the negation σ of the fixed value code 1 , or lying between the fixed value σ and its negation σ code 0 . A code value sequence e.g. 1,1,1,1 indicative of cutting re sistance change pattern is provided and compared with the standard change pattern e.g. 1,1,1,1 similarly coded. The method and apparatus can be used in numerically controlled machine tools.
