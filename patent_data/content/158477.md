# Tamper evident closure and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a method of manufacturing a tamper evident closure 10 having a detachable annular tamper indicating portion 32 includes a step of testing the connection between the detachable portion and the remainder of the closure. The testing may comprise either use of optical detection apparatus 62, 64 or use of a deflection measuring system which applies radial pressure to the detachable portion. A tamper evident closure having a detachable annular tamper indicating portion includes gaging means 60 to cooperate with optical detection apparatus to enable detection of closures having unacceptable tolerances.
