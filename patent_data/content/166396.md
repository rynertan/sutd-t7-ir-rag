# Emulsions of crosslinked polydiorganosiloxanes.

## Abstract
This invention is a method of producing a latex of cross linked polydiorganosiloxane. The latex yields an elastomer upon removal of the water. The latex is prepared by homo genizing a mixture of hydroxyl endblockedpolydiorganosil oxane, less than 75 millimoles of surface active anionic ca talyst per kilogram of polydiorganosiloxane where said sur face active anionic catalyst is dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid or hydrogen lauryl sulfate, and water to yield an oil in water emulsion. This emulsion is them admixed with from 0.5 to 15 parts by weight of an alkoxy silicon compound selected from a silane of the formula R
