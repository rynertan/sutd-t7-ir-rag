# Analytical method and element for albumin.

## Abstract
An assay for the determination or detection of albumin in a liquid sample involves the use of an oxonol dye. This dye has a high affinity for albumin over a wide pH range. When the dye is bound to albumin, a shift in the dye spectral absorption occurs. The dye can be used in either wet or dry analytical methods.
