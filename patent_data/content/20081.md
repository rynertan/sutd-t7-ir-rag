# Laminates comprising an electrode and a conductive polymer, and process and apparatus for their production.

## Abstract
The invention relates to laminates of a sheet electrode 11, 21 having openings therein and a conductive polymer 3 . According to the invention, novel laminates are prepared by passing an apertured tape electrode 11, 21 and a heat softened conductive polymer 3 through an aperture formed by to or more rollers so that the conductive polymer is pressed against the electrode while it is supported by an indented roller. In the product, the conductive polymer penetrates into and through the openings in those parts of the electrode which overlay the indentations of the roller and into, but not through, the openings in other parts of the electrode. The laminates are useful in electrical devices, especially heaters and circuit control devices.
