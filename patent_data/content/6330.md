## Description
GEAR SHIFT CONTROL LINKAGE . This invention relates to gear shift control linkages for transmissions and more particularly to a gear shift control linkage for use with a remote control manual transmission mounted on a front drive vehicle with a transversely mounted engine at front. In a front drive vehicle of the above mentioned t me, its trans ission is arranged transversely and fixed to the engine to constitute a single power unit. The transmission is controlled by a gear shift control linkage including a gear shift control lever which is located behind the transmission and operatively connected to it by a control rod. In this type of vehicle, when a torque is transmitted from the power unit to front road wheels or vice versa through a final drive unit and cardan or half shafts, there is created a torque reaction which tends to rotate the power unit rearwardly or fonfardly of the vehicle.As a result, the power unit rocks or is displaced forwardly and rearwardly, causing the gear shift control lever to swing responsively. In this instance, since the gear shift control lever is pivoted at its lower end and of a consicierable leng ltl relative to its diameter and has at its upper handle end a control knob of an appreciable weight relative to its overall weight, the swing of the gear shift control lever in response to forward and rearward displacement of the power unit is viable to be amplified, which inevitably causes a deterioration of the feeling of the gear shift control lever on manipulation and, in the worse possible case, causes the gear of the transmission to jump out of engagement. There is shown diagrammatically in Figure 4 of the accompanying drawings of this application, a conventional gear shift control linkage for use with a transmission in a vehicle of the afore mentioned type. In Figure 4, designated by reference numeral 10 is a transmission which is connected integrally with an engine not shown , by 12 a vehicle body, by 14 a buffer member, made of a resilient material such as rubber, which is interposed between the vehicle body 12 and the transmission 10, by 16 a control rod connected at its forward end to a gear shift actuating shaft 18, and by 20 a gear shift control lever which has a lower connect nag end connected to the rearward end of the control rod 16 and an upper handle end fitted with a control knob 20b. The gear shift control lever 20 is pivotally connected at 20a to the vehicle body 12, that is, the gear shift control lever 20 is carried at 20a on a fixed fulcrum about which it turns in moving the control rod 16 and therefore the gear shift actuating shaft 18 in order to effect gear shifting of the transmission 10. With this arrangement, when the transmission 10 is displaced by S1, tJie control knob 20b is displaced by Sp. In this instance since the diplacement of the control knob 2Gb in response to that of the transmission 10 is amplified by the effect of leverage, S2 is larger than S1. Figure 5 of the accompanying drawings of this application shows another conventional gear shift control linkage for use with a transmission in a vehicle of the afore mentionod type. In this ccnventional gear shift control linka√® ofFigure 5, wherein like parts to those of Bignlre 4 are given like reference numerals, a support rod 22 is provided which is attached at its forward end to the casing of the transmission 10 and supports at its rearward end a support bracket 24. The support bracket 24 slidably engages, by way of a buffer member 26 made of a resilient material such as rubber, with a vehicle body 12 and pivotally supports at 20a a gear shift control lever 20.Thus, in this type gear shift control linkage, the gear shift control lever 20 is carried at 20a on a movable fulcrum which is movable In a straight line in response to displacement of the transmission. With this arrangement, when the transmission 10 is displaced by S1, the support bracket 24 is displaced byS2 together with the gear shift control lever 20. In this instance, since the gear shift control lever 20 is displaced in a parallel manner, that is, the angular position of the gear shift control lever 20 about the fulcrum 20a is kept unchanged, the displacement S2 of the control knob 20b is equal to the displacement S1 of the transmission 10. These conventional gear shift control linkages are disadvantageous since the control knob 20b is displaced appreciably in response to displacement of the transmission 10, which inevitably causes a deterioration of the feeling of manipulation of the gear shift control lever 20 and, in the worst possible case, causes the gear of the transmission 10 to jump out of engagement. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a gear shift control linkage for an automotive transmission, which alleviates at least one of the fore going drawbacks inherent in a conventional gear shift control linkage of the described. types. According to the present invention there is provided a gear shift control linkage for u c with a transmission in a vehicle, the transmission having a casing and a gear shift actuating shaft and fling adapted to perform gear shifting by selective movement of said gear shift actuating shaft, the shift control linkage comprising a gear shift control lever having an upper handle end and a lower connecting end, a control rod linking the connecting end of said gear shift control lever with said gear shift actuating shaft, support means supporting the gear shift control lever at a portion thereof between said handle end and said connecting end so as to form a fulcrum about which the gear shift control lever turns in moving said control rod and therefore the gear shift actuating shaft end connecting means connecting the support means to the casing of the transmission, characterised in that said support means is pivotally connected to the connecting means and to the body of the vehicle such that said fulcrum is displaceable in the arc and in that the connecting means connects said support means to the casing of said transmission in such a manner that when said transmission is displaced relative to the body of the vehicle in either of the alternate directions of pushing and pulling said control rod, the fulcrum is displaced in the arc in the corresponding direction and by an amount which is smaller than that of displacement of the lower connecting end of the gear shift control lever. The gear shift control linkage according to this invention may be constructed so that the displacement of the control knob or handle end of its gear shift control lever in response to that of the associated transtnission is limited to quit c a small value and is suitable for use with a remote control manual transmission mo nted on a front drive vehicle of the desscribed type. Further gear shift control linkage according to the invention can improve feeling of manipulation of its gear shift control lever. Also the gear shift control linkage w ll prevent the gear of corresponding trans mission from, jumping out of engagement and is sitnple in construction and easy to manufacture. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevational view of a gear shift control linkage embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a fragmentary cross sectional view taken generally along the line II II of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a diagrammatie representation of the gear shift control linkage of Figure 1 and Figures 4 and 5 are schematic side elevational views of conventional gear shift control linkages with which the present invention is concerned. A gear shift control linkage embodying the present invention will now be described with reference to Figures 1 to 3 inclusive, in which like parts to those of Figures 4 and 5 are given like reference numerals and will not be described again for the sake of brevity. The gear shift control linkage of this invention is provided with a support link 30 which has an upper pivot end pivotally connected at 32 to a bracket 34 by means of pivot pins 32a as shown in Figure 2 the bracket 34 is in turn fixedly secured to a vehicle body 12. The support link 30 further has a lower connecting end pivotally connected at 36 to the bifurcated rearward end of a support rod 22 by means of pivot pins 36a as shown in Figure 2 the forward end of the support rod 22 is pivot fi 1 connected at 38 to the casing of a transmission 10. A gear shift cojjtrol lever 20 has an upper Jiandle end fitted with a control knob 20b und a lower connecting end linked by means of a control rod 1G with a gear shift actuating shaft 13. More specifically, the control rod 16 is arrariged to have a longitudinal axis transverse to that of the gear shift control lever 20 and has a rearward end connected at 00 to the lower connecting end of the gear shift control lever 20 and a forward end connected at 4 2 to the gear shift actuating shaft 18.The control rod 16 is also arranged to be substantially parallel to the support rod 22, as shown. The gear shift control lever 20 is pivotally supported at 20a. i.e. at a portion thereof between the handle end and the connecting end, by the support link 30.In other words, the support link 30 is adapted to have a fulcrum 20a about which the gear shift control lever 20 turns in moving the control rod 16 and therefore the gear shift actuating shaft 18 in order to effect gear shifting of the transmission 10. In this instance, it is to be noted that the fulcrum 20a is arranged so as to be located on the support link 30 between the pivot points 32 and 36, i.e. between the upper pivot end and the lower connecting end thereof. Nore specifically, as shown in Figure 2, the gear shift control lever 20 is formed with a ball shaped section 20c, while the support link 30 is provided with pivot means comprised of a rigid socket casing 30a welded or otherwise secured to the body of the support link 30 and a nylon or other suitable material socket member 30b fitted within tlie socket casing 30a. With this, the ballshaped section 20c and the pivot means are assembled to form a ball and socket joint. The operation of the gear shift control linkage thns constructed according to the pre rani invention will now be described. When the transmissiol l 10 is displaced Iorwardly , i.c. in tlle direction of pulling the control rod 1G, the support rod 22 and the control rod 16 are displaced fer . ardly, i.e in the direction indicated by arrows A and B of Figure 1. When this occurs, as diagrammatically shown in Figure 3, the fulcrum 20a and the pivot points 36 and 40 move from the right handed positions into the left handed positions, respectively. In this instance, since the pivot point 32 remains stationary, the displacement of the fulcrum 20a is smaller than that of the pivot points 36 and 40.As a result, the gear shift control lever 20 is caused to turn slight y rearwardly about the fuller 20a, i.e. the angular position of the gear shift control lever 30 is changed whereby the resulting displacement of the control knob 20b is limited to a small value. The most suitable position of the fulcrum 20a on the support link 30 depends on the lengths of the gear shift control lever 20 and the support link 30 and the maximum amount of displacement of the transmission 10. By determining the position of the fulcrum 20a suitably, the displacement of the control knob 20b in response to that of the transmission 10 can be limited to quite a small value. The illustrated gear shift control linkage according to tliis invention produces the similar effect as previously described when the transmission 10 is displaced rear wardly, i.e in the direction of pushing the control rod 16. From the foregoing description, it is to be understood that the gear shift control linkage of this invention is provided with pivotal support means supporting the gear shift control lever 20 at a portion thereof between the handle end and the connecting end so as to form a fulcrum which is movable in a circular arc and about which the gear shift control lever 20 turns in moving the control rod 16 and t laerefore tlle goaJ shift actllaLIn shaft 18 in RTI ID 7.28 orkler to effect gear shifting of the transmission 10. It will be approciated that the ilbustrated gear shift control linkage according to this invention is provided with connecting means irtting the connecting end of the support link 30 with the casing of t e transmission 1G in such a manner that when the transmission 10 is displaced relative to the body 12 of the vehicle in either of alternate directions of pushing and pulling the control rod 16 in the fulcrum 20a is displaced in the circular arc in the corresponding direction and by an amount which is smaller than that of displacement of the connecting end of the gear shift control lever 20.
