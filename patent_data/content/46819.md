## Abstract
A reagent is described for the quantitative determination of water, used together with an iodine containing titrating solution, the reagent containing sulfur dioxide and an anhydrous alkali metal trimethyl acetate or a mixture of anhydrous alkali metal trimethyl acetate and an anhydrous alkali metal salicylate dissolved in 2 methoxy ethanol, methanol or in a mixture of 2 methoxy ethanol and methanol in a volume ratio of at least 10 to 90. This reagent is distinguished in that the increase of the blind value is minimized even at elevated temperatures.
