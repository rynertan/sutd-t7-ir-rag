# Plasmidic expression vehicles, and method of producing a polypeptide therewith.

## Abstract
Novel plasmidic expression vehicles are provided for the production in bacteria of heterologous polypeptide products, the vehicles having a sequence of double stranded DNA comprising, in phase from a first 5 to a second 3 end of the coding strand, a trp promoter operator, nucleotides coding for the trp leader ribosome binding site, and nucleotides encoding translation initiation for expression of a structural gene that encodes the amino acid sequence of the heterolo gous polypeptide. The DNA sequence referred to contains neither a trp attenuator region nor nucleotides coding for the trp E ribosome binding site. Instead, the trp leader ribosome binding site is efficiently used to effect expression of the information encoded by an inserted gene.
