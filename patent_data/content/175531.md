# SEALING ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
An inflatable sealing element comprises a a body of elastomeric material having an internal chamber and being adapted when inflated to bear against a non com pressible surface to effect a seal, b a feed spigot for supplying fluid to the internal chamber of a to cause the latter to inflate, and c a rigid reinforcing member substantially filling the internal chamber of a when the latter is in the deflated condition. The presence of the reinforcing member ensures more ac curate positioning of the internal chamber and greater uniform ity of expansion of the body, thereby improving the seal. The seal is suitable for use in ball valves.
