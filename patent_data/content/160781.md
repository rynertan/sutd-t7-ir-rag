# Measuring and detecting printed circuit wiring defects.

## Abstract
A non contact system for detecting printed circuit wiring defects and for measuring circuit feature height relative to a substrate. The system has an energy source 32 for illumi nating at an angle the substrate 30 and circuit features 31 and a scanner 36, 38 for both instantaneously receiving energy reflected from the substrate and circuit features and for generating a plurality of signals in response to the reflected energy, which signals are adapted to vary with the intensities of the locally reflected energies. An analyzer is connected to the scanner for correlating the generated signals to a measurement representative of the height of the circuit features relative to the substrate. Variations and non uniformity of the substrate surface due to bending, warpage or other causes can be accounted for so as to provide an accurate measurement of the height of a circuit feature relative to the substrate surface on which it is mounted.
