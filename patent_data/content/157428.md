# SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE WITH LOW NOISE STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device which has low noise structure and is operable with high stability. The memory device employes a plurality of single transistor memory cells each composed of a capacitor and a transistor coupled between one electrode of the capacitor and a bit line, the other electrode of the capacitor being supplied with a predetermined potential. The other electrode is made of a refractory metal and a relatively low sheet resistance is provided to the other electrode of the capacitor so that the potential fluctuation at the other electrode of the capacitor is suppressed.
