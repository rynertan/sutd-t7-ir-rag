# Electrochemical cell and electrochemical battery.

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell having two electrodes of oppo site polarity cooperating with an electrolyte solution to pro duce an electrical potential therebetween during normal operation, configured to minimize explosions upon forced discharge or charging by locating at least a portion of one electrode in close proximity to the other electrode such that a low impedance path is created between the two electrode surfaces whereby the quantity of externally imposed current flowing through the main body of the cell is minimized. In a preferred embodiment, portions of the two electrodes have contiguous surfaces spaced from each other by a porous separator material 24 with the surfaces chosen to allow plating dendritic growth from one electrode to the other at potential differences below that at which electrolysis occurs.
