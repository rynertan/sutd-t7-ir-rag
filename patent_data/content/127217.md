# New process for the preparation of 20 keto delta16 steroids and new intermediate compounds formed in this process.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a new process for the introduc tion into steroids of a 17 side chain containing a 20 keto group under the simultaneous formation of an unsaturated bond between C₁₆ and C₁₇ by reaction of 17 isocyano sulfonyl methylene steroids with an alkylating agent to 20 isocyano 20 sulfonyl delta¹⁶ steroids, followed by hydrolysis of these latter compounds to 20 keto delta¹⁶ steroids. The invention also relates to the intermediate compounds which are formed in this process, i.e. 20 isocyano 20 sulfonyl delta¹⁶ steroids and to the ultimately formed 20 keto delta¹⁶ steroids, as far as these latter compounds are new.
