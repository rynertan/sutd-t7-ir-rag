# Tape speed determining apparatus for video signal reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A tape speed determining apparatus applied to a video signal reproducing apparatus employing a helical scanning system, a rotating head system and a pilot signal system serves to determine automatically the recording mode of a video tape to be reproduced, in case where two kinds of recording modes, i.e. a standard recording mode and a long recording mode, are applicable and the speed of a video tape differs dependently on the respective recording modes. The tape speed determining apparatus delays by an in finitesimal time t the timing for selection of the reference signals f₁ and f₃ out of the reference signal f₁ to f₄ supplied at the time of reproduction, as compared with the reproduc ing head selection timing. An error signal generated during this delayed time t is sampled and held for a frame period. A wavelengh of a fundamental wave of the sampling output is determined by counting the number of capstan rotation detecting pulses, and thus the recording mode of the video tape is determined as a function of the count value.
