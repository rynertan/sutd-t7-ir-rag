# Autoclavable intraocular lens for implantation in the anterior chamber of the eye.

## Abstract
The implant is formed of a glass optic 12 which is plano convex, its posterior surface being curved. The optic 10 is mounted in a haptic 14 which comprises two sets of flat feet 16 lying in the same plane as one another. The optic 14 has fenestrations 22 to enhance the circulation of fluid in the anterior chamber. The haptic is formed either of a metal such as titanium or of an autoclavable clinically inert thermo plastic material such as a polyethersulphone.
