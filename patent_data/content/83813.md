## Description
HEAT CURABLE EPOXY COMPOSITIONS AND THEIR USE IN PREPARING FORMED ARTICLES This invention relates to heat curable epoxy compositions and their use in preparing formed articles. The use of urethane technology in reaction injection RIM moulding systems is well known. In RIM technology the mixed urethane foam ingredients are injected into a mould cavity through a runner and a gate at low pressure, usually about 0.14 MPa, where they react quickly to produce moulded articles.Large parts can thus be produced very quickly at relatively low mould pressures. Such elastomers normally comprise the reaction product of an aromatic polyisocyanate, a polyol and a chainextending agent. Moulding compositions of epoxy resins by contrast are usually prepared by placing an epoxy composition comprising an epoxy resin and curing agent in a suitable mould, with or without reinforcement, and curing the composition under high pressure and at elevated temperature. These cured epoxy compositions exhibit good physical and chemical properties. It would be desirable, however, to be able to produce cured articles at a faster rate from epoxy compositions which exhibit physical and mechanical properties which are equal or superior to standard casting resins. U.S. Patent No. 3,492,269 is directed to a process for hardening epoxy resins using certain inorganic metal salt accelerators such as NaCI or NaBr, for the curing of epoxy resins. These cured compositions cannot be used in RIM applications because of the relatively slow gel times. It is an object of the invention to provide heat curable epoxy compositions suitable for use in reaction injection moulding processes. According to the present invention there is provided a heat curable composition comprising 1 an epoxy compound having on average more than one epoxy group per molecule 2 a curing amount of at least one amino compound containing at least three amino hydrogen atoms per molecule 3 a catalytic amount of a Group I or Group 11 metal salt selected from the group consisting of nitrates, iodides, thiocyanatesd alkoxides, and perchlorates, and sulphonates, and 4 a polyalkylene ether glycol. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the metal salt is selected from the group consisting of nitrates, iodides, thiocyanates, alkoxides and perchlorates and the composition additionally includes 5 a miscible amount of at least one ethylenitally un saturated monomer and 6 a peroxide free radical initiator. Suitable epoxy compounds for inclusion in compositions of the invention comprise those compounds containing on average at least one epoxy group per molecule, i.e. at least oneEMI2.1 group. These epoxy compounds may be saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic and may be substituted if desired with non interfering substituents, such as halogen atoms, hydroxyl groups and ether radicals. They may also be monomeric or polymeric. Various examples of liquid epoxy compounds which may be used in the compositions of the invention are given in U.S.Patent No. 2,633,458. Other suitable epoxy compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,373,221 and 3,377,1406. Preferred epoxy compounds are the glycidyl polyethers of polyhydric phenols and polyhydric alcohols, especially the glycidyl polyethers of 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane having an average molecular weight between 300 and 3,000 and an epoxide equivalent weight between 140 and 2,000. Other suitable epoxy compounds include those compounds derived from polyhydric phenols and having at least one vicinal epoxy group wherein the carbon to carbon bonds within the sixmembered ring are saturated. Examples of such epoxy compounds are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,336,2141. Preferred saturated epoxy compounds are the hydrogenated glycidyl ethers of 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, sometimes called the diglycidyl ethers of 2,2 bis 4 cyclohexanol propane. Other examples of suitable epoxy compounds are the glycidyl novolac resins, e.g. the phenolaldehyde condensates described in U.S. Patent No. 2,658,885. A particularly preferred epoxy compound comprises a glycidyl polyether of a polyhydric phenol, preferably a a diglycidyl ether of 2,2 bis hydroxyphenyl propane optionally blended with b a diglycidyl ether of hydrogenated 2,2 bis 14 hydroxyphenyl propane. Conveniently the weight ratio of a b is in the range 50 50 to 80 20, with a 75 25 blend being preferred. The amino compound in the composition may conveniently be one or more of an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic polyfunctional amine or a polyamide. Suitable polyfunctional amines include amines of the following general structure EMI3.1 wherein each R is an alkyl, aryl or alkaryl radical of up to about 8 carbon atoms and x has a value of from 0 to 10, and preferably 1 to 3. Examples of suitable such polyfunctional amines include diethylenetriamine DETA and triethylene tetramine TETA as well as cycloaliphatic diamines such as cyclohexane diamine and 14,14 diaminodicyclohexylmethane, and aromatic polyamines such as methylene dianiline MDA , and meta phenylee dismine. The cycloaliphatic diamines are preferred, cyclohexane diamine and 4,4 diaminodicyclohexylmethane being most preferred polyfunctional amines. Other suitable polyfunctional amines are the polyoxypropyleneamines aliphatic, terminally branched, primary di and triamines, structurally derived from polypropylene glycols and triols commercially available under the trade mark JEFFAMINE . A typical structure is as follows H2NCH CH3 CH2 r 0CH2CH CE3 2 x wherein x has an approximate value of from about 2.5 to about 3.5. Polyamides which are suitable for use in the present compositions may be saturated or unsaturated as well as monomeric or polymeric. Polyamides which are especially useful in the present compositions are those derived from polymeric fatty acids and aliphatic polyamines. Polyamides of this type are disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 2,450,940. Typically, these polyamides are those made from polymeric fatty acids containing up to about 22 carbon atoms in the monomeric acid with ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine or triethylene tetramine. It will be appreciated that polyamide resins may have terminal amine groups or terminal carboxyl groups or contain molecules in which some of the terminal groups are amine groups while others are carboxyl groups. The polymeric fatty acids employed in preparing the poly asides are those resulting from the polymerization of drying or semi drying oils, or the free acids or simple aliphatic alcohol esters of such acids. Suitable drying or semi drying oils include soybean, linseed, tung, perilla, oiticica, cottonseed, corn, tall, sunflower and safflower oil, and dehydrated castor oil. In the polymerization process for the preparation of the polymeric fatty acids, the fatty acids with sufficient double bond functionality combine for the most part, probably by aDiels Alder reaction, to provide a mixture of dibasic and higher polymeric acids. The acids with insufficient functionality to react remain as monomers and may be wholly or partially removed, for example by distillation.The residue after distillation consists of the desired polymeric acids and this mixture is used for the preparation of the polyamide resin. In place of this method of polymerization, any other method of polymerization may be employed whether the resultant polymer possesses residual unsaturation or not. The term polymeric fatty acids1 as used herein, is intended to include the polymerized mixture of acids obtained, which mixture usually contains a predominant portion of dimeric acids, a smaller quantity of trimeric and higher polymeric acids, and some residual monomer. These polymeric fatty acids may be reacted with a variety of aliphatic polyamines for the production of the polyamide.The amidification reaction may be carried out under the usual conditions employed for this purpose, as will bye evident from the examples. Polyamides of this type generally have molecular weights varying from 1,000 to 10,000 and are resistant to the corrosive action of water, alkali, acids, oils, greases, and organic solvents. The melting points vary, depending upon the reactants and the reaction conditions. Where aliphatic diamines, such as ethylene diamine, are employed for the preparation of the polyamide the resin typically melts within the approximate range of 100 1200C, and more usually within the range of 100 1050C. Higher melting polyamide resins, for example melting within the range of 130 2150C, may be made by employing a mixture of polymeric fatty acids and other polybasic acids, the latter having at least two carboxyl groups which are separated by at least 3 and not more than 8 carbon atoms. Typical of these polTbasic acids are the aliphatic acids, e.g. glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, and sebacic acids, and the aromatic acids, e.g. terephthalic and isophthalic acids. The melting point of the copolymer resin may vary within the range previously indicated, depending upon the particular reactants, relative ratios thereof, as well as the reaction conditions. Low melting polyamide resins melting within the approximate range of 25 900C may be prepared from polymeric fatty acids and aliphatic polyamines having at least 3 atoms intervening between the amine groups principally involved in the amidification reaction. These three atoms may be carbon atoms or hetero atoms.Typical of the polyamines which may be used are diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, 1,4 di aminobutane, 1,3 diaminobutane, hexamethylene diamine, 3 N iso propylamino propylamine, and 3,3 imino bis propylamine. A preferred group of these low melting polyamides are derived from polymeric fatty acids, and di ethylene triamine and are liquid at ambient temperature. Suitable such polyamides are commercially available under the trade designation of VERSAMID registered Trade Mark polyamide resins, e.g. VERSAMID 140 V 140 and are ambercoloured polyamides having a molecular weight ranging from about 3,000 to about 10,000 and a softening point from below ambient temperature to 1900C and prepared by condensing polymerized unsaturated fatty acids e.g., dilinoleic acid with aliphatic polyamines, such as diethylene triamine or triethylene tetramine. Such adducts of a polymeric fatty acid and triethylene tetramine or diethylene triamine are particularly preferred polyamides. The preparation of such VERSAMID polyamide resins is well known and by varying the acid and or the functionality of the polyamine, a great variety of viscosities, molecular weights and levels of active amino groups spaced along the resin molecule can be obtained. Typically, the VERSAMID polyamide resins have amine values from about 50 to 400 Gardner colour max. of 8 10 and viscosities of from about 1 to 30 poises. Although useful for some applications, the polyamides pt r li are less preferred than the polyfunctional amine s however, blends of polyamides with polyfunctional amines are more preferred. Preferred polyfunctional amines for such blends are the aliphatic and cycloaliphatic amines, especially the cycloaliphatic diamines, such as diaminocyclohexane and 4,4 diaminodicyclo hexylmethane. Preferably, the amount of amino compound employed will be that amount required to furnish one amino hydrogen per epoxy group stoichiometric amount , although up to about 50 excess of epoxy compound may be employed and up to about 100 excess of amino compound may be employed. The preferred Group I and Group II metal salts are lithium, calcium and magnesium salts with calcium salts being especially preferred. Nitrates, iodides and perchlorates are preferred salts of such metals. Accordingly, preferred catalyst salts include lithium iodide, lithium nitrate, calcium nitrate, calcium perchlorate and magnesium nitrate. Excellent results are obtained with calcium nitrate. In general, a catalytic amount of salt is employed. For most applications, the catalyst will be used from about 0.05 to about 5.0 parts.by weight per 100 parts of epoxy compound phr , with from 0.1 to 3.0 phr being preferred and from about 0.5 to about 2.0 phr being especially preferred. The polyalkylene ether glycol preferably has an average molecular weight between about 200 and about 1500 and is more preferably a polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of from 200 to 600 or a polypropylene glycol having an average molecular weight between 400 and 1,000. Polyethylene glycols are most preferred. The amount of polyalkylene ether glycol will vary somewhat depending upon the particular epoxy compound, amino compound and metal salt used. However, the weight ratio of polyalkylene ether glycol to metal salt may conveniently range from about 1 3 to about 2 1. For most applications amounts of polyalkylene ether glycol ranging from about 0.1 to about 3 parts by weight per 100 parts epoxy are advantageous. Preferred ethylenically unsaturated monomers are the unsaturated aromatic monomers such as styrene, alpha methyl styrene halo substituted styrenes such as chlorostyrene nitro substituted styrenes such as nitrostyrene alkyl substituted styrenes such as tertiary butyl styrene divinylbenzene, vinyl toluene 2 vinJa.pyriaine N vinyl pyrrolidone, and vinyl naphthalene. Especially preferred is styrene, optionally blended with divinylbenzene. Other suitable monomers, which are preferably blended with styrene, include 1 esters of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, 2 cyano containing unsaturated compounds 3 allyl containing compounds, and 4 olefins or diolefins and 5 alkyl phenols. Suitable unsaturated monocarboxylic acid esters include the alkyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, alpha phenylacrylic acid, alpha cyclohexylacrylic acid, maleic acid, alpha chloromaleic acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, fumaric acid, cyanoacrylic acid and methoxyacrylic acid. Preferred acids are acrylic acid and methacrylic acid. Accordingly, suitable such esters include methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate and trimethylolpropane trimethylacrylate. Suitable cyano compounds include acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile. Suitable allyl monomers include diallyl phthalate and triallyl isocyanurate. Suitable alkyl phenols include nonyl phenol and lower and higher homologues, and alkylated bisphenol acetone or other diphenols. Other suitable comonomers include the unsaturated aliphatic compounds, such as the olefins and diolefins. Operable such olefins and diolefins include ethylene, propylene, butylene, amylene, butadiene, isoprene, vinyl hexane, vinyl cyclohexanes, vinyl cyclopentane, vinyl cyclopentene, norbornadiene, cyclopentadiene and cyclopentadiene dimer. It will be appreciated that since some of these monomers are normally gases at ambient temperatures and pressures, their use dictates that the compositions be formulated and cured under pressure conditions. Accordingly, they may be useful in reaction injection moulding processes. The ethylenically unsaturated monomer s is are preferably included in amounts ranging from 10 to 200 parts by weight of monomer s per 100 parts by weight of epoxy compound. The peroxide free radical initiator is selected as one which is compatible with the amino compound, i.e. one which will not react with the amino compound. A simple test for compatibility comprises mixing a sample of the amino compound, preferably together with the epoxy compound, with a sample of peroxide freeradical initiator at a temperature below the decomposition temperature of the peroxide. If there is no appearance of an odour or colour, or any other evidence, e.g., spectroscopic, of decomposition, then the peroxide is deemed to be compatible with the amino compound. Preferred peroxides are the sterically hindered peroxyesters such as tertiary butyl peroxybenzoate, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 bis 2 ethyl hexanoylperoxy hexane e.g., LUPERSOL 256 trade mark , t butyl peroxy neodecanoate, t butyl peroxy pivalate, t butyl peroctoate, t butyl peroxy isobutyrate, t butyl peroxy maleic acid and t cunnl peroxy neodecanoate and dialkyl peroxides such as di terti ary butyl peroxide, di tertiary butyl 2 ,5 dimethyl 2,5 peroxyhexane. Particularly preferred peroxides are t butyl peroxy benzoate and 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 bis 2 ethyl hexanoyl peroxy hexane. The peroxide free radical initiator is employed in an amount which is sufficient to effect the desired cure or cross linking of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer. Preferably, the amount of peroxide free radical initiator will vary from about 0.25 to about 15 by weight based on the ethylenically unsaturated monomer. The selection of the amino compound and the peroxide freeradical initiator should preferably be one wherein the particular amino compound tends to start t cure of the epoxy groups before the peroxide initiates polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer at the temperatures employed in curing the composition. The compositions of the present invention are especially suitable for use in reaction injection moulding RIM techniques because of the rapid curing possible. Accordingly, the invention further provides a process for preparing formed articles which comprises bringing a composition according to the invention into a mould and curing by application of heat, and extends to formed articles prepared by the process. RIM techniques and equipment are well known. For illustration a preferred process of the invention is outlined below. The epoxy compound and the metal salt and polyalkylene ether glycol and, where appropriate, some of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer and peroxide are mixed and added to the resin reservoir of a RIM apparatus, and the amino compound and, where appropriate, the remaining ethylenically unsaturated monomer is added to the curative reservoir, although in some cases the metal salt can be added to the curative reservoir. In general, the resin mixture is maintained at about 450C 250C when monomer is included to about 700C and the curative amino compound is brought to about 300C 200C when monomer is included to about 500 C. The temperatures are representative and typical only and the temperature range may be expanded according to the particular components employed.Then by means of a dispensing and metering means, the two streams from the reservoir are brought under high pressure into a mixing head 6.9 MPa to 20.7 MPa, 1000 to 3000 psi, preferably 8.3 MPa to 14 MPa, 1200 to 2000 psi or, when monomer is included, 3.45 to 20.7 MPa, 500 to 3000 psi, preferably 3.45 to 10.4 MPa, 500to 1500 psi . The mixing head is opened on a predetermined signal and the two streams flow together under turbulent mixing conditions and flow directly into the mould. After a suitable time, e.g. 30 to 300 seconds, at about 800C 1000C when monomer is present to about 160 C, the mould is opened and the article removed. Of course, other materials may be mixed or added to one or both of the reaction streams, including plasticizers, stabilizers, extenders, oils, resins, plastics, elastomers, tars, asphalts, pigments, reinforcing agents, thixotropic agents, anti oxidants and mould release agents. In addition various kinds of continuous stand or chopped strand glass, carbon fibre, Kevlar or a prepreg may bepreplaced in the mould before the streams from the mixing head are introduced into the mould. The invention will be further understood from the following illustrative Examples, in which, unless otherwise indicated, parts and percentages in the examples are parts and percentages by weight. Epoxy Resin A is a liquid glycidyl polyether of 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane having an epoxide equivalent weight of 175 190 and an average molecular weight of about 350. Epoxy Resin B is a liquid glycidyl polyether of hydrogenated 2,2 bis 14 hydroxyphenyl propane having an epoxy equivalent weight of about 234 and an average molecular weight of about 568. PACM 20 is a 100 isomeric mixture of 4,4 diaminodicyclo hexyl methanes containing 20 of the trans, trans isomer. It is derived from the hydrogenation of methylene dianiline. V 1140 is a commercial long chain amidoamine derived by reacting a partially dimerized C 18 unsaturated straight chain fatty acid and triethylene tetramine in 1 2 molar ratio. PEG 400 is polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of about 14or. EXAMPLE I This example illustrates a typical reaction injection moulding RIM process using a composition of the invention. One hundred parts by weight of Epoxy Resin A containing 1 part by weight phr of Ca N03 2 added as 1.44 pbw of Ca N03 2.WH20 and 1 phr of PEG 1400 were added to the resin reservoir of a RIM apparatus. The Ca N03 2.4H20 was dissolved or dispersed in the resin by heating the resin to 500 600C and adding the metal salt while stirring. The PEG 400 was added after about 30 minutes at 500 600C and the resin blend cooled to room temperature. Then 28 parts by weight of PACM 20 were added to the curative reservoir. The resin was then brought to 450 to 750C in the resin reservoir and the curative reservoir was brought to 300 to 500C.Using an Accuratio dispersing and metering system and aCincinnati Milacron mixing head, the two streams were brought under high pressure of about 10.3 MPa 7500 psi to the mix head. Mix Ratio 3.5 0.2 to 1 Resin Curative . The mix head was then opened on a predetermined signal and the two streams flowed together under turbulent mixing conditions and then allowed to flow directly into the mould. After about 60 300 seconas i.e., 90 seconds at about 80 to about 1600C usually 131 0C , the mould was opened and the part removed. Most of the experimental work was done with a 20 cmx 25 cm x 0,3 cm 8 x 10 x 1 8 flat plaque steel mould wherein the mould was sprayed with a suitable mould release agent e.g., IMS 416, a silicone type prior to charging.

Into one vessel Vessel A were charged 7853 grams ofEpoxy Resin A and 4300 grams of styrene. Into the other vessel Vessel B were charged 4014 grams of PACM 20 and 4300 grams of styrene. Both vessels were stirred at ambient temperature for 20 minutes after vacuum and nitrogen passage. The RIM machine was cycled at low pressure for thirty minutes and then 1100 grams of styrene in which 120 grams of Lupersol 256 2,5 dimethyl2,5 bis 2 ethylhexanoylperoxy hexane , 90 grams of Ca N03 2.4H20 and 80 grams of PEG 400 were added to Vessel A. Low pressure circulation was continued for another 30 minutes. The RIM machine was adjusted to provide a weight ratio of components from Vessel A to Vessel B of 2.98 1.00. The mould was filled with an overflow vessel and evacuator and heated to 65 C. The RIM machine was operated to produce a 1.55 second shot of the above A B blend into the mould. The pressure on the A side was about 4.1 MPa and on the B side, about 6.9 MPa. The moulded part was held at 650C for one hour.
