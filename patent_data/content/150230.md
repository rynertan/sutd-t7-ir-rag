# Inhibitors for acid gas conditioning solutions.

## Abstract
The corrosion of ferrous metal surfaces in gas con ditioning apparatus is inhibited by using gas conditioning solutions such as aqueous alkanolamines which contain thionitrogen compounds such as metal thiocyanates or thioamides. After recycling the gas conditioning solution for a few days, the solution dissolves sufficient amounts of nickel or cobalt or other metals in the equipment to act as a synergist with the thionitrogen compounds. In the event, the equipment does not contain any soluble synergistic metals, these metals may be added to the gas conditioning solution as soluble metal salts. Examples of useful additive metals are cobalt, nickel, calcium, copper, chromium, zinc, tin, aluminum, and magnesium.

## Description
INHIBITORS FOR ACID GAS CONDITIONING SOLUTIONS This invention relates to corrosion inhibiting compositions for use in acid gas removal equipment and methods for their It is well known from the prior art that acid gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and carbonyl sulfide can be removed from gaseous feed streams such as natural gas and synthesis gas using dilute aqueous solutions of If sweetening agents such as potassium carbonate, alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, and methyl diethanolamine, and other weak bases. The usual procedure to use a contactor wherein the absorbent solution contacts the feed stream and to use a regenerator with a reboiler wherein the rich absorbent containing the acid gas components is regenerated back to the free absorbent.The solution is then recycled back to the contactor for reuse. There has been much activity devoted to solving the problem of metallic corrosion in the equipment used in the above process. This problem is particularly acute and or chronic when mild steel alloys are used in the equipment to save on capital costs over the use of more exotic and expensive metal alloys such as stainless steel. It is, of course, common practice to use stainless steel and nickel alloys in sensitive areas such as heat exchange equipment. U.S. Patent 3,087,778 63.04.30 provides for inhibition of potassium carbonate solutions by using 1,000 to 5,000 p.p.m. of the trivalent oxides of arsenic, antimony or bismuth. U.S. Patent 3,808,140 74.04.30 provides for inhibition of alkanolamine solution by using minor amounts of vanadium and antimony compounds. U.S. Patent 3,896,044 75.07.22 provides for inhibition of alkanolamine solutions by using minor amounts of nitro substituted aromatic acids or salts thereof. U.S. Patent 3,959,170 76.05.25 provides for inhibition of alkanolamine solutions using a minor amount of a stannous salt. U.S. Patent 4 071,470 78.01.31 provides for inhibition of alkanolamine solutions using a minor amount of the reaction product of copper, sulfur, and an alkanolamine. U.S. Patent 4,096,085 78.06.20 provides for inhibition of alkanolamine solutions using minor amounts of a polyamine, with or without copper and sulfur. U.S. Patent 4,100,099 78.07.11 provides for inhibition of sour gas conditioning fluids using minor amounts of quaternary pyridinium salts and alkylene polyamines. U.S. Patent 4,100,100 78.07.11 provides for inhibition of sour gas conditioning fluids using minor amounts of quaternary pyridinium salts, thiocyanate compounds. of thioamide compounds, and divalent cobalt compounds. U.S. Patent 4,102,804 78.07.25 provides for inhibition of sour gas conditioning solutions using minor amounts of a quaternary pyridinium salt, and a thiocyanate compound, a sulfide compound or a thioamide compound. U.S. Patent 4,116,629 78 09.26 provides for the corrosion inhibition of stainless steels types 410 and 430 when in contact with carbonate solutions by using nickel salts. U.S. Patent 4,143,119 79.03.06 provides for inhibition of sour gas conditioning solutions using minor amounts of copper and a polysulfide generated in situ. While the above compositions are effective, they each have various defects which detract from their universal use. For example, compounds of arsenic, antimony and vanadium are known to be toxic and their use presents waste disposal problems. The use of the quaternary pyridinium compounds are known to cause a foaming problem in certain instances. It now has been discovered that the corrosion of iron and steel in gas removal equipment can be effectively reduced by using a gas conditioning solution such as aqueous alkanolamines inhibited by effective amounts of a soluble thionitrogen compound. It is believed that inhibition results from the interaction between the thionitrogen compound and the metals naturally present in the used gas removal solution. In the event, the metals are lacking, the gas condition solution can be modified by the inclusion of effective amounts of one or more soluble nickel, cobalt, calcium, copper, chromium, zinc, tin, aluminum, or magnesium compounds. The inhibitors are advantageously constantly replenished or maintained in the gas conditioning solution in order to obtain effectice passivation. The combination of inhibitors claimed herein are unique in that they reduce corrosion of all ferrous surfaces, i.e., not only mild steel but also stainless steel surfaces except for stainless steels of the 400 series. The inhibitors of this invention are particularly effective in aqueous solutions of alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, methyl diethanolaniine and related alkanolamines that are commonly used to remove acid gases from gas streams. The impure gaseous liquid feed streams which can be treated with the inhibited gas conditioning solutions of this invention to. remove carbon dioxide can generally contain no more than a few 1 5 ppm of H2S and or carbonyl sulfide and 500 ppm or less of oxygen. Several hundred cubic feet of a feed gas con taining 300 ppm or less of H2S can be treated with the inhibited gas conditioning solutions of this invention by a simple test to select the proper metal synergist.For example metals that form insoluble sulfides generally do not give corrosion protection. Examples of useful soluble nickel compounds are nickelous sulfate, nitrate, acetate, tartrate and citrate. Examples of useful soluble cobalt salts are cobaltous halides such as the chloride, fluoride, and bromide, cobaltous sulfate, cobaltous nitrate, cobaltous acetate, and cobaltous benzoate. The other metals useful herein are used in the form of their related soluble salts. Examples of useful soluble thionitrogen compounds are alkali metal thiocyanates such as potassium thiocyanate and sodium thiocyanate and metal thiocyanates such as copper thiocyanate, and nickel thiocyanate.Ammonium thiocyanate is also useful and is the preferred species. Other examples of soluble thionitrogen compounds are thioamides having the formula A C S N R 2 where A is a hydrocarbon radical of 1 6 carbons or a pyridyl radical, R is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1 4 carbons. Specific examples of the thioamides are thioacetamide, N,N diethyl thioacetamide, thiobenzamide, N,N dimethyl thioacetamide, thiocapramide, N,N diethyl thiocapramide, and thionicotinamide. It is to be noted that the term soluble compound means, for the purpose of this invention, that the compound is sufficiently soluble in the aqueous gas conditioning solution, i.e., aqueous alkanolamine, to be useful herein. It has been found that the thionitrogen inhibitors must be maintained in the gas conditioning solutions in amounts from 50 and preferably 100 or more .parts per million. Since these compounds are depleted during use, large amounts such as 500 or more p.p.m.can be used at start up and periodic additions can be made thereafter to maintain the required effective amounts in the solution. A range from 50 to 1,000 ppm has been found to be an effective amount and a range from 100 to 300 ppm is the preferred range. It has been found that when a fresh charge of the gas conditioning solution containing thionitrogen is used in a gas conditioning plant containing various metal alloys there is a period of time of about 2 4 days in which the solution must be circulated before passivation takes place. It is believed that the gas conditioning solution dissolves sufficient trace metals to act as a synergist with the thionitrogen compounds. In the applications of this invention wherein the gas conditioning equipment is constructed solely of mild steel, one usually must add one or more of the above metal salts in the manner indicated above. The following examples are presented to illustrate but not limit the invention.Example 1 In a gas conditioning plant wherein a hydrogen gas stream of 50 million cubic feet 1.4 x 106 m3 per day at 300 pounds per square inch .2.07 MPa pressure and containing 18 percent CO2 was contacted with an aqueous solution of 18 percent by weight of monoethanol amine and the rich amine solution was regenerated in a stripping column with a reflux boiler and the lean solution was pumped back to the contactor. Suitable cross exchangers were used. Stainless steel 304 and monel components were used in the heat exchangers. Corrosion probes and metal coupons of the same metals used in the plant were placed in the cool rich amine solution, the hot rich solution and the hot lean solutions. The probes were adjusted to read the corrosion rate in mils thousands of an inch, 0.0254mm per year mpy . The base corrosion rate without inhibitor on carbon steel in the hot rich amine circuit was 740 mpy 18.8 mm year . The base corrosion rate without inhibitor on 304 stainless steel was 12 mpy 0.30 mm year . The base corrosion rate without inhibitor onMonel 400 was less than 2 mpy 0.051 mm year . After addition of 200 ppm of ammonium thiocya nate, the carbon steel corrosion rate dropped to less thQLn 2 mpy 0.051 mm year and the corrosion rate for stainless steel and Monel dropped to less than 1 mpy 0.0254 mm year . The amine concentration was then increased from 18 percent to 25 percent and the corrosion rates remained the same.Example 2 In a plant wherein CO2 was removed from a flue gas, using 18 25 percent monoethanolamine MEA , the feed gas contained from 0 to 500 ppm of oxygen and the MEA solution contained 1 5 ppm nickel in solution. The corrosion rate was found to be about 100 mpy 2 .54 mm year for carbon steel. A heavy metal corrosion inhibitor was initially used to reduce the corrosion rate. Ammonium thiocyanate at the rate of 200 ppm was added to replace the heavy metal. It was found that the corrosion rate remained in a range of 1 3 mpy 0.0254 0.0762 mm year with the MEA solution range varying from 18 25 percent.Example 3 In a similar plant to the one set forthExample 2, ammonium thiocyanate at the rate of 2 u ppm was added as a heavy metal replacement and the corrosion rate remained at 1 3 mpy 0.0254 0.0762 mmXyear . Example 4 In a hydrogen gas purification plant using 18 25 precent monoethanolamine solutions, the base corrosion rate for carbon steel without inhibitor was 350 mpy 8.89 mm year in the hot rich circuit. The base corrosion rate for 304 stainless steel was 50 mpy 1.27 mm year in the hot rich and lean circuits. After ammonium thiocyanate at 200 ppm was added, the corrosion rates dropped to less than 2 mpy 0.0508 mm year for both metals.Example 5 In a plant similar to Example 4, containing less than one ppm nickel in the monoethanolamine solution, the base corrosion rate without inhibitor was found to be 140 mpy 3.56 mm year for carbon steel and 10 mpy 0.254 mm year for 304 stainless steel. After 300 ppm ammonium thiocyanate and 50 ppm cobalt sulfate was added to the MEA solution, the corrosion rate for carbon steel dropped to 15 mpy 0.381 mm year and the corrosion rate for stainless steel dropped to 8 10 mpy 0.203 0.254 mm year .Example 6 In a plant for the removal of CO2 from natural gas using a 30 percent MEA solution using all carbon steel equipment, the base corrosion rate was found to be 60 mpy 1.52 mm year in the hot lean circuit. After the addition of 200 ppm of ammonium thiocyanate, the corrosion rate dropped to 30 40 mpy 0.762 1.02 mm year . Sometime later, 3 ppm of nickel sulfate Ni SO4 was added and the corrosion rate dropped to less than 2 mpy 0.0508 mm year .Example 7 In a natural gas purification plant similar to Example 6, using 16 percent MEA, the base corrosion rate fOr carbon steel was found to be 12 mpy 0.305 mm year in the MEA stripper section. The base corrosion rate for 304 stainless steel was found to be 12 mpy 0.305 mm year . After the addition of 200 ppm of ammonium thiocyanate, these corrosion rates changed to 7 mpy 0.178 mm year and 36 mpy 0.914 mm year respectively.After the addition of 7 ppm of nickel sulfate Ni SO4 both these corrosion rates dropped to 0.1 mpy 0.00254 mm year . The MEA concentration was then increased to 27 percent with the above combination of ammonium thiocyanate and nickel sulfate. The corrosion rates changed to 0.1 mpy 0.00254 mm year carbon steel and 0.6 mpy 0.0152 mm year stainless steel .Example 8 In a hydrogen gas purification plant using 16 27 percent MEA solutions, the base corrosion rate for carbon steel and 304 stainless steel was found to be 70 mpy 1.78 mm year and 15 mpy 0.381 ram reaL es ec This rate was reduced to less than 2 mpy 0.0508 mm year for both metals using an arsenic inhibitor. When the above inhibitor was replaced with 200 ppm of ammonium thiocyanate and 5 ppm nickel sulfate, the corrosion rate for both metals remained at less than 2 mpy 0.0508 mm year . From the foregoing, it is seen that the use of thiocyanate compounds greatly reduces the corrosion rate of the mild steel equipment used therein when the equipment also contains stainless steel or nickel alloys therein. Examples 9 103 The effectiveness of the corrosion inhibitors of this invention were determined in a static coupon corrosion test. In this test a solution of 25 and 30 percent by weight of monoethanol amine MEA in deionized water was saturated with Cho . This solution simulates a rich amine solution commonly found in gas conditioning plants. About 350 ml of this solution with inhibitors is then placed in a 2 inch by 10 inch 50.8 mm x 254 mm Teflonlined steel cylinder, prepared mild steel test coupons were inserted, and the cylinder was sealed and bolted shut. The cylinder and its contents were then heated to 1210C 2500F for 24 hours. The coupons were then removed, cleaned and weighed. The corrosion rate sn mils per year MPY is calculated from the following equation MPY 1.44 metal density in gms cm3 weight loss in mgs surface area in dm2 time in days and the results converted to millimeters year. In the manner set forth above, Tables I VIII give the corrosion rate using mild steel 1020MS at 1210C 2500F over a 24 hour period. The inhibitors used in these tests were known salts such as ammonium thiocyanate, nickel suflate, cobalt sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper carbonate and calcium sulfate. In each example, the run was usually in duplicate and the reported corrosion rate is the average of the two runs.Single runs are noted as SR .

To 400 g portions of this CO2 saturated MEA was added a sufficient amount of ammonium thiocyanate to yield 200 ppm of the thiocyanate ion in the final solution. In a similar manner 50 ppm Ni or CO was added in the form of NiSO4 6H2O or CoS04 7H2O to some of the solutions following the addition of the thiocyanate.The solution was then divided into three approximately equal portions and placed in 4 ounce 118.3 ml glass bottles containing a weighed 1020 mild steel coupon a 2 surface area of 35 cm All the samples were then placed in a SparklerFilter a water bath apparatus having a sealed lid and pressurized to 30 psig 207 kPa, guage with CO2. The pressure was then raised to 45 psig 310 kPa, guage with oxygen. The steam jacket of the water bath was then used to heat all the samples to l300C for 24 hours. When cool, the weight loss of each coupon was used to calculate the corrosion rate. The reported corrosion rates inTable IX represent the average of the three individual determinations.
