# PROCESS FOR INCREASING FUEL YIELD OF COAL LIQUEFACTION

## Abstract
A process for increasing the fuel yield of coal liquefaction products by extracting the asphaltenes, resins and aromatic compounds from said coal liquefaction products. This is accomplished by contacting said coal liquefaction products with a halogenated aliphatic solvent to form two phases, one containing tar and the other containing said solvent and the remainder of said coal liquefaction products, separating said phases from each other and treating said tar phase with a second solvent to recover asphaltenes, resins and or aromatics in said tar phase. The resulting asphaltenes, resins and or aromatics are suitable for upgrading to produce additional synthetic fuel.
