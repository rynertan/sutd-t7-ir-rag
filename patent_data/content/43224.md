# Component mask for printed circuit boards.

## Abstract
Component masks 19 are described for preserving unoccupied holes 17 in a printed circuit board 12 when such board is subjected to wave soldering. Each mask 19 is a body of high temperature resistant plastic including a support block 26 from which a plurality of parallel pins 27 protrude for reception into the printed circuit board lead holes 17 to be preserved. The pins 27 are spaced from one another by distances equal to the distances between lead holes 17 on a printed circuit board 12 , and component masks 19 are provided respectively having a single row and a double row of such pins 27 . Each pin 27 tapers slightly away from the support, and is connected to its associated support 26 by a conically shaped transition body 31 . Each transition body 31 is dimensioned to rest on the printed circuit board 12 about the lead hole 17 in which the associated pin 27 is inserted to space the support 26 away from the printed circuit board 12 . The pins 27 are dimensioned and configured to enable the lead holes 17 to be preserved during mass soldering of the printed circuit board 12 , while at the same time allowing their interior walls to be wetted with solder 29 , without the pins being wetted or conducting away undue amounts of heat.
