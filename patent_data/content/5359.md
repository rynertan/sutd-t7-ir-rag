# Method for making beta silicon carbide.

## Abstract
A method for making beta silicon carbide in a microballoon structure, that is, a spherical type structure in which the beta silicon carbide forms only a thin wall of the balloon structure, comprises pyrolyzing microballoon structures formed of an organic material so that the material breaks down to leave carbon behind in the microballoon structure. This carbon is reacted with silicon at an appropriate temperature to form the pure beta silicon carbide in the microballoon shape. If desired, the microballoon structure, which is porous, may be crushed to form beta silicon carbide of a very finely divided size.
