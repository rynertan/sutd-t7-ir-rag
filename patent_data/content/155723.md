# Harvesting machine including a disc cutterbar.

## Abstract
A harvesting machine such as a disc mower conditioner 10 is provided comprising a disc cutterbar 26 with transversely spaced rotatable cutter units 28 operable to sever standing crop material by impact action. A flexible curtain 40 extends around the perimeter of the disc cutterbar 26 . A transverse deflector panel 50 is supported by the mower conditioner frame 14 between the disc cutterbar 26 and the flexible curtain 40 to restrict the movement of the forward transverse portion 42 of the flexible curtain 401 toward the cutterbar 26 . The deflector panel 50 is pivotally mounted for fore and aft movement about a generally transverse axis and has sufficient mass to resist movement of the curtain 40 induced by an air flow created by rotation of the disc cutters 28 . The panel 50 includes a lower curved portion 54 to facilitate the passage of crop material therebeneath for presentation to the disc cutterbar 26 .
