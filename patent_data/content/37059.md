# THREE SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION WITH SPLIT TORQUE DELIVERY PATHS IN THE TWO HIGH SPEED RATIOS

## Abstract
A hydrokinetic power transmission mechanism having a torque converter 18 and two simple planetary gear units 20 and 22 in combination with the torque splitter gear unit 52 wherein the elements of the gearing are arranged with respect to friction torque establishing devices in a compact fashion to provide minimum overall dimensions so that it is adaptable for an automotive vehicle driveline with a fully hydrokinetic low speed accelerating speed ratio and a split torque delivery path during operation in the two higher speed ratios to effect an increased engine fuel economy as a portion of the engine torque is delivered hydrokinetically through the transmission system.
