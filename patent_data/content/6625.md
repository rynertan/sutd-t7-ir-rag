# Apparatus for reading data encoded badge.

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for reading a data encoded badge 42 or document, wherein the operator manually inserts the badge 42 into the reader 40 . In the preferred embodiment, there is provided a movable slide element 50 having clock holes 51 therein and means 66 for ensuring that such slide moves in synchronism with the badge 42 as it is inserted into and withdrawn from the reader 40 by the operator. Suitable sensors 102 and accompanying electronics are provided to synchronize the reading of data from the badge 42 with the detec tion of the passage of slide clock holes 51 past a predeter mined point in the reader 40 . Special reader electronics is provided to ensure reliable clock detection, and to in hibit false generation of clock signals which could result from sensor ringing.
