# METHOD OF MAKING MOTOR STATOR

## Abstract
A method of making a single piece stator 2 for electric motor utilizes a die cavity having a castellated inner surface and radially extending portions along its outer surface. A magnetic material filling the die cavity is sintered after a first densification and prior to a second densification and prior to a second densification, and wire having a heat bondable material over electrical insulation is used to size the interior diameter of the stator.
