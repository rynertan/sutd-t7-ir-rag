# Method for quantitatively determining fat in a fat containing sample.

## Abstract
Fat in a fat containing sample, in particular a milk sample, is determined quantitatively by infra red absorption technique, using as sample waveband a band characteristic to carbon hydrogen bonds, instead of the conventional triglyceride carbonyl band. This avoids the dependency of the measured result on the fat composition of the sample. Influences from other components in the sample are com pensated. A preferred method uses double wavelength determination, with sample wavelength in the interval from 3.475 to 3.51 µm and reference wavelength in the range between 5.51 µm and 3.60 µm. The accompanying drawing shows characteristic trans mission spectra in the wavelength range from 3.3 to 3.6 µm for a fat a double beam balance spectrum of a 3.5 fat milk sample against a skim milk having the same loctose and protein content b protein lactose double beam balance spectrum of skim milk against water and c lactose double beam balance spectrum of 5 lactose solution in water against water . The path length in all three cases was 37 µm.
