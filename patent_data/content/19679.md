# A device for limiting the gas flow in a discharge valve for gas lighters and method of manufacturing the device.

## Abstract
A gas lighter for cigarettes comprise a portion 13 of reduced cross section of the porous dipping element 7 which transfers by capillarity the li quefied gas from the tank to said valve. In this portion the fibers forming the porous dipping element 7 are so compressed with respect to the remainder portion of said porous dipping element 7 as to reduce the gas flow a preset value corresponding to the maximum desired flame height.
