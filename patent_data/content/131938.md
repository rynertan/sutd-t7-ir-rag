# Preparation of elastomeric, chlorosulfonated ethylene polymers.

## Abstract
A process of modifying ethylene polymers by reacting granular ethylene polymers having a density of about 0.87 to about 0.93 gram per cc and a pore volume of about 0.1 to about 1 cc per gram with a gaseous chlorosulfonating agent to produce elastomeric, granular, chlorosulfonated polymers having a tensile modulus of less than about 2,000 psi and a crystallinity of less than about 10 percent.
