## Abstract
A prosthesis 10 for a joint of the human body, such as the metacarpophalangeal, knee, or other joint. The prosth esis 10 includes at least a pair of elongated stem members 12, 14 adapted to be inserted into and bonded on two bones 13, 15 which meet to form the joint. The adjacent surfaces of the two stem members 12, 14 form an interface with each other to present the prosthetic joint interface. The two members 12, 14 are interconnected by a pivot mechanism comprised of a rotatable element 30 in a slot 26 in a first of the stem members 12 , and an L shaped pin 46 pivotally coupled to the element 30 and to the second stem member 14 so that the second stem member 14 can pivot relative to the first stem member 12 about three different axes. The mechanism is made so that the pivotal movement of the second stem member 14 relative to the first stem member 12 about any one of the axes can be accomplished without imparting significant torsional or bending loads to the first stem member 12 . This assures that the first and second stem members 12, 14 remain implanted in the respective bones at all times.

## Description
JOINT PROSTHESIS This invention relates to improvements in prosthetic devices for the joints of the body and, more particularly, to a prosthesis which substantially prevents the transfer of torsional and bending loads from one part to another. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Prosthetic devices adapted to be used at a metacarpophalangeal joint hereinafter MP joint of a human hand are of two general types, namely, those which act as spacers to facilitate biologic reconstruction of a joint out of fibrous scar tissue, and those of more rigid mechanical design which attempt to reconstruct one or several of the axes of motion of the normal MP joint. The former type, illustrated by the Silastic a registered trademark of DOWChemical Company for silicone rubber rubber design ofSwanson hereinafter described , in general, does not place undue stress on the bone and soft tissues into which it isImplanted.The latter type, illustrated by the Steffee andFlatt designs hereinafter described are constructed of metal plastic or metal structures, respectively, are in general prosthetic articulations which are constrained at the junctions of their metacarpal and phalangeal parts in such a manner that they transfer torsional and or bending loads from one part to the other.This results in the parts becoming essentially rigidly coupled together, thereby resulting in mechanical fatigue failure of either the prosthesis itself or the biologic tissue, i.e., bone, into which the prbsthesis is implant d. In addition, . ne of the prostheses currently in use substantially reconstruct he biomechanical mechanisms EErough which the normal W oint moves and dynemically stabilizes itself prosthetic vices or the metacarpophalangeal joint have been devised by a number of Individuals includingFlatt, Swanson, Niebauer, Steffee and Walker.A discussion of the Flatt prosthetic device is found in a textbook entitled, The Care of the Rheumatoid Hand, by Adrian F. Flatt C. V. Mosby Company, St. Louis 1974 pp. 160 166. Flatt s device includes two elongated members for insertion in two adjacent bones of a joint, the members being connected by a single hinge allowing only one degree of freedom of the prosthetic joint. Experience with the Flatt prosthesis has demonstrated either mechanical failure of the prosthesis itself or of the metacarpal and phalangeal bones into which its stems are inserted. The Swanson device is discussed in a text entitled, Flexible Implant Resection Arthroplasty in the Hand andExtremities, by Alfred B. Swanson C.V. Mosby Company,St. louis 1973 Chapter 8, pp. 147 159. This device comrises a one piece member of silicone rubber which allows movement c one mone with respect to the other with multiple degrees of freedom. The flexible implant serves to align the skeletal elements while allowing mechanical motion to occur.Biologic encapsulation together with the structural nature of the implant itself serve to reconstruct motion at the level of the resected joint. In the Swanson design, no discrete axis of motion is reconstructed. Shearing forces and bending moments are Imparted to the prosthesis itself resulting in eventual fatigue failure of a significant number of the implants. The Neibauer device is similar in construction to that of the Swanson device except that the silicone rubber is integral with a fabric belt in the midportion of this onepiece member prosthesis. The narrow midportion junction of the Neibauer prosthesis forms a hinge which reconstructs the flexion extension axis of the joint. Unlike the smooth surfaced Swanson design, the Neibauer design has a fabric weave integral with the surface of the stem portions of the same which facilitates a mechanical bond of the prosthesis to the intramedullary cavities of the adjacent bones. The Steffee design is disclosed by U.S. Patent 3,506,982. This device effectively reconstructs the flexor and extensor moment arms at the level of the MP joint but its mechanical features transfer torsion and bending loads between stem members resulting in either mechanical failure of the prosthesis itself or of its mechanical junction with the adjacent metacarpal and phalangeal bones in a significant number of clinical cases. The Walker design is disclosed in a text entitled, Human Joints and Their Replacements , by Peter S. Walker Charles E. Thomas, Publishers, Springfield, Illinois 1977 .The Walker device comprises a plastic metacarpal stem, metal phalangeal stem, and a snap in plastic axle. The stems have a circular section, with knurling to attach at all points to the cement. The plastic head is part of a sphere, and has a dorsal volar slot to accommodate the metal post. An elongated hole through the side of the plastic head, and a circular hole in the metal post, accommodate the axle. The back of the collar of the phalangeal component is flat to locate against the bone, while at the front, the surface is part of a sphere, of only slightly larger radius of curvature than the plastic head. When the joint is assembled, load bearing occurs between the spherical surfaces and not on the axle.At 0 of flexion, radial ulnar motion is allowed, but progressively with flexion, this lateral motion decreases because the axle is now restrained. Because of the drawbacks of the prosthetic devices of the type described, a need has continued for an improved prosthesis which allows for movement of one bone adjacent to a joint relative to a second bone adjacent to the joint without transfer by the stems of the prosthesis of excessive torsion and bending loads to the second bone. By minimizing these loads, there will be substantially no breaking of the bond between the stem members of the device and the bones or the device itself.In oddi ion, the need also exists for an improved prosthetic design to reconstruct the axes about which the nor . al NP joint moves one of the currently avaIlable prostheses reconstructs the longitudinal rotational axis of the finger as determined by the biomechanics of the normal MP joint. St IJ OF THE INVENTION The present invention satisfIes the aforesaid need bv providing a prosthetic device of improved design which allows one of a pair of relatively shiftable elongated stem members of the device to move relative to the other stem member in three degrees of freedom without transferring any substantial torsional and bending loads to the other member.The foregoing advantages can be realized even though the device can be used in a number of different joints of the body to carrz out the functions of the normal joints which.must be replaced because of rheumatoid arthritis and other artbzltities associated with the joint. To this end, the present invention includes a rotatable element coupled to one of the stem members and an Th shaped pin rnivctallv connecting the element with the second stem member. The axis of rotation of the element with respect to the first stem member provides a first degree of freedom and the axes provided by the elongated parts of theL shaped pin provide second and third degrees of freedom, all of whicfr assure alignment and apposition of the prosthetic articular surfaces throughout a substantially normal range of joint motion of the first member relative to the second member without causing a bending action or a transfer of torsional and bending loads between the stem members. This feature is particularly important in functional hand acting ties in which externally applied forces deviate a finger to either the radial or ulnar side of the hand or force the finger to rotate in a torsional manner, each of which forces should be substantially absorbed, controlled and or dissipated by the ligamentous and musculotendinous soft tissues that have been reconstructed during joint implantation. The linkage mechanism thereof ensures proper alignment and appo sition of the prosthetic articular surfaces essential for transfer of the joint reaction force permitting restricted motion of the first member relative to the second member without causing a bending action or a transfer of substantial torsional and bending loads between the stem members.The device, especially the linkage mechanism thereof, is suitable for implantation in the metacarpolphalangeal knee and wrist joints and can be adapted for use in joints at other parts of the human body. The primary object of this invention is to provide a prosthetic device of improved construction which can be inserted at a joint of the human body in a manner such that the bone at one side of the joint can pivot relative to the sone on the opposite side of the joint without transferring any substantial torsional and bending loads to the bone at the other side of the joint, thereby assuring the continued implantatIon of the device and avoidance of mechanical failure of the device or mechanical breakdown of the bond between the device and the skeletal system. Other objects of this invention will become apparent as the following specification progresses, reference dening had to the accompanying drawings for an embodiment of the invention.IN THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a side elevational view of the prosthesis of the present invention for use with the metacarpophalangeal joint of the human hand, the bones of the joint being shown in cross section Fig. 2 is a top plan view of the prosthesis on a reduced scale from that of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a bottom plan view of the prosthesis on the scale of that shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is an end elevational view of a part of the metacarpal head portion of the prosthesis looking in the direction of the metacarpal base or wrist Fig. 4a is a side elevational view of the pivot mechanism of the prosthesis Fig. 4b is an end elevational view of the rotatable element forming a part of the pivot mechanism of Fig. 4a Fig. 4c is another end elevational view of the rotational element looking from the distal end of the pivot mechanism Fig. 5 is a side elevational view of the bones of a finger showing the metacarpophalangeal joint and the collateral ligaments at such joint Fig. 6 is a view depicting volar dislocation of the proximal phalanx with respect to the metacarpal head with an associated complete tear of the collateral ligaments Fig. 7 is a side elevational view of the right hand of a human, showing the prosthesis in place for the index finger Figs. 8 and 9 are views similar to Fig. 7 but showing a volar subluxation condition and a normal condition, respectively, of the metacarpolphalangeal joint Fig. 9a is a schematic view of the bones of a finger, showing the axes of movement of the finger when the prosthesis is in place Fig. 10a is an end elevational view of a part of the metacarpal head of a normal MP joint showing the extensor and flexor tendon mechanisms and the collateral ligaments looking in the direction of the metacarpal base or wrist Fig. lOb is a view similar to Fig. lox but showing the attenuation of the ligaments that stabilize the flexor and extensor mechanisms Fig. lOc is a view similar to Figs. 10a and lOb but showing a part of the prosthetic metacarpal head of this invention and illustrating its use in reconstructing the flexor and extensor tendon mechanisms and their associated collateral ligaments Fig. 11 is a view similar to Fig. 1 but showing an embodiment of the prosthesis used with the knee joint and Fig. lia is an end elevational view of the rotatable element of the prosthesis of Fig. 11, showing the way in which the patella is coupled therewith. The prosthesis of the present invention is broadly denoted by the numeral 10 and is illustrated in detail inFigs. 1 4 with respect to its use in the metacarpophalangeal joint hereinafter MP joint of a thumb or a finger of the human hand. While the prosthesis of the invention, as illustrated Figs. 1 10 , is suitable for this particular joint, the structural details of the prosthesis, including the unique pivot mechanism thereof, are suitable for use with the knee, elbow, wrist and other body joints as well. In all cases, the prosthesis of the invention is operable to align the skeletal members at a prosthetic joint interface by means of a mechanism that allows the dissipation of torsional loads and bending moments at the level of the joint interface.By doing this, the prosthesis of the present invention avoids the problems of prosthetic joint failure due either to loosening of the prosthesis at its interface with the bone or to mechanical failure of the prosthetic joint itself, both of which are a direct result of transmission of excessive torsional loading and bending moments across the prosthetic articulation. Prosthesis 10 includes a first, elongated member 12 adapted to be coupled with the metacarpal bone 13 of a thumb or finger of the hand, and a second member 14 adapted to be coupled to the proximal phalanx 15 of the finger. The first and second members are coupled together by a pivot mechanism 16 to allow movement of member 14 relative to member 12 in three degrees of freedom which substantially simulate the three degrees of freedom in which the proximal phalanx of a normal finger moves relative to the metacarpal bone 13. Member 12 had a head 17 integral with a stem 19.The shape of the stem is pointed so that it can be inserted into the hollow or medulla of metacarpal bone 13. The stem is bonded in the medullary canal by a currently appropriate clinical technique. In the current state of the art, this would require cementing grouting the stem in the medullary canal by polymethyl methacrylate or by allowing tissue ingrowth into a porous surface of the stem of the prosthesis to thereby interconnect the stem and the metacarpal bone 13.Head 17 simulates the metacarpal head at the iS joint of n normal finger. The outer surface 21 of the head is substantially spherical and extends typically from a location 23 forwardly and upwardly to a location 25 near the top flat surface of member 12. Head 21 has a slot 26 which is open at surface 21 and extends from a location near location 23 to a location identified by the numeral 28 Fig. 1 . The slot 26 is adapted to receive a rotatable element 30 forming one part of pivot mechanism 16, the element being rotatably mounted on head 17 by a pin 32 carried on head 17 at each side of slot 26 so that the element rotates in slot 26 about the axis of pin 32. Element 30 is shown as being disk like in construction, but it can be of any other suitable shape, if desired. The continuation of slot 26 onto surface 21 of head 17 is widest in its volar extent to accommodate for element 33 and is denoted by the numeral 26a in Fig. 4. The dorsal extension of slot 26 narrows to accommodate pin 46 hereinafter described forming pivot mechanism 16 to permit a forced hyperextension of the joint. This dorsal extension of slot oration 20a is denoted by the numeral 26b in Fig. 4.This feature allows hyperextension of the joint without causing a constraint on the same that might transmit undue loads on the bone cement interface on one side of the joint to the bone cement interface on the opposite side of the joint or undue stress on the prosthesis itself. While the shape of prosthetic metacarpal head 17 is stated as being substantially spherical, it is at least partially spherical on its articular surface 21 but essentially it is anatomically the same as the shape of the normal metacarpal head with a portion of its attached collateral ligaments, a shape modified primarily to accommodate for the needs of a mechanical linkage as opposed to a biologic linkage. In the case of the NP joints of the fingers, this shape is most nearly spherical for the ring finger MP joint, with moderate asymmetry of the radial and ulnar sides of the metacarpal head in the case of the long and little fingers, and marked asymmetry of the same sides with respect to the index metacarpal head. This shape allows element 30 to have a projecting part 33 to extend outwardly from surface 21 as shown in Figs. 1 and 4a.Part 30 is provided with a bore 34 therein for receiving a part of pin 46. On each of the dorso radial and dorso ulnar aspects of metacarpal head 17 are provided a pair of open end passages 59 for receiving surgical suture material to re suspend the collateral ligaments during reconstruction of the soft tissues These passages 59 are shown in Figs. 1, 2, 4 and lOc . Member 14 has a stem 36 which is pointed to facili tate its insertion into the hollow or medullary canal of the proximal phalanx 15. The margin of surface 38 of member lt is elevated into a flange 385 Figs. 1 3 to prevent migration o member 14 into the proximal end of phalangeal bone 15. The stem is cemented in place with a suitable bonding mechanism as described above with reference to stem 19 of member 12. Member 14 has a surface 38 which is adjacent to and substantially complemental with, and normally engaging surface 21 of head 17. Also, surface 38 is essentially similar in shape to the proximal articular surface of a normal proximal phalanx.Also member 14 has a bore SO which extends from the volar part 42 to a location near but spaced from the dorsal surface 44 thereof at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis of member 14 as shown in Fig. 1. This bore is adapted to recei ve the above mentioned pin of pivot mechanism 16 and one reason for the angularity of bore 40 is to space the bore a considerable distance away from surface 38 to provide sufficient structural strength for member le when it is mounted on the pin. Pivot mechanism 16 further includes a generallyL shaped pin 46 having a first part 48 rotatably and slidably received within bore 34 and a second part 50 rotatably and slidably received within bore 40. The upper end of pin part 50 bears against or is slightly spaced from the open top of bore 40 as shown in Fig. 1. Also, pin 46 has a shoulder 52 near the junction of parts 48 and 50, the shoulder presenting a bearing surface for engaging the lower face of the volar part 42 of member 14. For purposes of illustration, the bearing surface of shoulder 52 is flat but it could be of another shape, if desired. This limits the downward movement of member 14 on pin 46 and facilitates rotation of member 14 relative to pin 46. By virtue of pivot mechanism 16 defined by pin 46, pin 32 and element 30, member 14 is movable about three degrees of freedom relative to member 12 while keeping the attached skeletal elements, namely metacarpal bone 13 and proximal phalanx 15, properly aligned at their prosthetic joint interfaces in a system that dissipates torsional loading and bending moments while preventing volar, radial or ulnar subluxation of the proximal phalanx with respect to the metacarpal and simultaneously reconstructing the moment arms for the flexor tendons flexor digitorum sublimus and profundus , the tendons of the intrinsic muscles and the entire extensor tendon mechanism at the level of the MP joint.These three degrees of freedom are rotation of member 14 about the longitudinal axis of pin 32, rotation of member 14 about the longitudinal axis of part 48 of pin 46, and rotation of member 14 about the longitudinal axis of part 50 of pin 46. In the case of deviation of the finger, i.e., movement in the radial or ulnar direction, there could be rotation of member 14 about the longitudinal axis of part 50 of pin 46 as well as the concomitant extraction of a portion of pin part 48 from bore 34 while keeping the proper alignment between metacarpal bone 13 and proximal phalanx 15 as appreciated at their prosthetic articular surfaces 21 and 38, respectively. Also, part 48 of pin 46 reconstructs the moment arm system for rotational torsional stability of the finger. In use, the diseased PIP joint of the hand is approached through a dorsal skin incision entering the joint by dividing the transverse lamina of the extensor hood mech . anism by techniques common to the art of surgical reconstruction of this joint. The joint capsule is incised and the metacarpal head is resected at its proximal extent near or at the junction of the metaphyseal flare. Appropriate intramedullary reamers are used to remove the cancellous bone from the intramedullary canal of the metacarpal bone 13. The proximal articular surface of the proximal phalanx is then perforated to facilitate reaming of the medullary canal of the proximal phalanx. A prosthesis is selected appropriate to size and shape for the particular NP joint being replaced.Reaming is continued until stems 19 and 36 can be appropriately accommodated, following which each of such stems are installed in the proper medulla with pin 46 inserted into bores 34 and 40, respectively, to link members 12 and 14 of prosthesis 10. Once the degree of bone resection and skeletal realignment is considered to be adequate, the metacarpal and phalangeal portions are removed and later cemented in place. The remains of the collateral ligaments are advanced dorsally thereby resuspending the flexor tendon mechanism beneath the prosthetic metacarpal head. The dorsal end of the collateral ligaments are then secured to the dorso ulnar and dorso radial aspects of the prosthetic metacarpal head 12 using surgical sutures placed into the same and through the open end passages 59 as depicted inFig. lOc.Scar tissue will eventually encapsulate the various parts of the prosthesis, yet member 14 can continue to move with respect to member 12 about the three degrees of freedom mentioned above. Pivot mechanism 16 of prosthesis 10 serves a number of functions. It replaces the function of the collateral ligaments which are typically attenuated or destroyed in rheumatoid arthritis and or other arthritities of the MP joint. In such a clinical situation, there is a volar subluxation or dislocation of the base of the proximal phalanx with respect to the metacarpal head. This is illustrated inFigs. 5 and 6 in which Fig. 5 shows a normal finger andFig. 6 shows the condition known as volar dislocation. InFig. 5, the collateral ligaments properly align metacarpal bone 13 with proximal phalanx 15. The anatomical disposition of the fibers of the collateral ligaments prevents volar subluxation of the base of the proximal phalanx on the metacarpal head by virtue of their oblique course from the dorsal aspect of the metacarpal head to the volar base of the proxi mal phalanx. This is most important in opposing the dislocating forces of the flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor digitorum sublimus tendons together with the forces of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. The glenoidal portion of the collateral ligaments 55 is responsible for suspending the flexor tendon pulley or tunnel 54 Figs. 9 and 10a appropriately in a normal finger immediately beneath the volar aspect of the NP joint thereby assuring the proper moment arm for the flexor tendons at the level of the MP joint. In Figs. 8 and lOb, a progressive degree of attenuation of the two portions of the collateral ligaments on either side of the NP joint results in progressive degrees of subluxation of the base of proximal phalanx 15 on the metacarpal head leading to joint subluxation of the same as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 6 shows advanced attenuation of the ligaments with secondary dislocation of proximal phalanx 15 with respect to metacarpal 13.Progressive degrees of subluxation corresponding to lesser amounts of NP joint collateral ligament attenuation can exist. Each increment of volar subluxation of the base of the proximal phalanx on the metacarpal head results in a concomitant increase in the mechanical advantage of the flexor tendons 56 Figs. 7 9 and lOb to flex the NP joint due to the progressive increase in the distance between the axis of flexion and extension of the NP joint and the powerful flexor tendons 56. This increased mechanical advantage is shown in Fig. 8 in which a condition of volar subluxation is shown although not to the extent of that shown in Fig. 6. When properly installed at the interface between metacarpal bone 13 and proximal phalanx 15, prosthesis 10 returns toward normal the moment arms of the flexor and extensor tendons with respect to the biomechanical Instant center of the MP joint for flexion and extension as reconstructed by prosthesis 10. In the design of prosthesis 10, the proper balance between flexor and extensor forces acting on the implanted prosthesis is defined by two interdependent mechanical factors 1. The gliding motion of articular surface 38 of member 14 on the semispherical articular surface 21 of member 12 which defines a flexion extension axis slightly dorsal to pin 32. 2. The mechanical suspension of pivot mechanism 16 by pin 32 which resists the volar subluxing forces of the flexor tendons and intrinsic muscles as it reconstructs the function of the collateral ligaments thereby preventing volar subluxation of the base of the proximal phalanx with respect to the metacarpal head. By adjusting the semispherical shape of the prosthetic metacarpal head 25 together with the position of pin 32, a balance of the flexor and extensor forces can be achieved. The dorso volar position or axis 32 is depicted by distances x and y in Fig. 4. This need for balancing the flexor and extensor forces at Mr joint level is a recognized mechanical need of a prosthetic joint and is extremely important to the design of a prosthesis for the IAP joint. In the design of prosthesis 10 for use in the IvtP joint of the human hand, element 30 is shorter in vertical height from the dorsal aspect to the volar aspect of head 17 as seen in Fig. 4 such that the lower part or aspect of element 30 aligns with the lower end of head 17, the upper end of element 30 being spaced below the dorsal extent of head 17, thereby positioning the flexion extension axis pin 32 more than 50 perhaps 60 to 70 of the way from the dorsal to the volar side of the prosthesis while assuring a smooth dorsal and distal aspect of metacarpal head 17 for the extensor tendon and its intimately associated extensor hood mechanism to glide upon. A typically progressive volar subluxation of the proximal phalanx on the metacarpal head is accompanied by progressive degrees of dislocation of the extensor tendon from the dorsal aspect of the metacarpal head to the ulnar side of the NP joint. This results in a progressive decrease in the moment arm of the extensor tendon and or its i1 y to extend the NP joint and balance the flexor forces generated by the progressively more mechanically advantages flexor tendons.Also, the progressive attenuation of the collateral ligaments typically allows the flexor and extensor tendons to l bow string across the ulnar aspect of the NP joint, as depicted in Fig. 10b thereby producing an ulnar deviating force on the proximal phalanx with respect to the metacarpal head. This patho mechanical mechanism is responsible for the progressive ulnar drift in the fingers in rheumatoid arthritis of the MP joint.Pivot mechanism 16, when properly linking members 12 and lt, not only realigns the base of the proximal phalanx with metacarpal head 17 to reconstruct the moment arms of the extensor and flexor tendons, but together with surgical soft tissue reconstruction, It also realigns the flexor and extensor tendons with respect to their patho logically altered moment arms as shown in Fig. lOc for ulnar deviation of the proximal phalanx at the MP joint. This is achieved notwithstanding the degree of deterioration of the collateral ligaments. Pivot mechanism 16 also reconstructs the longitudi ral rotational axis of the finger at the level of the . tS As As shown in Figs. 9 and 10a, the normal MP joint has flexor tendons 56 contained in pulley tunnel 54 which extends longitudinally under and adjacent to the volar aspect of the NP joint. Flexor tendons 56 and tunnel 54 define the longi tudlnal rotational axis of the NP joint in progressive degrees of flexion of the same as when the tip of the finger is in contact with the distal end of the thumb. During functional use of the finger, flexor tendons 56 are under marked tension and are contained tightly in tunnel 54. This pulley tunnel, which extends from the proximal extent of head 17 to the volar aspect of proximal phalanx 15 distally constitutes a longitudinal bearing for flexor tendons 56 which are under tension and thereby jointly define the longitudinal rotational axis of the finger at the level of the NP joint which is in any of anumber of degrees of flexion. When the MP joint is extended, the collateral ligaments are relatively relaxed, thereby allowing the base of the proximal phalanx to migrate to the radial or ulnar side of the metacarpal head without obligating itself to a significant degree of longitudinal rotation. This varies with the joint and the particular patient.With progressive degrees of flexion, from about 300 to 900, the cam like effect of the metacarpal head makes the collateral ligaments tighten, thereby snugly securing the fibro cartilagenous portion of tunnel 54 just volar to the metacarpal head, obligating the base of the proximal phalanx and thereby the entire finger to rotate about the dorsal aspect of tendons 56 and their tunnel 54. A significant aspect of this issue is that the same pathological process which attenuates the collateral ligaments, thereby permitting progressive degrees of volar sub luxation of the base of the proximal phalanx, also destroys the ability of the proximal portion of tunnel 54 to act as a bearing for the rotational axis of the finger. Each of the intrinsic muscles, i.e. the interossei and lumbricals, and the extensor tendons, together with the entire extensor hood mechanism, have moment arms that relate to this longitudinal rotational axis of the finger. The dorsal to volar depth x plus y of Fig. 4 of the i joint is the moment arm about which the extensor tendon and the entire extensor hood mechanism acts to achieve rotational stability of the finger.The extensor tendon acts on the dorsal and proximal extents of the extensor hood mechanism, thereby rotating a typical index finger into supination by virtue of forces transmitted in a circular fashion about the NP joint through the extensor hood mechanism. Similar forces are derived from the extensor tendon mechanism to the long, ring and little fingers by virtue of the varying angles of approach of the junctura tendons. Pivot mechanism IC, while functioning to prevent volar subluxation of the proxl,. l phalanx on the metacarpal head, also assures that the intrinsic muscles of the hand will be provided with the proper moment arms for radial ulnar deviation of the finger about an anterior posterior axis. In the normal finger MP joint in the extended position this radlal ulnar deviation occurs about an axis passing through the metacarpal head.Progressive degrees of joint flexion in the normal j joint results in elimination of radial and ulnar displacement of the distal end of the finger as the intrinsic interosseous muscles change from a function of radial ulnar deviation to a function of rotation of the entire finger.Because they are rotators of the finger, the Interossel also acting on a flexed NP joint are torsional stabilizers of the tinges. Most importantly, pivot mechanism 16 jointly provides for the proper moment arms of the intrinsic muscles to radially and ulnarally deviate the extended finger or rotate or torsionally stabilize the flexed finger. Both of these motions occur about vertical part 50 of pin 46, it being noted that radial or ulnar deviation of member 1 not accom paniced by rotation of part 14 results In extraction of part 48 of pin 46 from bore 34. When prosthesis 10 is In place, part 8 of pin 46 will be generally at an angle of 300 to 350 with re erence to the longitudinal axis of proximal phalanx 15 when the latter is extended as shown in Fig. 1. This allows part 50 of pin 46 to be at an angle of about 600 to the longitudInal axis o proximal phalanx 15. The three degrees of freedom provided by prosthesis 10 for a finger relative to the lS joint can be illustrated with reference to the finger shown in Fig. 9a. in this figure, the finger can have flexion extenslon movement about a first axis pin 32 perpenaicular to the figure. h second degree of freedom is provided by the movement of the finger about the longitudinal axis 48a cf part 48 of pin 46, i.e., the longitudinal rotation of the finger relative to the joint. Axis 48a is essentially parallel to the rotation axis 56a of the normal finger, axis 56a normally passing obliquely through tunnel 54 and flexor tendons 56 of the normal finger.A third degree of freedom Is provided by the radial ulnar movement of the finger about the longitudinal axis 50a of part 50 of pin 46, axis 50a being angularly disposed relative to shaft 32 and part 8. Axis 50a is spaced from the axis 60 Fig. 9a about which radial ulnar deviation of the normal finger occurs. Most importantly, divot mechanism 16 of prosthesis 10 provides the foregoing degrees of freedom and the foregoing functions while dissipating torsional loading of the joint surface and dissipating bending moments at the level of the joint. Each of these features diminishes or substantially eliminates any stress transmitted to the interface between each of stems 19 and 36 and its respective medulla, thereby assuring that the prosthesis will remain properly implanted at all times notwithstanding the freedom of movement of the finger relative to the NP joint. During radial and ulnar deviation of the proximal phalanx 15 relative to head 17 when prosthesis 10 is in place, there can be and generally is a progressive extraction of part 48 from bore 34 in the volar extent of element 30.Also, hyperextension forces of the prosthesis allow the distal end of part 48 of pin 46 to move dorsally in slot 26, the width of portion 26b of slot 26 being slightly wider than the transverse dimension of part 48 of pin 46 as shown inFig. 4. While parts 48 and 50 of pin 46 have been shown to be at right angles to each other, they can be slightly or moderately greater or less than 900 from each other to minimize stress or wear at the interfaces of these parts with members 12 and 14. Pins 32 and 46 and member 12 will generally be metallic and member 14 and element 30 will generally be of plastic material so that there will be no metal tometal contact between adjacent parts it is understood however that the prosthesis could be constructed of other matervials such as ceramics. Also, the shape of pin 46 can be changed with reference to members 12 and 14. Specifically, part 48 of pin 46 is generally parallel to and above tunnel 54 of flexor tendons 56 of the finger when the prosthesis is in place. This allows also for a more volar placement of the junction of the two parts of pin 46 and diminishes the dorsal extent of the open section in the distal end of head 17 while increasing the amount Ol material available in the proximal end of member 14 for pin part 50 to be placed in. The shape of head 17 of member 12 can be varied and might be different in shape for each of the fingers and thumb. In each instance, the essence of the shape and size will nearly reproduce the normal metacarpal head with its attached collateral ligaments as these ligaments are quite bulky and, collectively with the normal metacarpal head, give the fInished semi spherical shape to the same. Also, stem 19 of member 12 for the index finger will generally have a different angle than that for the long finger, and stem 19 of member 12 designed for the ring finger will be essentially straight without being angled.Specific angles for members 12 of the various prostheses for the various fingers can be determines by measurements of specific hands. Also, element 30 should have its flexion extension axis generally perpen dlcular to the longitudinal axis of the proximal phalanx, and the plane of element 30 should be generally perpendicular to the flexion extension axis of the MP joint.Projection 33 of element 30 is provide to minimize the length of part 8 of pin 46 that is exposed to bending moments induced by the volar Subl ating forces of the flexor tendons on the proximal phalanx. The adaption of trite prosthesis of this invention for use in the knee joint is depicted in Fig. 11 which shows a side elevational view of the prosthesis 110. This prosthesis has stem members 119 and 136 with end faces 121 and 138, respectively, and a pivot mechanism comprised of a rotatable element 130 coupled by a pin or shaft 132 to the head 116 at one end of member 119. An L shaped pin 146 having parts 148 and 150 pivotally interconnects member 136 with element 130 in tne same manner as described above with respect to prosthesis 10. Element 130 is of similar height to the prosthetic femoral condyles 117 in such a manner that the periphery of a disc like version of element 130 presents itself anteriorly so that it can have a groove 179 to accept the deep surface 182 of the patella 181 as seen in Fig. lla. During flexion and extension of the knee, the patella rides in groove 179 or other suitable receptacle on the anterior surface of the generally disc shaped element 130 in such a manner that it transfers the Jjoint reaction force which normally occurs between the patella and the femoral condyles to the çlexion extension axis pin 132. Groove 179 thereby reconstructs the patello femoral joint of the knee.In addition, part 148 of pin 146 reconstructs the longitudinal rotational axis of the knee joint in a manner analogous to the way part 48 of pin 46 reconstructs the longitudinal rotational axis of the NP joint. The x and y distances shown in Fig. 11 are substantially equal to each other in contrast to the cor sponaing distances for prosthesis 10. As in the concept of the present invention for the NP joint of the hand, the ability of the pivot mechanism to dissipate torsional and bending moments from the prosthesis and its interface with the bone assures the continued successful implantation of the same. While the invention as described in Figs. 1 4 is applied to the tP joint of the human hand and in Fig. 11 is applied to the knee, it is understood that the knee version is suitable for application to the NP joint of the finger and that, in such a case, rotatable element 130 which is shown inFig. 11 as being notched on its anterior aspect to receive the deep aspect 182 of the patella 181 would also serve to receive the extensor tendon to the finger at the level of the NP joint, thereby serving to help stabilize and centralize the extensor tendon over the doral aspect of the MP joint. Similarly, the present invention as shown in Figs. 1 for use in the NP joint of the finger is also suitable for prosthetic replacement of the knee joint, under which circum stances surface 25 of stem member 12 is grooved which groove extends from surface 25 onto surface 21, thereby notching the dorsal and distal surface of the same to receive the generally pointed and convex deep surface 182 of the patella.
