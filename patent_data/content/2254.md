# Preparation of N aminomethyl alpha,beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxamides, their polymers and the quaternized carboxamides thereof.

## Abstract
N aminomethyl α,β ethylenically unsaturated cationic carboxamides such as N dimethylaminomethyl acrylamide are readily prepared without coincident production of saturated impurities by reacting and α,β ethylenically unsaturated carboxamide such as acrylamide with a lower aldehyde such as formaldehyde and a secondary amine such as dimethylamine at a pH below 7. The resulting aminomethyl carboxamides are polymerized at a pH of 7 or less to form polymers containing essentially no gelled product. The resulting aminomethyl carboxamides can also be quaternized by reacting them with a quaternizing agent at a pH below 7. This quaternized products can be polymerized. The polymerisation products are flocculants.
