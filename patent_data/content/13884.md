# Phase locked oscillator circuit and system for generating a clock signal using this circuit.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a system for generating clock signals from a source signal having two harmonically related and phase coherent frequencies. The clock system employs a pair of synchronous demodulators 30, 31 for generating a phase error signal to control a voltage control led oscillator 50 VCO . The source signal is applied to the pair of synchronous demodulators, each of which is sup plied with a different carrier frequency. The output of each demodulator represents the area of the signal being demo dulated. The output of each demodulator is zero and a null condition exists when the system is in a phase locked condition. At a non locked condition, the output of one demodulator has multiple null points. The function of the second demodulator is to resolve the ambiguity between the desired and undesired null points. Carrier signals f and f 3 are generated under control of the VCO by dividing the output of the VCO signal to obtain carrier signals having the appropriate relationship to the source signal.
