## Description
Electrical connecting means and an electric motor stator assembly. This invention concerns the art of making line connections and relates in particular to electrical connecting means especially, but not exclusively, for use in an electric motor stator assembly. The invention also relates in particular to an electric motor stator assembly. We have described in our United StatesPatent Specification No. 3,979,615 electrical connecting means comprising insulating housing means defining first, second and third terminal receiving cavities, each cavity communicating with a wire admitting slot, first second and third electrical terminals each comprising a plate having a wire receiving slot therein and being insertabls into a respective one of the cavities so as to force into the wire receiving slot of the terminal a wire end extending through the wireadmitting slot of the cavity and across such cavity, to make electrical connection between the terminal and such wire. Although such connecting means have been usefully applied to the manufacture of electric motors of various types and to the manufacture of induction coils, it has not hitherto been found practicable to use such connecting means in the stator assemblies of conventional electric induction motors, because of the confined space that is available in the housings of such motors and because of the disparity between the gauges of the main and the auxiliary windings thereof.According to current practice in the manufacture of electric induction motors, the ends of the windings are connected to leads by means of crimped splice connections which have subsequently to be insulated and buried in the windings prior to the stator assembly being resin dipped and thereafter baked to cure the resin so that the assembly is ready to be assembled to the motor housing. According to one aspect of the invention, electrical connecting means as defined in the second paragraph of this specification are characterised in that each plate has first and second juxtaposed wire receiving slots, the first wire receiving slot being dimensioned to receive a first wire of a first gauge and the second wire receiving slot being dimensioned to receive a second wire of a second gauge, the third cavity having first and second juxtaposed wire admitting slots communicating therewith, the first wire admitting slot being dimensioned to receive a wire of the second gauge but not a wire of the first gauge, the first, second and third terminals having thereon, means for connecting them respective first, second and third electrical leads, whereby upon positioning one end of the first wire in the wire admitting slot of the first cavity, which slot is dimensioned to receive a wire of the second gauge but not a wire of the first gauge, positioning one end of the second wire in the wire admitting slot of the second cavity and positioning the other ends of the first and second wires in the respective first and second wire admitting slots of the third cavity and thereafter inserting each of the terminals into a respective one of the cavities, the ends of first and second wires are connected to the terminals. Such electrical connecting means can be mounted on the stator after it has been resin dipped and baked so that the ends of the windings can be connected to the leads immediately prior to the assembly of the stator to the motor housing.It is an important advantage of the connecting means that the terminals can be identical despite the disparity in gauge between the main and the auxiliary windings. Manufacture is also simplified in that the terminals can only be inserted into their cavities with the correct orientation relative thereto. According to another aspect of the invention, an electric motor stator assembly comprising a stator having winding, and an insulating terminal housing mounted on a face of the stator, the housing having a base adjacent to the stator and a terminal receiving side into which extend first, second and third terminal cavities each such cavity having a wire admitting slot communicating therewith and receiving an end of one of the windings, each such end being wedged in a wirereceiving slot of an electrical terminal in the cavity and each such terminal being connected to a lead of the stator is characterised in that the stator has main and auxiliary windings of different gauge and each terminal has first and second wirereceiving slots dimensioned to receive an end of the main winding and an end of the auxiliary winding, respectively, the first slot of the terminal in the first cavity and the first slot of the terminal in the third cavity, each receiving a respective end of the main winding and the second slot of the terminal in the second cavity and the second slot of the terminal in the third cavity each receiving an end of the auxiliary winding, each cavity having a wire admitting slot opposite to each wirereceiving slot of the terminal in such cavity.The state of the art is further exemplified by the following United States Patent Specifications Nos.2,802,958, 3,457,442, 3,793,611, and 3,869,190. For a better understanding of the invention, embodiments thereof will now be described by way of example with reference to the aCcompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagram showing part of the windings of an electric induction motor Figure 2 is a perspective view of a first stator assembly for an electric induction motor and a housing for the stator assembly Figure 3 is an enlarged perspective view of an electrical terminal housing of the assembly Figure 4 is a diagrammatic top plan view of the stator assembly disposed in its housing Figure 5 is a diagrammatic top plan view illustrating a modification of the stator assembly Figure 6 is an enlarged perspective view of an electrical terminal of the stator assembly Figure 7 is an exploded perspective view of a second stator assembly for an electric induction motor, the assembly incorporating a thermal protector for the motor Figure 8 is a perspective view of the assembly of Figure 7 Figure 9 is an exploded perspective view showing an electrical terminal housing and the thermal protector, of the assembly of Figures 7 and 8 Figure 10 is a fragmentary sectional view of the assembly of Figures 7 and 8 showing the manner in which the thermal protector is positioned therein, Figure 11 is a fragmentary sectional view taken on the lines XI XI of Figure 10 Figure 12 is an enlarged perspective view of an electrical terminal of the assembly ofFigures 7 and 8 Figure 13 is a fragmentary sectional view taken through a cavity of the terminal housing of the assembly of Figures 7 and 8, showing a terminal in such housing connected to a wire and Figure 14 is a circuit diagram of the assembly of Figures 7 and 8. As shown in Figure 2, the stator 6 of a typical single phase electric induction motor comprises a stack of identical mated stamping, welded or otherwise secured to each other. The stator has an upper face 8, a lower face 10, a circumferential surface 12 and a central opening, as shown. Spaced teeth 3 extend inwardly into the control opening and the turns of main and anxiliary windings 2 and 4 extend through the gaps between selected adjacent teeth 3. Ordinarily, the main winding 2 is of larger gauge than the auxiliary winding 4, the wires of both of the windings 2 and 4 being provided with varnish insulation for example, of polyvinyl formal resin. The surface 12 has arcuate portions 14 at evenly spaced intervals, these arcuate portions alternating with flat portions 16. The stator 6 in the completed motor is contained in a cylindrical stator housing 18 having a continuous surface 20 against which the arcuate portions 14 bear en the stator is disposed in the housing 18. The arrangement of the surface portions 14 against the surface 20 provides for good heat transfer and heat dissipation and minimizes the outside dimensions of the motor. As shown in Figure 1, one end 2 of the main winding 2 is connected by means of a terminal 34 to a lead wire 24, one end 4 of the auxiliary winding 4 being connected to a lead wire 28 by means of another electrical terminal 34. The other ends 2 and 4 of the main and auxiliary windings, respectively, are commonly connected to a further terminal 34 which is connected in turn to a lead wire 30. All of the lead wires, 24, 28 and 30 are terminated by flag type quick disconnect terminals 32 by way of crimping ferrules 40 crimped to these lead wires. As shown in Figure 6, each terminal 34, the three terminals 34 being identical, comprises a pair of plates 25 and 27 connected by a web 29 and being spaced from one another by a cross plate 31 which serves to stabilize and rigidify the terminal. First and second wire receiving slots 36 and 38 respectively, extend through the web 29 and into the plates 25 and 27. The first slots 36 are dimensioned to receive the wire of the main winding 2 and the second slots 38 to receive the wire of the auxiliary winding 4, each slot 36 and 38 being dimensioned relative to its respective wire so that when the wire has been forced into the slot the walls thereof pierce the varnish insulation to make electrical contact with the wire. Each plate 25 and 27 is provided with a retention barb 33 at each end thereof.The crimping ferrule 40 is formed integrally with the plate 27 being connected thereto by a neck portion 41, the cross plate 31 being formed integrally with the plate 25. As shown in Figure 3, an overall rectangular insulating housing 42 has a terminalreceiving side 46 and a base 43 which is parallel to, and spaced from, the side 46. Side walls 48 and 50 and end walls 52 extend between the faces 43 and 46, cavities 54, 56 and 58 extending into the housing 42 from the terminal receiving side 46.These cavities are each dimensioned to receive a terminal 34. Adjacent cavities are separated from each other by barrier walls 60. Aligned wireadmitting slots 62 provided in the side walls 48 and 50 in communication with the cavity 54, are dimensioned to receive the relatively large gauge wire of the main winding 2. Aligned wireadmitting slots 64 in the side walls 48 and 59 opening into the cavity 56 are dimensioned to receive the smaller gauge wire of the auxiliary winding 4. Two pairs of aligned wire admitting slots 66 and 68 in the side walls, communicate with and open into the centre cavity 58, the slot 68 being dimensioned to receive the end 2 of the main winding 2 and the slot 66 to receive the end 4 of the auxiliary winding 4.After the wires of the windings 2 and 4 have been positioned in the wire admitting slots according to the wiring pattern of Figure 1, the terminals 34 are inserted into the respective cavities 54, 56 and 58, to lodge the ends of the wires in the slots 36 and 38 of the terminals 34 so that the walls of these slots establish electrical contact with the wires of the windings 2 and 4. In carrying out this wiring operation, the one end 2 of the wining 2 is positioned in the slots 62, the one end 4 of the winding 4, in the slots 64, the remaining ends 2 and 4 of these windings being positioned in the slots 68 and 66, respectively, as shown in Figure 2. A mounting 44 on the housing 42 comprises arms 70 which extend from the end walls 52 of the housing 42, parallel legs 72 which extend downwardly, as seen in Figure 3, and away from the housing 42, and a strut 74 extending between the ends of the legs 72, but being offset from the housing 42 as shown at 76, so as to permit manufacture of the housing 42 and its mounting 44 as a simple injection moulding using core pins and mould parts which move in only one direction, it being unnecessary to use core pins which move laterally of the legs 72. A boss 71 is provided on the upwardly as seen in Figure 3 surface of the strut 74. In use, and when it is desired to connect the ends 2 , 2 , 4 and 4 of the winding 2 and 4 to the lead wires 24, 28, 30 it is merely necessary to place the housing 42 on the stator 6 with the base 43 of the housing 42 on the face 8 of the stator, the legs 72 extending across a pair of the portions 16 of the circumferential surface 12, which portions 16 lie on each side of one of the arcuate portions 14 of the surface 12.The ends of the windings 2 and 4 are then positioned as described above, in the wire admitting slots 62, 64, 66 and 68 and the terminals 34 having the lead wires 24, 28 and 30 crimped thereto are inserted into the cavities 54, 56 and 58 to be retained therein by the lances 33. The stator 6 is then assembled to the housing 18 as shown in Figure 4.The assembled stator and housing can then be carried to a subsequent work station for insertion of the rotor of the electric motor into the central opening of the stator. It will be apparent that by virtue of the relative arrangement of the wire admitting slots of the housing and the wire receiving slots of the terminals 34, the terminals can be inserted into the cavities only with such orientation as correctly to connect the wires, albeit that the terminals 34 are identical. It is desirable to dimension the mounting 44 so that the front edges 73 of the legs 72 bear against the internal surface 20 of the housing 18, the distance between the edges 73 being slightly greater than the chordal distance between the lines of contact between the edges 73 and the surface 20. In such case, the legs 72 and the end portions of the arms 70 and of the strut 74 are flexed, as indicated at 75 in Figure 4, in the case of the arms 70. The housing 42 is thereby firmly clamped to the face 8 of the stator 6. This mounting arrangement ensures that the electrical connections between the windings 2 and 4 and the terminals 34 will not be subjected to damage by vibration or shock when the motor is in use. The boss 71 on the strut 74 is provided in order to permit the mounting 44 to be mounted on stators the thickness of which lies within a certain range of thicknesses, since the manufacturing specifications for motor stators permit a somewhat wide tolerance in the thickness of the stack of laminae. Such wide tolerance is necessary because the thickness of the stator is equal to the sum of the thicknesses of all of the individual laminae in the stator and may also be influenced to some extent by the condition of the surfaces of the laminae. It is not uncommon, for example, for a manufacturing specification to permit a variation of as much as 1.27 mm in the stator thickness where the desired thickness is about 3.175 cm.The boss 71 should therefore be dimensioned so that it will bear against the lower as seen in Figure 2 face 10 of a stator 6 which lies at the lower end of the acceptable tolerance range for the stator thickness. The mounting 44 is deformed when the housing 42 is mounted on a stator having a thickness equal to the upper limit of the tolerance range. The deformation of the mounting 44 is absorbed by the strut 74 and may also be absorbed by the legs 72 and the arms 70. The housing and its mounting should therefore be of a material which is capable of undergoing such deformation. This material may be, for example, an unfilled nylon which is relatively firm when it is in thick sections but which will withstand flexure when it is in relatively thin elongate sections. The stator 6 is dipped in resin and is baked, prior to the assembly of the housing 42 to the stator. The assembly of the housing 42 to the stator, the positioning of the ends of the windings in the housing 42, and insertion of the terminals 34 into the cavities of the housing 42, can be carried out as a series of closely consecutive steps and the stator is not subjected to extensive handling after the electrical connections have been made. Such a method of assembly is economical of labour and the stator reject rate is low. The stator shown in Figure 5 has cylindrical surface 82 for location against the surface 20 of housing. In this case it is merely necessary to provide in the surface 82 spaced apart notches 80 having parallel surfaces 81, for receiving the legs 72 of the mounting 44. Further notches 84 may be provided adjacent to the notches 80 so as to allow the arms 70 to flex as described above with reference to Figure 4. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, the stator 102 of a typical split phase two pole electric induction motor comprises a substantially circular stack 104 of laminae, having an upper face 106, and a lower face 107, as seen in Figures 7 and 8.A plurality of spaced apart teeth 108 extend inwardly towards the centre of the stator 2 into a central opening thereof. An auxiliary stator winding 114 extends between selected adjacent teeth 108 and beyond the faces 106 and 107, as shown. A main stator winding 110 is of larger gauge than the auxiliary winding 114. The ends 112, 112 , and 116, 116 of the main and auxiliary windings, respectively, are located adjacent to a threaded hole 105 in the upper surface 106 of the stator 102 preparatory to these ends being connected to lead wires as described below. The connections to the ends 112, 112 , 116, 116 of the windings, comprise a first lead consisting of two wires 118 and 120 commonly connected to a terminal 168 1, a second lead consisting of a single wire 122 which is connected to a terminal 168 2, a third lead consisting of a single wire 124 which is connected to a terminal 168 3, and a fourth lead consisting of two wires 128 and 130 which are connected to a terminal 168 4. All four terminals 168 are identical. The wires 124 and 128 extend from the cylindrical body of a thermal protector 126 for the motor. Such protectors comprise a normally closed switch which automatically opens in response to a rise in the motor temperature above a predetermined value and which automatically closes when the temperature returns to the predetermined value.An additional electrical connection may be required in the form of a ground wire 132 which terminates in a ring tongue terminal 134 connected to the stator 102 by a fastener, as described below. A terminal housing 136 of insulating material, preferably a moulded thermo plastics material for example nylon, is generally V shaped as seen in plan view comprising divergent arms 138 and 140 which extend from an enlarged centre portion 142.As best seen in Figure 9 each of the arms 138 and 140 has a terminal receiving, upper side 144, as seen in Figure 9, front and rear side walls 146 and 148, end walls 150 and a base surface 151.First, second, third and fourth cavities 152, 154, 156 and 158, respectively, extend into the sides 144 of the arms 138 and 140 as shown . The first cavity 152 is adjacent to the outer end of the arm 138, the second cavity 154 being adjacent to the outer end of the arm 140, and third cavity 156 extending into the arm 140 adjacent to the centre portion 142, and the fourth cavity 158 extending into the arm 138 adjacent to the centre portion 142. Pairs of opposed wire admitting slots 160, 162, 164 and 166 are provided in the side walls 146 and 148 to permit of the ends 112, 112 , 116 and 116 of. the windings to be arranged selectively in the first, second and third cavities 152, 154 and 156, respectively. The slots 160 of the cavity 152 are dimensioned in width to receive the end 112 of the main winding 110, the slots 162 of the cavity 154 being dimensioned in width to receive the end 116 of the auxiliary winding 114. The slots 162 cannot, however, receive either end 112 or 112 of the main winding 110. The slots 162 are of a reduced width at their lower as seen in Figure 9 portions to achieve such selective admission of the ends 116 and 116 of the winding 114.Of the pairs of slots 164 and 166 provided for the third cavity 156, the slots 164 are dimensioned to receive the end 112 and the main winding 110, slots 166 being dimensioned to receive only the end 116 of the auxiliary winding 114. As shown inFigure 13, each of the cavities has a wire supporting boss 167 extending outwardly from its base. As shown in Figure 12, each terminal 168 comprises a web 170 from which extend parallel plates 172 and 174 to provide a substantiallyU shaped structure. A neck portion 176 extending from the plate 172 carries a crimping ferrule 178 for electrically and mechanically connecting the terminal to its lead wire. A cross plate 180 extends inwardly from the free edge of the plate 174 towards the plate 172. wire receiving slots 182 and 184 extend through the web 170 and into the plates 172 and 174, the slot 182 being of a width to receive, and establish electrical contact with, either of the ends 116 or 116 of the auxiliary winding 114, whilst the slot 184 is dimensioned to receive either of the ends 112 or 112 of the main winding 110.A central slot 183 disposed between, and being deeper than, the slots 182 and 184 serves to separate the spring systems provided by the two wire receiving slots 182 and 184 but is not itself intended to receive a wire. Each plate 172 and 174 is provided with a retention lance 169 at each end thereof. Each of the slots 182 and 184 has associated shear lines 179 and 181, the former extending from the edges of the slot laterally away therefrom and the sher line 181 extending from the outer end of the shear line 179 parallel to the slot and towards its base. During manufacture, the terminal is sheared along the lines 179 and 181 and the material bounded by these shear lines is bent out of the plane of the blank from which the terminal is to be formed, the bent out material being then bent back into the plane of the blank, in such a way that a shoulder is formed on each edge of each slot, which shoulder faces downardly as seen in Figure 12 and towards the wire receiving end of the slot. The shoulders thus produced provide edges which cut into or penetrate the varnish insulation of a wire as it is moved into the slot. Each terminal 168 can be inserted into a cavity 152, 154, 156 or 158 only in one orientation of the terminal, the wire admitting slots 160, 162, 164 and 166 in the housing 136 being so located that the appropriate wire receiving slot 182 or 184, will receive the wire which is positioned in a particular cavity. The cavity 158 has no associated wireadmitting slot although it receives the terminal 168 4. This terminal serves primarily as a strain relief member for the wire 128 which extends from the protector 126, so that tensile forces applied to the wire 130 are not transmitted through the wire 128 to the protector 126. The central portion 142 of the housing 136 has a pair of columns 186 upstanding from its upper as seen in Figure 9 surface 185, opposed surfaces of the columns 186 being provided with arcuate cross section grooves 188 dimensioned to receive there between the housing of the protector 126. A recess 190 in the central portion 142 has in its base, an opening for accommodating a screw 192 see Figure 7 . The housing 136 is assembled to the stator 102 after the latter has been dipped in a polymeric material and baked at an elevated temperature to cure the polymer. After the baking step, the ends 112, 112 , and 116, 116 of the windings 110 and 114 are located as shown in Figure 7 adjacent to the threaded opening 105 in the surface 106 of the stator 102. The ring tongue terminal 134 is located in alignment with the opening 105 and the housing 136 is then positioned on the surface 106 and is secured thereto by means of the screw 192 so that the wire 132 of the stator is grounded.Thereafter, the end 112 of the winding 110 is positioned in the slots 160, the end 116 of the winding 114 is positioned in the slots 162, and the remaining ends 112 , 116 of these windings are positioned in the appropriate slots 164 and 166, each wire end resting upon a support boss 167 in its respective cavity. The terminals 168 are then inserted into the appropriate cavities 152, 154, 156 and 158 to be retained therein by the lances 169, so that the terminals and the lead wires are thereby connected to the appropriate ends of the stator windings. As will be apparent from Figure 13, each wire end is supported by the boss 167 in its cavity, in such a way that when the appropriate terminal 168 is inserted into the cavity the wire end is received in a wire receiving slot of the terminal.Thus, the end 112 of the main winding 110 is connected to the terminal 168 1 and thereby to the wires 118, 120, the end 116 of the auxiliary winding 114 is connected to the terminal 168 2 and thus to the wire 122, and the remaining ends 112 , 116 of the windings are commonly connected to the terminal 168 3 and thus to the wire 124 which extends from the protector 126. The protector 126 is thereafter positioned between the columns 186 so that as shown in Figures 10 and 11, the protector 126 lies beneath a portion 194 of the auxiliary winding 114. As shown in Figure 10, a motor housing 196 is finally positioned so as to cover the housing 136 and the protector 126. The stator assembly is shown in its fully assembled condition in Figure 8, but without the motor housing 136. The circuit of a typical split phase twopole electric induction motor is shown in Figure 14 in which the connections produced as described above are identified. As shown in Figure 14, the wires 120 and 122 extend to a centrifugal switch 198 which is normally closed so that power is supplied to both of the windings 110 and 114 when the motor is started. After the motor attains its operating speed the centrifugal switch 198 opens and power is supplied only to the main winding 110.
