# Image scanning system.

## Abstract
An image scanning system includes a sub scanning drum adapted to be rotated both in the regular direction to feed a re cording sheet material in the sub scanning direction which is perpendicular to the rotational axis of the drum and in the re verse direction opposite to the sub scanning direction, and a scanning system for scanning a light beam across the re cording sheet material in the direction of the rotational axis of the drum. The system further includes a pair of nip rolls remov ably disposed on the drum, a stopper removably disposed downstream of the drum and the nip rolls, and a sheet dis charger. The recording sheet material is fed toward the stop per with the drum being stopped and the nip rolls being held away from the drum, and is supported thereon in the un inclined state. Then the nip rolls are pressed against the drum sandwiching the sheet material therebetween and at the same time the stopper is retracted away from the sheet material. The sub scanning drum is rotated in the regular direction or the re verse direction. if desired, to control the blank space formed between the first scanning line and the leading end of the et material before the drum is rotated for scanning. The et discharger is arranged not to act on the sheet material during the scanning.
