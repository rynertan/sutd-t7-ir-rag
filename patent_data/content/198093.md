## Description
The present invention relates to a memory device for use as an auxiliary memory device with a numerical control apparatus for controlling a machine tool or the like, and more particularly to a portable auxiliary memory device. Numerical control NC apparatus are used for controlling machine tools, industrial robots, and the like according to machining programs recorded on paper tapes and read one block by one block by the NC apparatus. As the machining process becomes more complex, the amount of information in the machining program is increased, and cannot sometimes be recorded on a paper tape of an ordinary length. Large capacity and relatively inexpensive magnetic recording disks or floppy disks, which are used in personal computers or the like, have recently found use as an auxiliary memory device for storing the entire machining program information for an NC apparatus. A drive device for floppy disks is connected to the NC apparatus and combined with a CRT display, a keyboard, or a paper tape reader for use as an auxiliary memory device for the NC apparatus. Recent floppy disk drive devices are incorporated in NC apparatus proper. Since the drive devices are not portable, but contained in the NC apparatus, they cannot be used as auxiliary memory devices for other NC apparatus. JP A 58175102 discloses a portable floppy disk auxiliary memory device, and JP U 5989405 discloses NC equipment having a pivotable door covering slots for receiving magnetic disks and having detecting means for detecting opening and closing of the door. The present invention has been made in an effort to solve the problem of the conventional auxiliary memory device. It is an object of the present invention to provide a portable floppy disk auxiliary memory device which has a floppy disk drive device that can be used as an auxiliary memory device for an NC apparatus and which can reliably prevent dust from entering the drive device. According to the present invention, there is provided a portable floppy disk auxiliary memory device comprising a body having an interior containing a floppy disk drive device, and having a door pivotally connected to the body and being movable between open and closed positions, characterised in that the portable floppy disk auxiliary memory device is connectable to an NC apparatus to supplement existing memory the body is formed of a plurality of walls including a front panel comprising a floppy disk insertion slot through which a floppy disk can be inserted into the drive device the door is pivotally connected to a front portion of the body to be movable between open and closed positions over the front panel comprising the floppy disk insertion slot a detecting means is disposed in the vicinity of the door for detecting opening and closing of the door a control unit is disposed in the body and is coupled to the floppy disk drive device and to the detecting means for enabling the floppy disk drive device to access a floppy disk therein only when the detecting means detects that the door is closed after the floppy disk has been inserted, and for issuing an alarm signal when the door is detected to have been opened during operation of the floppy disk drive device there being alarm means operable in response to said alarm signal to provide an alarm when the door is detected to have been opened during operation of the floppy disk drive device. The portable floppy disk auxiliary memory device of the invention is arranged as described above. Since the body in which the floppy disk drive device is contained is portable, it can be carried easily as desired, and connected to an NC apparatus proper in use. After use, the portable floppy disk auxiliary memory device can be carried and connected to another NC apparatus. Therefore, the portable floppy disk auxiliary memory device can efficiently be used in practice. Inasmuch as the door is attached to the front portion of the body and closes the insertion slot at all times except when a floppy disk is to be loaded or removed, dust is prevented from entering the portable floppy disk auxiliary memory device through the insertion slot while the floppy disk auxiliary memory device is being carried or used in a dusty place. As a result, the read write head is prevented from touching the magnetic recording surface of the floppy disk due to a dust deposit. Furthermore, when the door is opened while the floppy disk drive device is in operation, an alarm is issued by the alarm means to the operator, and thus the floppy disk is prevented from being read in error and recorded data is prevented from being subjected to an error.

The present invention will hereinafter be described in specific detail with reference to an embodiment shown in the drawings. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a portable floppy disk auxiliary memory device portable FD auxiliary memory device according to an embodiment of the present invention, Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the portable FD auxiliary memory device with its door open, and Fig. 3 is a block diagram of a control system for the portable FD auxiliary memory device. As shown, the portable FD auxiliary memory device has a body 1, and a handle 1c that is gripped when carrying the memory device is mounted on an upper portion thereof by a fixing means such as rivets or the like. A panel 1a is attached to the front face of the body 1 and has an insertion slot 1e defined centrally therein for inserting a floppy disk FD 8 therethrough. Within the body 1, there are housed a drive device FDD 7 for the FD 8 and a control unit 6. A door detecting button 1f is mounted on a lower portion of the panel 1a for detecting the opening and closing of a door 2. When the door 2 is closed, the door detecting button 1f is pushed in to operate an opening closing sensor positioned in the body 1 for applying a closed door signal to the control unit 6. A hook shaped engagement member 1g is attached to a lefthand side of the central portion of the panel 1a for engaging a locking member 2c on the door 2 when the door 2 is closed. In the rear portion of the body 1, there are provided a power supply not shown for operating the FDD 7 and signal cords not shown for connection to an NC apparatus described later . The door 2 is openably and closably mounted by hinges 1b on the front portion of the body 1 for protecting the panel 1a and preventing dust from entering through the FD insertion slot 1e. A handle 2a for opening and closing the door 2 is attached to a front face of the door 2. For opening the door 2, the handle 2a and a lever 2b disposed therein are gripped, whereupon the locking member inside the door 2 is unlocked from the engagement member 1g so that the door can be opened. The door 2 supports on its front face an access lamp 3 indicating that the FD 8 is being accessed, an alarm lamp 4 which flickers when the door 2 is opened while the FD 8 is being accessed, and an alarm buzzer 5 for generating an alarm when the door 2 is opened while the FD 8 is being accessed. These access lamp 3, alarm lamp 4, and alarm buzzer 5 are operated under commands from the control unit 6 disposed in the body 1. The portable FDD auxiliary memory device according to this embodiment is constructed as above. After the FD 8 has been located through the insertion slot 1e into the FDD 7, the door 7 is closed, and a closed door signal is issued from the opening closing sensor. Thereafter, an instruction to start to access the FD 8 is given manually or from an NC apparatus coupled to the portable FDD auxiliary memory device, whereupon the control unit 6 gives a command to start accessing the FD 8 to the FDD 7. In response to the access starting command, the FDD starts to access the FD 8 and supplies the control unit 6 with a signal indicating that the FD 8 is being accessed. With this signal, the control unit 6 energizes the access lamp 3 on the door 2 to give the operator an indication that the FD 8 is being accessed. When the door 2 is opened while the FDD 7 is accessing the FD 8, i.e., while the access lamp 3 is being energized, the door detecting button lf on the panel 1a detects that the door 2 is opened, enabling the opening closing sensor to apply a signal to the control unit 6. While the FD 8 is being accessed, therefore, the control unit 6 flickers the alarm lamp 4 on the door 2 and actuates the alarm buzzer 5 to give the operator a warning. When the door 2 is closed by the operator upon noticing the alarm lamp 4 or the alarm buzzer 5, the door detecting button 1f is pushed in by the door 2, and a closed door signal is applied from the opening closing sensor to the control unit 6. The control unit 6 now issues an OFF command to the alarm lamp 4 and the alarm buzzer 5. Fig. 4 is a flowchart of operation of the embodiment of the present invention. The flowchart will now be described. After the FD 8 has been inserted in the FDD 7, a step A ascertains whether the door 2 is closed or not. If the signal from the opening closing sensor 1f indicates that the door is closed, then the FD 8 can be accessed by the FDD 7. When the FDD 7 starts accessing the FD 8 under a command from the control unit 6, the access lamp is turned on to indicate that the FD 8 is being accessed. When the door 2 is opened while the FD 8 is being accessed, the answer to a decision step B is NO, and the alarm lamp 4 and the alarm buzzer 5 are turned on, giving the operator a warning. If the door is closed in the step B, then the alarm lamp 4 and the alarm buzzer 5 are turned off, and no warning is given. The FD 8 is continuously accessed, and the access lamp keeps energized until the accessing of the FD 8 is ended. After the accessing of the FD 8 is ended, the access lamp is turned off. Fig. 5 is a view showing the portable FDD auxiliary memory device as attached to an NC apparatus, and Fig. 6 shows such an arrangement in block form. Those parts in Figs. 5 and 6 which are identical to those shown in Figs. 1 through 3 are denoted by identical reference characters.

Designated at 10 is an arithmetic unit disposed in the portable FD auxiliary memory device of the present embodiment and comprising a microcomputer composed of a CPU central processing unit , a ROM read only memory , a RAM, an input output interface, and a bus interconnecting these components. The RAM serves to store the results of arithmetic operations effected by the CPU and data through the input output interface. The input output interface are connected to the FDD 7 and an input output interface of the NC apparatus 10 for a data exchange between them and the arithmetic unit 10. With the body 1 connected to the input output interface of the NC apparatus 20, data and a program can be written into the memory of the FD 8 inserted in the body 1 which serves as part of the memory of the NC apparatus 20, upon a command from the NC apparatus. A portable floppy disk auxiliary memory device of the invention can be carried and has a dust proof ability. Therefore, it can be used as an auxiliary memory device for a numerical control apparatus for machine tools or the like which are employed in dusty places.
