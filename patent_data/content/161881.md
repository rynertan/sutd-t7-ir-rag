## Description
This invention relates to a high molecular composite material containing as one component thereof a homopolymer or copolymer of an N substituted derivative of acrylamide or methacrylamide, for releasing a water soluble organic compound. High molecular composite materials of various types have hitherto been found and various applications for them have been proposed. As interactions upon which the formation of such composite materials rely, may for example be mentioned ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic bonds, charge transfer bonds, and hydrophobic bonds. The combination of compounds making up each high molecular composite material is determined by the type of such an interaction. Once one of the components making up such a high molecular composite material has been chosen, a limitation is imposed on the other component. It is this limitation to the combination of both components of each high molecular composite material and hence the limited possibility in variety of combinations of such components that no high molecular composite materials have found actual utility although a variety of high molecular composite materials has been proposed to date. For example, investigations have been made on the interactions between poly N vinylpyrrolidone , one of N substituted lactam derivatives having structures similar to N substituted amide derivatives of acrylamide or methacrylamide, and various materials. Due to insufficient interactions and the like, none of these investigations has yet turned to high molecular composite materials satisfactory enough to permit their practical applications. On the other hand, there has recently been reported an investigation on the interaction between an N isopropylacrylamide graft polymerized on cotton fabric and one of polyethyleneglycol mono p nonyl phenyl ether. Such an investigation does not suggest the formation of any of high molecular composite materials of this invention. US A 3,793,445 discloses a wettable polymer gel containing at least one binding protein physically and essentially permanently entrapped in the gel matrix. The gel is prepared by dissolving acrylamide monomer and N,N methylene bis acrylamide in a physiologic buffer solution containing a suitable dilution of an antibody protein. The gel is described as a reagent for use in competitive radioimmunoassay techniques for measuring antigens and haptenes. This patent neither contemplates nor discloses any technique for directly releasing a water soluble organic compound. An object of this invention is to provide a variety of high molecular composite materials each of which contains, as a component thereof, a homopolymer or copolymer of at least one N substituted derivative of acrylamide and methacrylamide hereinafter abbreviated as meth acrylamide . The invention is aimed at providing high molecular composite materials which permit easy control of their properties and which can be formed with ease into films and sheets, fibers and various moldings, inter alia. The present invention provides a high molecular composite material for releasing a water soluble organic compound comprising The invention also provides a method for releasing a water soluble organic compound which comprises the steps of Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained in detail in the following description. The base material of this invention permits the formation of composite materials with a very large number of low molecular or high molecular compounds because it contains a homopolymer or copolymer of at least one of N substituted meth acrylamides as one component thereof. It has the following advantageous effects. First of all, the formation of each composite material takes place between neutral molecules unlike ordinary ionic composite materials. Therefore, its bonds are not hard but soft. Secondly, intermolecular forces making up each high molecular composite material vary depending on the temperature. The properties of the composite material can hence be controlled by heating or cooling the composite material. Thirdly, the formation of a high molecular composite material of this invention into films and sheets, fibers, various moldings and so on may be facilitated because it can be dissolved in a solvent or can be melted. The high molecular composite material of this invention is formed between the above described homopolymer or copolymer and a low or high molecular compound, relying not on covalent bonds but on forces developed between their molecules. As a result, there are developed changes to the properties of its solution such as its viscosity, cloud point and the like, deposition of the composite material from a solution thereof, new properties imparted owing to the formation of the composite material, and so on. The homopolymer or copolymer contained in the high molecular composite material of this invention typically has the property that, when its aqueous solution is progressively heated, it is rendered hydrophobic to develop cloud. It should however be borne in mind that the homopolymer or copolymer is not necessarily limited to those having such properties as mentioned above. Any homopolymer or copolymer may be used so long as its hydrophilicity varies depending on the temperature. Such homopolymers and copolymers have amphiphilic properties, which means that they have such wide solubility that they are both hydrophilic and hydrophobic as demonstrated by their solubility in both organic solvents such as benzene and water. Examples of the above described homopolymer and copolymers, include homopolymers and copolymers of at least one of the following N alkyl or N alkylene substituted meth acrylamides In addition, one or more monomers selected from, for example, hydrophilic monomers, ionic monomers and hydrophobic monomers may additionally be copolymerized with one or more of the meth acrylamide monomers. As exemplary hydrophilic monomers, may be mentioned acrylamide, methacrylamide, N methylacrylamide, N methylmethacrylamide, diacetoneacrylamide, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, various methoxypolyethyleneglycol methacrylates, various methoxypolyethyleneglycol acrylates, N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone, N acryloyl alanine and N methacryloyl alanine. Further, vinyl acetate or glycidyl methacrylate, for example, may be introduced by copolymerization, followed by hydrolysis to impart hydrophilicity. Illustrative of ionic monomers are acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, vinylsulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, methallylsulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic acid, 2 acrylamido 2 phenylpropanesulfonic acid and 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propanesulfonic acid and their salts amines such as N,N dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, N,N diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, N,N dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, N,N dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide and N,N dimethylaminopropylacrylamide and their salts. Further, it is also possible to impart ionic properties by introducing various acrylates, methacrylates, acrylamides, methacrylamides or acrylonitriles by copolymerization and then hydrolyzing the thus introduced moieties. Hydrophobic monomers, may, for example, be N alkylacrylamide derivatives and N alkylmethacrylamide derivatives such as N n butylacrylamide, N n butylmethacrylamide, N tert butylacrylamide, N tert butylmethacrylamide, N n hexylacrylamide, N n hexylmethacrylamide, N n octylacrylamide, N n octylmethacrylamide, N tert octylacrylamide, N n dodecylacrylamide, N n dodecylmethacrylamide, N,N diglycidylacrylamide, and N,N diglycidylmethacrylamide N ω glycidoxyalkyl acrylamide derivatives and N ω glycidoxyalkyl methacrylamide derivatives such as N 4 glycidoxybutyl acrylamide, N 4 glycidoxybutyl methacrylamide, N 5 glycidoxypentyl acrylamide, and N 6 glycidoxyhexyl acrylamide acrylate derivatives and methacrylate derivatives such as ethyl acrylate, methylmethacrylate, butyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate acrylonitrile methacrylonitrile vinyl acetate vinyl chloride olefins such as ethylene, propylene and butene styrene α methylstyrene butadiene and isoprene. The acceptable proportion of such a hydrophilic, ionic or hydrophobic monomer to the acrylamide or methacrylamide derivatives may vary depending on the chosen acrylamide or methacrylamide derivative and the above mentioned monomer. Although not sweepingly applicable to every combination, the hydrophilic, ionic and hydrophobic monomers may generally be used in amounts of 60 wt. or less, 30 wt. or less and 60 wt. or less, respectively. Specific polymerization methods which may be used for production of the polymers used by this invention as described above may be, by way of example For polymerization in the method 2 , it is possible to use a variety of solvents because the N substituted meth acrylamides have very good miscibility with such solvents. More specifically, exemplary solvents are alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and 1,4 dioxane, ketones such as acetone, amides such as N,N dimethylformamide and N,N dimethylacetamide, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform and methylene dichloride, dimethyl sulfoxide, N methylpyrrolidone, chain glycols such as diglyme and tetraglyme, and basic solvents such as pyridine, inter alia. In the above polymerization methods, the polymerization may be initiated only by heating the polymerization systems. However, use of a polymerization initiator can generally bring about better results. Any polymerization initiators may be used as long as they can initiate radical polymerization. For example, inorganic peroxides, organic peroxides, combinations of such peroxides and reducing agents, and azo compounds may be mentioned. More specifically, such polymerization initiators may include ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, tert butyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, cumenehydroxy peroxide, tert butyl peroxy 2 ethyl hexanoate, and butyl perbenzoate. As reducing agents which may be used in combination with such polymerization initiators, may be mentioned sulfites, hydrogensulfites, salts of lower valence metals such as iron, copper and cobalt, organic amines such as aniline and reducing sugars such as aldose and ketose. Usable azo compounds may include azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2 azobis 2 amidinopropane hydrochloride, 2,2 azobis 2,4 dimethylvaleronitrile and 4,4 azobis 4 cyanovaleic acid. Two or more of the above described polymerization initiators may be used in combination. In this case, the amount of the polymerization initiator to be added may be within commonly employed ranges, for example, within the range of 0.01 5 wt. , or preferably 0.05 2 wt. , both based on the weight of the monomer. Among the thus obtained polymers, the block like polymer or the polymer obtained after evaporation of the solvent may be crushed into a powdery form or may be melted and then formed into a flake , fiber or film like form. The granular polymer may be provided as a granular form without any further processing. The latex like polymer may be employed to impregnate and coat a fibrous or porous material such as fabric or paper, or may be formed into films. The particular form of the polymer or copolymer may suitably be selected depending on how it is used. When used, for example, in a suspended or dispersed state in a liquid as in a fluidized bed, it may often be used in the form of powder or beads. A powdery product may be obtained by various methods as described above, for example, by conducting gel polymerization in an aqueous solution and then drying and grinding the resultant resin. A granular product may generally be produced with ease by the suspension polymerization method. Since the N alkyl or N alkylene substituted meth acrylamide derivative has generally high solubility in water, suspension polymerization may be practiced as the reversed phase suspension technique in which a monomer or its aqueous solution is dispersed in an oil, as the salted out suspension polymerization technique in which an electrolyte is dissolved in a large amount in an aqueous solution to reduce the solubility of a monomer, or as the precipitation and suspension polymerization technique in which polymerization is carried out at the elevated temperature of the cloud point of the intended polymer or higher so as to cause the polymer to precipitate. In addition, it is also possible to integrate the polymer with porous beads such as silica, alumina or zeolite, for example, by impregnating the porous beads with a solution of the polymer or effecting graft polymerization on such porous beads. It is also possible to incorporate a third component miscible with the monomer or monomers but immiscible with the resulting polymer when it is polymerized by one of the above mentioned polymerization techniques. Incorporation of such a third component permits production of a porous resin. The above described homopolymer or copolymer of at least one of the N substitued meth acrylamides or a copolymer between at least one of the meth acrylamides and one or more other copolymerizable monomers, which homopolymer or copolymer pertains to this invention, is water insolubilized prior to its application. For insolubilizing, the following methods may be employed The above insolubilizing methods will next be described more specifically. In the first method, it is possible to use as exemplary crosslinkable monomers N,N methylenebisacrylamide, N,N diallylacrylamide, triacrylic formal, N,N diacryloylimide, N,N dimethacryloylimide, ethyleneglycol diacrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, various polyethyleneglycol diacrylates, various polyethyleneglycol dimethacrylates, propyleneglycol dimethacrylate, propyleneglycol diacrylate, various polypropyleneglycol diacrylates, various polypropyleneglycol dimethacrylates, 1,3 butyleneglycol diacrylate, 1,3 butyleneglycol dimethacrylate, 1,4 butyleneglycol dimethacrylate, glycerol dimethacrylate, neopentylglycol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylolethane trimethacrylate, trimethylolethane triacrylate, tetramethylolmethane tetramethacrylate, tetramethylolmethane tetraacrylate, divinylbenzene and diallyl phthalate. The proportion of each of these crosslinkable monomers to the above described N substituted meth acrylamide may depend on the desired crosslinking degree. Although not applicable sweepingly to every situation, the crosslinkable monomers may each be used in an amount of 0.01 10 wt. based on the total monomer. N Alkoxymethyl meth acrylamide derivatives useful in the practice of the second method may include N hydroxymethyl meth acrylamides. For example, N methylol meth acrylamides, N methoxymethyl meth acrylamides, N ethoxymethyl meth acrylamides, N n butoxymethyl meth acrylamides and N tert butoxymethyl meth acrylamides may be used. The proportion of each of such N alkoxymethyl meth acrylamide derivatives to the above described N substituted meth acrylamides may vary depending on the combination of the N substituted acrylamides and the N alkoxymethyl meth acrylamide derivatives. Although not applicable sweepingly to every combination, the N alkoxymethyl meth acrylamide derivatives may each be used generally in an amount of 0.01 30 wt. . In the third method, the proportion of the hydrophobic monomer to the N substituted meth acrylamide having amphililic property may vary depending on the combination of the N substituted meth acrylamide and the hydrophobic monomer. Although not conclusively limitable, the proportion of the hydrophobic monomer may generally be 1 wt. or more, or preferably 3 wt. or more. In this case, the copolymerization may be effected by the random copolymerization method, block copolymerization method or graft copolymerization method. In the fourth method, the polymerization is carried out by the bulk polymerization method. This may be practiced by polymerizing the monomer as is without diluting it with any solvent to obtain a polymer block or by suspending the monomer in a solvent and then effecting the polymerization of the monomer in the form of droplets so as to obtain a granular polymer. In the fifth method, the polymer is subjected to a heat treatment. The heating conditions may vary depending on the polymer and do not remain constant. A polymer obtained by, for example, bulk polymerization, suspension polymerization or solution polymerization is treated generally at 60 250 C, or preferably at 80 200 C. In this case, when the polymer is obtained by the solution polymerization method, its heat treatment may be carried out concurrently with its drying or with the evaporation of the solvent. Turning to the sixth method in which the polymer is integrated with, for example, a fibrous material, the above described N substituted meth acrylamide may be impregnation or graft polymerized to a water insoluble fibrous material such as natural or synthetic fibers such as cellulose fibers, nylon fibers, polyester fibers or acrylic fibers or non woven fabric made of polypropylene or an ethylene propylene copolymer, or to a water insoluble porous material such as silica, alumina or zeolite. Alternatively, the fibrous or porous material may be impregnated with the polymer. In the seventh method, the polyfunctional compound such as epichlorohydrin is reacted with the polymer so that the polymer is crosslinked and insolubilized. In this method, it is necessary to introduce hydroxyl, amino or carboxy groups in advance in the polymer. Amino or carboxy groups can be introduced readily by copolymerization. In the case of hydroxyl groups, they may be introduced by copolymerization of hydroxyethyl methacrylate, isopropenyl phenol by first introducing, for example, vinyl acetate or glycidyl methacylate by the copolymerization method and then saponifying it with a basic material to form hydroxyl groups. Thereafter, the above prepared polymer and a polyfunctional compound such as epichlorohydrin are reacted to each other so as to crosslink and insolubilize the polymer. When the polymer is insolubilized in an aqueous solution as is, it is converted into an agar like state. By simply crushing the thus obtained polymer, it can be used as is. When it is solubilized by dispersing the aqueous solution in an oil, granular gels are obtained. According to the eighth method, a polymer complex is formed by copolymerizing the polymer with the above described monomer containing an active hydrogen or combining the polymer with a copolymer of such a monomer. In this case, it is also possible to form polymer complex by regeneration of the active hydrogen atoms of the copolymer which are substituted with ammonium ions or the like by the addition of an acid. The above described eight methods may be used singly or in combination. More effective results are, in general, obtained when two or more of these methods are used in combination. As the other component which makes up the high molecular composite material of this invention, a very wide variety of compounds may be mentioned. Among such compounds, preferred ones may be classified into two groups, namely, 1 compounds containing active hydrogen and 2 compounds containing hydrophobic groups.

Perfumes contain aromatic rings or long chain alkyl groups as their skeletal structures, to each of which are substituted one or more groups such as acyl, alkoxy, formyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyacyl, amino, hydroxyl, lactam, hydroxyalkyl, hydroxyalkenyl, formylalkyl, formylalkenyl, carboxyalkyl, carboxyalkenyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkenyl and alkoxycarbonyl groups. In order to form a high molecular composite material which containing a homopolymer or copolymer of at least one of the above described N substituted meth acrylamide derivatives, either one of the following two methods may be followed. In one of the methods, the homopolymer or copolymer is reacted with the other component in a state either dissolved or dispersed in a solvent such as water so as to form the high molecular composite material in a liquid phase. According to the other method, the homopolymer or copolymer and the other component are mixed in a solid state or in a melted state so as to form the high molecular composite material. When the high molecular composite material is formed in a liquid phase, a variety of solvents may be employed. As exemplary solvents, may be mentioned water, alcohols, cyclic ethers, ketones, amides, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, dimethylsulfoxide, N methylpyrrolidone, chain glycols, and basic solvents as described above. The selection of a particular solvent is effected in accordance with the types of compounds, which make up each high molecular composite material, and the intended utility of the high molecular composite material. The specific method for forming the high molecular composite material in a liquid phase is extremely simple. It is only necessary to either dissolve or suspend the homopolymer or copolymer of at least one of the N substituted meth acrylamide derivatives in a solvent and then to add the other component to the resultant solution or suspension either as is or in the form of a solution. Here, the proportions of both components may vary depending on the intended properties of a composite material to be formed and cannot be defined sweepingly. However, the molar ratio of hydroxyl, carboxyl or sulfonic groups to amido groups may range from 0.0001 to 10,0000 or preferably from 0.001 to 1,000. On the other hand, the concentration of the homopolymer or copolymer may take any value so long as its solution can be mixed with a solution of the other component, and may generally range from 0.1 to 50 wt. . As an alternative method, certain properties of each composite material may be changed by controlling the pH to replace active hydrogen atoms of its substituent groups such as hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, or sulfonic groups with ammonium ions or metal ions such as alkali metal ions so that the ratio of such hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, or sulfonic groups to its amido groups is changed. In this case, the force maintaining the integrity of the composite material is generally reduced by such ionization. As a further alternative method, the high molecular composite material may also be formed by mixing the other component as an ionized raw material with the homopolymer or copolymer and then adding a third component capable of forming active hydrogen atoms again, such as a strong acid component, or heating the salt of a weak base to form active hydrogen atoms again, thereby forming hydroxyl, carboxyl or sulfonic groups again. Whichever method is followed, the temperature may be within the range of 10 150 C or preferably 0 100 C. The thus formed high molecular composite material may take various forms depending on the combination of its components and the solvent employed for its formation. When intermolecular forces of the high molecular composite material are weak, the composite material is dissolved as a solution. In this case, the physical properties of the solution, such as viscosity, change from the original solution. Where one of the components is such a compound as forming a high molecular composite material and making itself hydrophobic like phenol, the viscosity of the solution is lowered, as a result of the formation of the high molecular composite material, compared with a solution obtained without such a compound. In the case of a compound substituted by one or more substituent groups which have been dissociated into ions like sodium benzenesulfonate, the viscosity of the resulting solution is higher compared with that of a solution obtained with a compound not substituted by such substituent groups. On the other hand, some of the homopolymers and copolymers of the N substituted meth acrylamide derivatives, which homopolymers and copolymers are essential components of high molecular composite materials of this invention, have such properties as thermosensitive polymers, namely, such properties that they develop cloud when heated as aqueous solutions the temperature at which cloud is developed will hereinafter be called cloud point . When such homopolymers or copolymers are used, their cloud points will obviously change as a result of formation of composite materials. In other words, the cloud point drops when the viscosity of its corresponding solution is lowered, while the cloud point rises when the viscosity is increased conversely. When intermolecular forces of a high molecular composite material are relatively strong, the high molecular composite material may form an emulsion or may be caused to deposit in its solution upon its formation. Where the formation of the high molecular composite material takes place with a low molecular compound, the resulting high molecular composite material is in many instances dissolved in the solution. However, the high molecular composite material is in many instances caused to deposit in the solution when its formation takes place with a high molecular compound. The above mentioned phenomena may vary depending on the types of compounds and solvent to be selected. Furthermore, the thus formed high molecular composite material has such a property that the intermolecular forces may be controlled by changing its temperature. It is generally possible to increase the intermolecular forces by heating the composite material. The above described high molecular composite materials can be provided in various forms, depending on their intended utility. They may be used as they are when they are provided in state dissolved in solutions or they may be dissolved in solvents and then used as solutions when they have deposited, so that such solutions are spun into fibers, cast into films, applied to impregnate fibrous, granular or hollow materials, followed by the evaporation of the solvents to form their composite materials, or by driving off the solvents from the solutions, formed into powders which may then be melted and formed into flakes or blocks. They may also be insolubilized by treating them with light such as ultraviolet, heat or radiation or with high molecular compounds capable of forming composite materials with the homopolymers or copolymers of the N substituted meth acrylamide derivatives, in the course of the above described production processes thereof. As a specific method for forming a high molecular composite material by mixing its components in a solid state or molten state owing to an application of heat thereto, the high molecular composite material may be formed by impregnating the homopolymer or copolymer of at least one of the N substituted meth acrylamide derivative, which homopolymer or copolymer has been produced in a solid state by the above described method, with the other component either as is or in the form of a solution, followed optionally by removal of the solvent. This method has such a feature that the high molecular composite material can be formed while maintaining the shape of the above used homopolymer or copolymer of the N substituted meth acrylamide derivative. As a specific method for forming a high molecular composite material by heating its components and mixing them in a melted state, the high molecular composite material may be provided by charging both components in a mixer, kneading them thoroughly and then heating and melting them, and then molding the resultant melt into desired shapes. Specifically, the high molecular composite materials of this invention may be formed or molded into fibers by melt spinning, films by calendering, hollow articles by blow molding, and various moldings by injection or extrusion molding. The forming or molding temperature varies considerably depending on the type of each polymer to be used, and may range from 50 300 C in view of its glass transition temperature. The high molecular composite materials of this invention are formed from the homopolymers or copolymers of the N substituted meth acrylamide derivatives and a wide variety of compounds which range from low molecular compounds to high molecular compounds, and are provided in various shapes depending on their intended end use. Their specific utility differs naturally depending whether they are high molecular composite materials formed with low molecular compounds or high molecular composite materials formed with high molecular compounds. In the case of composite materials formed with low molecular compounds, making use of such low molecular compounds, the resulting composite materials have such utility as agents for holding and releasing the low molecular compounds, agents for separating such substances from solutions, thermo sensitive surfactants obtained through the formation of composite materials with ionic substances or surface activating agents. More specifically, it is possible to provide composite materials having sustained release functions under certain specific conditions set with respect to their corresponding temperatures, and solvents, new separation systems in each of which a composite material is formed in a solution to separate its solute and the thus formed composite material is then decomposed for its recycle by making suitable selection as to the solvent and the like, and thermo sensitive surfactants having highly temperature dependent surface activating capacity by controlling the formation of composite materials with ionic materials or surface activating agents depending on their corresponding temperatures. On the other hand, turning to the homopolymers or copolymers of the N substituted meth acrylamides, certain physical properties of solutions of the homopolymers or copolymers such as cloud points, viscosity and the like may be controlled by forming composite materials with low molecular compounds. When used as functional materials such as adhesives, and paints, various properties such as waterproofness may be improved by forming the homopolymers or copolymers into composite materials together with low molecular compounds. When composite materials were formed with high molecular compounds in solutions, it is possible to control the flow charateristics and viscosity characteristics of the resultant solutions as well as the polarity of their homopolymers or copolymers. Specifically, the composite materials have utility as modifiers for water soluble polymers such as polymeric floculants, oil recovering polymers and paper converting or conditioning agents. When the homopolymers or copolymers form composite materials with natural polymers such as proteins or enzymes, the homopolymers or copolymers can hold such natural polymers. Further, low or high molecular compounds containing hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, or sulfonic groups substituted thereto may also be allowed to co exist in order to insolubilize such composite materials. When the homopolymers or copolymers are formed into composite materials with synthetic polymers, high molecular composite materials having new properties unforeseeable from the starting homopolymers or copolymers may be expected. These composite materials may be dissolved generally by making suitable selection as to their solvents. They may also be melted. Accordingly, they may be formed or molded into films, fibers, various moldings. As specific utility, may be mentioned functional materials for separation such as separation membranes, injection molded articles such as car parts and electronic and electrical parts, coating lamination films, film sheets, coating or covering materials for pipes, electrical wires and cables, sundry goods such as toys, dolls, games, and stationary goods, various adhesives such as hot melt adhesives and pressure sensitive adhesives, heat sealing agents, paint resins, polymeric plasticizers, optical materials, transparent materials, base materials having sustained release functions for sustained release drugs, and medical materials. As one example of such utility of the high molecular composite materials of this invention, sustained release agents for valuable substances will hereinafter be described in detail. With a view toward reducing side effects of pharmaceutics, agricultural chemicals and the like as well as allowing their effects to last over prolonged periods of time, a variety of sustained release methods has been studied on the basis of the concept of releasing valuable substances little by little. One approach is to make the molecular weights of such valuable substances higher. In a specific method, such substances are introduced e.g. in side chains of the polymers and are then released little by little by hydrolysis or the like. Another approach is to coat such valuable substances with a high molecular compound which is e.g. degradable in the organisms, for example, by polylactic acid and then to release the valuable substances upon degradation of the thus coated high molecular compound. Both approaches are however accompanied by problems. For example, the former approach involves problems with respect to the manner for increasing the molecular weights while the latter approach has problems on the coating method. Paying attention to the fact that the use of such valuable substances takes place in the presence of water, the present inventors made an investigation on the holding and release of such valuable substances by aqueous gels. As a result, those obtained by water insolubilizing the homopolymers or copolymers of the meth acrylamide derivatives, which homopolymers or copolymers pertain to the present invention, have been found to be extremely convenient. These sustained release materials for valuable substances have two convenient properties. One of the properties is that as already mentioned above, the homopolymers or copolymers of this invention can develop intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds, or hydrophilic bonds with compounds substituted by groups containing active hydrogen atoms, such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, sulfonic, phosphoric and or mercapto groups, or compounds containing hydrophobic residual groups substituted thereto, whereby to form composite materials. Furthermore, these intermolecular forces can be enhanced when heated. The other property can be brought about by water insolubilizing the homopolymers or copolymers. Namely, it is the property that the water insolubilized homopolymers or copolymers absorb and hold water upon contact with aqueous solutions but when heated, shrink and release water even in the presence of a large excess of water. The homopolymers or copolymers are caused to either shrink or swell depending whether their temperatures are high or low. The holding and release of substances can thus be controlled by changing the temperature while making use of these two properties. The holding and release of valuable substances are effected by using the homopolymers or copolymers of this invention, which have the above described properties. They are however practiced in different ways depending on the type of each valuable substance. In the case of compounds substituted by groups containing active hydrogen atoms, such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, sulfonic, phosphoric and or mercapto groups or compounds containing hydrophobic residual groups substituted thereto, which compounds can develop intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds, or hydrophobic bonds with the homopolymers or copolymers, their holding and release can be effected with ease by controlling the temperatures of the homopolymers or copolymers. As specific examples of the above described compounds, may be mentioned proteins, enzymes, amino acids, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, foods, antibiotics, a variety of physiologically active substances, phenols, alcohols, aliphatic carboxylic acids, aromatic carboxylic acids, heterocyclic carboxylic acids, aliphatic sulfonic acids, aromatic sulfonic acids, mono and di esters of phosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid esters such as ADP and ATP, surfactants, aromatic compounds, coloring matter, perfumes. These compounds may be held at high temperatures and released at low temperatures. Where valuable substances are water soluble low molecular compounds exemplified by fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, urea and ammonium phosphates, the swelling and shrinking properties of the homopolymers or copolymers are used. As a simple holding method, it is only required to bring their aqueous solutions into contact with the homopolymers or copolymers so that the valuable substances are taken as their solutions into the homopolymers or copolymers. The concentrations of the solutions may be at any levels so long as they are below the concentrations of their respective saturated solutions. Where there are chances for the resultant composite materials to be brought into water such as rainwater, the low molecular compounds taken in the homopolymers or copolymers are, as a releasing method, dissolved out as water diffuses into the homopolymers or copolymers. Where there are no chances for the resultant composite material to be brought into water, it is necessary only to heat the homopolymers or copolymers so that they are shrunk to release the low molecular compounds. Where there are chances for the homopolymers or copolymers to be brought into contact with water, it is required, as a simpler releasing method, only to mix powders of the low molecular compounds with their corresponding homopolymers or copolymers in advance. When water is caused to gather around the resultant mixtures after a rainfall, the powders are dissolved in the water while the homopolymers or copolymers are swollen by the water. As a result, such compounds are held in their corresponding homopolymers or copolymers. As another method, low molecular compounds may be held in the homopolymers or copolymers by effecting the polymerization of the homopolymers or copolymers in solvents free of the low molecular compounds, which are to be held, by solution polymerization which is one of the above described preparation methods, adding the low molecular compounds either before or after the polymerization, driving off the solvents from the solutions and then heat treating the resultant mixtures to hold the low molecular compounds in the homopolymers or copolymers. Their release takes place little by little whenever the composite materials are brought into contact with water. In the above case, the influence of temperature to the holding and release varies depending how the holding and release takes place. When the release of the low molecular compounds takes place, for example, as a result of diffusion of the low molecular compounds through their associated homopolymers or copolymers, the diffusion velocities are lowered at high temperatures because the homopolymers or copolymers are shrunk at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the homopolymers or copolymers are caused to swell and the diffusion velocities are hence increased. As a result, the low molecular compounds are held at high temperatures and released at low temperatures. Where materials, which are to be released, are held in gel like polymers, they are held at low temperatures as the gel like polymers are swollen at the low temperatures and are released at high temperatures as the gel like polymers are shrunk at the high temperatures. The above described valuable substances are generally held at high temperatures and released at low temperatures. The holding temperature is lower than the thermal modification temperature of each substance and gives the maximum holding volume for the particular substance. It changes depending on the type of each homopolymer or copolymer and the type of each compound to be held, but is generally within the range of 10 100 C. On the other hand, the releasing temperature is determined by the releasing velocity. The releasing velocity increases as the temperature decreases. It is generally within the range of 10 80 C. When the homopolymer or copolymer of this invention is caused to hold a valuable substance at a high temperature in an aqueous solution of the valuable substance, the resultant composite material may be used as is in the aqueous solution. Alternatively, the composite material may be separated by filtration and stored either as is or in a dry state. The holding volumes of these compounds may vary depending on the compositions of the homopolymers or copolymers and the compounds to be held. They may usually be within the range of 1 1,000 mg g homopolymer or copolymer. By lowering the temperatures of the composite materials, the substances can be released completely. It is also possible to carry out the holding and release by controlling the pH of an aqueous solution. Namely, in the case of an ampholytic electrolyte such as amino acid or protein, its holding can be effected preferentially at pHs below the isoelectric point of the ampholytic electrolyte on the acidic side. On the alkaline side, its release can be effected preferentially at pHs above the isoelectric point of the ampholytic electrolyte. In other words, the holding and release can be controlled by temperature and pH. After releasing the held substance in the above manner, the homopolymer or copolymer may be used again as is. Alternatively, after the release, it may further be brought into contact with chilled water or an alkaline solution and washed thoroughly therewith so that it is regenerated. In the manner described above, the above described substance may also be integrated with the homopolymer or copolymer of this invention, for example, by coating the former on the latter and then released at a desired temperature or pH. Turning next to the selection as to the composition of the homopolymer or copolymer, the optimum composition changes depending on each substance to be held. It is therefore preferred to conduct a test in advance whenever the homopolymer or copolymer is employed to hold a substance. As one measure for the selection, it is generally preferred to use a copolymer having relatively low hydrophobicity when holding a substance having relatively high hydrophobicity, and vice versa. In the above case, more selective holding and release become feasible by the use of a copolymer with an ionic monomer as the copolymer, because the use of such an ionic monomer permits introduction of either one of the ionic properties, namely, either cationic property or anionic property into the resultant copolymer and the ionic interaction can also be used upon holding various substances. When a copolymer with an N ω glycidoxyalkyl acrylamide such as N,N diglycidylacrylamide or N 4 glycidoxybutyl acrylamide is used, highly reactive epoxy groups can be introduced in the resultant copolymer. By reacting an amino acid, a protein such as an antigen, antibody or enzyme or a coloring matter with the epoxy groups, both affinity and interaction can be used in combination for holding various substances, thereby permitting more selective holding and release. The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples. Added to and dissolved in 50 ml of N,N dimethylformamide were 12.5 g of N acryloylpyrrolidine hereinafter abbreviated as N APy and 0.164 g of azobisisobutyronitrile. After sweeping the contents with nitrogen gas in a reactor, they were polymerized at 50 C for 3 hours. After completion of the polymerization, the polymerization mixture was poured into ethyl ether to deposit the resultant N APy polymer. It was collected by filtration and then dried, thereby obtaining the N APy polymer. Its yield was 92 . The above prepared N APy polymer was added to an aqueous phenol solution having a concentration of 0.19 in such an amount that its concentration reached 0.5 . The viscosity of the resultant solution was measured by an Ubbelohde s viscometer at 25 C and 35 C. In the same manner, the viscosity of an aqueous solution of the N APy which solution was free of phenol was also measured. The ratio in reduced viscosity of the aqueous phenol containing solution to the aqueous phenol free solution hereinafter abbreviated as viscosity ratio . viscosity ratio reduced viscosity in the presence of phenol reduced viscosity in the absence of phenol was 0.90 at 25 C and 0.81 at 35 C. From these results, it was indicated that the N APy polymer formed a composite material in the phenol containing aqueous solution and as a result, the viscosity of the aqueous solution was lowered and at the same time, the intermolecular forces of the composite material became stronger as the temperature increased. In the same manner as in Example 1 except that the solutes given in Table 1 were used respectively at the concentrations shown in Table 1, the viscosities of aqueous solutions of the N APy polymer were measured and viscosity ratios were then calculated. Results are shown in Table 1. In Examples 3 and 5 of Table 1, composite materials were caused to deposit from their corresponding aqueous solutions and the aqueous solutions were thus clouded. Benzoic acid was added to a 0.5 aqueous solution of the N APy polymer to a concentration of 0.098 . After converting the mixture into a homogeneous aqueous solution, the aqueous solution was placed in the cell of a spectrophotometer, and the temperature of the cell was raised by circulating water and its transmittance was measured at 420 nm. The middle temperature between the maximum transmittance and the minimum transmittance was determined as a cloud point from the measurement data. It was 46 C. The clouded solution became colorless and clear upon its cooling. The cloud points of a 0.5 aqueous solution of the N APy polymer were measured at the benzoic acid concentrations given in Table 2 in exactly the same manner as in Example 15. At each of the concentrations, the clouded solution became colorless and clear upon its cooling. When an aqueous solution containing 0.095 g of phenol dissolved in 2 ml of water was added to 5 ml of a 5 aqueous solution of the N APy polymer prepared by aqueous solution polymerization and the resultant mixture was stirred, the solution was emulsified. The average size of droplets in the emulsion was measured by the simple turbidity method. It was found to be 0.49 µm. When the emulsion was progressively diluted with water, it turned to a colorless and clear aqueous solution. When 40 ml of a 2.5 solution of p isopropenylphenol hereinafter abbreviated as PIPE acrylonitrile hereinafter abbreviated as AN copolymer trade mark Milex SP 2,000 product of Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Incorporated 70 PIPE 30 AN in methyl ethyl ketone was added to 26 ml of a 2.5 solution of the N APy polymer in acetone, a yellow precipitate was formed. The yield of the precipitate was 1.59 g. When 40 ml of a 2.5 solution of a PIPE AN styrene hereinafter abbreviated as St copolymer trade mark Milex SP 6,000 product of Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Incorporated 30 PIPE 37 AN 33 St in methyl ethyl ketone was added to 11 ml of a 2.5 solution of the N APy polymer in acetone, a yellow precipitate was formed. The yield of the precipitate was 1.19 g. To a homogeneous aqueous solution obtained by adding 7 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of ammonium polyacrylate to 10 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of the N APy polymer, was added 2 ml of a 1N aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. The formation of a composite material was observed at the interface between both aqueous solutions simultaneously with the addition of the aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. The composite material was separated in the form of a white film. The yield of the composite material was 0.15 g. This composite material was not dissolved in water but was dissolved in N,N dimethylformamide. A composite material was formed and obtained in the form of a white film in exactly the same manner as in Example 26 except that 10 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of N n propylacrylamide hereinafter abbreviated as N PA polymer and 8 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of ammonium polyacrylate were used. The yield of the composite material was 0.16 g. A composite material was formed in exactly the same manner as in Example 26 except that 10 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of N,N dimethylacrylamide polymer and 8 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of ammonium polyacrylate were used. The composite material was obtained as an aqueous, white and clear gel having expandable and shrinkable elasticity. A clouded aqueous solution was obtained by forming a composite material in exactly the same manner as in Example 26 except that 10 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of an acrylamide polymer and 8 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of ammonium polyacrylate were used. The transmittance of the aqueous solution was measured at 420 nm. It was 4.3 . A clouded aqueous solution was obtained by forming a composite material in exactly the same manner as in Example 26 except that 10 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of a methacrylamide polymer and 8 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of ammonium polyacrylate were used. The transmittance of the aqueous solution was measured at 420 nm. It was 3.3 . Five milliliters of a 7 aqueous solution of an N n propylacrylamide polymer and 3 ml of a 4 aqueous solution of ammonium polyacrylate were mixed and placed in a syringe. The above mixed aqueous solution was then extruded from the needle of the syringe into a 0.1 N aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid of 50 C, thereby obtaining thread like white material. It was then washed with water and immersed in distilled water. It was caused to swell with water into an elastic string like gel. Dissolved in 1,170 g of distilled water were 124.95 g of N acryloylpyrrolidine, 374.85 g of N acryloylpiperidine and 10.0 g of N,N methylenebisacrylamide to obtain an aqueous solution of the mixture of N acryloylpyrrolidine, N acryloylpiperidine and N,N methylenebisacrylamide. After cooling the aqueous solution to 10 C, it was transferred to a 2 liter, Dewar flask made of stainless steel. It was bubbled with nitrogen gas for 1 hour by feeding the nitrogen gas at a flow velocity of 1 liter min. through a ball filter. Thereafter, a solution containing 2.55 g of ammonium persulfate dissolved in 10 g of distilled water and another solution containing 1.16 g of sodium hydrogen sulfite dissolved in 10 g of distilled water were simultaneously added to the above aqueous solution and the resultant aqueous solution was adiabatically polymerized. The resultant gel was chopped into small pieces and then dried. It was thereafter crushed and a 20 100 mesh fraction was collected as a sample. Two grams of the sample powder were added to 100 ml of an aqueous solution which contained 310 ppm of phenol. After stirring the resultant mixture at 40 C for 15 minutes, it was filtered through a glass filter to obtain 3.8 g of a swollen gel. By measuring the phenol concentration of the filtrate, it was found that the swollen gel held 16.0 mg of the phenol. Thereafter, 0.475 g of the swollen gel the amount of held phenol 2.0 mg was packed in a glass column having an inner diameter of 1.0 cm and a length of 10 cm. Distilled water was caused to pass at 0.5 C and a flow velocity of 3.5 ml min. through the column. After fourty five minutes, the phenol concentration of the thus passed solution reached below its detectable lower limit. The phenol concentration of the above obtained solution was measured. It indicated that 99 of the phenol, which had been held in the swollen gel, had been released. Incidentally, the phenol concentrations were each determined by measuring the absorbance of its corresponding solution at 254 nm. By using 0.475 g of the swollen gel which had been obtained in Example 32 and contained 2.0 mg of phenol, the releasing time and released amount were measured at 40 C in the same manner as in Example 32. After 4 hours, the phenol concentration of the thus passed solution reached below the detectable lower limit. However, the amount of the released phenol was 78 of its initially held amount. With the copolymer compositions given in Table 3, sample powders were obtained by effecting their polymerization and grinding in the same manner as in Example 32.

Results are shown in Table 4. After adding 2 g of the sample powder obtained in Example 36 to 100 ml of a 0.2 aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate and stirring the resultant mixture at room temperature for 15 minutes, the resulting liquid mixture was filtered by using a glass filter to obtain 16.4 g of a swollen gel the amount of held ammonium sulfate 28.8 mg . By using 2.0 g of the swollen gel the amount of held ammonium sulfate 3.5 mg , the releasing time and released percentage of ammonium sulfate were measured at various temperatures in the same manner as in Example 32, resulting in 83 at 0.5 C in 4 hours and 97 at 80 C in 1.5 hours.
