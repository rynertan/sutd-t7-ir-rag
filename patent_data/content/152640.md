# MEMBRANE SPACER ELEMENT AND RECIPROCATING DIALYZER

## Abstract
A reciprocating dialyzer is described for use as an artificial kidney or other extracorporeal mass transfer de vice. A dialyzer unit includes a membrane package having an aligned pair of thin semi permeable membranes forming a chamber between the interior faces to receive fluid such as blood to be treated, and spacing elements in dialysate chambers at the exterior faces of the membranes which contact the membranes and limit their expansion, while allowing chemical transfer to the dialysate slurry. A plurality of such treatment units received between spaced plates comprises a dialyzer. Blood flow into and out of the mem brane packages is through a central conduit, with free slurry being introduced and withdrawn from the dialysate chamber at the periphery of each unit. The spacing elements are flexible and of plastic with mesh material modified to provide central and rim seals as well as membrane engag ing faces designed to limit membrane displacement and cause formation of a thin blood column while not unduly masking the membrane surfaces and allowing slurry flow at all times including when the blood chamber is filled with blood. Certain spacing elements also allow emptying of blood from the dialyzer without need for positive pressure on the fluid outside the dialyzer.
