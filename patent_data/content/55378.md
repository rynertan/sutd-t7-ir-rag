# A method of brazing adjoining surfaces of elements.

## Abstract
Brazing of metallic elements to an electronic circuit board carrying a plurality of chips requires brazing materials which remain strong at high temperatures used to remove and replace the chips attached by solder balls to the board. According to the present invention flanges and pins 19 are brazed to the board 10 with a gold tin brazing solder 15 which is modified during brazing by addition of a Group IB metal 13 to promote formation of the higher melting point Î² phase of the solder and a Group VIII metal 14 to draw tin out of the melt by gettering. The melting temperature of the brazing solder is raised substantially during brazing to a value above the melting temperature of the solder balls attached to the chips.
