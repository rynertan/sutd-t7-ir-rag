# ASBESTOS DISPOSAL

The containment area comprises a modified cargo con tainer housing a baling machine, and optionally paint spray ap paratus or shrink wrapping equipment, and is fitted with means for introducing asbestos thereto including means for forming a fine spray curtain of water through which the asbes tos must pass in order to reduce hazards of air borne asbes tos particles.
