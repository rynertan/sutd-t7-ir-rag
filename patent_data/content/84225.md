# Flow sensor with extended low flow range.

## Abstract
In a flow sensing device in which flow is measured by the linear displacement of a moveable bobbin 4 within a throat 7 , the bobbin 4 contains a cylinder 12 and piston 13 arrangement, with the piston 13 linked to the same linear displacement sensing device 16 as the bobbin 4 . Fluid pressures upstream and downstream of a calibrated orifice 18 parallel to the throat 7 , is applied to opposite ends of the piston 13 . Low flow rates are measured by the displacement of the piston 13 , with movement of the bobbin 4 together with the piston 13 taking over the flow sensing function at higher flow rates.
