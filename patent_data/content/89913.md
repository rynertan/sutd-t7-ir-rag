## Description
UNSATURATED POLYESTER AND PROCESS FOR MAKING AN UNSATURATED POLYESTERBackground of the Invention In the UV curing of film, the exposed air coating interface is more inhibited and results in an under cured or wet surface depending on the speed of cure, photo initiator, monomers and light intensity . For this reason a nitrogen blanket is usually placed over the photo reactive surface before and during the W treatment. Thus, there exists a great demand for aUV curable coating having a dry tack free surface at room temperature in an air atmosphere. One known ultraviolet curable composition comprises a solution of a from 5 to about 50 percent by weight of a polyester of terephthalic acid esters and a glycol of from about 60 mole percent to 100 mole percent of 1,2 propylene glycol and from 0 to 40 mole percent ethylene glycol said polyester having an intrinsic viscosity of from about .05 to about .6 b from 95 to 50 percent by weight of ethylenically unsaturated photopolymerizable monomer and c an effective amount of photo initiator in amounts of from .5 to 25 percent by weight of the total photocurable composition. The disadvantage of this composition is that the photopolymerizable monomers are cured whereas the polyester serves only as a binder due to the absence of a double bond existing between two carbon atoms in the polyester itself. The present invention provides a composition and process for making said composition that is devoid of the disadvantage listed above.Summary of the Invention Disclosed is a process for the production of an unsaturated polyester comprising reacting from 95 to 80 parts by weight of a carboxyl terminated copolyester with 5 to 20 parts by weight of an epoxy acrylate compound at a.temperature no greater than 1700C wherein said copolyester has an acid number of from about 20 to about 85 and said epoxy acrylate compound having the general structural formula EMI2.1 where R3 is selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen radical or an alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Also disclosed is an unsaturated polyester comprising A from 95 to 80 parts by weight of a carboxyl terminated copolyester having an acid number from about 20 to about 85 B from 4 to 15 parts by weight of an epoxy acrylate compound of the formulaEMI2.2 where R3 is selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen radical or an alkyl radical having 1 to 4 carbon atoms C from .25 to 2 parts by weight of a stabilizer.Detailed Description of the Invention The production of a copolyester resin conventionally employs two stages an esterification stage and a condensation stage. The preparation of the polyester prepolymer occurs in the esterification stage by the reaction of a diol and a dicarboxylic compound. Optionally, the introduction of a chain branching agent in the esterification stage such as that disclosed in U.S.application Serial No. 129,817 presently pending, may produce a polyester prepolymer having internal chain branching which has been found to lower the melt viscosity of the polyester at a given molecular weight to improve the leveling properties of the final powder coating.Leveling properties are defined to be that property yielding a smooth and substantially untextured finish over a smooth surface substrate, such as polished metal. Further, introduction of a multi functional alcohol chain branching agent into the esterification stage creates a polymer having an increased hydroxyl number which, upon carboxyl end group capping, increases the required amount of the carboxyl capping agent. That agent, remaining reactive in excessive concentrations, may be toxicologically undesirable. The polyester prepolymer, whether subjected to internal chain branching or not, is polycondensed in the condensation stage to produce a copolyester resin having an intrinsic viscosity from about..l0 to about .26 dl g and preferably from .13 to .15 dl g. Intrinsic viscosity is determined by a method utilizing a by weight mixture of phenol tetrachloroethane as a solvent and a reading of intrinsic viscosity at 300C. The dicarboxylic compound of the present invention may be either a dicarboxylic acid or dicarboxylic ester.The dicarboxylic acids may be an alkyl dicarboxylic acid having a total of from 2 to 16 carbon atoms, or an aryl dicarboxylic acid having a total of from 8 to 16 carbon atoms. Specific examples of alkyl dicarboxylic acids suitable for the present invention are oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, and the like. Various examples of an aryl acid include the various isomers of phthalic acid, such a paraphthalic terephthalic acid and naphthalic acid.Specific examples of alkyl substituted aryl acids include the various isomers of dimethylphthalic acid, such as dimethylisophthalic acid, dimethylorthophthalic acid, and dimethylterephthalic acid the various acids of diethylphthalic acid, and diethylterephthalic acid the various isomers of dimethylterephthalic acid, such as 2,6 dimethylnaphthalic acid and 2,5 dimethylnaphthalic and the various isomers of diethylnaphthalic acid.Generally, dimethylterephthalic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid are preferred dicarboxylic acids. In lieu of the various dicarboxylic acids, the various diesters thereof may be utilized. Thus, the dicarboxylic compound may be an alkyl diester containing a total of from about 2 to 20 carbon atoms, as well as the alkyl substituted aryl diesters containing about from 10 to about 20 carbon atoms. Examples of specific alkyl diesters include dimethyl adipate, diethyl adipate, and the like. Specific examples of the various alkyl substituted aryl diesters include the various isomers of dimethyl phthalate, the various isomers of diethyl phthalate, the various isomers of dimethyl naphthalate and the various isomers of diethyl naphthalate. Of the dicarboxylic diesters, preferably the various isomers of dimethyl phthalate dimethyl terephthalate are used. Of the dicarboxylic compounds, the various isomers of dimethyl terephthalate are most preferred. These carboxylic acids, or the diester thereof, react in the esterification stage with a diol containing from about 2 to 10 carbon atoms. The glycol may be straight chained or branched. Specific examples include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, 1,2 butane diol, 1,3 butane diol, 1,4 butane diol, 2,3butane diol, neopentyl glycol, hexamethylene glycol, cyclohexane dimethynol, in the ester diol product of neopentyl glycol and hydropavalic acid propanoic acid, 3 hydroxy 2, 2 dimethyl 3 hydroxy 2, 2 dimethylpropyl ester . Of the various diols, neopentyl glycol is most preferred. The diol is added to the esterification stage in the reactive charging step in a concentration in comparison to the dicarboxylic compound in a mole ratio from about 2.20 to about 1.15 1. Preferably the molar ratio is from about 1.7 to about 1.3 1. In those circumstances where an internal chain branching agent is desirable, the chain branching agent of the present invention is a compound having at least a functionality of 3 to incorporate within the chain of the polyester prepolymer and retain a branch reactive cite. Chain branching agents having at least a trifunctionality include trimellitic anhydride, pentaerythritol, glycerol, trimethylol propane, triethylol propane, and other multi functional alcohols. The chain branching agent is reacted in the esterification stage in a concentration in comparison with the concentration of the dicarboxylic compound in a mole ratio less than about .10 1. Desirably, the chain branching agent has a concentration from about .5 to 10 mole percent, comparative to the concentration of the dicarboxylic compound, and preferably in a concentration of from 3 to 5 mole percent. The esterification stage comprises a reaction charging step and a chain branching agent addition step. The chain branching agent addition step occurs simultaneously with the reactant charging step when the alcohol chain branching agent is a multi functional alcohol such as trimethylol propane, triethylol propane, pentaerythritol, and glycerol. The reactant charging step preceeds the chain branching agent addition step when trimellitic anhydride is the chain branching agent. In such latter case, the chain branching addition step proceeds after at least 90 percent of the dicarboxylic compound and diol have completed methanolysis. Whereas, the esterification stage proceeds uninterrupted or undelayed when the chain branching agent is one of the multi functional alcohols.An additional 20 minutes is required in the esterification stage before the condensation stage when the trimellitic anhydride is the chain branching agent. Known catalysts can be used to prepare the carboxyl terminated polyester. Examples of catalysts are dibutyl tin oxide, manganese acetate, zinc acetate titanium butyl titanate and antimony trioxide. Copolyester resins having carboxyl terminated end groups are prepared to be reacted with the epoxyacrylate for use in this invention. These copolyester resins preferably have internal chain branching to provide a low melt viscosity of the polyester at a given molecular weight to improve the leveling properties of the copolyester powder coating. In those circumstances where the copolyester resin produced as described herein above, does not contain carboxyl terminated end groups, the termini of the copolyester polymer chain must be terminated with carboxyl groups for reaction with the epoxy acrylate compound to make a UV curable copolyester resin as per the invention.The hydroxyl capping agents may be any anhydride of a carboxylic acid having at least two acid groups which upon reaction with the terminus of the polyester chain, retains a free carboxyl acid group as a reactive site for the epoxy acrylate compound. Specific examples of these anhydrides include anhydrides of the formula EMI6.1 wherein R is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl radical having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, a halosubstituted alkyl radical having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, a hydroxy substituted akyl radical having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, an aryl radical having from 6 to 24 carbon atoms and wherein R1 is an organic radical volatile at temperatures of the carboxyl capping reaction anhydrides of the formula EMI6.2 wherein R2 is an organic radical having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms. Desirably, anhydrides of acids having at least two carboxylic acid end groups may be used as the hydroxyl capping agent. Specific examples of these anhydrides are phthalic anhydride, succinic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, and the like.Of these anhydrides, trimellitic anhydride is preferred. Tie hydroxyl capping agent may be added subsequent to the condensation of excess glycols but prior to the addition of the epoxy acrylate. The hydroxyl capping agent may be added in a concentration of from about 1 mole percent to about 25 mole percent of carboxylate units contained in the final polymer. Desirably, the concentration is from about 10 mole percent to 14 mole percent of carboxylate units contained in the final polymer. Preferably, the concentration of the hydroxyl capping agents is about 12.5 mole percent per mole of carboxylate units. When introducing the hydroxyl capping agent, temperatures within the reactor should range from about 1500 to about 2750C. Desirably, the temperatures should range between 2000 and 2500C and preferably the range of temperature is from ab.out 2100 to about 2350C. The pressure in the reactor is one atmosphere or ambiant pressures. The atmosphere for the reactor is in an inert atmosphere, preferably N2. The reaction of the polyester and the hydroxyl capping agent should continue until such time that the acid number of the copolyester should be from about 20 to about 85. After the copolyester resin has significant carboxylic acid end groups, the temperature of the reactor is lowered to about 1200C to about 1890C, and preferably from about 1500C to about 1700 C. The pressure is about 1 atmosphere or ambiant pressures.When a nitrogen atmosphere is present during the hydroxyl capping stage, the nitrogen atmosphere is subsequently purged and replaced by air. At this stage, a stabilizer may be added. Although the copolyesters of this invention possess good resistance toward heat aging and photodegration, it is advisable to stabilize these compositions by incorporating stabilizers in the copolyester compositions.Examples of such known compounds are 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4, 6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxy benzyl benzene, tetrak methylene 3,5 di tert butyl LI hydroxy hydrocin namate methane, N,N hexamethylene bis 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyhydrocinnamamide , N,N trimethylene bis 3,5 ditert butyl 4 hydroxyhydrocin namamide , hydroquinone, pbenzoquinone, p methoxyphenol, napthoquinone, anthroquinone, mono tert butyl hydroquinone, 2 5 diphenyl pbenzoquinone, pyridine, phenothiazene, p diaminobenzene, beta naphthol, naphthylamine, pyrogallol, cupious chloride and nitrobenzene. The amount of stabilizer required will vary upon the particular use of the UV resin however, the amount should be such that the carbon to carbon double bond of the epoxy acryiate is stabilized during the addition of the epoxy acrylate compound to avoid the formation of freeradicals by the double bonds. After the addition of the stabilizer, the temperature should be no greater than about 1700C. At this temperature, the epoxy acrylate is added in a ratio of from at least 1 0.5 of the carboxyl group of the resin to the epoxy groups, preferably 1 1. At temperatures above 1700C, the epoxy acrylate has a greater tendency to volatilize causing further problems in the incorporation of the epoxy acrylate compound. Epoxy acrylates useful in the present invention have the general structural formula EMI8.1 where R3 is selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen radical or an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Specific examples of these epoxyacrylates are glycidyl methacrylate and glycidyl acrylate. Of these epoxy acrylates glycidyl methacrylate is preferred. The photosensitizers useful in the practice of this invention are known. Preferably a phosphine compound is used in the present invention. The following are representative phosphines useful in this invention triphenylphosphine tri p toluyl phosphine diphenylmethyl phosphine diphenyl ethyl phosphine diphenylpropyl phosphine dimethyl phenyl phosphine diethylphenyl phosphine dipropyl phenyl phosphine divinylphenyl phosphine divinyl p methoxyphenyl phosphine divinyl p bromophenyl phosphine divinyl p toluyl phosphine diallyl phenyl phosphine diallyl p methoxyphenyl phosphine diallyl p bromophenyl phosphine diallyl p toluyl phosphineThe photosensitizer is preferably added after the polyester resin has been reacted with the epoxy acrylate compound in amounts conventionally used for photosensitizers. Preferably, photoinitiators are used in the present invention. When photoinitiators are used, they are present in amounts of from .5 to 25 percent by weight and preferably 1 to 15 percent of the total photocurable composition. Typical examples of photoinitiators which are applicable in the present invention are 2,2, dimethoxy 2 phenylacetophenone benzil isopropyl benzoin ether isobutyl benzoin ether diethoxy acetophenone 4 ,4 bi chloromethyl benxophenone chloroacetophenone 4 tert butyl,4 trichloroacetophenone benzophenone methyl diethanol amine , di sec butoxyacetophenone p methoxybenzophenone acetophenone propiophenone xanthrone benzoin benzaldehyde napthoquinone anthroquinone benzophenone In the application of the novel resins, as disclosed in the present invention, one would employ diluents as a means of controlling viscosity of said resin. Such diluents are preferably ethenically unsaturated photopolymerizable compounds. The ethylenically unsaturated compounds useful in the present invention are lower alkyl and substituted alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid. Also useful are allyl acrylates and methacrylates. Examples of such compounds include methyl methacrylate ethylmethacrylate 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate isobutyl methacrylate glycidyl methacrylate glycidyl acrylate butyl acrylate 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate 2 methoxyethyl acrylate 2 phenoxyethyl acrylate 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate benzyl acrylate tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate 2 ethylhexyl acrylate trimethylolpropane acrylate 1,6 hexanediol diacrylate 1,6 hexanediol dimethylacrylate ethoxy ethoxy ethyl acrylate pentaerythritol triacrylate Also useful is N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone The amount of diluent used in conjunction with the resin of the present invention will vary according to the desired application and the preferred viscosity of the diluted resin composition. Preferably the diluent is in the range of 95 to 40 percent by weight of the overall composition. In the application of the novel resins of the present invention one may employ levelers to aid in the uniform dispersion of the resin. Known levelers can be used in the present invention, such as silicone polycarbinols, silicone surfactants, cellulose acetate butyrate resins and trisnonyl phenyl phosphate, preferably silicone polycorbinols. The amount of leveler used in conjunction with the resin of the present invention will vary according to the desired application. Preferably the leveler is present in the range of .3 to 3 percent by weight of the overall composition. The source of radiation for carrying out the method of the present invention can be any suitable source, such as actinic radiation produced from a mercury, xenon or carbon arc, a beam from a laser source, for example, a He Cd laser, or the electron beam produced in or from a cathode ray gun. The only limitation placed on the radiation source used is that it must have an energy level at the irradiated composition sufficient to impart to the polymerizable system energy at an intensity high enough to reach the decomposition level of the photosensitive compound.

The carboxyl terminated material was cooled to 1750 C. The nitrogen purge was extinguished and an air purge was initiated. .4 parts of p methoxy phenol was added. After 30 minutes with continuous stirring, the temperature was lowered to 1700C, and 3.6 parts of glycidyl methacrylate were added. The materials were allowed to react for 10 minutes. The product was then removed from the reactor. The final acid number was determined to be 4.1. Example IX 1589 parts of a carboxyl terminated resin Neopentyl glycol trimetholpropane terephthalate trimellic anhydride in a weight ratio of 100 3 85 12 was charged in a reactor. The resin had an acid number of 55. A nitrogen purge was initiated and the reactor was heated, with stirring, to 1850C. After the resin was melted, the reactor temperature was lowered to 1700C. The nitrogen purge was extinguished and an air purge was initiated.16 parts of p methoxy phenol were added with continuous stirring. Ten minutes later the reactor temperature was lowered to 1500C and 211 parts of glycidyl methacrylate were added. The materials were allowed to react for 10 minutes, after which the product was removed and cooled.The final acid number was determined to be 2. Example X 54 parts of the resin produced in Example VII, 23 parts of N vinyl pyrrolidone, 23 parts of ethoxy ethoxy ethyl acrylate, 2 parts of 2,2 dimethoxy 2 phenylacetophenone, 1 part triphenylphosphine .5 parts ofSD 5097 leveler silicone polycarbinol and 2 parts benzophenone were slowly added to a reactor with constant stirring. The reactor temperature was raised to 1200F and the reactants were allowed to mix for 2 hours. The UV curable resin was allowed to cool to room temperature. A small amount of the resin was poured into a sheet of Mylar polyester film . Another layer of the same film was placed above the UV curable resin.A rolling pin was used to press out the mixture into a thin film. The entire laminate was placed under low intensity ultra violet lights 2400 microwatts cm2 for a period of 15 minutes. The cured polyester film was peeled from the two sheets of Mylar. The ultra violet cured film had a gauge of .011 inches and a tensile strength of 3420 pounds per square inch. The elongation was 125 and at 100 modulus the resin had a value of 2720 pounds per square inch. The tensile strength, elongation and 100 modulus was evaluated on an Instron Tester Mddel TMF 86. Example XI 2 parts of the resin produced in Example IX was placed in a 20 milliliter beaker followed by 2 parts of vinyl pyrrolidone. This mixture was stirred and was heated to 800C. After 2 minutes, .04 parts of 2,2 dimethoxy 2 phenylacetophenone was added to the mixture followed by the addition of .02 parts of triphenylphosphine. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature. The mixture was a pourable light yellowish fluid.The mixture was poured onto a Melinex film substrate and placed under a set of low intensity 2400 microwatts cam ultraviolet lights. After 15 minutes of irradiation in an air atmosphere, the coated Melinex was removed from the light source. The resins surface exposed to air was tack free. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention.
