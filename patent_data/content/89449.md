The cylindrical tube 6 is hooked on the end of a gasket body 8 allowing to seal on the shaft 1 , on the pump 9 and on a counterface body 10 pressed on a ring 11 by a pushing spring 12 on a crown relief 16 of the shaft 1 . On the other end of the cylindrical tube 6 , a sealing element is fitted in an inner annular groove 19 , consisting of a plate 20 covered with vulcanized rubber 21 . In the gasket body 8 , a duct 17 is foreseen for draining the liquid infiltrations.

## Claims

The said coaxial is booked in an integrally operating way on the end of a gasket body for sealing on the shaft, on the pump and on a counterface body pressed, by means of a ring, by a thrusting spring on a crown shaped relief of the shaft. 2 Bearing with integrated sealing device for motor water pumps, according to the previous claim, characterized by The fact that on the other coaxial end, a preclusion sieve is foreseen positioned in an inner annular groove and consisting of a thin plate covered with volcanized rubber. 3 Bearing with integrated sealing device for motor water pumps, according TO The previous claims, crracterized by the fact That in The gasket body, a drai ning duct is foreseen for eliminating the liquid infiltrations. 4 Bearing with integrated sealing device for motor water pumps, according to The previous claims, characterized by the fact that eR2loys two sets of balls 2 and 3 on shaft 1 properly fitted at the same distance by means of a pair of cages 4 and 5 in plastic material . The above shaft is turning by means of the said cinematisms in the cylindrical coaxial 6 engaging the two ball sets 2 and 3 in grooves foreseen for this purpose. Cylindrical coaxial 6 foresees a hoo king profile 7 on one end binding by groove a seal body 8, the task of which is to ensure sealing on shaft 1, on the pump body 9 as well as on counterface bo dy 10. In particular, the counterface body 10 is kept pressed by ring 11 as a consequence of the Thrust made by helical spring 12, the position of which is fixed in advance by ring 13 its position is depending on groove 14 on shaft 1. Annular gasket 11 has an additional seal on shaft 1 by means of annular piece 15 trith crown shaped relief 16. On body 8, a duct 17 is foreseen permitting the drain of liquid infiltrations, if any, through bore 18 in correspondence of body 9. On The other end of ring 6, a sealing element is foreseen engaged in 19 and consisting of plate 20 ,covered with volcanized rubber 21 acting as s seal 0 shaft 1.

## Description
Bearing with integrated sealing device for motor water DUTDS. The invention refers to a bearing with integrated sealing device, to be emplo ed . the water pumps for motors. Such pumps are in general to be used with motors cooled by liquid circulation, and particularly with Those for motor cars, trucks, lorries, excavators and tractors. For the movement of the turning pie cr determinating the liquid circulation, these pum2s employ a bearing with two ball crowns or with one ball crown and one roller crown and one sealing device. This co r ar t is at present mounted by fitting a gasket on the shaft positioned on the relevant counterface. The turning piece is fitted, which contemporarily acts as a lock and a seal, by means of a contact surface properly ground. The invention permits to avoid The above mounting sequences by adopting an operative assembly including both the ball bearing and the gasket and in this way is to be directly mounted in the pump body. Therefore, the proceeding enables to reduce the mounting times, a better compacting of the pump components and a more efficient seal. The operative assembly foresees a cylindriccal coaxial body which can be fitted integral on the pump, for mounting the supporting shaft of the turning piece which rotates on two ball sets kept by two cages at equal distance. The said coaxial is hooked in an integrally operating way on the end of a gasket body for sealing on the shaft, on the pump and 6n a counterface body pressed, by means of a ring, by a thrusting spring on a crown shaped relief of the sfa On the other coaxial end, a preclusion sieve is foreseen positioned in an in ner t ar groove and consisting of a thin plate covered with bar. 7n the gasket body, a draining duct is foreseen for eliminating the liquid in filtrations. A not limiting execution form. is illustrated by the drawings of Table 1, of which fig. 1 is the longitudinal section of the operating assembly fitted on the pump. Fig. 2 is the magnified longitudinal section of one half of the assembly illustrated in the preceding figure. The version employs two sets of balls 2 and 3 on shaft 1 properly fitted at the same distance by means of a pair of cages 4 and 5 in plastic material.The above shaft is turning by means sf the said cinematisms in the cylindrical coaxial 6 engaging the two ball sets 2 and 3 in grooves foreseen for this purpose. Cylindrical coaxial 6 foresees a hooking profile 7 on one end binding by groove a seal body 8, the task fo which is to ensure sealing on shaft 1, on The pump body 9 as well as on counterface body 10. In particular, the counterface body 10 is kept pres sed by ring 11 as a consequence of the thrust made by helical spring 12, The position of which is fixed in advance by ring 13 its position is depending on groove 14 on shaft 1. Annular gasket 11 has an additional seal on shaft 1 by means of annular piece 15 with crown shaped relief 16. On body 8, a duct 17 is foreseen permitting the drain of liquid infil orations, if any,Through bore 18 in correspondence on body 19. On the other end of ring 6, a sealing element is foreseen engaged in 19 and consisting of plate 20 covexed with volcanized rubber 21 acting as a seal on shaft 1.The operative assembly can be fitted differently carried out bu changing the form of The components and the relevant materials that are amployd.
