## Description
The present invention relates to a high speed current limiting circuit breaker for limiting and breaking a short circuit current at a high speed, according to the pre characterizing part of Claim 1. Such a circuit breaker is known from EP A 0 074 186. Another conventional current limiting circuit breaker is shown in FIG. 5 and comprises a self recovery type current limiting element 2 hereinafter simply referred to as current limiting element connected in series with a circuit breaker 1 and in parallel with a resistance 3. A first current transformer 4 for detecting an over current is provided between the current limiting element 2 and the circuit breaker 1. A first relay 5, for determining operation time and current of the circuit breaker 1 is controlled by an output of the current transformer 4. The circuit breaker 1 is tripped by a first trip coil 6 in response to a signal from the relay 5. Further provided to the resistance 3 is a second current transformer 7 for detecting operation of the current limiting element 2. A second relay 8 is responsive to an output of the second current transformer 7 , and a second trip coil 9 for tripping the circuit breaker 1 is responsive to the output of the second relay 8 . Operation of the conventional current limiting circuit breaker in FIG. 5 is explained as follows with reference to the current versus time characteristic graph of FIG. 6 and the current limiting breaking waveforms of FIG. 7. In FIG. 6, curve A represents operation time in accordance with the output of the first current transformer 4 as a function of current through the circuit breaker 1, and curve B represents evaporation time as a function of current through current limiting element 2. The curves A and B intersect each other at a point C. Another curve D represents operation time in accordance with the output of the second current transformer 7 as a function of current of the circuit breaker 1. When the current flowing through the second transformer 7 is I As shown in FIG. 6, in a current region which is smaller than a minimum set current value I Current limiting and breaking in the current region between the current I Thus, while the current limiting element 2 is evaporated, a current as shown by curve i The operation shown in FIG. 7 shows that the overcurrent i As apparent from the above mentioned description, the time period t It is confirmed that the shorter the time from a fault occurence to the breaking of the overcurrent is, the longer the number of times of repeated use of the current limiting element 2 is. Then, inventors improved such conventional known high speed current limiting circuit breaker, and thereby have obtained an improved high speed current limiting circuit having high speed breaking operation. This improved high speed current limiting circuit is disclosed in EP A 0 147 509. This document falls under Art. 54 3 EPC. The above mentioned improved high speed current limiting circuit breaker is described with reference to FIG. 8. The parts 1 to 6 correspond to the parts 1 to 6 in FIG. 5. A current transformer 16 for detecting an operation of the current limiting element 2 is connected to a current detection pulse generator 17. The current detection pulse generator 17 is connected to a gate of a thyristor 7. The thyristor 7, a capacitor 8 functioning as a power source and an electro magnetic repulsion coil 14 are connected in series, as shown in FIG. 8. A movable rod 10 is inserted in the electro magnetic repulsion coil 14 which is disposed facing the circuit breaker 1. A circuit 15 including a diode 16 and an A.C. power source 20 for energizing the capacitor 8 is connected across the capacitor 8. The diode 16 is for charging the capacitor 8. When the overcurrent occurres and a current flows through the parallel resistance 3, the current transformer 16 detects the current and the current detection pulse generator 17 comprising an operational amplifier produces a trigger pulse. The trigger pulse turns on the thyristor 7. As a result of the turning on of the thyristor 7, the charged energy in the capacitor 8 is discharged through the electro magnetic repulsion coil 14 . Accordingly, the movable rod 10 is transferred very quickly to the circuit breaker 1 by an electro magnetic repulsion force produced between the movable rod 10 and the electro magnetic repulsion coil 14 . Then the movable rod 10 knocks a latch not shown in FIG. 8 of the circuit breaker 1, and thereby breaks the circuit breaker 1. In FIG. 9, waveforms a , b and c correspond to those of FIG. 7 a , b and c . A waveform d of FIG. 9 shows a current i However, such high speed current limiting circuit breaker of FIG. 8 has the following problems. That is, the operation of the current limiting element 2 , caused by the fault current and so on, is detected by detecting the current flowing through the parallel resistance 3 by utilizing the current transformer 16. Therefore, the high speed current limiting circuit breaker has a large bulk on account of the existence of the current transformer 16. Further, in actual high speed current limiting circuit breakers applied to a high voltage circuit, usually two current limiting elements 2a, 2b are connected in series as shown in FIG. 10, and two parallel resistances 3a, 3b are connected to the current limiting elements 2a, 2b, respectively, as shown in FIG. 10, wherein a current transformer 16b is connected in series to the parallel resistance 3b. Under such case, when a trouble, for example, a getting out of order occurs on the current limiting element 2a, so that a current becomes not to flow through the current limiting element 2a, the current i The present invention intends to offer an improved high speed current limiting circuit breaker which is small in bulk and cost by avoiding redundant use of the current transformer 7 or 16. A high speed current limiting circuit, breaker of the present invention comprises a self recovery type current limiting element for limiting a fault current a parallel resistance connected in parallel with said self recovery type current limiting element a circuit breaker connected in series with said self recovery type current limiting element a fault current detector for detecting condition of a fault current flowing through said circuit breaker a breaker tripping means for tripping said circuit breaker in response to an output of said fault current detector a fault voltage detector for detecting a fault voltage generated on said parallel resistance a switching element connected with and actuated by said fault voltage detector and an electro magnetic coil which is connected in series with said switching element and a power source in a manner to be excited when said switching element is actuated. According to the present invention, the high speed current limiting circuit breaker is furthermore characterized in that said fault voltage detector is connected in parallel with said parallel resistance and that said electro magnetic coil is an electro magnetic repulsion coil and a movable rod is provided for breaking said circuit breaker by tripping a latch in said circuit breaker by electro magnetic repulsion when said electro magnetic repulsion coil is excited by said power source when said switching element is actuated by said voltage detector. The subclaims contain advantageous modifications of the present invention. The following is a detailed description of preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which In FIG. 1, a current limiting element 2 is connected in series with a circuit breaker 1 and a parallel resistance 3 is connected in parallel with the current limiting element 2. A transformer 4 for detecting an overcurrent is provided between the current limiting element 2 and the circuit breaker 1. A relay 5 for determining operation time and operation current of the circuit breaker 1 is connected so as to be actuated by the current transformer 4. A trip coil 6 for tripping the circuit breaker 1 is connected with the relay 5. A voltage divider 12 is connected in parallel with the parallel resistance 3. The voltage divider 12 comprises, for example, two capacitors connected in series with each other as shown in FIG. 1. A voltage detection pulse generator 13 is connected with the voltage divider 12 for detecting a voltage produced by dividing the voltage generated on the parallel resistance 3. The voltage detection pulse generator 13 generates a pulse signal when the voltage detection pulse generator 13 detects a predetermined voltage from the voltage divider 12. A fault voltage detector 14 comprises the voltage divider 12 and the voltage detection pulse generator 13. The voltage detection pulse generator 13 is connected with a gate of a thyristor 7. The thyristor 7, a capacitor 8 functioning as a power source and an electro magnetic repulsion coil 9 are connected in series, as shown in FIG. 1. A movable rod 10 is inserted in the electro magnetic repulsion coil 9 which is disposed facing the circuit breaker 1. A circuit 15 including a diode 11 and an A.C. power source 20 for energizing the capacitor 8 is connected across the capacitor 8. The diode 11 is for charging the capacitor 8. Operation of the high speed current limiting circuit breaker in FIG. 1 is described as follows. When a fault current, for example, an over current, flows through the current limiting element 2, the current limiting element 2 is evaporated, and as a result a current flows through the parallel resistance 3. Therefore, a voltage is produced between both terminals of the parallel resistance 3. The voltage dividers 12 divides the produced voltage. The voltage detection pulse generator 13 detects a predetermined voltage or higher one generated on the parallel resistance 3 and generates a trigger pulse. The trigger pulse is supplied to the thyristor 7. The trigger pulse turns on the thyristor 7. As a result of the turning on of the thyristor 7, the energy charged in the capacitor 8 is discharged through the electro magnetic repulsion coil 9. Accordingly, the movable rod 10 is transferred very quickly to the circuit breaker 1 by an electro magnetic repulsion force produced between the movable rod 10 and the electro magnetic repulsion coil 9. Then the movable rod 10 knocks a known latch not shown of the circuit breaker 1, thereby to break the circuit breaker 1. As apparent from the above mentioned description, the high speed current limiting circuit breaker of the present invention reacts with the operation of the current limiting element 2 by detecting the voltage, and therefore a conventional current transformer 7 which is, for example, a window type current transformer, is not utilized in the present invention. Accordingly, the distance between the current limiting element 2 and the parallel resistance 3 can be made as short as possible and therefore the bulk of the high speed current limiting circuit breaker of the present invention can be made very small. In FIG. 4, another embodiment of the present invention applied to a high voltage circuit is disclosed. Two current limiting elements 2a and 2b are connected in series as a current limiting element. To each current limiting element 2a, 2b, parallel resistances 3a, 3b are connected in parallel as shown in FIG. 4. The voltage divider 12 is connected to the parallel resistances 3a, 3b as shown in FIG. 4. When a trouble occurs on the current limiting element 2a itself and a current becomes not to flow through the current limiting element 2a, a current flows through the parallel resistance 3a and therefore a voltage between both terminals of the parallel resistance 3a is produced. Thus the voltage detector 13 detects the trouble of the current limiting element 2a through the voltage divider 12, and breaks the breaker 1. When a trouble occurs on the current limiting element 2b itself, the voltage detection pulse generator 13 can detect the trouble of the current limiting element 2b likewise. Further, when the current limiting element 2a or the current limiting element 2b evaporates on account of the fault current, the voltage detector 13 can detect the fault current likewise and can break the breaker 1. Thus, the application of the high speed current limiting circuit breaker of the present invention to the high voltage circuit can be realized by utilizing only a single voltage divider 12. Therefore, the bulk of the high speed current limiting circuit breaker can be made small. FIG. 2 is a graph of characteristic curves of the operation time versus current of the embodiment of the present invention. The operation of the high speed current limiting circuit breaker of the present invention is almost similar to that of the conventional one in FIG. 6. However, the operation characteristic of the circuit breaker 1 in accordance with the output of the voltage detection pulse generator 13, is determined in accordance with the current i Further, current limiting and breaking in the current region between the current I Thus, while the current limiting element 2 is evaporated, a current as shown by curve i Besides the above mentioned embodiments, wherein a capacitor voltage divider is used as the voltage divider 12, a resistance voltage divider or a resistance and capacitor voltage divider can be used also as the voltage divider 12.
