# Method of manufacturing a luminescent screen.

## Abstract
A conversion screen such as is used for X ray image intensifer screens, X ray image intensifer tubes, cathode ray tubes, image pick up tubes, X ray electro graphy, fluorescent lamps and the like is formed by the deposition of a layer of conversion material on a car rier 19 via a melting space 7 which is preferably heated by means of a plasma arc. This method of depo sition offers very robust screens with a high density and also allows the filling of recesses in a carrier with conversion material, so that structured conversion screens can be formed.
