# A multiple electron beam cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
A multiple electron beam cathode ray tube has an array of cathodes 30A, 30B, 30C formed on one side of an electrically insulating substrate 26 . Grids 32A, 32B, 32C are positioned in spaced relation about the cathodes on said one side of the substrate 26 . Electrical means 22, 24 are connected to said cathodes 30A, 30B, 30C and grids 32A, 32B, 32C to apply appropriate potentials thereto for forming a plurality of indi vidually controlled electron beams.
