# Radiation detector having a unitary free floating electrode assembly.

## Abstract
A multicell x ray radiation detector includes a chamber for confining a gas that produces electron ion pairs incidental to absorbing radiation. The chamber 12 is formed by a channel having a bottom 20 and sidewalls 22 , one of the side walls having a window 28 for admitting radiation to the chamber. A multicell unitary electrode assembly 34 is mounted within the chamber. An upper compressed elastic member 70 is interposed between the electrode assembly and the chamber and, similarly, a rear compressed elastic member 74 is interposed between the assembly and the sidewall opposite the window of the chamber. The compressed elastic members interposed between the electrode assembly and the chamber isolate the electrode assembly from any mechanical vibration and thermal distortion of the chamber while maintaining a precise position of the electrode assembly to the chamber window.
