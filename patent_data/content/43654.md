# IMPROVEMENT IN OR RELATING TO SEMICONDUCTOR DIODES AND THEIR FABRICATION

## Abstract
The invention relates to semiconductor diodes for use at high frequencies. The diode is designed to minimise series resistance and particularly spreading resistance which affects the spreading of current through the semiconductor body from a first to a second contact. The inventive diode has a cylindrical or part cylindrical shape wiht the first contact in the form of a stripe along the cyl inder axis surrounded by semiconductor body which in turn is surrounded by the second contact in the form of a cylindrical or part cylindrical shell. An approximation to this form is a prismatic construction, the prism having either a trapezoidal or hexagonal cross sec tion. The current spreading from the first 1 to the second 3 contact thus has a substantially uniform distribution within the semiconductor body which comprises an active semiconduc tor portion 2b and a high conductivity portion 2a . The invention also includes methods for constructing such diodes.
