# Process for coating a substrate with polyimide.

## Abstract
A substrate is provided with a polyimide coating having good planarisation and good mechanical and thermal stabil ity, by applying to the substrate an amino terminated oligomer and an ester, with the oligomer being formed from an aromatic diamine and from an aromatic dianhydride, and by reacting the oligomer and the ester in situ. The ester is formed from an aromatic tetracarboxylic acid and an alcohol, and the ester is such that it reacts with an amine group of the oligomer to form a high molecular weight polyamide at a temperature between 40 C and 140 C, and continues to react to form a cyclic imide.
