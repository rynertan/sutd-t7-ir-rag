# Oil flooded compressor with condensation control system.

## Abstract
An oil flooded compressor 12 system includes a conde nsate control system which monitors air saturation tempera ture and system temperature, and opens a valve 32 in an oil cooler by pass 30 when the system temperature is less than saturation temperature. By passing the oil cooler 20 raises the system temperature until it is above saturation tempera ture or until it reaches a predetermined maximum. Satura tion temperature is computed electronically from signals received from a system pressure transducer 44 , a relative humidity transducer 52 and an ambient temperature trans ducer 50 .
