# Bag type filter apparatus.

## Abstract
The cleaning of a tubular filter bag 14 , when a periodic reverse flow of purging air is directed into the outlet end of the filter bag, is significantly enhanced by providing a hollow diffuser tube 30 interiorly of the filter bag for diffusing and distributing the reverse flow of purging air throughout the filter bag. The hollow diffuser tube 30 extends longitudinally within the tubular supporting cage 26 of the filter bag 14 with one end of the diffuser tube communicating with the outlet end of the filter bag. The diffuser tube has perforations 33 for diffusing and distributing air throughout the filter bag when a periodic reverse flow of purging air is directed into the outlet end of the filter bag and into the diffuser tube.
