# Aldehyde adducts and a process for separating aldehydes involving them.

## Abstract
Linear aldehydes having 7 21 carbon atoms are separated from mixtures which may contain alcohols and or branched aldehydes by converting them into solid adducts with C₂ to C₁₂ linear alkane diols. The adducts are then separated and decomposed. The adducts are themselves novel compounds.
