# Method and system for automatically abstracting, storing and retrieving a document in machine readable form.

## Abstract
Method for automatically abstracting a document in machine readable form consisting in storing in a dictionary memory 8 language terms commonly used in document preparation, comparing language terms from an input document received from an input register 16 with the stored language terms, selecting language terms from input document which do not compare, selecting language terms from input document which compare, coding the selecting language terms with the identity of the input document and storing the language terms in memory 12 . When retrieving a document from storage, the processor 10 under the con trol of instruction memory 14 compares the words in an input query against the word index file in memory 12 and provides in register 18 the selected documents whose iden tification code corresponds to the highest retrieval value cal culated using each identification code of each language term that compares.
