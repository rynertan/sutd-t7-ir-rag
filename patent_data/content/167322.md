# SHADOW MEMORY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A shadow memory system which can survive a rapid sequence of power failures includes a volatile main memory 12 and a shadow memory subsystem 26 which continual ly monitors write accesses to the main memory. The shadow memory subsystem includes a disk drive 62 storing a copy of the data in main memory. As the main memory contents are altered, the shadow memory is continually updated to reiterate the changes while externally supplied power is available. In the event of a main power failure, backup power is required to store main memory data in the shadow memory for only a few storage locations for which the updating of the shadow memory may lag behind the changes in the main memory.
