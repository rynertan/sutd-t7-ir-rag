# Hot isostatic pressing apparatus.

## Abstract
A hot isostatic pressing apparatus comprising a pressure vessel 5 , heater 9 and heat insulating layer 10, 20 inter posed between the wall of the pressure vessel 5 and the heater 9 . The heat insulating layer 10, 20 is formed of a least two layers, ie an inner layer 10 and an outer layer 20 . The inner layer 10 surrounds an object M , which is under treatment, and the heater 9 . The inner layer 10 is loadable into and unloadable from the pressure vessel 4 together with the object M and heater 9 while maintaining a chamber, which is surrounded by the inner laver 10 , hermetically isolated from the surrounding atmosphere. However, the outer layer 20 remains within the pressure vessel 5 . When the hot isostatic pressing apparatus is incorporated in a modular HIP system, the cooling time is considerable shortened and the ef ficiency of the HIP treatment is hence improved to a consider able extent.
