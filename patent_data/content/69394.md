# Manufacture of resin extended pigments.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for preparing resin extended pigments containing from 10 to 75 and preferably 25 to 50 by weight, based on the amount of pigment and resin present. The crude pigment and resin are premilled dry, such as in a ball mill, in a manner equivalent to that used to prepare small particle size highly aggregated pigment. Following premilling the pigment and resin are milled in an organic liquid capable of ripening the pigment particles to pigmentary size or simply improving their crystallinity which organic liquid at 30 C can dissolve no more than 5 g l and preferably no more than 2 g l of the resin.
