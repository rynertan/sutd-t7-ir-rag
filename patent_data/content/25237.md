## Description
METHOD FOR PRODUCING STRONTIUM NITRATE This invention relates to the production of strontium chemicals. More particularly, the invention is concerned with a process of manufacturing strontium nitrate from strontium sulfate. Strontium nitrate is an industrial chemical whose principal use is for producing red fire in pyrotechnics such as railroad fuses, emergency flares, signal rockets and fireworks. It is a white crystalline compound existing in two forms the anhydrous Sr NO3 2 and the tetrahydrate Sr NO3 2.4H2O . The anhydrous is the form which is normally manufactured for commercial purposes. Strontium compounds including the nitrate are normally derived from celestite SrSO4 , a naturally occurring strontium sulfate and the most abundant of strontium ores. The first step leading toward strontium nitrate is the conversion of the strontium sulfate to the carbonate, the key intermediate from which all other strontium salts are prepared. There are two commercial processes for converting celestite to the versatile carbonate derivative the black ash method and the metathesis method. In the black ash method, celestite ore is reduced in a rotary kiln to strontium sulfide and carbon dioxide by the following reaction SrSO4 4CO SrS 4CO2The black ash is then leached and the resulting strontium sulfide solution treated with a soluble carbonate to precipitate the strontium carbonate by the following reaction SrS Na2CO3 SrCO3 Na2SThe insoluble precipitate is separated and washed while the aqueous solution is evaporated to give a technical grade of sodium sulfide.In the metathesis method, a slurry qf celestite ore is heated in a solution of an alkali metal carbonate whereby the following metathetical reaction occurs SrSO4 Na2CO3 Na2 SO4 SrCO The precipitated strontium carbonate is separated from the sodium sulfate solution, washed and dried sodium sulfate is recovered as a by product. As to the relative merits of the two processes, the black ash method has the advantage of providing an inherently high quality product requiring little or no additional purification. Thus, essentially a pure strontium sulfide solution is obtained on leaching the reaction mass and this solution on treatment with sodium carbonate gives high purity strontium carbonate.However, the black ash method is capital intensive requiring considerable investment in high temperature rotary kilns. The metathesis method, on the other hand, can be carried in low cost equipment since the reaction occurs at relatively low temperature. Typically, it can be performed by boiling a slurry of celestite in aqueous sodium carbonate. The drawback with the metathesis method is that the strontium carbonate is contaminated with other alkaline earth carbonates, notably barium, calcium, and magnesium. These usually occur in celestite ore and must be removed or reduced to a sufficiently low level whereby they do not interfere or dilute the scarlet red flame coloration of strontium nitrate prepared from the strontium carbonate. The removal of calcium and barium impurities calls for treating the crude strontium carbonate with aqueous washes in large purification vessels to extract the barium and calcium salts after which the washed precipitate is filtered and dried.For a more detailed discussion on the commercial production of the strontium carbonate by the metathesis method, reference is made to Strontium Chemicals inChemical and Metallurgical Engineering, January 1946 pages 152 to 155 . In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method of producing purified strontium nitrate, suitable for use in pyrotechnics, from strontium sulfate celestite which comprises a converting the strontium sulfate to strontium carbonate by heating a suspension of the strontium sulfate in a solution of an alkali metal carbonate whereby there is formed a precipitate of crude strontium carbonate and a solution of an alkali metal sulfate washing the precipitate with water to substantially remove the alkali metal sulfate and give a washed precipitate of crude strontium carbonate b forming a strontium nitrate solution by adding nitric acid to an aqueous suspension of the washed precipitate from step a whereby carbonate is converted to nitrate c treating the strontium nitrate solution from b with an alkaline metal hydroxide whereby heavy metals and a substantial amount to an essentially total amount of magnesium are precipitated as hydroxides. d producing a clarified strontium nitrate solution by separating any insoluble material from the solution of step c e subjecting the clarified strontium nitrate solution of step d to evaporative crystallization to selectively form strontium nitrate crystals f separating the strontium nitrate crystals in step e to give isolated strontium nitrate crystals and mother liquor and optionally g returning the mother liquor in step f to the evaporative crystallization stage in step e , while sufficiently purging the mother liquor with a purge stream to prevent impurities therein from reaching a level at which they co crystallize with the strontium nitrate h washing the isolated strontium nitrate crystals in step f to remove adhering mother liquor and give purified strontium nitrate crystals and wash water. The primary advantage of the invention is that it provides an integrated method of producing strontium nitrate from celestite by way of strontium carbonate based on the metathetical reaction of celestite with an alkali metal carbonate without removing other alkaline earth carbonates from the intermediate strontium carbonate prior to converting it to strontium nitrate. In carrying out the herein process, strontium sulfate is converted to strontium carbonate by the known metathesis method of reacting strontium sulfate with an alkali metal carbonate. The source of the strontium sulfate is finely milled celestite ore which is slurried with an aqueous solution of the alkali metal carbonate.The alkali metal carbonate is desirably sodium carbonate although other members of the series are satisfactory, such as potassium carbonate and sodium sesquicarbonate or trona. Preferred and extended operating conditions for conducting the metathesis reaction are summarized below. Preferred Extended Range RangePressure, atm. 0.8 1.2 0.6 10Temperature, ec 93 105 85 181 Ore to Total Slurry Weight 20 25 5 40Excess Soda Ash, 2 4 0 30Ore particle size, micron 10 30 1 1 50 Residence time, hr. 0.75 1.5 0.3 6Fine grinds of celestite ore promote faster reaction times but excessively fine powder may result in a strontium carbonate precipitate which is difficult to separate and free of entrained liquor. After the metathesis is complete, the precipitated strontium carbonate is separated from the reaction mixture and washed to remove adhering sodium sulfate solution. Sufficient washing is required to reduce the sodium content to about 0.7 to 1.0 dry weight basis . About 6 to 10 displacement washes or equivalent thereof will bring the sodium assay within the prescribed range.The sodium content must be controlled to minimize yellow contamination of the red flame of the pyrotechnic material. Separation is effected by such well known procedures as filtration or centrifugation using equipment available from commercial manufacturers either a belt filter or solid bowl centrifuge is satisfactory. A rotary filter has a tendency to pick up only fine particles and is thus not recommended unless the grind should contain considerable amounts of material below 10 microns. The washed damp cake of crude strontium carbonate has a water content which normally varies from about 15 to 43 , preferably about 20 25 . The composition of the crude material dry weight basis will vary, depending on the assay of the celestite ore.A representative strontium carbonate damp cake analysis on a substantially dry weight basis runs as follows 86 SrCO3 8 CaCO3 2 MgCO3 2 Na2 SO4 1.5 Inerts 18 BaCO3 0.5 BaSO4 0.1 Na2CO3 The crude strontium carbonate wet cake is placed in a vessel of water and the mixture thoroughly agitated.To the resulting suspension was added concentrated 69 nitric acid thereby forming strontium nitrate. Since the damp cake contains alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates, the nitrates of these metals will be formed along with the strontium nitrate. The principal reactions can be depicted by the following equations SrCO3 2HNO3 Sr NO3 2 H2O CO2 BaCO3 2HNO3 Ba NO3 2 H2O CO2 MgC03 2HNO3 Mg N03 2 H2O CO2 CaC03 2HNO3 Ca N03 2 H20 CO2 Na2CO3 2HNO3 2NaN03 H20 CO2 Treatment of the strontium carbonate suspension with nitric acid is desirably effected at mildly elevated temperatures such as from about 40 C to 90 C. Sufficient nitric acid is used to insure conversion of the carbonates into nitrates. A convenient procedure is to continue adding the nitric acid until evolution of carbon dioxide has ceased at which point the reaction is essentially complete. Any excess acidity is neutralized by treatment with a further quantity of strontium carbonate wet cake to bring the pH to about 3 to 4. Calcium hydroxide is next added to increase the pH to about 7 to 8 thereby precipitating the hydroxides of any heavy metals which are present in the nitrate solution considerable magnesium hydroxide is also precipitated, normally about 25 to 75 , typically about 50 .The amount of water in which the strontium carbonate wet cake is suspended can vary over wide limits since the reaction with nitric acid proceeds satisfactorily whether the suspension is dilute or concentrated.Sufficient water should, of course, be present to insure dissolution of the metal nitrates. The concentration of the wet cake slurry is adjusted to give a solids content dry basis of from about 0.5 to 6 , preferably about 1 to about 3 . The crude strontium nitrate solution is freed of any insoluble matter. This is effected, for example, by adding diatomaceous earth or similar filter aid material to the solution and passing it through a pressure leaf filter. The temperature during filtration is held to the range of about 40 C to about 100 C, preferably about 60 C to about 80 C filter aid amounts to about 0.1 to about 0.58 by weight of slurry preferably about 0.1 to about 0.2 displacement washes amount to about 0 5, preferably 2 to 3. The resulting clarified strontium nitrate solution generally falls within the following assay, with variations amounting to about 10 by weight 39 Sr NO3 2 6 Ca NO3 2 1 NaN03 1 Mg No3 2 0.4 Ba NO3 2 rem. water The clarified strontium nitrate solution is subjected to evaporative crystallization at temperatures between 60 90 C, preferably between 65 75 C to give solid strontium nitrate crystals. These are separated, washed to remove adhering mother liquor and dried. The resulting material is a high quality pyrotechnical grade of crystalline anhydrous strontium nitrate.A representative product typically assays as follows 98.0 Sr NO3 2 1.0 Ba N03 2 0.35 Ca NO3 2 350 ppm Na NO3 2 550 ppm Mg NO3 2 That pyrotechnical quality strontium nitrate can be crystallized from strontium nitrate solution produced directly from impure strontium carbonate wet cake is surprising. A more likely expectation is that the strontium nitrate produced in this manner would be contaminated with other alkaline earth metal nitrates present in the crystallizer solution and, thus have inferior pyrotechnical properties. For instance, sodium and calcium salts in strontium nitrate lighten the scarlet red flame the green coloration of barium salts distorts it. The purity of strontium nitrate manufactured in accordance with the herein process is maintained by controlling the compositions of the mother liquor. Generally speaking, satisfactory product quality is realized by controlling impurities in the mother liquor at or below about the following typical mother liquor composition 37 Ca NO3 2 8 NaNO3 6 Sr NO3 2 5 Mg NO3 2 Ca 200 ppm Ba NO3 2 The process of the invention can be performed as a batch or continuous operation. In either case, however, the mother liquor must be monitored and purged to prevent impurities from building up to levels where they coprecipitate with the strontium nitrate. By holding the composition of the mother liquor at or near the assay aforesaid, strontium nitrate of excellent pyrotechnical quality is obtained. The rate of purge is conveniently based on the amount of clarified strontium nitrate solution being fed into the crystallizer. A purge of 16 by weight of the input nitrate solution normally suffices to keep the mother liquor in the vicinity of optimum composition provided the sodium in the strontium carbonate wet cake is maintained at about the preferred level of about 0.7 to 1.0 . The purge rate can also be expressed in terms of Kg Kg of dry product, in which case the rate is in the range of 0.30 to 0.50, preferably 0.35 to 0.50. Of course, the purge rate will vary depending on the celestite ore assay. The purge stream is piped into a shallow, lined pond where evaporation reduces the volume of waste solution. However, because nitrate salts are highly hydroscopic, the rate of evaporation is retarded, particularly under humid conditions, and solution volume may present a waste storage and handling problem. This can be greatly alleviated by adding a precipitating agent to the purge stream, prior to conducting it to the pond, whereby the metal nitrates are converted into insoluble compounds which are separated and the substantially solids free filtrate sent to the pond. Examples of precipitating agents include soluble sulfate such as sulfuric acid which forms highly insoluble strontium and calcium sulfates which are removed by filtration and transferred to a solids disposal site. Soluble carbonates such as sodium carbonate are also effective precipitation agents forming insoluble strontium, calcium and magnesium carbonates which are separated and disposed of similarly to the insoluble metal sulfates. The aqueous filtrate, being free of hydroscopic solids, has a higher rate of evaporation and accordingly, the volume of purge liquor can be held down to acceptable levels. Reference is now made to the following non limiting examples. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Strontium Carbonate A 1000 cc resin flask fitted with agitator and reflux condenser was charged with 585 g water 195 g celestite ore 200 mesh 106 g Na2CO3 stoichiometric The celestite ore had the following analysis 88.2B SrSO4 1.5e BaSO4 7.6 CaCO3 2.4 MgCO3 0.1 SiO2 0.2 R203 The mixture was heated by refluxing X100 C for 3 hours.

At the end of this time the slurry was filtered.Analysis of the strontium carbonate wet cake indicated that 95 conversion of the sulfate was achieved. EXAMPLE 3 Preparation of Clarified Strontium Nitrate Solution Crude carbonate wet cake 26.8 kg containing 20 water prepared by metathesis in the manner of the previous examples was suspended in 9 liters of dilution water contained in an agitated vessel. The contents were heated to 650C and 69 nitric acid added slowly until the evolution of CO2 ceased. A total of 23.1 kg of 69 nitric acid was added. Strontium carbonate 114 g was added to bring the pH to 4.6 and was followed by the addition of 230 g ofCa OH 2 to bring the pH to 7.4. To this slurry was added 0.1 diatomaceous earth filter aid. The slurry was then readily filtered in a pressure leaf filter yielding a filtrate which was clear and gave the following analysis 38.7 Sr NO3 2 6.2 Ca NO3 2 1.2 NaNO3 1.1 Mg NO3 2 0.4 Ba NO3 2 52.4 water by difference The wet cake, containing 26.1 water, was readily discharged from the filter press and handled well.Approximately, 2.1 kg of solids were obtained for every 100 kg of slurry. EXAMPLE 4 Continuous Production of Strontium Nitrate A clarified nitrate solution having an average concentration of that prepared in Example 3 was fed continuously to a 1500 cc agitated vessel crystallizer.About 1000 cc of slurry was contained in the vessel.The crystallization was carried out at 70 C and 19.3 kPa. Product crystals of strontium nitrate were continuously removed and mother liquor returned to maintain a constant solids concentration in the crystallizer. When the concentration of calcium nitrate in the mother liquor reached 35 a portion of the mother liquor was continuously purged at the rate of 0.07 cc purge cc condensate. Product crystals were water washed at the rate 0.1 kg wash water kg product strontium nitrate. At the end of this operation in which 61.1 kg of water had been removed during crystallization the washed product crystals had the following analysis 0.04 NaNO3 0.02 Mg NO3 2 0.4 Ca NO3 2 0.99 Ba NO3 2 rem. Sr NO3 2 The dried crystals were well defined with an average particle size of about 50 mesh and free flowing.Pyrotechnical compositions prepared therefrom produced a brilliant crimson flame. The mother liquor at this point had the following composition 8.5 NaNO3 1.6 Mg NO3 2 35.7 Ca NO3 2 9.2 Sr NO3 2 247 ppm Ba NQ3 2 This example demonstrates that pyrotechnical quality can be prepared from crude strontium carbonate wet cake by the process of the present invention EXAMPLE 5 Preparation of Strontium Carbonate This example illustrates that sodium bicarbonate can be used as the alkali metal carbonate in the metathesis reaction. Sodium bicarbonate 84 g was slowly added to 566.5 g of water while stirring and heating. Then 91.85 g of SrSO4 was added and the mixture allowed to reflux at 900C for 2 hours. A sample was taken and the solids filtered off and repulped twice with water. These solids when suspended in water and treated with concentrated nitric acid went into solution indicating complete conversion to the carbonate. A 2 cc aliquot of the filtrate required 7.9 cc of 0.0098 N HCl to the phenolphthalein end point, indicating a residual carbonate concentration of 0038 M. This data shows that the reaction is essentially complete. The reaction proceeds according to the following equation.

The solids and filtrate were then obtained and treated in the manner described in Example 5 with results indicating that complete reaction of the sulfate to the carbonate had occurred according to 3 2 SrSO4 NaHCO3 3 a2CO3 2 3 2 3 2 SrCO3 3 2 Na2SO4 1 2 CO2 5 2 H2O Treatment of Mother Liquor Purge Stream EXAMPLE 7 This example demonstrates how calcium contamination can be removed from crystallizer mother liquor by treatment with sulfuric acid. A solution approximately simulating crystallizer mother liquor having the following composition by weight 25.8 Ca NO3 2 5.9 NaNO3 4.4 Sr NO3 2 3.7 Mg NO3 2 was prepared. This solution had a specific gravity of 1.355 g cc at 27.5 C. A 100 cc sample of this mother liquor weighing 135.5 g was treated with a stoichimetric amount of 20 H2SO4 118.5 g . Calcium and strontium cations precipitated out as the sulfate which was filtered off. The filtrate had the following analysis using atomic absorption by weight 0.79 Na 0.338 Mg 590 ppm Sr 0.82 Ca This shows how the calcium and other soluble metal salts can be substantially reduced to give a low solids mother liquor. The filtrate of dilute nitric acid can be concentrated and recycled to the nitration stage. EXAMPLE 8 This example demonstrates the preparation of commercial quality sodium nitrate from the crystallizer mother liquor purge solution by treatment with sodium carbonate. A 100 cc sample weighing 135.5 g of simulated crystallizer mother liquor having the composition stated in the previous example was treated with a stoichiometric amount of Na2CO2 29 g to precipitate the carbonates of calcium, strontium and magnesium. The soda ash was added in 5 g increments and the pH after 30 minutes recorded to give the following values Na2CO3 Added pH After Grams 30 Min. 0 4.3 5 5.7 10 5.8 15 5.8 20 5.9 25 6.3 30 8.1Thus, pH could be used as an indicator of the extent of reaction. After soda ash addition was complete, the solids were filtered off and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness to yield crystals which X ray refraction analysis indicated was virtually pure sodium nitrate. Atomic absorption on the dry solids gave the following analysis 0.15 Mg 0.11 Sr 120 ppm Ca indicating a fairly pure sodium nitrate had been prepared. These examples demonstrate how magnesium contamination can be removed from crystallizer feed solution by treatment with Ca OH 2.
