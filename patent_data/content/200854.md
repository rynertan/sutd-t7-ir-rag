# Phosphazene homopolymers and copolymers having hydroxylated or amino derivatives of carbazole or of naphthalene as substituents.

## Abstract
Polyphosphazene homopolymers and copolymers containing repetitive units represented by the general formula CHEM in which the substituents X, which can be equal or different, are represented by the following formulas CHEM CHEM CHEM where R is hydrogen or a C1 C5 alkyl group or an aryl or heterocyclic group, with or without substituents, R is CH2 or an aryl or heterocyclic group, with or without substituents, n is zero or a whole number variable from 1 to 5 and Y is hydrogen or a halogen or a methyl, nitroso or nitro group the substituents X 1 are groups equal to X or halogen, or alkoxy, aryloxy, amino or mercapto groups, either substituted or unsubstituted, or a mixture thereof the sum w y z has a value varying from 20 to 50,000. The polymers of the present invention are prepared from the corresponding poly dichlorophosphazenes of general formula NPCl2 m in which m can vary from 20 to 50,000, and can be used as photoconductor materials and for other uses.
