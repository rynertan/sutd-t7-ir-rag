## Description
DESCRIPTION ELECTROHEMICAL CELL OEtL11 This invention relates to electrochemical cells and in particular to a safety, non resealable vent for galvanic cells, such as nonaqueous cells. In the past, several different types of pressure relief vent valves have been used for releasing internal gas pressure from inside a sealed galvanic cell. Devices such as safety valves, rupture membranes, shearing plugs, sharp points which are forced through sheets, etc. have been employed. Recently low pressure relief vents have been disclosed using glass to metal and ceramicoto metal hermetic seals which crack after a low pressure buildup occurs within a cell. Although pressure venting devices are available to safety vent pressurized materials from within sealed cells, there are not many devices that quickly and safely vent when cells are exposed to high temperature enviromzents, such as when they are discarded into incinerators.Consequently, cells having suitable high or low pressure relief vent valves when placed in incinerators may not have enough time for the vent to properly function and thus could result in some of the cells detonating. This is particularly true of some of the newer cells systems as for example nonaqueous cell systems employing liquid cathode material such as oxyhalides. One type of tem erSture sensitive vent which is designed for use as รง one tine safety device, consists of a plug of a material sensitive to high temperatures which is placed in a preformed aperture and nexts upon exposure to a high temperature condition. however, these tettiperature sensitive devices are generally difficult to assemble on a production bvs s. It is therefore, at obJect of the present invention to provide, in an electrochemical cell, a safety non resealable vent closure that is actuated upon being exposed to a high temperature environment. According to the present invention there is provided an electrochemical cell in which the active components of the cell are assembled within a housing comprising a container sealed at its open end by a cover and having at least one vent orifice in said housing and a sheet disposed over the vent orifice and secured and sealed about said vent orifice using a low temp era ture fusible material such that upon being exposed to a predetermined temperature level the fusible material will melt providing a permanent vent in the cell container. By use of the present invention there may be provided a safety non resealable temperature sensitive vent means that is inexpensive to manufacture, easy to assemble and compact. If desired the sheet could be preattached by a partial or spot weld and then fully sealed by the fusible material. Preferably the sheet could be a disc disposed and secured and sealed over an orifice positioned at the bottom of a cylindrical cell. As used herein a low temperature fusible material is one that is capable of providing a hermetic seal for the sheet with the cell s housing and melting at a temperature above 190 S . Preferably, the material should melt below 3000P and above 200 for most applications.The selection of the particular fusible material will depend upon what temperature the material is required to melt, along with, its chemical compatibility with the particular cell system it is to be used with and along with its ability to wet the materials of the sheet and housing. suitable fusible materials would include metal alloys such as bismuth le3d containing alloys, bismuth tin containing alloys, bismuth cadmium containing alloys, and the like as generally known in the art and high temperature plastics, e.g. polyimide and the like. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one vent orifice would be placed at the bottom of a cylindrical container of a cell and then a disc would be secured and hermetically sealed over the orifice using a low melting point fusible material such as a bismuth lead alloy. Thus when the cell is inadvertently exposed to a high temperature environment as exists in an incinerator, the fusible material will melt and provide a permanent vent in the cell thus possibly preventing the cell from detonating. The sheet for use in this invention could be selected from materials such as stainless steel, nickels steel, tin coated steels, etc. and could assume any irregular or regular configuration such as a circle, square, etc. The safety non resealable temperature sensitive vent closure of this invention preferably can be employed with all size cells and is ideally suited for liquid cathode cell systems employing, for example, a liquid oxyhalide. A cell for use in this invention can be the split internal anode outer cathode collector construction as described in U.S. Patent 4,032,696 or the split internal cathode collector constructed as described in U.S. Patent 4,048,389, said U.S. Patents 4,032,696 and 4,048,389 being incorporated herein by reference. Suitable nonaqueous liquid cathode materials for use in cells of this invention could be one or more of the liquid oxyhalides of an element of Group V or GroupVI of the Periodic Table and or one or more of the halides of an element of Group IV to Group VI of the PeriodicTable, said Periodic marble being the Periodic Table ofElements as set forth on the inside back cover of theHandbook of Chemistry and Physics, 48th Edition, The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, Ohio, 1967 1968.For example, such nonaqueous cathode materials would include sulfuryl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosphorus GXy chloride, thionyl bromide, chromyl chloride, vanadyl tribromide, selenium oxy chloride, sulfur monochloride, sulfur monobromide, selenium tetrafluorides selenium monobromide, thiophosphoryl chloride, thiophosphoryl bromide, vanadium pentafluoride, lead tetrachloride, titanium tetrachloride, disulfur decafluoride, tin bromide trichloride, tin dibromide dichloride and tin tribromide chloride. Another suitable cathode material would be liquid sulfur dioxide. Anodes suitable for use in nonaqueous liquid cathode cell systems can be generally consumable metals and include the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and alloys of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals with each other and other metals. The term talloy as used herein is intended to include mixtures solid solutions such as lithius magnesil1m and intermetallic compounds such as lithium monoaluminide. The preferred anode materials are the alkali metals and particularly lithium, sodium and potassium. Jhen using lithium anodes the anode may be coated with a vinyl resin as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,993,501, said patent incorporated herein by reference. The cathode collector for use in liquid cathode cell systems has to be electronically conductive so as to permit external electrical contact to be made with the active cathode material and also provide extended area reaction sites for the cathodic electrochemical process of the cell. materials suitable for use as a cathode collector are carbon materials and metals such as nickel, with acetylene black being pre erable. In addition, the cathode collector when made of a carticulwe material should be capable of being molded directly within a can or capable of being molded into various size discrete bodies that can be handled without cracking or breaking.To impart a cohesive characteristic to some types of cathode collectors, such as carbonaceous cathode collectors, a suitable binder material, with or without plasticizers and with or without stabilizers, can be added to the cathode collector materials. Suitable binder materials for this purpose may include vinyl polymers, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyacrylics, polystyrene and the like. For example, polytetrafluoroethylene would be the preferred binder for cathode collectors for use with liquid oxyhalide cathodes.The binder, if required, should be added in an amount between about 5, and about 305 by weight of the molded cathode collector since an amount less than 5 would not provide sufficient strength to the molded body while an amount larger than 3O5 would wet proof the surface of the carbon and or reduce the available surface of the carbon, thereby reducing the activation site areas required for the cathodic electrochemical process of the cell.Preferably, the binder should be between 10 and 25 by weight of the cathode collector. Cf importance in selecting the materials for the cathode collector is to select materials that will be chemically stable in the cell system in which they are to be used. A solute for use in liquid cathode cell systems may be a simple or double salt which will produce an ionically conductive solution when dissolved is a suitable solvent. reef erred solutes for nonaqueous systems are complexes of inorganic or organic lexis acids and inorganic ionizable salts. The only requirements for utility are that the salt, wether simple or complex, be compatible with the solvent being employed and that it yield a solution which is ionically conductive. According to the lexis or electronic concept of acids and bases, many substances which contain no active hydrogen can act as acids or acceptors of electron doublets.The basic concept is set forth in the chemical literature Journal of the Eranklin Institute, Vol.226, July December, 1938, pages 293,313 by G.N. Lewis . A suggested reaction mechanism for the manner in which these complexes function in a solvent is described in detail in U.S. Patent 3,542,602 wherein it is suggested that the complex or double salt formed between the Lexis acid and the ionizable salt yields an entity which is more stable than either of the components alone. Typical Lexis acids suitable for use in conjunction with liauid oxyhalide cathodes include aluminum fluoride, aluminum bromide, aluminum chloride, antimony penta chloride, zirconium tetrachloride, phosphorus pentachloride, boron fluoride, boron chloride and boron bromide. Ionizable salts useful in combination with the lexis acids include lithium fluoride, lithium chloride, lithium bromide, lithium sulfide, sodium fluoride, sodium chloride, sodium bromide, potassium fluoride, potassium chlorice and potassium bromide. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the double salts formed by a lexis acid and an ionizable salt may be used as such or the individual components may be added to the solvent separately to form the salt or the resulting ions in situ. One such double salt, for example, is that formed by the combination of aluminum chloride and lithium chloride to yield lithium aluminum tetrachlonde. If desired, and specifically for the halides, a cosolvent should be added to the liquid active reducible cathode and solute solution to alter the dielectric constant, viscosity or solvent properties of the solution to achieve better conductivity. Some examples of suitable cosolvents are nitrobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, 1, 3 dioxolane, 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone, propylene carbonate, g butyrolactone, sulfolane, ethylene glycol sulfite, dimethyl sulfite, beazolyl chloride, dimethoxyethane, dimethyl isoxazole, diethyl carbonate, sulfur dioxide and the like. Suitable separators for use with liquid cathodes in nonaqueous cells suitable for use in nonaqueous liquid cathode cell systems are the nonwoven glass separators, preferably those separators that incorporate long glass fibers along with the short glass fibers since such a combination increases the tear strength of the separators thereby making them easier to handle. The container of the cell could be made of stainless steel, iron, nickel, plastic, coated metals or some other suitable material. Some preferred combinations of nonaqueous cathode materials and anodes would be as follows 1 sulfuryl chloride Li or Na 2 thionyl chloride Li or Na 3 phosphorus oxychloride Li or Na 4 sulfur monochloride Li or Na 5 sulfur monobromide Li or Na 6 selenium tetrafluoride Li or Na Preferably, the cells for use in this invention would be liquid oxyhalide cells using sulfuryl chloride, thionyl chloride or mixtures thereof with a lithium anode. It is to be understood that the safety vent closure of this invention could be used in other cell systems such as, for example, Leclanche dry cells, zinc chloride cells, lithium ,tnG2 cells, nickel cadmium cells, and le acid cells. The present invention will become more apparent from the following description thereof when considered together with the accompanying drawing which is set forth as being exemplary of embodiments of the present invention and is not intended in any way to be limitative thereof and wherein. Figure 1 is a perspective view of disc for use in this invention. Figure 2 is a perspective view of a cell container inverted so that the bottom of the container is shown with a vent orifice disposed at its center. Figure 3 is a partial cross sectional view of the container shown in Figure 2 with the disc shown inFigure 1 secured and sealed over the vent orifice using a low melting point fusible material. Referring in detail to Figures 1 through 3, a disc 2 is secured and sealed to the bottom 4 of container 6 over vent orifice 8 using a fusible material 10 such as a low temperature fusible metal alloy. If desired, the disc could be secured and sealed within the container for some applications. Thus when the container 6 houses a cell system such as lithium oxyhalide system, and is exposed to a high temperature environment as exists in an incinerator, the fusible material will melt producing a permanent vent in the cell. This may prevent possible detonation of some cells when exposed to high temperature condition. The invention will now be further described by reference to the following examples. Example 1 Fusible metal alloys were prepared as shon in the table. The approximate melting point of the fusible metal alloys are also shown in the table.

Some cells of each type were subjected to an abuse test of a two ampere charge and they vented through the bottom orifice without detonating. Some cells of each type were heated by a direct flame and venting occurred depending on the location of the flame. If the flame was directed near the bottom, the cell vented through the bottom orifice. however, if the flame was directed against the side or top of the cell, the cell detonated.In a sand bath test where the entire cells were exposed to a high temperature, the cells generally vented through the bottom orifice but one cell denoted for some unexplained reason. It is to be understood that although the present invention has been described with reference to particular details thereof, it is not intended that these details shall be construed as limiting the scope of this invention.
