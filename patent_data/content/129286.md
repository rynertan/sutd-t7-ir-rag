## Description
Remote control system comprising a control member comprising a display field and position sensing means which are coupled thereto. The invention relates to a remote control system for the selective control of a plurality of user apparatus, said remote control system comprising a cooperating control member and a control device, said control memBer supporting control keys which are assembled in at least a first set which comprises control keys for the selection o an apparatus from said plurality, and a second set which comprises groups of control keys, each group comprising control keys for the control of a given apparatus, said remote control system furtherzate comprising a wireless transmission device for transmitting znstrucXions generated by the operation of the control keys to the apparatus of said plurality. A remote control system of this kind is known from Gerir ar Patent Specification No. 2,346,262. The remote control system described therein is suitable for the control of either a television receiver or a radio receiver. The control member supports control keys in the form of pushbuttons which are physically present on tne control member. The first set of control keys comprises a selector switch which can be set either to the position television or to the position radio. The second set of control keys comprises a first group of control keys for the control of the radio receiver and a second group of control keys for the control of the television receiver.When operating the remote control system, a user first selects which one of the t o apparatus is to be controlled before selecting the desired function of the selected apparatus. The control device translates the information of the selected control key for presentation to the transmission device which in its turn transmits this information to the selected apparatus in order to execute the desired function therein. A remote control system in accordance with the invention is preferably used in an environment in which several apparatus which are suitable for wireless remote control are present. Particulary attractive in this respect is a domestic environment where it z Duid be advantageous to perform the remote control of all user apparatus in a house, for example video equipment television, video tape recorder, etc. , audio equipment radio receiver, tape recording apparatus, etc. , and also other appliances such as, for example an electrical microwave oven, the heating system, or the garage door, by means of a single, compact control member. It is a drawback of the known remote control systems for a plurality of apparatus that when the apparatus to be controlled offers a large variety of selections for example, a stereo television receiver with teletext etc. or when several apparatus are to be controlled by one and the same remote control itember, the number of control keys to be accommodate on the control device becomes very high when the keys are formed by pushbuttons which are physically present on the control 1L LdrL, so that the layout of such a control meiker becomes obscure and the ease of operation is reduced. It is the object of the invention to provide a remote control system in which this dra.jback is mitigated. To this end, a remote control system in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the control member comprises a display field whereto position sensing means are coupled in order to determine a position indicated on the display field by a user, said position sensing means cooperating with the control device which comprises a data processor unit, said control member also comprising a display field control means which has an output which is connected to a control input of the display field and an input which serves to receive control signals generated by the data processor unit, said display field control means serving to display, under the control of a first control signal, control keys of the first set On the display field and to display, under the control of a second control signal, control keys of a group of the second set on the display field, said first control signal being generated upon activation of the remote control system by a user, said second control signal being generated on the basis of a position signal which is generated by the position sensing means and which indicates the position of the control key of the first set which is indicated by the user. Because the control keys are no longer physically present but are displayed on the display field instead, it is possible to present only those control keys to a user which are necessary for the control operation to be performed.Thanks to the fact that first a menu of all apparatus which can be controlled is displayed at the request of the user achieved by the display of the control keys of the first set , the user can select the apparatus to he controlled. After selection of the apparatus to be controlled by the user, only the control keys of the selected apparatus are displayed, i.e. the relevant group of the second set.The layout of the control keys on the control member thus always remains convenient. Furthermore, thanks to the use of position sensing means which are coupled to the display field, the user need indicate only the selected control key on the display field in order to indicate the control instruction the position sensing means subsewuently determine the indicated position, thus recognizing the indicated control key. The control device then ensures that the function associated with the indicated control key is executed. A first preferred embodiment of a remote control system in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the control mber and the control device are connected to a common bus for the transport of signals, the data processor unit being connected to a memory in which control key information is stored for generating the control keys of the first and the second set to be displayed. Because the control member and the control device are connected to a common bus, all intelligence is locally present in a remote control device.The control keys are displayed in that the data processor unit fetches control key information from the memory for presentation to the display field control means. A further preferred embodiment of a remote control system in accordance with the invention is characterized in that the control member comprises a receiving device, an output of the position sensing means being connected to an input of the transmission device whilst an output of the receiving device is connected to an input of the display field control means, the control device comprising an internal bus for the transport of signals whereto the data processor unit and a further wireless transmitter receiver are connected, said data processor unit being connected to a memory for the storage of control key information and for generating the control keys of the first and the second set to be displayed, the transmission device and the receiving device on the one side and the further transmitter receiver on the other side being interactive. The control device and the control member thus represent an independent unit each. The exchange of information between the control device and the control member takes place via their relevant transmitter receiver. The remote control member now comprises ordy f components, because the intelligence is present in the control device. The control keys are displayed in that the data processor generates control key information in conjunction with the memory for presentation to the display field control means via the further transmitter receiver. In a remote control system in which the control device and the control member form independent units, the control device is preferably connected to an external bus whereto each apparatus of said plurality of apparatus is connected. The control device is thus directly connected to all apparatus. In a remote control system in which the control device and the control member form independent units, the data processor unit preferably generates a presence signal under the control of said activation of the remote control system in order to check the presence of the apparatus connected to the external bus. Thus, the control keys of the first set are displayed only for the apparatus which are indeed present, and not those for apparatus which are temporarily absent. A further preferred embodiment of a remote control system in accordance with the invent Ion is characterized in t st the display field control means is suitable to modify, under the control of a third control signal received from the data processor unit, at least one control key of said group of the second set while maintaining its identity, said third control signal being generated on the basis of a further position signal which is generated by the position sensing means and which indicates the position of the control key of the displayed group of the second set indicated by the user.It can thus be indicated to the user which control key has been activated and, moreover, when a control key is concerned which comprises several positions or a control key with continuous control, which change of position has been made. The invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the drawing therein Figure 1 shows an example of the appearance of a remote control member in accordance with the invention Figure 2 shows an example of a first menu of control keys to be displayed on the display field of the remote control member Figure 3 shows an example of a second menu of control keys to be displayed on the display field of the remote control member Figure 4 shows an example of an embodiment of a remote control of the first type Figure 5 illustrates the operation of a remote control of the first type on the basis of a flo hart Figure 6 shows the position sensing means and the display field control means Figure 7 shows an example of an embodiment of a control member of the second type Figure 8 shows the corrtn 1n bus and the apparatus to be controlled which are connected thereto Figure 9 shows an embodiment of a control device Figure 10 illustrates the operation of a remote control of the second type on the basis of a flowchart. The control keys of the remote control system to be described hereinafter are formed by soft keys , that is to say keys which are formed by temporary display on a display field forming part of the control member Figure 1 shows an example of the appearance of the control member for carrying out the invention. The control member 11 has the format of a small box and has a low weight. The ergonomics of the control member are such that it easily fits in the palm of the hand of a user. bloreover, at its upper side the control member comprises a display field 12 in which symbols, text and notably control keys are displayed during a control operation. The display field is formed, for example, by a dot matrix LCD liquid crystal display .The display field is coupled to position sensing means for determining a position indicated on the display field. The position sensing means comprise, for example a sensitive layer, for example a capacitive sensitive layer or a resistance layer. The sensitive layer is transparent and is illustrated in Figure 1 by way of the grid 13. The position sensing means and the display field together constitute a data tablet. Such a data tablet is described, for example in an article by E.L. Walker entitled Unified read write panel , published in IBM TDB Vol. 23, No. 1, June 80, pages 278 281. The remote control system also comprises a transmission device 14 for the transmissions of instructions for the apparatus to be controlled. The transmission device comprises, for example a known infrared or ultrasonic transmitter which transmits, for each apparatus to be controlled, using a carrier have having a carrier frequency which is characteristic of the relevant apparatus. On the display field of the control member keys soft keys or controls are displayed with or without a designation, such a key or control is operated by touching the data tablet at the area where the relevant key or control is displayed. Touching is done either by means of a stylus or in that the user indicates the relevant position by a finger, for example as described in U.S. Patent SpecificationNo. 4,293,734. The remote control system in accordance with the invention is suitable for the remote control of a plurality of apparatus which are preferably apparatus for private consumes. When a user wishes to control an apparatus which is suitable for remote control by means of a remote control in accordance with the invention, a first menu of the various apparatus to be controlled by the remote control is displayed on the display field of the remote control at the beginning of the control operation. Figure 2 shots an example of such a first menu which comprises a first set of control keys for the selection of one of the apparatus. The various squares in Figure 2 represent the keys for the various apparatus to be remote controlled. For example, there is a key for the television receiver T.V. , a key for the radio receiver T and a key for the video tape recorder VR . The user selects the apparatus tc be controlled from the first menu to this end, he touches the kQv associated with the selected apparatus. After the touching of this key, the first menu is erased on the display field, and subsequently a second menu is displayed this second menu comprising a group of control keys with the various control possibilities of the apparatus selected by the user. Figure 3 shows an example of such a second menu the selected apparatus being a television receiver. The triangles in Figure 3 represent controls with a plurality of positions or continuous control, for example controls for tone, volwne, contrast and brightness. The key tm is intended, for example far teletext, the key for t igit channel numbers, the key R for a preset position, the key S for stereo, the key formed by two consecutive triangles for the balance between the left and the right speaker, and the bar with digits for the selection of the various stations.For each apparatus to be controlled there is such a group of control keys, all groups forming the elements of a second set of control keys. The key 10 is a reset key which is intended to erase the information displayed on the display field of the control member, after which the first menu is presented again. For the further description, a distinction will be made between a remote control system of the first type which acts only as a transmission device a remote control system of the second type which acts as a transmission device as well as a receiving device. Figure 4 shows an example of an embodiment of a remote control system of the first type. A remote control system of the first type comprises a control device 29 and a control member 19, both of which are connected to a bus 26. The bus 26 is intended for the communication of signals data addresses instructions between the control member, the control device and the transmission device 25 which is connected to the bus. The control unit 29 comprises a data processor unit 20, for example a microprocessor, a first memory 21, for example a r4 for the storage of information to be displayed and of data necessary for the operation of the remote control, and a second memory 22, for example a RAM which acts as the processing memory for the data processor unit.The data processor unit, the first memory and the second memory are connected to the bus 26. The control member 19 comprises the display field 24 with the sensitive layer not shown and also the control device 23 which comprises the display field control means and a control circuit of the position sensing means. The elements 23 and 24 together form the data tablet. The transmission device 25 serves for the transmission of the information indicated via the data tablet. The transmitter is preferably formed by an infrared transmitter in view of the high information density which can then be achieved. Other types such as, for example an ultrasonic transmitter are also feasible.When the position sensing means comprise a stylus 28, an analog todigital converter 27 is connected to the bus 26, said converter being connected to the stylus 25 The operation of the remote control system of the first type as shown in Figure 4 will now be described in detail with reference to the flowshart shown in Figure 5. When a user wishes to control an apparatus which is suitable for remote control by utilizing a control member in accordance with the invention, he will first activate the control member 30 .This is done, for example by using a reset key 10 which forms part of this control member or by taking the control member into the hand touch contacts accommodated in the housing of the control member . Due to the activation of the remote control system, any information displayed on the display field is erased 31 .Subsequentley, under the control of the data processor unit a first control signal is generated so that the program pointer 32 is set to a first address of the first memory memory 21, Figure 4 . At that first address an instruction is written for the display of a first menu which comprises the first set of control keys, that is to say a list of apparatus to be controlled by the remote control. This list forms part of the information stored in the first memory. Subsequently 33 , under the control of the data processor unit the first menu Figure 2 is displayed on the display field of the control member. The user can then select the apparatus to be controlled from the first menu displayed.During the time required by the user to make a selection, the data processor unit remains in a waiting situation 34 . As soon as the user indicates the selected apparatus in the first menu the position sensing means determine 35 the location where the display field is touched. This operation is performed in a customary manner for an SCD data tablet, that is to say by determination of the relevant position coordinates and by storing these coordinates in the second memory 22, Figure 4 . On the basis of these position coordinates, the data processor unit recognizes 36 the apparatus selected by the user.In order to do so, the data processor unit checks in which area of the display field said position coordinates are situated and also check which apparatus is displayed within the relevant area. After the data processor unit has recognized the apparatus selected by the user, it determines a second address for the selected apparatus 37 . The second address is determined, for example by utilizing the position coordinates determined in step 35 which then act as a second address for the first memory 21, Figure 4 .Subsequently, under the control of the data processor unit a second control signal is generated, with the result that the program pointer is set to said second address 38 . The second address contains an instruction for the display of a second menu which comprises a group of control keys of the apparatus selected by the user. The latter group also forms part of the information stored in the first memory.Subsequently, under the control of the data processor unit the information present on the display field is erased 39 and the instruction stored at the second address is read. After completion of these operations, the data processor unit executes 40 the instruction stored at the second address, so that the control keys of the apparatus selected by the user are displayed on the display field of the control member. Subsequently1 the data processor awaits 41 instructions from the user. As soon as the user has formulated these instructions touching of the display field , the position sensing means again determine 42 the coordinates of the location where the display field is touched. Subsequently, the data processor unit recognizes 43 the control key indicated by the user.This recognition is performed in the same way as described for step 36. When the data processor unit has recognized the control key selected by the user, it determines a third address 44 for the selected control key, said third address being stored in the second memory. This third address is determined, for example on the basis of an operation executed on the coordinates determined during step 42. Subsequently, under the control of the data processor unit a third control signal is generated with the result that the program pointer is set to said third address 45 . The third address contains an instruction for the execution of the function of the control key selected by the user. Such a function is, for example the switching over to another station the third address then contains an instruction for controlling the switching over to the station selected by the user. Under the control of the data processor unit, this instruction is read and executed 46 , the transmitter 25 being activated so as to transmit the instruction to the selected apparatus. The data processor unit then checks 47 whether the selected control key is a control key with continuous control, for example a volume control, or a control key having a switching function, for example a switch for the switching on and off of a noise filter in an audio amplifier. This check is performed, for example on the basis of said third address, either on the basis of all address bits or on the basis of a few address bits of said third address.When the control key selected by the user is a control key having a switching function S , the data processor unit subsequently checks 48 whether the selected control key requires a special operation as regards the display on the display field of the control mEmber for example, when the noise filter switch of the audio amplifier was switched on, an indication is given on the display field in the form of an asterisk or a rectangle around the key this is performed in step 49. However, if no special information is to be displayed N in step 48 , the program proceeds to step 50 under the control of the data processor unit. When the control key selected by the user is a key with continuous control c , step 49 is reached under the control of the data processor unit.The new position of the control key with continuous control is then displayed on the display field of the control member. Positions of a control key with continuous as shown in Figure 3 triangles are displayed, for example, by inserting a numker of equidistant strokes in the triangle and by indicating the relevant position by making the stroke in the relevant position heavier.The advantage thereof is that the user can see on the control member which position of the continuous control has been adjusted. The use of strokes also offers the advantage that a simple coupling to the data processor unit is thus obtained. This is because each stroke thus represents a coordinate and the changing of a position is then actually no more than the determination of other coordinates, be it in an absolute or a relative manner with respect to the coordinates of the previous position which are stored in the second memory step 44 .After completion of step 49, the data processor unit a aits 50 further instructions from the user. These instructions may be either the modification T of the setting of the apparatus selected in step 34, in which case a jump is made to step 42, or the selection of another apparatus to be controlled by operating the reset key, in which case R a jump is made to step 30. The display as described with reference to step 49 and the preceding operations will now be described in detail with reference to Figure 6 which shews the principal elements of the control device 23 of Figure 4. The control device 23 is connected to the bus 26 whereto also the data processor unit, the first and the second memory are connected. The control device 23 is also connected to the display field 24. Information to be displayed on the display field is fetched, under the control of the data processor unit, from the first or the second memory in the form of a data word or words and presented to the display field control means 53 via the bus 26.The data word is displayed on the display field 24 by way of the display field control means The data processor unit memorizes the content and the location of the information displayed on the display field, for example by storing a copy of this information in the second memory. When a user indicates information displayed on the display field, the x y coordinates of the location where the indicated information is displayed are determined by means of the sensitive layer 13 and the control circuit 52 of the position sensing means. A control circuit 52 of this type is described, for example in U.S. Patent Specification No. 4.293,734. This control circuit supplies an analog coordinate signal which is converted into a digital coordinate signal by means of an analog to digital converter 51. The digital coordinate signal is stored in the second memory via the bus 26 and under the control of the data processor unit.By comparison of this digital coordinate signal with the content and the location of the information displayed on the display field and stored in the second memory, the data processor unit determines which information in this case an apparatus to be controlled or a control key of a selected apparatus is indicated by the user When the indicated information concerns a position of a control key with continuous control determined in step 47 of Figure 6 , an information word representing the modified position is generated under the control of the data processor unit, said word being subsequently displayed on the display field. The content of this irlformation word is composed, for example on the basis of said digital coordinate signal. Alternatively, the second menu is subdivided into various submenus. For example, when out of the first menu a cassette deck was selected as the apparatus to be controlled, it may be that the second menu comprises a control key tape select . The indication of this control key tape select results in the display on the display field of a submenu of the various types of recording tape Fe, Cur02, metal , so that the user can select the type of tape associated with the cassette used. The display of such a submenu is analogous to the display of a second menu. Sub irnus can be used mainly for control keys where the adjusted position is only rarely changed. A remote control system of the second type transmission and receiving device will be described in detail hereinafter. Two classes can be distin uished in this type of remote control a a first class where the remote control device does not have local intelligence b a second class where the remote control device does have local intelligence. Figure 7 shows an embodiment of a control member of the first class. Such a control member of the first class comprises a transii,i sion receiving element 64, for example an infrafred transmission receiving element. The transmission receiving element is connected to a digital to analog converter 61 and to an analog to digital converter 63.The digital to analog converter 61 translates the digital information received into analog information for presentation to the display field control means 60 which in its turn ensures that the data received is displayed on the display field 24. This control member also comprises a sensitive layer 13 as described for a remote control of the first type. This sensitive layer is connected to a control circuit 62 of the position sensing means which is connected to the analog to digital converter 63. A control member as shown in Figure 7 is controlled by a control device which communicates with the control member via the transmission receiving device 64.The control device comprises an interface for all apparatus to be controlled by means of the control member. In the embodiment shown inFigure 8, all apparatus to be controlled are connected to a D2B bus domestIc digital bus . Such a DIB bus is described, for example in the article buses organize the electronic home , published inElectronics, September 22, 1981 PHN 9737 . In Figure 8 several apparatus are connected to the D2B bus 70 external bus , for example a video tape recorder VR , an audio tape recorder REC , a radio receiver TNR , a microwave oven MOV , a television receiver TV , a display monitor A and the control device 71 which comprises a transmissIon receiving device which exchanges information with the control member as shown in Figure 7. Figure 9 shows an embodiment of such a control device 71.The control device 71 comprises an internal bus 76 whereto a data processor unit 72, a first memory 73 for example, a i , and a second memory 74 for example, a RAtl are connected. Also connected to the internal bus is a transmission receiving device 75. The operation of the control member shown in Figure 7 and the control device shorn in Figure 9 will be described on the basis of the flo. hart of Figure 10 which is referred to hereinafter as the display subroutine. It is assumEt that a user activates the remote control system as shown in Figure 7 for example, by means of the reset key 10 .The transmission receiving device 64 of the control member transmits a start signal to the control device 71 where it is received by the transmission receiving device 75. After reception of the start signal by the transmission receiving device 75, it is presented to the data processor unit 72 which in its turn starts the display subroutine 80 . The data processor unit now checks which apparatus are connected to the D2B bus. This check is performed by the data processor unit, for example by transmitting a presence signal 81 to a first one of the plurality of apparatus connected to the D2B bus and by waiting 82 for a response from the said first apparatus. Then the first apparatus is present, i.e. connected to the D2B bus and in the operative condition, it despatches a presence information Y to the data processor unit which memorizes this fact 83 , for example by setting a flag for the relevant first apparatus in the second memory 74. When the presence informaticn of the first apparatus has been memorized or when the first apparatus has not returned presence information to the data processor within a predetermined period of time N in which case the flag is not set , the data processor selects 84 a second apparatus from the plurality of apparatus connected to theD2B bus.This is achieved, for example, in that this plurality of apparatus connected to the D 2 bus is stored in the first memory, and in that the data processor unit successively addresses this plurality.Subsequently, the data processor unit checks 85 whether a presence signal has been applied to each apparatus of said plurality. If each apparatus has not yet had its turn N , a presence signal is applied to the second apparatus 81 and the steps 82, 83, 84 and 85 are repeated. However, if each apparatus has had its turn Y , under the control of the data processor unit a first menu is assembled 86 of apparatus which are connected to the D bus and which have signalled their presence. The first menu comprises a first set of control keys of the select ion of an apparatus from the apparatus present.Subsequently, under the control of a first signal generated by the data processor unit, said first menu is applied, via the transmission receiving device 75, to the control member 87 in order to be received by the transmission receiving device 64 therein. The first menu received is then displayed on the display field 24 by means of the display field control me .s 60 the user can then select the apparatus to be controlled. Tne data processor unit waits 88 until it receives the selection from the user. The user s selection is applied to the control device via the transmission receiving device 64 .Subsequently, the data processor unit checks 89 for example, on the basis of the coordinates of the indicated position as described for a remote control of the first type which apparatus has been selected by the user. Subse iently, the data processor unit extracts 90 the control possibilities for the selected apparatus for example by reading a local memory of the selected apparatus and composes 91 a second renu on the basis thereof. The second menu comprises a group of control keys for the control of the selected apparatus. Subsequently, the second choice is applied, using the transmission receiving device 75, to the control member 92 and tha data processor unit again awaits 93 the selection by the user.After the user has determined his selection, the data processor unit checks 94 which control key has been selected and subsequently executes 95 the desired operation. Analogous to a remote control of the first type, the data processor unit checks 96 whether the selected control key is a control key with continuous control or a control key with a switching function. When the selected control key is a key with continuous control C , the data processor unit picks up 98 the new position of this control key and displays It 99 on the display field on the control me . This offers the advantage that the user can nag check whether his instruction has been correctly executed. When the selected control key is a key having a switching function S , the data processor unit checks 97 analogous to step 48 of Figure 5 whether additional information is to be displayed for the selected control key. If this is the case Y , this information is displayed 99 . If n information is to be displayed 98 N or after a display step 99, the data processor unit waits until a net instruction has been formulated by the user. This instruction iray be a modification T of the setting of the apparatus selected in step 88, in which case a jump is made to step 94, or the selection of another apparatus to be controlled by control of the reset key, in sshich case R a jump is made to step 80. Hereinafter a remote control system of the second tynet second class will be described comJrising local intelligence . This remote control system of the second class differs from that of the first class in that the control unit and the control member are connected to a common bus. Their operation is analogous to those of the first class. It will be apparent that the invention is not restricted to the embodiments given in the description. The invention also relates to any modification of these embodiments in which different elements of these embodiments are combined.
