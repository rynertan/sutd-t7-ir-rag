# Variable valve timing mechanism for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine having at least one cylin der 82 with inlet and exhaust 88 valves operated via rocker arms 85 by respective cams 89, 90 carried by a single camshaft 84 . The camshaft is connected to its drive 83 by an eccentric linkage 91 , the eccentricity of which is varied by a device 92 responsive to engine speed, and is least at high speed. As engine speed falls, increasing eccentricity results in a relative advance of inlet valve closing time and relative retardation of exhaust and inlet valve opening times but little change in the timing of exhaust valve closure. The lift of the valves may be varied also if the rocker arm axes 93 are movably mounted.
