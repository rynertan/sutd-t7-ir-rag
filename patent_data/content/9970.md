# High intensity discharge sodium lamps.

## Abstract
High intensity discharge HID sodium lamps having a starting aid comprising a plug like ceramic member 36 extending through the longitudinal wall of the arc tube proxi mate one of the lamp electrodes 16. The plug like ceramic member is fused to the alumina arc tube 12 and is electrically conductive by virtue of having embedded therein a small percentage of finely divided refractory metal. At least during lamp starting, the plug like ceramic starting aid is electrically connected through a resistor 44 to the opposite lamp elec trode and, as a result, on application of energizing potential, a glow discharge is established between the interior surface of the plug like ceramic member and the proximate lamp elec trode to ionize the atmosphere within the arc tube to facilitate lamp starting.
