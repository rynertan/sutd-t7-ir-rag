## Description
COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compositions comprising blends of polymer resins. Mcre particularly it relates to blends of aromatic polycarbonate resins and graft derivatives of ethylene propylene terpolymers. The aromatic polycarbonate resins are a well known family of materials which are polymeric esters of carbonic acid. The polycarbonate materials are thermoplastic materials characterizect by excellent strength, and temperature resistance. This maces them useful for making molded and shaped articles. Polycarbonate resins have been used alone or in blends with other thermoplastic polymers such as high molecular weight polymeric glycol esters of terephthalic and or isophthalic acid. Polycarbonates have also been used in combination with styrene acrylonitrile but adiene terpctlyoers, the so called ABS resins, at least several of which are commercially available e.g. CYCOtAC Borg Warner Chemicals, Inc. . Mixtures of polycarbonates with ABS graft copolymers are disclosed to have improved impact properties in U.S. Patent No. 4,172,10 ,. However, it is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,130,177 and 3,852,393 that impact resistance of polycarbonate tends to be lowered when it is blended with ABS resins. Graf ted derivatives of ethylene propylene diene terpolymers and compositions of such polymers with other resins are known in the art and described in the patent literature. Several of them are commercially available e.g., ROVEL Uniroyal, Inc. . It has been disclosed, for instance, that olefinic copolymers and terpolymers can be grafted with styrene, styreneacrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, styrene methyl methacrylate, and the like, to provide thermoplastics which can be further blended, e.g., with styreneacrylonitrile, and molded, extruded or vacuum formed into articles having good tensile and impact strengths.Polymers of this type and methods of their preparation are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,166,081 and U.S.Patent No. 4,202,948, the latter incorporated by reference. Thermoplastic resin blends of polysulfone resins and graft derivatives of ethylene propylene terpolymers are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,641,207 to have good processability and impact resistance over relatively narrow concentration ranges. It has now been discovered that aromatic polycarbonates and copolyestercarbonates can be blended with grafted derivatives of ethylene propylene diene terpolymers to obtain advantageous properties after molding. Surprisingly, such properties are obtained over a wide range of compositions. Especially noteworthy are high gloss on the surface of articles molded from the compositions and resistance to environmental stress cracking resistance. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention there are provided thermoplastic compositions suitable for extrusion, molding or shaping by other means into various articles, comprising an admixture of a an aromatic polycarbonate or polyestercarbonate resin, and b an ethylene propylene non conjugated diene interpolymer grafted with the homopolymer or copolymer of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers as disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 4,202,948, for example, styrene, styreneacrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate or styrene methyl methacrylate, halostyrenes, alpha methylstyrene, p methylstyrene acrylonitrile, methacrylontrile, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, the lower alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, styrene maleic anhydride and the like. The compositions are moldable into parts, pieces and articles which possess a very glossy surface.Mechanical properties such as impact strength are comparable to those of conventional aromatic polycarbonate blends. The compositions are able to tolerate the presence of stress cracking agents, such as gasoline, and or other additives which normally attack or otherwise have a harmful effect on polycarbonates. In comparison with certain prior art blends, resistance to deterioration by exposure to the elements is superior. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Preferred for use as component a in the compositions of this invention are high molecular weight aromatic polycarbonates of the formula EMI3.1 where R1 and R2 are, independently, hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl X1 and X2 are, independently lower alkyl, lower alkenyl or alkaryl p and r represent the total number of substituents on the rings and are, independently, integers from 1 to 4 and n represents the total number of monomer units in the polymer and is an integer of at least 30. The terms lower alkyl and lower alkenyl in this disclosure are intended to mean alkyl and alkenyl having from 1 to 10, preferably I to 6, carbon atoms, inclusive.Aryl is preferably phenyl. Encompassed within the scope of the invention are polycarbonate homopolymers and copolymers having molecular weight number average within the range between about 8,000 and 200,000, or higher, preferably between about 10,000 and 80,000, and an intrinsic viscosity of from about 0.3 to 1.0 deciliters per gram as measured in methylene chloride at 250C. The polycarbonate resins are preferably prepared from dihydric phenols, including 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane also termed bisphenol A , bis 4 hy droxyphenyl methane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methylphenyl propane, 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane, 2,2 3,5,3 , 5 tetrachloro 4,4 dihydroxypropane, 2,2 3,5,3 5 tetrabromo 4,4 dihydroxy diphenyl propane, and 3,3 dichloro 4, 4 dihydroxy diphenyl methane. Still other dihydric phenols which are also suitable are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,999,835 3,028,365 3,334,154 and 4,131,575. The aromatic polycarbonates can be prepared using known processes, such as, for example, by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor, e.g., phosgene, in accordance with the techniques set forth in the above cited patents and in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,018,750 and 4,123,436, or by transesterification processes such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No.3,153,008. Also suitable for use as component a are aromatic polyestercarbonates derived from a mixture of a dihydric phenol, a dicarboxylic acid or acid chloride and phosgene, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,169,121 and incorporated by reference as well as branched polycarbonates such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.4,001,184 and incorporated by reference. In addition to the foregoing types, component a can be comprised of a blend of two or more aromatic polycarbonates, including any of those which have been described. Component b is a resinous composition of i polymerized alkenyl aromatic units and or ii polymerized acrylic units, in combination with iii a rubbery terpolymer comprising copolymerized units of ethylene and propylene and a non conjugated diolef in. Component b preferably is a graft copolymer produced by poly merizing the resin forming alkenyl aromatic monomer ana the acrylic monomer in the presence of a rubbery terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and a non conjugated diolefin. The non conjugated dienes used in the preparation of the terpolymer elastomers may include open chain non conjugated dienes such as 1,4 hexadiene and also cyclic especially bridged ring non conjugated dienes such as dicyclopentadiene, 5 methylene 2 norbornene, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene and 1,4 cyclooctadiene. The respective weight ratios of ethylene to propylene in the elastomers may range from 40 60 to 75 25. The content of the additional monomer, such as the nonconjugated diene, in the terpolymer can range from about 1 to about 20 by weight. The preferred diene is 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene. Methods for the preparation of the foregoing rubbery terpolymers are described in U.S. Patent Nos.2,933,480 3,000,866 and 3,000,867. The resin forming monomers useful for copolymerization with the described rubbery copolymers and terpolymers include styrene, g methylstyrene, p methylstyrene and other alkyl ring substituted styrenes and acrylics such as acrylonitrile, acrylates and alkacrylates. The ester portion of the acrylate is generally alkyl from one to about eight carbon atoms, inclusive, preferably one to about six carbon atoms, inclusive.The walks portion of the alkacrylate is alkyl of one to three carbon atoms, inclusive. Examples of acrylate and alkacrylate include ethylacrylate, n butyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexylacrylate, methylmethacrylate, propylethacrylate and isopentylpropacrylate. Mixtures of styrenics and acrylates can also be employed. Especially preferred are mixtures of styrene and acrylonitrile. As explained above, the graft copolymers are prepared by polymerizing the resin forming monomers, e.g., styrene and acrylonitrile, in the presence of rubbery terpolymer, e.g., ethylene propylene diene. In one procedure, the rubbery terpolymer is dissolved in an inert organic solvent, e.g., benzene, to form a cement, to which is added the desired amount of resin forming monomers and a radical initiator, e.g., peroxide. The mixture is heated to decompose the initiator and to polymerize the monomers. The graft copolymer which results is isolated, e.g., by precipitation with an anti solvent such as methanol. The evidence indicates that at least a portion of the resin grafts onto the rubber to form a graft copolymer made up of a rubbery spine or backbone polymer and resinous side chains. The proportion of resin forming monomers to rubber used in the graft polymerization can vary, for instance, from 1 4 to 4 1, on a weight basis. The graft copolymers and method of their preparation are described in greater detail by F.X. O Shea inU.S. Patent No. 3,642,950, and by Albert Fournier, Jr.and Charles Paddock in U.S. Patent No. 4,166,081.Suitable materials are also available commercially fromUniroyal, Inc., Naugatuck, Connecticut under the trade designation ROVES resins. Components a and b are compatible in widely variant proportions, for example, from 5 to 95 parts by weight of a and from 95 to 5 parts by weight of b , per 100 parts by we ight of a and b combined with the particular amount being dependent on specific require ments. A preferred ratio is from about 60 to about 95 parts by weight a and about 5 to 40 parts by weight b. The compositions can also include one or more other ingredients, such as supplementary non resinous additives conventionally employed with aromatic polycarbonate resins and blends of such resins. Examples include mineral fillers, e.g., clay, talc, mica, etc., reinforcing agents, e.g., fibrous or flaked glass, graphite whiskers, aluminum shavings, wollastonite, titanate whiskers, carbon filaments, etc. pigments dyes processing aids stabilizers antioxidants flame retardants and so forth. These materials can be added in conventional amounts, e.g., from 1 to 50 by weight of the total composition. Preparation of the compositions may be accomplished by tumble blending components a , b , and any other ingredients, extruding the blend and then injection molding the extrudate. The mode of preparation is not essential, however, and other well known procedures for preparing molded polycarbonates can be utilized.
