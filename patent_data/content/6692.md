# Streptomyces plasmids and microorganisms containing them, their use as vectors for nucleic acid and a process for the incorporation of nucleic acids into cellular systems.

## Abstract
Novel Streptomyces plasmids have the characteristic that their presence in the non integrated form in a micro organism of the species Streptomyces lividans confers on that micro organism the properties a of forming pocks when grown on a lawn of that strain of micro organism deposited with the Deutsche Samlung von Mikro organis men DSM under the reference number 1567, and b of not forming pocks when grown on a lawn of that strain of micro organism deposited with the DSM under the reference number 1568, or which is derivable from a plas mid having such a characteristic by the removal or addi tion of DNA therefrom. The plasmids are prepared from micro organism con taining them or by the manipulation of other plasmids of the group and are of value as vectors for the introduction of nucleic acid into micro organisms.
