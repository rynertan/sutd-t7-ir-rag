# Process for preparing biopterin and its derivatives.

## Abstract
A novel compound, 1 ,2 diacyl 6R,S 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro L biopterin which is prepared by catalytical hyd rogenation of a 1 ,2 diacyl L biopterin in a solvent in the presence of a catalyst. The 1 ,2 diacyl L biopterin is pre pared from a 1,1 dialkylsulfonyl L rhamnose through an acyl derivative of 5 deoxy L arabinose and a hydrazine derivative of tetrahydro L biopterin without isolating the intermediate products. The 1 ,2 diacyl 6R,S 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro L biopterin can be used for treatment of atypical phenylketo nuria or dihydropterin reductase deficiency and can readily cross the blood brain barrier without neurotransmitter precursors.
