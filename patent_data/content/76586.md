# A cascade monitoring apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for monitoring the value of one or more physical parameters, the apparatus including a plurality of physical monitoring modules, master electronics, and struc ture for interconnecting each of the modules and the master electronics. Each module includes a logic section and a transducer section. The logic section receives a logic signal and responds by activating the transducer. The logic signal is passed to the next module according to a clock pulse which is generated from the master electronics. The transducer senses a physical parameter. When activated, the transducer responds to the physical parameter with an electrical signal and communicates the electrical signal to the master electro nics which utilizes the electrical signal for monitoring purposes.
