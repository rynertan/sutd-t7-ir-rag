# Preparation of hydrocarbon soluble transition metal salts of organic carboxylic acids.

## Abstract
A process for preparing hydrocarbon soluble transition metal salts of organic carboxylic acids having improved properties wherein the transition metal is one capable of having a multiplicity of oxidation states is described. The process comprises the steps of a providing at least one transition metal compound wherein the transition metal is at one of its higher positive oxidation states, b treating said transition metal compound with at least one inorganic reducing agent forming an intermediate containing the transition metal in a lower positive oxidation state, and c reacting said intermediate with at least one organic carboxy lic acid containing at least 5 carbon atoms to form the transition metal salt of said carboxylic acid. The transition metal salts prepared in accordance with the process of the invention are useful in a variety of applications including resins, inks, paints, lubricants and fuels.
