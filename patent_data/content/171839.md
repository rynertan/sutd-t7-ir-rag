# Colour television receiver comprising a chrominance signal processing circuit and an integrated circuit therefor.

## Abstract
By including a counting circuit 161 , optionally followed by a sample and hold circuit 155 , coupled to an output 41 of a quadrature component demodulator 37 in a chromi nance signal processing section of a colour television receiver and providing a memory circuit 135 for a preset ting value, which memory circuit is coupled to a control signal input 67 of a chrominance carrier oscillator 65 via a digital to analog converter 141 a fast, sufficiently accurate automatic adjusting procedure for this oscillator 65 can be obtained, while a normally provided control loop 63, 59, 57, 79, 77, 75, 73, 71, 69, 67 of the oscillator 65 is made inoperative 105 .
