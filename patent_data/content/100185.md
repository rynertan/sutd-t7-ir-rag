## Abstract
Attachment means for holding a creased printing plate comprises a shim or saddle member having an undercut leading end face adapted to clamp the leading end of the printing plate. A curved peripheral surface supports the central region of the plate. At the junction of said end face and said peripheral surface a recess secures a projecting crease rib of said creased plate.
