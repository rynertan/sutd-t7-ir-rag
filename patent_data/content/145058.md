# ELECTRICAL VIBRATOR COMPRESSION DEVICE

## Abstract
An electrical vibrator compression device comprising a coil and a magnet movable with respect to each other, one of these two components being coupled to a piston like body which is movable in a cylinder. The second component, which is not coupled to the piston like body, is connected by means of springs to a housing to which the cylinder is connected. When the device is in operation, vibrations will be suppressed in a manner such that the cylinder housing substantially does not vibrate.
