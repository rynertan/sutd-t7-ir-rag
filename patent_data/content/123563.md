# CONVERTING DIGITAL SIGNALS

## Abstract
A converted digital signal is provided in NRZI code with a dc component of zero and with a maximum number of four bits between level transitions in the signal. The base digital signal is divided into 8 bit base words, each of which is then converted into a 10 bit converted word to form a converted digital signal suitable for recording. Of the 1024 2¹⁰ possible 10 bit combinations, there are 193 that begin with no more than two digital zeros, end with no more than one digital zero, have no more than three consecutive digital zeros anywhere else and have a dc component of zero when NRZI coded. Each of these 193 primary 10 bit combinations is used to represent one 8 bit base word. Each remaining 63 of the total 256 2⁸ base words is converted into a secondary 10 bit combination which has a convention dc component of 2 or 2, defined as the dc component when the combination is NRZI coded and the preceding combination ends at the signal s lower level, but which otherwise meets the description of the 193 primary 10 bit combinations. Beginning with the first bit of one secondary combination, the number of level transitions in the converted digital signal, when NRZI coded, are detected up to the end of the 10 bit combination immediately preceding the next secon dary combination. Depending on the number of level changes, the first bit of the next secondary combination is provided to give that secondary combination a convention dc component which eliminates the actual dc component in the portion of the signal containing the pair of secondary combinations.
