## Description
Photoelectric smoke detector equipped with smoke detecting function test means.It has been known that the operating test of the smoke detector which detects presence of smoke by scattering of light caused by entry of smoke into the light from the light emitting element and falling onto the light receiving element is carried out by increasing, from the control panel, the output of the light emitting element to increase the output of the light receiving element with the noise light scattered in all directions on the wall surfaces in the labyrinth.Nevertheless, none of the photoelectric smoke detectors of this kind has ever had such a provision for checking, by remote operation from the control panel, the important function the detector, i.e. whether the output of the light receiving element of the detector is within the normal level range which causes no false alarm, alarm failure nor delayed alarm.The purpose of this invention is to obtain a photoelectric smoke detector equipped with a smoke detecting function test means which, upon receipt of a signal sent from a control panel through lines connecting the smoke detector with the control panel, is capable of automatically, readily and precisely checking whether the output of the light receiving element in the smoke detector is within the normal level range, and of reporting to the control panel on the result of the check through the same lines.

With the output of the AND gate As transmitted through a diode D3 and a resistor r16, the transistor T2 becomes conductive and shorts the resistor r4 alone. Thus, the voltage applied as operating level to the terminal on the input of the comparatorCM in the comparison part 3 becomes the fire level of the light scattering type smoke detector while the both transistors T1, T2 are not conducting.As the transistor T1 become conductive, the voltage becomes the lower limit of the normal level range as a threshold level of the detector at which alarm failure or delayed alarm is likely to occur.

Shown in Figure 2 are a d.c. power supply E a detecting circuit M for abnormal signal with frequency f2 including a fire signal a detecting circuit N for normal signal with frequency fl a relayX which operates when a test start switch SW1 has closed a relayY which operates when a reset switch SW2 has closed a test start signal generator TS which operates when the contact xl of the relayX has closed a reset signal generator RS which operates when the contact y1 of the relay Y has closed a fire indicator lamp Lal which is lit through the break contact X4 of the relay X and the make contact m1 of the relay N an abnormal indicator lamp La2 which is lit through the make contact x3 of the relay X and the make contact m2 of the relay M a normal indicator lamp Las which is lit through the make contact x3 of the relay X and the make contact n1 of the relay N a timer T which starts operating when the contact x5 of the relay X has closed, and a trouble indicator lamp La4 which is operated through the make contact t of the timer T and the break contacts m3, n2 of the relays M, N to indicate accidents such as trouble in the detector lines or interruption of the lines li, 12.Firstly, operation of ea.l part of this exr.bosiment during the normal supervisor conjition and in case of fire is described with reference to the time charts shown in Figure 3 A . Shown in Figure 3 A are smoke density 1 , voltage 2 on the lines 11, 12. During the normal supervisory condition without smoke, the voltage on the lines li, 12 is Ehown in the left part of Figure 1 while the voltage on the output line d of the signal receiving circuit 7 is at L level as shown at the left part pf Figure 3 because the transistor T4 is conducting. Consequently, in the reset signal generating circuit 8, the output of the NOT gate N1 becomes H level. With this output the capacitor C3 is charged, and the output of the NOT gate N2 becomesL level, thus no reset signal is generated as shown at the left part of Figure 4 . In the timer circuit 9, the latch Lt2 formed by theNOR gates NRs, NR4 has the input of L level, and accordingly its output, too, is at L level as shown in the left part of Figure 5 , thus no clock signal is generated As shown in Figures 6 , 7 the Q outputs ol the monostable multivibrators MM1, MM2 are at L level, the 9 output of the former MM1 ts at H level, and the outputs of the AND gates A2, A3 are at L level.Therefore, the transistors T1, T2 in the operating level changeover circuit 10 do not switch on, and as shown with the dotted line in figure 11 the operating level of the comparatorCM in the comparison part 3 is at fire level Ls which is determined by dividing ratio of the resistance values of the resistors rl are r2 r3 r4. The light emitting element LE emits light through the driving circuit PD in the light emitting part 1 each time the pulse oscillatorP01 generates the synchronizing signal as shown in Figure 10 .With the scattered light from the inner wall of the labyrinth the output amplifier AM of the light receiving element SB in the light receiving part 2 gives off an output as shown in Figure 11 . Nevertheless, since this output is below the fire level L5 under the condition without smoke, the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 has no output as shown in the left part of Figure 12 . In the fire discriminating part 4. the output of the NOT gate N3 is at H level because the Q output of the monostable multivibrator MM2 in the timer circuit 9 isat L level.However, since the output of the comparator CM is at L level, the output of the AND gate A1 becomes L level, and accordingly the input of the latch Ltl formed by NOR gates NR1, NR2 and the output of the NOR gate NR2 are at L lextel as shown in the left part of Figure 13 . In the smoke detecting function discriminatlng circuit 11 the output of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 being atL level, the outputs of the AND gates A4, A5 are at L level. Accordingly the output of the OR gate R1 is at L level and the Q output of the R S flip flop circuit FF1 is at L level as shown in Figure 14 .TheQ output of the monostable multivibrator MM2 in the time circuit 9 is at L level while the output of the NOT gate N4 is at H level.Accordingly, the outputs of the NOR gate NRs serving as clock signal generator, the Q output of the Dtype flip flop circuit FF2 and the output of the latch LtS formed by NOR gate NR6, NR, are at L level as shown in Figure 16 , 15 and 17 respectively. Therefore, in the signal generating circuit 5 the pulse oscillator PO2 produces pulses with frequencies fl and f2 shown in Figure 18 and 19 respectively. With the pulse having frequency fl and the Q output of the circuit TF2 being at z level, the output of the NAND gate NA1 becomes continuous H level.With the pulse signal having frequency f2 and the continued H level output of the HAND gate NA1, the NAND gate NA2 generates a pulse signal with a phase opposite to that of the pulse signal having frequency f2 from the pulse oscillator PO2 as shown in Figure 20 . Since the output of the NOR gate NRa in the signal transmission circuit 6 is at H level, the output of the NOR gate NR, is at L level as shown in the left part of Figure 21 , consequently the transistor T3 does not become conductive, and no output appears on the lines 11, 12 as shown in the left part of Figure 2 .When smoke generated by fire enters the labyrinth and its density exceeds the fire level L3 as shown in the middle part of Figure I , the amplifier AM for the light receiving element SB generates a pulse signals exceeding the fire level L3 as shown in Figure it , and the comparator CM generates a corresponding pulse signal as shown in Figure 12 at the time of light emission from the light emitting element LE.With this pulse signal, the synchronizing signal generated by oscillatorPO1 as shown in Figure 10 and the H level output of the NOT gateN3, the AND gate A1 generates a pulse signal corresponding to the output of the comparator CM. This pulse signal sets the output of the latch Ltl formed by NOR gates NR1, NR2 as shown in Figure 13 , and theNOR gate NR2 generates a fire detecting output. With the fire detecting output fiur.. the NOR gate , the output of the NOR gate NR6 in the signal transmission circuit 6 becomes L level.With this L level output and the pulse signal of frequency f2 from the NAND gate N2 in the signal generating circuit 5 as shown in Figure 20 , the NOR gate NRg generates a pulse signal with frequency f2 as shown in Figure 21 and sends an abnormal signal with frequency f2 as fire signal as shown in Figure 2 to the lines 11, 12 through the transistor T5 As the abnormal signal detecting circuit M in the control panel shown in Figure 2 detects the fire signal, the contact m1 closes and the fire indicator lamp Lal lights. In order to reset the alarming detector the reset switch SW2 on the control panel is closed to operate the relay Y.Then, the contact yl closes to operate the reset signal generator RS, which sends out the reset signal as shown with the symbolP2 in Figure 2 to the lines li, 12. With the signal P2 the transistorTo in the signal receiving circuit 7 in the detector stops conducting, and the signal P2 as shown in Figure 3 3 is generated in the output line d in the circuit, As a result of this, the output of theNOT gate N1 in the reset signal generating circuit 8 becomes t level, and the charge on the capacitor C3 is released through the NOT gateN1. When the input of the NOT gate N2 becomes L level, the NOT gate N2 generates the clear signal c as shown in Figure 4 .On the other hand, if the output P2 of the circuit 7 is received by the input terminal of the latch Lt2 formed by NOR gates NR,, NR4 in the timer circuit 9 before the NOT gate N2 generates the clear signal, the latch Lt2 is set and the NOR gate NR4 gives an output at H level as shown in Figure 5 . With the output of the NOR gate NR4 the capacitor Co is charged as shown with the dotted line in Figure 5 through the resistor rl3. Since the circuit 8 generates the clear signal c as shown in Figure 4 before the capacitor voltage reaches such a level as may be judged as a clock signal, the setting of the latch Lt2 is cleared by this signal c and the charge on the capacitor C is released through the resistor rl4, thus no clock signal is generated.When resetting the detector in the above manner, if the smokeltdensity is below the fire level L5 as shown in Figure 1 , setting of the latch Ltl formed by NOR gates NR1, NE2 is cleared by the clear signal c shown in Figure 4 , and the fire detecting output of the NOR gate NR2 stops as shon in Figure 13 . Then the output of the NOR gate N in the signal transmissicn circuit 6 becomes H level, and the output of the NOR gate NRg stops, thus no fire signal is sent to the lines 11, L2.Consequently, the abnormal signal detecting circuit M in the control panel shown in Figure 2 no longer detects the fire signal, thus the contact m1 opens, and the fire indicator lamp Lal extinguishes. Operation of each part at the time of testing while the output of the amplifier AM in the light receiving part 2 is within the normal level range is described below with reference to the time chart shown in Figure 4 A .As the test start switch SW, in the control panel shown in Figure 2 is closed, the relay X operates and the contacts xl x3 close.The test start signal generator TS sends the test start signal shown with a symbol P1 in Figure 4A 2 to the lines 11, 12 to interrupt, for a short time, conduction of the transistor T4 in the signal receiving circuit 7 of the detector shown in Figure 1. The circuit 7 generates the pulse signal P1 in the output line d as shown in Figure 33 With the signal P1 , the output of the NOT gate N1 in the reset signal generating circuit 8 becomes L level, and the charge on the capacitor C, is released through the NOT gate N1. Nevertheless, before the voltage of the capacitor C5 raises the output of the NOT gate N2 to H level, the output P1 disappears and the output of the NOT gate N1 again becomes H level.Therefore, the capacitor C3 is recharged, thus the NOT gate N2 maintains the L level output as shown in Figure 4 . The output P1, of the circuit 7 also sets the latch Lt2 formed by NOR gates NRs, NR4 in the timer circuit 9. As the capacitor Cq is charged with the H level output of the NOR gate NR through the resistor r15 as shown with the dotted line in Figure 5 and its voltage reaches the H level, the clock signal is sent to theCP terminals of the monostable multivibrators MM1, MM2 with this voltage.At the Q terminals of the monostable multivibrators MM1, MM2, H level outputs develop as shown in Figures 6 , 7 , and aL level output develops on the Q terminal of the monostable multivibrator EM1, then the output of the AND gate A2 becomes H level as shown in Figure 8 . The transistor T1 in the operating level changeover circuit 10 too is conducting while the output of the AND gate A2 is at H level.Thus, the operating level of the comparator CM in the c mparii1 prt 3 becomes the lower left L1 of the normal level range which is determined by resistance dividing ratio of the resistor r1, r2, as shown with the dotted line in Figure 11 . Furthermore, since the Q output of the monostable multivibrator MM2 is at H level, the output of the NOT gate N5 becomes L level and inhibits operation of the AND gate A1. On the other hand the capacitor C5 in the function discriminating circuit 11 is charged.When its voltage reaches a predetermined value, the output of the NOT gate N4 becomes L level, but the other input of the NOR gate NRs is at H level. Therefore, the NOR gate NRs does not produce the clock signal.Under this condition, if the pulse output of the amplifier AM in the signal receiving part 2 lies between the lower level L1 and the upper level L2 of the normal level range as shown in Figure 11 , the comparator CM generates detecting pulse signal as shown in Figure 12 because the pulse output of the amplifier AM is above the operating level of the comparator tM. With this pulse output of the comparatorCM, synhronized signal generated by the pulse oscillator PO1 andH level output of the AND gate A2, the AND gate A4 generates the pulse output similar to that of the comparator CM as shown in Figure 12 . This output of the AND gate At sets the Q output of the circuit FF1 in the function discriminating circuit 11 at H level as shown in Figure 14 .On the other hand the Q output of the circuit FF2 remains at L level as shown in Figure 15 because the CP terminal receives no clock signal from the NOR gate NOR5. After lapse of a predetermined short time the Q output and Q output of the monostable multivibrator MM1 in the timer circuit 9 becomeL level and H level respectively as shown in Figure 6 . Consequently, the output of the AND gate A2 becomes L level as shown in Figure 8 , inhibiting operation of the AND gate A4 in the circuit 11, and rendering the transistor T1 in the circuit 10 non conductive.On the other hand, the output of the AND gate A3 becomes H level as shown in Figure 9 , the transistor T2 becomes conductive, and the operating level of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 reaches the upper level of the normal level range as shown with the symbol L2 in Figure 11 which is determined by dividing ratio of the resistors rl and r2 rs. Under this condition, if the amplifier AM ill the light rccriting part 2 ilas the normal output bs shown inFigure 11 , the output of the comparator CM is at L level as shown in Figure 12 because the output of the amplifier AM is below the level L2.When the output of the monostable multivibrator MM2 becomes L level as shown in Figure 7 after lapse of a predetermined long time, thisL level output and the output of the NOT gate N4 in the function discriminating circuit 11 at L level cause the NOR gate NRs to generate the clock signal c as shown in Figure 16 . With this signal c, theQ output of the flip flop circuit FF2 becomes H level as shown in Figure 15 because the Q output of the flip flop circuit FF1 is at H level as shown in Figure 14 .With the H level output of the flip flop circuit FF2, the NAND gate NA1 in the signal generating circuit 5 generates a pulse signal having the phase opposite to that of the pulse signal with frequency f, generated by the oscillator PO2, and the NAND gate NA2 generates a pulse signal with frequency fi as shown in Figure 20 . The clock signal from the NOR gate NR5 sets the latch Lt, formed by NOR gates NR6, NR and the output of the NOR gate NR7 becomes H level.With this H level output, the output of the NOR gate NRs in the signal transmission circuit 6 becomes L level, and the NOR gate NRs generates a pulse signal with frequency fl as shown in Figure 21 , by which conduction of the transistor T3 is controlled and the normal signal shown in Figure 2 is sent to the lines 11, 12.Lastly, as the signal receiving circuit 7 has received the reset signalP2 shown in Figure 2 and has an output P2 shown in Figure 3 on its output line d, the NOT gate N2 in the reset signal generating circuit 8 generates a clear signal c shown in Figure 4 , which resets the latches Lt2, Lt3 formed by NOR gates NR3, NR4 and NR6, NR7 respectivel in the same manner as resetting in case of fire. Then, the outputs of the NOR gates NR4, MR7 become L level as shown in Figure 5 and 17 respectively. With the L level output of the NOR gate MR, theNOR gate NR9 no longer generates the pulse signal as shown in Figure 21 , and accordingly the signal transmission circuit 6 stops transmitting the normal signal as shown in Figure 2 .The clear signal from theNOI gate N2 resets the flipflop circuit FF1 in the function discriminatin circuit 11 through the OR gate R1, and the flip flop circuit FF, directly. The Q outputs of the both circuits became L level as shown in Figures v14 , 15 . With the L level output of the flip flop circuit FF2, the output of the NAND gate NA1 in the signal generating circuit 5 become H level and the NOT gate NA2 generates the pulse signal with frequency f2 as shown in Figure 20 , thus each part of the detector returns to the original state. Now, the following describes operation of each part during the test with reference to the time chart shown in Figure 5 A in case that the output of the amplifier AM has been reduced below the lower level LI of the normal level range due to soiling by dust accumulating over the light receiving surface of the light receiving element SB in the light receiving part 2.In this case, too, the signal receiving circuit 7 in Figure l generates a pulse signal P1 in the output line d with the test start signal P1 from the control panel shownjsEigure 5 A t2 . However, due to narrow pulse width of the pulse signal P1 , the NOT gate N2 in the reset signal generating circuit 8 generates no clear signal. On the other hand the latch Lt2 formed by NOR gates NRS, NR4 in the timer circuit 9 is set as shown in Figure 5 with the pulse signal P11. When the capacitor C4 is charged with the H level output of the NOR gate NRX through the resistor rl, as shown with the dotted line inFigure 5 A 5 and the voltage reaches the H level, outputs of H level develop at the Q terminals of the monostable multivibratorsMM1, MM2 as shown in Figure 6 , 7 , and the output of the AND gateA2 becomes H level. Then, the transistor T1 in the operating level changeover circuit 10 becomes conductive as shown in Figure 8 , and the operating level of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 becomes the lower level L1 of the normal level range as shown with the dotted line in Figure 11 .With the H level output of the monostable multivibrator Mum1, the output of the NOT gate N3 in the fire discriminating part 4 becomes L level and inhibits operation of the AND gate A1, while on the other hand the NOR gate NRS in the function discriminating circuit 11 generates no clock signal as shown in Figure 16 .Under this condition, if the output of the amplifier AM in the light receiving part 2 is below the level L1 as shown in Figure 11 , the transistor T1 in the operating level changeover circuit 10 becomes conductive as shown in Figure 8 . Therefore, even if the operating level of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 becomes the lower level Li as shown in Figure 11 , no detecting signal is generated in the comparator CM as shown in Figure 12 , the AND gate Aq in the function discriminating circuit 11 has no output, and the flip flop circuit FF1 is not set as shown in Figure 14 .Then, after lapse of a predetermined time, the Q output of the monostable multivibrator MM1 in the timer circuit 9 becomes L level as shown inFigure 6, and the Q output becomes H level. The outputs of the AND gates A2, As become L and H levels respectively as shown in Figures 8 , 9 , thus rendering the transistor T1 non conductive and the transistor T2 conductive. Consequently the operating level of the comparator CM becomes the level L2 as shown in Figure 11 . Enen at this level L2, the comparator CM has no output as shown in Figure 12 , and the AND gate A5, too, has no output.After further lapse of a predetermined time the Q output of the monostable multivibrator MM2 becomes L level as shown in Figure 7 , and the NOR gate NRs generates the clock signal c shown in Figure 16 , which sets the latch Lit,. As the output of the NOR gate NRS in the signal transmission circuit 6 becomes L level with the H level output of the NOR gate NR7 shown in Figure 17 , the NOR gate NR9 generates a pulse signal with frequency f2 as shown in Figure 21 because the NAND gate NA2 in the signal generating circuit 5 is generating a pulse signal with frequency f2 as shown in Figure 20 . By the pulse signal from the NOR gate MR,, conduction of the transistor T3 is controlled, and the abnormal signal is sent to the control panel through the lines 11, 12 as shown in Figure 2 .The following describes operation of each part during the test with reference to the time chart shown in Figure 6 A , which is carried out in case the output of the amplifier AM for the light receiving element SB in the light receiving part 2 has exceeded the upper levelL2 of the normal level range due to accumulation of dust in the labyrinth.As in the case of the foregoing, the signal receiving circuit 7 inFigure 1 generates the pulse signal P1 in the output line d shown in Fis criti, the teSt start signal P1 from the cc ntrol panel shc.n in Figure 6 A 2 . Although the NOT gate N2 in the reset signal generating circuit 8 does not generate the clear signal, the latchLt2 in the timer circuit 9 is set. The capacitor C4 is charged with theH level output of the NOR gate NRh as shown with the dotted line inFigure 5 .When the voltage reaches the H level, outputs of H level develop at the Q terminals of the monostable multivibrators MM1, MM as shown in Figure 6 , 7 and the output of the AND gate A2 becomesH level. Then, the transistor T1 in the operating level changeover circuit 10 becomes conductive as shown in Figure 6 8 , and the operating level of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 becomes the lower level L1 of the normal level range as shown with the dotted line inFigure 11 .With the H level output of the Q terminal of the monostable multivibrator MM2, the output of the NOT gate Ns in the fire discriminating circuit 4 becomes L level and inhibits operation of the AND gate A1, while pun the other hand the NOR gatelNRs in the Punction discriminating circuit 11 generates no clock signalUnder this condition, if the output of the amplifier AM in the light receiving part 2 is over the level L2 as shown in Figure 11 , the transistor Ti in the operating level changeover circuit 10 become conductive as shown in Figure 8 .As the operating level of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 becomes the level L1 as shown in Figure 11 , the output of the comparator CM becomes the H level.With this output of the comparator CM, the output of the AND gate Aq in the function discriminating circuit 11 becomes H level, and accordingly the Q output of the flip flop circuit EF1 is set at H level as shown in Figure 14 . However, since the CP terminal of the flip flop circuitFF2 receives no clock signal from the NOR gate NRS, the Q output of the flip flop circuit remains at L level. After lapse of a predetermined time under this condition, the Q output of the monostable multivibrator MM1 in the timer circuit 9 becomes L level as shonw in Figure 6 and Q output becomes H level. The outputs of the AND gates A2, A3 becomeL and H levels respectively as shown in Figure 8 , 9 .Thus, the transistor T1 becomes non conductive and the transistor T2 conductive.Then, the operating level df the comparator CM changes to level L2 as shown in Figure 11 , the output of the comparator CM remains at P level. ith this output the AND gate A5 and the OR gate Rl generate H level outputs successively. With the output reaching the reset terminal R of the flip flop circuit FF1, the Q output of the flip flop circuit FF1 is reset at the L level as shown in Figure 14 .Even if the comparator CM has an output thereafter, the Q output of the flip flop circuit FF1 remains at L level as shown in Figure 14 as long as the operating level of the comparator CM is at the level L2, because the output of the comparator CM reaches the R terminal of the flip flop circuit FF1 through the AND gate A5 and the OR gate R1. As in the previous case, after lapse of a predetermined time the Q output of the monostable multivibrator MM2 becomes L level as shown in Figure 7 , and the NOR gate NRT in the circuit 11 generates the clock signal c shown in Figure 16 , which sets the latch Lots. As the NOR gate NR, has H level output shown in Figure 17 , and the output of the NOR gate MR8 in the signal transmission circuit 6 becomes the L level, the NAND gate NA2 in the signal generating circuit 5 generates a pulse signal with frequency f2 as shown in Figure 20 , and accordingly the NOR gate MR, generates a pulse signal of frequency f2 as shown in Figure 21 to control conduction of the transistor T5 and to send an abnormal signal to the control panel through the lines 11, 12 as shown in Figure 2 .Now, the following describes how the signal receiving circuit 7 operates with the reset signal P2 shown in Figure 5 A and 6 A 2 and received from the control panel after the test conducted in case that the output of the amplifier AM has fallen below the lower level L1 and exceeded the upper level L2. The signal receiving circuit 7 generates a pulse signalP21 shown in Figure 3 in the output line d. The NOT gate N2 in the reset signal generating circuit 8 generates the clear signal c shown in Figure 6 4 , with vhich the latches Lt2, Lt3 formed by NOR gates NR3, NR4 and NR6, NR, respectively are reset. Then, the outputs of the NOR gates NR4, NR, become L level as shown in Figures 5 and 17 .Because of this L level output of the NOR gate NRI, the NOR gate NRg no longer generates the pulse signal as shown in Figure 21 , and the signal transmission circuit 6 stops transmitting the abnormal signal to the lines 11, 12 as shown in Figure 2 , thus each part of the detector resets to the original condition.Lastly, the following describes operation of the control panel when the test is conducted with the test start signal from the control panel shown in Figure 2. When the switch SST1 is closed for testing, the relay X operates to clse the contacts xl X3 and open the contact x. Therefore, on receipt of the normal signal from the detector shown inFigure l, the relay N operates and close the contact N1, and the normal indicator lamp La3 lights. When the abnormal signal is received, the relay M operates and closes the contacts ml, m2 to cause the abnormal indicator lamp La2 to light up indicating that there is abnormality in the smoke detecting function. As the switch 5W2 is closed to reset the detector, the relay Y operates and closes the contact y1 and opens the contact y2 to actuate the reset signal generator RS which sends the reset signal to the lines 11, 12.At the same time, operation of the relay X is stopped and the contacts xl, x2, x, are opened to prevent the test signal generator TS from operating and to extinguish the normal indicator lamps La2, La3. The contact X4 is closed to reset the control panel in the normal supervisory condition. Figure 7 is a circuit diagram of another embodiment according to the present invention relating to a light extinction type smoke detector which detects smoke on light extinctrion prlndple. The circuit diagram of the control panel used for this embodiment is the same as Figure 2. The light extinction type smoke detector shown in Figure 7 only differs from Figure 1 in that the resistors Ti re are connected in series across the conductors a, b in opposite order to determine the upper level L1 of the normal level range as threshold level at which alarm failure or delayed alarm is likely to occur, t lower level L2 as threshold level at which false alarm is likely to be produced, and the fire level ls, and that the voltage of operating level developing at the junction of the resistors rl and r2 is applied to the terminal of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 and the output of the amplifier AM in the light receiving part 2 is led to the terminal so that the comparator CM generates the detecting output when the output of the amplifier AM has fallen below the operating level.Therefore, as compared with the time chart of Figure 3 A of the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the normal supervisory state of this embodiment and the operating state of each part in case of fire only differs in the outputs of the amplifier AM in the light receiving part 2 and of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 as shown in Figures V and t12j. Therefore, these different outputs shown with Figures 11 , 12 are extracted and indicated at the lower part of Figure 3 A as Figures B 11 , 12 . Now, operation of the embodiment is described with reference to Figures 3 A but 11 , 12 , and B 11 , 12 . With respect to Figure 3 A some descriptions have already been made, and only their summary is given hereunder. In normal supervisory condition without smoke the transistor T1 in the signal receiving circuit 7 is conducting and its output line d has no output as shown in the left part of Figure 3 . Consequently, the outputs of the reset signal generating circuit 8 and of the AND gates A2, A3 in the timer circuit 9 are L level, and the transistors Tl, T2 in the operating level changeover circuit 10 do not conduct. As the operating level of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 is at the fire level L3 e.g. 85 light transmittivity of the output of the amplifier AM as indication of light transmittivity while no smoke presents , the comparator CM has the L level output shown in Figure 12 and the output of the AND gate A1 is at the L level when the amplifier AM generates a pulse signal exceeding the level L, shown in Figure 11 .Consequently, no signal is sent to the lines li, 12. Nevertheless, when the amplifier AM has generated a pulse signal below the fire level as shown Figure 11 t as a result of entry of smoke from fire between the light emitting element LE in the light emitting part 1 and the light receiving element SB in the light receiving part 2, the comparator CM has the H level output as shown in Figure 12 , with which and the synchronizing signal from the oscillator PO1 and the H level output of the NOT gate N theAND gate A1 in the fire detecting part 4 generates a pulse signal corresponding to the output of the comparator CM. Then, the latch Ltl formed by the NOR gates NR1, NR2 is set as shown in Figure 13 .With the H level output of the NOR gate MR21 a fire signal with frequency f2 shown in Figure 2 is sent to the lines 11, 12 through the signal transmission circuit 6. Operation of the control panel after receipt of this fire signal and resetting of the fire detector by reset signal from the control panel are same as in the case of the light scattering type smoke detector.Operation of each part at the time of the test while the output of t. .. .plif er AY. ifl the light receiving part q of this embodiment only differs in Figure ill showing the output of the amplifier AM in the light receiving part 2 and Figure 12 showing the output of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 as compared with the time chart, Figure 4 A for the embodiment shown in Figure 1. Therefore, only these different outputs shown with Figures 11 , 12 are extracted and indicated at the lower part of Figure 4 A as Figure B 11 , 12 . Now, operation of the embodiments is described with reference to Figures 4 A but 11 , 12 , and B 11 , 12 . With the test start signalP1 shown in Figure 2 from the control panel the signal receiving circuit 7 generates a pulse output PI shown in Figure 3 in its output line d, but the reset signal generating circuit 8 does not generate the clear signal due to the narrow pulse width. The pulse signal P1 sets the latch Lt2 formed by NOR gates NR NRL in the timer circuit 9. With the H level output of the NOR gate NRX shown in Figure 5 the capacitor Cq is charged as shown with the dotted line on figure 5 .As the voltage of the capacitor Cq reaches the H level, the clock signal is transmitted to the CP terminals of the monostable multivibrators MMl, MM2. Then, the 9 terminals of the monostable multivibrators Mum1, MM2 have H level outputs as shown in Figures 6 , 7 , with which the output of the AND gate A2, too, become the H level as shown in Figure 8 , and the transistor T1 in the operating level changeover circuit 10 becomes conductive.The operating level of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 becomes the upper level L1 of the normal level range e.g. 105 light transmittivity as shown with the dotted lime in Figure 111 . Under this condition, if the pulse output of the amplifier AM in the light receiving part 2 lies between the upper level Ll and the lower level L2 of the normal level range as shown in Figure 11 , the pulse output is below the operating level of the comparator CM. Therefore, the comparator CM has no L level output, but H level output as shown in Figure 12 . With this H level output and the synchronizing signal from the oscillator POl and theH level output of the AND gate A2, the AND gate A4 generates a pulse output which is similar to that shown in Figure 12 .By this pulse signal the output of the Q terminal of the flip flop circuit FFl in the function discriminating circuit 11 is set at H level. However, since no clock signal is transmitted from the NOR gate NR5 to the CP terminal of the flip flop circuit FF2, the output of the Q terminal remains at L level as shown in Figure 15 After lapse of a predetermined time the output of the Q terminal of the monostable multivibrator MM1 in the timer circuit 9 becomes L level as shown in Figure 6 , and the output of the Q terminal becomes H level. The outputs of theAND gates A2 and As become L and H levels respectively as shown in Figures 8 and 9 .In the operating level changeover circuit 10, the transistor T1 stops conducting and the transistor T2 become conductive, thus the operating level of the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 becomes the lower level L2 of the normal level range. Under this condition, the output of the amplifier AM in the light receiving part 2, if generated, is above the level L2, and therefore the output of the comparator CM becomes the L level as shown in Figure 12 . When the output of the monostable multivibrator MM2 in the timer circuit 9 become L level as shown in Figure 7 after lapse of a predetermined time, this L level output and the L level output of the NOT gate N4 in the function discriminating circuit 11 cause the NOR gate NRs to generate the clock signal c as shown in Figure 16 .With this signal c the flip flop circuit FF2 has the H level output shown in Figure 15 at the Q terminal. With this H level output and the H level output shown in Figure 17 of the NOR gate NR7 of the latch Lt3 which is set by the clock signal c, the normal signal shown in Figure 2 is sent to the lines 11, 12 through the signal generating circuit 5 and the signal transmission circuit 6. As the signal receiving circuit 7 receives from the control panel the reset signal P2 shown in Figure 2 , each part of the fire detector returns to its original state in the same manner as the light scattering type smoke detector.Operation of each part at the time of the test in case the output of the light receiving element SB in the light receiving element 2 has increased due to influence of the external light and the output of the amplifier AM has exceeded the upper level Ll of the normal level range only differs in Figure 11 showing the output of the amplifierAM and Figure 12 showing the output of the comparator CM in the com parison part 3 as compared with the time chart, Figure 5 A for the embodiment shown in Figure 1. Therefore, only these different outputs shown in Figures 11 , 12 are extracted and indicated at the lower part of Fige 5 A as Figure B 11 , 12 . Nw, peratioll rtf the embodiment is described with reference to Figure 5 A but 11 , 12 , and to Figures B 11 , 12 . With the test start signal P1 shown in Figure 2 the signal receiving circuit 7 generates a pulse output Psl shown in Figure 3 in its output line d, but the reset signal generating circuit 8 does not generate a clear signal due to the narrow pulse width. The pulse signal P1 sets the latch Lt2 formed by NOR gates NR3, NRX in the timer circuit 9.With the H level output of the NOR gate NR4 shown in Figure 5 , the H level outputs shown in Figures 6 , 7 appear on the Q terminals of the monostable multivibrators MM1, MM2, and the output of the AND gate A2 becomes H level, and the transistor T1 in the operating level changeover circuit 10 becomes conductive as shown in Figure 8 .Thus, the operating level of the comparator CM becomes the upper levelL1 of the normal level range as shown with the dotted line in Figure 11 . Under this condition, if the output of the amplifier AM in the light receiving part 2 is above the upper level LJ, the comparator CM in the comparison part 3 has no output as shown im Figure 12 , sand rShe transistors Ti, T2 in the operating level changeover circuit 10 become conductive as shown in Figures 8 , 9 . Therefore, even if the operating level of the comparator CM has changed from the levelL1 to the level T2, the comparator CM has no output.After lapse of a predetermined time the output of the Q terminal of the monostable multivibrator MM2 becomes L level as shown in Figure 7 . The NOR gate NRs in the smoke detecting function discriminating circuit 11 generates the clock signal c shown in Figure 16 , and the NOR gate NR, has the H level output as shown in Figure 17 . The output of theNOR gate NRs in the signal transmission circuit 6 becomes L level.Then, the NOR gate MR, generates a pulse output with frequency f2 as shown in Figure 21 to send the abnormal signal to the lines 11, 12 as shown in Figure 2 .Operation of each part at the time of the testfin case the output of the amplifier AM has fallen below the lower level L2 of the normal level range due to soiling of the light receiving surface of the light receiving element SB in the light receiving part 2 by dust only differs in Figure 11 showing the output of the amplifier AM and Figure 12 showing the output of the comparator CM as compared with the time chart, Figure 6 A for the embodiment shown in Figure 1. Therefore, only these different outputs shown in Figures 11 , 12 are extracted and indicated at the lower part of Figure 6 A as Figures B 11 , 12 . Now, operation of the embodiment is described with reference to Figure 6 A but 11 , 12 , and to Figures B 11 , 12 . With the test start signal P1 shown in Figure 2 the signal receiving circuit 7 generates a pulse output P1 with narrow width shown in Figure 3 in its output line d, but the reset signal generating circuit 8 does not generate a clear signal. The latch Lt2 formed by NOR gates NR3, NR4 is set. With the H level output of the NOR gate NR4 shown inFigure 5 the H level outputs shown in Figures 6 , 7 appear on the Q terminals of the monostable multivibrators MMI, MM2, and the output of the AND gate A2 becomes H level, and the transistor T1 in the operating level changeover circuit 10 becomes conductive as shown in Figure 8 . Thus, the operating level of the comparator CM becomes the upper level Lo of the normal level range as shown with the dotted line in Figure 11 . If the output of the amplifierAM in the light receiving part 2 is below the lower level L2 of the normal level range at this time, the comparator CM has no L level output but the H level output as shown in Figure 12 . With thisH level output the AND gate A4 in the function discriminating circuit 11 generates a pulse output similar to that shown in Figure 12 .This pulse output sets the output of the Q terminal of the flip flop circuit at H level as shown in Figure 14 , but the output of theQ terminal of the flip flop circuit FF2 remains at L level because no clock signal is transmitted to the CP terminal of the flip flop circuit FF2. Under this condition, the transistor T2 soon becomes conductive in place of the transistor T1 as shown in Figure 9 , and the orating level of the comparator CM changes to the level L2 as shown in Figure 31 . In this case, too, the output of the comparator CM is at H level, with which the AND gate A5 and OR gateR1 successively generate H level outputs to the R terminal of the flip flop circuit FF1, the Q output of which becomes the L level as shown in Figure 14 .After lapse of a predetermined time as the output of the Q terminal of the monostable multivibrator MM2 becomes L level as shown in Figure 7 , and the NOR gate NRS in the function discriminating circuit 11 generates the clock signal c as shown in Figure 16 , the latch Ltt formed by NOR gates NRe, NR7 is set. Then, the NOR gate NR7 has a H level output as shown inFigure 17 , and the abnormal signal is transmitted to the control panel through the signal transmission circuit 6 and the lines li, 12 in the same manner as described with regard to Figure 6 A for the light scattering type smoke detector.Operation of the smoke detector when its signal receiving circuit 7 has received the reset signal P2 from the control panel after the test in case the output of the amplifier AM exceeded the upper level L1 of the normal level range and fallen below the lower level L2, and operation of the control panel when tested with the test start signal from the control panel are same as in the case of the light scattering type smoke detector.In the both cases of the light scattering type and light extinction type smoke detectors, if there is a trouble in the detector circuit or interruption of the lines li, 12, and neither normal signal nor abnormal signal from the detector reaches the control panel despite the lapse of the operating time of the timer T after the test start signal is sent from the control panel shown in Figure 2, the timer T operates and closes its contact t to operate the trouble indicator lamp La4, by which it is possible to know the trouble in the detector circuit or lines 11, 12. In the above embodiments, the descriptions are made with respect to such cases that the smoke detector and the control panel are connected by two lines which are commonly used as power supply lines and signal lines. However, in Figures 1 and 7 the terminal on the right side of the voltage stabilizing circuit CV may be disconnected from the line 11 and connected with a third line 13 which is exclusively used for power supply so that the power supply lines may be separated from the signal lines to avoid influence of the pulse signal width upon the voltage stabilizing circuit and to get a larger S N ratio. As can be seen from the above description, the photoelectric type smoke detector equipped with smoke detecting function test means according to this invention has such as advantage that with proper composition it is capable of automatically, readily and precisely checking, on the basis of the signal sent from the control panel through the lines connecting the smoke detector with the control panel, whether the output of the detector is within the normal level range which cause no false alarm, alarm failure nor delayed alarm, i.e. an important function of this type of detector, and of reporting to the control panel on results of the test through the same lines.4.
