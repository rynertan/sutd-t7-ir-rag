# Flame detection circuit.

## Abstract
A flame detection circuit including an ultraviolet respon sive tube 11 is provided with a safety circuit to avoid malfunction due to a short circulating of the tube. The safety circuit encompasses a pulse responsive circuit 50 that is responsive to the characteristic conduction pattern of the ultraviolet tube 11 and will not respond to a shunt resistance. The circuit relies on the normal conductivity of a shorting field effect transistor 60 that must be gated into a nonconductive state for an output 42 to be activated.
