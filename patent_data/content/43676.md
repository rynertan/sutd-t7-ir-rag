# Apparatus and method of determining the content of a gas bottle.

## Abstract
A gauge and a method for assessing the content of releas able gas in a bottle of compressed or liquified gas, in which the weight of the content is assessed by determining the force re quired to cause the bottle to pivot about a point on its lower periphery. The gauge has a platform 16 pivoted about a hori zontal edge on a frame 10, 12 and is spring urged upwardly. This causes the bottle to pivot about a diametrically opposed point on the bottle rim periphery, provided the spring 32 exerts a sufficient force. The platform 16 is connected to a pointer 25 , which sweeps across a scale provided on the fra me 10. A screw threaded adjuster 33, 34 is arranged to pre load the spring 32 , thereby to allow alignment of the pointer 25 with a full marking on the scale when the gauge is first positioned beneath a full gas bottle thereafter the remaining content can be assessed by the instantaneous indication.
