# Control of individual section glassware forming machine.

## Abstract
An individual section glassware forming machine has three operating stations including an intermediate reheating station B and a shaping station C . Transfer means 5 for carrying parisons from the intermediate station B to the shaping station C is controlled by means of an electrical command signal the magnitude of which varies in accord ance with a desired position against time curve for the movement of a reheated parison. The signal is supplied to an electrical or hydraulic servo mechanism 34 42 which is operated by the electrical command signal to control the movement of the transfer means 5 .
