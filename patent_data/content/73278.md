# Cardan shaft vehicle transmission.

## Abstract
The front wheel drive for a tractor comprises a Cardan shaft 22 driving a wheel hub 16 by way of bevel gears in a gear casing 18, 20 . The shaft has a universal joint at its front end adjacent the gear casing enclosed within a protec tive sleeve 24 . In order to obtain trouble free access to the grease nipple on the universal joint, the protective sleeve is releasably mounted on a support ring 26 fixed to the gear casing by way of legs 28 straddling the cover part 20 of the gear casing, with their ends fixed by the bolts 34 attaching the cover part. The sleeve has at least one L slot 38 meeting a bayonet connection with a bolt 34 fixed through the support ring. A nut 40 , e.g. a wing nut, on the bolt 34 is tightened onto the sleeve to secure its attach ment. In order to obtain access to the grease nipple, the nut is slackened off, the sleeve is rotated and is then slid axially back along the shaft 22 to expose the grease nipple, irre spective of the radial position of the grease nipple.
