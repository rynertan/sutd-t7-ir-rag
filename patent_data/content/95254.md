It is an object of the present invention to provide a composite cable for use between a switch board ard ain electrical control unit in which an optical fiber for transmitting optical information from the switch board to the main control unit and a plurality of conductors for transmitting electrical signals from the main control imit to the switch board are combined to form a ccmposite cabl in order to simplify installation and save wiring space. A more complete understanding of the present inventIon may be obtained from the following description taken in conjunction with the drawings in which like reference numeral designate corresponding elements and in which wig. 1 is a perspective view in cross section of a first preferred. embodiment of a composite cajole according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a perspective view in cross section of a second embodiment of a composite cable acording to the present invention Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of a third embodiment of the composite cable according to the invention Fig. 4 is a longitudinally sectioned view of opposing ends of two coaxial composite cables Fig. 5 is a perspective view of opposing ends of the two coaxial composite cables shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 is a longitudinally sectioned view of opposing ends of the two coaxial composite cables wherein the two coaxial composite cables are interconnected. As shown in Fig. 1, an optical fiber 1 is located along the center of the composite cable for transmitting an optical signal from an optical transmitting unit to a receiving unit. A plurality of conductors 2 made of an electrically conductive metal such as copper are disposed around the optical fiber 1 sc as to srietrically surround the optical fiber 1. Furthermore, the optical fiber 1 a plurality of conductors 2 are coated with an insulating material 3 so that the cross section of the composite cable A is circular. In this embodiment, the plurality of conductors 2 constitute a sIngle wire. e composite cable r can be use1 to connect a power supply line of the optical transmittinG unit not shown to that of the optical receiving unit not shown via the signal line comprising the plurality of conductors 2 and to connect an output tort of the potical transmitting unit to an input port of the optical receiving unit. Consequently, all of the required wiring between the optical transmitting and receiving units can be carried out with a single composite cable A. As shown in Fig. 2, in the second embodiment of the cable A , four conductors are defined by bundling separate wires together and each of the four conductors 2a to 2d is separately disposed around the periphery of the optical fiber 1. The optical fiber 1 and the group of conductors 2a to 2d are coated with an insulating material 3. The composite cable shown in Fig. 2 can be used to simplIfy the wiring between communication units which can send and receive optical and electrical signals simultaneously. AS shown in Fig. 3, in the third embodiment of the cable A, the optical fiber 1 is located at the center of the cable A and coated with the insulating material 3. A plurality of conductors are collected and divided into four groups 2a to 2d1. They are arranged and symmetrically around and concentric with the optical fiber 1. A cable sheath 4 covers the insulating material which in turn Isolates each of the conductor groups 2a to 2d , and the optical fiber 1. In the first, second, and third embodiments, the optical fiber and electrical conductors are arranged in a coaxial config Jration. Alternatively, the composite in cable may be arranged In a parallel line cable or multI conductor cable configuration. In addition, although the number of conductor groups as shown inFigs. 2 and 3 is four, the number be selected arbitrarily according to the sItua on. Fig. 4 shows an example of two composite cables A and A which can be interconnected at opposing ends. The optical fiber 1 is exposed at one end of a male type composite cable X, i.e., it extends beyond the end of the insulating material 3. The corresponding ends of the conductors 2 are folded over the end of the Insulating aerial 3 and secured within a sleeve 5 made of conductive metal by nears of cringing so that the end of the optical fiber 1 projects from the sleeve 5.One end of the optical fiber 1 of the other composite cable A is also exposed and the corresponding ends of the conductors 2 are also folded over the end of the insulating material al. A female socket 6 made of conductive metal is secured over the exposed ends of the optical ice 1 , conductors 2 , and insulating aterral 3 by means of crimping. The female socket 6 tapers outwardly from the end of the cable A as seer rom Fig. 4. he sleeve 5 is fitted into the fenale socket 6 so as to wring the end of the optical fiber 1 of one composite cable S Into contact with that 1 of the other composite cable . In this case, the sleeve 5 is also in close contact with the female socket c. Hi. 5 is a perspective view c two composite cables shown in Fig. 4.

As shown in Fig. , the end of the optical fiber 1 of the composite cable A is brought in close contact with the opposing enc of the optical fiber 1 of the other composite cable A . At this time, the sleeve 5 and the female socket 6 are secured together to connect the composite cable A to the other composite cable . In Fig. 6, an insulating capsule 7 is provided f cr sealing the two cables A and A since the ends of the cables A and A would otherwise be exposed to atmosphere. Although the sleeve 3 and the female socket 6 are fixed by crimping to the conductors 2, 2 at the end of the corresponding composite cable, these two terminals 5 and 6 nay alternatively be fixed thereto by soldering. In tills way, two composite cables A and A can be interconnected so that an optical signal can Be transmitted across the interconnected ends of the optical fibers. In addition, power may be conducted over the conductors of the two interconnected composite cables A and A .
