# NEMATODE CONTROL USING SOIL BACTERIA

## Abstract
This invention relates to bacteria which are capable of proliferating in a environment which is infested with nema todes such as pseudomonads which colonize the surfaces of plant roots under conditions of microbial competition, and which inhibit nematodes. This invention also relates to a method of using such bacteria to inhibit nematodes This invention also involves the transformation of bac teria with foreign genes which express glycosidase enzymes such as Î² galactosidase and or chitinase, which can inhibit one or more types of nematodes Methods are disclosed herein for 1 selecting suitable bacteria which can colonize a target environment, such as the root surfaces of a particular type of plant 2 transform ing a selected bacteria with foreign genes which encode chitinase and or glycosidase enzymes, preferably under the control of a strong promoter and 3 determining whether the bacteria effectively inhibit a selected type of nematode in the target environment.
