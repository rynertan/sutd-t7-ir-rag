# Channel plate electron multipliers.

## Abstract
Channel plate image intensifiers, for use as raster intensifiers in cathode ray tubes for example, comprise a stack of alternately arranged perforate laminar dynodes M and perforate laminar separators D aligned to form electron multiplier channels P. Each of the separators comprise a perforate aluminium plate having an anodized layer some 15 microns thick on the plate surface. Such separators can be manufactured to have the desired electrical characteristics and uniform thickness over their entire area so that the dynodes M are parallel to each other and provide a uniform gain over their entire area. The invention also relates to a method of anodizing perforate and imperforate aluminium foils.
