# Element basket assembly for heat exchanger.

## Abstract
An element basket assembly 30 for a rotary regenera tive heat exchanger 2 comprised of a plurality of heat transfer element plates 32 stacked in an array between first and second end plates 34,36 disposed at opposite ends of the stacked array of heat transfer element plates 32 . First and second side straps 40,50 run along opposite sides of the stacked array of heat transfer element plates, to intercon nect the first and second end plates 34,36 to form the element basket housing the heat transfer element plates. The first side strap 40 is disposed to extend diagonally from a higher location on the first end plate 34 to a location on the second end plate 36 , while the second side strap 50 is disposed on the opposite side of the stacked array to extend diagonally from a lower location on the first end plate 34 to a higher location on the second end plate 36 , that is diagonally opposite to the first side strap 40 .
