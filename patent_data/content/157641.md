# Tile having nozzle.

## Abstract
A roof tilt having a lead in hole 7 for antenna cables or other elongate elements of rooftop fixtures comprises a tile body 1 , a pedestal 4 integrally formed on the upper central surface of the tile body 1 , a nozzle 6 integrally formed on the pedestal 4 , and a pipe joint 9 having a base 10 and a bent leading end 11 . The pedestal 4 has a bolt hole 5 bored therein so as to extend through the tile body 1 for inserting an anchor bolt 14 thereinto to fix the tile body 1 to a roof board. The nozzle 6 has an annular rib 8 formed on the upper periphery thereof and a nozzle hole 7 formed therein so as to extend through both the pedestal 4 and the tile body 1 to serve as the leading hole. The base 10 of the pipe joint 9 is adapted to be fitted around the nozzle 6 and to be fixed to the nozzle 6 by a bolt 12 screwed therein and brought into collision contact with the periphery of the nozzle at a position below the annular rib 8 . The bent leading end 11 of the pipe joint is directed towards the upper surface of the tile body 1 .
