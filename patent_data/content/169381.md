# Mechanical perspective drafting device.

## Abstract
Mechanical perspective drafting device, characterized by a first drafting board 8b which is fitted with a second drafting board 5b with a fixed support 13 which includes a universal joint 1b through which a long member 6b can slide and rotate freely, the long member 6b being fitted with a drawing device ending with a point 14 which can come in contact with the second drafting board 5b , the line 6b which is connecting the universal joint 1b and the point 14 is passing through an imaginary three dimensional figure 3b and this causes the point 14 to draw a perspective projection of the figure 3b as it is seen from the position of the universal joint 1b , the movement of the line 6b through the figure 3b is assisted by a tracing guide 18,19 which guides the long member 6b .
