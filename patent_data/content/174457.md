# Transistor devices for microwave oscillator elements.

## Abstract
A transistor device for a microwave oscillating element having an FET transistor chip and a package encapsulating the chip therein. In order to prevent the external circuit influencing the input impedance of the transistor device and to make the phase rotation low at a frequency band higher than the X band, a conductor element 5 is provided within the package to connect the drain electrode 22 of the chip 2 and a corresponding terminal 32 of the package. The conductor element has an inductance to provide a sufficient ly high impedance at the intended frequency band. The conductor element is supported on an insulator plate 4 fixedly mounted within the package.
