# Tungsten recovery.

## Abstract
Tungsten can be extracted into solution from tungsten carbide powder residues with aqueous hydrogen peroxide to a greater extent by employing in solution a catalytic quantity of hydrochloric acid, such as a mole ratio to the tungsten preferably in the range of at least 0.1 1 moles of HCl per mole tungsten, and often up to about 2.5 moles of HCl per mole of tungsten at 55 to 85 C. The selection of the mole ratio in practice usually takes into account the grade of tungsten carbide starting material. It is very preferable to use at least 7 moles hydrogen peroxide per mole of tungsten and an extraction temperature of 65 to 75 C.
