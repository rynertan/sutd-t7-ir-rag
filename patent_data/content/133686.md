## Description
CHLOROSULFONATED POLYOLEFIN PROCESS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polyethylene elastomers are chlorosulfonated commercially by dissolving polyethylene in a solvent such as carbon tetrachloride, along with a catalyst, and bubbling chlorine and sulfur dioxide through the solution. A process that eliminates the need for the solvent is described in British Patent Specification 815,234, whereby polyethylene of a particle size not greater than 0.25 mm is chlorosulfonated in the absence of a solvent or other liquid phase, with a gaseous mixture of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at a temperature not substantially above 1000C, preferably 40 80 C. The ratio of sulfur dioxide to chlorine is a mol ratio of 1 1 and 2 1, and the resulting polymers have sulfur contents as high as 10 and chlorine contents as high as about 20 by weight. While this represents an improvement over the prior art solution methods, the resulting polymer products are not uniformly chlorosulfonated and result in poor stability, processing and other problems, as well as not providing chlorosulfonated elastomers that can be vulcanized to obtain optimum physical properties and in forms for a varity of applications. There is described in U.S. Patent 3,258,445 an improved process that eliminates some of the processing disadvantages of the earlier solvent free systems as described above by chlorosulfonating the polyolefin in finely divided form in the presence of quaternary ammonium salts or tertiary amines at a temperature which is above or equal to the starting temperature of the endothermal fusion phenomenon characteristic of the polymer treated. This process is conducted in two stages, in a first stage at a temperature below the lower temperature limit of the melting range of the polymer, partially chlorinating the polymer, then adding the quaternary ammonium salt or amine and raising the temperature as high as the lower temperature limit of the melting range of the polymer and adding a mixture of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.In chlorosulfonating at high temperatures, the polymer may deteriorate and the particles form small balls or adhere to the walls of the reactor. A disadvantage of this complex process is that there is a loss in thermal stability of the chlorosulfonated polyolefin containing the quaternary ammonium salts or amine. The organic additives may form toxic by products during the reaction. Another attempt to eliminate problems in fluid bed processes for chlorosulfonating polyethylene is described in U.S. Patent 2,928,819, wherein the use of 50 or more by weight of magnesia, aluminum sulfate, sodium chloride and the like is proposed, but the use of such large.amounts of inorganic materials also introduce handling and other problems, including separation of these materials from the polymer, and are not satisfactory for a commercial process. A major problem in fluid bed processes is electrostatic charging occurring in the fluid bed with subsequent problems in bed mixing and stability, heat transfer, and build up of polymer deposits on wall surfaces. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Finely divided polyolefins including polyethylene are chlorosulfonated with chlorine and sulfur di oxide in vapor phase in the presence of an inorganic compound inert under free radical reaction conditions and having a specific volume conductivity of A lcm 1 value of greater than 10 3, at an initial temperature between about 200C and 700C and thereafter at temperature of at least about the crystalline melting point of the polyethylene and continuing the reaction to obtain a stable chlorosulfonated polyethylene elastomer containing about 25 to about 45 weight percent chlorine and 0.5 to 3 weight percent sulfur, having good processing properties and that can be readily cured to form vulcanizates useful in a variety of applications.This process is not subject to electrostatic charging in the fluid bed and is free of other problems of prior art processes. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Any polyolefin can be used including low and high density, linear and branched, made by high and low pressure processes. Typical materials include polyethylene, polybutene, copolymers and the like. The preferred polyethylene used may have a molecular weight from about 20,000 to several million, preferably from 50,000 to 200,000. The melt index will range from 0.01 to less than 30, preferably from 0.2 to 18. The density may be from about 0.90 to 0.97, preferably 0.92 to 0.965, and the crystalline melting point from about 100 C to 1400C, preferably 1200C to 1360C. The average particle size will be from greater than 50, preferably greater than 75 to less than 800 microns, preferably 100 microns to less than 600 microns.For uniform chlorine content it is preferred to use polyethylene with a narrow range of average particle sizes no greater than about 200 microns, more preferably no greater than 100 microns, based on the average particle size.For example, a polyethylene with a mixture of particle sizes from 100 to 250 microns is satisfactory, as is a mixture of sizes from 500 to 600 microns, although the larger particle size may require a longer reaction time to reach the desired chlorine and sulfur content.The term polyethylene is understood to include copolymers of ethylene with other alpha olefines, preferably containing 3 to 6 carbon atoms and in amounts less than 10 weight percent, for example 5 butene l. Other polyolefins include polypropylene and polybutene l. The inorganic materials used have specific volume conductivity values of greater than 10 3 to 102 n lcm l in the temperature range from 20 140 C, preferably at least about 10 1 to 101. Typical compounds that meet these requirements are sodium aluminas, NaA111O17 having a conductivity of 10l, NaAl7O11 and NaAl5O8 AgA111O17 Na3Zr2PSi2012 CeO 12 mol CaO ZrO2 12 mol CaO NaGall0l7, and the like. These materials preferably are inert to sulfur dioxide, chlorine and hydrogen chloride under the described reaction conditions. Inorganic materials that do not meet these criteria and are otherwise unsatisfactory in the process of this invention are silica, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, all having a specific volume conductivity of less than 10 3. Particularly useful is sodium ss alumina NaA111O17 . The amounts used will be from at least 1 to about 10 to 15 or more weight parts per 100 weight parts of polyolefin. Large amounts may be used if desired, but are not normally necessary. The number average particle size is from about 0.05 to 10, preferably about 0.2 to 1 microns. Particularly useful are particles of about 0.1 to 1.0 micron size. The ratio of chlorine to sulfur dioxide used on a volume basis at standard temperature and pressure 250C, 0.1 MPa has an effect on the final composition of the polymer as to chlorine and sulfur content, and it may vary from 20 1 to 1 2, preferably 4 1 to 1 1 of chlorine to sulfur dioxide. The reaction is generally continued.until the polymers contain between 25 and 45 weight percent chlorine and this is determined by the change in polymer density, the amount of HC1 evolved during the chlorosulfonation, etc. The ratio may be varied during the course of the reaction, and all of the SO2 may be added in the initial or later part of the reaction. While an inert diluent gas is not necessary, inert gases such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide and the like may be used. Unreacted S02 and C12 may be recycled, and this may include some HC1 byproduct which will build up over a period of time. This normally is bled off to keep the concentration in the reactor at a concentration of less than 50 , HC1, preferably about 25 to 30 . In the process, minimum concentration of oxygen should be in the feed streams and reactor. The mamimum amount of oxygen in the reactor should be below 300 ppm, preferably below 150 ppm. The chlorosulfonation is started at a temperature between about 200C and 700C, and the temperature is raised to at least about the crystalline melting point of the polyolefin. The usual operating temperature of the reaction at this stage with polyethylene, after the polyethylene contains about 15 to 25 weight percent chlorine, is about 100C above the initial polyethylene crystalline melting point, or about 1100C to about 1500C, depending on the initial polyethylene melting point. One benchmark to use in determining at what point to raise the reaction temperature is when the polyethylene contains greater than about 20 weight percent bound chlorine. Vapor phase bulk chlorosulfonation of polyolefin in accordance with this invention is contemplated for a variety of conditions and equipment, both batch and continuous. Any means known to those skilled in the art for vapor phase chlorosulfonation of polyolefins may be used to conduct the reaction, for example, a rotary drum, a moving bed, horizontal stirred reactor, but more preferably in a fluidized bed of the polyethylene and defined inorganic compound. The fluidized bed reaction normally is conducted at about atmospheric pressure and typically at superficial velocities of reactant gases of about 0.2 to 5 feet per second, preferably about 1 to 1.5 feet per second. Light can be used to initiate the reaction in order to increase the rate of reaction. While light from daylight sources, incandescant bulbs and the like may be used, ultraviolet light is more efficient and this is preferably used initially in the reaction at least until the reaction temperature has reached the polyolefin melting point and may be used throughout the reaction. The reaction can also be initiated by generating free radicals thermally as by decomposition of peroxide or azo catalysts. Thermally generated chlorine radicals are also sufficient to initiate the reaction. At the conclusion of the reaction, the polymer is removed from the reactor and the unreacted and byproduct gases must be removed as by stripping. The reaction temperature of the polymer is preferably lowered to about 800C to 1100C, and the polymer is purged with nitrogen or stripped under vacuum to remove unreacted S02, C12, and byproduct HC1. In the fluidized bed process for chlorosulfonat ion of polyolefin mixed with the defined inorganic compounds, improvement is obtained in bed mixing of the reactants and heat transfer, with minimum polymer deposition on reactor walls and minimum agglomeration in the fluidized bed, essentially eliminating undesirable channeling and bed breakdown, to provide an improved process and product. The resulting chlorosulfonated polyolefins contain about 25 to about 45 weight percent chlorine, with the optimum being about 35 to 38 weight percent.The sulfur, present as SO2C1, calculated as sulfur, will range from about 0.5 to 3 weight percent, which results in a vulcanizable elastomer that can be cured in many ways, including metal oxide sulfur cures. The resulting elastomers have a 4 minute ML Mooney value at 1000C of about 15 to 150, normally about 35 to 120. In the following examples the powdered polyethylene was blended with sodium t alumina as described and charged to a fluid bed reactor provided with means for heating and cooling and purged with nitrogen. The reactions were started at room temperature by introducing chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The temperature of the bed was increased by heating the reactor and incoming gases. As the temperature reached the melting point of the polyolefin, the bed and reaction temperature was controlled by cooling the reactor and or diluting the reactants with nitrogen. The end of the reaction was determined by the total uptake of chlorine required to reach the desired chlorine content.The maximum temperature is maintained near or above the melting temperature of the polyolefin to assure a reduced residual crystallinity, and at a chlorine content of about 36 , elastomeric behavior. At the end of the reaction a purge with nitrogen at about 1100C degases the polymer powder to contain less than 40 ppm of C1,S02 and HC1, preferably less than 10 ppm. The resulting products were white or light tan. EXAMPLE I 70 grams of high density polyethylene powder having a density of 0.952, a crystalline melting point of 134 C by differential scanning calorimetry, a melt index of 4.3 and a particle size of 125 250 microns was dry blended with 3 parts per hundred of polyethylene of sodium g alumina, particle size 0.42 microns distribution 9Q 0.26 0.53 microns placed in a 2 diameter glass fluid bed column provided with a heating jacket through which silicon oil was circulated. The fluid bed was connected to a cyclone and further to a caustic scrubber. The fluid bed was provided on the outside with a source of UV light having the main wave length at 356 nanometers. The powder was fluidized for 30 minutes by passing approximately 10 liters per minute of nitrogen during which time the oxygen was removed. A mixture of 13 liters per minute of chlorine having less than 100 ppm oxygen, 6 liters per minute of sulfur dioxide and 4 liters per minute of hydrogen chloride, both having less than 100 ppm oxygen was used as both fluidizing and reactive medium. The mixture was admitted into the reactor at room temperature. The temperature of the fluid bed increased rapidly and after 60 minutes was at 132 C. It was kept at 1390C for 23 additional minutes. This temperature was maintained by proper cooling and or by temporary change of chlorine to sulfur dioxide ratio. The reaction was stopped at 83 minutes.The course of the reaction was followed by the density of powder samples extracted from the bed. Excellent axial mixing in the fluid bed and no deposits on the reactor walls was observed during the reaction. The final product was white and contained 35 chlorine and 1.1 sulfur as sulfonyl chloride group . It was completely soluble in toluene at 50 C, except the inorganic additive and it has a residual crystallinity below 3 . The polymer had a Mooney value ML 1 4 commat 1000CASTM No. D1646 of 90. EXAMPLE II 500 grams of linear low density polyethylene powder having density of 0.934, a crystalline melting point of 1250C differential scanning calorimetry , a melt index of 5 and a particle size of 162 420 microns was dry blended with 15 grams of sodium g alumina, particle size 0.42 micron and 1.25 gram of calcium stearate, and placed into a 4 diameter glass fluid bed column provided with means to introduce or take out heat in the form of vertical tubes through which water or steam was circulated. The fluid bed was connected to a cyclone and further to a caustic scrubber. The fluid bed was provided on the outside with a source of ultraviolet light having the main wavelength at 356 nanometers.The powder was fluidized for 60 minutes by passing approximately 28.3 liters per minute of nitrogen during which time the oxygen was removed. A mixture of 157 grams per minute of chlorine having less than 100 ppm of oxygen and 36.5 grams per minute of hydrogen chloride having less than 100 ppm of oxygen was used as both fluidizing and reactive medium. The mixture was admitted in the reactor at room temperature. The temperature of the fluidized powder increased within 4 minutes to 700C and after 15 minutes heat was provided to the reactor so that in 30 minutes the temperature of the fluid bed was 1150C. Sulfur dioxide containing less than 100 ppm of oxygen was added to the initial gas mixture at the rate of 100 grams per minute. After 38 minutes the temperature was increased to 1300C and after 5 minutes the reaction was stopped.The course of the reaction was followed by the density of powder samples withdrawn from the reactor. The final product was white and contained 32.8 percent chlorine and 1.2 percent sulfur. It had a residual crystallinity of 5.8 . The polymer had a Mooney value of 70 ML 1 4 at 1000C ASTM No. D1646 . It was completely soluble in toluene at 500C. A pressed sheet was clear and color free. During the entire reaction the fluid bed showed excellent axial mixing with no deposits on the reactor wall and very good heat transfer to the cooling heating tubes. Samples of the chlorosulfonated polyethylene of the Examples are readily vulcanized when compounded in a recipe containing 100 weight parts of the chlorosulfonated polyethylene, 100 weight parts of a mixture of equal parts of clay, calcium carbonate and titanium dioxide, 20 weight parts of polyester plasticizer, 4 weight parts of magnesium oxide, 3 weight parts of pentaerythritol, 1 weight part of 2,2 benzothiazyl disulfide, 1.5 weight parts of dipentamethylene thiuram hexasuldife and 1 weight part of carbowax polyethylene glycol 400, formed into standard tensile sheets and cured for 3 minutes at 397OF. The improved chlorosulfonated polyolefins of this invention find many uses and applications that take advantage of the resistance to ozone, ultraviolet light, and resistance to deterioration by heat, chemicals and solvents. Major uses are as vulcanizates in automotive applications, wire covering, hose, tubing, and sheet goods. More specific applications include coated fabrics, ozone proof coatings for elastomeric articles, belts, calendared fabric coatings, wire and cable covers, hose, molded goods, tank linings, pond and pit liners, roofing film, gaskets and the like.
