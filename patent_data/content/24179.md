# Electrical heating element and process for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
An electrical heating element material of a sheet form is provided, wich is comprised of a web of a synthetic resin 3 having a plurality of metal conductor wires 2 arranged therein in parallel to one another along the longitudinal direc tion of the web. The web is folded in succession at predeter mined intervals along folding lines 13 inclined at an acute angle to the transverse direction of the web to form a two layer rectangular sheet. The electrical heating element mater ial is prepared by supplying a plurality of metal conductor wires arranged in parallel to one another into a cross head type extrusion die, separately supplying a thermoplastic resin into said die, co extruding the resin together with the wires to form a web, folding the web in succession at predetermined intervals along folding lines inclined at an acute angle to the transverse direction of the web to form a two layer rectangu lar sheet, and then, optionally, bonding together the two layers. The electrical heating element material may be used as heat shrinkable cover, which is comprised of a heat shrinkable synthetic resin member and the electrical heating element material combined with the heat shrinkable resin member substantially over the entire region thereof.
