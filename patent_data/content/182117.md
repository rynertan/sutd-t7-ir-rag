## Description
ANTICOCCIDIAL COMPOSITIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compositions containing subtherapeutic doses of maduramicin and nicarbazin which synergistically control and or prevent coccidiosis in poultry. Both maduramicin and nicarbazin have been reported as effective anticoccidial agents. For instance, nicarbazin has been used as an anticoccidial but has been reported as inhibiting growth German Patent 2,154,049 .As such, attempts to alleviate the negative aspects of nicarbazin use such as growth inhibition or other safety concerns, have been and continue to be pursued. Therefore, combinations utilizing nicarbazin with other therapeutic compounds have been developed. For instance, combinations of nicarbazin with guanidines are disclosed in GermanPatent 2,154,049 as well as purines formulated with monensin and nicarbazin being disclosed in U.K. Patent 1,463,519 further, metichorpindol in combination with 4hydroxyquinolines is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,761,594. Maduramicin, on the other hand, is a new antibiotic that has been shown to be an effective anticoccidial agent U.S. Patent 4,278,663 U.S. Patent 4,368,265 and U.S.Patent 4,407,946 . Although combinations of nicarbazin with polyether antibiotics are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,218,438 and Reexamined U.S. Patent B4,218,438, compositions containing maduramicin and nicarbazin at extremely low subtherapeutic doses for effective control of coc cidiosis in poultry have not been disclosed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention unexpectedly has been found to synergistically control and or prevent coccidiosis in poultry by combining the relatively new anticoccidial agent, maduramicin, with nicarbazin. Not only that, but the present invention also relates to a method for preventing and or controlling said disease by orally administrating maduramicin and nicarbazin to poultry in compositions which synergistically control said coccidiosis. It is an object of this invention, therefore, to provide a method whereby coccidiosis is controlled and or prevented in poultry by utilizing compositions containing maduramicin and nicarbazin. It is a further object of the present invention to provide such compositions wherein said drugs are present in previously considered subtherapeutic doses and wherein said drugs synergistically control and or prevent coccidiosis. These and further objects will become more apparent by the following more detailed description of the invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compositions useful in the present invention contain both components at subtherapeutic doses. By subtherapeutic is meant a dose which is less than that normally required in therapeutic effect when the component is used alone or as usually combined with a polyether antibiotic or nicarbazin. The dose according to the invention is, of course, therapeutic. For instance, maduramicin is usually orally administered to poultry at doses of about 5 ppm or more. However, in the present feedstuff compositions, doses as low as 1.00 ppm are useful in controlling coccidiosis in poultry. Thus, maduramicin is present at levels of 1.00 ppm to 8.00 ppm, preferably 1.25 ppm to 5.00 ppm, and most preferred 2.50 ppm to 5.00 ppm. Likewise, nicarbazin s usual dose level, when orally administered in feedstuff compositions to poultry, is 125 ppm. Animal feed stuff compositions of the present invention contain nicarbazin at levels of 1.5 to 125 ppm, preferably 1.5 to 50 ppm, and most preferred 1.5 ppm to 25 ppm. Therefore, combination dosages of therapeutic agents present in animal feedstuff compositions of the present invention contain as little as 2.50 ppm to 130 ppm, preferably 3.75 ppm to 55 ppm, most preferred 4.00 ppm to 30 ppm drugs, whereas other compositions containing nicarbazin with polyether antibiotics contain 40 ppm to 245 ppm of total drugs. Thus, the combination dose of the present invention is subtherapeutic to those of other compositions. These levels of maduramicin and nicarbazin demonstrate significant control of coccidiosis caused by strains of Eimeria, as evidenced by increased survival of chickens and decreased lesion scores. Further, no adverse effects on weight gain are observed in the treated birds. Animal feedstuff compositions containing the therapeutic and or prophylactic levels of maduramicin and nicarbazin may be readily prepared by admixing these drugs with the feedstuff directly or by admixing a premix containing one or both of the drugs with the desired feedstuff. Poultry feedstuffs of all types and formulae normally used in the poultry industry are appropriate for use in the present invention. The following provide examples of such formulae.

EXAMPLE 1Preparation of a premix composition of maduramicin The ammonium salt of maduramicin 55 g, 1.1 on a weight basis is dissolved in 385 g, 7.7 on a weight basis of benzyl alcohol, thereby forming a murky suspension.This suspension is fed in a fine stream into a ribbon blender one cubic foot capacity holding 4,460 g, 89.2 on a weight basis of granular corncob Grit O Cob and is followed by the addition of 100 g, 2.0 on a weight basis, oil as a rinse of the container. The mixture is allowed to blend until uniform, about ten minutes, and a free flowing dry granular product results. EXAMPLE 2Preparation of medicated poultry feed containing nicarbazin and maduramicin Sufficient quantities of a 1 by weight maduramicin premix and 25 commercially available nicarbazin premix containing wheat middlings and soybean oil are admixed until homogeneous with a poultry diet containing the ingredients listed in Table I below, to provide medicated feed compositions containing from 1.5 ppm to 125 ppm of nicarbazin and 1.25 ppm to 5 ppm of maduramicin. In these examples, when 5.0 ppm of maduramicin is preferred, 5 of a 1 maduramicin premix is mixed with nicarbazin in a feedstuff. Of course, this quantity changes according to the amount of drug used for testing. Likewise, when 125 ppm of nicarbazin are required, 0.05 of a 25 premix is utilized. Again, this percentage changes with the amount of nicarbazin used in testing.

The poultry diets prepared as in Example 2 are the ones utilized in this experiment. A sufficient number of oocysts of Eimeria tenella to produce 60 to 75 mortality in untreated controls were given to one day old chicks, by direct inoculation into the crops of all chicks. The chicks were given free access to feed and water during the entire test period. Two days before inoculation, medicated feed, with several levels of drug, was presented to the various groups of chicks. The chicks were weighed 3 days after inoculation. Then seven days after inoculation, the experiments were terminated, and the chicks were weighed, sacrificed and their intestinal tracts were examined for lesions. The results appear in Table II.
