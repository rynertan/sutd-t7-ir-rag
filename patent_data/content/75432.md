# DRAFTING ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A drafting arrangement including a collector means suit ably utilized for fasciated yarn spinning. The collector means in a shape of hollow shell is disposed between a preceding draft means such as a pair of front rollers and a post draft means such as a pair of aprons, in such a manner that a front surface of the collector confronts a rearward surface of the preceding draft means and, on the other hand, a rear surface of the col lector means confronts with a front surface of the post draft means with a predetermined clearance. By this construction, a concomitant air stream accompanied with a rotation of the draft means is effectively expelled out of the fiber passage and stable drafting can be expected.
