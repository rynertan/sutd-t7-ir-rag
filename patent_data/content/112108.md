# RADIO SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A radio system employs a method of controlling the transmitted power of a radio signal such that a minimum power level for efficient reception is maintained. Data is simultaneously transmitted between two radio stations 10, 20 using an error correction code. Each block of the code is accompanied by a power bit. The transmitted power bit is set high or low in dependance upon whether the number of errors in a sample of received blocks, as determined by processing of the received code, is equal to, above or below a predetermined threshold value. At the other station the received power bit is directed to a power control device 18 and used to adjust the output power of the transmitter of that station by continuously variable slope delta demodulation.
