## Description
LOW FUEL CONSUMPTION TIRE WITH ALL WEATHER PERFORMANCES The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire, and more particularly, the invention relates to a low fuel consumption tire with all weather running performances in which particularly, wet skid resistance, rolling resistance, wear resistance and running performance on ice and snow road are remarkably improved. Since a styrene butadiene copolymer rubber SBR is excellent in wet skid resistance on wet road and wear resistance, this rubber has been heretofore used widely for the tread of the tires. However, such a rubber tread is difficult to be applied to a low fuel consumption tires because energy loss is large, heat is likely to be generated, and energy loss in rolling is large. Further, since the rubber hardening is conspicuous at a low temperature, the skid performance on the ice and snow road is deteriorated and the application of this rubber to the tire for use in the snow and ice road is not desirable. As the method of simultaneously improving the wet skid resistance, the heat generation, and the rolling resistance, Japanese Patent Application Laid OpenNo. 51,503 1982, Japanese Patent Application Laid OpenNo. 55,204 1982, and Japanese Patent ApplicationLaid Open No. 36,705 1982 disclose the use of styrenebutadiene rubber SBR in which the contents of bound styrene and vinyl bond are controlled. This SBR exhibits an excellent wet skid resistance and low fuel consumption, but the glass transition temperature Tg is high. Consequently, the rubber hardening is rapid and conspicuous at a low temperature and further the deterioration in the brittle fracture performance at a low temperature is observed, thereby resulting in the deteriorated skid performance on the snow and ice road. On the other hand, although there have been proposed various pneumatic tires suitable for the snow and ice roads, the performances thereof are not neces safely satisfactory, and still desired to be improved.In this connection, examination has been heretofore made on the material of the tread member to enhance the tread gripping force on the snow and ice roads.The techniques of reducing the hardness of rubber at low temperatures are well known from C.S. Wilkinson RCT, 27 255 1954 , F.S. Conant RCT 22 863 1949 and so on. For instance, as known from the literatures such as W.G. NÃ¶rich The Friction of Polymer on Ice Journal of the IRI, pp 192, October, 1972 , Desmond Moor The Friction of Pneumatic Tires 1975 and so on, when butadiene rubber BR , natural rubber NR , and or polyisoprene rubber IR is used as the tread rubber, the tread gripping force on the snow and ice road is improved. However, such methods unfavorably lower the tread gripping force on the wet roads.In order to mitigate the reduction in the tread gripping force, as known from the literatures such as A.C. Bassi RCT 381 965, D. Bulgin, G.D. Hubberd, M.H. Walters Proc. 4th Rubber Tech. Conf. London 193 1962 and so on, there has been known a method of using a large amount of styrene butadiene copolymer rubber, butyl rubber or carbon black. However, such a method unfavorably lowers the snow and ice performances and increases the rolling resistance. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a low fuel consumption tire which.is free from the above mentioned problems encountered by the prior art tires. More particularly, the object of the present invention is to provide a low fuel consumption tire with all weather running performances which possesses low fuel consumption performance, wet skid resistance performance, snow ice road running performances as mainly required by the radial tires, and particularly, the radial tires for the passenger cars. According to the present invention, there is a provision of a low fuel consumption tire with all weather running performances which uses as a tread a vulcanizable rubber composition in which into 100 parts by weight of a rubber component consisting of 100 to 25 parts by weight of at least one kind of diene rubber containing 0 to 30 of styrene and 25 to 95 of vinyl bond in a butadiene unit, and 0 to 70 parts by weight of at least one different kind of diene rubber from the above one is added 30 to 80 parts by weight of carbon black having iodine adsorption value AI of not less than 70 mg g, and dibutylphthalate DBP absorption of not less than 90 me 100 g, and 0.2 to 10 parts by weight of at least one kind of nitroso compound selected from the group consisting of a nitrosoquinoline compound represented by the following formula EMI4.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 denote the same or different substituents selected from a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and an alkyl group and a nitrosoaniline compound represented by the following formula EMI4.2 wherein R7 and R8 denote the same or different substituents selected from a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, and a phenyl group. These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be well appreciated upon reading of the following description of the invention when taken in connection with the attached drawings with understanding that some modifications, variations and changes of the same could be easily made by the skilled in the art to which the invention pertains without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of claims appended hereto. For the better understanding of the invention, reference is made to the attached drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a graph showing the relationship between OOC tan 6 and 600C tan 6 in rubber compositions in Examples and Fig. 2 is a graph showing the relationship between OOC tan 6 and 200C E in the rubber compositions in Examples. During the course of having made various studies so as to accomplish the above object, the present inventors have noted that there is disclosed inJapanese Patent Publication No. 38,131 1975, BritishPatent No. 1,185,896 and so on that the rubber compositions into which a nitrosoquinoline compound, or nitrosoaniline compound is added as a reactive antioxidant and that such nitroso compounds improve the resilience and also have a chipping prevention effect, and have made investigations to mainly improve the heat generation.Consequently, the present inventors have found that not only the heat generation property and the low fuel consumption performance of the rubber composition but also the low temperature brittleness performance can be improved by combining a diene rubber, carbon black and nitroso compound which meet specified requirements, and that the low fuel consumption tire with all weather running performance which satisfies the wet skid resistance, low rolling resistance, snow ice road running performance, wear resistance and so forth can be obtained by using this rubber composition as a tread member. As a result, the inventors have accomplished the invention. The pneumatic tire according to the present invention is characterized in that a tread is constituted by a vulcanizable rubber composition in which specified carbon black and a nitroso compound are added into a raw rubber satisfying specified requirements. As a raw rubber, use may be made of at least one kind of a diene rubber hereinafter referred to as diene rubber A alone containing 0 to 30 of styrene and 25 to 956 of vinyl bond in a butadiene unit, or a blend of not less than 25 parts by weight of the diene rubber A and not more than 75 parts by weight of at least one kind of a different diene rubber hereinafter referred to as diene rubber B natural rubber NR , polyisoprene rubber IR , polybutadiene rubber BR , styrenebutadiene copolymer rubber SBR different from the diene rubber A.If the content of styrene is 0 or the vinyl bond is less than 25 in the diene rubber A, the wet skid resistance is unfavorably lowered, while if the content of styrene is more than 30 and the vinyl bond is more than 95 , the rolling resistance and the snow ice road running performances are unfavorably deteriorated, respectively. When the blend of the diene rubber A and the different diene rubber B is used, if the diene rubber A is less than 25 parts by weight, the wet skid resistance and the rolling resistance are unfavorably deteriorated. The relation between the content of the bound styrene and the content of the vinyl bond of the diene rubber A is a factor which largely contributes to the wet skid resistance, the rolling resistance and the snow ice road running performances. Among them, the content of the styrene more largely contributes thereto.The content of the styrene is represented by weight relative to the whole diene rubber A, and therefore can be independently considered. But, as the content of the bound styrene varies, the content of butadiene does. Since the content of the vinyl bond 1,2 bond is represented by the weight in the butadiene unit, it is apparently influenced by the content of the bound styrene. For this reason, the conditions under which the wet skid resistance and the rolling resistance are satisfied can be represented by the content of the bound styrene and the content of the vinyl bond as a function of the content of the bound styrene.As a result of the investigation, in the case of the diene rubber A in which the content of the bound styrene is O to 30 by weight, and the content of vinyl bond in that of the butadiene unit is 25 to 95 by weight, it was proved that the conditions can be approximated in the following formula 45 I.7xstyrene content weight vinyl bond content weight 120 That is, if the above range is met, the wet skid resistance, the rolling resistance and the snow ice road running performances can be simultaneously satisfied when the nitroso compound is added as mentioned above. If the value is less than 45, unfavorably the wet skid resistance is lowered, and can no longer be improved even if the blending factors such as combined use of carbon black, oil and the different diene rubber B are changed. If the value exceeds 120, unfavorably the rolling resistance can in its turn no longer be improved even when other factors are changed. The above recited approximate formula is preferably 651.7xstyrene content weight vinyl bond content weight 6 120 When the value of 1.7xstyrene content weight vinyl bond content weight is set higher within the above range, the performances can be preferably well balanced by setting the combined use ratio of the nitroso compound higher. As the diene rubber A, it is preferable to use 100 to 40 parts by weight of the diene rubber A containing 0 to 30 of styrene and 25 to 70 of vinyl bond, preferably 5 to 25 of styrene and 35 to 70 of vinyl bond, more preferably 10 to 25 of styrene and 45 to 70 of vinyl bond. When the ratio of the vinyl bond is smaller, the wet skid resistance is insufficient.Even when 100 parts by weight of the diene rubber A is used, the wet skid resistance is insufficient. As the content of styrene and vinyl bond are increased, the combined use with other diene rubber is possible, but it is preferable to use up to 40 parts by weight of the diene rubber A. The nitroso compound to be added to the above raw rubber according to the present invention includes a nitrosoquinoline compound represented by the following formula EMI9.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R8 denote the same or different substituents selected from a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, and an alkyl group and a nitroso aniline compound represented by the following formula EMI10.1 wherein R7 and R8 denote the same or different substituents selected from a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, and a phenyl group. The above compounds are added to improve the tread gripping force on the snow and ice road and the rolling resistance, and the addition amount thereof is 0.2 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.2 to 5 parts by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight of the raw rubber.If the addition amount is less than 0.2 part by weight, effects of improving the snow and ice road running performances and the rolling resistance are insufficient, while if it exceeds 10 parts by weight, the wear resistance is unfavorably deteriorated. As the nitrosoquinoline compound represented by the above formula 1 , mention may be preferably made of nitrosohydroxyquinoline such as 5 nitrosohydroxyquinoline, 7 nitroso 8 hydroxy 5 methylquinoline, 5 nitroso 8 hydroxy 6 methylquinoline, 8 nitroso 5hydroxy 6 methylquinoline, 5 nitroso 8 hydroxy 7 methylquinoline, 6 nitroso 5 hydroxy 8 methylquinoline.Among them, 5 nitroso 8 hydroxyquinoline is most preferred. As the nitrosoaniline compounds represented by the above formula 2 , mention may be preferably made of N,N dimethyl nitrosoaniline and nitrosodiphenylamine. It is surprising that not only the rolling resistance but also the snow and ice performances are enhanced by adding the nitroso compound into the rubber composition. The carbon black to be added to the above raw rubber in the present invention has an iodine adsorption value IA of not less than 70 mg g and a dibutylphthalate DBP absorption of not less than 90 my 100 g.If the IA is less than 70 mg g or DBP absorption is less than 90 my 100 g, the wear resistance is unfavorably lowered. Among them, it is preferable to use carbon black with IA of 70 mg g to 130 mg g and DBP absorption of not less than 110 my 100 g. If IA exceeds 130 my 100 g, the rolling resistance is deteriorated. On the other hand, particularly when DBP absorption exceeds 110 me 100 g, remarkable result in enhancing the snow and ice performance at the addition of the nitroso compound can be obtained to show remarkable effects, Particularly, when the IA is 70 to 110 mg g and the DBP absorption is in a range of 110 mg g to 150 mg g, it was confirmed that excellent results are obtained with respect to the rolling resistance, the wear resistance and the snow and ice road running performance. Carbon black is compounded in a range of 30 80 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the raw rubber. If carbon black is less than 30 parts by weight, the wear resistance is lowered, while if the content is over 80 parts by weight, the rolling resistance and the snow ice road running performances are unfavorably deteriorated. Further, compounding agent ordinarily used in the rubber composition, such as vulcanizer, accelerator, activator, and antioxidant and so on may be appropriately compounded into the above mentioned rubber composition. The object of the present invention can be accomplished by forming the tread with the aboveconstituted rubber composition. It is important in controlling the snow ice performances under various circumstances that 200C E is not more than 280 kg cm2, preferably not more than 250 kg cm2, OOC E is not more than 190 kg cm2, and preferably 150 kg cm2, and it is also important in controlling and maintaining the snow ice performances over various circumstances that the change in E is small in such a temperature range. is a storage modulus Favorably, in order to control the wet skid performances, the OOC loss tangent tan 6 is not less than 0.30, preferably not less than 0.33, and in order to control the rolling resistance, the 600C tan 6 is not more than 0.22, and preferably not more than 0.19. As a method of further reducing the rolling resistance without damaging the snow ice road running performances and the wet skid resistance, the above performances are favorably much more enhanced by introducing the cap tread rubber base tread rubber cap base structure. It is possible to use as a base tread rubber composition the composition used in the present invention which is varied in compounding ratio from the cap tread rubber. The present invention will be explained more in detail with reference to the following examples, which are given merely illustrative of the invention, but never interpreted to limit the scope thereof.Examples Twenty two kinds of rubber compositions constituted at the respective compounding recipes parts by weight shown in Table 1 were prepared.Before the tire evaluation, E at 200C and OOC and tan 6 at OOC and 600C were measured by means of a spectrometer, and the Lambourn abrasion was evaluated in the following manner and are shown in Fig. 1, too.Next, eight kinds of the rubber compositions were selected among the above mentioned ones, and eight kinds of tires each having a tire size of 165 SR 13 and a tread constituted therefrom were built. Thereafter, with respect to the respective tires, the tread gripping force on the snow ice road and the tread gripping force on the wet road brakability , the wear resistance, and the rolling resistance were evaluated on an actual car in the following method. Results obtained are shown in Table 2.Evaluation methods 1 Road gripping force on snow and ice road A brake was trod during running at a speed of 20, 30 or 40 km h, and stopping distance was measured, the brakability was shown by index taking a value of a tire of Comparative Example 1 as 100. 2 Brakability A brake was rapidly trod on a wet asphalt road from a speed of 40 km h, 70 km h or 100 km h, and a running distance at which a vehicle was completely stopped was determined, and a determined value was shown by index taking a value of Comparative Example 1 as 100. The larger the figure, the better the brakability. 3 Rolling resistance While a load of 385 kg was applied onto a tire of an internal pressure of 1.7 kg cm2 on a steel drum of 1,707.6 mm in diameter and 350 mm in width, and the drum was rotated by driving a motor. After the tire was warmed up at a speed of 80 km h for 30 minutes, the speed was raised up to 200 km h. Then, a motor driving clutch was turn off, and the tire was let rolling. The rolling resistance between the tire and the drum at a speed of 50 km h was calculated on the basis of the drum deceleration speed and the lapse of time. The actual tire rolling resistance was determined by subtracting a preliminarily determined drum resistance from this value. The rolling resistance was shown by index taking a value of Control Example 1 as 100.The larger the figure, the better the rolling resistance 4 Wear resistance The Lambourn wear resistance of a rubber composition was evaluated in a laboratory in the following manner Vulcanization was carried out for a period 1.2 times as long as a period at which the torque of the rubber composition took the maximum value when measured by a rheometer. Then, the Lambourn abrasion was evaluated at a slip rate of 10 and under load of 4.5 kg, and shown by index taking a value of ComparativeExample 1 as 100. 5 Measruing ways of E and tan 6. By using a viscoelastic spectrometer made byIwamoto Seisakusho, the E and tan 6 were measured at a frequency of 50 Hz and a dynamic strain of 1 under a static elongation strain of 5 . A sample was shaped in a form of a strip having a length of 20 mm between chucks, a width of 5 mm and a thickness of 2 mm. The vulcanization conditions were the same as those in the above mentioned 4 .

Morero s method Chem. Ind. 41 758 1959 . In Table 1, Comparative Example 1 is an ordinary composition example for the treads of the snow tires, and Comparative Example 2 is an ordinary composition example for the treads of the summer tires. In Fig. 1 is shown the relation between OOC tan 6 and 600C tan 6 of the rubber composition inTable 1 and the relation between OOC tan 6 and 200C E is shown in Fig 2. Marks o and Q relate to the rubber composition of Examples and Comparative Examples respectively. The figures inside of the marks o and o show the numbers of Examples and ComparativeExamples respectively. The larger the figure of OOC tan 6, the higher the wet skid performance, and the smaller the figure of the 600C tan 6, the smaller the rolling resistance. The smaller the figure of 200C E , the more suitable for the snow ice road running the rubber composition. It is understood from Figs. 1 and 2 that the rubber compositions of Examples 1 13 are excellent in rolling resistance, wet skid performance and as tires for use in the snow ice road running.The relation shown in the figures shows substantially the same tendency on the tire evaluation, too.And, the performances proportional thereto were appeared. As mentioned above, since the tires according to the present invention has a tread formed with a rubber composition in which a specific carbon black and nitroso compound, as seen from Table 2, the tread gripping force on the snow and ice road and the rolling resistance are drastically improved without the tread gripping force on the wet road and the wear resistance being damaged. Thus, the rubber composition used in the present invention is extremely effective as the low fuel consumption tire for all the weather running purpose.
