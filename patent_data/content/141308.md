# An artificial light source device.

## Abstract
An artificial light source device in which the light rays from a light source lamp are converted to parallel light rays by means of a parabola reflection mirror and the parallel light rays are guided into an optical conductor rod and furthermore the output light rays from the optical rod are guided into an optical conductor cable and the output light rays from the optical conductor cable are employed as the light source. The light receiving edge of the optical conduc tor cable is inclined in relation to the direction of the light rays propagation. In addition to that, a filtering film capable of letting a pre selected light component pass through the light receiving edge surface and of reflecting other pre selected light components is provided thereon.
