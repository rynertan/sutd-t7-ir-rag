# Forged joints.

## Abstract
A method of forming a joint between two bars, 10 and 11 uses a tubular stub 12 of circular or square cross section to interconnect the bars. The bars 10 and 11 are positioned with their axes at the required relative disposition, and with the stub 12 therebetween, the stub axis intersecting the two bar axes 1 . The bars are then forced together 2 , until the stub is deformed sufficiently to surround partially the two bars 3 . The stub 12 may be heated initially, and the completed joint subjected to forced cooling, to take advan tage of the thermal contraction of the stub to enhance the strength of the connection. The method may be modified 4 7 to effect a T joint between a bar and a tubular member, in which case no separate stub need be used. Instead, two opposed regions and, of the end portion of the tubular member are deformed inwardly so as to form a groove across the end of the member, with ears and upstanding on each side of the groove. The bar is then pressed into the groove, until the ears and become formed partially around the bar 6 , so gripping the bar. Again, the tubular member may be heated so that the deformed member thermally contracts on to the bar.
