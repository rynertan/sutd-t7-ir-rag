# Recovery of coated aluminium scrap.

## Abstract
In a process for recovering aluminium from lacquer coated scrap a solution of a mixture of halide salts, which melts at a temperature of less than 710 C is applied to the scrap before the lacquer coating of the scrap is pyrolysed, preferably at a temperature of 400 500 C. The salt mix acts as a flux and the burnt off scrap yields a clean recovered metal relatively free from oxide inclusions. The preferred flux is a 50 50 mixture of sodium chloride and potassium chloride, with an optional addition of up to about 3 of an alkali metal fluoride.
