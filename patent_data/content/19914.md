# A method of forming yarn or a textile product.

## Abstract
A multifilament thermoplastic yarn and process for the formation thereof which, when tufted or woven into a fabric, presents a grass like appearance. The yarn is made by meltspinning 18, 20 and water quenching 24 , a meltspinnable synthetic organic thermoplastic polymer, such as polypropylene, drawing the filaments, surface heating at least a portion of the thus drawn filaments 30, 50 cooling the thus surface heated filaments and reheating the thus cooled filaments either before or after tufting, weaving or otherwise processing into a fabric to develop latent crimp in the yarn. Also disclosed is a carpet fabric employing the yarn and exhibiting grass like appearance with exceptional cover and relatively soft hand.
