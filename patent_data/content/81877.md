## Description
LH RH ANTAGONISTS This invention relates to novel peptides which are antagonist of the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone LH RH , which has the structure p Glu His Trp Ser Tyr Gly Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2. More specifically, this invention relates to luteinizing hormone releasing factor LH RH analogs, salts thereof, to processes and intermediates for preparing these analogs, and to pharmaceutical compositions pertaining to these analogs. The LH RH analogs of this invention differ in structure from LH RH by having the amino acid residues at positions 1, 2 and 6, and optionally at positions 3 and 10, replaced by other amino acid residues. For several years investigators have been searching for selective, potent antagonists of the LH RH decapeptide. See the review article byD.H. Coy and A.V. Schally, Annals of ClinicalResearch, 10, 139 1978 . The high degree of interest in such antagonists is due to their usefulness in the endocrine and cancer fields. A great number of compounds have been prepared as potential LH RH antagonist but most of these compounds lack potency or are mixed agonist and antagonist of the LH RH decapeptide. The most interesting antagonists to date have been compounds having a modified structure of LH RH. For instance, D Phe2 LH RH, R.A.W. Rees et al., J.Med.Chem., 17, 1016 1974 D Phe2 ,D Phe6 LH RH, D Phe2,Phe3, D Phe6 LH RH and D Phe2,D Trp3,D Phe6 LH RH, D.H. Coy et al., in Peptides 1976 , A.

For instance, the compounds of formula I find use as agents for relieving the complications from the undesirable physiological availability of pituitary gonadotropins in a mammal.Such complications include precocious puberty hormone dependent tumors such as malignant and benign prostatic tumors, and mammary, ovarian and testicular tumors hirsutism acne amenorrhea, e.g. secondary amenorrhea endometriosis, and ovarian and mammary cystic diseases in both animals and humans. The compounds of formula I also are useful for regulating ovulation, thus rendering them useful agents for controlling fertility, e.g. as precoital or postcoital contraceptives, for synchronizing estrus in livestock and for improving the rhythm method. Also, the compounds are useful for regulating the human menopausal gonadotropin, follicle stimulating hormone FSH and luteinizing hormone LH during perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods in women. When the compound of formula I, preferably in the form of an acid addition salt, is employed in human or veterinary medicine, it is administered systemically, either orally or by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, or by sublingual, nasal, or vaginal administration, in compositions in conjunction with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or carrier. The daily dosage of the compounds of formula I will vary with the form of administration and with the particular patient under treatment. Generally, treatment is initiated with small dosages substantially less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. In general, the compound obtained by the process is most desirably administered at a concentration level that generally will inhibit release of LH and of FSH without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects, and preferably at a level that is in a range of from 1 mcg to about 1000 mcg per kilogram bodyweight for parenteral administration and from 0.5 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram bodyweight for enteral administration.However, a dosage level for parenteral administration that is in the range of from 2.5 mcg to about 250 mcg and for enteral administration of from 1 mg to 25 mg is most desirably employed in order to achieve effective results. For administration by the nasal route as drops or spray it is preferred to use the compound of formula I in solution in a sterile aqueous vehicle which may also contain other sclutes such as buffers or preservatives, as well as sufficient quantities of pharmaceutically acceptable salts or of glucose to make the solution isotonic. Doses by the intranasal route range from 100 mcg to 10.0 mgfkg, or preferably 100 mcg to 1.0 mg kg of body weight. The compound of formula I also may be administered as nasal or vaginal powders or insufflations. For such purposes the decapeptide is administered in finely divided solid form together with a pharmaceutically acceptable solid carrier for example, a finely divided polyethylene glycol for in stance the polyethylene glycol sold under the trade mark Carbowax 1540 finely divided lactose or preferably for vaginal administration, very finely divided silica, for instance, the silica sold under the trade mark Cab O Sil . Such compositions may also contain other excipients in finely divided solid form such as preservatives, buffers, or surface active agents. For sublingual or vaginal administration, the compound is formulated preferably in solid dosage forms such as sublìngua1 tablets or vaginal inserts or suppositories with sufficient antities of solid excipients such as starch, lactose, certain types of clay, buffers, and lubricating, disinteqrating, or surface active agente, or with semi solid recipient used In the formulation ot suppositories,Examples of such excipients are found in standard pharmaceutical texts, e.q. in Remington sPharmaceutical Sciences, Mack PublishingCompany, Easton. Pa.. 1970. it is often desirable to administer the compounds of formula I continuously over prolonged periods of time in long acting, slow release, or depot dosage forms. Such dosage forms may either contain a pharmaceuti call acceptable salt of the compound having d low degree of solbllity in body fluids fo example one of those salts described below they may contain the compound in the form nf a water soluble salt together with a protective carrier which prevent rapid release.In the latter case, for example, the compound may he formulated with a non anitcenic partially hydrolyzed gelatin in the for of a viscous liquid or it may be adsorbed on a pharmaceutl cally acceptable solid carrier tor example Inc hydroxide, and may be administered in suspension in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid vehicle or the decapeptide may be formulated in gel or suspensions with a protective non entigenic hydrocolloid, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium alginate, gelatine polygalacturonic acids1 for example, pectin, or certain mucopolyvsaccharides, together with aqueous or non aqueous pharmaceutically acceptable liquid vehicles, preservatives, or surfactants. Examples of such formulations re found in standard pharmaceutical texts, e , in Pharmaceutical Sciences, cited above Long acting, slow release preparations of the compound may amino be obtained by micro encapsulation in a pharmaceutically acceptable coating material, for example gelatine, polyvinyl alcohol or ethyl cellulose.Further examples of coating materials and of the processes used for microencapsulation are described by J.A. Herbig in Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology , Vol.13, 2nd ed., Wiley, New York, 1967, pp. 436 456. Such formulations, as well as suspensions of salts of the compound which are only sparinqly soluble in body fluids, are designed to release from about 1 1000 mcg of the compound per kilogram body weight per day, and are preferably administered by intramuscular injection. Alternatively, some of the solid dosage forms listed above, for example certain sparingly water soluble salts or dispersions in or adsorbates on solid carriers of salts of the compound, for example dispersions in a neutral hydrogel of a polymer of ethylene glycol methacrylate or similar monomers, crosslinked as described in U.S. Patent 3,551,556, issued December 29, 1970 to K.Kliment, et al., may also be formulated in the form of pellets releasing about the same amounts as shown above and may be implanted subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Alternatively, slow release effects over prolonged periods of time may also be obtained by administering the compound obtained by the process of this invention in an intra vaginal device or in a temporary implant, for example a container made of a non irritating silicone polymer such as polysiloxane, a suitable polysiloxane is sold under the trade mark Silastic , or of a neutral hydrogel of a polymer as described above, possessing the required degree of permcability to release from about 0.1 mcg to about 50 mcg per kilogram body weight per day.Such intravaginal or implant dosage forms for prolonged administration have the advantage that they may be removed when it is desired to interrupt or to terminate treatment.Chemical synthesis In selecting a particular side chain protective group to be used in the synthesis of the present decapeptides, the following rules should be followed a the protective group must be stable to the reagent and under the reaction conditions selected for removing the a amino protective group at each step of the synthesis, b the protective group must retain its protecting properties i.e., not be split off under coupling conditions , and c the side chain protective group must be removable upon the completion of the synthesis of the peptide containing the desired amino acid sequence under reaction conditions that will not alter the peptide chain. With reference to a amino protective groups, for instance K , suitable protective groups include Cl aliphatic urethan protective groups illustrated by t butyloxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, biphenylisopropyloxycarbonyl, isopropyloxycarbonyl, t amyloxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl and allyloxycarbonyl 2 cycloalkyl urethan type protective groups illustrated by cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl, d isobornyloxycarbonyl and cyclohexyloxycarbonyl and nitrophenylsulfenyl a,a dimethyl 3,5 dimethoxy benzyloxycarbonyl and trityl.The preferred a amino protective groups are selected from the group consisting of t butyloxycarbonyl, cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, t amyloxycarbonyl, d isobornyloxycarbonyl, o nitrophenylsulfenyl, biphenylisopropyloxycarbonyl, and a, a dimethyl 3,5 dimethoxybenzyloxycarbonyl. Using solid phase techniques the synthesis is commenced from the C terminal end of the peptide using an a amino protected amino acid linked to a solid resin. Such a starting material is prepared for example, by attaching an a amino protected glycine to a benzhydrylamine resin, a chloromethylated resin or a hydroxymethyl resin, the former being preferred. The preparation of a benzhydrylamine resin is described byP. Rivaille, et also, Helv.Chim.Acta., 54, 2772 1971 and the preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is described by M. Bodanszky andJ.T. Sheehan, Chem.Ind. London , 38, 1597 1966 .A chloromethylated resin is commercially avaiable from Bio Rad Laboratories, Richmond, California.In using the benzhydrylamine resin, an amide anchoring bond is formed with the a amino protected glycine or D alanine, illustrated as follows for glycine EMI21.1 This permits the C terminal amide function to be obtained directly after the amino acid sequence in the synthesis is completed by cleaving off the resin support and anchoring radical of the linked peptide to form the amino acid amide at the C terminal portion of the desired compound. In this instance the use of hydrogen fluoride for cleaving off the resin support also removes the side chain protective groups to give the decapeptide of this invention. When the other resins are used, the anchoring bond is the benzylester group as illustrated hereinbefore. In this instance a convenient procedure for converting the linked protected peptide to the C terminal amide is to ammonolize the protected peptide off the resin and then remove the protective groups of the resulting amide by treatment with sodium in liquid ammonia or by the hydrogen fluoride cleavage. An alternative procedure would be to cleave by transesterification with a lower alkanol, preferably methanol or ethanol, in the presence of triethylamine and then convert the resulting ester into an amide and subsequently deprotect as described above. See alsoJ.M. Steward and J.D. Young, Solid PhasePeptide Synthesis , W.H. Freeman Co., SanFrancisco, 1969, pp. 40 49. More specifically, in an embodiment of the present invention, an a amino protected amino acid namely, an a amino protected glycine, preferably t butyloxycarbonylglycine or an a amino protected D alanine, preferably t butyloxycarbonyl D alanine is coupled to the benzhydrylamine resin with the aid of a carboxy group activating compound, preferably, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide or diisopropylcarbodiimide.Following the coupling of the a amino protected amino acid to the resin support, the a amino protecting group is removed such as by using trifluoroacetic acid in methylene chloride, trifluoroacetic acid alone or hydrochloric acid in dioxane. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0 OC and room temperature i.e. 20 to 24 OC . Other standard cleaving reagents and conditions for removal of specific a amino protecting groups may be used as described by E. Schroder and K. Lubke, The Peptides , Vol. I, Academic Press, New York, 1965, pp. 72 75. After removal of the a amino protecting group, the remaining a amino protected amino acids are coupled step wise in the desired order to obtain the peptide.Each protected amino acid is introduced into the solid phase reactor in about a three fold excess and the coupling is carried out in a medium of methylene chloride or mixtures of dimethyl formamide in methylene chloride. In cases where incomplete coupling occurred, the coupling procedure is repeated before removal of the a amino protecting group, prior to the coupling of the next amino acid to the solid phase reactor. The success of the coupling reaction at each stage of the synthesis is monitored by the ninhydrin reaction as described by E. Kaiser, et al., Analyt. Biochem., 34, 595 1970 . In this manner the compounds of formula II in which X is hydrogen is obtained. After the desired amino acid sequence has been synthesized, the peptide is removed from the resin support by treatment with a reagent such as hydrogen fluoride which not only cleaves the peptide from the resin but also cleaves all remaining side chain protecting groups to obtain directly the peptide of formula I wherein X is hydrogen in the case where the benzhydrylamine resin was used. Where a benzylester resin is used the peptide may be separated from the resin by transesterification with a lower alkanol, preferably methanol or ethanol, after which the recovered product is chromatographed on silica gel and the collected fraction subjected to treatment with ammonia to convert the lower alkyl ester, preferably the methyl or ethyl ester, to theC terminal amide. In this manner the compounds of formula III in which X is hydrogen are obtained. The side chain protecting groups are then cleaved by procedures described above, for example by treatment with sodium in liquid ammonia or by hydrogen fluoride to give the corresponding compound of formula I wherein X is hydrogen. The peptide compounds of formula I in which X is other than hydrogen are preferably obtained by acylation of the corresponding compound of formula II or III in which X is hydrogen with the appropriate acylating agent, followed by cleaving the resin support together with the anchoring radical, and all the remaining side chain protecting groups of the acylated product by the procedures described above. Preferably, a lower alkanoic acid chloride or bromide or lower alkanoic anhydride in the presence of an organic proton acceptor, e.g.pyridine or imidazole, is used as the acylating agent to prepare the compounds of formula II orIII in which X is lower alkanoyl. Likewise, in the presence of an organic proton acceptor, compounds of formula II or III in which X is HOOC CHp n CO are prepared using the acid chloride or acid bromide corresponding to the desired acyl radical X, e.g. succinyl chloride can be used for preparing compounds of formula II or III in which X is HOOCCH2CH2CO. The compound of formula II or III in which X is the acyl portion or N acylated acyl portion of a D or Lamino acid are prepared conveniently by the activated ester coupling procedure. Accordingly, the amino acid corresponding to the desired acyl portion to be incorporated into the compound of formula II or III is converted into an activated ester.Descriptions of such carboxyl activating groups are found in general textbooks of peptide chemistry for example K.D. Kopple, Peptides andAmino Acids W.A. Benjamin, Inc., New York, 1966, pp. 45 51, and E. Schröder and K. Lubke, The Peptides Vol. I, Academic Press, New York, 1965, pp. 77 128. Examples of the activated form of the terminal carboxyl are acid chloride, anhydride, azide, activated ester, or O acyl urea of a dialkylcarbodiimide. The following activated esters have proved to be particularly suitable in the process of this invention 2,4,5 trichlorophenyl represented by Tcp , pentachlorophenyl represented by Pep , p nitrophenyl represented by Np the l benzotriazolyl group represented by Bt or the succinimido group is also useful for such activation. The peptide compounds of formula I in which X is hydrogen also are useful for preparing the compounds of formula I in which X is other than hydrogen by subjectinq the former compound to the appropriate acylating agent. Although a solid phase synthesis of the compound of formula I is disclosed herein in detail, the preparation of the peptide also can be realized by classical solution methods well known and described in detail in all textbooks, dealing with peptide chemistry.
