## Description
EXTERIOR SURFACE OF BUILDINGS This invention relates to exterior surfaces of buildings. It is known to apply a resin based layer to the exterior surface of a building. The resin may have incorporated in it a filler so that when the mixture is applied to the surface of the building and the resin hardens the appearance of this resin layer depends to some extent on the nature of the filler. However, the appearance still depends to a large extent on the resin itself giving the surface an unappealing glassy appearance. It has now been discovered that by the selection of sand as the filler, a composition can be produced which, when applied to a substrate, results in a surface finish which has no trace of the characteristic hardened resin appearance. According to the present invention there is provided a method of making an exterior wall for a building or part thereof, the method comprising applying to a substrate a layer of a composition comprising a hardenable liquid resin in admixture with sand in order to produce a surface finish simulating stone, brick or other natural or artificial finish. Preferably the substrate is in the form of a layer or mat of glass fibre which itself is applied to a more solid substrate such as chipboard or other support. More preferably the glass fibre is coated with resin before the resin sand mixture is applied. Preferably the sand is silica sand and the resin is a polyester resin which when mixed with a catalyst hardens in the usual way. If desired, one or more pigments may be added to the mixture in order to produce the desired colour shade. The sand resin mixture may be applied to the surface by means of, for instance, a brush, roller or a suitable spray gun. By way of examples, the following finishes can be obtained 1 a brick finish by using a mixture of approximately 60 by volume silica sand, together with resin and a small amount of an appropriate resin colouring pigment 2 a mortar finish, for use together with the brickwork finish in order to produce the pointing effect, may be produced by using a mixture containing approximately 15 by volume silica sand together with resin and resin colouring pigment 3 a stone finish may be produced using a mixture similar to that for brick but incorporating a different coloured pigment 4 a slate finish may be obtained by using a mixture of approximately 30 by volume silica sand, 30 by volume plaster, the balance being resin and a small amount of pigment 5 a pebble dash finish may be produced by using a mixture of approximately 40 by volume silica sand in admixture with resin and a small amount of pigment. The pebbles or chippings are applied to this finish before the resin hardens dnd the silica sand resin pigment mixture gives the realistic background appearance to the pebbles or chippings located thereon. In the case of examples l to 3 above the appearance is improved by applying further sand to the resin sand layer before the resin hardens. In this way the surface will have no trace of glassy resin appearance but has a most surprisingly realistic appearance of the finish which is being simulated. The underlying support structure for the finish may be, for instance, wood orfibre boardpanels. It may also be a structure based foamed polyurethane blocks. For instance, a wall or section of wall may be built up by means of foamed polyurethane blocks in iquid f loaded into a suitaie support such as a cardboard box. The latter acts simply as a former within which the polyurethane blocks are. located and onto which the fibre glass matt and exterior finish may be applied.Within the box internal partitions may be provided in order to give the structure the desired strength. Alternatively, or in addition, the polyurethane blocks may be encapsulated within a layered fibre a lass one or more shell, the layersoffibre glassbeing impregnated with least zone such resin. For added strength at resin impregnated layer may extend transversely between adjacent blocks as well as across the outer surface of any one particular block. The present invention is particularly, but not exclusively, applicable to prefabricated buildings. A method of constructing a prefabricated building in accordance with the present invention comprises the steps of joining together a plurality of wood or fibre board panels to define walls of the enclosure overlying adjacent surfaces of the panels with a continuous layer of fibre glass applying resin to the fibre glass layer and applying a finish to the resin coated fibre glass layer, the finish being formed from a mixture of hardenable liquid resin and sand. In order to obtain a brick or stone finish a first mortar simulating layer may be applied to the fibre glass layer. This mortar simulating layer may then be masked off to a desired pattern to form a grid defining features such as lines of pointing.A further layer is then applied over the masked off layer, the further layer comprising a mixture of synthetic resin and sand, containing a pigment to give the colouration of brick or stone.Before this further layer has fully set, the masking is removed so that the grid pattern will be revealed.This grid pattern will be recessed thereby further enhancing the realistic appearance of, for instance, lines of pointing. It will be appreciated that a prefabricated building panel can be made in the same way. Wood or fibre board panels may form four interconnected vertical walls of a rectangular enclosure, being mounted, for instance, on an angle iron frame.For smaller buildings the metal frame may be dispensed with, the walls being mounted on an angle iron base. It will be appreciated that the frame or base can be made of other materials, for instance alloy angles or members having, for instance, aU shaped section. A fibre glass web may be applied to the panels so as t9 extend over the joints therebetween and then the resin and resin and sand layers may be applied as mentioned above. In another application the panels may form the six inter connected sides of a cabinet, the fibre glass web extending over all twelve joints and the external surfaces of five of the sides being covered with a layer of synthetic resin and sand, stone chippings being applied to this layer before it is fully set. The interior surfaces of the cabinet or enclosure may be lined with a pre formed plastics laminate. Such a cabinet may be,. for instance, a housing for an electricity or gas meter. The wood or fibre board panels may be natural timber or may alternatively be of semi manufactured form such as blockboard, hardboard, plywood, chipboard or even suitably stiff cardboard or suitably resilient asbestos. In the case where the support for the exterior finish is in the form of blocks of polyurethane foam, then a structure may be made up into building modules which are used in much the same way as traditional inidividual bricks. On the other hand, the structure may be in the form of a panel to form the whole or a substantial part of the wall of a building or part thereof. A building or part of a building may be completed in the factory by joining together panels such as those described above. Alternatively the building may be transported from the factory to the purchaser in knock down form and then assembled by the purchaser, perhaps on a building site. In this case one of two panels to be connected together may be provided with integral kevs extending outwardly from the Panel edge which is to abut the adjacent panel. The adjacent panel1 have mating holes so that by aligning the panels and moving them together the keys can be inserted in the holes in order to make a connection between the two panels. Preferably the holes and the keys are shaped so that the keys have enlarged head portions and the holes, as they extend inwardly into the panel, are angled.The adjacent panels are initially moved towards each other out of alignment so that the enlarged head portions of the keys will enter the holes. The panels are then relatively displaced so as to bring them into alignment, and this action causes the head portions of the keys to slide within theangledholes and thus draw the panels together.Advantage can be taken of this action by locating on one or both surfaces to be butted together an amount of the resin sand mixture corresponding to the mixture applied to the facing surfaces of the panels. When the panels are drawn together by the above described action the resin sand mixture will be squeezed outwardly so as to overlie the top touching edges of the panels. Surplus resin sand mixture may then be removed and as a result there is no trace of the join between the panels. The present invention will now be described, by way of examples only, and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a portion of an enclosure built according to the invention, parts thereof being cut away for clarity Figure 2 shows a horizontal section of a portion of the enclosure shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 shows in perspective the completed enclosure Figure 4 shows to an enlarged scale part of the outwardly facing surface of the enclo sure Figure 5 shows in section part of the side of a house made in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention Figure 6 is a section through a panel formed from polyurethane blocks Figure 7 is a section through an alternative panel formed from poly rethane blocks and Figure 8 shows two panels with mating keys and holes. Referring tc Figures 1 to 3 of the drawings, a chipboard panel refining a wall 1 of an enclosure abuts on a second chipboard panel defining a wall 2 at right angles thereto. The xesultant joint 3 extends from the inside of the angle to an outwardly facinq vertical line 4. Each of the panels is grooved along its bottom edge and in the grooves 5 are located the vertical flanges of an angle iron frame which determines the shape of the enclosure. The joint 3 is both glued and screwed or alternatively rivetted.The panels may alternatively be butt jointed and rivetted to the angle iron frame. When the frane has been completed boarded out, the whole of the outside area is incapsulated with glass fibre matting coated with resin. This can be applied by hand or by machine. If it is desired to simulate brick or random stone or produce a similar finish, it is necessary at this stage to apply a second coat of resin but this time in admixture with sand and incorporating an appropriate pigment to obtain the colour of mortar, as described above. While the resin is still wet it is sprayed with dry sand to improve the appearance of the pointing finish. When the resin has hardened, strips of masking tape are laid in a predetermined pattern over the entire hardened outer surface. The pattern will be a rectangular grid pattern for brickwork or a more random pattern for random stonework. To the masked off surface a mixture of polyester resin and silica sand containing brick or stone colouring pigment is then applied as a layer 7 about n thick to each of the outer walls of the enclosure. Before the mixture has completely hardened, the masking tape is removed carefully. Figure 4 shows, to an enlarged scale, a simulated brick wall produced by the method described above.The simulated lines of pointing 12 are clearly visible where the masking tape was initially laid and the bricks 13 stand slightly proud for example from the pointing . The mortar layer and the brick layer can both have sand applied thereto before the resin sets to enhance the appearance. Finally individual bricks may be treated, for instance, by paint spraying in order to give an even more realistic appearance of bricks having slightly different colours or shades. The inside walls of the enclosure or building may be painted with resin to form a vapour barrier before paint or a stipple finish is applied. Referring to Figure 5, a two storey house may be constructed using modules A to I to form the walls of the house. These modules may be made from polyurethane blocks as mentioned above. Conventional foundations are first prepared and because the finished house will be relatively light in weight, the depth of concrete needed for the foundations will already constitute a saving on traditional construction methods. Each wall of the house is constructed by laying on top of one another. In an alternative embodiment the modules are in sheet form and they are laid side by side. As Figure 1 shows, each module is separated from its surrounding modules by a relatively small but constant gap on all faces. If all these gaps are sealed with masking tape as shown in Figure 1 at i for the exterior surface and k for the interior wall surface , the end gaps also being sealed, a suitable hardenable resin, matrix or similar mixture can be injected into the entire wall gap area. The mixture drives out the air from between successive modules, vents possibly being provided for this purpose. As soon as the resin has at least partly set, the masking tape is removed so that the mixture is revealed as simulated pointing inbetween successive modules.The mixture, when fully set, binds the modules firmly together and gives to the wall the necessary inherent rigidity. The pointing can then be masked off and a finish of resin sand pigment may be applied to give the desired appearance.Alternatively the finish m be apPlied before the e are assembled together In an alternatlve emDoaLment, u moaules fixed together by means of metal or plastics brackets using nuts and bolts or screws or rivets. As indicated in Figure 5, module A is recessed to take ground floor joists. Modules B are recessed along their bottom edges in order to incorporate pipework, cabling and ducting. Clip on skirting boards 21 are used to cover the cabling and ducting. In a similar way modules E and F are modified in order to accommodate the floor joists for the upper level and cabling and ducting. The internal walls of the house could be finished with pre formed panels or sheets.Alternatively they could be layered and trowelled with suitable mixtures to give desired decorative finishes. Alternatively the internal walls can be conventionally plastered and painted so that the entire building from within and without gives the appearance of a traditionally built house. In an alternative embodiment, a building formed from blocks having a core of polyurethane can have their exterior surfaces treated in just the same way as for the chipboard based structures Thus glass fibre matting can be applied first and then the resin sand mixtures as described above. Referring to Figure 6, a section through a panel having a core formed from polyurethane blocks or sheets is shown. The polyurethane blocks or sheets 31 are laid on top of a layer of glass fibre mat 33 with wooden formers 35 being placed between adjacent polyurethane blocks. A further layer of glass fibre matting 37 is laid over the assembly of polyurethane blocks 31 and formers 35. Resin is applied to the glass fibre matting and the resultant panel is a strong structure suitable for the wall of a building or part thereof. A resin sand mixture may be applied to one surface of this panel in the manner described above. If desired, the panel may be given extra strength by incorporating ties 39 extending between the glass fibre matting layers 33 and 37. These ties may be made of, for instance, wood, metal fibre glass and or resin.The ties will also act to prevent delamination of the fibre glass matting from the polyurethane block. Further layers of fibre glass matting may be applied, if desired. A strong panel may be as shown in Figure 7. The panel is in this case formed by locating polyurethane blocks 41 on top of a layer of fibre glass matting 43.A further layer of fibre glass matting 45 is then laid over the first layer 43 and over the blocks 41 so that this layer 45 takes up the shape illustrated inFigure 7. Further larger polurethane blocks 47 are then located between blocks 41 and over glass fibre layer 45. Finally the whole structure is overlaid with a further glass fibre layer 49, resin being applied before and or after to the layers 43 and 49.Because of the layer 45 extending not only longitudinally but transversely of the panel in the manner shown in Figure 7, this panel is very strong and is suitable for substantial size buildings, home extensions and the like. Referring to Figure 8, there is shown a method of joining together two panels in order to obtain a close join without the edges of the panel being seen. This is particulary suitable for knock down structures, in other words, in the case where the panels are to be made in the factory but then transported to the user in knock down form, the user then assembling the structure on site. Such knock down structures may be, for instance, storm porches, dormer windows and the like. Complete buildings may also be provided in this form. Two panels 51 and 53 are to be joined together.Panel 51 is provided with holes 55 in surface 57 which is to abut a corresponding surface on.panel 53. Holes 55 extend inwardly into panel 51 but in a direction away from side surface 59. Panel 53 is provided with lugs or keys 61. These lugs or keys are shaped so as to fit into holes 55.However, lugs or keys 61 are offset relative to the positions of holes 55. This is illustrated in Figure 8. The arrows showing the relative movement of the panels towards each other but slightly displaced so that the lugs will enter holes 55. When this happens the panels are then displaced laterally relative to each other so that the lugs 61 slide further into the holes 55 and the panels are drawn together. It will be seen that the relative force applied between the panels can be in a direction between the panels or laterally thereto. The result will be that the panels will come together and when the lugs 61 reach the end of holes 55 the panels will be longitudinally aligned. Resin sand mixture placed on say surface 57 will be squeezed onto the top faces 63 and 65 of the panels so as to overlie the abutting edges thereof. All that is then necessary is for surplus extruded resin sand mixture to be removed from this edge. The result will be that the panels will be joined together without any trace of the join being visible to the eye. While the Figure 8 embodiment relates to buttjointed panels, it will be appreciated that the jointing may be mitred or indeed any other form of jointing.
