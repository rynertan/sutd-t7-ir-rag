## Abstract
An input MOS transistor 22 receives an input voltage and produces a current corresponding to the input voltage. A charge discharge circuit 23 to 26 charges a capacitor 29 alternately in two different directions by the output current of the transistor 22 . A select circuit 30 alternately selects and produces one of the potentials at either of the electrodes of the capacitor 29 . A single two input com parator 31 compares a reference potential with a potential of the output signal of the select circuit 30 . The select circuit 32 produces a signal corresponding to the com parison result. The select circuit 32 allows the output sig nal of the comparator 31 to be transmitted alternately to the set input terminal and the reset input terminal of a flip flop 33 . The flip flop 33 is set and reset by the output signal of the switch means 32 to produce an oscillating signal. According to a change in the level of the oscillating signal, the charge discharge circuit 23 to 26 switches the charging direction of the capacitor 29 . According to a change in the voltage level of the output signal of the flip flop 33 , the select circuit 30 selects the potential which is higher in absolute value than the other. According to a change in the voltage level of this output signal, the switch circuit 32 directs the output signal of the comparator 31 to one of the set and reset input terminals of the flip flop 33 .
