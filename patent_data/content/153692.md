## Description
The present invention relates to a method for isomerizing a glycidate in the presence of a catalyst. There have been several reports on reagents for isomerizing glycidates. As reaction reagents for isomerization useful for the production of pyruvic acid derivatives, there have been known a an acid mixture of a lower fatty acid and a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid JP B 35069 1978 and JP A 149970 1978 , and b a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride or aluminum chloride, or a proton acid such as sulfuric acid or p toluenesulfonic acid JP A 99445 1981 . However, the method of using the reagent a has a drawback that substantial amounts of aldehydes are likely to be produced as by products due to decarboxylation, and the yield of the reaction is low. Whereas, the method of using the reagent b has a drawback that only corrosive sulfuric acid is practically useful as a catalyst, and in order to obtain a satisfactory yield with other members of the reagent, such members are required to be used in an amount at least equimolar to the substrate. As reagents for isomerizing glycidates to 2 hydroxy 3 butenoates, there have been known c a proton acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid JP B 19093 1982 , d a strongly acidic cation exchange resin JP B 8669 1979 , and e a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride, aluminum chloride or magnesium chloride JP B 19092 1982 and JP A 22613 1980 . However, the method of using the reagent c has a drawback that an extraction operation is required for the separation of the proton acid used and the resulting product, and in certain cases, a silica gel column must be used for purification, whereby the yield is low. The method of using the reagent d has a drawback that an expensive ion exchange resin must be used in a great amount. In the case of the reagent e , it is necessary to use a great amount of a Lewis acid in a special solvent, and the yield in the isomerization reaction is not good. As catalyst for the production of phenylacetaldehyde by the isomerization of styrene oxide, there has been known an alkaline earth metal sulfonate JP A 106 933 1975 . However, the method has difficulties in the economical feasibility and the stability of the resulting phenylacetaldehyde as the reaction is conducted at a high temperature of at least 200 As catalyst for the isomerization reaction form quadricyclanes to norbornadienes there has been known a cyclopropenylidene palladium complex earlier EP A 0 118 801 . B A 2 052 293 discloses a process and catalyst for preparing unsaturated aliphatic esters from aliphatic dienes.
