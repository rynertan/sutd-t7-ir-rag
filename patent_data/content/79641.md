# Built liquid detergent compositions.

## Abstract
The invention relates to aqueous, built liquid detergent compositions. The inclusion therein of a polysaccharide hydrocolloid as stabilizing agent may give rise to an unacceptable increase in viscosity or gelatin. By using as detergent active material a particular mixture of an anionic and a nonionic detergent material, such increase in viscosity or such gelatin is prevented. The composition is particularly suitable for inclusion therein of enzymes and an enzyme stabilizing system, such as a mixture of glycerol and sodium sulphite.
