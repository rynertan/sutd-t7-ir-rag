In one embodiment where the common wall comprises two first sheets of a flexible material, the infusion unit may include a second sheet of a flexible material secured about its periphery to one of the first sheets, thus defining the first compartment, and a third sheet of a flexible material secured about its periphery to the other of the first sheets, thus defining the second compartment In a further embodiment of the invention, the flexible wall may comprise a single sheet of a flexible material secured about its periphery to a second sheet of a flexible material, thus defining the first compartment and a third sheet of a flexible material secured about its periphery to the first sheet, thus defining the second compartment therebetween. In yet a further embodiment of the invention, the infusion unit may include at least one outer wall which defines a housing, and at least one inner wall located within the housing, at least a portion whereof is flexible and which defines the first compartment, the second compartment being defined by the inner and outer walls.The or each outer wall may be rigid Instead, the inner wall may comprise two first sheets of a flexible material which may be peripherally secured to one another, and the outer wall may comprise two further sheets of a flexible material which may be secured together along at least a portion of their peripheries, and may be secured to the first sheets along the remainder of their peripheries. It will be appreciated that the further sheets could be secured together completely along their peripheries to form a first bag, and the first sheets could be secured together completely along their peripheries to form a second bag inside the first bag. The first communicating means may include a single inlet and outlet port in the first compartment for the passage of the infusion liquid, the port being communicable with a suitable inlet and outlet port alternately. Instead, the first communication means may include a plurality of ports in the first compartment, at least one constituting an inlet port and at least one constituting an outlet port for the passage of the infusion liquid, the or each inlet and outlet ports being communicable with a suitable inlet and outlet system respectively.Where separate inlet and outlet systems are provided, they may each include different coloured tubing to more easily differentiate therebetween. The or each inlet and or outlet ports of the first compartment may have a filter for filtering the infusion liquid entering and or leaving the first compartment. Further, where separate inlet and outlet ports are provided, the or each inlet port may be provided with a nonreturn valve. The second communicating means may include a port in the second compartment for the passage of a fluid into and out of the second compartment. The port may be communicable with a pump for pumping the fluid into the second compartment to pressurise the second compartment and thereby cause the first compartment to decrease in volume.The infusion liquid in the first compartment is thereby expelled through the outlet port. Tubing of a different colour to that used for the inlet outlet systems of the first compartment may be used to connect the port of the second compartment to the pump, to more easily differentiate therebetween. The infusion unit may be used as a collection bag for collecting the infusion liquid. The infusion liquid may be stored therein, and may subsequently be pumped directly therefrom for infusion into a recipient. Instead the infusion unit may be used as an inline transfusion device. For this application the first compartment will have both an inlet and an outlet port In use the inlet port will communicate with a collection storage bag containing the infusion liquid, and the outlet port will be in communication with a recipient of the liquid via the outlet system mentioned above In order to facilitate filling the first compartment with the infusion liquid, the outer surfaces of the unit s walls may be provided with an appropriately located gripping means for enabling the walls to be pulled away from each other, and thus to create a partial vacuum in the first compartment. The invention is now described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a side view of a first embodiment of an infusion unit according to the invention Figure 2 is a longitudinal section through the infusion unit, along II II of Figure 1 Figures 3 to 7 are schematic longitudinal sections through second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth embodiments respectively of an infusion unit according to the invention Like reference numerals are used in the various drawings to show the same parts, unless otherwise specified. In Figures 1 and 2, reference numeral 10 generally indicates a first embodiment of an infusion unit for blood, according to the invention. The infusion unit 10 includes two first sheets 12 of a flexible plastics material, that are peripherally secured to one another to define a first compartment 14 for the blood not shown in the drawings . The unit 10 further includes two larger sheets 16 of the flexible plastics material, that are secured to one another along a portion 18 of their peripheries and to the first sheets 12 along the rest 20 of their peripheries.The larger sheets 16 are secured to the first sheets 12 along a peripheral portion 24 of the latter. The larger sheets 16 and the first sheets 12 located therebetween, define a second compartment 26. Thus the first sheets 12 form a common wall between the first compartment 14 and the second compartment 26. The infusion unit 10 further includes a first communication means for charging and discharging the infusion liquid into and from the first compartment respectively, and a second communication means for charging the second compartment with air. The first communication means includes three adjacent ports 30 in the first compartment 14, each port having an inlet tube 32.1 and two outlet tubes 32.2 and 32.3, all of a plastics material, extending a short distance therefrom. The inlet and outlet tube walls are sufficiently rigid to maintain an open tubular shape in normal use. The inlet tube 32.1 has one end of a flexible plastics receiving tube 34 located therein. The free end of the receiving tube 34 is fitted with a hollow needle 36. Each of the outlet tubes 32.2 and 32.3 is located in a sealed envelope 38 having an integral pull tab 40 for opening the envelope 38, to expose the free end of the outlet tube 32.2 or 32.3. The second communication means includes a port 42 in the second compartment 26, for the passage of air in and out of the compartment 26. The port 42 is fitted with a short inlet outlet tube 44 in which one end of a flexible plastics air tube 46 is sealed. In use, the port 42 communicates via the, air tube 46 with a pump not shown in the drawings for pumping air into the second compartment 26. In order to facilitate filling the first compartment 14 with blood, the outer surface of each of the larger sheets 16 is provided with a gripping formation 46 for enabling the sheets 16, to be pulled away from each other using a clamp 45 to close off the tube 46. Thus a partial vacuum is created in the second compartment 26 which in turn creates a partial vacuum in the first compartment 14. In use, the first compartment 14 of the infusion unit 10 is filled with blood not shown in the drawings from a donor via the hollow needle 36, the receiving tube 34, and the inlet tube 32.1. When the first compartment 14 contains a predetermined volume of blood, the first compartment 14 is suitably sealed. The blood is stored in the unit 10 until required. When the blood is required, one of the envelopes 38 is opened via the pull tab 40, to expose the free end of a first of the outlet tubes 32.2 or 32.3, which is then placed in communication with a blood recipient via any suitable outlet system. The second of the outlet tubes 32.2 or 32.3 is provided merely as a spare. Air is pumped into the second compartment 26 via the port 42, thus pressurising the second compartment 26 and causing the first compartment 14 to decrease in volume.The blood in the first compartment is expelled through the outlet tube 32.2 or 32.3. In Figure 3, reference numeral 60 generally indicates a second embodiment of an infusion unit for blood, according to the invention. The infusion unit 60 is similar to the infusion unit 10 in all respects except in that the larger sheets 16 of the infusion unit 60 are secured to one another along their entire peripheries and are not secured at all to the first sheets 12. In Figure 4, reference numeral 70 generally indicates a third embodiment of an infusion unit for blood, according to the invention. The infusion unit 70 includes a single first sheet 12 of a flexible plastics material, which is secured about its periphery to a second sheet 16 of a flexible plastics material, thus defining a first compartment 14 for the blood not shown in the drawing . The infusion unit 70 further includes a third sheet 17 of a flexible plastics material, which is secured about its periphery to the first sheet 12, thus defining a second compartment 26 therebetween.The first sheet 12 forms a common wall between the first compartment 14 and the second compartment 26. The e infusion unit 70 further includes a first communication means for the first compartment 14, and a second communication means for the second compartment 26. The first and second communication means are similar in all respects to the first and second communication means of the infusion unit 10 as described above and illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The infusion unit 70 is used in a similar manner as described above for the infusion unit 10. That is, the first compartment 14 of the infusion unit 76 is filled with blood and sealed. Thereafter, when blood is required, one of the outlet tubes 32.2 or 32.3 is unsealed and placed in communication with a blood recipient. Air is pumped into the second compartment 26, thus pressurising the second compartment 26 and causing blood to be expelled from the first compartment via the outlet tube 32.2 or 32.3. In Figure 5, reference numeral 80 generally indicates a fourth embodiment of an infusion unit for blood, according to the invention. The infusion unit 80 includes two first sheets 12 of a flexible plastics material and two second sheets 16 of a flexible plastics material, which are identical to the first sheets 12. The four sheets 12 and 16 are secured together by common seals along the entire peripheries thereof. The two first sheets 12 define a first compartment 12 therebetween, and the two second sheets 16 define a second compartment 26 therebetween.Adjacent sheets 12.1 and 16.1 thus are intimately associated to form a common wall between the first compartment 14 and the second compartment 26. The infusion unit 80 further includes a first communication means for the first compartment 14t and a second communication means for the second compartment 26. The first and second communication means of theunit 80 are similar in all respects to the first and second communication means of the infusion unit 10 as described above and illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. It will be seen from Figure 5, however, that the ports 30 in the first compartment 14 are at a bottom end 84 of the unit 80, whereas the port 42 in a second compartment 26 are at a top end 82 of the unit 80. The infusion unit 80 is used in a similar manner as described above for the infusion units 10, 60 and 70. In Figure 6, reference numeral 90 generally indicates a fifth embodiment of an infusion unit for blood, according to the invention. The infusion unit 90 includes two.first sheets 12 of a flexible plastics material, which are peripherally secured together by a flat seal to define a first compartment 14 for the blood not shown in the drawing . The unit 90 further includes two second sheets 16 of the flexible plastics material, which are identical to the sheets 12, and which are peripherally secured together by a flat seal to define a second compartment 26. One of the first sheets 12.1 is secured to one of the second sheets 16.1 along a major portion of their peripheries on the outer side of the flat seals which secure the sheets 12 together and the sheets 16 together respectively. Thus, should one of the compartments 14 or 26 leak, the other of the compartments will be unaffected thereby. The sheets 12.1 and 16.1 remain unsecured only at a top end 92 of the unit 90, and the sheets 12.1 and 16.1 thus are intimately associated to form a common wall between the first and second compartments 14 and 26 respectively. The infusion unit 90 also includes a first communication means for the first compartment 14, and a second communication means for the second compartment 26.The first and second communication means of the infusion unit 90 are similar in all respects to the first and second communication means respectively of the infusion unit 10 as described above and illustrated in Figures I and 2. The infusion unit 90 is used in a similar manner as described above for the infusion units 10, 60, 70 and 80. In Figure 7, reference numeral 100 generally indicates a sixth embodiment of an infusion unit for blood, according to the invention. The unit 100 includes two first sheets 12 of a flexible plastics material which are peripherally secured together to define a first compartment 14 for the blood. The unit 100 further includes a housing 102 having rigid walls 104. A second compartment 26 is defined by the rigid walls 104 and the flexible sheets 12 which form a common wall between the first and second compartments 14 and 26 respectively. The housing 102 has an opening 106 at one end, wherein a closure 108 is snugly received. The unit 100 further includes a first communication means for the first compartment 14, and a second communication means for the second compartment 26. The first and second communication means of the unit 100 are similar in all respects to the first and second communication means of the unit 10 as described above and illustrated in Figure 7, the closure 108 defines passages wherethrough the tubes 32.1, 32.2 and 32.3 for the first compartment 14 are located, and the tube 34 for the second compartment is located. The infusion unit 100 is used in a similar manner as described above for the infusion units 10, 60, 70, 80 and 90. Advantages of the infusion unit of the invention, at least as exemplified, include its versatility of application as a receiving bag and or storage bag for an infusion liquid, and as an infusion liquid supply or inline device, for use in conjunction with a pump as described. Further, the infusion unit of the invention is safe, simple, effective and relatively inexpensive, having a negligible incidence of sepsis and haemolysis of blood cells.
