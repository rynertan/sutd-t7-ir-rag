# Polymer particles and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
An aqueous dispersion of polymer articles each com prising a a syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene having 70 or more of its unsaturated hydrocarbon groups in the side chains and having a melting point of 70 C or higher, b a polymer mixture of said polybutadiene a and other polymer such that a and b co exist in the same particle, or c a copolymer obtained by graft polymerizing a conjugated diene and or other polymerizable monomer on said polybu tadiene a , each of said particles having an average diameter of 10Âµm or less. Said aqueous dispersion can be produced by adding, to an aqueous dispersion of a first catalyst component solution, a conjugated diene monomer and a second catalyst component and polymerizing said conju gated diene monomer the first catalyst component solution contains A a cobalt compound, B an alkali metal, an organometallic compound of a metal of Group I to III of the Periodic Table or a hydride of a metal of Group I to III of the Periodic Table, and C 1 to 1,000 moles, per mole of the cobalt compound A , of a conjugated diene compound and the second catalyst component is carbon disulfide, phenyli sothiocyanic acid or a xanthogen compound.
