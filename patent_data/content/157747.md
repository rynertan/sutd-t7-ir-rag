# A device for translating a rotary motion to a linear one.

## Abstract
A device for translating a rotary motion to a linear one consisting of a first elongate body 1 provided with screw threads extending along the body and a second body 5 ro tatable coaxially with the first body. A number of rollers 3 are arranged between the first and the second body with the axes of the rollers parallel to the axes of the bodies and provided with threads meshing with the screw threads of the first body, the first body being provided with teeth extending substantially along the entire body. Moreover, the rollers have teeth cooperating with the teeth of the first body, one body being displaced relative to the other at the turning of the bodies relative to one another. The second body 5 has threads 6 cooperating with the threads 4 of the rollers 3 , and teeth 11 cooperating with the teeth 9 of the rollers. The threads 2, 4, 6 of the first body 1 , the rollers 3 and the second body 5 are trapezoidal threads, the threads of the rollers 3 and the threads of the second body 5 having the same turning direction and the threads of the first body 1 having a turning direction opposite to the turning direction of the rollers and the second body. The pitch circle 14 of the teeth 8 of the first body 1 is located at some distance from the average diameter 15 of the threads 2 of the first body 1 and the pitch circle 16 of the teeth of each roller 3 , respectively, is located at some distance from the average diameter 17 of the threads 4 of the roller.
