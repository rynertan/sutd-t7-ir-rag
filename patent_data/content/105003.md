# Method of screening resin sealed semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
A method of screening resin sealed semiconductor devices having a resin body 16 for sealing and a semi conductor chip 11 mounted on a die stage 15 having a first and a second bar 10 , said first and second bars extending from said die stage 15 to opposite side surfaces of the body and having a first and a second end 12, 13 exposed to said side surfaces, which method comprises the steps of applying electric voltage 14 between said first and second ends to heat the semiconductor chip 11 , and subjecting the device to screening test.
