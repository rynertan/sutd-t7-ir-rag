# Document feed apparatus.

## Abstract
Document feed apparatus for feeding original documents to a copier imaging station includes a bottom feed shingler wheel 25 which generates a shingled stack of original documents in a tray 20 having a crowned shape, the tray crest being located forward of the shingler wheel. A motor 26 drives the shaft 35 of the shingler wheel and a shaft 43 on which is a separator wheel to drive the bottom sheet of the shingled stack forward. The motor also drives, through a limited torque magnetic hysteresis slip clutch 36 , a shaft 50 carrying a restraint roll 28 . The restraint roll drives any other sheet except the bottom sheet rearward, but can rotate forwardly when in contact with the bottom sheet driven by the separator roll. The normal force between the separator roll and the restraint roll can be adjusted by movement of a spring anchor 102 in a slot 103 .
