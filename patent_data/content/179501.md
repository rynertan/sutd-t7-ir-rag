## Description
The invention concerns a magnetic printing tape cartridge as disclosed in the statement of claim 1. A printer ribbon cartridge device of this type is already known s. US A 4,272,202 . Said type of cartridge is provided for use with daisy wheels and the exposed portion of the tape extends along the whole length of a side of the cartridge. Moreover the clutch mechanism of said device is not very reliable and the brake mechanism is quite complex. Another cartridge is also disclosed in US A 4,428,695 with the same disadvantage of a great exposed portion of the tape. Said device constantly submits the tape to a tension with the consequent risk of breakage. An object of the invention is to provide a magnetic printing tape cartridge which avoids the above mentioned disadvantages. The invention must be usable for a single use cartridge for magnetic printing tapes, which has been designed to be used in special printers for encoding documents, readable by computer. In order to solve said problem, a cartridge according to the statement of claim 1 is provided with the particular features of the characterizing portion of said claim. This cartridge is remarkable due to its special shape which allows it to expose the tape advantageously to the action of the printing head, and due to the fact that it comprises guiding elements for the tape, ensuring its regular movement without jams or breakages during the entire operation. Another feature of this cartridge is that it comprises means for detecting through an external device, the end of the tape, which is then shown automatically, eliminating the need to keep an eye on the cartridge. Also, the cartridge of this invention has several other interesting features which will become obvious at the end of this description. Other embodiments of the invention result from claims 2 to 6. The cartridge features and mode of operation will be explained with reference to the attached set of drawings. Figure 1 is a trop view of the closed cartridge. Figure 2 is a view from below of the closed cartridge. Figure 3 is a front view of the closed cartridge. Figure 4 is a trop view of the open cartridge showing its internal structure in its rest condition. Figure 5 shows details of the operation of the device for tightening the tape and braking the storage spool at the start of the tape. Figure 6 is a cross section through plane A B of Fig. 5. Figure 7 is a perspective view of the tightening braking device. Figure 8 is a cross section through plane C D of Fig. 4. Figure 9 is a cross section through plane E F of Fig. 4. Figure 10 is a cross section through plane G H of Fig. 4. Figure 11 is a front exploded view of the spool illustrated in Figure 10. As it may be seen on the drawings listed above, and especially on Figures 1 to 3, the cartridge is made up of a box 6 , with a lid 7 which, jointly, form a flattened down and substantially prismatic receptable from one of its longer edges, there is a coplanar and slightly off centered projecting protrusion with a frontally open cross aperture 12 defined by overlaying of an opening in the box 6 and an orifice which is coaxial to the opening and provided in the lid 7 . Inside the box 6 , there are two spools 15 and 8 to store and wind the tape 10 , respectively, each one of which has a detachable core. As it will be seen later, the core 9 of the winding spool 8 is not integral with it, so as to lie able to slide angularly, under certain conditions, to form a clutch which will prevent the tape from breaking, wherea the core 4 of the storage spool 15 has a radial protrusion 22 through which it locks itself with the spool to drag it along its angular movement. As better seen on Figure 9, it also receives on its lower part the tangential pressure of an elastic rod 14 shown in perspective view by Figure 7 and the assembly of which may be seen Figures 4 and 5, this rod constituting the tightening and braking means which will ensure the correct movements of the tape. Finally, also inside the box 6 and on pins integral with it, there are a series of guiding rollers 1 arranged to lead the tape 10 from the storage pool 15 to the front of the cross aperture 12 provided across the side protrusion of the cartridge, as well as two driving rollers 5 and 11 which pull on the tape and feed it to the winding spool 8 . After this general description of the cartridge, the features of its main operating parts and their mode of operation will be now described in detail. Starting with the tightening and braking device, formed of the elastic rod 14 , it will be seen that the rod has its two ends folded along two planes perpendicular to each other and that on one of these ends, there is a roller 2 with a radial fin that stands out on its tip. This rod 14 is built in on the bottom of the box 6 so that the folded end 16 which has no roller, is caught in a notch made in that bottom see Figs. 4 and 5 and so that, at a point along its length located between the embedded end and the core 4 of the tape storage spool, it lies against a stop 17 coplanar with the bottom of the box 6 , being retained under a horizontal projection 18 . In this situation, and in the rest position, the rod, as seen in Figs. 4, 5 and 9, is tangentially forced on the core 4 of the storage spool 15 , preventing any undesired rotation and, therefore,the unwinding of the tape. The driving rollers 5 and 11 are each provided with a ring gear 3 made of an elastic material so as not to damage the tape and which gear together, leading the tape on its bias. One of the rollers 5 freely rotates between two bearings set up in the inner faces of the lid and of the cartridge. The other roller 11 , as best seen in Fig. 2, is accessible from the outside through an aperture provided at the bottom of the cartridge, and may be geared by a driving axle, thus becoming a driving roller. The tape driving rollers 5 and 11 ensure the regular advance of this tape when passing through the opening provided in the side protrusion of the cartridge, in which opening 12 the type wheel used for printing is housed. However, the tape winds around the winding spool 8 through the rotation of that spool, which is controlled by a driving axle coupled to its core 9 . The angular movement of the core 9 is synchronized with that of the driving rollers 5 and 11 and both are constant. However, the diameter increase of the tape 10 as the latter winds around the spool 8 leads to a gradual increase of the tape linear speed at the periphery of the winding, which could break a taut tape if it did not have a clutch. This clutch, as better shown in Figs. 10 and 11, works by giving the spool 8 an independent core 9 , which is pushed axially by an elastic washer 20 on an inner peripheral lug 29 , of the spool itself, so that it tends to rotate along with it, but it may angularly skid with respect to the spool under certain conditions of tape tautness, absorbing the differences between the winding speed and the feeding speed of the driving rollers. The specific form of construction of the clutch is clearly shown in Fig. 11 which is an exploded view of the spool 8 . As it may be seen, the spool has two circular wings 23 and 24 each having a hollow and axial projection 25 and 26 , which can be coupled together, one around the other, to make up a central cavity. Its angular interlocking is ensured by linking protrusions 28 designed on one of the projections and which fit into openings 27 cut in the other. Inside the central cavity defined by the protrusions 25 and 26 , there is a hollow core 9 which is axially pressed against the lug 29 , by means of the elastic washer 20 and which, therefore, tends to rotate the spool, until the pressure of this elastic washer becomes lower than the resistance opposed by the tape at this moment, it skids. Finally, the cartridge such as described is provided with means allowing to detect the end of the tape through an external device. This device, as better seen in Figs. 4 and 9, is made up by the combination of a window 30 opening in one side of the cartridge, for the tape to go through 10 and of a protrusion 29 facing the window and which is hollow 31 so as to house a reflecting body which faces a photoelectric cell when the cartridge is mounted on the machine it is destined for. The operation is very simple. The tape end 10 will also be made of a reflecting material at its tail or final end. The photoelectric cell facing the window 30 reads the dark color of the tape while the latter is used with the cartridge in the machine. However, as soon as the tape comes to an end, and its reflecting part faces the cell, the cell reacts and lights a pilot lamp. Naturally, withdrawing the cartridge has the same effect, because the photoelectric cell would directly face the reflecting body which, when the cartridge is placed inside the machine, is located in the hollow part 31 of the protrusion 29 . This invention is in no way limited to the details such as described and shown because many changes and modifications could be made thereto without departing from the scope of the present patent.
