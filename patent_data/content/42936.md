# Pulsed sine wave oscillating circuit.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a pulsed sine wave oscillating circuit arrangement, including a resonant circuit 20 having an inductor 14 through which current flow is to be accurately controlled and a capacitor 15 substantially connected in parallel with said inductor 14 , and having a sampling resistor 18 in series circuit with said inductor, said resonant circuit 20 having an effective damping resistance element 40 in parallel therewith, a source 24 of electric pulses of substantially constant pulse repetition rate and a pulsing circuit 22 , 26 , 28 coupled to said pulse source 24 and to said circuit for applying pulsated current to said resonant circuit. The circuit arrangement further comprises a servo circuit 44,46 having an input circuit connected across said sampling resistor 16 and an output circuit connected to said pulsing circuit for delivering to said resonant circuit 20 , a pulse of electric energy in each cycle of operation substantially replacing that dissipated in said effective damping resistance element during the previous cycle.
