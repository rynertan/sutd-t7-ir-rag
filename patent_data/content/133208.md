# Removal of acidic gases from gaseous mixtures.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an improved acid gas physical absorption process of the kind in which a feedstock gas containing the acid components is contacted with a solvent, preferably a polyethylene glycoldimethylether, at relatively low tem perature and relatively high pressure to absorb the acid gas components thereof. The solvent, after enriching, is re generated by stripping the acid gas components therefrom by applying heat energy, preferably steam as a stripping gas at relatively high temperature and relatively low pres sure. In the improved process, a bottom stream is with drawn from the stripping tower 24 and it is flashed at a relatively low pressure, then compressed in compressor 33 and reintroduced into the stripper tower 24 at a lower portion thereof to serve as part of the stripping gas. The improved process thus reduces requirements for utility steam.
