# UNDERSHEET FOR PREVENTING BED SORES

## Abstract
A patient care undersheet 10 includes a minimum num ber of support points in order to keep a bedridden patient from developing decubitus ulcers. The undersheet 10 preferably comprises a bottom layer 3 having a number of conically shaped bubble like supports 36 and a top layer 32 compris ing a non woven fabric. An adhesive material 34 connects the non woven fabric 32 to the bubble like supports 36 in such a manner that under pressure the bubble like supports 36 do not move with respect to each other. The bubble like supports 36 are air tight so that the undersheet 10 does not collapse under the pressure of a patient s body. The area of contact 48 of the top 46 of the bubble like supports 36 to the non woven fabric 132 is approximately 40 of the total top surface of the undersheet 10 . A patient only has to move a very small distance before a new area of skin is supported by the undersheet.
