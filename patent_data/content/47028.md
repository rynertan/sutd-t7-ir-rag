## Abstract
The invention is relating to a method and device for sterilizing holders containing products with the aid of heated fluid in a device receiving the holders, whereby the holders are continuously passed through an elongate passage across the device and the fluid is introduced at a pressure into the passage at a feeding point located between the ends of the elongate passage and is allowed to escape near the two ends of the passage whilst causing the pressure of the fluid during its flow to progressively decrease from the feeding point to the ends of the passage.
