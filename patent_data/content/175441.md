# Ultrasonic wheel probe with acoustic barrier.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic wheel probe of the type having a wheel shaped container with an annular outer surface for rotating about an axis of rotation and rolling upon a specimen to be test ed is provided with a plurality of transducers for transmitting and receiving ultrasonic acoustic energy, respectively. In ac cordance with the invention, an acoustic barrier is interposed between the transmitting and receiving transducers, and im mersed in the coupling fluid, so as to isolate the transmitting and receiving transducers from one another. With this arrange ment, echoes emanating from the interface, or surface, of the specimen being tested are prevented from reaching the receiv ing transducer. The acoustic barrier is preferably installed on a yoke of the wheel probe so as to be displaceable in a substan tially radial direction in response to the contour of the specimen being tested. The radial alignment of the acoustic barrier is maintained by a pair of shafts which extend through the yoke and have linear bearings interposed therein. A resilient el ement, such as a spring, is arranged to urge the acoustic barrier to its maximum extent from the axis of rotation. An additional transducer is arranged to communicate ultrasonically with the acoustic barrier so as to monitor its radial location at all times. The signals produced by this monitoring transducer can be uti lized to control feedback and gate triggering circuitry.
