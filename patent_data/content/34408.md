# A method of forming an anticorrosive coating on a metal electrode substrate.

## Abstract
A method of forming an anticorrosive coating on the surface of a metal substrate comprises coating the surface of the metal substrate with an anticorrosive metal capable of forming an alloy with the substrate metal using a spraying procedure. The coated surface is then heated in a vacuum or in an atmosphere substantially inert to the metal coating and metal substrate by irradiating electron beams or a plasma arc thereonto to form an alloy layer in the interface between the metal substrate and the metal coating. Preferably, subse quent to the coating step and prior to the irradiation step, a solution of a thermally decomposable platinum group metal compound is coated on the surface of the resulting coating, and the coated product is then heat treated at about 50 to about 300 C.
