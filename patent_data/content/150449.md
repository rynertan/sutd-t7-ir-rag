# Data processing device.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a data processing device which is equipped with a plurality of arithmetic units so that a plurality of instructions may be processed in parallel by the plural arithmetic units. The data processing device includes a plurality of physical registers for holding the processed results of the arithmetic units means for holding the corresponding relationship between logical registers assigned by the instructions and the physical registers and conversion means for assigning the plural instructions to said arithmetic units and for assigning the different physical registers in a manner to correspond to the logical registers in the respective instructions, when the instructions designated by an identical one of said logical registers are present in plurality in the instructions to be parallel processed, to hold the assigned physical registers in said holding means. Said arithmetic units hold the processed results in the physical registers held in said holding means.
