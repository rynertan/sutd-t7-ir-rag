Connector comprises a housing 12 having a conductor receiving end 16 and terminals 28 therein which receive wires and establish contact therewith. A cover 70 is provided which is assembled to the connector housing 12 . The apparatus comprises a housing jig 132, 134 , a cover jig 106 which is opposed to the housing jig, and a cable locator 98, 100 which locates the cable between the two jigs. Cooperating cutter blades 116, 148 may be provided on the jigs so that when they are moved towards each other, the cable will be cut and the conductors moved into the terminals 28 in the connector housing 12 . The housings and covers are produced as continuous strip material 168, 172 which is fed to the two jigs. Strip material cutters 122, 178, 126 are provided for cutting a connector housing and a section of cover members from the strip at the time of installation of the connector on the cable.
