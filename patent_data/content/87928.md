## Description
Process for the hydrogenation of carbonaceous material The present invention relates to the catalytic hydrogenation of liquid carbonaceous material, e.g. bitumen, heavy oil, oil shale and conventional crude vacuum residues and substances derived therefrom. Bitumen, heavy oil, oil shale and conventional crude vacuum residues can be hydrogenated at high temperatures and high hydrogen pressures to yield liquids and gases of lower molecular weight. It is known to hydrogenate bitumen and coal slurries in the pretence of a heterogeneous catalysts, e.g. Co Mo, supported on an alumina or silica base. The use of such supported catalysts increases the take up of hydrogen and improves the yield and quality of the desirable distillate fraction, that is to say light oils and liquid fuel. It is however economically prohibitive. Also, the alumina or silica base tends to promote coke formation, which blinds and deactivates the catalyst. Coke should also be avoided because it clogs the hydrogenation reactor and reduces the yield of the desirable distillate.Furthermore, the presence in the carbonaceous feedstock of impurities, e.g. sulphur, titanium dioxide, vanadium, clays and silica leads to fouling of the catalyst and renders it inactive. A great deal of research has gone into developing supported catalysts that can reduce coking and resist fouling by impurities, but the limited stability of these supported catalysts has made their use uneconomic. Unsupported heterogeneous catalysts have been proposed, but they suffer from one or more of the disadvantages that 1 they are not as effective as supported catalysts 2 they are unstable under hydrogenation conditions and 3 they are difficult to separate from the solid residue obtained after hydrogena tion in order to be recycled. The present invention is based on the discovery that in the catalytic hydrogenation of liquid carbonaceous material the use of nickel carbonate to provide the catalyst reduces coke formation and improves the yield of the desired distillate fraction. Accordingly the present invention consists in a process for the catalytic hydrogenation of liquid carbdnaceous materials in which the catalyst is provided by the addition of nickel carbonate to the reaction mixture. The nickel carbonate is preferably added to the carbonaceous material in the form of a slurry of nickel carbonate in oil, either before or during hydrogenation. The temperature at which the hydrogenation is carried out depends on the products desired, more light weight products being produced at higher temperatures. Unfortunately the use of high temperatures can give rise to coke formation, but we have found that under the conditions that give rise to coke formation the amount of coke is reduced by the addition of nickel carbonate. Also, the addition of nickel carbonate increases the amount of the desired distillate that is obtained by hydrogenation. The hydrogenation process of the present invention is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of from 400 to 5000C, since at temperatures above 500 C coke formation is excessive and at temperatures below 400C insufficient hydrogenation is achieved. The hydrogen partial pressure used is preferably from 3,500 to 35,000 kN m2. Higher pressures are impracticable and lower pressures result in insufficient hydrogenation. After hydrogenation, a typical procedure is to cool the reaction mixture, vent the gases through a condenser and distil the hydrogenation products to recover the liquid products the distillate . The distillation residue or bottoms, which contains the catalyst, can then be mixed with further carbonaceous material and the hydrogenation stage repeated. Use of nickel carbonate according to the present invention has a particular advantage in that under mild conditions that do not give rise to coke formation the carbonaceous material can be hydrogenated to extinction to give methane and light petroleum as the only net products. Under these conditions, the catalyst can be re cycled for use in a large number of hydrogenation steps. Under more severe conditions, in which the hydrogenation of bitumen or other liquid hydrocarbons gives some solid carbonaceous residue, some of the distillation bottoms should be bled off to avoid an excessive build up of coke and viscous heavy oil.The material bled off will of course contain some catalyst, and it is preferably coked to recover further distillate and the coke residue then treated to recover the nickel content of the catalyst. Advantageously the nickel may be leached from the coke by contacting it, in the presence of oxygen, with an aqueous mineral acid solution, e.g.of sulphuric acid, having a pH not greater than 3.The leaching is preferably performed at a temperature of at least 700C, and most preferably not less than 1000C, and under an oxygen partial pressure of not less than 20 kN m2 and most preferably not less than 275 kN m2.The pH is advantageously about 0. The nickel may be recovered from the leach solution in any known way, e.g.by electrowinning. Alternatively the nickel may be recovered from the coke residue by smelting it to a matte, e.g. with pyrrhotite. In any event, when only part of thedistilla tion residue or bottoms is recycled, the remainder being bled off and treated to recover its nickel content, a corresponding amount of nickel carbonate should be added to the reaction mixture to maintain its catalyst content. As will be appreciated from the above discussion, the process of the present invention may be performed either on a batch basis or continuously, although the latter is preferred, particulariy when the hydrogenation conditions are such that substantially no coke is formed during hydrogenation. The reactions that occur in the hydrogenation of carbonaceous materials are complex. It may be that the nickel carbonate does not itself act as a catalyst, but that it is converted under the conditions prevailing during hydrogenation into a different chemical species which is the catalyst. Whether or not that is the case, we have found that the addition of nickel carbonate to the hydrogenation reaction mixture reduces the amount of coke produced and increases the amount of light oil produced. The exact chemical composition of the nickel carbonate is not critical, and for the purpose of this specification and claims the term nickel carbonate includes basic nickel carbonate, which is the form in which it is most cheaply and readily available. Some examples will now be given. Example 1 In this Example, four tests were performed in each of which 400 g of Athabasca bitumen having the following composition in weight percent C 82.7 H 10.4 N 0.4 0 1.64 S 4.23 Ash 0.6 and also containing, in parts per million Ni 77 V 220 Fe 409 and having a Conradson carbon residue of 12.6 , were charged into a feed pot together with 4.0 g of NiCO3 and heated to about 1500 C. Hydrogen was introduced into the feed pot at a pressure sufficient to force the hot, fluid bitumen into a high pressure autoclave, which was then pressurised with hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide to a hydrogen pressure of about 6900 kN m2. The autoclave was then heated to the desired temperature 4250C or 4500C and the hydrogen pressure topped off at 20,670 kN m2. The temperature and pressure were maintained in the autoclave for 30 minutes whereupon the autoclave was cooled to 2500C and all but 3,450 kN m2 of the overpressure was vented through a cold 6 C condenser fitted with an internal metal demister and collected in 40 litre sample tanks for gas chromatographic analysis. The autoclave contents were then transferred to a glass resin kettle fitted for safety with a 69 kN m2 graphite rupture disc and an explosion proof shield. All gas products were again vented through the condenser and collected for analysis. The hydrogenation products were then distilled by gradually heating them to 3500C while collecting distillate. This produced a still head temperature of about 2500C. The distillation bottoms were then returned to the feed pot, enough further bitumen was added to make up a 400 g charge and the procedure described above was repeated. The process was operated for six complete cycles or until the still bottoms became too viscous to handle. The cold condenser was allowed to warm to room temperature and any gas evolved was collected and assayed and the condenser drained to yield a naphtha fraction. Details of the tests and of the products formed are set out in Table 1. In Tests Nos. II and IV NiCO3 was used in accordance with the invention, while Tests Nos. I and III are comparative tests in which no NiCO3 was added.

Furt nermore, it will be noted that Test III had to be t rminated prematurely because the distillation residue or bottoms had become too viscous to recycle and hat Test I produced a very large proportion of distillation bottoms. Example 2 Four further tests were performed, Nos.VI arid VIII using NiCO3 additions and Nos. V and VII without NiCO3, using the same procedure as in Example 1 e ept that the hydrogenation distillation steps were repeated until a steady state was reached. In the tests at 4500C in which coke was formed sufficient of the distillation bottoms was bled off after each hydrogenation step to remove the amount of coke generated in tilat step.The amount of catalyst that was also remcved in this way in Test VIII was replaced by the addition of a corresponding amount of NiCO3 to the reaction mixture before the subsequent hydrogenation step The results of these tests are shown inTable 2, which also shows the percentage of the bitumen that is recycled when the system has reached a steady state.

In Test V with no NICO3 addition the proportion of bottoms recycled at steady state is also very high while the proportion of distillate and naphtha in the hydrogenation products is much less than in Test VI.
