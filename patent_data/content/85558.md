# Supervision of automatic switching systems.

## Abstract
An automatic switching system includes a central office 3b and a remote office 10b connected to the central office by way of a time division multi channel line HWo . The remote office includes a remote office time division switching system 50 , connected to the multichannel line, and a remote office supervising unit 60 for monitoring the operation of the remote office, and the central office includes a central office time division switching system 70 , connected to the said multichannel line, and a central supervisory unit 80 for processing supervisory data produced by the remote office supervisory unit. In use, the supervisory data is allocated at the remote office to one or more predetermined channels SCHo of the multichannel line, predetermined output signal lines of the central office time division switching system being connected to the central supervisory unit and serving to transfer such supervisory data thereto. Such a system serves to avoid any need for a separate connecting line, between the remote and central offices, dedicated solely to the transfer of the supervisory data.
