## Description
TITLE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION OF MATTER FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a composition for improved absorption of drugs which are poorly watersoluble and poorly absorbed. Particularly, this invention relates to a composition of matter in pharmaceutical dosage form comprising 4 monoalkylamino benzoic acid and derivatives and non ionic surfactants, providing enhanced blood levels of 4 monoalkylamino benzoic acid and derivatives for the treatment of atherosclerosis hypolipidemia. A method of increasing drug absorption particularly 4 monoalkylamino benzoic acid and derivatives by administration of such drug in concert with greater than about 10 surfactant is described. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 4 monoalkylamino benzoic acid and derivatives has been found to be an effective pharmaceutical agent in the treatment of atherosclerosis and hypolipidemia. The general range of effective blood levels of this drug is generally from about 1 microgram per ml. to about 10 milligrams per ml. However, a relatively low rate of absorption of polyalkylaminobenzoic acid across the gut wall has required relatively large oral dosages to be administered to effect an effective final concentration. Doses of 100 to 300 mg. kg. body weight gave less than 1 microgram per milligram serum level. A number of substances have been investigated and found to enhance transport of polyalkyl aminobenzoic acid across the gut wall.Among these are coprecipitates of polyalkylaminobenzoic acid and derivatives and polyhydroxylic compounds such as lactose, and polyethylene glycol, U.S Application Serial No. , Attorney s Docket No. 27,804 , filed on even date herewith.Another is a coprecipitate with polyvinylpyrrolidine which is the subject of Application U.S. Serial No. Attorney s docket No. 27,176 filed on even date herewith.

Drug Assoc., 28, 83 1969 DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention is particularly concerned with a composition of matter comprising a compound of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is an unbranched or branched alkyl group CnH2n 1 wherein n is 8 to 19 and R2 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, benzyl, dilower alkylaminoethyl, or lower alkoxyethyl together with the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof hereafter polyalkylaminobenzoic acid and non ionic surfactants. The above described compounds, their use as hypolipidemic agents and conventional pharmaceutical dosage forms for these products are fully disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,868,416. It has now been discovered that a composition of matter comprising of one of the aforementioned compounds and non ionic surfactants provides a product which, when administered orally to warm bloodied animals, provides for substantially enhanced blood levels of the therapeutic component when compared with the oral administration of one of the aforementioned compounds alone. A particularly surprising aspect of this invention is the discovery that substances that may be absorbed only slowly from the intestinal tract find enhanced absorption when in combination with surfactant at much higher levels of surfactant than had been hitherto thought useful. These levels of surfactant must be about 10 W W . Further, the surfactant need not dissolve the drug, a mixture or suspension as in the case of polyalkylaminobenzoic acid, being suitable. Drugs which are poorly water soluble, and poorly absorbed, find enhanced absorption in the composition of this invention. The preferred drug surfactant ratio range is from about 1 33 to 1 1 i.e. about 3 drug to about 50 drug . Most preferred is a composition of about 3 to about 27 drug. The percentages of surfactant previously used are described in Micellization, Solubilization, and Microemulsions Vol. 1 K.L. Mittal plenum Press, 1977 particularly p. 66 et seq. Clearly the enhancement of absorption is dependent on how poorly the drug is absorbed without surfactant. Further, in keeping with a suggestion, increased solubilization into intestinal micelles being a possible method of increasing absorption, an increased lipophilic nature of the drug will cause an increase in the enhancement of absorption. This effect is true for all drugs that are poorly absorbed from the intestinal tract and particularly those which are lipophilic. Some of the drugs suitable for particular enhancement of absorption are the poorly absorbed, poorly water soluble members of the following classes CNS agents such as anticonvulsants e.g. phenacemide, phenantoin particularly diphenylhydantoin, autonomic drugs such as skeletal muscle relaxants e.g. chlorphenesin carbamate, mephenesin carbamate particularly methocarbamol hormones such as steroids and corticosteroids e.g.fluprednisdone, meprednisone , particularly prednisone anti infective agents such as antifungal antibiotics e.g. emetine, glycobiarsol particularly griseofulvin cardiovascular agents such as hypocholesteremics e.g.clofibrate, dextrothyroxine particularly probucol. The preferred non ionic surfactants are generally the polysorbates, particularly polysorbate 60, polysorbate 65, polysorbate 80, and polysorbate 85 with polysorbate 80 being most preferred. Polysorbate 80 is sorbitan mono 9 octadecenoate, polyoxyethylene derivative. The preferred compositions are in the form of a mixture or suspension of the drug particles of 50 microns or less, average diameter with a surfactant. The smallest average particle sizes are most preferred. The p hexadecylaminobenzoic acid sodium salt is the preferred form of the active substance. This composition is prepared as a 5 to 50 aqueous suspension of for example p hexadecylaininobenzoic acid sodium salt, initially containing 2 to 50 polysorbate 80. Heat may be used to affect suspension and the water may or may not be removed from the suspension after formation but the final surfactant concentration is at least about 10 . Non aqueous suspensions and oil in water emulsions are also prepared. Suitable oils are sesame oil, The categories cited are those of the Hospital Formulary of the American Society of Hospital Pharmacies. olive oil, mineral oil, rape seed oil and other pharmaceutically acceptable oils. The hexadecylaminobenzoic acid compositions of this invention are administered to warm blooded animals in amounts ranging from about 5 mg. to about 200 mg. based on the active component, E hexadecylaminobenzoic acid sodium salt content per kilogram of body weight per day.A preferred dosage regimen for optimum results would be from about 5 mg. to about 50 mg. of active component per kilogram of body weight per day and such dosage units are employed that a total of from about 350 mg. to about 3.5 g.of the active component for a subject of about 70 kg. of body weight are administered in a 24 hour period. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the situation. A decided practical advantage of this invention is that the composition may be administered orally. Dosage forms wherein the therapeutic compound comprises up to 90 of the dosage form by weight may be used, surfactant of at least about 10 of the dosage weight is usually required though dosage of about 3 to 50 therapeutic compound is preferred and about 3 to 29 therapeutic compounds are most preferred. This composition may be administered orally, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier, or it may be enclosed in soft shell gelatin capsules, or it may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. The bioavailability of the compositions of this invention was compared with that of hexadecylamino benzoic acid sodium salt by the following procedures. Normal and 14C labeled hexadecylaminobenzoic acid sodium salt were formed in compositions with polysorbate 80 at varying concentrations, according to procedures given in the following examples and filled in soft shell gelatin capsules or filled as single doses in 5 ml. R Glaspak syringes. Control capsules were prepared by mixing and spatulating for 5 minutes 1.320 g. of normal or 14C labeled p hexadecylaminobenzoic acid sodium salt, 1.776 g. of lactose monohydrate and 64.8 mg. of modified starch. About 0.5 ml. of water was added dropwise with mixing to form granules, which were then dried at 500C. for 18 hours.The granules were passed through a No. 17 sieve, 32.4 mg.of sodium lauryl sulfate and 32.4 mg. of magnesium stearate were passed through the sieve and mixed with the granules by spatulation for 3 minutes and the resultant mixture was then filled in hard shell gelatin capsules. The particle sizes of active material in all mixtures or capsules were qualitatively similar. The capsule formulations were administered orally to dogs by hand insertion and the other compositions were administered by gavage. The dogs were purebred male beagles from Marshall Research Animals Inc., North Rose,New York. All dose administrations were followed by a 30 ml. water wash. The capsule formulations were administered orally to monkeys by use of a balling gun and other compositions by gavage. The monkeys were male and female MacacaFascicularis monkeys from Primate Imports, Port Washington,New York. All dose administrations were followed by a 2 ml. wash of grape juice. All animals had free access to water at all times. They were fed in the morning of the days preceding and following the day of drug administration.Half of the monkeys in the comparative fed vs. fasted study were fed their normal diet one hour prior to drug administration. For those studies in which blood was collected, the animals were not fed again until after the 23 or 24 hour blood samples were collected. TM Each dog was fed 300 g. of Respond 2000tom dog food Agway Country Foods, Waverly, New York daily. On the days of feeding, the monkeys were provided Purina Monkey Chow Ralston Purina Co., St. Louis,Missouri in the morning and given bread and fruit in the afternoon. The dogs were housed in individual cages designed to collect the voided urine separately from the feces. The urine was collected at room temperature in individual two liter polyethylene containers. The collection pans were washed with 50 100 ml. of water after each urine collection and each rinse was added to the respective daily collection of urine. Blood samples were obtained from the monkeys from their femoral artery and injected immediately into 10 ml. CorvacR tubes and allowed to clot. The tubes were centrifuged and the sera were pipetted directly into both counting vials and acid washed conical tubes. The samples for fluorometric analysis were frozen until analyzed. The radioactivity measurements were made as follows All samples were counted in 10 ml. 3a70B phosphor Research Products International Corp. using a BeckmanLS9000 Liquid Scintillation Spectrophotometer. Two drops of saturated aqueous ascorbic acid solution were added to each sample to minimize chemiluminescence. Conversion to absolute radioactivity was performed by use of the internal computer synthesized channels ratio calibration curve based on sealed quenched carbon 14 standards. Daily urine collection samples of less than one liter were diluted to one liter with water and mixed.Urine samples of one ml. each were counted in either triplicate or quadruplicate for each time period. Single and duplicate 0.5 ml. serum samples were analyzed. Onehalf ml. of water was added to each serum containing vial to prevent gel separation of the final counting mixture. The serum samples were assayed by a fluorometric method as follows Aliquot volumes of from 0.1 to 0.5 ml.were analyzed. For samples of less than 0,5 ml., water was added to bring the volume to 0.5 ml. The samples were transferred to acid washed 15 ml. glass stoppered centrifuge tubes and 0.4 ml. of water and 0.5 ml. of freshly prepared 4 potassium hydroxide in 95 ethanol were added.The contents were mixed on a vortex mixer, stoppered and heated for 75 minutes at 950C., then cooled to room temperature. A 3.5 ml. portion of water acetic acid 4 3 was added and the contents were mixed. Eight ml. of hexane containing 3 isoamyl alcohol was added, the contents were shaken vigorously and then centrifuged. A 3 ml. portion of the organic layer was transferred to a cuvette and the fluorescence was measured on a Perkin Elmer Model 1000Fluorescence Spectrophotometer equipped with a constant voltage power supply excitation 300 nm. Oriel interference filter emission 339 nm. Perkin Elmer interference filter, mirrored side facing sample compartment, narrow slit width, scale expansion knob turned fully counter clockwise.The results were compared to a standard curve plotted from results obtained in the same manner using samples of 14 4C labeled 4 hexadecylamino benzoic carboxy 14C acid, 2,3 dihydroxypropyl ester. The results of these tests appear in the following tables, I, II, III, IV and V.

Exa nple 1 A 5 g. portion of p hexadecylaminobenzoic acid sodium salt is added to a solution of one ml. of polysorbate 80 in 15 ml. of water and mixed thoroughly. Evaporation of the water leaves a suspension of the drug in polysorbate 80 which is suitable for oral administration. Example 2 A 550 mg. portion of hexadecylaminobenzoic acid sodium salt is placed in a glass mortar. A 17,783 mg.portion of polysorbate 80 is added slowly with constant trituration. The resulting suspension may be administered orally. Example 3 A 550 mg. portion of p hexadecylaminobenzoic acid sodium salt is placed in a glass mortar. A 500 mg. portion of polysorbate 80 is added and mixed with a mortar. The resulting paste is filled in gelatin capsules suitable for oral administration. Example 4 A mixture of 550 mg. of p hexadecylaminobenzoic acid sodium salt, 500 mg. of polysorbate 80 and 55 mg. of lecithin are mixed thoroughly in a glass mortar. The resulting paste is filled in gelatin capsules suitable for oral administration. Example 5 An oil in water emulsion was prepared by mixing 35 gm. sesame oil, 3 gm. Atmul 845, and 7 gm. polysorbate 60, and slowly adding 40 gm. water with good agitation, then passing the resulting mass through a hand homogenizer.To this was added with agitation a suspension of 5 gm.p hexadecylaminobenzoic acid sodium salt in 8 gm. water, to obtain a suspension of the active component in an oil inwater emulsion. The resulting suspension may be administered orally.
