# Disposable diapers with elastically contractible waistbands.

## Abstract
Disposable diapers having elasticized waistbands which allow the diapers to breathe and which reduce the in cidence of waistband rollover. The waistbands are formed by affixing elastic elements between the topsheets and the backsheets in the waistband region of the diapers using regularly spaced, transversely extending regions of secure ment. Regions of nonsecurement are formed between pairs of the regions of securement thereby forming channels which allow the diaper to breathe and also forming corruga tons which tend to inhibit waistband rollover.
