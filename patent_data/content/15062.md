# Method for connecting electrical wire to a terminal pin.

## Abstract
A method for welding an electrical lead wire 30, 32, 34 to a terminal pin 50, 52, 54 with the use of a laser beam. The method is particularly designed for use in welding an electri cal lead wire 30, 32, 34 of an exhaust gas sensor 46,48 to a terminal pin 50, 52, 54 having an opening through which the electrical lead wire 30, 32, 34 extends to the exterior of the pin 50, 52, 54 . The lead wire 30, 32, 34 may be made of nichrome material and the terminal pin 50, 52, 54 from leaded steel. The laser beam is positioned vertically above the extended portion of the lead wire 50, 52, 54 and its focal point 74 is above the end 66 of the lead wire. No separate filler metal is required since the lead wire material is itself available as a filler material.
