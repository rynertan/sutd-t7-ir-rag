# PUMPING AND TIRE DEFLATION WARNING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system is disclosed for warning that the pressure in one tire T1 of a pair of dual tyres is more than a predetermined amount below the pressure in the other T2 . The system comprises a device 10 fitted to the valve stem of the outer tire T1 and having a single air inlet 20 and two air outlets 16, 24 connected one to each tire. Within the device 10 two pistons are subjected to tire pressures and themselves act on a lever. When the tire pressures differ, the forces on the lever are unbalanced, and the lever tilts. A trigger unit 30 is mounted on the rim R2 of the inner tire T2 and linked to the lever by a stiff wire 32 . When the wire is displaced, a spring loaded arm 182 of the trigger unit 30 is released. On the body of the vehicle there is a switch 34 the operating member 270 of which is struck by the spring loaded arm 182 after that arm has been released. The switch is connected to a warning device in the vehicle cab.
