The compound I or its pharmaceitucally acceptable salt or its ester obtained in this manner can be further purified by the conventional procedures such as thin layer chromatography for fractionation, column chromatography and recrystallization method, if necessary. When the compound I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or its ester thus obtained has the protective group, such protective group can be removed, if desired. As the procedure of removing said protective group, the conventional procedures such as removal with an acid, removal with a base, removal with hydrazine, removal through reduction and the procedure of bringing the protected compound into contact with an iminohalogenating agent and then an iminoetherifying agent and conducting hydrolysis, if necessary, can be suitably selected and carried out, depending upon the type of such protective group.In the case of a procedure of removal with an acid, the useful acids which may vary depending upon the kind of protective groups and other conditions include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, benzenesulfonic acid and p toluenesulfonic acid as well as acidic ion exchange resins, etc. In the event of the procedure of removal with a base, the useful bases, which vary with the type of protective groups and other conditions, include inorganic bases such as hydroxides and carbonates of alkali metals, e.g. sodium and potassium, or alkaline earth metals, e.g. calcium and magnesium, and organic bases such as metal alkoxides, organic amines and quaternary ammonium salts as well as basic ion exchange resins, etc.When a solvent is used in the above procedure of removal of the protecting group with acid or base, hydrophilic organic solvents, water or a mixed solvent thereof are often employed.

G.Christensen et al. Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 45, pp. 1130 1980 . The protective groups, R7 and R8, are in no way restricted in the selection thereof, unless they interfere in the.subsequent reactions, and are organosilyl groups such as trimethylsilyl and t butyldimethylsilyl or cyclic ethers such as 2 tetrahydropyranyl. Furthermore, 7 and 8R and R8 can bond simultaneously to form a compound of the following formula EMI28.1 wherein R10 and R11 are the same or different and each represent a hydrocarbon group .As the hydrocarbon groups represented by R10 and R11, use is made of those described for the above R1, and among others, frequent use may be made of lower alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl and isopropyl and further groups comprising 10 and R11 linked through a alkylene group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms. A compound of XVI where R10 and R11 both are methyl groups has been already described in the literature B.G. Christensen, et al. Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 45, pp. 1130 1980 , and is obtained by reacting 4 2 hydroxyethyl azetidin 2 one with 2,2 dimethoxypropane in the presence of an acid catalyst such as boron trifluoride etherate and p toluenesulfonic acid.Other compounds of XVI are easily obtained by employing ketones e.g., diethyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, diisopropyl ketone, cyclopropanone, cyclobutanone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, etc. in place of 2,2 dimethoxypropane in the above described reaction. It is preferable to use XVI in the subsequent reaction as the compound represented by the formula V . The first reaction step is the step where the 3 position of V is sulfenylated to give VI . In carrying out the reaction of this reaction step, 1 mole of V is preferably reacted with 1 mole of a sulfenylating agent, under the presence of 1 to 3 moles of a strong base such as lithium diisopropylamide, lithium isopropylcyclohexylamide, sodium amide and potassium amide, in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran THF , dimethoxyethane, ether, dimethylformamide DMF and dimethylsulfoxide DMSO at temperatures of 780C to 0 C to yield VI . As the sulfenylating agent, use can be made of disulfides such as those of the formula R9S 2, substituted thiosulfonates such as those of the formula R9S SO,R9, and N substituted thioimides such as those of the formulaEMI29.1 orEMI29.2 9. wherein R is as defined above .

The second reaction step is the step where the 3 position of VI is alkylated to produce VII . In carrying out the reaction of this step, 1 mole of VI is treated with 1 mole to 20 moles of a ketone at temperatures ranging from 780C to OOC, with use of the same strong base and solvent as employed in the first reaction step, to give VII . The above conversion reactions of V VI i VII can be accomplished, without isolation of VI , to effect the conversion of V VII indicated as the second prime reaction step in the above scheme in the same reaction vessel.In such case, V is treated at temperatures ranging from 780C to OOC, with use of the same strong base and solvent as employed in the first reaction step, and 1 mole of a sulfenylating agent per 1 mole of V is added, followed by addition of 1 mole to 20 moles of acetone, to produce VII . The amount of the strong base to be used is suitably 2 moles to 3 moles per 1 mole of V . It is theoretically possible that the resultant VII exists in two kinds of diastereomers relative to the substituent in the 3 position. In this reaction, these isomers can be isolated by the procedures such as column chromatography and recrystallization, and each of them can be used in the subsequent reaction, though they can be used, without being isolated, in the form of the mixture, in the subsequent reaction. The third reaction step is the step where VII is reduced to produce selectively 3,4 cis substituted azetidinone VIII . In carrying out the reaction of this reaction step, as the reducing agent, use is for example made of organic tin compounds, nickel compounds, mercury compounds, zinc compounds, etc., and the reaction is preferably conducted by useoforganotin compounds of the following formula R12 R22SnH2 or R12SnH SnH3, 2 2 or wherein R12 is a hydrocarbon group . As the hydrocarbon 12 group represented by R , use is made of those as mentioned for R1, and particularly, use can be made of lower alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, t butyl and n pentyl, phenyl and lower alkyl e.g., methyl, ethyl, etc. substituted phenyl groups.Specifically, use can be made of triphenyltin hydride, tri n butyltin hydride, diphenyltin hydride, din butyltin hydride, triethyltin hydride, trimethyltin hydride and n butyltin hydride, and particularly, the compounds such as triphenyltin hydride and tri n butyltin hydride are preferable. The reducing agent is employed normally in the proportions of 1 mole to 10 moles, preferably 1.2 to 5 moles, per 1 mole of VII . This reaction is suitably carried outinthe presence of 0.1 mole to 0.5 mole of a free radical initiator such as azobis isobutyronitrile or di t butyl peroxide. Also, light irradiation may be effected in place of the use of the free radical initiator.The reaction is normally carried out in a solvent not participating in the reaction, although the reducing agent itself may be used as solvent. As the solvent, use can be made of ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene, and others. The reaction temperature is normally 0 C to 1300C, especially suitably lO0C to 1OODC, and the reaction can be conducted in an atmosphere of inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, if necessary. The reaction time varies with the type of starting compounds, reaction temperature, used amount of a reducing agent, et, and is about 1 to 24 hours.This reaction can produce preferentially the objective compound VIII having the 3,4 cis configuration, but is accompanied with the production of a small amount of the by product compound having the 3,4 trans configuration. Isolation of VIII from the reaction mixture is effected in accordance with the conventional procedures. For example, VIII can be easily isolated by distilling off the solvent and subjecting the residue to recrystallization or column chromatography. The fourth reaction step is the step where the hydroxyl group present in VIII is protected to produce IX . As the protective group represented by R2, use is made of those described above, and protective groups capable of forming an ether linkage such as ss methoxyethyoxy methyl, methoxymethyl and methylthiomethyl groups are suitable. Out of these, especially, the groups such as ss methoxyethoxymethyl group are preferable as the protectivegroup for Viii . Reaction of introducing a protective group is accomplished by the known procedures, and the abovedescribed protective groups capable of forming an ether linkage are introduced, for example, by reacting an alkyl halide such as ss methoxyethoxymethyl chloride, methoxymethyl chloride and methylthiomethyl chloride with VIII under the presence of a base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, n butyllithium and sodium hydride, in a solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, THF, ether, dimethoxyethane, acetonitrile, DMF and DMSO at temperatures ranging from 200C to 1000C for 0.5 to 72 hours. The amount of the alkylating agent and base to be used vary with their types, starting compounds, sovent, reaction temperature, etc., and each are 1 mole to 20 moles, suitably 1 mole to 5 moles, per 1 mole of VIII . IX thus obtained can also be obtained from VII via XVII as shown by the following reaction scheme. EMI33.1 wherein the symbols in the formula are as defined above .In the above described reaction, the hydroxyl group of VII is in the first place protected to give XVII , and then reduction is effected to yield IX . The conversion from VII to XVII is accomplished by substantially the same procedure as in the conversion from VIII to IX .Also, the conversion from XVII to IX is achieved by the substantially the same procedure as in the conversion from VII to VIII . The fifth reaction step is the step where the protective groups, R and R8, for IX are removed to give X . Removal of the protective groups R7 and R8 is conducted by applying a variety of known procedures of removing protective groups, and in the case of IX being the compound derived from XI. , for example, the removal of the protective groups is carried out by the acid hydrolysis in a solvent such as aqueous acetic acid at temperatures of OOC to 750C for a reaction time of 5 minutes to 16 hours. The sixth reaction step is the step where the hydroxyethyl group of X is converted by oxidation reaction into the carboxymethyl group to produce XI . The oxidation reaction can be conducted by employing various known oxidation systems such as Jones reagent, potassium permanganate and silver oxide in a solvent such as acetone, aqueous THF and aqueous dioxane over the temperature range of 100C to 400C for 10 minutes to 24 hours. Particularly, it is preferable to subject X to an oxidation reaction with use of Jones reagent in a solvent such as acetone at a temperature of lO0C to 300C for 10 minutes to 8 hours. Or, alternatively, at first X is converted to a compound of the following formula EMI34.1 wherein the symbols are as defined above , which can then be converted into XI . The conversion from X to XVIII is effected by the oxidation with an oxidizing agent such as DMSO acetic anhydride, chromic anhydride pyridine and cyclohexylcarbodiimide DMSO in a solvent such as DMSO, pyridine, acetonitrile and dichloromethane at a temperature of about OOC to 400C. The conversion from XVIII to XI thus is accomplished by the substantially same procedure as in the above conversion from X to XI . XI can also be obtained by subjecting IX directly to an oxidation reaction indicated as the sixth prime reaction step inthescheme . In the case of IX being the compound derived from XVI , for example, XI is obtained by subjecting to the oxidation reaction with use of Jones reagent in a solvent such as acetone at a temperature of lO0C to 300C for 10 minutes to 8 hours. In this reaction, X is produced as an intermediate, and the oxidation reaction then proceeds. The objective compounds I of the present invention encompass each of the d , the R , and the dl forms, and although optically active I can be produced from optically active V , it is preferable to effect resolution with use of XI in the case of the dl form. Resolution can be conducted by the various known procedures. For example, such racemate d,Q mixture is resolved by crystallization, or fractional crystallization ofdiastereomers formed from XI and an optically active amine such as quinine, brucine, ephedrine, strychnine and morphine, and physical separation by means of chromatography, etc. The seventh reaction step is the step where the carboxyl group of XI is activated and the chain is extended by two carbons to produce XII . In carrying out the reaction of this reaction step, the reaction is conducted by firstly reacting 1 mole of XI with 1 to 2 moles of a reagent such as l,l carbonyldiimidazole or l,1 carbonylbis 2 methylimidazole in a solvent such as THF and dimethoxyethane at OOC to 500C to give imidazolide, and reacting the imidazolide without being isolated with 1 to 3 moles per 1 mole of XI of a magnesium salt of a malonic acid derivative of the following formula R OCOCH2COO 2Mg XIX wherein R is as defined above at 0 C to 50 C for 1 to 48 hours. The eighth reaction step is the step where XII is diazotized to XIII . The diazotization reaction is carried out by reacting 1 mole of XII with 1 to 2 moles of an azide such as p carboxybenzenesulfonyl azide, p toluenesulfonyl azide and methanesulfonyl azide in a solvent such as acetonitrile, dichloromethane and THF in the presence of.a base such as triethylamine, diethylamine and pyridine. The reaction temperature is 100C to 400C, and the reaction time is normally 1 to 48 hours. The nineth reaction step is the step where the protective group Rê in XIII is removed to produce XIV , and it is not essential to conduct the removal of the protective group in this reaction step in other words, such protective group, if it is pharmaceutically acceptable, may remain, and can be removed in any reaction step subsequent to this reaction step, if necessary. Such removal of the protective group is carried out by applying the various, known procedures of removing protective groups, and in the case of Rê being a ss methoxyethoxymethyl group, the removal is effected by contacting with a Lewis acid such as titanium tetrachloride and zinc bromide in a solvent such as chloroform, dichloromethane and THF.The amount of the Lewis acid to be used is 1 to 30 moles per 1 mole of XIII , and the reaction temperature is 100C to 400C, while the reaction time is 5 minutes to 10 hours. The tenth reaction step is the step where XIV is cyclised to produce XV . The cyclisation reaction is conducted by cyclising XIV insolvent such as benzene, toluene and THF in the presence of a catalyst such as copper sulfate, copper powder, rhodium acetate and palladium acetate. The reaction temperature is 500C to 1100C, while the reaction time is 1 to 5 hours, and the reaction is normally carried out in an atmosphere of inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. Also, this cyclisation reaction can be conducted by irradiating XIV with light in a solvent such as benzene, THF, carbon tetrachloride and diethyl ether at 10 C to 400C for 0.5 to 2 hours. The eleventh reaction step is the step where XV is activated with an activating agent to produce II . in the case of X in II being a substituted sulfonyloxy group, the reaction is conducted by reacting 1 mole of XV with 1 to 3 moles of a sulfonylating agent such as p toluenesulfonic acid anhydride, p nitrophenylsulfonic acid anhydride, 2,4 triisopropyl phenylsulfonic acid anhydride, methanesulfonic acid anhydride, p toluenesulfonic chloride and p bromophenylsulfonyl chloride in a solventsuch as dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane and THF in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine and 4 dimethylaminopyridine. Normally, the reaction temperature is 200C to 400C, and the reaction time is 0.5 to 5 hours.In the case of X in II being halogen, the reaction is carried out under the same conditions with use of a halogenating agent e.g., oxalyl chloride, C6H5 3PC12, C6H5 3PBr2, C6H5O 3PBr2, thionyl chloride, etc. in place of the sulfonylating agent employed in the reaction in the case of the above X being a substituted sulfonyloxy group, and thus, XV can be converted into II . In the case of X in II being a disubstituted phosphoryloxy group, also, the reaction is perfomed under the same conditions with use of a phosphorylating agent e.g., diphenyl chlorophosphate diphenylphosphoryl chloride , dimethyl chlorophosphate, diethyl chlorophosphate, etc. in place of the sulfonylating agent employed in the reaction in the case of the above X being a substituted sulfonyloxy group, and XV can be converted into II . After the completion of the reaction, the objective compound II of this reaction step is recovered from the reaction mixture by the conventional procedures. The compound, for example, can be obtained by adding to the reaction mixture an organic solvent immiscible with water such as ethyl acetate and water, separating a organic solvent layer to wash with water, drying with a drying agent and distilling off the solvent. Also, II can be subjected, without the above described isolation procedure, as such to the reaction in the subsequent reaction step. The above described example is not intended to limit the starting material II , and use can be maae of any starting compound II , if it is suited for the purpose of this invention.

Antibacterial spectra minimum inhibitory concentration of the test compounds are shown in theTable 1.Test Microorganism 1 5. aureus FDA 209P 2 S. aureus 308 A l 3 5. aureus 1840 4 E. coli NIHJ JC 2 5 E. coli 0 111 6 E. coli T 7 7 C. freundii IFO 12681 8 K. pneumoniae DT 9 E. cloacae IFO 12937 10 S. marcescens IFO 12648 11 P. vulgaris IFO 3988 12 . mirabilis IFO 3849 13 P. morganii IFO 3168 14 P. aeruginosa IFO 3455 15 P. aeruginosa U 31 16 A. calcoaceticus IFO 13006 Table 1 EMI125.1 Test SEP compound tb Example SEP No. SEP 67 tb Test SEP Isomer tb Microorganism SEP 49 SEP 51 SEP I SEP 46 SEP 2 SEP 26 SEP 47 SEP 33 SEP 20 tb SEP 1 SEP 0.2 SEP 0.2 SEP 3.13 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.39 tb SEP 2 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 3.13 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.39 tb SEP 3 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.78 SEP 6.25 SEP 0.78 SEP 1.56 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.78 tb SEP 4 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.78 SEP 1.56 SEP 0.39 SEP 1.56 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.78 tb SEP 5 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.39 SEP 0.2 tb SEP 6 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.78 SEP 1.56 SEP 0.78 SEP 1.56 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.78 SEP 0.78 SEP 3.13 tb SEP 7 SEP 3.13 SEP 3.13 SEP 3.13 SEP 1.56 SEP 3.13 SEP 3.13 SEP 1.56 SEP 3.13 SEP 0.78 tb SEP 8 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 12.5 SEP 25 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 0.78 tb SEP 9 SEP 12.5 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 12.5 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 1.56 tb 10 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 3.13 SEP 12.5 SEP 6.25 SEP 3.13 SEP 6.25 SEP 1.56 tb 11 SEP 100 SEP 25 SEP 25 SEP 25 SEP 50 SEP 50 SEP 25 SEP 50 SEP 3.13 tb 12 SEP 50 SEP 25 SEP 25 SEP 25 SEP 50 SEP 50 SEP 25 SEP 50 SEP 3.13 tb 13 SEP 50 SEP 25 SEP 50 SEP 25 SEP 50 SEP 50 SEP 25 SEP 50 SEP 3.13 tb 14 SEP 12.5 SEP 50 SEP 100 SEP 3.13 SEP 6.25 SEP 25 SEP 3.13 SEP 12.5 SEP 50 tb 15 SEP 50 SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 6.25 SEP 25 SEP 50 SEP 12.5 SEP 50 SEP 100 tb 16 SEP 12.5 SEP 25 SEP 12.5 SEP 6.36 SEP 3.13 SEP 12.5 SEP 6.25 SEP 3.13 SEP 12.5 tb
