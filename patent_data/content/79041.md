## Description
AUTOMOTIVE AIR FUEL RATIO CONTROL SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to an automotive air fuel ratio control system and more specifically to a system including an engine vibration sensor which provides real time information enabling the air fuel ratio to be held on the lean side of stoichimetry in the near vicinity of a so called best encomony point . Description of the Prior Art To permit an internal .combustion engine to be operated on fuels in which the ratio of gasoline to alcohol vary due to seasonal availabilty of alcohol such as occurs in Brazil for example wherein the percentage of alcohol is apt to vary between 20 and 50 or for other reasons such as an unexpected seperation of the fuel in the fuel tank per se into seperate alcohol and gasoline layers, it has been necessary to develop an air fuel ratio control system which can compensate for the rather remarkable changes in the equivalence ratio resulting from varying percentages of alcohol in the fuel. For example, if the engine carburetor for example is calibrated to produce an air fuel ratio of 15 1 when operated on gasoline containing from 0 20 alcohol the equivalence ratio will vary from 0.98 for pure gasoline to 0.90 when the fuel contains 20 alcohol .However, if the amount of alcohol increases to 50 the equivalence ratio falls to 0.78 which is too lean for stable engine operation and the carburetor must be recalibrated. Hence, a so called Lean Limit Control LLC system has been developed wherein the angular accelearation deceleration of the engine flywheel is detected and quality of combustion determined electronically. To acheive this detection a magnetic sensor has been mounted immediately adjacent the the engine flywheel and adapted to output signal indicative of the changes in the angular momentum of same. A full and detailed disclosure of this arrangement may be found in SAE Society of Automotive Engineers Inc TechnicalPaper No. 780039, the subject matter of which was made public at the Congress and Exposition Cobo Hall Detroit.Feburary 27 March 3, 1979. However, this arrangement has suffered from the drawback that the sensor disclosed in the above mentioned paper, is unable to provide the required indication of engine vibration. That is to say, in the case of an automotive internal combustion engine, the changes in angular momentum of the flyweel vary from between 0.025 and 0.04 of the total angular momentum whereby the circuitry associated with the sensor must be sufficiently sensitive so as to be able to distinguish the changes despite external influences such as background noise electronic which is inevitable in such an environment.Further, when the engine rolls on its suspension the sensor per se is apt rotate about the flywheel axis either in the same rotational direction as the flywheel or counter thereto and tend to induce erroneous momentum change indications. Moreover, changes in angular momentum are apt to not always indicate the notable engine vibrations which are apt to occur due to resonance frequencies of the engine and or associated structures which are greatly aggravated if the engine is running on a lean mixture.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an air fuel ratio control system which can a maintain the air fuel ratio of an internal combustion engine on the lean side of stoichiometric and on or about a so called best economy point , and b suppress annoying and or damaging vibrations whereby smooth and economical engine operation can be simultaneously achieved. The present invention accordingly features a sensor which senses the engine vibration directly and which outputs a signal indicative thereof to circuitry which upon detecting vibration in excess of a predetermined level, issues a relatively rapid air fuel mixture enrichment signal until the level of vibration falls below the predetermined level whereupon a relatively slow air fuel leaning signal is produced. Continuous repetition of the enrichment leaning signals causes the air fuel ratio to hunt back and forth over the best economy point . More specifically, the present invention takes the form of an internal combustion engine equipped with an air fuel ratio control system comprising, means for forming an air fuel mixture, a vibration sensor mounted on the body of the engine for directly sensing the vibration of the engine and outputting a signal indicative of the magnitude thereof, and a control circuit associated with the air fuel mixture forming means which circuit is responsive.to the signal so that upon the magnitude of the vibration exceeding a predetermined level, the control circuit enriches the air fuel mixture formed by the air fuel mixture means and leans the air fuel mixture when the magnitude is lower than the predetermined level.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The features and advantages of the arrangement of the present invention will become more clearly appreciated from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing the circuitry and wave forms produced therein by the control circuit shown in Fig. 1 Fig 3 is a chart showing in terms of air fuel ratio the corresponding variations in a engine vibration level, b engine stablity, c fuel ecomomy and d HC,CO and NO x emissions and Fig. 4 is a graph showing in terms of engine torque and either engine or vehicle speed, the torque characteristics of the engine and the zones in which the present invention may find suitable application.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Turning to Fig. 1 an embodiment of the present invention is shown in which an internal combustion engine 10 is equipped with an induction system 12 including an air flow meter 14, a throttle chamber 16 and throttle valve position sensor 18. The induction system 12 further includes a fuel injection system 20 comprised of a plurality of injectors 22, a fuel pump 24 which inducts fuel from a fuel tank 26 via a filter 28, a pressure regulator valve 30 and an injection control unit 32. As shown, the control unit 32 receives data inputs from the air flow meter 14, throttle position sensor 18, an engine distributor 34 and an engine vibration sensor 36 which is attached to the engine proper so as to be directly exposed to the vibration thereof.The engine is also equipped with an exhaust system 38 including an oxidizing type catalytic converter 40. Fig. 2 shows in block diagram form the injection control unit 32 shown in Fig. 1. In this arrangement the input from the vibration sensor 36 which may sense any one of engine acceleration, displacement or vibration frequency outputs a signal P which is fed to a low pass filter tri2. This circuit smooths the signal and outputs a signal Q to a compensation operation unit 44 which senses the peak value Qmax of signal Q and compares same with a predetermined value viz., slice level S . Upon the value of Qmax exceeding the slice level the comparison operation unit functions to generate a first rapid fuel enrichment command signal R1 in this instance a pulse width increment command signal of 10 per 0.2 sec. until the fuel being combusted in the engine becomes sufficiently rich to reduce the engine vibration to a level that the value of Qmax falls below the slice level S, whereupon a relatively slow mixture leaning signal R2 is produced in this instance a injection pulse width decrement signal of 10 per sec .The command signals R1 and R2 are fed to a injection pulse generating unit 116. This unit functions to determine the basic pulse width of the energization pulses fed to the fuel injectors 22 in view of inputs indicative of engine rotation speed RPM , air induction quantity, throttle valve position and engine coolant temperture temperature sensor not shown , and modify same under the influence of the command signals R1 and R2 . In Fig. 3 the air fuel ratio indicated by A is a critical one where engine vibration see curve a will rise to a level which will induce physical discomfort and the limit of engine stablity be reached see curveThat is to say, the major vibration componets under this condition will have frequencies of 400Hz or lower.However, as shown by the fuel consumption curve c , the best economy point B occurs at an air fuel ratio which is slightly less than that at which the critial point A occurs and at which the levels of HC, CO andNOx are acceptably low while the amount of oxygen 02 contained in the exhaust gases is sufficient to promote secondary oxidization of the HC and CO in the catalytic converter 110. Hence, it will be appreciated that by holding the air fuel ratio at point B through closed loop feedback control via sensing engine vibration, a total engine control system which enhances not only fuel economy and drivablity but reduces noxious emissions, may be realized. Under certain modes of engine operation, it is deemed advantageous but not necesarily preferable to override the command signals R1 and R2. For example, during acceleration or heavy load operation when large amounts of power are temporarily required, in order to achieve the desired rich mixture, it is necessary to temporarily disable the closed loop control. Thus, the control unit may be adapted via the incorporation of a micro computer or the like to enable the closed loop control only when the engine is operating within the hatched zone shown in Fig. 4 and disable same when large amounts of power are required such as for hill climbing etc such as occur above and to the right of the hatched area. It will also be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the plurality of fuel injectors 22 shown and disclosed but may extend to electronically controlled carburetors, single point fuel injection arrangements and the like. It will be further appreciated that the above disclosed arrangement may be operated on fuels containing relatively large percentages of alcohol without any need to modify the system in anyway. Viz., the system will automatically seek out and maintain the best economy point for the fuel the engine is being operated on.
