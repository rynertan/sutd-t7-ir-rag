# MAINS SIGNALLING NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A mains signaling network 1 for a mains power supply line 2 has a controller 10 that controls switching of appliances 3 to 6 connected to the supply line via respective nodes 30 to 60 . Each node has a switch 36 by which a code can be set for the node, the controller having a keyboard 11 for addressing the desired node. When a node receives a signal from the controller, the node generates a reply signal along the supply line 2 . The controller generates the signal for controlling the appliance after receipt of the reply signal. If the controller receives signals other than those initiated by the controller, it generates signals to prevent operation of the nodes. Signals from the controller 10 include a code identifying the controller followed by a code identifying a node, whereas reply signals from the nodes include a code identifying that node followed by a code identifying the controller.
