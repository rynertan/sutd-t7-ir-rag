# Process for forming a pattern of transparent conductive material.

## Abstract
A pattern 22 of transparent conductive material, such as tin oxide, is formed on a transparent vitreous substrate 10 using a polycrystalline material 12 such as cadmium or zinc sulfide, to mask the substrate sur face while depositing material forming the transparent conductive layer. The polycrystalline material and any overlying transparent conductive material are easily re moved by a chemical etch, leaving the desired pattern of transparent conductive material 22 adhering to the substrate. Two electrically conductive patterns 32, 37 Fig. 6 may be formed in intersecting relationship and isolated, one from the other. The degree of electrical connection between the two patterns will be a function of the resistance of the polycrystalline material 38 therebetween at points of crossing. In some instances, electro luminenscence may be obtained by selecting the proper crystalline material wherein an electrical display may be created by selectively energising crossing elec trical conductors.
