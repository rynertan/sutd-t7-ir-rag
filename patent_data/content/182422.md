# High breakdown voltage semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
The breakdown voltage of a p n junction 20 operated under reverse bias in at least one mode of operation of a se miconductor device is increased by providing at least one annular region 1 to 6 forming an auxiliary p n junction 21 to 26 within the spread of a depletion layer 30 from the re verse biased junction 20 . A passivating dielectric layer 18 with an overlying electrically resistive layer 28 ex tends over the semiconductor body surface between the ac tive device region 11 forming the p n junction 20 and a surrounding region 14 of the body portion located beyond the outer annular region 6 . The resistive layer 28 is con nected to these regions 11 and 14 but is insulated from the annular regions 1 to 6 by the dielectric layer 18 . A stabie high breakdown voltage can be obtained by providing the resistive layer 18 with conductive connection means 51 to 56 at the or each annular area which overlies the annular region s 1 to 6 . The conductive connection means 51 to 56 which may be for example annular metal areas or annu lar highly doped parts of the resistive layer 28 is more highly conductive than the resistance of adjacent parts 28 of the resistive layer 28 and provides an electrical connec tion between these adjacent parts so that a potential varia tion which corresponds approximately with that along the underlying semiconductor body surface including the an nular regions can be obtained along the resistive layer 28 .
