# Register for road maps and the like.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a register for road maps, maps with plans of towns and the like whereby the register is provided with a housing 1 on the outer side of which is arranged a survey map which is divided into marked compartments, whilst the housing contains detail maps on a larger scale than the survey map and corresponding to the marked compartments and whereby the register is furth ermore provided with control members 7 marked in a manner corresponding with that of the compartments of the survey map, each marked control member being coupled with the detail map concerned, the arrangement being such that when actuating a control member the associated detail map is brought into sight.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A register for road maps, maps with plans of towns and the like characterized in that the register is provided with a housing, on the outer side of which is arranged a survey map which is divided into marked compartments, whilst the housing contains detail maps on a larger scale than the survey map and corresponding to the marked compartments and in that the register is furthermore provided with control members marked in a manner corresponding with that of the compartments of the survey map, each manked control member being coupled with the detail map concerned, the arrangement being such that when actuating a control member the associated detail map is brought into sight. 2. A register as claimed in Claim 1 characterized in that at least one wall of the register is a double wall to form a space for receiving the survey map. 3. A register as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 characterized in that both the survey map and the detail maps are arranged in the register so as to be exchangeable. 4. A register as claimed in anyone of the preceding Claims characterized in that the detail maps can be slid out of the register. 5. A register as claimed in anyone of Claims 1 to 3 characterized in that the register is provided with a cover that can be tilted up, as the case may be, with one or more detail maps, whilst on the inner side of the cover and or on the backsides of each of the detail maps is printed a survey map.

## Description
Register for road maps and the like. The invention relates to a register for road maps, for plans of towns and the like. Road maps and town maps and the like are usually printed on large folding sheets. Such large sheets are inconvenient in use, the more so as frequently only a small part of the map concerned is of interest at a given instant, whereas the whole map has to be unfolded. Moreover, correct folding of such maps may give rise to difficulties so that the map is often folded in a wrong manner. By intensive use rents are likely to occur soon particularly at the folding edges so that after a short time such a map becomes unserviceable. Such maps are sometimes issued in the form of a book, each page of which shows part of a map, for example, of The Netherlands. Finding the desired part of the map is often difficult, whilst finding further parts associated with a given map part also printed on sheets may give rise to difficulties. According to the invention the register is provided with a housing, the outer side of which shows a survey map, which is divided into compartments having marks, whilst in the housing detail maps on a larger scale than the survey map and corresponding to the marked compartments are arranged, the register being furthermore provided with control members marked in the same way as the compartments of the survey map, each marked control member being coupled with the detail map concerned so that when a controlmember is actuated the associated detail map is brought into sight. It will be obvious that by using a register embodying the invention the desired detail map can be simply and readily put at the user s disposal, whilst the relationship between the detail map exposed and the other detail maps can always be easily found back on the survey map. It should be noted that such registers have been known for many years, for example, to be used as a telephone index or the like, as is apparent, for example from Dutch Patent Specifications 130,821 and 143,177 and Dutch Patent Applications 7205519, 7215597, 7311021 and 7317481. It will, therefore, be obvious that the structural design of the register may be different in nany ways without getting beyond the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Figure. The registers shown in the Figure comprises a housing 1, in which a drawer 2 is adapted to slide. In the position shown the drawer is slipped as far as possible into the housing. The top surface 3 of the housing has, in the embodiment shown, a double walled structure and the top wall II of the double walled top surface has a slot not shown for inserting a map between the two walls of the double wall 3 spaced apart by a short distance and extending parallel to one another. The top wall of the double wall 3 shown in the Figure is made from transparent material so that the survey map slipped in will be clearly visible. In the embodiment shown the transparent top wall has marking lines 5 and 6 in dots, which are at right angles to one another and thus divide the top surface and hence the subjacent survey map into a plurality of compartments. The compartments are marked, for example, by characters A to L. The drawer contains a plurality of detail maps, each of which corresponds to one of the compartments A to L of the survey map drawn on a reduced scale located in the double wall. From Fig. 2 it will furthermore be apparent that the drawer is provided with a plurality of control keys 7. Each control key 7 is provided with a mark corresponding with one of the marks A to L or a similar mark may be provided at each key on the drawer 2. If it is desired to have the detail map corresponding to the compartment E of the survey map, only the button 7 having the mark E need be depressed, after which the drawer 2 is drawn out, the detail map concerned corresponding to compartment E then becoming visible on the drawn out drawer. The structural design of a mechanism carrying out the selection of the desired map is taught in one of the above mentioned publications.From these publications it will be apparent that instead of having a drawer the register may have a tiltable cover without passing beyond the spirit and scope of the invention. In the latter case part of the detail maps will tilt up together with the cover. On the batiside of each detail map and on the inner side of the cover is preferably printed a survey map so that like in the embodiment described above the survey map and a detail map can always be simultaneously consulted. As a matter of course, it is possible to use other mechanisms than those described an illustrated in the above mentioned publications for moving the selected detail map into view. Preferably the detail maps are arranged in the register so as to be readily exhangeable so that both the survey map and the detail maps can be exchanged in accordance with the region or town visited by the user of the register. If exchangeability is not required, the register may be constructed without the double top wall and the survey map may be housed in the top wall so as to be enclosed on all sides by the material of the top wall or it may be stuck to the top side of said wall. The survey map and the associated detail maps may display a given country, a given district of a country or, for example the plan of a town or the like. Instead of being printed on the cover, the marking lines may be printed directly on the map. Within the spirit and scope of the invention many variations of the embodiment described above and schematically shown may be made. The figures used in the claims are only meant to explain mcre clearly the intention of the invention and are not supposed to be any restriction concerning the interpretation of the invention.
