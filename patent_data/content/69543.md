# PIPE INSULATION SLEEVE, A METHOD OF MAKING SAME, AND ARRANGEMENT FOR CARRYING OUT THE METHOD

## Abstract
The invention relates to a pipe insulation sleeve made of mineral wool bound by a thermosetting binder and compris ing an outer insulating layer 1 consisting of a slab of mineral wool hardened all through, said outer layer 1 featuring a number of radial slits 2 taken out from its inwards turned surface, which slits 2 run axially and are essentially closed and originally of V shaped form, and an inner layer 3 of mineral wool bonded to said outer layer by a thermosetting binder and of such thickness and density that it is in itself rigid and at the same time imparts rigidity to said outer layer. A method and arrangement for production of the pipe insulation sleeve is also described.
