# Low voltage fluorescent lamp operating circuit.

## Abstract
A circuit for starting and operating a low voltage floures cent lamp 10 from a 120 volt AC supply 12, 14 . The circuit includes a choke type ballast 26 connected in series with the lamp and inductively coupled to a pulse train generator com prising an RC energy storage circuit 30 connected across the line and a voltage sensitive transistorized relaxation oscillator 36 having a divider network for sensing lamp voltage. In a preferred embodiment, the circuit is employed in a preheat mode of operation in combination with an electronic starter 16 circuit comprising a PTC resistor 64 , a silicon diode 62 and SCR 60 series connected across the lamp.
