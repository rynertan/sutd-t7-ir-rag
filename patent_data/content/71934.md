# Method for preparing a color stable chromogenic analytical element.

## Abstract
Analytical element method of making the analytical element and process for determining an analyte in a body fluid sample are disclosed. More particularly, the method of preparing the element comprises the steps of a impregnating a carrier with a first solution, having a pH not greater than about 2.5, which comprises a polymeric mordant and a tetraalkylbenzidine dihydro chloride, in a molar concentration greater than that of the polymeric mordant in an aqueous solvent and drying the carrier b impregnating the carrier of a with a solution, having a pH of at least about 7.0, which com prises an analyte responsive component in an aqueous solvent and drying the carrier. Optionally, there can be added the step of impregnating the carrier of b with a solution of a semi permeable polymer in an organic solvent and drying the carrier.
