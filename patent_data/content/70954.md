# SCREENING DEVICE FOR SUN RAYS WITH CHANGING POSITIONING AND ORIENTATING

## Abstract
The patent foresees the stationing in a pleasant position, on the car top by means of transversal guides that can be made integral with it, of an emplacement bearing in the centre a parasol by means of coupling. By changing the position of the guides on the car top and of the emplacement on them, the most agreable positioning of the parasol can be obtained. The sunshade stem forsees an articulated joint immedi ately above the coupling part, permitting thus to change the parasol orientation. By adjusting in this way the emplace ment positioning and the stem orienting, the adjustment of the device is obtained to the contingent employ require ments. In order to get the composition of the stem integral with the emplacement in the wished position, the coupling axial cylinder forsees, on the circumference, a spaced set of bore couples which, laid on the portable diameters in position by rotation, separately correspond with a couple of bores on the coaxial to insert, permitting in this way to introduce a locking means by clamping.
