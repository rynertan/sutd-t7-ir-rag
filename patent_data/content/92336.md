# Adhesive compositions.

## Abstract
A method of making a one part, spreadable, adhesive composition comprises i forming the reaction product at a room temperature below 130 DEG C of an epoxy resin, a functional group terminated butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer elastomer, a chain extender and a catalyst for the reactions between the epoxy and functional groups, ii cooling the reaction product, and then iii combining the reaction product with a hardener, providing that in step ii the product is cooled to a temperature at which there will be substantially no reaction when combined with the hardener. The resulting adhesive composition has a reasonable storage life as it is substantially noncurable at room temperature, a temperature of at least 130 DEG C usually being required to convert it to an infusible state. In addition the adhesive composition is usually curable to a product having a high impact modulus i.e. a non brittle product.

## Description
ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to a method of making a one part, spreadable, adhesive composition, to the adhesive resulting therefrom and to a method of bonding involving use of the adhesive. Adhesive compositions based upon epoxy resin elastomer hardener reaction products are known. These compositions are usually either two part a adhesives in which the hardener is added to the remaining components immediately prior to the adhesive being required, or they are one part film adhesives which are solid at room temperature. The disadvantages of the former type are that the adhesive cannot be prepared beforehand and that any unused adhesive is wasted as it cannot be stored. The disadvantage of the latter type is the need for protecting the tape surfaces in storage and the difficulty in removing such protection prior to tape application. The object of the present invention is to provide an adhesive composition which is of the one part type, is spreadable at 2O0C, has a reasonable storage life stability and cures not at room temperature but at an elevated temperature to a product having a high impact resistance i.e. not brittle. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a one part adhesive composition which is substantially stable and 0 Ã§spreadable at 20 C and comprises i the reaction product of an epoxy resin, a functional group terminated butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer elastomer, a chain extender and a catalyst for the reactions between the epoxy and functional groups, and ii a hardener for component i . According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided an infusible product obtained by heating the composition of the immediately preceding paragraph to a temperature at or above 1300C. Where no accelerator e.g. 2 ethyl 4 methyl imidazole for the hardener is included in the composition a temperature at or above 1500C may be required. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of making a one part adhesive composition which is substantially stable and spreadable at 200C which comprises i forming at a temperature below 1300C the reaction product of an epoxy resin, a functional group terminated butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer elastomer, a chain extender and a catalyst for the reaction between the epoxy and functional groups, ii cooling the reaction product, and then iii combining the cooled reaction product with a hardener, provided that in step ii the reaction product is cooled to a temperature at which there will be substantially no reaction when combined with the hardener. The reaction time of step i ,.the so called pre reaction resulting in the pre reaction product, is preferably 45 minutes or less and will depend upon various factors including the temperature which is preferably from 1100C to 12500. At a reaction temperature of 1200C, the reaction time is preferably in the range 15 to 30 minutes, more preferably around 20 minutes. Preferably the viscosity of the pre reaction product is from 14000 to 30,000 poise i.e. from 1400 to 3000 Ns m2 and has an epoxy equivalent from 300 to 500. Any epoxy resin may be employed but a preferred class consists of the liquid resins which are the diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2,2 propane , and have an epoxy molar mass of from 160 to 220. The functional group in the butadiene acrylonitrile elastomer may be hydroxy or amino but is preferably carboxy. Preferably the functionality of the elastomer is in the range 1.5 to 2.3, more preferably 1.5 to 2.0, the functional groups being substantially only at the ends of the molecules, i.e. terminal groups, rather than terminal and pendant groups. Preferably the elastomer is liquid at 200C and has an acrylonitrile content of 22 to 27 by weight. Preferably the amount of elastomer is from 5 to 20 parts by weight based upon 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin. By chain extender is meant a bifunctional compound capable of reacting with the terminal epoxy groups of the liquid resin and a preferred class is that of the dihydroxy phenols e.g. 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenol propane, resorcinol or hydroquinone. Preferably the amount of chain extender is from 10 to 30 parts by weight based upon 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin. By hardener is meant a polyfunctional compound which will react with the epoxy resin to form a cross linked structure and a preferred example is dicyandiamide. Other examples include aromatic diamines, melamine, acid anhydrides and organic complexes of boron trifluoride. The amount of hardener preferred is dependent on its type. For dicyandiamide from 3.4 to 10 parts by weight based upon 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin are preferred. Preferably the catalyst employed is triphenyl phosphine, usually in an amount from 0.05 to 3 parts by weight based upon 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin. Other examples include the tertiary amines. One or more additional components of the adhesive composition may be selected from the following an inorganic filler which may be a particulate metal e.g. aluminium powder which may function as a thermal conductor and or to reduce the coefficient of expansion, an accelerator e.g. 2 ethyl 4 methyl imidazole a thixotropic agent e.g. silica , and a solid, uniformly sized particulate material e.g. glass beads to give regularity to the thickness of the adhesive forming the bond i.e. the glue line. The additional component or components may conveniently be incorporated into the pre reaction product. One way of preparing the adhesive composition of the present invention is to heat the epoxy resin with the chain extender to produce a homogeneous liquid and then to combine this homogeneous liquid with the functional group terminated butadiene acryloni trile copolymer elastomer and the catalyst. The butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer elastomer, with or without the catalyst, may be heated so as to be at a temperature 0 of 120 C or less upon combination with the epoxy resin. The epoxy resin and preferably butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer elastomer are liquid at 200C so as to allow the possibility of producing an adhesive composition which is a substantially solvent free viscous paste capable of being trowelled or extruded. The adhesive compositions of the present invention may have many uses including bonding metal to metal, plastics to plastics and metal to plastics. Compositions may be designed within the scope of the invention so as to be substantially non flowable at 0 20 C i.e. when applied to a surface they will remain there. So called structural adhesive compositions may be prepared within the scope of the invention i.e. load bearing, impact resistant compositions which are preferably also resistant to extremes of temperature, variations in humidity and environmental degradation such as chemical attack. Various embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in the following Example I in which all parts are by weight. EXAMPLE I The following reaction product A was prepared as described below.

Component d was then added and the mixture maintained 0 at 120 C for 20 minutes while stirring continued. The mixture was then discharged from the reactor and cooled rapidly to room temperature.

Tensile lap shear specimens were prepared in this way, were cured by heating for 0 30 minutes at 180 C and then tested under i the usual slow separation and ii high impact rate. The force per area required to cause bond failure under i was 30 MPa and the energy absorbed in breaking the bond under ii was 14 kJ m2 respectively. Omission of the aluminium powder did not affect either bond strength.

Bond failure kJ m2 occurred at 20 MPa and 8 kJ m2 respectively.
