# Apparatus and method of processing photopolymer printing plates.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for processing flat photopolymer printing plates economically allows combined brushing and solvent action whilst overcoming the problems of loss of expensive and potentially hazardous volatile solvents and uneven action over the surface area of the treated plate. Plates to be processed are held vertically on plate holders 11, 12 in solvent containers 30, 31 adjacent brushes carried by a pliable sheet with springs 27 providing a substantially uniform pressure against the sheet and hence against the surface of the plates. The plates mounted on holders 11, 12 are moved vertically up and down by the action of a piston rod 9 and pneumatic ram 4 . The uniform pressure against the pliable sheet may alternatively be provided by a sac of fluid either open to a reservoir or closed and biassed against the sheet by springs. The surface area of the solvent in containers 30, 31 is relatively small and remote from the brushing agitation so that a sealing fluid can be floated on the solvent surface preventing evaporation. In addition the brushing under substantially uniform pressure results in efficient washing in the minimum time.
