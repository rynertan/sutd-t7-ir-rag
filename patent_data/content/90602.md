## Description
TITLE Racking Mechanism for Control Drums for Circular KnittingMachinesDESCRIPTION Field of inventionThe invention relates to racking mechanisms for control drums of circular knitting machines and in particular sock knitting machines.Background of inventionA wide variety of control drum racking mechanisms is known Scott Williams British Patent Specification 651,833 Wildt British Patent Specification 789,827 OMC Italian Patent Specification 658,538 Merz est German Patent Specification 1,162,024 Bentley BritishPatent Specification 1,094,924 Lonati Italian PatentSpecification 909,716 Bentley British PatentSpecification 1,543,043 and Lonati British PatentSpecification 2,021,157. These mechanisms are of varying complexity and flexibility in providing racking motions for advancing the control drum. Many mechanisms have rack selectors in the form of pins, cams, or plates which nullify certain racking strokes.Generally, a control chain activates the control drum racking mechanism The starting of racking can be delayed or timed on simple meWr.isms by timing the racking pawl advance. On more complicated mechanims special arrangements have to be made to enable the start of racking to be timed particuAarly where a plurality of pawl strokes are available for each activation. In the British Patent Specification 1,094,924 for example, a further mechanism may be provided as described in theBritish Patent Specification 1,040,564 in addition to the rack selection mechanism to delay the start of racking.Amongst the objectives of the invention is to provide a reliable, simple and flexible racking mechanism where activation periods can be timed simply.Summary of inventionThe invention uses special selectors which move generally with the racking member and are associated wiht a particular rackwheel tooth but which can move with respect to the rackwheel over a limited distance. Other selectors may be present which are entirely fixed with respect to the rackwheel. At the position of the pawls, a selector control means can operate, when required, for movement of the selectors from a selecting position to a non selecting position. The selector control means can be timed from a racking period actuating means, generally a control chain, to initiate racking. A number of benefits may result.The rack selectors can be used to terminate racking and can be removed, without budging the rackwheel, to start racking. The operation of the selector control means times the start of the racking period. The removal of the selectors makes selection more secure as feelers for controlling the pawls can sense the absence of the selectors between two other selectors spaced by the distance of two rackwheel tooth repeat distances. The mechanism can be modified to provide varying degrees of complexity within a single cylinder revolution period.The term rack selectors1, is used in a wide sense and refers to control elements whose presence or absence control which racks are taken and which not. The rack selectors may act by bluffing certain pawls and certain strokes thereof during a racking sequence initiated by the actuating means.As far as the applicant is aware no prior art mechanism uses rack selectors which can be moved a limited distaw re to free the pawl s for operation but which otherwise travel with the rackwheel. The required mobility may be provided in a variety of ways each with associated advantages.In a first form of the invention the rack selectors are individually movable. The selectors may be mounted pivotably or slid ably. In this 7ass the selector control means may prop up the rack selectors and withdrawal of the control means causes the rack selectors to drop to permit racking to start This form of selector control means may have cam faces for raising the selectors to the propped operative selecting position.Advantageously then the working end of the rack selectors is arranged to move at an angle to a radius of the rack wheel so that its is raised travelling substantially at right angles to the cam faces. This is most conveniently achieved with a slidable selector arrangement.Such individually movable selectors may be interspersed with non movable selectors which may be in the form of a fixed pin or in the form of a slidable or pivatable selector but secured against pivoting or sliding as the case may be. The non movable selectors nullify individual pawl strokes during a racking sequence but are not responsible for restarting. Alternatively all selectors may be individually movable but the selectors may have different shapes to ensure that only some can be unpropped so to start racking others being merely unpropped as a result of a racking wheel advancement imparted by a pawl. Thus all selectors are cammed radially outward providing an active lifting of the feelers.Using such a mixture of selectors, individual pawl strokes may be bluffed and racking sequences terminated at any stage with either one of a pair of alternating pawls being capable of restarting.In a second embodiment of the invention the rack selectors are mounted on a ring concentric with the rackwheel which is urged resiliently to its operative position in which all selectors are in the selecting position but which can be nudged away from it by a limited distance into a non selecting position using the selector control means. All rack selectors are hence moved on when the ring is nudged. Selectors adapted to engage the selector control means may be interspersed with other selectors for bluffing strokes during a sequence. For example certain rack selectors may be enlarged so that only they will be nudged by the control means to release the associated pawl. If a number of pawls is used, a separately movable ring may be associated with each pawl.The rings may be drilled in pre determined positions to suit the rack selector lay out or program for a particular type machine. The program may be altered with ease.The shoggable ring can be incorporated in a variety of ways. The movable ring arrangement is solid but the timing of the bluffing action may be more critical than where rack selectors are individually movable. Again individual strokes can be bluffed and sequences ended at any stage.The mechanism aspects described previously can be complemented if required in different ways.Advantageously a cam operates the selector control means in synchronism with a pawl drive means once during a plurality of successive pawl strokes, rack selector movement thus occurring with predetermined timing during the succession of pawl strokes. Suitably the selector control means includes a follower operated by the cam having a cam following end and a working end, a selector operating device engageable by the follower and acting on the rack selectors for movement control, the working end being operable from the actuating means to cause the follower to engage the selector operating device. The cam permits restarting to be timed accurately following the arrival of a control chain stud under its follower. The control chain stud may also release a latching mechanism to reduce wear. Half studs could be used to postpone the commencement of racking. This can be achieved by advancing the follower twice in an activation period corresponding to the time required for the passage of a full length stud but safety of operation against misplacement of studs should be considered.Similarly a pair of followers are provided to be operated with different timing, their working ends being jointly operable from the actuating means to enable racking to restart at different times following activation. This would permit racking specifically during a first and second cylinder revolution. In this case the rackwheel may carry separate selectors to operate baulk members which prevent cam follower operation except during the intended part of the activation period to ensure safety.In any event it is desirable that a full, flexible choice of pawl strokes is possible during the first cylinder revolution equivalent to four pawl strokes of a two cylinder revolution period as this permits a large number of control drum racking programs to be executed with no unwanted racks dictated by the limitations of the racking mechanism. The necessary effect can be achieved by central slide which can bluff pawls on each side for the first and second stroke during a four stroke period. This, in combination with the movable selectors, permits a racking sequence to start with the first, second, third or fourth racking stroke.In the last mentioned case, the control slide would bluff the first and second stroke the third stroke would be bluffed by a normal selector and the fourth stroke would start then be applied to L racsuheel as the control means has made preparation to release the pawl earlier, before the first stroke.DrawingsFigure 1 shows a side view of a racking mechanism for a control drum, according to the invention Figure 2 shows a radial section along line II II ofFigure 1 Figure 3 shows a section similar to Figure 2 but having a modified rack selecting mechanism Figure 4 shows a view from above of a camming member of the mechanism of Figure 3 Figures 5 and 6 shows a side view and top view respectively of another modified rack selecting mechanism Figure 7 shows a perspective schematic view of yet another racking mechanism according to the invention Figure 8 shows a radial section of the mechanism ofFigure 7 andFigure 9 shows a detailed side view of a ring for the mechanism of Figure 7.Specific descriptionBefore detailing the specific means with which the invention can be performed, first common overall constructional features will be explained.With reference particularly to Figures 1 and 2, a rackirg mechanism 2 for a double cylinder sock knitting machine has an actuating means with an incrementally advanced control chain 4 passing over a sprocket 6 and carrying studs 8 for engaging a control chain follower 10. The sprocket 6 and the rackwheels and control drum later referred to rotate about axis 12. The follower 10 controls a slidable cam follower 14, which engages a single lobed cam 16 on a main can shaft 17 at its rear end, by raising or lowering a front output end 20 of the follower 14. A further such cam follower 13 may be provided and is shown for some embodiments only but its associated cam 15 has a single lobe offset from the lobe on the cam 16. The cam follower s function together with the chain 4 in activating racking pawls.Pawls may additionally be latched when racking is not required to reduce wear. The control chain follower 10 can operate hooks 20, 21 engaging the pawls at the forward extreme end of their motion. The hooks 20, 21 are biassed to engage the pawls by springs 22. When the follower 10 is lifted by a stud 8, the link rod 24 pulls the hooks 20, 21 out of engagement permitting activation by the cam follower s 13, 14 to take effect.The racking mechanism further includes the pawls 26, 28 operated by four lobed cams 30, 32 on the shaft 17 to reciprocate alternately and advance the control drum by one or more of successive forward strokes. The pawls 26, 28 can engage evenly cut rackwheels 34, 36 which are coupled together. Once activated and released, pawls operation is selectively controlled by selectors . The details will be discussed when dealing with the various specific means with which the invention can be performed.However each pawl can be bluffed by separate feelers 40, 42 and optionally a central slide 44 which acts on both pawls once raised by a centrally located slide selector 46 through a feeler 47. The slide 44 is advanced by a two lobed cam 48.All followers, pawls and the slide are spring biassed for return movement.The timing of the various follower and slide movements can be derived from the cam profiles shown. The cam shaft 17 revolves gernerally once every two cylinder revolutions. The control chain 4 is advanced in two steps spaced by one cylinder revolution so that a full length stud passes the control chain follower in a period also corresponding with two cylinder revolutions.Half length studs may be used, but proper care is to be taken that the wrong placement of a half stud occupying one half of the length of a link in the chain 4 does not cause unacceptable damage. Using half studs activation of the pawls 26, 28 can be restricted to a single cylinder revolution. Where the two cam followers 13 and 14 are used each advances to activate for a specific one of two successive cylinder revolutions to cooperate with appropriate full or half length studs.The effect of wrongly placed half studs can be negated by use of the levers 50, 52 which can hold the front output end 20 lifted if an appropriate pin 53 is placed to rotate with the rackwheels 34, 36 and so baulk activation by that particular cam follower 13, 14. The mechanism would thus fail to continue to rack and the operatives attention would be drawn to wrong half stud placement. In any event, the pawls 26, 28 would be unlatched by any latching hooks 20, 21 as a stud 8 arrives under the follower 10. Subsequent events will be explained in connection with the specific means for performing the invention.Figure 1 and 2Here each rackwheel 34, 36 has a ring 54, 56 associated carrying selector pins 58 or pivotable devices 60 carried on pivot pins 60.The pins 58 engage the feelers 40, 42 unfailingly and have th same action as known from the prior art, bluffing out certain pawl strokes during a sequence ie after it has been started in some other way.The devices 60 are controlled by a selector control means 62 having a camming member 64 with sideways projecting ends 66 with cam faces 65 carried by a pivot pin at 67 on a lever 68 pivoted at 70. The lever 68 is engagable by the followers 13, 14 and, when this happens, the ends 66 withdraw.Thus when a sequence is about to end, a projecting part 72 of the device on one rackwheel is cammed radially outward by the ends 66 see right hand device in Figure 1 bluffing the pawl for one rackwheel. A pin is present for bluffing the pawl on the other rackwheel. Both pawls being bluffed, the activation period can end by relatching the pawls as the follower 10 drops off the stud 8. As the next stud comes under the follower 10, the pawls are unlatched, the output end 20 of the appropriate cam follower is lowered and after a desired delay the cam follower nudges the lever 68. Withdrawal of the ends 66 causes the projecting part 72 to drop off see left hand device in Figure 1 and one pawl to be lowered or to be prepared for lowering so that when the apporpiate pawl advances and no other bluffing means are present ie slide 44 rakcing can restart.The slide 44 senses for the.presence of a selector 46 and can postpone the starting of racking at least until each of the pawls 26 and 28 has performed one stroke.As illustrated racking could start with any one of the first four strokes. The selectors 46 are mounting in a ring 74 passing between the ends 66 mounted on a further ring 86 spacing the rings 54, 56.Figure 3 and 4This arrangement resembles that the previous Figures. The slide 44 is omitted. No fixed pins 58 are used.Instead pivotable devices 60 are given a projection 88 for riding over a flange 90 of a mounting ring 92 to provide a fixed bluffing e lement equivalent to the pi ns 58. Manufacture is simplified.Figures 5 and 6This arrangement resembles that of Figures 3 and 4 but may incorporatet the slide 44. A spoked member 94 is clamped against each rackwheel 34, 36 and provided slots 96 in which rack selectors 98 may slide at an angle to a radius. The selectors 98 have widened bottom ends for retention in the slots 96.All selectors are slidable and are cammed radially outwards by the ends 66, lifting the feelers 40, 42 in so doing. The camming surfaces on the ends are indented thus presenting extended support surfaces 97.Long selectors 98 will remain under the feelers 40, 42 for the maximum duration and only drop off when the rackwheels 34, 36 are moved sufficiently forward. These are the equivalents of the fixed pins 58 for bluffing strokes during a sequence. Other selectors 98 are short and pass over a shorter cam surface on the ends 66.These selectors 98 drop of i the ends 66 as the camming member is withdrawn by the advancing cam follower 14 so as to permit the associated paw to restart racking.The short selectors can drop off at a set delay after the chain stud has arrived under the follower to prime the appropriate pawl for action.In this case, a latching mechanism is omitted as is the second cam follower 13.The mechanism provides a smooth action for the camming of the selectors 98, the lifting of the feelers and the removal of the short selectors 98 from the camming member 64.Figures 7, 8 and 9This arrangement uses a fixed ring 99 for the central slide 44 and two cam followers 13 and 14. Movable rings surrounding the rackwheel 100 and 102 mount short 104 and long pins 106 fixed to the rings 100, 102. The short pins 104 bluff in the course of a sequence. The long pins 106 can be engaged by selector control means in the form of a forked member 108 which is pushed forward by either of the followers 13 and 14. The rings 100 and 102 are spring 109 biassed to the operative selecting position by a spring interconnecting the rings 100 and 102 and the assciated rack wheels 34, 36 seeFigure 9 . At the end of sequence both pawls 26, 28 will be bluffed, one by a short pin and one by a long pin.When the next chain stud arrives under the follower, the appropriate follower 13 or 14 will advance the forked member 108 after an appropriate delay. One end 110 or 112 will engage the long pin and move the associated ring onwards, causing the feeler 40 or 42 to fall of that pin to permit the associated pawl to restart racking. The forked member 108 can pivot about shaft 113 through slots 114 therethrough to permit long pins to advance to a position in front of the forked member 108 for operation. Figure 7 illustrates the use of baulking levers similar to those used for the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1 and 2.SummaryThe various specific pawl restarting and selecting means described thus permit racking to restart by moving one selector out of its selecting position to a non selecting position, priming one of the pawls for action but without moving the rackwheel. The noses of the feelers 40, 42 hence provide racking by dropping between two selectors which are spaced by a distance of at least two rack wheel pitches so permitting the pawl to engage the rackwheel with considerable reliability.
