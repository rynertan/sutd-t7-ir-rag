## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN CONFECTIONERY ARTICLESAND METHODS OF MANUFACTURING THEM This invention relates to improvements in confectionery articles and methods of manufacturing them and in apparatus therefor. In particular example it relates to the production of frozen confections which have relief features or complex shapes, for example ice confections which have been produced in sculptured moulds. Various methods for producing such products with eye appealing features of shape and configuration, eg relief or complex shapes are known, for example fromGB Patent Specification Nos. 698 814 Randall and 1 025 383 Oldham . GB Specification No. 1 508 589 Unilever describes a more recent method, which has been put into commercial use. Among the aesthetic or eye appealing complex shapes that can be produced by such methods in frozen confection form are forms of human, humanoid or animal like figures and parts thereof, figures of model aeroplanes, cars, boats, etc, among many possible designs. Other methods are also known for producing frozen confection forms with interesting attractive appearances given by surface marked designs, eg stencil spraying, as described in GB Specification No. 2 018 198 Unilever . It is however found that it is hard to print or spray accurately on to frozen edible products with relief features, and such accuracy would normally be desirable because the printed or sprayed matter would usually need to be related to the design formed by the relief features. According to the present invention, contrast of colour or tone is given to different parts of a confectionery articles having surface relief features, by applying to the article a coating of solidifiable material which adheres to the article with sufficiently uneven thickness, and which has a colour or brightness tone of sufficient depth, and of sufficient contrast with the brightness or tone of the uncoated article, that on solidification the coated material forms areas of contrasting colour or tone. Accordingly, the invention provides an improvement in the process of applying visual pattern or design to an ice confectionery article which comprises applying to the surface of the ice confectionery article a decoration material with a tone or brightness which contrasts with the tone or brightness of the material of which the ice confectionery article is made, the pattern or design being formed by the pattern or design of the distribution of various amounts of the decoration material on the surface of the ice confectionery article, the improvement being characterised in that the decoration material is applied as an overall coating of solidifiable material to an ice confectionery article with surface relief features such as projections and concavities, and in that the solidifiable decoration material is made to adhere to the confectionery article with uneven thickness, and made to solidify to form decorated areas of contrasting tone or brightness, with concavities of the article containing thick coatings of the decoration material to show the characteristic colour or brightness of the decoration material, and the projections of the article bearing thinner contrasting coatings. Confection products according to the invention can bear concave features of surface relief having therein preferentially thick accretions of coating materials giving colour and or brightness contrast with other areas of the products. For example, the coating thickness can be thick enough in concavities of the surface relief of the article to give such concavities substantially the colour or tone of the coating material itself, while in other areas the coating thickness is thin enough to leave a contrasting colour or tone, eg a colour or tone substantially similar to that of the uncoated article, ie the coating on such other areas can be substantially colourless and transparent. The coating material can for example be applied by dipping the article in a bath of flowable coating material or by spraying the coating material on, eg from a directional spray. The coating material can have any of a number of combinations of colour or tonal intensity, viscosity, and temperature of application, to ensure the described contrasty result when it is applied by the chosen method. For example, aqueous coating materials can be applied to frozen confectionery articles by dipping the articles into the liquid coating materials, and allowing excess coating material to drain and the remainder to freeze on to the article. It has been found that contrasting features of colour or tone can be easily and accurately located by this method in desired association with relief features of an ice confection of complex, eg moulded, eye appealing shape, without the need to bring apparatus for applying such an uneven coating into precise registration with such features. For example, referring to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, an ice lolly 1 on a stick shown in plan in Figure 1 can be made to a design in the form of an animal figure 2 with surface texture representing, for example, eyes 3, locks of fur, buttons 4, etc, by the method described in GB Patent Specification No. 1 508 589 using a mould of appropriate design, or otherwise.A desirable colour contrast can be applied by for example first having the body of the lolly frozen from a confection containing mix of conventional type and for example a pale, eg yellow, edible colour using a permitted colouring material, and then dipping the frozen lolly in an aqueous coating material coloured by, for example, about 1 2 by weight of ordinary brown coloured caramel and for example up to about 10 total sugar content, or else coloured by eg 0.1 0.2 of a permitted colouring material of intense colour, eg of red, blue or green colour. When the aqueous colour coating material is at about 150C and the ice lollies are at about 180C to 200C for example, and the dipping is done for example for a fraction of a second, it is found that the smooth parts eg 5 of the lolly referring to Figure 2, a diagrammatic section on line IT IT in Figure 1 retain only a thickness of for example about 0.1 to 0.14 mm of solidified frozen coating material, insufficient to impart deep coloration, while concavities eg 6, 7 acquire thicker coatings, eg above about 0.5 mm and up to about 1 5 mm thick, having a deep brown, red, blue or green coloration for example, in striking visual contrast to the eg predominantly pale yellow colour of the remainder of the lolly. Appropriate areas of desired colour or tone contrast can of course be arranged by suitable design for the shape of the lolly to be differentially coated. Concavities can be of for example rectangular or triangular transverse section or irregular other forms capable of retaining a desired thickness of for example about 1 5 mm, eg 3 4 mm of visually contrasting coating material. Such concavities can for example be of depth approximately equivalent to their width, and will of course be dictated largely by the artistic requirements of whatever design is chosen. For example, confections in the form of figures having eyes and or clothing bearing buttons, can be given colour or tonal contrast in regions corresponding to eyes or buttons by making such regions in concave form with a depth of about 1 5 mm, eg 3 4 mm, and width about equal to or somewhat larger or smaller than the depth, and applying contrasting coating materials as described herein at least to such concave regions, eg by dipping or spraying, so that such materials preferentially solidify in such concave regions to give visual contrast, whether in colour, tone, or both. After the application of colour or tone contrast as described, further treatment can of course be given, such as for example a further partial coating to represent a hat for the design figure, either in chocolate or other fatty couverture or in coloured aqueous coating of suitable colour intensity and viscosity. It is apparent that these methods can be applied on eg confectionery freezing machinery having modules or stations of known form, eg stick inserting, moulding, freezing, dipping and or spraying stations of known kind, to reach a wider variety of shapes and patterns of product than would previously have been attainable otherwise than by the use of hand manufacture or potentially by the use of complex precision equipment for applying coatings differentially. Many modifications and variations can be applied to the processes and products described. For example, the invention does not depend at all, of course, on the particular type of design used for the article or the particular moulding or other method used to produce it. By way of further example, the coating to be applied unevenly to give the contrast may contain or be based on fat, eg a couverture of fat and sugar optionally with chocolate or other coloured material. Such a coating can be applied for example to the head region only of a figure with a head, by having such a head region located at the opposite end to that of insertion of a stick by which the article is held during partial dipping of the figure to the extent only of the head region. Such a coating can for example be substantially transparent and be then used to enhance the visual contrast of a subsequent aqueous or non fat coating applied to the article by rendering it non adherent to the fat coated part. Yet further coatings can comprise emulsified material such as milk solids for example. Generally the coatings can be varied, combined and permuted according to the varying contrasting design concepts to be realised in confection forms bearing surface relief by the aid of this invention.
