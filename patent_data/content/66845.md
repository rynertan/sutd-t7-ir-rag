# Induction meter having an improved electromagnetic voltage section.

## Abstract
The invention provides an induction meter including voltage 12 and current 14 magnetic sections each producing magnetic flux for driving a rotatable disk 16 at a rate responsive to an AC electric energy quantity to be measured. The induction meter has an improved voltage magnetic section comprised of a substantially E shaped laminated magnetic core 24 having a center leg 26 terminating at a main pole face and two ad jacent legs 28, 30 terminating at coplanar auxiliary pole faces on opposite sides of the main pole face. A voltage coil 33 is wound about the center leg and a nonmagnetic multi function support and spacer bracket extends from one of the adjacent legs to the other ad jacent leg and has three perpendicular extensions 43, 44, 45 which give the bracket a substantially E shaped configuration. The bracket is located adjacent to a first side of the magnetic core and has one edge substantially coplanar with the auxiliary pole faces. A T shaped lami nated magnetic core piece includes a perpendicular ex tension not visible in Fig. 1 corresponding to the center leg to provide support for the voltage coil. A light load adjuster bracket 54 provides an adjustable shunt path for magnetic flux between the main pole face and the auxiliary pole faces. The light load adjuster bracket is located in magnetic proximity to the same first side of the magnetic core and is separated therefrom by the nonmagnetic bracket. A power factor bracket 37 ex tends from the second side of the magnetic core. A flux return tongue 39 is carried by the power factor bracket and is located opposite the main pole face while maintaining a spaced relationship therewith.
