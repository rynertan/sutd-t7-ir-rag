# Improved array arrangement for EEPROMS.

## Abstract
An array arrangement for EEPR0MS in which each memory cell comprises two transistors and the selection means is simplified whereby in selecting a cell it connects all of the cells in the selected row to one terminal of the writing means and all the cells in the selected column to the other terminal. This selection means includes prevention means preventing any cell from being written into except the cell at the intersection of the selected row and the selected column.
