# BALL VALVE

## Abstract
A ball valve has a valve body 10 with a bonnet bore 12 communicating with a fluid through bore 14 . A valve seat 16 in the valve body 10 surrounds the fluid bore axis. A bonnet 20 , with a stem bore 22 extending therethrough, is received in the bonnet bore 12 . An operating stem 28 is journalled for rotation in the stem bore 22 . A ball 30 is connected to the operating stem 28 , and located in the fluid bore 14 . The ball 30 has a through passageway 32 . Rotation of the operating stem 28 causes the ball 30 to rotate eccentrically between an open position, in which the ball is spaced from the valve seat 16 with its through passageway 32 aligned with the fluid bore 14 , and a closed position, in which the ball blocks the fluid bore by being wedged into sealing engagement with the valve seat. The ball 30 is externally contoured to provide both a clearance from the valve body 10 to accommodate its eccentric rotation, and a stop 54 which is engageable with th the valve body to positively locate the ball in its open position. The ball valve can be assembled in combination with an actuator 64 having a linearly reciprocating piston 80 mechanically connected to the operating stem 28 by means of a rack 82 and a pinion 86 . Linear motion of the piston 80 is limited in one direction by the sealing engagement of the ball 30 with the valve seat 16 , and in the opposite direction by the engagement of the ball stop 54 with the valve body 10 .
