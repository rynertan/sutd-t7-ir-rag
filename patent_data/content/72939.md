# Cabinet for video game consoles, cartridges, accessories, and instruction booklets.

## Abstract
A cabinet or container particularly adapted for holding in an organized manner video game consoles of different sizes and shapes and also for holding accessories constructed for use with different systems. The cabinet has a top opening particularly shaped and constructed to receive and accom modate different control consoles or systems such as different Atari control consoles and also a Mattel Intellevi sion control console. Typically the dimensions of the control consoles vary and typically they have a base part of different dimensions. The open top of the cabinet is particularly configurated to receive and accommodate the different consoles. The base part of a control console can extend down through the opening. The console may be supported on peripheral surfaces of the opening itself or on ledges extending inwardly with respect to the opening at a level below the surface of the top. The lower part of the cabinet is preferably compartmentalized uniquely to hold different cartridges. Compartments are formed with means adapted to receive different sizes of cartridges.
