# High efficiency particulate air filter and method of fabricating same.

## Abstract
A high efficiency particulate air filter 22 comprises a frame surrounding and sealably supporting the filter pack, with the frame composed of four separate side panels 34 which are rigidly inter connected at their abutting ends by means of corner plates 54 . The corner plates 54 are formed by two flanges 55, 56 disposed at right angles to each other, and these flanges are closely received within slots formed on the outer faces 41 of the side panels. The corner plates preferably extend across the entire width of the side panels 34 to impart substantial rigidity to the frame, and a sealing material 58 is disposed in a recess which extends along the bight of the corn er plates 54 to provide a continuous seal along the abutting ends of the side panels 34 .
