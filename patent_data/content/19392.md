# Instruction register sequence decoder for microprogrammed data processor and method.

## Abstract
A data processor using microprogrammed control to execute a plurality of macroinstructions and including an instruction register 10 for storing a macroinstruction, received from a program memory, a control store including a micro control store 18 and a nano control store 20 and for storing a plurality of microinstruction routines, each including one or more microinstructions for controlling operations performed by the data processor, and each of the microinstruction routines being associated with a corresponding starting address and an instruction register sequence decoder 14 coupled to an address selection block 16 which is coupled via a line 17 to the control store 18, 20 , the decoder 14 being responsive to the macroinstruction stored by the instruction register 10 for providing a plurality of starting addresses associated with the stored macroinstruction, the decoder 14 effectively causing the data processor to perform each of the microinstruction routines associated with the starting addresses provided by the decoder 14 in order to execute the macroinstruction stored in the instruction register 10 .
