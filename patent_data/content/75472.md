# Exhaust valve for a reciprocating internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
The exhaust valve has a valve member 2 which opens away from the combustion chamber 4 of the engine cylin der and which is biased for opening by the gas pressure prevailing in the combustion chamber. The valve is kept closed by an opposed hydraulic pressure which in a holding chamber 12 acts on a holding piston 11 secured to the spindle 10 of the valve member. When the valve is to be opened, the pressure in the holding chamber is relieved and one or more valve controlled flow passages 35, 36 are opened, through which hydraulic liquid flows from the hold ing chamber to a reservoir 14 defined by a piston 13 secured to the valve spindle 10 . The two pistons 11 and 13 are preferably of substantially equal size. When the exhaust valve is to be closed a hydraulic pressure is applied to a substantially smaller closing piston 17 which is also secured to the valve spindle 10 . During the closing move ment hydraulic liquid flows from the reservoir back to the holding chambre and after the closing movement that chamber is again connected to the hydraulic pressure which ensures that the valve member is maintained in its closed position against the gas pressure.
