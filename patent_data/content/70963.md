# Electrophoretic apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrophoretic apparatus which is equipped with means for detecting that a zone of a certain kind of ion component passes through a predetermined position of a migration tube so that the electrophoresis is divided into two stages to effect a pre separation, i.e., a rough separation of target components and to effect a fine separation for finely separating said target component and so that the switch from the pre separation to the fine separation is automatical ly effected in accordance with the output of the aforemen tioned passage detecting means, which can shorten an analysis time and ensure a precise quantitative or qualitative analysis.
