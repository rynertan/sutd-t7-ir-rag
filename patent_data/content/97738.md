## Abstract
A tom tom holder for supporting a pair of tom toms on a stand has two arms 10a, 10b which are pivotally attached to each other at an upright support rod 15 . Each arm 10a, 10b includes a hinge ball pressing part 12a and a hinge ball receiving part 13a , which parts are hinged together to pivot toward and away from each other for clamping a hinge ball 17 between them. The hinge ball 17 has an attached rod 16 for holding a drum. The ball 17 is clamped at a selected orientation through a cam mechanism 18 comprising a rod 19 extending from the ball pressing to the ball receiving element and being attached to the ball receiving element 13a through a nut 20 screwed onto the rod 19 . A cam element 22 is attached to the rod 19 at the ball pressing element 12a . The cam element 22 is adjustable in its orientation for pressing upon the ball pressing element 12a for drawing the rod 19 and the attached ball receiving element 13a into a hinge ball clamping position with respect to the ball pressing element 12a .
