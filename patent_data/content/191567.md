# Information storage disc assembly.

## Abstract
An information storage disc assembly comprises at least one flexible information storage disc 12, 12A, 12B having a recording layer 12b, 12Ab, 12Bb on one surface thereof, at least one rigid rotary support plate 13, 13A, 13B fixed coaxially to the information storage disc and having a diameter approximately equal to or greater than a diameter of said information storage disc, and one or a plurality of air introducing space or holes 15, 22, 26, 32, 33, 36, 15A, 15B, 26A, 26B, 32A, 32B, 33A, 33B, 46, 36A, 36B, 121 provided in a vicinity of centers of the information storage disc and the rotary support plate for introducing air between the other surface of the information storage disc and one surface of the rotary support plate during a high speed rotation of the information storage disc assembly so that an air cushion is generated between the information storage disc and the rotary support plate. The air cushion supports the information storage disc so that the information storage disc will not rotate during the high speed rotation.
