# Flame retardant moulded articles comprising mineral clad ligneous particles.

## Abstract
The disclosed process for making cast vegetable mineral structural products having flame retardant properties utilise a major volume portion of ligneus plant fragments such as soft and hardwoods, sugarcane, cereal and fiber plant stalks, and a minor volume proportion of a mineral binder deposit comprised of magnesium or calcium oxyphosphates and inert filler particles. Fragments having thicknesses ranging from 0.3 mm to 8 mm including chips, shavings, strips, strands, fibre bundles, slivers, fibres and peeled and sawn veneer sheets, have applied to their surfaces an aqueous solution of ammonium polyphosphate or soluble acid phosphate salt supplying from 0.15 to 0.40 parts of P₂O₅ as phosphate ion per part of fragments by weight, and particulate cement solids comprised of MgO or CaO or Mg OH ₂ or Ca OH ₂ or MgCO₃ or CaCO₃ ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 part per part of fragment, and from 0.01 to 0.80 parts of inert filler particles and the mixture is molded and held under predetermined compaction pressure until the product has rigidified, in about 10 minutes time. Greater flame retardation results when the phosphate solution is mainly absorbed into the fragment surfaces before the cement solids are dusted onto the wet surfaces. At low compaction pressures the product has low bulk density and an open structure. Use og MgO of density 2.8 or higher of 100 to 250 mesh size and ammonium polyphosphates of analysis 10 34 00 or 11 37 00 with air dry or oven dry fragments in amount sufficient to retain on drying impregnated salt loads up to 65 milligrams per cc of ligneus material obtains strong, highly fire retardant product. Products molded by the processes according to the invention may comprise any of the common structural shapes such as boards, panels, slabs, beams and blocks, and may comprise frames, trusses, poles, tubes, and virtually any castable configurations. Such products may be made economically with little or even no mixing in a wide range of product bulk densities according to the degree of compaction maintained during setting, and require very short molding and curing times. Such products after curing are flame resistant, rot resistant, weather resistant, and are not attacked by termites.
