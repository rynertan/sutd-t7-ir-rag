# Energy conservation system providing current control.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus to regulate, for example, light output of either incandescent or fluorescent lamps under circumstances where full output is not required is described. The control method and apparatus combines electronic transistor switching techniques with the use of reactive circuit components to provide control of the r.m.s. level of current flowing through the load device 66 during the AC input voltage sine wave and to permit some current flow at all times during each voltage half wave. The control technique is non dissipative in the sense that losses are virtually limited to switching transitions and passive circuit element losses. The control is accomplished by controlling the time period that a transistor 52 is saturated full on. The transistor 52 is saturated on at the beginning of each voltage half wave and continues to be saturated on until the point in time within each half wave when the transistor is turned off. At that point in time, a non dissipative current limiting capacitor 60 provides an alternate current path for the load current.
