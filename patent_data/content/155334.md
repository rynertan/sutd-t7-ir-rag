# Manufacture of pantyl d panthenol mixtures.

## Abstract
A method of producing mixtures of pantyl d panthenol mixtures directly is provided by reacting d pantolactone with a mixture of 3 ethoxy propylamine and propanolamine whereby the d pantolactone reacts simultaneously with each amine in the same reaction vessel and produces pantyl and d panthenol in the same weight ratio as the ratio of gram molecules of 3 ethoxy propylamine to gram molecules of propanolamine.

## Claims
Claims 1. A method for the direct production of mixtures of pantyl with d panthenol in a given weight ratio comprising reacting dpantolactone with a mixture of 3 ethoxy propylamine and propanolamine present in the mixture in a ratio of gram molecules of 3ethoxy propylamine to gram molecules of propanolamine equivalent to the ratio of pantyl to d panthenol desired in the product mixture. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein the ratio is about 9 parts weight pantyl to about 1 part by weight d panthenol. 3. The method of claim 2 wherein the reaction is conducted at a temperature of about 80 C or less for a period up to about 4 hours.

## Description
MANUFACTURE OF PANTYL d PANTHENOL MIXTURES Field of the Invention This invention relates to a reaction mechanism for producing mixtures of pantyl and d panthenol in a single reaction sequence. Background of the Invention It has been previously known that d panthenol, namely R 2,4 dihydroxy N 3 hydroxypropyl 3 ,3 dimethylbutamide, and pantyl, the ethyl ether of d panthenol, are used as conditioning agents in shampoos and the like. Moreover, it has been known to utilize a mixture of 3 parts pantyl and 7 parts d panthenol as such conditioning agents. Even more recently it has been discovered that mixtures of 9 parts pantyl and 1 part d panthenol impart even more desirable conditioning properties to shampoos, hair lotions and conditioners containing such mixtures of pantyl and d panthenol. Heretofore it has been necessary to produce pantyl and dpanthenol separately and then mix the two products to obtain the desired mixtures. It would be highly desirable if such mixtures of pantyl and d panthenol for use in shampoos and other hair preparations could be manufactured in a simple and simultaneous process. Summary of the Invention A method of producing mixtures of pantyl d panthenol mixtures directly is provided by reacting d pantolactone with a mixture of 3 ethoxy propylamine and propanolamine whereby the d pantolactone reacts simultaneously with each amine in the same reaction vessel and produces pantyl and d panthenol in the same weight ratio as the ratio of gram molecules of 3 ethoxy propylamine to gram molecules of propanolamine. Detailed Description of the Invention In the process of this invention a mixture of 3 ethoxy propylamine and propanolamine is reacted with d pantolactone over a period of up to about 3 to 4 hours at a temperature of about 800C or less after which the reaction product is cooled to about 60 C or less and packaged. The resulting product is a mixture of pantyl d panthenol in the same weight ratio as the ratio of gram molecules of 3 ethoxy propylamine to gram molecules of propanolamine. The process of this invention is illustrated by but not limited by the following example for the preparation of a mixture of a 9 1 wt ratio of a pantyl d panthenol. Example About 12.123 kg 3 ethoxy propylamine 116.9 gram molecules and about 0.976keg propanolamine 12.99 gram molecules were mixed in a reaction vessel and to this mixture of amines about 16.9 kg d pantolactone 129.9 gram molecules was steadily added over a period of about 30 minutes at a maximum temperature of about 56 C, After completion of the lactone addition, the reaction mixture was then heated to about 80 C for about 2 hours and the reaction product cooled to about 600C and stored in a container. Theoretical yield 29.99 kg observed yield 29.71 kg. The reaction is able to be conducted with no nitrogen blanket and using un redis tilled amines. Analysis of the reaction product using HPLC assay after fourteen days gave the following composition pantyl 90.36 w w and d panthenol 9.63 w w.
