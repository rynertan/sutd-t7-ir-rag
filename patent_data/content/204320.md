# Magnetic resonance imaging method.

## Abstract
In order to measure a static field distribution with one scanning operation and to make image distortion corrections with the static field distribution and a gradient field distribu tion simultaneously considered, an image is reconstructed using a spin echo signal produced under the condition that a time interval between a 90 pulse and a 180 pulse differs from an interval between the 180 pulse and the time origin of the spin echo signal, the static field distribution is evaluated from the relation of distortions to phase errors free from a phase distortion attributed to the characteristic of a detecting part and a phase distortion attributed to the dynamic characteristic of the gradient field, a relations existing between the spatial distortion and phase distortion of the reconstructed image and a magnetic feild distribution including the gradient field is obtained, and the distortion magnitude of the reconstructed image is evaluated from the measured magnetic field distri bution.
