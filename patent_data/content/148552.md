## Description
STREPTOMYCES EXPRESSION SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR EXPRESSING DNA SEQUENCES IN STREPTOMYCES TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to Streptomyces expression systems and to methods of expressing foreign DNA sequences in Streptomyces. More particularly, the invention relates to methods for producing polypeptides and proteins coded for by those foreign DNA sequences in Streptomyces. These polypeptides and proteins are then useful in vaccines, in pharmaceutical and animal health care products, in industrial products, and as intermediates in the production of those products or other such products by more traditional chemical or biological processes. BACKGROUND ART Numerous eukaryotic and viral genes have been expressed in the gram negative bacterium,Escherichia coli. Examples of such expression include the production of polypeptides displaying a biological or immunological activity of human leukocyte interferons S. Nagata et al., Synthesis In E. coli OfA Polypeptide With Human Leukocyte Interferon Activity , Nature, 284 pp. 316 20 1980 , antigens displaying the specificity of human hepatitis B viral antigens C. J. Burrell et al., Expression In Escherichia coli Of Hepatitis B Virus DNA Sequences Cloned In Plasmid pBR322 , Nature, 279, pp. 43 47 1979 M.Pasek et al., Hepatitis B Virus Genes And TheirExpression In E. coli , Nature, 282, pp. 575 79 1979 and polypeptides displaying the antigenicity of FMD viral antigens I. Kipper et al., CloningOf cDNA Of Major Antigen Of Foot And Mouth DiseaseVirus And Expression In E. coli. , Nature, 289, pp. 555 59 1981 . However, the production of such useful eukaryotic and viral products in E. coli is characterized by several disadvantages. For example, becauseE. coli are routinely present in the intestinal tract of animals and humans, careful handling of E. coli hosts that have been modified to produce a desired product is required to prevent accidental infection.At present, the E. coli hosts that are permitted to be used to produce desired products are limited to those that will not grow outside of the laboratory environment. Moreover, the transformed E. coli hosts must be grown in closed systems under high conditions of containment as now mandated by the guidelines of the National Institute of Health, and other like governmental organizations . The resultant E. coli cultures must also be processed to kill the bacteria before opening the system to the environment. These requirements, obviously, greatly increase the material and equipment costs of fermentation processes usingE. coli. In addition, some of the bacterial products of E. coli are endotoxins. Therefore, before eukaryotic and viral products produced in E. coli hosts are able to be be used in animals and humans, theE. coli endotoxins must be totally eliminated from.the desired product. Obviously, this elimination also entails costly and cumbersome purification and isolation procedures Numerous eukaryotic and viral genes have also been expressed in various strains of the gram positive bacterium Bacillus. Examples of such expression include the hepatitus B viral core antigens K. Hardy et al, Production In B. subtilis Of Hepatitis Core Antigen And Of Major Antigen Of Foot AndMouth Disease Virus , Nature, 293, pp. 48 P3 1981 , and the antigens of foot and mouth disease virus K. Hardy et al, supra . The production of such products in Bacillus hosts is advantaged in many respects, as compared to E. coli hosts. For example, the most commonly used Bacillus host, B. subtilis, is non pathogenic.It does not have the capacity to infect humans or animals. It also does not produce endotoxins. Therefore, the production of eukaryotic and viral proteins in B. subtilis hosts avoids the disadvantageous high containment fermentation and harvesting conditions mandated for E. coli fermentations. It also avoids the necessity of purifying the product to remove all traces of host produced toxins. Finally, Bacillus hosts naturally secrete several of their protein products into the extracellular space of the cell.Therefore, such products may be recovered readily from the cell and purified without the attendant contaminants derived from lysis or break up of the host cells. Although E. coli and Bacillus hosts are now being used to produce proteins and polypeptides encoded for by various foreign DNA sequences used to transform those hosts, the full potential of recombinant DNA technology has not been realized in these hosts. There are several reasons for this failure. For example, it is difficult to grow E. coli and Bacillus hosts to very high density. Accordingly, fermentation yields are lower on a per volume basis than would otherwise be possible with cultures able to be grown to higher density. In addition, E. coli and Bacillus hosts do not remain active producers of the desired products over long periods of time unless they are immobilized. Again, this results in lower fermentation yields than would otherwise be obtainable. These disadvantages of E. coli and Bacillus hosts may, however, be avoided by the use ofStreptomyces hosts to produce the desired eukaryotic and viral products. Streptomyces are non toxic.None is known to cause disease in, or be a commensal of, man or animals. Moreover, Streptomyces are widely employed in industrial fermentations to produce antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, macrolides and ss lactam, polyether and glycopeptide antibiotics.Accordingly, there is a wide range of knowledge about, and experience with Streptomyces fermentations and purifications available to the art. For example,Streptomyces may be grown to very high culture densities. Streptomyces also exhibit a secondary metabolism, after the completion of vegetative growth, that permits them to remain active synthesizers of a desired product for several weeks. Finally,Streptomyces excrete many of their products during this secondary metabolism. Because Streptomyces contain a wider variety of such extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, e.g., proteases, amylases, cellulases, lipases, nucleases and others, thanE. coli or Bacillus, Streptomyces hosts are more adaptable to the excretion of desired products than the former two host genera. However, in spite of the advantages of employing Streptomyces hosts in recombinant DNA technology to produce desired eukaryotic, viral and other foreign products, no successful cloning system for the expression of foreign DNA sequences, particularly eukaryotic or viral DNA sequences, in Streptomyces hosts has been reported. Instead, the former work with Streptomyces has been limited to investigations of Streptomyces genetics, its plasmids, phages and DNA, methods for reintroducing Streptomyces DNA into Streptomyces, and the expression of bacterial derived DNA sequences in those hosts. See, e.g., K. F. Chater et al., Gene Cloning In Streptomyces , CurrentTopics in Microbiology and Immunology, pp. 69 85 1982 C. J. Thompson et al., Biochemical Characterization Of Resistance Determinants Cloned FromAntibiotic Producing Streptomycetes , J. Bact., 151, pp. 678 85 1982 C. J.

None of these investigations has resulted in the cloning of a eukaryotic, viral or other foreignDNA sequence into a streptomycete or its expression in that host to produce the polypeptide coded for by it. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally solves the problems referred to above by, for the first time, providing Streptomyces expression systems and methods for using those systems to express foreignDNA sequences, particularly eukaryotic and viralDNA sequences, in Streptomyces. More particularly, we provide in accordance with this invention aStreptomyces expression system for expressing foreignDNA sequences in Streptomyces that is characterized by at least one promoter selected from the group consisting of the promoters of Streptomyces aminoglycoside phosphotransferases. By virtue of our invention, it is possible for the first time to employ Streptomyces hosts to synthesize eukaryotic, viral and other foreign polypeptides and proteins in Streptomyces. Moreover, the expression systems of our invention permit the cloning of the foreign DNA sequences coding for those desired products, the transformation of Streptomyces hosts with those DNA sequences, and the expression of those foreign DNA sequences in Streptomyces.Accordingly, the expression systems and methods of this invention for the first time enable the advantages of Streptomyces hosts to be realized in the production and excretion of products through recombinant DNA technology. As will be appreciated from the disclosure to follow, this novel combination of recombinantDNA technology and Streptomyces hosts enables the large scale and high yield production of products useful in a wide variety of pharmaceutical, animal health and industrial applications. The promoters and expression systems of this invention may also usefully be employed to amplify the expression of Streptomyces derived DNA sequences that encode various antibiotics and other useful products. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figures 1 and 2 are a schematic outline of one embodiment of a Streptomyces expression system of this invention and of a method of employing that system to produce a desired animal hormone bovine growth hormone . Figures 3 and 4 depict the nucleotide sequence encoding and the amino acid sequence of neomycin phosphotransferase and portions of the 3 and 5 non coding regions of that DNA sequence. The promoter and other expression control sequences of the neomycin phosphotransferase coding sequence are located in the 5 non coding region depicted inFigure 3 between the SstII site and the start of the coding region. BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION In order that this invention may be more fully understood, the following detailed description is set forth. In this description the following terms are employed Polypeptide A linear array of amino acids connected one to the other by peptide bonds between the a amino and carboxy groups of adjacent amino acids. Expression The process undergone by aDNA sequence or gene to produce a polypeptide. It is a combination of transcription the process of producing mRNA from a DNA sequence and translation the process of producing a polypeptide from mRNA . Plasmid A non chromosomal, doubiestranded DNA sequence comprising an intact replicon such that the plasmid is replicated in a host cell.When the plasmid is placed within a unicellular organism, the characteristics of that organism may be changed or transformed as a result of the DNA of the plasmid. For example, a plasmid carrying the gene for tetracycline resistance TetR transforms a cell previously sensitive to tetracycline into one which is resistant to it. A cell transformed by a plasmid is called a 11transformant Phage or Bacteriophage Bacterial virus, many of which consist of DNA sequences encapsidated in a protein envelope or coat capsid protein . Streptomyces Cloning Vector A plasmid, phage DNA or other DNA.sequenee that has a an intact replicon, such that the cloning vehicle is able to replicate in a Streptomyces host and b one or a small number of endonuclease recognition sites at which such DNA sequences may be cut in a determinable fashion without attendant loss of an essential biological function of the cloning vehicle, e.g., replication or production of coat proteins. Preferably, a Streptomyces cloning vector, as originally constructed, or after a foreign DNA sequence is inserted therein, also has a marker suitable for use in the identification of correctly transformed cells, e.g., viomycin resistance, thiostrepton resistance, erythromycin resistance, or the production of some other detectable protein product or sensitivity to such product or antibiotic.A Streptomyces cloning vector is often called a Streptomyces cloning vehicle. Cloning The process of obtaining a population of organisms or DNA sequences derived from one such organism or sequence by asexual reproduction. Recombinant DNA Molecule or Hybrid DNA A molecule consisting of segments of DNA from different genomes which have been joined end to end outside of living cells and have the capacity to infect some host cell and be maintained therein. Streptomyces Expression Control Sequence A sequence of nucleotides that controls and regulates the expression of DNA sequences in a Streptomyces host, when operatively linked to those DNA sequences. A Streptomyces expression control sequence includes a promoter region and the various operator regions, ribosome binding sites, and other sequences, including, if necessary, an ATG start signal to control and to regulate the expression of a DNA sequence operatively linked thereto. Streptomyces Host A microbial strain selected from the genus Streptomyces. It may include, for example, S. acrimycini, S. albus,S. azureus, S. fradiae, S. glaucescens, S. griseus,S. parvulus, S. pristinaespiralis, S. rimosus,S. violaceotuber, S. lividans, S. coelicolor and other strains of the genus Streptomyces, such as those listed in European patent application 77,649. Foreign DNA Sequence A non Streptomycesderived DNA sequence encoding a protein or polypeptide, particularly one of eukaryotic or viral origin. As described previously, the Streptomyces expression systems and methods of this invention are characterized by at least one promoter selected from the group consisting of the promoters ofStreptomyces aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. A large number of such promoters are known. They are believed to contribute to the resistance of a particular Streptomyces to the aminoglycoside made in that streptomycete. Examples of such aminoglycoside phosphotransferases are streptomycin phosphotransferase, neomycin phosphotransferase and kanamycin The term operatively linked11 includes having an appropriate start signal in front of the foreign gene or DNA sequence encoding the desired product and maintaining the correct reading frame to permit expression of the foreign DNA sequence and production of the desired product under the control of the expression control sequence. phosphotransferase. We prefer neomycin and kanamycin phosphotransferase. We have also found that when such promoters are employed in Streptomyces that do not produce any aminoglycoside, the activity of the promoter is greatly amplified, perhaps as a result of the absence of repressors in those non aminoglycoside producing strains. Accordingly, we prefer to use such nonaminoglycoside producing strains as our Streptomyces host. However, the promoters of our invention are also active, although perhaps to a lesser extent, in aminoglycoside producing strains of Streptomyces and those hosts may also be used in this invention. In the expression systems and methods of this invention, the promoters of the variousStreptomyces aminoglycoside phosphotransferases, described above, are employed in Streptomyces expression control sequences in such a way as to control and to regulate the expression of foreign DNA sequences operatively linked to those expression control sequences in Streptomyces cloning vectors containing those expression control sequences and foreign DNA sequences. These vectors are then employed to transform Streptomyces hosts and the transformed hosts cultured to produce the desired polypeptides and proteins. As we have previously described, these expression systems and methods are useful in the expression of various foreign DNA sequences, particularly those of eukaryotic and viral origin, inStreptomyces hosts. Examples of such eukaryotic and viral DNA sequences are sequences encoding human and animal leukocyte interferons IFN aX, fibroblast interferons IFN B , and immune interferons IFN y , human insulin, human and animal growth and other hormones, human serum albumin and various human blood factors and plasminogen activators, both tissue and urokinase, hepatitis B viral core and surface antigens,FMD viral antigens and other human, animal and viral polypeptides and proteins. It should also be understood that in one embodiment of this invention, the Streptomyces promoters and expression systems of this invention are employed to amplify the expression of Streptomycesderived DNA sequences that code the various antibodies and other products. In this embodiment, the promoters and expression systems of this invention are employed to improve the yield or speed of any rate limiting step in the biological pathway of antibiotic or other productions in Streptomyces. In such embodiment, the promoters or expression systems of this invention are operatively linked to the DNA sequence encoding the products of that rate limiting step of the metabolic pathway. It should also be understood that within the Streptomyces cloning vehicles useful with the expression systems of this invention a large number of variations are possible. For example, a wide variety of intact replicons may be employed in these cloning vectors. Such replicons may be selected from any of the plasmids and phages available in Streptomyces. This is a very large number because more than 30 of theStreptomyces strains examined to date have plasmids.See, e.g., K. F. Chater, supra European patent application 77,649 T. Kieser et al., supra andC. J. Thompson et al., Nature, supra. The replicons from any of these plasmids or phages may be employed in the Streptomyces cloning vehicles of this invention. Of course, not all of the above described replicons function with equal efficiency in a particular streptomycete. For example, some replicons may be repressed more than others in a particular streptomycete. More importantly, some replicons provide a higher copy number than other replicons.Those of skill in the art can select a replicon useful for a particular streptomycete using the principles and teachings of this invention. We prefer to use the high copy replicon of pIJIO1 T. Kieser et al., supra in the Streptomyces cloning vectors and expression control systems of this invention. A wide variety of selectable markers and endonuclease recognition sites may also be employed in Streptomyces cloning vehicles useful in the expression systems of this invention. For example, such markers may include resistance or sensitivity to neomycin, thiostrepton and erythromycin, or the production or lack of production of a detectable product, such as tyrosinase which polymerizes tyrosine to melanine a black product. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, we prefer to use tyrosinase production and lack of production as the screenable black white marker for insertion of the foreignDNA sequence. In that preferred embodiment we also prefer to employ Streptomyces cloning vehicles carrying the DNA sequence encoding thiostrepton resistance. Useful restriction sites in the Streptomyces cloning vehicles and expression systems of our invention include, for example, EcoRI, BamEI, PstI, NcoI,ClaI, SstI and any of the many other sites available or combinations of them. The selection of a particular restriction site or combination of sites is controlled by the particular Streptomyces expression control sequence and Streptomyces cloning vector employed and the particular DNA sequence desired to be expressed. For example, if a particular protein, e.g., a mature protein, is to be produced without any extraneous amino acid, the restriction site chosen must enable the linking of the DNA sequence encoding that protein to the expression control sequence in a manner that allows the desired protein to be produced by the cell. The restriction sites useful in the products and methods of this invention may be constructed in the expression systems of this invention by methods well known in the art without departing from the scope of this invention. Such methods include using synthetic or naturally occurring DNA segments that carry the desired endonuclease recognition site or sites or by modifying such DNA to produce the desired site or sites. As we have described previously, theStreptomyces expression control sequences that are useful in the expression systems and methods of this invention are characterized by at least one promoter selected from the group consisting of the promoters of Streptomyces aminoglycoside phosphotransferases.It should, however, also be understood that these expression control sequences also include the other nucleotide sequences known to be necessary to allow the expression control sequence to control and to regulate the expression of a DNA sequence operativelylinked to it. Such other necessary sequences include, for example, operator sequences, Shine Dalgarno sequences and ribosome binding sites. Although in the preferred embodiment of our invention, we prefer to employ the promoter and the other necessary expression sequences from the same Streptomyces aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, our invention is not so limited. Instead, we can also combine at least one of our defined class of promoters of Streptomyces aminoglycoside phosphotransferases with other expression sequences derived from a wide variety of sources, both synthetic and natural, to construct the expression control sequence of our invention.For example, the ribosome binding site,Shine Dalgano sequence, or both, of the expression control sequences of this invention may be derived from the DNA sequences that control the synthesis of another Streptomyces produced protein, from DNA sequences that control the synthesis of the protein desired to be expressed, from DNA sequences that control the synthesis of unrelated proteins, by synthesis or by any combination of these sources. All that is required for the practice of this invention is that the promoter be selected from our defined class of promoters. It should also be understood that theStreptomyces expression control sequences of this invention may be either constitutive or controllable.However, we prefer expression control sequences that are controllable or inducible, for example, by change in temperature or by the addition of an activating compound to the fermentation culture. In that way, the culture may be grown to a high cell density before expression of the desired DNA sequence is activated.This mode of inducible operation is especially important when the product produced is inherently toxic to the cell or is toxic to the cell at the levels produced during the fermentation. Again, it should be understood that not all Streptomyces expression control sequences will function with equal facility in controlling and regulating the expression of a particular foreign DNA sequence in a particular Streptomyces host. Instead, such factors as the transcription and translation strength of the promoter in a given host and its repression, the spatial and sequence relationships between the expression control sequence and the foreign DNA sequence to be expressed, the stability of the mRNA transcript in the host, the toxicity of the produced product to the host and the growth conditions of the host must be considered.However, by considering those factors those of skill in the art may select an appropriate combination of aStreptomyces expression control sequence, a foreignDNA sequence and a Streptomyces host to obtain a high level of expression of the desired DNA sequence. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, we prefer to employ the Streptomyces expression control sequence of an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and a Streptomyces host that does not produce any aminoglycoside. More preferably, the Streptomyces host also does not produce any restriction endonuclease that would degrade or destroy the expression system used to transform that host. In one preferred embodiment of the expression systems and methods of our invention, we also employ a DNA sequence encoding at least a part of the signal sequence of a polypeptide or protein normally secreted from the Streptomyces host employed with the expression system or a part of the DNA sequence encoding the signal sequence of the foreign protein itself, if that is functional in Streptomyces, in order to cause the product of the inserted DNA sequence to be excreted from the Streptomyces host and matured. In this preferred embodiment, the DNA encoding the signal sequence is operatively linked to the Streptomyces expression control sequence of this invention and also linked in the same reading frame to the foreign DNA sequence desired to be expressed through the position of normal signal sequence cleavage.In this way, the product coded for by the foreign DNA sequence will be made as a putative fusion protein, consisting of the Streptomyces or other signal sequence and the foreign protein. The signal sequence will then effect transport of the fusion protein through the Streptomyces cell wall and maturation of the desired protein by cleavage of that signal sequence. See, e.g., L. Villa Komaroff et al., A Bacterial Clone Synthesizing Proinsulin , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 75, pp. 3727 31 1981 K. Talmadge et al., Bacteria Mature PreproinsulinTo Proinsulin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77, pp. 3988 92 1980 K. Talmadge et al., EukaryoticSignal Sequence Transports Insulin Antigen InEscherichia coli , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA, 77, pp. 3396 73 1980 . In another embodiment of this invention, we employ a DNA sequence encoding at least apart of another protein or polypeptide or at least a part of the signal sequence of a protein or polypeptide that is secreted from Streptomyces and a part of the coding sequence for that protein or polypeptide between the expression control sequence of this invention and the DNA sequence encoding the desired foreign DNA product. In this embodiment a fusion protein consisting of the part the protein or polypeptide coded for by the DNA sequence and the foreign protein or polypeptide is produced. Such fusion proteins may be used as improved immunogens in vaccines and also as degradation protective devices.Such constructions may also be advantageous in improving the level of expression in a particular host. In order that this invention may be more clearly understood, we have included the following examples for illustrative purposes only. EXAMPLE THE EXPRESSION OF A DNA SEQUENCE ENCODING BOVINE GROWTH HORMONE IN STREPTOMYCES This example illustrates a Streptomyces expression system of this invention that is characterized by the promoter of neomycin phosphotransferase and the use of that system and promoter to express a DNA sequence encoding bovine growth hormone BGH in Streptomyces. a Preparation Of The Promoter Of Neomycin Phosphotransferase Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, we have depicted therein in schematic outline one embodiment of the construction of an expression system of this invention. In this system, we have employed the promoter and other expression control sequences of neomycin phosphotransferase. In the embodiment depicted in Figures 1 and 2, we began our construction with plasmid pIJ2 C. J. Thompson et al., Nature, 286, pp. 525 27 1980 . As shown in Figure 1, pIJ2 contains a genomic DNA sequence from S. fradiae which encodes neomycin phosphotransferase When pIJ2 was employed to transform S. livadans 66 N. Lomovskaya et al.,J. Virol., 9, pp. 258 62 1972 John Innes StockNo. 1326 , which does not produce any aminoglycoside and which is sensitive to neomycin, the transformed strain became resistant to neomycin. Moreover, this neomycin phosphotransferase activity was expressed at a high level 2.6 U mg and an abundant, insert specific, 32,000 dalton protein was observed bySDS PAGE. We prepared mycelial soluble protein extracts of early stationary phase S. lividans pIJ2 , grown in yeast extract malt extract medium YEME by sonication and centrifugation C. J. Thompson et al., J. Bact., 151, pp. 678 85 1982 . We then purified the neomycin phosphotransferase activity from the extracts by ammonium sulfate precipitation 60 90 saturation and HPLC Waters, Brownlee column 0.046 cm , packed with a RP300 C18 matrix for reverse phase chromatography . We eluted the neomycin phosphotransferase activity as a single peak 90 recovery at 91 in a 40 100 acetonitrile gradient, containing 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid.After we pooled the active fractions, we lyophilized them, dialized them against water and subj ected them to SDS PAGE or amino acid analysis Applied Biosystems, model 470A, gas phase protein sequencer . As a result of this analysis, which was done under conditions that would not have detected blocked formylated amino termini, we determined the amino terminal sequences of the neomycin phosphotransferase activity to be NH2 unknown Asp Asp Ser Thr Leu unknown unknown Lys Tyr. We then determined the nucleotide sequence of a portion of the S.fradiae derived sequence of pIJ2 that carried the gene coding for neomycin phosphotransferase and its expression control region using the Maxam Gilbert technique EA. Maxam W. Gilbert, in Methods in Enzymology, L. Grosman K. Moldave eds., Academic Press, New York, 65 1 , pp. 499 560 1980 . We have depicted this sequence in Figures 3 and 4. We have also depicted in Figures 3 and 4, the start of the DNA sequence coding for neomycin phosphotransfrase by comparison with the aminoterminal sequence we had previously determined for this protein and the complete amino acid sequence of that protein. We have also depicted in Figures 3 and 4, parts of the 3 and 5 non coding regions of neomycin phosphotransferase.As shown in Figure 3, there was an NcoI endonuclease recognition site at the start of the coding region of the neomycin phosphotransferase DNA sequence. We were unable to identify specifically those DNA sequences in the 51 non coding region depicted in Figure 3 which control the transcription and translation of the S.fradiae neomycin phosphotransferase gene by comparison with the consensus The nucleotide sequencing was done by subcloning parts of the s. fradiae derived DNA sequence intoE. coli cloning vectors because it is simpler to produce the large amounts of DNA needed for sequencing in E. coli hosts. sequences proposed for gene expression in E.coli M. Rosenberg D. Court, Ann. Rev. Genet., 13, pp. 319 53 1979 L. Gold et al., Ann. Rev.Microbiol., 35, pp. 365 403 1981 or those sequences proposed for Bacillus subtilis EN. Z.Gilman et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 9, pp. 5991 6000 1981 . However, the presence of the streptomycete promoter in this sequence between the SstII restriction site and the start of the coding sequence Figure 3 was confirmed by the expression of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene in Streptomyces strains transformed with various plasmids characterized by the SstII fragment of our genomic sequence. We then subcloned a 1.1 Kb PstI fragment of pIJ2 into the PstI site of pBR322 to produce pIJ32 Figure 1 . Plasmid pIJ32 contained the coding region for the first 2 3 of neomycin phosphotransferase, as well as its promoter and the other sequences necessary for its expression. Because pBR322 carries anE. coli replicon, this subcloning allowed us to work in E. coli for our further constructions. b Manipulations Of The Promoter Of Neomycin Phosphotrans ferase We next isolated the 1.1 Kb PstI fragment of pIJ32 carrying the neomycin phosphotransferasederived DNA sequences and subcloned it into the PstI site pUC9 using E.coli JM 101 J. Vieira and J.Messing, The pUC Plasmids, An M13mp7 Derived SystemFor Insertion Mutagenesis And Sequencing With Synthetic Universal Primers , Gene, 19, pp. 259 68 1982 .We designated the resulting plasmid pECl9. As shown in Figure 1, this plasmid had a series of useful restriction sites upstream of the promoter and expression control region of the neomycin phosphotransferase derived DNA sequence i.e.5 to the gene . Again, we were able to work inE. coli hosts to manipulate this pUC9 derived plasmid. We next isolated from pECl9 the about 600 bp NcoI EcoRI fragment that carried the promoter and expression control region of the neomycin phosphotransferase sequence Figure 3 . Because theATG start codon of the coding sequence of neomycin phosphotransferase was part of an NcoI site, this 600 bp fragment included the non coding 5 region of the neomycin phosphotransferase derived DNA sequence and ended at the beginning of the coding region for that protein. c Combination Of The Promoter Of Neomycin Phosphotransferase And A DNA Sequence Encoding Bovine Growth Hormone We combined the above described 600 bp fragment carrying the neomycin phosphotransferase expression system with the NcoI EcoRI fragment of p167 Figure 1 . This latter fragment contained the coding region for bovine growth hormone BGH . We designated our new plasmid pEC24 Figure 1 . It carried the promoter and expression control sequences of neomycin phosphotransferase connected in a perfect construct via the NcoI ligation to the ATG start codon of the coding sequence of f met BGH. d Expression Of f Met Bovine Growth Hormone In Streptomyces Under The Control Of A Neomycin Phosphotrans ferase Expression System We cloned the about 1300 bp BamHI fragment from pEC24 into the BglII site of Streptomyces plasmid p167 was a gift of G. Buell. It was deposited in the American Type Culture Collection on August 16, 1982, under ATCC accession number 39173. This culture will be made available at the same time and under the same conditions as the cultures described on page 21, whereof pIJ702 Figure 2 . We selected the correct transformant by physical sizing and the absence of a BglII site the ligation of a BamHI and a BglII site does not regenerate either site . Plasmid pIJ702 is a derivative of pIJIO1 T. Kieser et al., Mol. Gen. Genet., 185, pp. 223 38 1982 . This plasmid contains the gene coding for thiostrepton resistance. It also contains the gene coding for tyrosinase Figure 2 . Tyrosinase polymerizes tyrosine to melanine which is black. Clones having the tyrosinase gene inactivated by a foreignDNA insertion at the BqlII site of that gene will be white in the presence of tyrosine, as compared to clones without such an insert that are black. We used this black white screening to determine which of our clones had been correctly transformed with the DNA fragment containing the Streptomyces neomycin phosphotransferase promoter and expression control sequences and the coding sequence of BGH. We transformed S.lividans 66 John InnesStock No. 1326 Lomovskaya et al. J. Virol., 9, pp . 258 62 1972 with plasmid pIJ702 and selected the white colonies. We designated one of these colonies, containing plasmid pBG22, S. lividans TC98 Figure 2 . A sample of the culture was deposited infra . We cultured S. lividans TC98 in YEME and also in minimal media for various times up to several weeks at 300C. We then prepared cell extracts by centrifugation and lysozyme treatment or sonication and assayed the extracts for the presence of BGH. We have deposited a sample of pIJ703, another derivative of pIJIO1 infra . Plasmids pIJ702 and pIJ703 are identical hybrids except that the fragments containing the gene coding the for the tyrosinase determinant mel and the gene coding for thiostrepton resistance tsr are transposed E. Katz et al., J. Gen. Microbiol., 129, pp. 2703 14 1983 . We detected BGH in our extracts. The BGH production of our transformed Streptomyces strains initially rose to a steady state level. That level of production was then maintained for several weeks after vegetative growth of the Streptomyces had been completed. We analyzed the proteins in the S. lividans lysates by SDS PAGE followed by immuno blotting and observed no immunoreacative products smaller than the actual hormone, which suggests that BGH is not degraded in S. lividans although our procedure might not detect breakdown products smaller than 14 kd . We introduced plasmids containing the BGH gene into E. coli and S. lividans to compare expression of the gene in the two hosts. When the yields were nomalized to the total protein content of the cells, we determined that S. lividans contained three times the hormone contained in E. coli. No BGH was detected in the culture medium following growth of either strain. We found that we could appreciably increase the yield of BGH from S. lividans by replacing theDNA sequence coding for mature BGH with a DNA insert in which the coding region for the first nine amino acids of mature BGH had been removed, and the coding region for the tenth amino acid modified from CTG toTTG, a change that does not alter its amino acid leucine . It should, of course, be understood that while the above illustrative embodiment of this invention involved the combination of the promoter and other expression control sequences of neomycin phosphotransferase with a DNA sequence encoding BGE, the construction could as well have been effected by various other sequences of steps. For example, the DNA sequence encoding BGH could have been in serted into a Streptomyces cloning vector already carrying the desired expression control sequence or the expression control sequence could have been inserted into a Streptomyces cloning vector already carrying the BGH coding sequence. It should also be understood that the entire expression control sequence in our Example need not have been taken from the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. As described previously, only the promoter of the expression control sequence of this invention need to be derived from a Streptomyces aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. The other elements of the expression control sequence may be independently derived or constructed. It should also be understood that the manipulations leading to the final Streptomyces expression system need not have been done in E. coli.Rather, they could have been done in any host strain.However, we prefer to employ E. coli because of the ease of manipulation, transformation and growth in that strain. Finally, it should be understood that anyStreptomyces host in which the replicon of pIJ702 is functional could have been used in our illustrative example to produce bovine growth hormone. Microorganisms and recombinant DNA molecules prepared by the processes of this invention are exemplified by cultures deposited in the American TypeCulture Collection, Rockville, Maryland on June 6, 1983, and identified there as A Streptomyces lividans 66 pIJ703 B Streptomyces lividans 66 pBG22 or S. lividans TC 98These cultures were assigned accession numbers 39378 and 39379, respectively. A process similar to that described above has also been used successfully to express a gene that encodes human serum albumin in S. Lividans.Thus, illustrating that the methods of this invention are useful for the expression of a variety of genes in Strepomyces. While we have hereinbefore presented a number of embodiments of this invention, it is apparent that our basic construction can be altered to provide other embodiments which utilize the processes and compositions of this invention. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the scope of this invention is to be defined by the claims appended hereto, rather than by the specific embodiments which have been presented hereinbefore by way of example.
