# Radiation image read out apparatus.

## Abstract
A radiation image read out apparatus comprises a sec tion for reading out a radiation image stored in a stimulable phosphor sheet, a section for erasing the radiation energy remaining on the stimulable phosphor sheet after image read out, and a section for stacking the stimulable phosphor sheets after erasing. The erasing section and the stacking section are positioned above the read out section. A read out sheet conveyance system is positioned between the read out section and the erasing section for conveying the sti mulable phosphor sheet so that the surface of the stimulable phosphor sheet facing up at the read out section faces up also at the erasing section. An erased sheet conveyance sys tem is positioned between the erasing section and the stack ing section for conveying the stimulable phosphor sheet so that the surface of the stimulable phosphor sheet facing up at the erasing section faces down at the stacking section.
