## Description
SPECIFICATION TITLECOMPOSITE BRAKE DRUM DESCRIPTION This invention relates to motor vehicle brake drums. According to the present invention, there is provided a brake drum comprising a stamped steel back plate, a cast iron braking ring and a die cast barrel which supports the braking ring and the back plate and which is composed of a metal having a specific gravity less then those of the materials from which the braking ring and back plate are composed. Fuel economy improviments demand size and weight reduction of motor vehicle components often at the same time requiring improved structral properties. It is known that di casting with light metal as with aluminium allow can replace same features in brake drums to reduce weight. In this invention, however, a steel drum back is used that allows weight reduction compared to structurally similar drums with cast aluminium drum backs. The brake drums of this invention have a steel drum back and cast iron braking ring surrounded by asn aluminium die cast barrel that blend advantage of the weight reduction afforded by light weight die cast with performance, cast and weight advantages derived from a steel back and cast iron braking ring. For exemple, the steel drum back requires less machining than a comparable die cast drum back as well as having better brake roughness ratings. Further, use of die casting of the drum barrel permits lower weight and other advantages such as high productivity and inherently better centering of the drum back and braking ring which reduce the amount of balancing required.When further, the braking ring with its rough outer surface has superior heat transfer properties over a braking ring with alternative surfaces i.e. smooth, as cast or looking lugs while facilitating processing as it eliminates need for complex chucking during its machining. The preferred brake drum of this invention comprises a substantialls biplanar stamped steel drum back joindes to a cast iron braking ring by means of die cast aluminium or other lightweigt alloy casting. The light weight metal fills a plurality of holos and voids in its outermost edge in one plane of the drum back and interlocks with the rough outer surface of the braking ring to provide a unitary brake drum. A preffered embodiment of the invention wil now be described, by way of exemple only, with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a partial quarter radial cross section of the composite brake drumn taken its open and shwoing stamped steel drum back, cast iron braking ring and aluminium die cast barrel that is partially out away. Figure 2 is an axial cross sectional vies ef the brakc drum of Figure 1. In Figure 1, the composite brake drum 3 is shown with stamped steel drum back 4, cast iron braking ring 6 of uniform section and barrel 8 of die cast aluminium e.g. SAT380 or other light weight metal alloy. Stamped steel drum back 1 has voids 10 and holes 12 in the puter edge of its perifery which fill with the light weight metal of barrel 8 during die casting. Stamped steel drum back 4 also has annular convoute 16 that projects in part toward the open end of brake drum 3. The convolute permits flexing during braking in order to reduce brake roughness. Stamped steel drum back still further comprise center hole 13 for axle shaft engagement along with equally spaced holes including hole 20 that package wheel attachement studs not shown .Bevel 22 surrounding centre hole 18 is a pilot for centering the drum on the axle shaft not shown . The aluminium or other light weight metal die casr alloy of barrel 8 that joins the drum 4 and cast iron braking ring 6 at its outer rough surface also form ribs or fins 24 that project radially outward from the braking ring 6 and provide a means for heat rejection from the brake drum. About 30 or more, e.g. 37 such equally spaced fins normelly are sufficient for de sired heat rejection oven under extreme conditions . In making the drum, braking ring 6 is supported by ring support pins not shown. that project through at least three pin supportt holes as 14 during die casting of barrel 8 about dram back and braking ring 6. Figure 2 further illustrates the composite brake drum by showing across section taken perpendicular to Figure 1. Stamped steel drumj back as is seen in Figure 2 is substantially biplanar with midsection 102 comprising contre hole 18 and wheel bolt holes 20 in a first plane. Midsection 102 has bevel edge 22 that projects away from the braking surface. Stamped steel drum back a further comprises outer perifery 104 in a second plane. Outermost edge 106 of perifery 104 comprises holes and voids as is more clearly seen in Figure 1 and is encased in the die cast alloy of barrel 8 such that the radial dimension of drum back 4 alternatively exceeds and falls short of the radial dimension of cast iron braking ring 6. The barrel is locked to the drum back by filling of the holes and voids of its outermost edgs. Perifery 104 and midsection 102 are integrated through flexing convolute 16 which extends from perifery 104 in a direction parallel a radial dimension perpendicular to each of the planes are having a radial dimension perpendicular to each of the planes of perifery 104 and mixsection 102. Balance weight 108 is easily attached by welding or other means to outer perifery 104 after die casting. Cast iron brakinh ring 6 has amooth inner braking surface 110 and rough outer surface 112 which provides for strong bond between it and die cast barrel 8. The barking ring 6 is conventionally centrifugially cast with rough outer surface that has had mould coating removed by light sand or grit blast to provids peaks from about ten one thousandth to one tenth inch high.Such braking rings made of gray iron are commercially available as in Bulletin No. 610211 7625 of Dans Corporation. It is to be understood that the relative thickness of the braking ring 6 and barrel 8 may be modified in accordance with desired processing and final brkae drum chracterisitics. Thus, for exemple, the braking ring may be made somewh t thinner than that of the drawings thereby permitting some reduction in weight by replacement with more lightweight metal, but a tradeoff such as braking ring distortion may be seen during processing. Con versely, an increase in the thickness while providing possbly some performance improvement does increase weight as well as allowing a greater possibility of chilling of the die cast than at lesser dimensions. In making the composite brake drum herein, the prehoated cast iron braking ring 6 is mounted on the preformed stamped steel drum back 4 by means of support pins hole therefore seen inFigures 1 and 2 as 1A within the mould and an madrel through. centre hole 18. Die casting is accomplished using high pressure, e.g. preferably well above 4000, as, for exemple, 8000 or more psi and conventional moulding techniques. An exemple of bimeta die casting appears in U.S. 3,069,209. After die casting, the casting is normalized per conventional T 5 to relieve casting stresses, the steel drum back is coined, and the braking ring is final machined and balanced. Advantageously, the drum normally requires less than a usual amount of balancing because of inherent balancing accomplished by the casting. Acomposite brake drum as hereinbefore described and set forth in the drawings was tested unaer extreme service conditions and four to be suitable for commercial use on motor vehicles, particularly compact or subcompact automobiles as well as in trucks, and large vehicles. The brake drum exhibits front rear temperature, balance, fade pressures, and pedal travels similar to heavier cast iron Arums of comparable design features. Further, the composite drum withstood prolonged high thermal inputs, thermal shock e.g. twenty five fade stops follwed by immediate immersion in water and abusive mountainn driving without failing. In short, the composite brake dram herein provides reduced weight an cost as compared to ones having cast drum back while providing a higly acceptable and commercially desirable brake drum performance. The selection of materials for use in the manufacture of the components of the brake drum of the invention allow the production of brake drums of reduced weight without requiring an increase in wheel tread dimensions. Moreover, the drum can be balanced using conventional welding tehcniques and can be secured 1. using conventional axle flange attachements so that it can be re moved for servicing without difficulty.
