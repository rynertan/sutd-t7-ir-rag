# Data processing apparatus including storage with address mapping by block.

## Abstract
In a data storage system employing sequential data transfers for blocks of data bytes, an address offset is in duced in the addressing mechanism such that each block 21 transfer requires loading the address mechanism with an address of a block to be accessed. Address offset is preferably induced by inserting a blank register 27 , which may be preceded by an error correction detection word 22 , between adjacent blocks.
