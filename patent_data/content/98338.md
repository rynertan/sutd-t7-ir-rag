# Low viscosity stable aqueous dispersion of graft carbon black.

## Abstract
Aqueous dispension of carbon black grafted with hy drophilic monomers such as alkali or ammonium car boxylate bearing polymers. The dispersion has a viscosity of about 2 to about 30 cP for a carbon black content of about 1 15 by weight.
