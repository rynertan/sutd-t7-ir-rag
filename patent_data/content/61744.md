# TRANSISTOR INVERTER DEVICE

## Abstract
In a transistor inverter device, at its start immediately after a power switch 1a is turned on, an output level of a drive circuit 23 is low. A transistor 43 in a control circuit 41 for its start is conductive and a voltage dividing circuit constituted with resistors 42,44 operates. An output from a full wave rectifier 34 is voltage divided by the resistors 42, 44 . The divided voltage is applied to the cathode of Zener diode 36 . Such an operation of the control circuit 41 prevents an inverter stopping circuit 33 from erroneously operating at the time of the start of the inverter device.
