# Trackball device.

## Abstract
A trackball device includes a housing containing a plurality of rotatable supports and a ball seated thereon with a portion of the ball projecting through an opening in the housing for manual rotation by a user. First and second ones of the supports comprise shafts respectively rotatable about orthogonally related axes, the shafts being rotatably mounted in bearings receivable in slots in the housing accommodating slight movement thereof in directions per pendicular to the plane of the ball opening. Bias springs resiliently urge the bearings, and thereby the shafts and ball toward the ball opening. The device may also include illumination means and a light transmitting ball.
