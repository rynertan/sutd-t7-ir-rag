# Electrical connector with a release member.

## Abstract
The connector which is formed from sheet material comprises a receptacle portion 1 with a base 11 and a pair of upstanding side walls 13 with turned in edge por tions 15 . The receptacle portion 1 is suitable to receive a flat tab male terminal 5 from a front end and comprises a resilient tongue 21 which is released from the base 11 and which extends rearwardly from the front of the base and comprises a projection 25 which is capable of cooperating with a cut out 27 formed in the terminal 5 in order to lock this terminal 5 . At the area of the side edges 33 of the re silient tongue 21 first tags 37 are released from the base 11 so that the connector can be made suitable to receive flat male tab terminals of different widths by performing only a simple finishing operation. For wide terminals the first tags 37 are completely removed from the base 11 , whilst for narrow terminals they are bent upwards from the base so that they extend approximately parallel to the side walls 13 .
