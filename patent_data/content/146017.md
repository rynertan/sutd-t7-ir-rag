## Description
Plant growth regulator and method for increasing crop yields and promoting root formation The present invention relates to a plant growth regulator and a method for improving crop yields using the regulator. The immersion treatment of the seedlings of sweet potato Ipmoea batatas , with choline salts solution has been observed to improve crop yields Special Bulletin of the Chiba Ken Agricultural Experiment Station, No. 3, 1973 . Phosphorylcholine is used as a drug for treating diseases of the liver, but its use as a plant growth regulator is not previously known. Agricultural production can be characterized biologically as the collection of solar energy on the surface of the earth using the photosynthetic properties of green plants, and the supply of oxygen to the atmosphere. However, this is not always an efficient way to utilize solar energy. Taking a look at the world food situation, it is predicted that the world s population will approximately double by the end of the century, and that it will be extremely difficult to ensure the production of enough food to feed this population increase. A great deal of research has been devoted to coping with this anticipated population increase. Yet, mostR conducted with the aim of raising agricultural productivity has consisted of little more than improvements in production technology very little effort has been directed toward gaining a detailed understanding of the functions inherent to plants and how these can be enhanced. Plants generally make use of solar energy through photosynthesis to synthesize carbohydrates from water and carbon dioxide, and supply oxygen to the atmosphere. They also carry out respiration, which involves the absorption of atmospheric oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide. There are two types of plant respiration photorespiration, which occurs during exposure to light, and dark respiration, which occurs in dark places. Photorespiration has been observed only inC3 plants.Large amounts of carbon compounds are consumed by photorespiration. In fact, it has been reported that, in some types of plants, 50 of the assimilated carbon compounds are broken down by photorespiration. However, were it be possible to selectively inhibit photorespiration without adversely affecting other metabolic processes within the plant, this would allow one to raise the productivity of crops.Improvements in rice cultivation techniques have made it possible to grow rice in cold regions. However, the low temperatures sometimes prevent rice seedlings from taking root. In the course of research on stimulating the solar energy fixing function of green plants, the inventors discovered that choline salts, phosphorylcholine and its salts are able to increase the efficiency of plant photosynthesis to promote crop yields. The present inventors further discovered that the above mentioned compounds stimulate root formation and anchoring in rice seedlings. The present invention is based on the discoveries. One object of the present invention is to provide a plant growth regulator by which crop yields, the root formation and root anchoring in rice seedlings can be promoted. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of increasing crop yields and a method for regulating the growth of plants, such as promoting root formation and anchoring in rice seedlings. The present invention provides a plant growth regulator comprising as an effective ingredient a compound selected from the group consisting of a salt of choline, phosphorylcholine and a salt of phosphorylcholine. The present invention further provides a method of promoting crop yields by applying the above plant growth regulator to plants. The present invention still further provides a method of forming and anchoring roots of rice seedlings by applying the rice seedlings the above plant growth regulator. According to the present invention, the effective ingredient reduces the photorespiration of the plants to promote the crop yields, to promote the formation and anchorage of the rice seedling roots. The choline salts used as the active ingredients in the present invention may be inorganic salts such as hydrochloride, phosphate, polyphosphate, sulfate, nitrate, and carbonate salts. Organic salts such as acetate, citrate choline dihydrogen citrate , lactate, and L tartrate choline bitartrate salts can also be suitably used. Phosphorylcholine salts that may be used include phosphorylcholine chloride sodium salt and phosphorylcholine chloride calcium salt. The most desirable of these choline salts are the hydrochloride, the phosphate, and the choline bitartrate. Of these, the hydrochloride is especially desirable. Phosphorylcholine chloride sodium salt is desirable as a phosphorylcholine salt. Choline and phosphorylcholine per se are well known and commercially available, and salts thereof can be easilly produced by a conventional process.Phosphorylcholine can also be obtained by reacting choline with ortho phosphoric acid or its salt as disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure Kokai No.52 113924. The plant growth regulators of the present invention may be formulated for application in any known and conventional form, such as a powder, aqueous solution, or emulsion, or as a suspension in water or oil. Among the formulations just mentioned above, aqueous solution is most preferred. In the formulations, choline salt, phosphorylcholine or its salt may be contained in the amount of 1 wt to 75 wt . Further, the plant growth regulator of the present invention can contain another conventional agriculturally active ingredient such as fertilizer, insecticide, bactericide, and the like. In addition, a surfactant may preferably be contained in the amount of 1 wt to 20 wt to promote the adsorption and penetration of the active ingredient.Preferred surfactants may include nonionic surfactant such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ester and anionic surfactant such as lauryl sulfonic acid triethanolamine salt. The amount of the invented growth regulator to be applied varies with the type of plant, the stage of plant growth, the manner of application, the time of application and the molecular weight of the regulator, but normally ranges from 100 to 10,000 grams, and preferably from 500 to 4,000 grams of regulator per hectare. The growth regulator of the present invention is generally sprayed onto the stalks and leaves of the plant in the form of an aqueous solution. An aqueous solution containing 100 to 20,000 ppm, and preferably 300 to 10,000 ppm of the growth regulator is sprayed. When phosphorylcholine or a salt thereof is used to promote root formation, the seedlings are immersed in its aqueous solution of 1 to 500 ppm, and preferably 10 to 100 ppm. When choline salts are used to promote root formation or anchoring in rice seedlings, the roots of the rice seedlings are generally irrigated with an aqueous solution before being transplanted, and preferably at least 10 days before transplantation. The concentration of choline salts used in this case is 10 to 1,000 ppm, and preferably 25 to 200 ppm. Generally a good time to apply the plant growth regulators of the present invention is when photorespiration by the plant is at its peak. For instance, use at some point from the period of reproductive growth to the harvesting period for the plant is desirable.However, depending on the plant, use during the period of vegetative growth may provide more desirable effects.In other words, there are no specific limits on the period of administration. The plant growth regulator of the present invention can be used for C3 plants such as rice, wheat, beans, sugar beet, sweet potato, potato, onion and spring onion, i.e., plants that represent major food sources. When the plant growth regulator of the present invention is employed, it is capable of regulating the growth and also increasing the yields of C3 plants.Example 1Preparation of choline salts A mixture of 242 grams of 50 choline and 50 mQ of pure water was cooled to 50C in a nitrogen atmosphere and 110 g of 89 phosphoric acid was added thereto dropwise while stirring. This gave 402 grams of a 50 choline phosphate choline salt of phosphoric acid solution having a pH of 4.9. This aqueous solution was concentrated to give the phosphate salt. Aqueous solutions of various other choline salts shown in Table 1 below were prepared in the same way by using different acids. Each of these solutions was concentrated and crystals of the respective salts obtained. In cases where the salt was difficult to obtain as crystals, it was used in the form of an aqueous solution.

The rate of photorespiration was determined by measuring the rate of carbon dioxide discharge from the difference in carbon dioxide concentration at the chamber inlet and outlet while passing carbon dioxide free air through the chamber at a flow rate of one liter per hour. The carbon dioxide concentration was measured with an infrared carbon dioxide analyzer. The prepared compounds were dissolved to various concentrations in distilled water, and adjusted to a pH of 7. One milliliter of solution was injected with a syringe through a silicone rubber plug into the moist portion of the cotton within the leaf chamber. The normal rate of photorespiration of rice leaf blades was about 2.7 mg of CO2 per square decimeter dmê per hour. Table 2 shows the percent inhibition of photorespiration by the prepared compounds.
