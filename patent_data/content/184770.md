# A panty brief and a method of making same.

## Abstract
A panty brief consists wholly or partly of elastic textile ma terial, preferably made by knitting or crocheting, and is formed as a flat, substantially rectangular bag which is closed along three marginal zones 2, 3, 4 . The bag is open in the whole ex tension of one longitudinal edge to provide a waist opening 7 at the non connected marginal zones 6 , and is provided with two leg openings 11 . To produce such a panty brief, having inclined leg open ings and a good fit, without any form of after fashioning, inex pensively and by automatic machines, the leg openings 11 are located opposite one another in the two sides 1 of the bag in a position between the marginal zone 6 and the oppo site marginal zone 4 so that two of the interconnected margi nal zones 2, 3 are placed in the front and the back of the panty brief, while the third 4 is located in the crotch region 5 of the panty brief between the leg openings 11 .
