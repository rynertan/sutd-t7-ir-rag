# Method of transmitting an audio signal via a transmission channel.

## Abstract
A method of converting an audio signal into a binary signal and vice versa. During conversion samples of the audio signal are converted into data words comprising a plurality of amplitude bits and one sign bit. Subsequently each data word is divided into a plurality of N subwords, each subword comprising one of the N most significant amplitude bits of the data word. The data words thus obtained are modulated in accordance with the NRZ M modulation. The binary signal thus obtained excels in respect of bandwidth and the possibility of clock generation during demodulation.
