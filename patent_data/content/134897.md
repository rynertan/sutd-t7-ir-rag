# Method for allowing a program to be independent of the national language in which an input to the data processing system is received.

## Abstract
A distributed, interactive data processing system pro vided with the ability to allow concurrent multi lingual use by a plurality of users having different national language preferences is further provided with the ability to be independent of the national language in which an input to the data processing system is received. A message model data collection 18 is established by storing message models via a message identifier primary key and a secondary key that is the national language index. A central message service 17 is used to compose messages from message models retrieved from the message model data collection 18 using the primary and secondary keys in response to a call from an application 10 , application control 12 or supervisor 13 program. The calling program stores a message identifier primary key as the value of a variable and causes an event to be stacked for an event handler 19 . The event handler 19 uses the message identifier to request composition of that message from the central message service 17 . Central message service 17 determines the user s national language index which together with the message identifier allow the message model to be retrieved from the message model data collection 18 , and the message to be composed and stored in a variable accessible to the event handler 19 . The event handler 19 uses that information to store values in variables accessible to the calling program. The calling program can then use the contents of those variables to determine whether the user s input has meaning recognized by the program.
