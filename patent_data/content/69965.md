# Mobile navigator.

## Abstract
A mobile navigator comprises a distance detector 2 for generating a running distance signal, an azimuth detector 1 for generating a progression azimuth detecting signal, a CRT display 6 for indicating the current position of an automo tive vehicle, a microcomputer 4a for calculating the current position of the vehicle from the distance detecting signal and the progression azimuth detecting signal and supplying the current position signal to the display, and a memory 4b, 4c in which are stored a plurality of map data, earth s magnetic field declination information different for each area in association with the map data, and earth s magnetic field strength information.
