# Hydrous alcohol distillation method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An improved distillation method and apparatus are provided for recovering hydrous ethanol from fermentation or synthetic feedstocks. Substantial energy savings are realized by utilizing a pair of stripper rectifier towers 10,11 in which overhead vapors from one tower 10 operating at a higher pressure supply the heat required for the other tower 11 operating at a lower pressure and by preheating the feedstock in multiple heat exchange steps. The feedstock is split into two portions of unequal size, the larger portion being supplied to the higher pressure tower 10 and the smaller portion to the lower pressure tower 11 .
