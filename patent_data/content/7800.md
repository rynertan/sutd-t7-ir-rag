# Catalyst component and method of polymerisation.

## Abstract
A supported titanium catalyst component is produced by cogrinding an organo aluminum catalyst component with a supported titanium IV halide on a magnesium halide. The resulting supported titanium halide catalyst component, when employed with an organo aluminum catalyst compo nent to form a catalyst system is highly useful for the stereoregular polymerization of α olefins as well as the copolymerization of α olefins.
