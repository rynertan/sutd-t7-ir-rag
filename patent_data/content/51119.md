DescriFtion of the Preferred Embodiment With reference to Figure 1 of the drawings a large caliber cannon is shown in phantom line generally at 26 having a forward extending gun tube 27 and a conventional breech 28 at the rear end of the gun tube. An arcuateEMI6.1 shield 29 29 is shown as a part of the cannon, all of which is mounted to rotate about a trunnion or elevation axis 31 on a gun carriage fram work 30 partially broken away for clarity .The carriage is mounted f rotational movement on a circular track 32, also shown in phantom line, by bearing supports such as those known asConrad bearings. The cannon 26 may therefore be roved in azimuth about an azimuth axis shown at 33. The track is affixe to.a stable unders rface 34 such as the deck of a ship or the frame of a mobile armored vehicle. The foregoing is conventional, forming no part of this invention, and will not be described in greater detail as it is well known to those of skill in this art. In closed on the gun carriage, and thcrcfore movable therewith, is a projectile storage drun 36 partially broken away for clarity and a propellant charge stor rum 37 Figure 1 .A drum indexing drive 38 is provided for the drum 36 and an indexing drive 39 is provided for the drum 37. The in de ing drives move their respective drums to predetermined angular positions about he axes of the drums. Also rounted to the carriage framewerk 30 and operating in cooperation with the drums is a loader chain assembly 41 for the drum 36 and another loader chain assembly 42 for the drum 37.Associated with chain assembly 41 is a hydraulic drive cylinder 43 and associated with chain assembly 42 is a hy draulic drive assembly 44. The loader chain assemblies are provided to rcrnove projectiles and propellant charges from thcir respective storage druns and place the into a projectile transfer tray 46 and a propellant charge transfer tray 47 respectively. The transfer trays are pivotally mounted to a projectile cradle arm 48 and a propellant charge cradle art 49 respectively so that they may be swung between positions to receive the projectiles and propellant charges from the drums and a position aligned with the axis of the breech 28.Figure 1 shows the tray 46 aligned with the breech loading axis and the tray 47 aligned with a receiving position at the propellant charge drum 37. A hydraulic drive assembly 51 is seen in Figure 1 for driving the projectile transfer tray 46 between the aforementioned breech loading and receiving positions. A similar hydraulic drive mechanism is provided for the transfer tray 47, but is not shown in Figure 1. A hydraulic drive assembly 52 is mounted on the carriage 30 and is used to drive the cradle arm 48 about the elevation axis 31. A similar hydraulic drive 53 is mounted on the carriage the opposite side of the breech 28 and per forms the function of driving the propellant charge cradle arm 49 about the elevation axis.A damping and cradle arm position indication cylinder 54 is shown disposed between a breech trunnion 56 and the projectile cradle arm 48. A similar damping cylinder i provided for the propellant charge cradle arm 49 although it is not seen in the view ofFigure 1. A rammer chain 57, shown by hidden lines in Figure 1, is mounted on the projectile transfer tray 46 and is uriven by a hydraulic drive assembly 58 also mounted on the transfer tray.Similar structure, though not shown in Figure 1, in present on the propellant charge trarsfer tray 47. The rasher chains servo to unload rounds from the trays into te breech. It may therefore be seen that ammunition components stored ir. the storage drums 36 and 37 are index to a re ceivirag position for the trays 46 and 47 by the index drives 38 and 39. The ammunition components are roved from the drums into the transfer trays by the loader chains 41 and 42, and the loaded transfer trays are thereafter taken to the appropriate gun tube elevation by the cradle arms 4 and 49 as uriven by the drives 52 and 53 respectively.The transfer trays are then driven in sequence to the loading axis for the breech 28 by the drive 51 and by a similar drive for the tray 47. The ammunition components are thereafter moved from the trays and projected into the breech opening by action of the rammer chains 57 as driven by the hydraulic drives 58, it being realized that a similar rammer chain and drive is provided for the transfer tray 47 as is shown for the transfer tray 46. MEC ANICAL SUBSYSTEMS Figure 2 shows the rear of the projectile storage drum 36 looking forward toward the breech 28 of the cun. For the purposes of this disclosure, the projectile handling portion of the system only trill be described as the proper lant charge handling portion of the system is substantially a mirror image structurally. The storage drum 36 has a plurality of storage sleeves or chambers 59 therein which are arranged in two circular patterns, as shown. The outer circular array of chamhers is twelve in number and the inner array numbers six. The drum 36 is mounted on the gun carriage 30 for rotating movement thereon, as best seen inFigure 7. The drum 36 has a plurality of reinforcir.q seg ments 61 Fig. 7 on the drum periphery.A forward end wall 62 and a rcarward end wall 63 on the drum have openings therein aligned with the sleeves 59. The sleeves may be seen to be adapted to hold proaectiles shown in phantom lint at 64. The rear wall 63 has a boss 66 extending therefrom to which is attached a drum indexinq gear 67. The inner surface of the boss 66 carries a bearing retainer 69 which engages and retains a rear drum bearing 68 therein.A rear drum pivot 71 is attached to the carriage 30 and has a stepped outer cylindrical surface which engages the inner surface of the bearinq retaincr 69. The forward wall 62 of the drum also has a boss 72 formed thereon which has an inner periphery formed to acccpt a forward drum bearing 73 for the drum 36. The inner surface of the bearing 73 is picked up by a shouldered stub shaft 74 which extends from the carriage 30. A bearing retainer 76 is attached to the end of the stub shaft for the rpoc of capturing the bearing 73 between the end of the stub shaft and the shoulder thereon.Drum 36 may therefore be seen Fig. 7 to be capable of rotating on the bearinrjs 68 and 73 relative to the gun carriage framework 30. Thc project les 64 after being lodded into the chambers 59 within the drum 36 mut be held securely within the chambers until such tine as they ard selected to be removed. Figure 6 is a partial section through the leri phery of the urum 36. As seen in Figure 2, the section ofFigure 6 is taken through a slotted screw 77 which also appears ir Figure 6 at the left side thereof. The screw 77 engages internal t lrcads within a tube 78 which extends between the forward and rear walls 62 and 63 of the drum 36.The tube 78 is further supported between the end walls of the drun by the reinforcing s gments 61 as seen in Figsure 6. The slottcd screw 77 may be adjusted longitudinally on the internal threads within the tube 78 bearing against one end of a compression coil spring 79. The other end of the coil spring bears against a rod 81 within the hollow tube which is movable longitudinally therewithin. The rod 81 engages a pair of levers 82 at mid points therealong.The levers extend through openings in the wall of the tube 78 and are pivoted at pivot points 83 on the tube. The levers 82 actuate a parallelogram linkage shown generally at 84 which has a stabilizing shoe 86 on one side thereof.There is an opening 87 in the wall of each of the chambers 59 which is in registration with the stabilizing shoe 86 and through which the shoe may extend. It may be seen that longitudinal movement of the rod 81 within the tube 78 moves the stabilizing shoe 86 in a radial direction relative to the chamber 59. Since the rod 81 is spring loaded in the direction of tiie arrow 89 in Figure 6, the stabilizing shoc is normally moved radially outward so that it cocs not contact the surface of a projectile 64 within the chamber. Figure 6 also shows a latch member 90 att ched to the forward wall 62 at 1 pivot 89. T ic latch member 90 is urged in a clockwise dircction as shown in Figure 6 by a torsion spring not shown . The end of the movable rod.81 which is proximate to the latch member has a detent 91 therein for receiving one nd of the latch nember. As a result, when the movable rod is pushed in a dircction to compress the spring 79, the latch member 90 is urged by the torsion spring to enter the detent 9L and retain the rod against the compressed spring 79. The stabilizing shoc 86 is thereby moved radially inward to contact the surface of a projectile 64 within the chamber 59 and hold it firmly within the chamber. As also seen in Figure 6, the movement of the rod 81 acts against a third lever 92 which passes through the wall of the tube 78 and is mounted on the tube at a pivot point 93. The lever 92 actuates an arm 94 which is retracted as shown in Figure 6 when the latching merber 90 is out of the etent 91 anti the rod 81 has been urged by the spring 79 in the direction of the arrow 88. however, when the latch is allowed to move into the detent 91 when the rod 81 is forced in a dircction counter to the arrow 88, the arm 94 is extended and passes through an opening 96 in the wall of the chanber 59 to contact the ogivo of the projectile 64 thereby assisting in securely holding the projectile 64 within the chamber 59. The rods 81 are unlatches Curing loading of projectiles into the chanbers ana are thereafter forced against the compression springs 79 until the latch members 90 engage the detents 91. As further shown inFigure 6, the latch member 90 of each projectile holding mechanism is released by engagement with an unlatching pawl 97.The unlatchiny pawl is attachedto the piston in a hydraulically actuated unlatching cylinder 98 so that when th piston is urged hydraulically to move in the iirce tion of the arrow 99, the mcchanism for holding a projectile within a chamber is released. Turning now to the mechanism which indexes the ammunition storage drum 36, reference is made to Figure 4 wherein an exploded view of the drum index drive 38 is shown. The storage drum is preferably driven in one direction only and the drive 38 therefore includes a mechanism for transferring the drive torque there through in one direc tion only. A hydraulically actuated piston 101 has a backup roller 102 in pressure contact with one side of the piston. A rack 103 is formed on the other side of the piston.The rack is positioned in engagement with a pinion gear 104 which is attached to and roates with a notched clutch member 106. A small magnet 107 is attached to one end of the piston 101 so that when the piston is in the position shown in Figure 4, the magnet will be adjacent to a proximity switch 108. When the magnet is adjacent to the proximity switch, the switch is in one state, whereas when the mag nct is distant from the svitcll, it is in another state. A second small magnet 109 is seen on the opposite end of the piston 101 which functions in like fashion with a second proximity switch 111. Thus, an indication of piston position is provided by the switches. A Cog clutch member 112, having a peripheral groove 113 therearound, is mounted on a splined shaft 114.The uog clutch member is disposed for axial motion on the splints of the shaft. The clutch member 112 is moved axially on the splines by the rotation of an engage disengage shaft 116 which has a radial arm 117 extending therefrom.A block 118 is pivotally counted at the outcr end of the arm 117 and is termed to fit into the groove 113 on the dog clutch member. when the shaft 116 is rotated through an are in a clockwise direction, as seen in Figure 4, the dog clutch member will move toward and engage with the notched clutch member 106, and rotation of the pinion gear 104 induced b actuation of the piston 101 will be transmitted through the splined shaft 114 to a drum drive gear 119. The drive gear is engaged with the drum index gear 67 mounted on the drum 36 so that when the drive gear 119 is rotated, the drun is indexed to a new rotational position. The manner in which the shaft 116 is caused to rotate through an appropriate arc is accomplished through the use of an engage disengage hydraulic actuator 121 having an arm 122 extending therefrom which is selectively extended or retracted hydraulically. The arn 122 is connected to an expanding linkage 123 which is pivotally connected at one end to a point on the periphery of the shaft 116 and is pivotally connecteci at the other end to the housing for the drum index drive 38. The linkage 123 pivots ap proxir.atcly mid way of its length at which poir.t it is connected to the end of the arm 122.Retraction of the arn 122 will foreshorten the linkage 123, causing the arm 117 to rotate clockwise, as seen in Figure 4, and to thereby engage the dog clutch 112 with the notched clutch member 106. In this condition, rotation irparted to the pinion i04 b movement of the hydraulic piston 101 will be transmitted through the drun index drive 38 to the drum index year 67 and the drum will be turned. Conversely, extension of the arm 122 will cause lie cngaCjc disengacje shaft 116 to rotate through an arc in a countcrclockwise direction, thereby disengaging the clutch members.In this condition movement of the hydraulic piston 101 till cause the pinion to rotate, but will not transmit rotational torque through the index crive to the drum index gear 67.. Attached to the end of the engage disengage shaft 116 is a fixture 124 in which arc mounted a pair of magnets i26 and 127 Figure 4 . The magnets are associated with proximity switches 25i and 252 shown in Figure 13 which are similar to switches 108 and 111 so that when the clutch members are engaged, the switch associated with magnet 126 will be actuated and when they are disengaged, the stitch associated with magnet 127 will be actuated. Also attached to the end of the shaft 116 is a drum lock actuating arm 128 which has pivotally attached thereto a drum lock actuation rod 129.A drum lock ncnber 131 is pivotally attached to the other end of the drum lock rod and is also pivotally attached to the gun carriage 30 at a pivot point 132. It may be seen that when the engage disengage cylinder 121 urges the arm 122 to extend, thereby disengagins the clutch members in the drum index drive 38, the drum lock member 131 is placed in firm engagement with the drum index gear 67. Altcrnatively, when the arn 122 is retracted, the drum lock member is pivoted to a position out of engagement with the teeth of the drum index gear. Thus, with the clutch members of the drum index drive engaged, the drum index gear is unlocked and the drun may be indexed t the driven, and with the clutch members disengaged the drum index gear is locked and the drum is fixed in angular position. Referring to Figure jr, the actual physical arrangements of the components in the drum index drive of Figure 4 are shown A housing 133 cncloscs the torquf transfer crain and defines a chamber 134, in a preferred embodiment, which is normally fillcd with oil. The housing contains a number of static oil seals which scal appropriate housing covcrs, etc. A dynamic oil seal 136 is shown surrounding the output end of the splined shaft 114. The rack 103 on the hydraulically driven piston 101 is seen engaged on one side by the back up roller 102, which is firmly mounted in the housing, and on the other side by the teeth of the pinion gear 104.The pinion gear is attached to the notched clutch member 106 which has a hollow cylindrical form the intcrnal surface of which engages the outer races of a pair of bearings 137 and 138. The inner races of the bearings 137 and 138 engage the periphery of the splined shaft 114 which extends therethrough.The output end of the splined shaft 114 is supported in the rousing by a bearing 140 situated next to the seal 136.The shaft 114 is supported in the housing at the end opposite the output end by another bearing 139. The engage disengage shaft 116 is supported at opposite ends Jy bearings which are mounted in the wall of the housing 133.The end of the shaft 116 that carries the rr.agnet holding fixture 124 extends through a dynami seal in the Iiousing so that the magnets 126 ans 127 are external to the housing and located near the previously mentioned pair of proximity switches. The housing includes a removable sealed cover 141 surrounding the output end of the splined shaft 114. R ferring to Figure 4 of the drawings, and operating sequence for the drum index drive 38 ill be undertaken. It will be apparent to those of skill in tliis art that an appropriate stroke distance of the piston 101 together with appropriate numbers of teeth and pitch diameters oil the pinion gear 104, drum drive scar 119 and drum index gear 67 will provide for a desired angular movement of the storage drum 36 to place a projectile in proper position to be received by tile transfer tray 46 when positioned at a receiv ins position for either the inner or the outer circular array of chambers 59.Presuming for purposes of illustration that the arum index gear 67 is to be rotated in a clockwise direction, as seen in Figure 4, when indexing chambers within the storage drum to a position for transfer of projectiles, it may be seen that magnet 107 is initially positioned close to proximity switch 108 thcrcby actuating the switch. Actuation of this switch causes the pressure which has driven te piston 101 into the position as shown in Figure 4 to be shut off.When a control signal is subsequently transmitted to the system which corresponds to an initiation of a drum indexing cycle, pressure is caused to be transmitted to the engage disengage cylinder 121 which causes the arm 122 to retract within the cylinder, thereby drawing the linkage 123 upwardly at tic center and causing engage disengage shaft 116 to rotate clockwise thus cngaging the dog clutch member 112 with the notched clutch member 106.The lock 131 which rotationally fixes the drum index gear 67 is disengaged jy tic clockwise rotation of the shaft 116 through the linkage herdinbefore deseribed. The small mag nct 126 is thereby position close to the engage proxi nity switch 251 in Figure 13 actuating the switch. The signal from this switch actuation enables pressure to be delivered to the side of the piston 101 wnich drives. thy piston so that the magnet 109 is brought proximate to the proximity switch 111. This may be seen to drive the pinion gear 194 in a counterclockwise direction Figure 4 . Tnis rotary motion is transferred through the clutch nen bers to the drum drive gear 119. When the drum drivc gear rotates counterclockwise its engagement with the Grum index gear 67 is seen to drive the latter gear in a clock wise direction. Actuation of the switch 111 provides a signal which rcroves the pressure from the right hand side of tile piston 101 as seen in Figure 4 and which enables pressure to be delivered to the engage disengage cylinder 121 which extends the arm 122 to thereby scraighten the expandable linkage 123.The linkage notion causes the shaft 116 to rotate in a counterclockwise direction Figures 4 or 5 thereby moving the arm 117 counterclockwise and the dog clutch member 112 axially along the splined snaft 114 to a position out of engagement taith the notched clutch merger 106. This potion brings the magnet 127 close to a proximity switch 252 in Figure 13 which enables pressure to be applied against the end of cylinder 101 to drive the cylinder back to the position shown in Figure 4. Since the clutch members are disengaged the pinion gear 194 is driven rotationally by passage of the rack 103 but the drum arive gear and drum index sear are not driven. Further, the drum lock member 131 is caused to engage the teeth of the index car 67 when the shaft 116 rotates counterclock wise. Thus the index gear is not only disengaged from the drum drive while the drive piston 101 transits through the return strokc, hut it is positively locked in angular position The cycle is complete now as magnet 107 once again comes into a position adjacent proximity switch 108 thereby terminating the pressure which has driven the cylinder 101 to the right in Figure 4 and enabling pressure to the cylinder 121 which when delivered will retract the arm 122 and engage the clutch members for the next storage drum indexing cycle. The structure which performs the function of transferring the projectiles 64 from the projectile storage drum 36 is best described hy first referring to Figure 7 of the drawings. As stated hereinbefore, since the structure for transferring the propellant charges from the charge storage drum 37 is substantially the same, only the projectile transfer will be described. An outer loader chain track 142 is shown attached at one end to the gun carriage framework 30 and at the other end surrounding an outer loader chain drive sprocket 143 which is supported to rotate about an axis 144.A loader chain 146 is carried within the track 142 and is engaged by the teeth on the drive sprocket 143. A loader pawl 147 is attached to and moves with the loader chain 146.The loader pawl extends through a slot 148 formed in the track from the sprocket to the end of the track attached to the gun carriage. An inner chamber loader chain track 149 is also seen in Figure 7 having one end secured to a bracket 151 attached to the end of the shouldered stub shaft 74. The inner chamber track passes around the rotation axis 144, and the other end is fastened hy means of a EMI18.1 support member 150 to theEMI18.2 at a point adjacent to the rcarward end of the drum. An inner hamecr loader chain 152 is disposed within the inner track having a pawl 153 attached thereto which travels with the Inner chain.A slot 154 is formed in the inner chamber loader chain track.and the pawl 153 passes therethrough so that it may travel from approximately the position shown in solid line in Figure 7 to the position shown in phantom line.The travel of the pawl 147 in the slot in the outer chamber track is approximately the same as the travel of the inner chamber pawl 153. As seen in Fiqure 7 the pawls 147 and 153 are positioned so that they lie behind the rearward end of projectiles 64 positioned in one of the outer and inner rings of chambers 59 respectively. With reference toFigure 2 there are slots 189 in the outer surface of the projectile storage drum 36 communicating with each chamber 59. The pawl 147 extends through the one slot 189 which is aligned with the outer chamber loader chain track slot 148 to contact the projectile within the outer ring in the storage drum. There are also slots 191 at the inner surface of the, projectile storage drum 36 in communication with each of the inner chambers 59. The pawl 153 passes through the one slot 191 which is aligned with the inner chamber loader chain track slot 154 to contact a projectile within an inner chamber 59.It follows then that if either the outer chamber loader chain 146 or the inner chamber loader chain 152 is driven so as to push one of the loader pawls along one of the slots 148 and 154, a projectile will be ejected by the pawl from a chamber 59 through one of the openings, aligned therewith in the front wall 62. After being advanced to eject a projectile 64 from one of the chambers 59 and the pawl is retracted to the positions shown in solid line in Figure 7. The mochanism for advancing and retracting the loader chain pawls is best shown with refercnccs to Figures 2 and 3. The loader chain assembly 41 includes a loader chain gear assembly 156 to which the outer and inner charge ber chain tracks 142 and 149 respectively are attached.The gear asscmbl has an outer housing 157 which is fixed to the gun carriage. Within the outer housing is an inner housing 158 which is rotatable with respect to the outer housing on a pair of supporting end bearings 159. A loader chain drive shaft 161 extends through the inner housing along tile axis 44 and is mounted therein by means of bearings 162 positioned at opposite ends of the inner housing. The loader chain drive shaft has a pinion gear 163 Figure 3 attached to that end of the shaft which extends rom the inner housing 158. The pinion gear is coupled to a piston driven rack within the hydraulic drive cylinder 43 in the same fashion as that, illustrated for the pinion gear 104 of.the drum index drive 38 in Figure 4. The inner housing .58 may therefore be seen to be capable of rotation about the axis 144 within the outer housing 157 Figure 2 . The shaft 161 is also capable of rotation about the axis 144 within the inner housing. The oxter housing wall has an annular passage 164 Figure 7 extending through an arc slightly over 180Âµ which is in cor.. runication at each end with the outer chamber loader chain track 142.The loader chain 146 therefore extends through the chain track and the annular passage and is brought into contact with the teeth on the sprocket 143 as mentioned hereinbefore, The outer housing also has a second annular passage 166 see Figure 14 extending through an are slightly more than 900 which is in communication with the inner ciiantber loader chain track 149. The inner chamber loader chain 152 therefore extends through the inner chain track and the annular passage 166.An inner chamber loader chain drive sprocket 167 is disposed on the inner housing 158 to pick up the inner chamfer loader chain 152 within the annular passage 166 Figure 14 . The inner housing 158 is a scaled housing containing oil therewithin for lubrication of gears contained in the housing which will be hereinafter described. An upper portion of the housing is shown in Figure 2 consisting of the outer chamber loader chain drive sprocket 143 which is formed so that it has a hollow shaft on one end surrounded by the inner race of the upper bearing 159 at the outer periphery and the Outer race of the upper bearing 162 at the inner periphery. The cuter end of the drive sprocket ,43 consists of a depending skirt 168 Figure 3 .The loader portion o the inner housing 158 consists of the inner chamber loader chain drive sprocket 167 which has a skirt 169 extending upwardly and fitting into the inner diameter of the skirt 168. An oil seal 171 Figure 2 is disposed between the skirts 168 and 16 so that oil contained within the chamber formed by the inner housing 158 is retained therein while the sprockets 143 and 167 rotate relative a one another. , hollow shaft extends downwardly from the sprocket 167. The inner race of the lower bearing 159 sJpports the hollow shaft at its outer per phery and the outer race of the loader hearing 162 supports the hollow shaft at its inner periphery. The shaft 161 extends between and throuqh the bearings 162. An oil, seal 172 is also provided between the inner housing 158 and the shaft 161 where the shaft exits from the housing. An exploded perspective view of the inner housing 158 with some of the structure removed to provide clarity is shown in Fiqure 3. The outer chamber drive sprocket 143 is the inner housing portion which engages the upper bearings 162 and 159, and a segment of the sprocket is removed so that a view into the inside of the inner housing is provided. A ring gear 173 is formed on the inner wall of the sprocket 143. The shaft 161 has four radially extending arms thereon 174, 176, 177 and 178. An idler gear 179 is retained between the arms 174 and 177 and is free to rotate about an axis parallel to axis 144 and extendinq between the arms. The idler gear is meshed with the ring gear 173.A double planetary gear is contained between the arms 176 and 178 having an upper planetary gesr 181 and a lower planetary gear 182. The idler gear 179 is sufficiently long axially so that the upper planetary gear 181 is meshed therewith. The lower planetary gear 182 is meshed with a lower ring gear 183 formed on the inner periphery of the inner chamber loader chain drive sprocket 167. The upper and lower planetary genrs are seen to rotate together on a common shaft 184 about an axis parallel to axis 144. A slide 186 Figures 3 and 14 is provided which moves parallel to the axis 144. A pair of notches 187 and 188 are formed therein Figure 3 . Slide 186 is axially adjustable so that the notch 187 can be positioned to allow the teeth on the sprocket 143 to pass therethrough while simultancously engaging and locking the sprocket 167 with a portion of the slide being inscrted between two of the teeth on the last named sprocket The slide is also adjustable in position so as to lock the outer chamber loader chain drive sprocket 143 rotationally by positioning the slide betwecn two of the teeth of the sprocke t while at the sane time positioning the lower notch 188 so that the teeth of the inner chamber loadcr chain drive sprocket 167 pass there through allowing the latter sprocket to rotate about the axis 144. With reference once again to Figures 2 and 3, the manncr in which the slide 186 is positioned longitudinally to determine which of the loader chains 146 or l.2 is to be driven to thereby transfer a projectile 64 from either an outer chamber or an inner chamber respectively will be explained. With the slide 186 in a lowered position as shown in Figure 3 so that the teeth in the sprocket 143 pass through the notch 187 and so that the lower portion of the slide 186 is lodged between two teeth of sprocket 167, the drive sprocket for the inner chamber loader chain 152 is locked.The rack in the hydraulic drive cylinder 43 is driven past the pinion gear 163 to impart a clockwise rotation to the shaft 161 as seen in Figure 3. The lower planet gear 182 walks around the rint gear 183 thereby turning the lower planet gear in a counterclockwise direction. The upper planct gear 181 is therefore alo turned in a counterclockwise ciirection through the connecting shaft 184. The upper planct 181, bcing meshed with the iulcr gear 179, drives the idler year 179 in a clockwise direction.The idler gear bcinr, meshed with the ring cear 173 therefore cries the outer charr.ber loadr chain drive sprocket 143 in a clockwise direction. This may be seen to cause the outer chamber loader chain 146 to advance in the outer chamber loader chain track 142. The pawl 147 is brought into contact with the rear surface of one of the projectiles 64, and as the pawl advances through the slot 139 the pro jectile is ejected from the chamber 59 into the projectile transfer tray 46 when the tray is positioned in the outer ring receiving position.When the rack within the hydraulic drive cylinder 43 is returned the pinion 163 and the shaft 161 are rotated in a counterclockwise direction and the gearing retracts the loader chain 146 to return the pawl 147 to the position shown in solid lines in Figure 7. When the slide 186 is elevated so that the teeth on the sprocket 167 pass through the notch 188 in the slide, the slide is positioned between a pair of teeth on the periphery of the sprocket 143 locking it rotationally.In this situation when the rack within the drive cylinder 43 is driven in a direction to turn tic pinion gear 163 in a clockwise direction the idler gear 179 is caused to walk ,around the ring gear 173 on the inside of the locked sprocket i43. The idler is thus rotated in a counterclockwise direction thereby causing the upper planct gear 181 with which it is meshed to rotate in a clockwise direction. The upper planet gear drives the lower planet gear 182 in a clockwise direction tiirough the connectinci shaft 184. Tile rotation of the lower planet gear meshed with the lower ring gear 183 causes the lower ring gear to also move in a clockwise direction.Clockwise rotation of the inner chamber loader chain drive sprocket 167 drives the inner chamber louder Chain 152 in a direction to advance the pawl 153 through the slot i91 to the position shown in phantom line in Figure 7. The advance of the pawl 153 due to the extension of the loader chain 152 causes the pawl 153 to contact the rear side of a projectile 64 in an inner chamber 59 thereby transferring it from the chamber into the projectile transfer tray 46 positioned at an inner ring receiving position.When the rack within the hydraulic cylinder 43 is caused to return to its original position, thereby driving the pinion.163 in a counterclockwise direction, the Iqader chain 152 is retract, as is evident from the foregoing explanation, and the pawl 153 is returned to the position shown in solid lines in Figure 7. As mentioned hereinbefore the transfer trays 46 and 47 are rotatable on the cradle arns 48 and 49. Tray 46, for exar ple, is rotatable about an axis 192 as best seen in Figures land 8. A hinge point and hydraulic slip joint 193 Figure 8 is provided which transfer3 hydraulic pressure, from the cradle arm 48 to the projectile transfer tray 46. A shaft 194 is supported on bearings within a housing 196 which is counted on the cradle arm. The shaft is fixed to the try 46 as it passes through a toncue 197 depending from the tray. The end of the shaft 194 is supported for rotation within another tongue 198 extending from the cradle arn 48. The opposite end of the shaft 194 has mounted thereto a tray position content member 199 which rotates with the shaft. Also fixed on the shaft is a pinion gear 201 shown by dashed lines in Figure 8 and located within tho housing 196.A hydraulic transfer tray drive cylinder 202 is shown which is part of the hydraulic drive assembly 5 for the projectile transfer tray 46 and which contains a piston and a rack gear sinilar to the arrangc mcnt of the piston 101 and the rack gear 103 of Figure 4.The rack is engaged with the pinion gear 201 to drive the tray 46 rotationally about the axis 192. A hydraulic tray lock cylinder 203 is seen inFigure 8 mounted on the cradle arm 48. The lock cylinder operates to selectively extend and retract a tray position latch 204. In the view of Figute 9 looking rearwardly toward the projectile transfer tray 46, the tray position latch is shown in the retracted position. The tray is driven to an angular position relative to the cradle arm by appropriate application of hydraulic pressure to one end or the other of the piston in the transfer tray drive cylinder 202 and the lock cylinder is hydraulically actuated when tho desired tray angular position is approached to extend the tray position latch 204 to engage the tray position detent member 199.Figure 9 shows the tray 46 in solid lines aligned with a receiving position to acccpt a projectile 64 from one or the chairbers 59 in the outer ring of chambers in the projectile storage drum 36. When the tray is to be retained in this position the position latch 204 is cxtended by the lock cylinder 203 to engage an outer position detent 206 in the detent member 199. With the projectile transfer tray shown in the position indicated at 46 in Figure 9 the position latch 204 is extended to cngage a shoulder 207. In this position the tray is aligned with a chamber 59 in the inner ring of chmbers within the projectile forage drum.With the transfer tray positioned at 46 of Figure 9 thc position latch is extended to engage a shoulder 209 on he Cetent member 199 thereby locking the tray in a loading position with the axis of the tray aligned with the breech 28 of the cannon when the cradle arm 48 is at the elevation of the gun tube 27.The transfer tray 46 may therefore be seen to swing about the tray axis 192 Figure 8 to assure one of the two receiJing positions 46 at the outer ring of chambers and 4S at the inner ring of chambers 59 and a loading position 46 Figure 9 wherein the tray axis is in a plane which is orthogonal to the elevation axis 31 Figure 1 and which includes the loading axis for projectiles and propellant charges extending centrally through the breech 28 Figure 1 . Clearly, if the gun tube 27 and the breech 28 are driven to some position away from zero elevation, a projectile received at one of the positions 46 or 46 inFigure 9 will not be aligned with the loading axis through the breech 28 if merely rotated about the tray pivot axis 192 to the position 46 . While the axis through the transfer tray at position 46 will be in the plane which is orthogonal to the elevation axis 3,1 and which includes the loading axis through the breech it will not be aligned with the loading axis. Since such alignment is necessary before the round can be rammed into the breech, the cradle arm 48 must be driven about thc elevation axis 31 to bring the axis of the transfer tray to the sare elevation as the gun tube and the breech.To accomplish the proper position ing of the transfer tray 46 so that it is aligned with the loading axis the cradle arm 48 is driven by the cradle arm hydraulic drive assembly 52 which includes a drive gear 211 as seen in Figure 8. The cradle arm drive assembly 52 is mounted on the gun carriage framework 30 as hereinbefore described aiid contains a hydraulically driven piston similar to piston 101 in Figure 4. A rack and pinion arrangement similar to the rack and pinion 103 and 104 of Figure 4 is provide in the Crive assembly 52 and a shaft 212 is coupled to the drive gear 211. The drive gear engages a sector sear 213 mounted on the cradle arm 48 so that as the gear rotates the cradle arm will be moved angularly about the elevation axis 31.The breech trunnion 56, which is fixed to the gen tube 27, has a trunnion arm 214 extending therefrom. The damping and position indication cylinder 54 has an arm 216 extending therefrom which is pivotally connected to the end of the arm 214. The opposite end of the cylinder 54 is seen to be pivotally connected to the cradle arm 48 by means of a bracket 217. The damp ing and position indication cylinder 54 functions as the cradle arm is driven about the elevation axis 31, which function will be described in greater dotail hereinafter. Figure 8 shows the location of the rammer chain hydraulic drive cylinder 58 on the tray 46. The drive 5e is sinilar td the piston type rack and pinion drum index drive 38 including components corrcsponding to the piston 101, rack 103 and pinion 104 shown in Figure 4. The rammer chain rive pinion is mounted on an output shaft 218 which is coupled to a drive sprocket 219. A pair of idler sprocket ets 221 and 222 are mounted on the transfer tray 46. A guide sprocket 223 is mounted on the transfer tray at the forward end thereof and another guide sprocket 224 is mounted at the rearward end.The rammer chain 57 is routed around the drive sprocket 219, over the idler sprockets 221 and 222 ana around the front and rear guide sprockets 223 and 224. A bracket 226 is attached to the rancor chain and is shown in Figure 8 with the rammer chain drive in the retracted position. A ranker pawl 227 is pivotally attached by means of a pivot pin 228 to the bracket 226.The ranmer pawl has four roller guides 229, two located on each side of the rammer pawl. The roller guides are disposed to travel iii a track 231 which extends the major portion of the distance between the front and rear guide sprockets 223 and 224 for the rammer chain as seen inFigure 8. The rammer pawl 227 extends upwardly through a slot 232 in the lower portion of the projectile receiving passage of the transfer tray 46 as seen in Figure 11. The projectile receiving passage of tray 46 has two short slots 230 in the rearward end. Thcse slots allow the loader chain pawls 147 and 153 to advance into the tray for a short distance to properly position the projectiles just ahead of the rammer pawl.Thus, the rammer pawl 227 is disposed behind a projectile 64 contained within the transfer tray so that as the rammer chain 57 is driven to advance that section of the chain between the sprockets 224 and 223, the rann.cr pawl moves forwardly along the slot 232 to eject the projectile from the front of the transfer tray into the breech. Figure 11 shows the unlatching cylinder 98 mounted on the transfer tray 4C. The cylinder is mounted at the rearward end of the transfer tray as best shown inFigure 8. The piston within cylinder 98 is selectively hyuraulically extended thereby extending the unlatching, pawl 97 in the direction of the arrow 99 Figure 6 so that a projectile 64 within a chamber 59, is released by the shoe 86 and the ogive securing ars 94 as described hereinbefore. With the extension of the unlatching pawl, linkage is concurrently actuated which is described with reference to Figure 10.A depending arm 233 is attached to the cylinder piston also moving in the direction of the arrow 99 when the piston is extended. A drive link 234 connects the end of the arm 233 at a pivot point 236 with a fixed iink 237 and a movable link 238. While the fixed link 237 may pivot about its upper pivot, the upper pivot may not translate. The lower end of the movable link 238 is pivotally connected to a depressing arm 239. The arm is attached to a rod 240 which is attachcd to a movable section 241 of t le rolier guide track 231.Another movable section 242 is located on the opposite side of the track 231. Eoth sections may therefore be rotated about an axis through the rod 240. It ma y be seen that as the depending arn 233 moves in the direction of the arrow 99 upon actuation of the unlatching cylinder 98 the distance across the links 237 and 238 is fereshortened causing the depressing arm 239 to raise as seen in Figure 10. thus, the track section 241 is rotated in a counterclockwise direction as shown about the pivot pin 228 sce Figure 12 .The roller guides 229 being disposed within both track sections rotate about the pivot 22d together with track section 242, thereby depressing the ranger pawl 227 so that it is in a out of the way posi tion as the projcctile 64 is transf rred from one of the chambers 59 into the transfer tray 4G by one of the loader chain pawls 147 or 153. The action of the linkage to pro vidc depression of the rammer pawl when the unlatching cylinder 98 is actuated is shown in Figure 12. The projectiles 64 are literally thrown into tile breech 28 when the tray 46 is aligned with the loading axis of the breech. Por 155 millimeter projectiles a ve locity of approximately twenty two feet per second has been found to be appropriate for loading. The rarmer pawl 227 is accelerated to such a velocity before being arrested.The propellant charges are also thrown into the breech behind the projectiles, but at a somewhat lesscr velocity. HYDRAULIC ACTUATORS In the preferred embodiment the indexing of the magazine drums 36 and 37, actu ion of the loader chains 146 and 152, driving of the transfer trays 46 and 47, posi tioning of the cradle arms. 48 and 49, and driving of the rammer chains 57 are all accomplished hydraulically. Conventional hydraulic slip joints are used to transfer hy draulic pressure and return fluid from the deck 34 to the gun carriage 30, from the gun carriage to the gun tube 27 and breech 28, from the gun carriage to the cradle aries 48 and 49 and from the cradle arms to the transfer trays 46 and 47. The hydraulic slip joints will not be described in any detail since they are well within the knowledge of those with skill in this art. The actuation of the hydraulic drum indexing drives 38 and 39 for the projectile and propellant charge storage drums 36 and 37 will be described in conjunction with Figure 13. A hydraulic pressure line P and a return line T to the hydraulic reservoir tank are showy coupled to a valve block 243. The valve block is shown as a part of the drum index drive 38 for the storage drum 36 in Figure 13. A clutch engagement pilot valve 244 is shown in the actuated condition. Actuation of the pilot valve 244 is generally accomplished by a solenoid movement of the valve in the direction of the arrow 246.In the dcoctuated position as shown it may be seen that the clutch engage disengage cylinder 121 is pressurized through a hydraulic control valve 245 to move a piston 247 disposed therein in a direction providing clutch disengagement and as indicated by the arrow 248. The control valve 245 is spring loaded to the position shown in Figure 13 until the piston therein is displaced by actuation of a pilot valve. The pressure in cylinder 121 is aided by a coilcd spring 249 within the cylinder. It may be seen that with the piston 247 in the position shown in Figure 13 the arm 122 attached to the piston is extended from the cylinder and the clutch cambers i12 and 106 are ,disengaged as hereinbefore described.At tho salle tire the drum, lock member 131 is caused to engage the teeth of the drum index gear 67 through the motion of the drum lock actuation rod 129 as also hercinbefore described. The magnet 127 on the holding fixture 124 is therefore in a position to actuate a clutch disengage proximity switch 252. when the clutch engagement pilot valve 244 is solenoid actuated to move the valve in the direction of the arrow 246 pressure is applied to the right end of the control valve 245 as seen in Figure 13 to drive the valve member to the lert as seen therein. Pressure may now be seen to be applied through the lines to the right side of the piston 247, and the piston is driven in the direction indicatcci by the arrow 250.This action of the piston retracts the arm 122 simultaneously causing the clutch members 112 and 106 to engage and the drum lock member 131 two disengage from the teeth of the index gear 67. The magnet holding fixture 124 rotates clockwise as seen inFigure 13 thereby placing the magnet 126 proximate to a clutch engage proximity switch 251 and providing a switch output. A drum. index drive pilot valve 253 is shown in the de actuat d condition in Figure 13. With the pilot valve posi tioned as shown the right end of a control valve 254 is coupled to the return hydraulic line T tank pressure and a coil string 257 in the valve drives a piston 256 contained therein to the right Figure 13 . The pressure lino P is thereby communicated through the control vale 254 to the left end of a cylinder contained in the drum index drive 38 in which the piston 101 is disposed for longitudinal movement.The right end of the cylinder is seen to be con nectc to the return hydraulic line through the control valve 254. With the drum drive in this condition the proximity switch 108 is adjacent to the magnet 107 on the end of the piston 101 and provides an output indicative of the piston position. The pilot valve 253 is a solenoid actuated valve and is actuated in the direction of the arrow 258 Figure 13 when energized. When actuated the pilot valve 253 directs rressure to the valve 254 which moves the piston 256 therein against the coil spring 257. The pressure line which enters near te center of the valve 254 is thereby communicated with the adjacent line leading to the right end of the cylinder containing the piston 101. At the same tinge tlie lcft end of the cylinder is communicated with the tank or return line T through the valve 254.Conse quently the piston 101 and the rack 103 are driven to the left as shows. and the pinion gear 104 is rotatcd. When the piston has moved sufficiently to place the magnet 109 adjacent to the proximity switch 111, the switch provides an appropriate output. As heroinbefore described the move mcnt of the piston 101 to the left in Figure 13 occurs by actuation of pilot valve 253 when the clutch members i12 and 106 are engaged and the index gear 67 is unlocked to thereby turn the storage drum 36. It may be seen however that the direction of drive for the storaqe drum is dependent upon the sequence of the actuation of the pilot valves 244 and 253.If the pilot vale 244 is not actuated when the pilot valve 253 is actuated, then the left movement of the piston 101 would not index the storage druii 36. Complete flexibility or control is therefore provieed whereby the sequencing of the pilot valve actuation dictates the direction in which the storage drum 36 is indexed. The hydraulic circuits for the loader chain drives 41 and 42 are identical. Only the hydraulic sche matic for the chain drive 41 is shown in Figure 14. The lockiny slide 186 shown in figure 3 is depicted in Figure 14 attached to the end of a piston ar.l 259 which extends through the end of a sprocket locking cylinder 261 and is attached to a piston 262 contained therein. The piston is spring loaued by coil springs 263 o a center or neutral po sition within the cylinder. As shown in Fiyure 14 the slide 186 is in tlic neutral position engaging and locking Loth the outer and inner chamber loader chain drive sprockets 143 and 1G7. A sprocket unlocking pilot valve 264 is shown also in a neutral position so that tank return line T is communicated through a valve block 266 to both sides of the piston 262. Hydraulic prcssure P is also brought into the valve block 266.When the pilot valve 264 is solenoid actuated in the direction o. the arrow 267 hydraulic pressure is applied to the supper side o the piston 262 and the lower side is communicated with the hydraulic reservoir tank thereby driving the slidc 186 downwardly until the notch 187 is aligned with the teeth on the outer chamber drive, sprocket 143. It may be seen that the inner chamber drive sprocket 167 is still engaged by the slide 186.The outer chamber loader chain 146 may therefore be driven through the shaft 161 as hereinbefore described to eject a projectile 64 from a chamber 59 which has been indexed to align with the transfer tray positioned at the outer ring receiving position. It is clear from the foregoing that if the pilot valve 264 is driven in the direction of the arrow 268 the piston 262 will be moved upwardly within the cylin der 261 thereby aligning the notch 168 with the teeth on the inner chamber loader chain drive sprocket 167 while maintaining the sprocket 143 in a locked condition.It should also be noted in Figure 14 that magnets 269 and 271 are disposed to move with the slide 186 so that when the lcader chain Lrive sprocket 143 for the outer chambers is free to rotate the magnet 271 is adjacent to a proximity switch 272 to provide an oxter charbcr drive indication.In similar fashion when the slide 186 is caused to move so that the loader chain drive sprocket 167 or the inncr chambers 1 frce to rotate the magnet 269 is adjacent to a proximity switch 273 which provides an indication of inner chamber drive. Figure 14 also shows a loader cha in p,lot valve 274 which is in communication with the pressure and tank lines through the valve block 2G6. The valve block also contains a control valve 276 containing a piston 277 which is spring loaded to a neutral position as shown. Uith the pilot valve 274 in the position as shown in Figure 14 both ends of the piston in the control valve are communicated tlith the tank line and the control valve remains neutrally located. With the pilot valve 274 solenoid actuated in the direction of arrow 278 pressure is applied to the con tro,1 valve 276 to drive the piston 277 to a position causing pressure to be routed through the control valve to the left end of the hydraulic cylinder 43 as seen in Figure 14.Consequently a piston 279 disposed within the cylinder contained in the drive 43 is driven to the position shown.A rack 280 on the piston 279 is meshed with the pinion gear 163 driving the pinion rotationally and retracting either the loader chain 146 or 152 depending upon whether the inner or the outer loader chain is elected to be driven by the pilot valve 264 as described hereinbefore. A magnet 281 is attached to the structure rotated by the pinion gear 163. The magnet is moved into a position adjacent to a proximity switch 282 which provides a signal indicative of retracted loader chains. en the pilot valve 274 is actuated in a direction indicated by the arrow 283 in Figure 14 pressure is com, municated with the left end of the piston 277 in the control valve 276. The piston is noved so that pressure is communicated through the control valvc to the right end of the cylinder in the hydraulic drive 43 to drive the piston 279 and the rack 280 thereon to the left as seen in Figure 14. The pinion gear 163 is rotated hy the rack to extend whichever loader chain is unlocked by the actuation of the pilot valve 264.The magnet 281 is thereby moved until it is adjacent to a proximity switch 284 which provides a signal indicative of an extended loader chain. The usual appropriate relief valves. and deceleration ports for the piston 279 as it approaches the end of the cylinder are showy in the hydraulic drive cylinder 43. Turning now to Figure 15 a hydraulic schematic is shown for driving and latching the cradle arm 48 between a position at which the projectile transfer tray 46 is in alignment with one of the chambers 59 in the storage drum 36 and a position with the tray in alignment with the loading axis through the breech 28. The hydraulic drive asser.bly 52 for the cradle arm 48 is shown containing a cylinder in which is disposed a piston 286 which moves longitudinally in the cylinder. A rack 287 is formed on the piston which is meshed with a pinion gear 288 fixed on the Output shaft 212. The cradle arm drive gear 211 is meshed with the sector gear 213 and is fixed to the other end of the output shaft 212. A prcssure line P and a return line T to the hydraulic tank are shown coupled to the cradle arm drive 52.A cradle arm position pilot valve 292 is shown in a neutral position wherein the tan line T is coupled o both encs of piston 293 which is spring urged to a eutral position within a control valve 294. I hcn the pi lo valve 292 is solenoid actuated in the direction of the arrow 296 pressure is directed aqainst the piston 293 which moves the piston to route pressure through the control valve 294 to the right end of the piston 286. The piston is therefor urqed into the position shown in Figure 15 and the drive gear 211 drives the cradle arm 48 to 0 elevation.This is the cradle arm position from which the transfer trays are rotated into one of the receiving positions to receive ammunition components from the storage drums. With the pilot valve 292 solenoid actuated in the direction of the arrow 297 pressure is directed against the piston 293 in the control valve which sets the valve to communicate pressure with the left end of the piston 286. Piston 286 is thereby driven to the right within the drive assembly 52. The rack motion past the engaged pinion 288 is such as to turn the drive gear 211 in a direction to cause the cradle arm to move clockwise as seen in Figure 15 and thereby lower the cradle arm. As best seen in Figure 16 a piston 298 is contained within the damping and position detection cylinder 54. The piston rod 216, as hereinbefore described, is attached to the trunnion arm 214 on the gun tube trunnion 56 and extends through the end wall of the cylinder 54. The cylinder is The connected to,, hydraulic reservoir through line T and piston position within the cylinder as shown in Figure 16 is realized only when the cradle arm 48 is aligned with the gun tube 27. A magnet 299 is carried on the piston so that when the cradle arm is in alignment with the gun tube the magnet is adjacent to a proximity switch 301 which provides an indication of such alignment.The cylinder 54 is seen to have a pattern of apertures 302 at the end approached by the piston when the cradle arm 48 is approaching alignment with the gun tube so that the cross section of the oil flow path is gradually decreased to thereby gradually decelerate the cradle erm. A check valve 303 is also provided so that movement of the piston 298 within the cylinder away from the end mounting the proximity switch increasing the angle of the cradle arm meets a lesser resistance fron the hydraulic flow then movement of the piston in the opposite direction. A zero elevation latch 304 is seen in Figure 15 which operates to latch the cradle arm in position when it is oriented so that the transfer tray 46 may be rotated about axis 192 to the receiving, or projectile pickup, positions. The zero elevation late contains a cylinder in which a piston 306 is disposed which is spring loaded to extend an arm 307 from the latch. The arm, when extended, pivotally places a latch member 308 in position to contact a detent 309 in the cradle arm 48 to thereby prevent the cradle arm from being lowered from the 0 elevation position.The piston 306 carries a magnet 311 which is disposed adjacent to a proximity switch 312 when the cradle arm is latched thereby providing an indication that the zero elevation latch is set. A Pilot valve 313 is solenoid actuated in the direction of the arrow 314 to route pressure from a pressure line P to the left side of the piston 306 Figure 15 thereby driving the piston to the right, releasing the latch and changing the state of the output from the proximity switch 312. As soon as the solenoid actuating pilot valve is de energized the left side of the piston 306 is communicated with the tank line T and the spring bearing against the piston returns it to the latch position. A gun tube elevation latch 316 is also shown inFigure 15. The gun tube elevation latch 316 is carried on the cradle structure so that it moves in elevation with the gun tube and the breech. The latch 316 has a cylinder there in containing 2 piton 317 which is spring loaded toward a retracted position at the lower end of the cylinder as shown. An arm 318 extends through the end wall of the latch.A latching member 319, which is spring loaded in a clockwise direction by some cans such as a torsion spring not shown , is attached to the end of the arm 318 at a pivot 320. As the cradle arm 48 is lowered and as it passes by the upper curved surface of the latching member it depresses or rotates the latching member 319 against the torsion sprints. Aftcr the cradle arm has passed the latching member, the latching member springs into the position as shown inFigure 15 contacting the upper side of the cradle arm and locking it in place at the gun tube elevation. A solenoid actuated pilot valve 321 is shown inFigure 15 with latch 31G in the latched position. hen the pilot valve is actuated in the direction or the arrow 322 pressure is communicated with the lower sic of the piston 317 forcing the arm 318 to extend thereby rotating the latch member 319 in a clockwise direction as shown and releasing the cradle arm 48 for travel back to the 0 elevation position. when the pilot valve is de encrgited it rcturns to the position as shown in Figure 15 communisating the lower cnc of the piston with the tank lineT.A magnet 323 is carried on the piston 317 and is in 2 position which is adjacent to a proximity switch 324 when the piston is in the latches position. Thus, the proximity switch 324 provides a signal indicative of the state of the gun tube elevation latch latched or unlatched. The hydraulic drive assembly 51 for the projectile transfer tray 46 is shown in Figure 17 including the cylinder 202 and the pinion gear 201 attached to the shaft 194 which drives the transfer tray rotationally about the rotation axis 192 as seen in Figures 8 and 17. The hydrau lic schematic for the transfer drive which positions the transfer tray in the receiving and loading positions shown in Figure S is best described with reference to Figure 17.A piston 332 is disposed for axial novement within the cylinder 202 and carries a rack 335 intermediate the ends thereof. The cylinder has a fixed stop 333 at one end thereof and a movable stop 334 at the other end. The cylinder also includes appropriate deceleration slots 336 at each end of the cylinder to slow the piston 332 as it approaches either end of the cylinder. Check valves 337 are also provided at each end of the cylinder so that unatten ,sated pressure may be readily applied to the ends of the piston to rapidly move it away from the stops 333 or 334. For reference purposes, the position of the pivot axis 192 through the tray 46 as it is shown in Figure 17 is taken to lie in the planc which includes the loaaing axis through thc.center of the brace 28. A tray position pilot valve 326 is provided which is coupled to a valve block 327 through appropriate hydraulic lines. A pressure line P and a return line T coupled to a hydraulic reservoir are connected to the val, . block. The valve block 327 contains a control valve 328 having a piston 329 therein which is sprinq loaded to a centered or neutral position as shown.The tray lock cylinder 203 is shown as being defincd within the valve block 327. A piston 331 is disposed for axial movement within thc cylinder 203.The piston has an extension which passes through a eal in the wall of the valve block and which carries the transfer tray position latch 204 on the end thereof. Khen the pilot valve 326 is solenoid actuated in the direction of the arrow 338 pressure is applied to the upper end of the control valve 328 Figure 17 thereby forcing the piston 329 in a downward direction. Pressure is thereby routed through the control valve to the loc cylinder 203 and is applied against a shoulder 339 on the piston 331.The piston is raised in the cylinder disengaging the latch 2C from the tray position detent member 199. Pressure is also routed at this time to the lower end of the cylinder 202. The piston 332 is thereby forced against the stop 333 in the cylinder 202 and the rack 335 engages the pinion gear 201 to drive the tray 46 to the position shown inFigure 17. When the tray position pilot valve 326 is solenoid actuated in the direction shown by arrow 341 pressure is applied to the lower end of the control valve 328 forcing the piston 329 upwardly.Pressure is therefore communicated through the control valve to a shoulder 342 on the piston 331 in the tray lock cylinder and the piston 331 is raised to disengage the latch member 204 fron the shoulder 209 on the detent member 199. Pressure is thereby cormunicated through the lock cylinder 203 to the upper end of the cylinder 2O2 driving the piston 32 off of the top 333. The rack 335 on the .ston drives the pinion gear 201 in a clockwise direction as seen in Figure 17 to cause the tray 46 to assume one of the inner or outer sleeve receiving positions.If the otcr receiving position is selected the stop 334 is positioned as seen in Figure 17 and the rotation of the shaft 194 will be stopped with the notch 206 in the detent member 199 lying below the latch member 204. When the actuation siynal is subsequently removed from the pilot valve 326 it rcturns to the neutral position shown and pressure is relieved in the lock cylinder 203. The lock member 204 falls into the notch 206 thereby locking the tray at the position for receiving projectiles from the outer ring of sleeves 59.If the stop 334 is positioned to select the receiving position aligned with the inner rim of sleeves in the storage drum it is with drawn slightly in the cylinder 232 and the shaft 194 will rotate to a position such that the shoulder 207 on the detent me..lbcr is contacted by the latch member 204 when pressure in the lock cylinder 203 is renoved. The tray is thus locked in a position to receive projectiles ron the inner ring of sleeves 59. A magnet 330 is mounted on the lock cylinder piston 331 and when the latch member 204 is lowered to be in cngagement with the detent member 199 the magnet is aligned with a proximity switch 340 mounted on the lock cylinder 203.The switch output therefore provides an indication as to whether the transfer tray 46 is in either the latched or the unlatched condition. A tray receiving position pilot valve 343 is seen in Figure 17 in a neutral position as shown. When it is desired to drive the transfer tray 46 to the receiving position aligned with a storage drum sleeve 59 in the inner ring of sleeves, the pilot valve 343 is solenoid actuated in the direction indicatcd by arrow 344. The pressure line P and the return line T are coupled to the pilot valve. With actuation in the direction of arrow 344 pressure is routed through the pilot valve to the upper end of a stop adjustment cylinder 346 and is thereby exerted against the upper side of a stop drive piston 347 contained within the cylinder. he piston has an arm 348 attached thereto which extends through a sealed opening in the cylinder 346. The arran is connected to the adjustable stop 334.With the aforementioned actuation arrow 344 the stop is extended axially in the cylinder 202 through a distance equivalent to the stroke of the piston 347. The piston 332 may now travel within the cylinder 202 through a greater axial distance thereby turning the pinion gear 201 and shaft 194 through a greater angle.The tray 46 may therefore be moved to the receiving position aligned with the inner ring of chambers As is clcar from Figure 17 solenoid actuation of the tray receiving position pilot valve 343 in the direction of the arrow 349 directs pressure to the cylinder 346 having a senne which urges the piston 347 into the position shown in the Figure so that the transfer tray nay only be driven to a position of alignment with the outer ring of chambers in the storage drum. The hydraulic drive syStCr.l for the rammer pawl 227 in the transfer tray 46 is shown schematically in Figure 18. The hydraulic slip joint 193 is shotin rotatable upon a center shaft 352 attached to the cradle arrow 48. The slip joint transfers hydraulic pressure P and hydraulic return T between the cradle arrow anC the tray as shown diagrammatically and in a fashion which is well known to those of skill in this art. The hydraulic linus are coupled to a rammer pawl pilot valve 353 and to a control valv block 354. The hydraulic pressure and return lines are coupled through the control valve block to the ranker chain hydraulic drive cylinder 58.The cylinder contains a piston 356 disposed for axial movement therein and having a rack 357 formed on one side there of. The rack is meshed with a pinion 358 which is fixed on the output shaft 218. Axial motion of the, piston within the cylinder 58 therefore provides rotation of the rammer chain drive sprocket 219 as described hercin before. The piston 356 has a detent 359 fored therein near one end rigure 18 . A ranmer chain lock cylinder 36 is attached to the side of the drive cylinder 58 holding an axially movable piston 362 therein. The piston is spring loaded in a direction which causes a latch projection 363 to extend through a seal in the end of the pisten. The latch projection is formed to enter the cue tent 359 when the piston 356 is in the position shown in Figure 18 to thereby lock the rammer chain drive in a position with the rammer pawl rctracted. A magnet 364 is mounted on the piston 362. A proximity switch 36 is mounted in the wall of the cylinder 361 in a position adjacent to the magnet when the piston is positioned so that the latch projection 363 is extended from the piston. In this fashion, the switch state indicates whether the piston in the drive cylinder 58 is in a latched or an unlatched position. when the rammer pawl pilot valve 353 is solenoid actuated in the direction of the arrow 367, pressure is communicated through the pilot valve to the cylinder 361 and is exerted against a shoulder 368 on the piston 362.The piston is therefore raised within the lock cylinder 361 and the latch projection 363 is removed from the detent 359 in the piston 356. A return line T attached to the lock cylinder is blanked off by the piston 362 and a pressure line P is communicated through the lock cylinder with the left end of the control valve block 354 Fiqure 18 .Pressure is therefore exerted against tha left end of a piston 369 in the control valve, which is normally spring loaded to a neutral position as shown. Pressure is consequently routed through the control valve to the right end of the cylinder 58 to thereby drive the unlocked piston 356 against the stop on the left end of the rammer chain drive cylinder.The linear motion of the rack 357 causes the pinion 358 and the shaft 218 to rotate in a counterclockwise direction, as seen in Figure 18, and the rammer chain 57 is driven to move the rammer pawl 227 toward the discharge end of the transfer tray 46. The rammer chain is driven at a high enough speed so that a projectile 64 in the tray reaches a speed such that projectile inertia will carry the projectile into the forcing cone within the barrel 26 after the rammer pawl motion is arrested. A magnet 371 is mounted on the end of the piston 356 and is positioned adjacent to a proximity switch 372 when the rack is moved to the left in Figure 18 and the raiser pawl 227 is in the extended position near left end of the transfer tray 46.The proximity switch 372 therefore provides an indication of the rarraner chain extension. When the rammer pawl pilot valve 353 is allowed to return to a neutral position, as shown in Figure 18, pressure is relieved from the shoulder 368 on the lock cylinder piston and the piston is returned by a coil spring 373 to extend the latch projection 363 to contact the piston 356. When the pilot valve is solenoid actuated in the direction indicated by the arrow 374 pressure is coupled through the pilot valve to the right end of the piston 369 in the control valve block 354. The piston is Lioed to the left as sern in Figure 18 and pressure is coupled to the left end of the rammer chain drive cylinder 58.Thc piston 356 is therefore driven to the right end of the cylinder and the rammer chain 57 moves to retract the rammer pawl 227 to the position shown in the Figure as the drive sprocket 219 is rotated in a clockwise direction.Another magnet 376 is mounted on the right end of the rammer chain drive piston, and when the drive piston is positioned adjacent to a proximity switch 377 the switch provides an output inuicatiny tiLe rammer pawl is in the retracted position. The latch projection 363 is forced into the detent 353 on the cylinder when the cylinder reaches the position shown in Figure 18. The cylinder 58 is shown having deceleration apertures and check valves as shown llercinbeforc in conjunction with the description of the tray drive cylinder 202 in Figure 17. In a preferred embodiment of the automated loauer, the operating sequence for the component parts of the system is controlled by a microprocessor 378, as suen inFigure 19. The microprocessor includes the us al random access rut and read only ROM mcmorics and a central processinq unit CPt . Address and data information is passed through an input output section 379 to the major subsystems within the loading system herin described.There are five major subsystems for the handling of projectiles and five major counterpart subsystems for the handling of the propellant charges. These subsystems, as illustrated in Figure 19, comprise the storage drum subsystems, the loader chain subsystems, the cradle arm subsystems, the rammer chain subsystems and the transfer tray subsystems. The construction of the breech which provides opening and closing is well known, and since it is not considered to be a part of the instant invention, it is not described in detail herein. The breech block is partially closed after the propellant charge is rammed to retain the charge. The breech block is fully closed immediately after the rammer chain has fully retracted and the proximity switch 377 is actuated as described in the discussion of Figure 18 hereinbefore. As soon as the charge is fired the bre ech block is opened.The operation of the breech block both in closing and opening is automatically controlled and hydraulically powered. The initiation of the block opening is accomplished in this embodiment by valving which is actuated at the initiation of counter recoil. A typical operational sequence is hereinafter recited. It should be realized that some of the sequential operations may be performed simultancously and are commanded by the microprocessor in accordance with an appropriate proqram entered into the read only memory. The microprocessor rapidly and continuously interrogates the various condition indicative proximity switches described hereinhefore and uses the condition indications to provide the proper operation sequencing.Initially, it will be assumed that both storage drums contain ammunition components, both transfer trays are loaded, one with a projectile and the other with a propellant charge, the cradle arms are aligned in elevation with the gun tube 27, the trays are raised into a position such that they are on an arc which passes through one of the receiving positions for the inner or the outer sleeves in the storage drums, the rar mer pawls in the transfer trays, are both retracted ano the loader chain pawls in both storage drums are retracted. 1.

Return to step three hereinbefore and continually repeat the sequence to deliver a series of projectiles and propellant charges in proper sequence to the breech. A reload modc is selectable in the system which deactivates all of the system exccpt the index drives for the projectile and propellant charge drums and the drum locks. A storage drum position is selected and ammunition is placed in the sleeves in the drum which are indexed to be aligned with the receiving positions for the transfer trays. The rounds are placed into the sleeves through the fronts of the drums. The loading position information is entered into random access memory so that the memory retains the data relating to specific round locations ani types. An alternative method of loading the drums would involve relocating the rear supporting bearing between inner and outer rows of sleeves to make the rear of both the inner and outer rows of sleeves accessahle. The rounds could then he placed in the sleeves through the backs of the drums. Although the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention has been herein shown and described, it will be apparent that modification and variation may be made without departing from what is regarded to be the subject matter of the invention.
