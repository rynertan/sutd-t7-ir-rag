## Abstract
A stable, uniform coke oil dispersion is prepared by grinding 15 to 55 by weight of coke particles in the absence of free oxygen in a medium consisting essentially of gas oil and or a heavier petroleum fraction. Grinding is continued until the size of the majority of the particles is reduced to a value in the range 1 to 10 micron. Preferably the coke is uni formly dispersed in the gas oil and or heavier petroleum frac tion prior to grinding.

## Description
FUEL COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR ITS PREPARATION This invention relates to the production of dispersions of coke and oil. Coal oil slurries have previously been disclosed, see for example,British Patent Specification 975687. Whilst these behave as nearNewtonian non settling fluids in pipelines, they separate on standing.Thus such slurries are suitable for use immediately after preparation or pipelining but are not suitable for transportation by tanker nor for storage. British Patent Specification 396432 discloses the preparation of coal oil mixtures in which coal is preground before being contacted with oil. The coal is not ground in the presence of the oil. After mixing, the blend of coal and oil is passed through a homogeniser which disperses the coal particles uniformly in the oil but does not reduce their size. Our British Patent Specification 1523193 discloses a method for the preparation of a uniform coal oil dispersion which method comprises grinding coal in a medium consisting essentially of gas oil and or a heavier petroleum fraction until the particle size is reduced to a value below 10 micron and the dispersion contains 15 to 55 by weight coal, expressed as a percentage by weight of the total dispersion and until a stable dispersion results on ceasing grinding. By stable dispersion is meant a dispersion which does not separate into layers of its constituent compounds on standing at ambient temperature for at least six months. Coal, however, is a complex organic mineral of high molecular weight. Coke, although one form is derived from coal, has different properties in many respects, e.g. molecular weight, hydrogen content and the nature of its surface. We have now discovered stable coke oil dispersions which are suitable for pumping and storage and a method for their preparation. Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a uniformly dispersed, stable fuel dispersion containing 15 to 55 by weight, preferably 30 to 40 by weight, of coke particles, the size of the majority of the particles being in the range 1 to 10 micron, in a medium consisting essentially of a gas oil and or a heavier petroleum fraction, the percentage being expressed as a percentage by weight of the total weight of the dispersion. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for the preparation of a stable, uniform coksoil dispersion which method comprises grinding 15 to 55 , preferably 30 to 40 , by weight of coke particles in the absence of free oxygen in a medium consisting essentially of gas oil and or a heavier petroleum fraction until the size of the majority of the particles is reduced to a value in the range 1 to 10 micron, the percentage being expressed as a percentage by weight of the total weight of the dispersion. An important feature of the invention is the stability of the coke oildispersions produced. The stability is a function of three variables the method of grinding in the presence of the oil, the final particle size and the final concentration of coke in oil. If all three are chosen correctly, then the resulting dispersion is in the form of a gel which is a physical network formed by the coke particles in the oil. It is a uniform structure in which the coke particles cannot settle out, because they form part of it. This is unlike all previous coal oil dispersions which have been either slurries in which the coal particles are suspended in the oil from which they will eventually settle out or dispersions in which the coal particles are of colloidal size maintained in suspension by the Brownian movement. If the coke is not ground in the oil, the gel will not form. If the coke particle size is too great, the gel will not form and the particles will settle out. The concentration of the coke particles is also critical. If it is too high or too low, the gel will not form. Grinding can be carried out in vibratory, agitatory or tumbling ball mills. It is necessary to exclude free oxygen, e.g. air, during the grinding operation. This can be easily achieved in the case of vibratory and agitatory ball mills by filling the mill completely. In the case of a tumbling ball mill, it is not practical to fill the mill completely and the milling should be carried out under an inert gaseous atmosphere, e.g. a blanket of nitrogen. When using a ball mill, it is, of course, desirable to use balls made of a material which does not react with the solid and which does not wear unduly itself or the interior surface of the mill during the grinding.Ball mills usually contain steel or glass balls and these are suitable for the present purpose. The term coke includes coke derived from either petroleum or coal. Preferably the coke supplied to the grinding process is a coke of particle size not less than 250 micron. Preferably the coke supplied is uniformly dispersed in the gas oil and or heavier petroleum fraction prior to grinding The grinding time will usually not exceed 12 minutes for an agitatory ball mill, depending on the size of the balls in the mill.As the size of the balls increases so does the grinding time. If a coke concentration of greater than 55 by weight is exceeded then the resulting dispersion may be too solid like for pumping. Preferably the oil is a fuel oil, most preferably a fuel oil having a viscosity of not more than 3500 seconds, Redwood No. 1 at 1000F 37.80C . The required viscosity may be achieved by cutting back , if necessary. Such coke fuel oil dispersions are suitable for use in blast furnaces, cement kilns, industrial boilers, marine boilers and utility boilers. Diesel oil may be used and the dispersions used as a fuel for low speed diesel engines. In this case the coke particles should be sufficiently small not to increase abrasion. In the case of certian heavier fuel oil fractions it may be necessary to heat them in order to render them sufficiently mobile for use as a r grinding liquid. The invention is illustrated with reference to the followingExample. Example The fuel oil was a mixed source fuel oil with a viscosity of 950 sec. Redwood 1 at 1000F 37.80C . It had the following properties Pour point C 9 Total sulphur content wt 3.29 Water content wt 0.031 Relative density at 15.50C 15.50C 0.963 Kinematic viscosity at 500C cSt 122.6 Kinematic viscosity at 82.20C cSt 30.6 Kinematic viscosity at 1000C cSt 17.5 The coke was a green petroleum coke calcined at 12000C in a rotary calciner. The coke had the following properties Carbon content wt 95.2 Hydrogen content wt 0.32 Sulphur content wt 1.37 Water content wt 0.4 Ash content wt 1.1 The coke had been preground in a hammer mill to 99.9 wt less than 212 micron before grinding in the fuel oil.The fuel oil 1.95 kg was warmed to 400C and the ground petroleum coke 1.05 kg added. The coke was dispersed using a high speed vortex mixer until a homogeneous mixture had been obtained. The mixture was then pumped to a stirred ball mill sold under the trade name of Dyno Mill Type KDL by Willy BachofenMaschinefabrik, Basle, Switzerland at a rate of 100 ml min. The grinding chamber, a horizontally mounted cylinder of volume 600 ml,contained 1 mm steel balls 500 ml . The balls were stirred by agitator discs mounted on a horizontal shaft which ran parallel with the axis of the cylinder. The shaft speed was set at 4500 rpm giving a disc peripheral speed of 15 m sec. The product was collected and passed back through the mill at the same flow rate. This procedure was repeated once more giving a total of three passes through the mill with a residence time in the grinding chamber of 9 minutes. The resulting dispersion was a thick, black, lustrous fluid with a mean coke particle size of 3.8 micron. After storage at ambient temperature for 6 months the dispersion showed no signs of settling. After standing for 24 hours at 1000C the dispersion was also quite stable.
