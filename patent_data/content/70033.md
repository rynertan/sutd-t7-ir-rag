# Quantitative determination of adenosine.

## Abstract
A method of quantitative determination of adenosine by means of competitive immunoassay based on a competitive antigen antibody reaction. In the competitive antigen antibody reaction, an antibody is used which is obtained from an animal which has been immunized by introduction thereto of an antigen which comprises a carrier protein bonded with 2 and 3 hydroxyls of the adenosine through dicarboxylic acid residues, and a labelled adenosine and 2 ,3 diacyladenosine which has been produced by acylation of adenosine in the sample to be assayed or in a standard solution are caused to undergo competitive reaction for the antibody whereby it has been made possible to determine adenosine quantitatively in high sensitivity and in high accuracy.
