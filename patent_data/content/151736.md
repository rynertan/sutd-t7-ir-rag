# High density information records made of conductive resin compositions comprising inorganic powder stabilizers.

## Abstract
High density information records made of vinyl chloride resin compositions which comprise conductive powder and inorganic compounds in the form of powder having the antacidic action and a predetermined average size are described. By this, dropout defects in the information record can be suppressed to a significant extent. The inorganic compounds are compounds of metals of Groups II and III of the Periodic Table.
