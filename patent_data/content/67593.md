## Description
DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF TRIMETHOPRIM AND NOVEL INTERMEDIATES FQR USE THEREIN The present invention provides a novel process for the preparation of trimethoprim, i.e. 5 3,4,5 trimethoxyphenyl methyl3 2, 4 pyrimidinediarnine of the formula EMI1.1 Trimethoprim is a well known antimicrobic agent and a sulphonamide synergist. Many processes are known for the preparation of trimethoprim. The following process is described inBritish Specification No.957797 EMI1.2 where Ar 3,4,5 trimethoxyphenyl and R alkyl. There are many later modifications of this process. For example British Specification No. 1261455 describes the reaction of an N substituted p amino a benzyl propionitrile of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein Ar is for example 3,4,5 trimethoxyphenyl and the NR5R6 group is an aliphatic, heterocyclic or aromatic amino group, with guanidine to produce trimethoprim. The nitriles of formula a are themselves made by the reactionEMI2.2 tb Ar CHo SEP SEP NCCH2CH2NR5R6 SEP A tb where AR and NR5R6 are as hereinbefore defined.This reaction is effected in the presence of a polar solvent and a base. The present invention provides a novel, simple process for the preparation of trimethoprim in good yields. According to the invention, 2 moles 3,4,5trimethoxybenzaldehyde are condensed with 3,3 phenylenedi imino dipropanenitrile of the formulaEMI2.3 in the presence of a base, to produce a new intermediate, namely a phenylenedi imino N,N 3,4,5 trimethoxy benzyl acrylonitrilej of the formula EMI2.4 Db .is intermediate of formula III then reacts with 2 moles of guanidine to produce trimethoprim. The imino groups of the compounds II and III ren be in o , m or p position in relation to each other. The intermediate of formula II surprisingly reacts with 3,4,5 trimethoxybenzaldehyde to give the benzyl intermediate of formula III in good yield.Because of steric hindrance in the intermediate III , it could be assumed that no reaction at all would take place.In the mentioned condensation reaction the benzyl compound of the formula III is formed almost entirely, which is advantageous when the intermediate reacts with guanidine.The benzal form, i.e.EMI3.1 wherein Ar 3,4, 5 trimethoxyphenyl, practically does not appear at all. The condensation of trimethoxybenzaldehyde with the 3,3 phenylenedi imino dipropanenitrile of formula II is carried out in a polar solvent, preferably dimethylsulphoxide, tert. butanol, dimethylformamide,N methylpyrrolidone, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, isopropanol or a mixture thereof. Suitable alkaline condensing agents are, e.g., potassium t butoxide, sodium isopropoxide or sodium methoxide and the temperature of reaction is usually 10 300 C, preferably 15 200 C. The condensation product obtained may be purified in a very simple manner for instance by evaporating the solvent and adding the residue dropwise to water, which gives the intermediate of formula III in crystalline form of high quality. Trimethoprim may be produced from the intermediate of formula III by reaction with guanidine by refluxing in a suitable solvent, preferably a lower alkanol. The new process gives a high overall yield of trimethoprim especially when o phenylenediamine derivatives are used. The dipropanenitriles of formula it , which are also novel intermediates, may be made by reaction of acrylonitrile with a phenylenediamine of formula EMI4.1 in the presence of an acid catalyst. The reaction is conveniently effected at an elevated temperature, e.g. 50 1000C., in an aqueous medium in the presence of a catalytic amount of an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid and a polymerization inhibitor, e.g.hydroquinone, to stabilize the acrylonitrile. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples. Example 1 To a reaction flask containing Erphenylene diamine 65.0 g, 0.6 mol and 0.7 g hydroquinone, were added 250 ml water followed by acrylonitrile 75 g, 1.42 mol and, dropwise, 3 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The temperature was raised to 800C where it was kept for 1.5 hours. The product was precipitated by cooling, filtered off and washed with water. After recrystallization from 200 ml water ethanol 1 1 123.3 g 96 of the theoretical of 3 3 p pbenylenedi imino dipropanenitrile was obtained, m.p. 133 1360C. Example 2 By repeating the process of Example 1 but replacing the p phenylenediamine with o phenylenediamine, 118.0 g 92 of the theoretical of 3,31 o phenylenedi imino dipropanenitrile were obtained, m.p. 115 1160C. Example 3 By repeating the process of Example 1 but replacing the E phenylenediamine with m phenyl enediamine, 119.5 g 9 3 0 of the theoretical of 3,3 m phenylenediimino dipropanenitrile were obtained, m.p. 167 1700C. Example 4 3,4,5 Trimethoxybenzaldehyde 4.9 g, 0.025 mol and 3,3 o phenylenedi imino dipropanenitrile prepared as described in Example 2 2.7 g, 0.0126 mol were dissolved in a mixture of dimethyl sulphoxide 15 ml and tert. butanol 20 ml . The solution was cooled to 150C and potassium t butoxide 2.8 g, 0.025 mol was added with stirring in small portions at 15 200C. The stirring was continued overnight. The t butanol was evaporated, and the residue added dropwise to cold water 150 ml .The light yellow condensation product was separated by filtering, washed with water and dried.

Example 6 3,4,5 Trimethoxybenzaldehyde and 3,3 mphenylenedi imino dipropanenitrile prepared as described in Example 3 were condensed together as described inExample 4 and m phenylenedi imino N,N La 3,4,5 trimetboxybenzyl acrylonitrile was obtained in a 73 yield as a dark brown reaction product, m.p. 76 790C. Example 7 The condensation product from Example 4 5.7 g, 0.01 mol and an alcoholic solution of guanidine prepared by dissolving 5.7 g, 0.06 mol, of guanidine hydrochloride in 25 ml ethanol and adding 11 ml of 30 0 methanolic solution of sodium methoxide and filtering off the precipitated sodium chloride were refluxed with stirring for 4 hours. The solution was allowed to cool and the 5 3,4,5 trimethoxyphenyl methyl 2,4 pyrimidinediamine which had crystallized out was separated by filtration, and washed with water and cold acetone. The yield was 4.8 g 83 of the theoretical . Melting point 199 2010C.
