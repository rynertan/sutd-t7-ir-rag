## Description
POLYURETHANE SPRAY COMPOSITION CONTAINING LACTONE VISCOSITY MODIFIER This invention relates to a method of king a poly ureth2ne, composition useful in such method, and a polyurethane produced by such method. Polyurethanes generally comprise as essential components a polyol such as a higher molecular weight glycol, a polyisocyanate such as a diisocyanate, and a curative or chain extender such as a relatively low molecular weight polyamine or polyol. There are numerous applications for polyurethanes which are prepared by spray methods especially when it is desired to apply a coating of polyurethane onto z surface. The two main spray methods are 1 One shoX system and, 2 Prepolymer system. In the one shot system usually two low viscosity streams of materials are employed, namely a Polyisocyanate and, b Mixture of polyol and curative. The one shot system suffers certain deficiencies especially th sensitivity of the polyisocyanate to moisture, Under humid conditions, even at 2 relatively short period of exposure to moisture in the air the highly concentrated and reactive polyisocyanate tends to combine with the water present leading to extensive foaming in the resultant polyurethane. The advantages include working with low viscosity liquid materials and the general solubility of curatives in the polyols. The prepolymer system 2 essentially employs two ingredient feed streams, namely i Polyurethane prepolymer and, ii Curative s wherein i is a reaction product of polywsocyanate and a suitable polyol having residual isocyanate functionality, and ii is a polyamine or polyol essentially used for providing the desired amount of chain extension and or crosslinking. The disadvantage of this system ltes in the rather high viscosity of such prepolymers i and the oftentimes solid nature of the curative. It has been the practice to add certain inert volatile organic solvents in order to reduce the viscosity of i and place ii into solution. The prepoly er system leads to a product having physical properties superior to those of the one shot system because in the latter the polyol and curatives compete with each other in the reaction with polyisocyanate, yet, the solvents added about 30 to 70 by volume such as toluene, rethyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, xylene etc., create hazards to human health because of toxicity or chances of explosion and fires. In addition, these solvents may be lost less costly ventilation and recovery systems are inslall ed, This invention relates to the use of a viscosity modifier which when added to a urethane prepolymer system, sufficiently decreases viscosity and readily dissolves or solvates useful polyurethane curatives so that the two components prepolymer and curative can be readily metered, mixed, and sprayed using conventional commercial spray equipment. rrrne viscosity modifier employed in the invention is a lactone which essetially is not volatile and hence the system is free of volatile solverits. The invention accordingly pertains to the use of a lactone as a non volatile modifier to dissolve solid components and to reduce viscosity of urethane prepolymer systems such that they are sprayable on conventional equipment. A prior commercially available curative for poly urethane prepolymer is a mixture of MCCA 4,4 ethylene bis o chloroaniline and gamma butyrolactone but such material is unsuitable for use in the present nvention because it cures too slow , aside from the fact that MOCA is a suspected carcinogen. Prepolymers useful in this invention are conventional materials made by reacting a polyurethane form ing polyol frecuently a high molecular weight glycol with an excess of a polyurethane forming polylsocyanate, preferably an aromatic polyisocyanate, usually a ciso cyanate such as tolyene diisocyanate TDI or 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI or their polymeric forms. As in conventional practice the tolylene diiso cyanate can be 100 2, isomer or a mixture of isomers e.g., 80 20 or 65 35 mixtures of 2,4 2,6 isomers . The polyols used to make polyurethanes are frequently poly alkylene ether glycols, also called sometimes polyether glycols, polyester glycols3 mixed poly ether ester glycols, polyether triols, polycaprolactone glycols, and the like, of which the following may be mentioned by way of non limiting illustrative examples polytetra methylene ether glycol of 650 2000 molecular weight MW polypropylene ether glycol of 400 300 MW polyceprolactone glycol of 500 2000 MW polyethylene adipate glycol of 500 3000 M W polyethylene propylene adipate glycol of 500 3000 MW polyethylene butylene adipate glycol of 500 3000 MW polybutylene adipate glycol of 500 3000 MW and poly ethylene oxide terminated poly propylene ether glycol of 500 3000 MW,Reactive isocyanate contents of the prepolymers ordinarily range from 3 to 12 by weight . Poly alkylene ether glycols and polyester glycols are referred. Aside from the prepolymer, the other polyurethane forming component of the present composition is a curative for the polyurethane. The curative is ordinarily one or more substances containing a plurality of active hydrogen sites, ordinarily two active hydrogens. Most frequently the curative is 2 polyamine or polyol, especially a diamine and or diol. Suitable polyol curatives include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol, 41,6 hexanediol, thiodiethanol and others, whereas representative polyamine curatives are methylene dianiline MDA , trimethylene glycol di p aminobenzoate, bis o aminophenylthio ethane, 4,4 methylenebis dimethy anthranilate , ethylenediamine hexamethylene diamine or mixtures of polyols or polyamines or of a polyol and polyamine. The choice of the polyol, polyamine and mixtures thereof depends on the tack free time desired for te resultant polyurethane. Usually a tack free tie of from 15 seconds to 5 minutes is desirable, preferably from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. The choice of curative or mixtures of curatives depends also on the diisocyanate cn which the prepolymer s based. n case of MDI the curative ray be a mixture of relatively high polyol content and a les amount of solyamine. On the other hand when curing DI based preolymers polyamine type curatives are prefe although mixtures of polyamine and polyol are applicable, Whatever the choice of curative or mixture of curatives, it is critical to achieve a tack free tlme within the time limits indicated above. As already mentioned, the addition of a lactone in accordance with this invention greatly reduces the viscosity of such a curative or mixtures of curative enchancing their sprayability, but suc lactones ray also be employed to considerably reduce the viscosity of the prepolymers thus making it possible to reduce prepolymer spray temperature and or possible to use prepolymers having molecular weight and therefore higher viscosi√ßies higher than It was possi ble to use heretofore.The latter application of lactones is especially desirable because the higher the molecular weight of the prepolymer the lower the amount of curative required. The final physical properties of the resultant polyurethane may also be improved by increasing the prepolymer molecular weight. Specifically excluded as a curative is 4,4 methylenebis o chloroaniline because of its suspected carcinogenicity and slow cure rate. The lactone viscosity modifier employed in the invention has the general formulaEMI7.1 wherein R represents an alkylene radical having fron. 4 to 6 carbon atoms. The alkylene radical ray be linear, or it may be branched. The lactone ordinarily has a melting point of from minus 50 to plus 10 C, preferably from minus 45 to CeC, The lactone ordinarily has p boiling point of from 150 to 2500 C, frequently from 160 to 220 C.Typical lactones employed are gamma valerolactone dl 31 206 delta valerolactone 12,5 218 220 , and gamma butyrolactone 42 206 , the latter being preferred. These lactones are readily capable of dissolving the desired curatives and of reducing prepoly er and or curative viscosity.Conventional plasticiters such as dioctyl phthalate DOP , butyl benzyl phthalate, dipropylene glycol dibenzoate, etc. reduc4e viscosity but are far less effective than the lactones of this inven tion either in reducing viscosity or in solvating curative Equivalent ratios of the reactive components, curatives to prepolymer, ordinarily range from 0.751.10, with 0.85 1.05 being typical and 0.0 1.00 preferred. nis invention has significant advantages over spray systems of the primer art. Conventional one shot spray systems are based on MDI and are always moisturesensitive. Thry cannot be used under humid conditions without extensive blowing or foamig due to reaction with moisture. Those of this invention that utilize TDI are free from this limitation. Those of this invention based on MDI are less subject to blowing then one shot systems since they contain considerably less reactive.isocyanate e.g., 3 12 vs. 25 30 by weight of the one shot method . Another major advantage of the pre polymer spray system of this invention is reflected in the superior properties of the polyurethane it produces versus those of the one shot systems. This difference is well known in the industry and includes such important properties as abrasion resistance, cut and tear resistence and tensile strength. The spray system of this in entlon also has major advantages when compared to prepolymer systems dissolved in volatile solvents to facilItate spraying . The major advantages are 1.The spray can apply high coating thicknesses 25 40mil about 0.6 2.0 mm per pass whereas systems based on the above mentioned solvents can only apply 5 10 mii 0.13 0.25 mm . This decreases application e. 2, Tac free tire is very short 0.5 2.0 In. compared to solvented systems 15 30min. and allows quick recoat and handling. 3. The explosion and inhalation hazards associated with volatile solvents are avoided there are no limitations arising from environmental regulations on solvents there is very low toxIcIty i any. 4. Shrinkange of the coating is reduced or aliminated. 5. The present spray system has less volume than a tipical solvent system there is less material to store and handle. 6. The Dresent system gives little or no sag on vertical surfaces. Solvent systems tend to run. In order to spray throught conventional equipment, the viscosity is desirably 1 3000 cps, with 200 2000 being typical and 300 1000 preferred. This can be accomplished by reducing the viscosity of the prepolymer using a lactone such as gar a butyrolactone heating also reduces the viscosity, thereby reducing the amount of lactone that is employed and optirizing physical properties. Ordinary, the maximum temperature should desirably be about 210 F 100 C since prepolymers have limited thermal stability. Normally, a prepolymer lactone mixture may, in typical practice, contain from 1 to 100 parts of prepolymer, preferably from 10 to 100 and especially 75 to 100 parts per one part of lactone by weight. The curatives may be mixed with lactone so that the weight ratio of curative lactone may range, for example, from 1 10 to 100 1, preferably from 1 5 to 5 1 and most tre ferably from 1 2 to 2 1.The lactone ordinarily should preferably not be used at levels above 100 pth poly urethane prepolymer plus curative by weight in order to avoid polyurethane properties at levels lower than desired. For example, a range or 5 to 100 pph lactone to total polyurethane is frequently possible 10 50 pph is usually employed. The cuurative mixture contains a lactone if it is necessarly to place the curative s into solution. The lactone must be present iii sufficient volume to completely dissolve solid curative. ts level can be dusted above that to allow convenient formulation to standart spray mix ration such as 1 1, to 5 1 by volume. The invention provides what may be te ed a 100 solids polyurethane coating in the sense that the entire spray mixture remains as part of the final polyurethane and there is no questIon of removing by vaporiza tion a relatively large volume of solvent before the deposit is tack free or dried solidified or cured . The coating can be applied to a variety of surfaces by spray application. In the mining industry, for example, applications include conveyor idler rolls, cte and hopper linings, sump and talk linings and pipe fittings. Besides providing an abrasion resistant solid coating, the composition may be used as a moisture barrier, a release lining, or a chemical resistent coating. The coating also provides high gloss and can be readily pigmented.Typical physical property date for a 40 mil sample cured under ambient conditions are listed below Hardness, Shore A . . . . . . . . . . . 80 100 , Modulus, psi MPa .......... 800 5.5 300 , Modulus, psi MPa ..........1500 10.4 Tensile Strenght, psi MPa .......4000 27.6 Elongation, ..................... 400 Tear, D 624, Die C,pli KN m ..... 580 101 Tear, D 470, pli KN m ........... 100 17.5 Tear, Trouser, pli KN m ......... 170 29.8 Bell Brittle, C . . . . . . . .. . . . 62 Specific Gravity.............95 1.8 Depends on application Aging data for a 40 mil sample cured under ambient conditions are shown below Percent retention of tensile after aging Conditions Retention 3 Monts, 80 relative humidity, 158 F 70 C 50 70 1 Year, water immersion, 158 F 70 C 25 40 5 Years, water immersion, 75 F 24 C 80 100Volume swell after one week at 158 F 70 C Solvent SwellASTM Oil num 1 0.5ASTM Oil num 3 5 10Dioctyl phtalate 15 20Toluuene 50 75 The two parts of the present spray composition, nameley Part A containing the prepolymer amd Part B containing the curative dissolved in the lactone, are frequently employed at a mix ratio of 3 1 by volume, the recommendet processing temperature being 180 F 80 C .
