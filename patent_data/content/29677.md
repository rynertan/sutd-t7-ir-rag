# Organic grouting system for anchoring a bolt in a hole, and cartridge containing such composition.

## Abstract
An improved rock bolt grouting composition based on a cross linkable unsaturated polymerizable polyester resin formulation in one component and a peroxide catalyst in a separate component, contains diffused water, preferably in the catalyst component, in an amount sufficient to provide a weight ratio of resin formulation to water no greater than about 6.0, and a particulate solid filler in both components in an amount sufficient to provide a weight ratio of filler to resin formulation of at least about 3.0. The filled, water extended composition generally expands during the cross linking of the polymer, and greater interfacial strength in smooth walled boreholes has been found. Compositions in which water is the catalyst vehicle are preferred because their shelf life is better than those containing an oil based catalyst.
