# Process for preparing nonionic surfactants by oxyalkylation with promoted barium catalysts.

## Abstract
The process for preparing nonionic surfactants wherein a narrower molecular weight distribution is obtained by the use of a barium catalyst which comprises reacting a reactive hydrogen compound selected from the group consisting of monohydric alcohols having from 8 to 20 carbon atoms and a difunctional polypropylene oxide polymer having an average molecular weight in the range of 1000 to 5000 with an alkylene oxide having 2 to 4 carbon atoms at a tempera ture at which the reaction proceeds in the presence of at least a catalytic amount of a barium salt selected from the group consisting of barium hydroxide, barium alkoxides, barium phenoxides, hydrates thereof or mixtures thereof and a catalytic amount of an oxyalkylation catalyst promoter.
