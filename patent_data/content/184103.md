# Accessory drive device in engine.

## Abstract
A device which drives accessories such as an alternator or a cooling water pump utilizing output of an automobile engine, includes an input shaft installed to an output shaft of the engine, a nonstage transmission with differential planet ary mechanism of frictional transmission type installed between the shaft and a pulley connected to the accessory, and a pressure adjusting device for adjusting pressure of the frictional transmission oil retained in an annular chamber enclosing the continuously variable transmission. The press ure adjusting device forms a free liquid surface of the frictional transmission oil so that the variation in pressure of the frictional transmission oil is absorbed by the vertical movement of the free liquid surface.
