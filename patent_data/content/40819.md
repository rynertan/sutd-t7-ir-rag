# Printing cartridge.

## Abstract
A printing cartridge 10 is made of a pair of rigid half sections 11, 12 joined together along a plane parallel to the cartridge side walls. A spool 38 of printing tape 39 and spool 30 of printing ribbon 34 are rotatably supported in the cartridge 10 to allow said tape 39 and ribbon 34 to be withdrawn together and in mutually facing relationship through a guide member 14 integrally formed at the for ward side of the cartridge 10 . Three curved wall sections 40...42 formed on the inner surface of one cartridge section 11 retain the spool 38 of tape 39 in circular configuration and prevent the tape 39 from settling in the corners of the cartridge 10 . A leaf spring 49 is disposed in the cartridge 10 in biassed engagement with the tape 39 to limit the movement of the tape 39 to the forward direc tion only. The tape 39 and ribbon 34 are guided through the guide member 14 by guide posts 50, 51 which also serve to maintain separation between the tape 39 and ribbon 34 during withdrawal from the cartridge 10 . The guide member 14 furthermore has a notch 16 for engage ment with an alignment tab 19 provided at a forward position of a cartridge carrier 18 into which the cartridge 10 is inserted for operation.
