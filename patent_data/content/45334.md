## Description
PROPRANOLOL ANTIGEN CONJUGATES AND ANTIBODIES AND METHOD OF USING TIWM. The 8 adrenergic blocking agents are pharmacologically active drugs which block the ss adrenergic receptors. Propranolol, the best known member of the class is used to suppress arrhythmia, as well as in the treatment of hypertension. Other ss adrenergic blocking agents which have been studied are dichioroisoproterenol, pronethalol, sotalol, oxprenolol, practolol, and butoxamine. When these drugs are administered to a patient, it is important to determine the relation between administered dose and in vivo concentration for proper therapeutic response. In order to determine the level of the drug in the blood or other physiological fluid, sensitive tests which distinguish the drug from its metabolites and other concurrently administered drugs are necessary. Competitive protein binding assays can be used for such determination. For these assays1 there is a need for antibodies which are produced at high concentrations, bind to the drug, and only weakly bind to related drugs and metabolites which may be present. These antibodies are prepared using antigenic conjugates of derivatives of the drugs of interest. Additionally, such assays require a reagent which produces a measurable, reproducible signal in relation to the concentration of drug in the assay medium. This reagent must effectively compete with the drug of interest for antibody binding, and should provide an easily measurable change in signal with small changes of the drug concentration over the concentration range of interest, 10 400ng ml in the case of propranolol. Additionally, the reagent should remain stable under assay conditions, and should have a good storage life. Descriptions of competitive protein binding assays may be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,817,837, 3,850,752, 3,690,834, and in an article by Murphy, 27 J. Clin. Endocr.973 1967 . U.S. Patent No. 3,875,011 discloses glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase conjugates for use in homogeneous enzyme immunoassays. Preparation of antigenic conjugates and antibodies for a number of different drugs may be found in U.S. PatentsNos. 3,888,866, 3,766,162, 3,843,696 and 3,878,187, and preparation of certain antigenic conjugates of propranolol derivatives for use in a radioimmunoassay is described in an article by Specter, et al. 196 J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 517 523 1976 . See also U.S. Patent No. 4,070,492, which describes propranolol derivatives substituted at oxygen for the production of assay reagents. This invention provides compounds that are conjugates of antigens or enzymes and ss adrenergic blocking agents. The conjugates are useful in homogeneous enzyme immunoassays for the detection of g adrenergic blocking agents antigenic conjugates are employed for the preparation of antibodies and enzyme conjugates are employed as detectors. Additionally, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and esters derived from ss adrenergic blocking agents are provided which are useful in preparing the conjugates. Novel compositions are provided which are derivatives of ss adrenergic blocking agents whereby the amine nitrogen is substituted with a nonoxocarbonylalkyl or oxocarbonylalkyl substituent. The nonoxocarbonyl including the nitrogen analog or oxocarbonyl functionality is employed for conjugation to antigens, usually poly amino acids or polysaccharides, and enzymes. The antigenic conjugate is employed for the preparation of antibodies which are capable of selection of the subject blocking agent these antibodies have low cross reactivity to organic compounds of similar structure and are able to bind selectively. In combination with the enzyme conjugate, the antigenic conjugates can be used in homogeneous enzyme immunoassays for the detection of the subject blocking agent.The linking group between the side chain nitrogen atom and the nonoxo or oxocarbonyl functionality will normally have at least 1 carbon atom and not more than about 10 carbon atoms, preferably having from about 2 to 6 carbon atoms and more preferably 3 carbon atoms.It is normally aliphatic, and may have one or more heteroatoms in the chain, as well as one or more functionalities along the chain.

X and Z are taken together to form oxo or imino NH or can each be hydrogen if A is an antigenic poly amino acid or an enzyme. The carbinol may be the D or L enantiomer or mixtures thereof, including racemic. The preferred poly amino acid compounds will usually be of the following structureEMI5.1 wherein w is oxymethylene, wherein the oxygen is linked to the ring, or a bond. When W1 is oxymethylene, each of the other symbols linked to the ring is hydrogen except that either G1 and LÚ are taken together to form buta 1,3 dienylene 1,4 the two rings define naphthyl , on DÚ is acetamido, or QÚ is allyloxy. When WI is a bond, each of the other symbols linked to the ring is hydrogen except that either L1 and D1 are both chloro, or L1 and D1 are taken together to form buta 1,3dienylene 1,4, or G1 and E1 are both methoxy. V1is usually hydrogen but is methyl when W1 is a bond and G1 and E1 are both methoxy. Yl. is is usually hydrogen or isopropyl, but is tertiary butyl when V1 is methyl. X1 and zÚ are each hydrogen or are taken together to form oxo. RÚ is alkylene of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, either straight or branched chain, and preferably of from 2 to 3 carbon atoms. A1 is an antigenic poly amino acid or an enzyme. n1 is on the average from 1 to the molecular weight of A1 divided by 1000. If Awl is antigenic, nl is generally from about 1 to 500, and preferably is about 2 to 75. When AÚ is an enzyme, nÚ is usually about 1 to 30, and preferably is in the range of about 2 to 12. Illustrative groups for R1 are methylene, ethylene, ethylidene, propylene, methylethylene, butylene, hexylene, 3 aza 4 oxopentylene, and 2 butenylene. The preferred compounds which can be used as precursors to the antigen and enzyme conjugates of this invention will usually be of the following structure EMI6.1 wherein w2 is oxymethylene, wherein the oxygen is linked to the ring, or a bond. When w2 is oxymethylene, each of the other symbols linked to the ring is hydrogen except that either G2 and L2 are taken together to form buta 1,3 dienylene 1,4, or D2 is acetamido, or Q2 is allyloxy. When w2 is a bond, each of the other symbols linked to the ring is hydrogen except that L2 and D2 are both chloro, or L2 and D2 are taken together to form buta 1,3dienylene 1,4, or G2 and E2 are both methoxy. v2 is usually hydrogen but is methyl when w2 is a bond and G2 and E2 are both methoxy. Yê is usually hydrogen or isopropyl, but is tertiary butyl when Vê is methyl. X2 is oxo. R2 is the same as R. Preferably it is alkylene of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and more preferably of from 2 to 3 carbon atoms. J2 is hydrogen, hydroxy, or alkoxy of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, usually 1 to 3 carbon atoms, e.g. ethoxy. The antigenic poly amino acids which may be used in this invention will vary widely as to molecular weight and nature of the poly amino acid . The amino groups which provide the sites for linking will generally be present as terminal amino groups, as well as present in lysine, arginine, and histidine. Various protein types may be employed as the antigenic material. These types include albumins, serum proteins, e.g. globulins, ocular lens proteins, lipoproteins, etc. Illustrative proteins include bovine serum albumin, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, egg ovalbumin, bovine gamma globulin, etc. Alternatively, synthetic poly amino acids may be prepared having a sufficient number of available amino groups e.g. lysines. It is particularly useful for A or A to be an enzyme which will act as a detector in an immunoassay system, although enzymes will function as antigenic material as well, but will not normally be employed as such. For use in an immunoassay, a number of characteristics of the enzyme can be considered, e.g., substrates, cofactors, specificity, ubiquitousness, stability to temperature, pH optimum, turnover rate, and the like. Additional factors to be considered are the commercial availability of the enzyme, and the existence of already developed reproducible assays. In choosing an enzyme for commercialization, as compared to single or limited use for scientific investigation, there will be a number of desirable criteria. These criteria are set forth in U.S. patent No. 3,817,837. Particularly useful enzymes are the oxidoreductases and the hydrolases. When A or A1 is an oxidoreductase, it will generally be a dehydrogenase, more usually a dehydrogenase dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD or its phosphate, NADP , and even more usually a dehydrogenase also dependent on a CHOH substrate. More specifically, the enzyme may be malate dehydrogenase or glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase G6PDH . Hydrolases of particular interest include lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase and B galactosidase. While various sources of G6PDH may be employed, a particularly desirable source for the subject compounds is the bacterium L.mesenteroides. The particular value of theG6PDH from this bacterium is that it is able to utilize NAD.Therefore, one can limit interference from endogenous G6PDH which cannot utilize NAD by employing NAD as the co factor, when the subject compounds are used in immunoassays To form the compounds of the subject invention, a number of methods can be employed. Where the final product is formed by linking the nonoxocarbonyl functionality to the antigen or enzyme by an amide linkage, mixed anhydrides, particularly monoalkyl carbonate esters, carbodiimides or active esters e.g.N hydroxy succinimide or E nitrophenyl, may be employed for activating the carboxyl group. For amidine formation, alkyl imidates are satisfactory. For polysaccharides, linkage will be at hydroxyl groups and the same carboxyl activators may be employed for formation of esters. Alternately, the ester can be converted to the aldehyde using a reagent such as diisobutyl aluminum hydride.The aldehyde can then be conjugated to an amino group of the antigen or enzyme at the terminal carbon by reductive amination with a borohydride. The antibodies which are prepared in response to the conjugated antigens made in the above manner have strong specific binding to the parent drug as well as the enzyme conjugates used for the immunoassay.

The foregoing data illustrates that the compounds of the subject invention are effective in providing reagents which are useful in immunoassays for the determination of the ss adrenergic blocking agents, particularly propranolol. In addition, the antibodies which are provided are able to detect the presence of the blocking agents, especially propranolol, so that the subject assay can be used to provide a rapid determination of the concentration of these compounds in the blood. The subject ss adrenergic blocking agents are for the most part difficult to conjugate. The problems of preparing appropriate conjugates which may be used for the production of antibodies are overcome by employing the compounds of the subject invention. The antibodies produced using the conjugated antigens of the subject invention are found to provide the desired high binding constants for the desired group of compounds. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity and understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced,EMI18.1 EMI18.2
