# Structure for collecting solar rays.

## Abstract
A structure for positioning the light receiving edge of the optical fiber comprises a large number of lens for focussing the light, a large number of optical fibers, each having a photo receiving edge arranged on the focus of the lens. A supporting plate has a large number of holes coaxial with each of the optical axis of said lens. And retaining member retains the optical fiber movably along with the direction of the optical axis. The retaining member being bound with adhesive agent to the supporting plate, and the optical fiber being bound with the same to the retaining member.
