# Battery cell construction and method of forming.

## Abstract
A battery cell for generating electric energy has a sealed container partitioned into anode and cathode chambers. The partition has an electrolyte separator in the form of a bundle of hollow glass or ceramic fibres, fusion sealed together between their interstices adjacent at least one end thereof. Preferably, the ends 18 of the fibres which project within the anode chamber are sealed closed whereas the opposite ends 20 are in open communication with the cathode chamber. Preferred anode and cathode materials comprise an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium and sulphur respec tively.
