## Description
PLANAR FIELD SHAPED BIDIRECTIONAL POWER FET Background and Summary The invention provides planar lateral FET structure for bidirectional power switching, includingAC application. The invention particularly provides enhanced OFF state voltage blocking capability in a planar device by means of field shaping in the drift region to straighten out field lines and prevent curvature crowding in the drift region portion between the channels. This prevents gradient induced depletion and unwanted inversion of conductivity type along the drift region portion between the channels during theOFF state. As a result, for a given ON state resistance specification, a greater blocking voltage can be obtained or conversely, for a fixed OFF state blocking voltage requirement, a lower ON state resistance can be obtained. Copending Application Serial No. 390,562, filed June 21, 1982 discloses planar lateral AC powerFET integrated structure. Copending Application SerialNo. 421,931, filed September 23, 1982 discloses nonplanar AC power FET structure with current flow along the sides of a vertical notch, with a field shaping region forming a junction with the drift region opposite the channel containing region junctions. Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a sch√´matic sectional view of bidirectional power FET structure constructed in accordance with the invention. Detailed Description Fig. 1 shows bidirectional power FET 2 having a a common drift region 4 between a pair of spaced first and second channel containing regions 6 and 8 and first and second source regions 10 and 12. The first and second channels 14 and 16 are gated ON to invert the conductivity type thereof and afford conduction between said source regions 10 and 12 through drift region 4.In the OFF state, leftward current flow is blocked by junction 18, and rightward current flow is blocked by junction 20. FET 2 includes a substrate or epitaxial layer 22 of semiconductor material of one conductivity type, such as n type, on top of a base layer 24 of opposite conductivity type, such as p type. Base layer 24 provides the field shaping region, to be described. A pair of p tub regions 6 and 8 are diffused or ion implanted into epitaxial layer 22 through holes in silicon dioxide insulating layer 26 on top major surface 28.N regions 10, 30 and 12, 32 are diffused or ion implanted into respective p regions 6 and 8 through the same holes in the oxide layer, in accordance with known double diffusion processing technology. N regions 10, 30 are prevented from forming in the central section 34 of p region 6 by a separate masking step, or in accordance with known SIPMOS processing technology, and likewise for central ,section 36 of p tub 8. Both the p and the n diffusions are performed through the same hole, and thus the oxide edge such as 38 provides aligned registry. The diffusion parameters control the lateral penetration of p edge 18 and n edge 40, which in turn control the lateral length of channel 14 therebetween, sand likewise for channel 16.A multi cell matrix array is formed by a plurality of other p tubs such as 42, 44 and so on, with their respective n regions, formed during the same processing steps as described. Gate electrode means are provided having portions proximate the channels and adapted for application of electrical potential for producing electric fields of sufficient intensity to invert the conductivity type in the channels such that upon application of voltage of either polarity to the first and second source regions, electric current can flow in a respective corresponding direction between them, under control of the electrical potential of the gate electrode means. In one embodiment, as shown in copending Application Serial No. 390,719, filed June 21, 1982, a single gate electrode may be spaced above the top major surface and extend laterally across both channels. In another embodiment, split gate electrode means is provided as shown in above noted copending Application Serial No. 39 0,56 2, filed June 21, 1982. In Fig. 1, laterally spaced split gate electrodes 46 and 48 are deposited through an appropriate mask, followed by a top silicon dioxide insulating layer. Split gate electrodes 46 and 48 are insulated above and extend across respective channels 14 and 16. Main electrodes 50 and 52 are deposited in respective openings to ohmically contact respective source regions 10, 30 and 12, 32 and respective channel containing regions 6 and 8. Upon application of positive voltage to right gate electrode 48 with respect to right main electrode 52, electrons in p region 8 are attracted to top major surface 28 beneath gate 48 to thus invert the conductivity type in channel 16 to n type. Likewise upon application of positive voltage to left gate electrode 46 with respect to left main electrode 50, electrons in p region 6 are attracted to top major surface 28 beneath gate 46 to thus invert the conductivity type in channel 14 to n type. If left main electrode 50 is positive with respect to right main electrode 52, current may then flow from left main electrode 50, through left source region 10, through left channel 14, through drift region 4 along conduction path 54 beneath top major surface 28, then through right channel 16, through right source region 12, to right main electrode 52. The current is unipolar, i.e. consists only of majority carrier flow. The structure is bidirectional, and thus current may also flow from right main electrode 52 to left main electrode 50 when electrode 52 is positive with respect to electrode 50, and when the gates are turned on, i.e.made positive with respect to their respective main electrodes. In a gating technique disclosed in copendingApplication Attorney s Docket F9766 7, after initial field effect turn on, one of the gates is turned OFF to provide bipolar conduction. For example, with FET 2 turned ON and current flowing from left main electrode 50 to right main electrode 52, left gate electrode 46 is turned OFF by making it negative with respect to left main electrode 50. negative left gate electrode 46 attracts holes in p region 6 to thus revert channel 14 back to p type, thus rendering channnel 14 nonconductive. Current instead flows across junction 18 by means of minority carrier injection of holes from p region 6 into drift region 4. This injection across forward biased junction 18 affords conductivity modulation through substrate 4 and bipolar action at reverse biased junction 20. In an alternative gating operation, upon application of the positive voltage to right gate electrode 48 with respect to right main electrode 52, electrons in p region 8 are attracted to top major surface 28 to thus invert the conductivity in channel 16 to n type. If left main electrode 50 is positive with respect to right main electrode 52, current may then flow from p region 6 momentarily across forward biased PN junction 18 into drift region 4, then through right channel 16 to source 12 and to right main electrode 52.As soon as currrent starts to flow through the FET, the voltage across the main electrodes drops, which in turn reduces the potential in various regions of the FET, including the portion of p tub 6 below channel 14, which falling potential causes electrons to move toward top major surface 28 to thus invert channel 14 to n type and hence render channel 14 conductive. Forward biased PN junction 18 conducts only momentarily until the second channel 14 turnsON. The main current path through FET 2 is as before, from left main electrode 50, through left source 40, through left channel 14, through drift region 4 along portion 54, through right channel 16, through right source 12, to right main electrode 52. Reverse direction operation is comparable. In the OFF state, current from left main electrode 50 to right main electrode 52 is blocked by reverse biased PN junction 20. Right gate electrode 48 is turned OFF so that channel 16 is p type. Currrent flow in the other direction from right main electrode 52 to left main electrode 50 is blocked by junction 18, with left gate electrode 46 being turned OFF such that channel 14 is p type. Bidirectional PET 2 may be used to controlAC power. Fig. 1 schematically shows a load 56 and a source of AC power 58 connected across main electrodes 50 and 52. During the first halfcycle of AC source 58, with left main electrode 50 positive with respect to right main electrode 52, switch G2 is in its leftward position such that gating potential source 60 biases right gate electrode 48 positively with respect to references right main electrode 52. Channel 16 is thus inverted to n type. For fast turn on, switch G1 is also in its leftward position such that left gate electrode 48 is biased positively with respect to left main electrode 50 by gating potential source 62.Channel 14 is thus inverted to n type and conduction occurs as above described. Still during the first half cycle, after initial turn on, G1 is switched to its rightward position such that left gate electrode 46 is made negative with respect to left main electrode 50. This reverts channel 14 back to p type and thus forces current across forward biased PN junction 18, causing the above noted minority carrier injection and bipolar conduction. Before the end of the first halfcycle, G1 is switched back to its leftward position, making left gate electrode 46 positive with respect to left main electrode 50, and again inverting channel 14 to n type to thus short junction 18, and provide field effect conduction. This field effect conduction enables fast turn off at the end of the first halfcycle. Operation during the second halfcycle, with current flow leftwardly from right main electrode 52 to left main electrode 50, is comparable to that above described. The structure of FET 2 may be a multi cell matrix array incorporating a plurality of bidirectional power FETs integrated on a common substrate. For example, region 30 is part of the next FET cell to the left, and region 32 is part of the next FET cell to the right. Main electrode metallizations are provided and connected in series in the AC load line, or in parallel as shown in Fig. 1. Left gate electrodes 64, 66, and so on, are connected in parallel with left gate electrode 46 to left gate terminal 68. Right gate electrodes 70, 72, and so on, are connected in parallel with right gate electrode 48 to right gate terminal 74.In one of the halfcycles of AC source 58, main electrode 50 provides the source electrode for the FET to the left through drift region portion 76, and also provides the source electrode for the FET to the right through drift region portion 54, i.e. p tub pair 42 and 6 provide a FET cell to the left of main electrode 50, and p tub pair 6 and 8 provide a FET cell to the right of main electrode 50. Main electrode 52 provides the drain electrode for the FET through drift region portion 54, and also provides the drain electrode for the FET through drive region portion 78 provided by PET cell pair 8 and 44.In the other halfcycle of AC source 58, the roles of electrodes 50 and 52 are reversed, i.e. electrode 50 is the drain for its left and right FETs through respective drift region portions 76 and 54, and electrode 52 is the source for its left and right FETs through respective drift region portions 54 and 78. Alternate main electrodes 80, 52, and so on, are thus connected to one side of the AC source, and the other alternate main electrodes 50, 82, and so on, are connected to the other side of the AC source. Region 24 provides field shaping to straighten out field lines in the drift region and prevent curvature crowding of field lines particularly in drift region portions 76, 54, 78, and so on.Crowding of field lines may cause potential gradient induced depletion and unwanted inversion of conductivity type along the noted drift region portions between the ch√Öannel containing regions, especially beneath top surface 28. This in turn reduces OFF state voltage blocking capability. Field shaping region 24 is referenced to substantially the same potential level as the main electrodes through steering diode means comprising first and second diode junction barriers 84 and 86 integrated in the substrate. Diodes 84 and 86 are connected between the main terminals in series opposition, with p region 24 interposed therebetween. Diode junction 84 is formed by an n type isolation region 88 extending downwardly from top major surface 28 to bottom p layer 24. Isolation region 88 is part of epitaxial layer 22 but is isolated from drift region 4 and the channel containing regions and the source regions by isolation moats 90 and 92 extending down from top major surface 28 through epitaxial layer 22 into the field shaping region 24. Isolation moats 90 and 92 may be created by plasma etching, anisotropic etching, or isolation diffusion, as known in the art C.

Alternatively, the notches may be formed by a porous silicon region in accordance with the known anodization technique of passing a fixed current through the localized region in the presence of concentrated hydrogen fluoride to create a structural change in the silicon which remains single crystalline with the substrate but become porous. In the case of anisotropic etching, the notch may be filled with insulative material or with p material. In the case of anodization, the substrate may be subjected to an oxidizing atmosphere such that the oxygen enters the in inthe porous notched region and rapidly oxidizes these regions, which regions are still single crystalline with the substrate but substantially nonconductive. Alternatively, after the anodization, the notches may be etched quickly due to their porosity, and then filled with insulative material or p material. In a further alternative, an aluminum thermomigration process may be used W. G. Pfann,Solid State Physics, No. 4, 423, 1957 T. R. Anthony and H. E. Cline, Journal of Applied Physics, No. 47, 2550, 1976.During the diffusion or ion implantation of the n source regions such as 10, a like region 94 may be formed in the isolation region 88. Isolation region 96 is comparable. Means are provided for controlling the potential of field shaping region 24. Common main electrode metallization 80 ohmically contacts channelcontaining region 42 and its respective n source regions and also contacts isolation region 88 including region 94. Likewise, common main electrode metallization 82 ohmically contacts channel containing region 44 and its respective n source regions and also contacts isolation region 96. Field shaping region 24 is thus referenced through diodes 84 and 86 to the most negative of the main electrodes 80, 52, or 82, 50. In operation, during the OFF state, as the potential on main electrodes 52 and 80 rises, the potential in substrate drift region 4 increases across forward biased junction 20. The positive potential of substrate drift region 4 together with the negative potential of main electrodes 50 and 82 reverse biases reverse junction 18, and as this reverse bias increases, the drift region depletion spreads away from junction 18. Junction 98 between field shaping region 24 and drift region epitaxial layer 22 is likewise reverse biased due to the connection through diode 86 to the negative main electrodes 82, 50, i.e. drift region epitaxial layer 22 is positively biased across junction 20 from positive main electrode 52, and region 24 is negatively biased across junction 86 to main electrode 82.The depletion region around junction 98 thus spreads away therefrom upwardly into drift region epitaxial layer 22. During the OFF state, with a rising potential on main electrode 52, and the consequent rising potential in drift region 4, portion 54 becomes more and more positive with respect to gate electrode 48.Relative negative gate electrode 48 may thus attract holes in drift region 4 towards top major surface 28 and cause unwanted inversion of region 54 to p type, i.e. potential gradient induced depletion of electrons out of top surface region 54. An induced p type region 54 would provide a conductive path between p tubs 8 and 6 and thus between main electrodes 50 and 52, which would be a short circuit failure in the OFF state. As noted, the unwanted conductivity inversion in region 54 is caused by gradient induced depletion. The higher the gradient, the greater the curvature crowding of field lines in regions 76, 54, 78 and so on. Field shaping region 24, which is referenced to the most negative of the main electrodes, minimizes such potential gradient and consequent curvature crowding of field lines in drift region portions 76, 54, 78, particularly near top surface 28. The negative potential of layer 24 straightens or pulls the field lines out of drift region portions 76, 54t 78, and instead spreads such field lines laterally across epitaxial layer 22 so as to minimize the gradient in the drift region portions between the channel containing regions. This increases the OFF state voltage blocking capability. It is recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the appended claims.
