# METHOD OF APPLYING A GAS PERMEABLE MEMBRANE FOR BLOOD GAMETHOD OF APPLYING A GAS PERMEABLE MEMBRANE FOR BLOOD GAS SENSING ELECTRODE AND A DEVICE THEREOF S SENSING ELECTRODE AND A DEVICE THEREOF

## Abstract
An improved method of applying a gas permeable mem brane to an electrode portion of cutaneous blood gas sensor is disclosed, wherein a cushioning disk of porous material with one sided tackified sheet of substrate, preferably having a con vex shaped surface, is utilized when the membrane is applied to the surface of the electrode portion, to which a few drops of electrolyte solution have been supplied. According to the method of the present invention, a thin, uniform layer of elec trolyte solution between the membrane and electrode portion is obtained and shortened initial stabilization period, quick response, and minimized drift of the measurement are resulted.
