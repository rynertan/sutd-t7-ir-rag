A seal for preventing ingress or escape of fluid through a portion of a pipe 1 comprises a cover 10 which is preferably dimensionally recoverable and is coated on at least part of one surface thereof with a layer of sealant which will adhere to the pipe and which, when subjected to a strain in a peel mode applied between the cover 10 and pipe 1 sufficient to cause the adhesive bond so formed to fail, will fail cohesively at a temperature below 10 , preferably below 15 C and espe cially below 20 C. The seal is especially suitable for use on insulated pipes which are often used at low ambient temperatures, for exam ple district heating pipes.
