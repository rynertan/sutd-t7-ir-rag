# SYSTEM FOR SUPPLYING COMBUSTION AIR TO A SUPERCHARGED COMBUSTION ENGINE WITH CHARGE AIR COOLING

## Abstract
A system for controlling the charge air in a turbo charged vehicle diesel engine with a charge air cooler comprises a two way valve 10 having a position in which it conducts charge air from the compressor 6 via the charge air cooler 8 to the engine 1 cylinders, and a position in which it conducts the charge air past the cooler. The valve is controlled by the charge pressure and the ambient air temperature, so that essentially all of the charge air is led through a shunt pipe 9 past the cooler at a given low engine load low charge pressure and low temperature, which makes it possible to reduce particle, gas and noise emissions from the engine. As the ambient air temperature rises, the charge pressure limit at which the valve opens to supply charge air to the engine is lowered, so that the engine is supplied with charge air at a temperature determined by the load and engine speed, and independent of the ambient temperature.
