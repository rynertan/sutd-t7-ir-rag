# Built liquid detergent compositions and method of preparation.

## Abstract
A stable homogeneous aqueous liquid detergent composition contains 22 to 35 by weight of soduim triphosphate and 6 to 15 by weight of an active deter gent mixture comprising a a water soluble anionic sul phonate or sulphate detergent b an alkali metal soap of fatty acids having 12 to 18 carbon atoms, and c a nonionic detergent, in a weight ratio of 5.5 8.5 0.5 3 1.5 3 . The composition is a pourable liquid having a visco sity of 0.35 1.0 Pa s measured at 20 C and at 21 sec onds ยน shear rate and remaining stable after at least two 24 hour cycles of from 4 C to ambient temperature. Preferably the composition is prepared by mixing the ingredients in the proper sequence.
