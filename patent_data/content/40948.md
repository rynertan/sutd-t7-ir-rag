# Method of making an electro dynamic transducer.

## Abstract
The magnet part and the coil diaphragm part are made in separate steps and are then assembled. The coil diaphragm part is made in a plurality of successive stations first a plane diaphragm material is adhered to one side of the carrier ring 10 , and then a heat ac tivatable glue is applied to the diaphragm in the region where the coil 15 is to be attached, and finally the diaphragm is formed with a heat emitting tool simul taneously with the coil 15 being pressed against the heat activated glue. The transducer has a diaphragm 13 connected to a coil 15 which is movable in a slit 6 between the pole shoes 3, 4 of a magnet 5 , the pole shoes 3, 4 being fitted coaxially on a guide pin 2 . To provide for exact centering of the coil 15 in the slit 6 , a carrier ring 10 , to which the diaphragm 13 is secured so that the coil 15 is concentric with the carrier ring 10 , engages an outwardly facing, annular face 12 of the outermost pole shoe 3 .
