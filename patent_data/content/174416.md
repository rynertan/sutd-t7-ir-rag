# Signboard rack.

## Abstract
A signboard rack according to the invention is designed to receive at least two opposite side edges of a signboard or the like. The signboard rack includes longitudinal bars 1 of uniform cross section which are adapted for interconnection at generally right angles relative to each other and consist each of a hollow profile having a longitudinally extending slit 3 , and connection members 2 interconnecting said bars and consisting each of a first part insertable in said hollow in one of the profiled bars and also a second part joined with the first part via said slit and insertable in the end of another one of the profiled bars, while the first part is fixable in the intended position along the profiled bar associated therewith in that the second part can be acted upon in such a way that the first part will be fixed or released relative to said hollow. The connection member is preferably made in one piece of an elastically yieldable material and is fixed in position in the profiled bars by spring action.
