## Description
Liquid Egg Compositions Containing Storage Stable Solid s Field of the Invention This invention relates to liquid egg compositions containing storage stable solids, e.g., cheese or cheese analogs and more particularly, to such compositions also having reduced calorie and or cholesterol content.Background of the Invention Eggs are a valuable food product known as an important source of nutrients such as proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals. Yeggs are also valued as a food for their distinctive flavor, mouthfeel and other organoleptic properties and as such are very desirable for eating by themselves. The majpr parts of an egg are the shell composed mostly of calcium carbonate the white composed mostly of proteins and the yolk which is mostly a complex mixture of lipids and proteins. Mixtures of egg ,white and yolk are referred to as whole egg. Liquid egg products, as the term is used herein, are processed compositions of egg white, yolk or whole ego, optionally including minor amounts of additives such as preservatives, stabilizers, texturizers, or the like. In theUnited States, egg products are processed to meet Government specifications relating to microbe content, chemical composition, and physical properties. Processing typically involves separating the white and yolks from their shells, pasteurizing and mixing the products thereof with lesser portions of additives. Separation of the shells from the white and yolk usually involves cooling the unbroken eggs to about 10C, washing, rinsing, sanitizing, flash candling ani thereafter breaking the shells and collecting the yolks and whites separately.Suitable pasteurization techniques are discussed in the Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, KirkOthmer, John Wiley Sons, Vol. 8, pp. 429 445 the text of which is incorporated herein by reference. Findings implicating high blood cholesterol levels and high saturated fat intake in humans with the onset and or severity of cardiovascular disease and public interest in low calorie diets has stimulated the development of modified egg products containing less cholesterol and saturated fat than products made with whole eggs. Whole egg contains about 548 mg cholesterol and 6.7 g of saturated fat per 100 g and all of these constituents are found in the yolk. See Composition of Foods, Dairy and Egg g Products, Raw Process Dried, Agriculture Handbook No. 8 1, Agriculture ResearchService, U.S.D.A. 1976 .Modified liquid egg products having reduced levels of cholesterol and saturated fats may be prepared by removing at least some, and preferably all, of the yolk from the egg white and substituting additives that provide the white with organoleptic properties and coloring similar to whole eggs. The number of caloriesRin such products may be reduced incidentally by the reduction of yolk content. One example of such a modified egg product is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,911,11111, Which is incorporatei herein by reference, and which discloses a substantially cholesterol free composition having a high degree of freeze thaw stability comprising from about 24 to 99.5S wt.egg white and typically from about 0.005 to about 0.3 wt.xantham gum. Such egg products may be refrigerated or frozen and show little or no separation of their components when thawed. The thawed products have a viscosity similar to fresh whole eggs and when cooked, e.g., scrambled, produce a food having organoleptic properties similar to fresh scrambled whole eggs. Another example of a low cholesterol reduced calorie modified egg product that simulates fresh whole egg in cooked dishes is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,295,134, which is incorporated herein by reference, which product comprises about 60 to 96 parts by weight liquid egg white 0 to 18 parts water 2 to 15 parts of a protein replacement such as nonfat dry milk solids, powdered egg albumin and or soy protein and small quantities of stabilizer, flavoring, and coloring. These liquid egg products may be refrigerated or frozen for storage. Consumer oriented egg products and modified egg products for preparing popular egg dishes that have the organoleptic properties of fresh whole eggs are highly desirable for their economy, high nutrition, convenience, and appeal as a food. Moreover, egg product dishes which include discrete cheese portions or cheese tlavored particles, i.e.pieces, that are added to eggs before cooking to enhance and modify the natural egg flavors and provide discrete zones of natural or imitation cheese are also very desirable. The cheese solids included in such dishes may be particles of natural andtor synthetic cheese cut to a suitable size for incorporation into egg dishes, such as scrambled eggs, omelets or the like, and large enough to provide discrete regions of the melted cheese solids in the final cooked egg dish. Egg recipes calling for cheese solids to be added to eggs before cooking are well known in the art, but it has heretofore not been practical to add cheese solids to liquid egg products and modified liquid egg products that are to be refrigerated or frozen for substantial periods of time without undesirable softening and disintegration of the cheese particles that causes them to blend with the eggproduct and lose their structural identity so that they are no longer capable of forming discrete softened or melted cheese solids in cooked egg dishes prepared therefrom. In other words, such egg and cheese products are not storage stable under either refrigerator or freezer temperatures.Thus, the cooked egg dishes prepared from such products after storage have neither the appearance nor organoleptic properties of fresh scrambled eggs, or omelets, with cheese. The major drawbacks to using many cheese solids in liquid egg products are that they rapidly liquify or melt and agglomerate on standing in the egg products and typically form a gooey mass that adheres to their containers or blends into the egg product. Therefore, when a cooked food such as scrambled eggs is prepared therefrom, the presence of the cheese solid will be unnoticeable in the cooked food, except for whatever it contributes to the overall flavor or it may form one or a few undesirable large masses of sticky material in the product container or cooked food, e.g. it may lose the texture, consistency and mouthfeel of discrete melted cheese particles in the cooked food. When cheese solids are incorporated into egg products in accordance with the present invention, these drawbacks may be avoided. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides ready to cook, storage stable, egg and cheese compositions comprising a liquid egg base containing a plurality of discrete cheese solid particles said particles having a moisture index of about 3 or less and a melt index of about 1 or less wherein said cheese particles substantially retain their structural integrity during storage for at least 7 days at refrigerator temperatures. A composition in accordance with the present invention comprises a liquid egg base containing a plurality of discrete cheese particles said particles having a moisture index of about 3 or less and a melt index of about 1 or less wherein said cheese particles substantially retain their structural integrity during storage at freezer temperatures. This invention also provides methods of preparing ready to cook, storage stable egg and cheese products comprising the steps of combining liquid egg base with a plurality of cheese solid particles said particles having a melt index of about 1 or less and a moisture index less than about 3. The cooked egg and cheese dishes of the present invention may be prepared by mixing a liquid egg base with a plurality of cheese solid particles said particles having a moisture index of about 3 or less and a melt index of about 1 or less, and heating the mixture until the egg protein coagulates forming a semi solid mass having discrete melted cheese particles dispersed therein. The present invention also provides methods of preparing cooked 2gg dishes and products thereof from the liquid egg and cheese compositions of this invention. As hereinafter described in detail, the invention can provide ready to cook, storage stable, liquid egg products including cheese solids which retain their shape and do not agglomerate or disintegrate liquify when incorporated in liquid egg products for at least 7 days at refrigerator temperatures of about 32 45 F and, at least 3 months, preferably up to a year or more, when stored at conventional freezer temperatures of about 5 F to 100F, and which after storage form discrete regions of softened or melted cheese textured solids in cooked egg products prepared therefrom. The invention can also provide storage and freeze thaw stable ready to cook egg products with reduced cholesterol, saturated fats, and or calories, i.e. modified egg products, including cheese solids that produce, even after extended periods of storage at freezer temperatures, a scrambled egg type egg dish with discrete cheese solid regions having organoleptic properties that closely resemble an omelet prepared from a fresh whole egg mixture including diced cheese pieces. Furthermore, as hereinafter described, the present invention can also provide methods for preparing ready to cook egg and cheese products, including a liquid egg base and cheese solids that are storage stable for at least 7 days at refrigerator temperatures between about 32 F 45 F and, at least 3 months, preferably up to a year, or more at temperatures below 32 F, and after said storage period said products may be cooked to provide a cooked egg dish, e.g., a cheese omelet having discrete, melted or softened, textured cheese regions. Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments of the Invention Ready to cook, storage stable egg and cheese products of the present invention may be prepared by adding cheese solids having a specified moisture index and melt index to a liquid egg base. Liquid egg base may be whole egg or a processed egg composition derived from the whites and or yolks of eggs. Such processed egg compositions may be prepared from egg whites and additives that impart desirable organoleptic properties such as flavor, mouthfeel, viscosity, and coloring etc. to the composition before and or after cooking and may further include vitamins or other fortifiers, preservatives, and the like. Preferably, such processed egg compositions are based on egg whites and are comprised of about 20 to 100 by weight egg white, and more preferably 24 to 99.5 by weight egg white, plus texturizers and or other additives mentioned herein. Modified liquid egg products useful herein comprise from about 20 to 99.5 by weight liquid egg white and more preferably about 70 99.5 0 to about 1.0 by weight gum or mixtures thereof such as guar, xanthan, carrageenan, carboxymethyl cellulose, or the like O to about 8 by weight nonfat dry milk solids 0 to about 15 by weight oil such as corn oil, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, or the like O to about 1.0 by weight of emulsifier and 0 to about 3 by weight colorings, vitamins, flavorings, and the like.The precise quantities of the above ingredients used in a particular modified egg product are selected, insofar as possible, to restore the organoleptic properties and coloring of whole egg lost by elimination of the yolks without significantly increasing the cholesterol and saturated fat concentrations and further to impart a viscosity similar to that of whole egg and freeze thaw stability, i.e., the tendency of the modified egg product to separate into distinct layers while being thawed from the frozen state. Such products are commercially available, e.g., the Nabisco Brands, Inc. EGG BEATERS type products The above mentioned gums, particularly guar, xanthan, carrageenan and carboxymethyl cellulose, advantageously modify the viscosity and freeze thaw stability of the modified egg products.These gums are available from various commercial suppliers such as Hercules Inc., FMC Corp.and Kelco Co., and are preferably used in the present egg compositions to the extent of about 0.1No.5 . The nonfat dry milk solids and like materials optionally employed in the above described modified egg products are desirable as an additional source of protein and may improve the texture of cooked egg products and reduce the separation of water therefrom. Preferably about 0.5 5Z of nonfat dry milk solids will be employed in the present liquid egg products. The above mentioned oil in part replaces the oils naturally present in the eliminated egg yolk. Vegetable oils such as corn, cottonseed, soybean, safflower, sunflower, peanut, rape seed, olive, and sesame oils and mixtures thereof are preferred because they contain less saturated fats and cholesterol than other usable oils. Preferably about 7.5 12 of vegetable oil will be used in the egg products useful in the present invention. Corn oil is particularly preferred. The oil may also be useful for dispersing oil soluble colorings in the modified egg product. The emulsifier, optionally employed, in the above described modified liquid egg product, e.g. lecithin, or another food compatible synthetic or natural emulsifier, is principally useful for preventing the modified egg product from sticking to the vessel in which it is cooked. Of the synthetic emulsifiers,. polyoxy lower alkylene mono and diglycerides are preferred. The total emulsifier will preferably comprise about 0.25 0.75 by weight of the liquid egg product. Emulsifiers also may influence the texture and homogeneity of the modified egg product both before and after cooking. Lecithin is a preferred emulsifier because it is a natural component of egg yolk. A useful low cholesterol modified egg product may be prepared as follows A suitable vessel is charged with 3,254 pounds of liquid egg white, then 71 pounds of corn oil is added at 32 to 45F. These ingredients are thoroughly mixed. A mixture of dry ingredients is prepared by blending the following ingredients 6.39 pounds of carboxymethyl cellulose, 1.97 pounds of xanthan gum, 0.3 pounds of anhydrous aluminum sulfate, 0.17 pounds of ferric orthophosphate, 0.0044 pounds of thiamine mononitrate, 0.0044 pounds of riboflavin and 28.5 pounds of nonfat dry milk and the blended mixture is then added to the previousiy combinesd t materials with thorough mixing.An additional 329 pounds of corn oil is then added to this mixture, at ambient 1 temperature, with agitation to produce a base mixtut A premix is prepared in a separate vessel as follows 75 pounds of corn oil is heated to from 13Qe to 1500F and then 11.7 pounds of lecithin and 10 pounds Or Myvatex 3 50 a blend of mono and diglycerides and propylene glycol manufactured by D.P.I. Div. Eastman Chemical Products Co. are added with mixing. After mixing for 10 to 15 minutes, a small amount of a flavoring agent and a mixture comprising 0.157 pounds of PIGMENTENE Yellow Gold an extract of plant xanthophylls available from Special Nutrients, Inc.Surfside, Fla. , 0.11 pounds of a 30 percent dispersion of beta carotene, and 0.00232 pounds of vitamin D in oil is added and thoroughly mixed. This hot premix is then added to the base mixture with blending. Thereafter the total ingredients mix is pasteurized by heating at a temperature of about 136if, for about 5 minutes and then passed through a Manton Gaulin two stage homogenizer, the first stage being at 1000 psi and the second stage being at 500 psi. The homogenized product is then tested to confirm that it has an appearance and organoleptic properties similar to fresh whole eggs in both the cooled and uncooked states. Cheese solids suitable for use in the present invention include natural and synthetic cheeses of any variety such as cheddar, swiss, mozzarella or the like, having a melt index less than about 1 and a moisture index of less than about 3, as explained in greater detail below.An example of a natural commercial cheese product with the above properties is KRAFT HI MELT SWISS available fromKraft, Inc., Memphis, Tenn. An example of a commercially available synthetic cheese with the above properties isAMERICAN CHEESE SUBSTITUTE available from Schreiber Foods,Inc., Green Bay, Wis. The cheese solids useful in the present invention have a melt index of about 1 or less and a moisture index less than about 3, so that particles thereof will not lose their structural identity nor degrade in less than 72 hours when stored in water at 400 F, as determined by tests set forth in greater detail below and may derived from be commercially available natural or synthetic cheeses such as swiss, cheddar, mozzarella, or the like. Cheese solids having the requisite melt index and moisture index will contain about 30 45 by weight water, about 15 25 by weight fat, 15 25 by weight protein, 0 5Z by weight salt, and minor amounts of other ingredients such as colorants, flavorings, vitamins, and other cheese compatible ingredients. So long as the cheese solids have the requisite melt index and moisture index the cheese particles may also be prepared from about 30 40 by weight water, about 15 20 by weight casein, about 15 20 by weight oil, as hereinabove described, preferably partially hydrogenated soybean oil, about 0 15 by weight natural cheese, about 0 10 by weight whey, about 1 5 by weight skim milk, about 0 5 by weight salt, about 0 5 by weight enzyme modified cheese, about 00.3 by weight antimicrobial agent such as sorbic acid or its calcium, potassium and sodium salts, about 0 1 by weight disodium phosphate, a sufficient quantity of acid such as lactic acid to adjust the pH of the mixture to about 6 or less a sufficient quantity of one or more mineral emulsifiers to adjust the melt index of the finished cheese solid to about 1 or less, such as sodium hexametaphosphate or tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and about 0 10J additional flavoring and coloring. An exemplary cheese formulation is Ingredients By WeightCasein 18.0Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil 18.0Whey Reduced Lactate 5.0Skim Milk 4.8Sodium Hexametaphosphate 2.5Lactic Acid 7.0Salt 2.5Swiss Cheese natural 10.0Enzyme Modified Cheese 2.5Di sodium Phosphate 0.5 Sorbic Acid 0.2Artificial Coloring and Flavoring 0.1Water 35.2 The suitability of a cheese solid, for use in the products of the present invention is determined by its moisture index and melt index.A moisture stable cheese solid has the requisite melt index of about one or less and a 1 4 inch cube thereof can be placed in 180 cc of deionized water for 72 hours at a temperature of 40 F and the cube does not disintegrate into a melted mass but substantially retains its cubical shape. Moisture index may be determined by placing 60 gms.of 1 4 cubic inch cheese solid cubes in 180 g of deionized water in a 400 ml covered beaker for three days 72 hrs under refrigeration at about 40 F. If after the three days the water is milky, and the cheese solid cubes have rounded edges and are stuck together but not melted into. a solid mass, the cheese solid has an acceptable moisture index less than about 3 for purposes of the present invention. In contrast, if the water has become very cloudy milky and the cheese solid cubes have lost their shape, e.g., edges are severely rounded forming a sticky melted mass agglomeration , they will not be useful in making the storage stable egg and cheese compositions of the present invention.Moisture test results are quantitated usine the following table TABLE IMoisture Index Appearance Cube Consistency Water clear to slightly milky Firm body Hard 1 Cubes well defined, sharp edges Surface not sticky No tendency for cubes to stick together Water milky Firm to slightly firm body 2 Cubes slightly rounded edges Surface may have slight layer of soft cheese No tendency for cubes to stick tpgether 3 Water milky Soft to sticky Boarder Cubes rounded edges, some Large numbers line melted appearing of cubes stuckAccepta cheese may be visible together but bility not melted into a mass Water very milky, may have Very sticky dissolved cheese layer Difficult to floating on surface identify cubes or to separate them 4 Cubes severely rounded edges Cheese has melted appearance formed a large melted mass As indicated in Table I above, cheese solids having a moisture index less than about 3 are suitable for purposes of the present invention and are sometimes referred to herein as moisture stable cheese solids. Melt index criteria for cheese solids suitable for use in the present invention is measured by a melt test wherein a cheese solid dise 4.76 mm thick and 39.5 mm in diameter is placed in the center of a covered petri dish and heated to 450 F for five minutes. The melted cheese solid is then cooled for thirty minutes centered over a measuring device for determining its melt index. The measuring device comprises a series of numbered concentric circles having diameters incrementally increasing by 6.5 mm. The center circle is numbered 1 and has a diameter of 40 mm the next circle, moving outwardly, is numbered 2 and has a diameter of 46.5 mm and the renaining circles 3 11 are similarly arranged.A test samplers melt index is measured by determining the largest circle that the melted sample touches and assigning a melt index corresponding to the number of that circle. If a melted cheese solid displays a melt index greater than about 1, it is not acceptable. Cheese solids having acceptable melt test and moisture index characteristics may be incorporated into the above described modified egg product or other egg products and then aseptically packaged, for example, in 8.5 oz.containers, or the like, so that substantially equivalent quantities of cheese solid is put in each container. An egg and cheese, storage stable product in accordance with the present invention may be prepared by cutting or dicing a cheese solid loaf, said cheese having a moisture index of about 3 or less and a melt index of about 1 or less, into small pieces, e.g., 1 3 8 inch cubes and combining the cubes with a liquid egg base as described above. Cubes of about 1 4 cubic inch are preferred because such cubes are more or less uniformly dispersed in liquid egg bases having a viscosity similar to whole egg when shaken or mixed.Thus aliquots of an egg and cheese product that contain about the same proportion of cheese solid particles as present in the whole can be readily obtained. The proportion of cheese solid to egg base in the egg and cheese products of the invention may be varied as desired to obtain selected cooked egg dishes therefrom. However, egg and cheese products having about 10 to 45 , preferably about 25 , by weight cheese solids are preferred because they may be cooked to provide products that closely resemble conventional cheese omelets. A cooked egg and cheese product such as an omelet in accordance with the present invention may be prepared by melting approximately 12 g of margarine until it bubbles and coats a suitable cooking vessel such as an 8 inch skillet and then adding about 240 g of a egg and cheese product prepared in accordance with the foregoing disclosure, cooking is continued in the vessel until a semi solid mass is formed, the semi solid mass may then be folded into the familiar omelet crescent shape and turned to insure equal cooking and if desired slight browning on both sides. The resulting cooked egg product closely resembles a conventional cheese omelet prepared with whole eggs.Example I Liquid Egg Base Another liquid egg base useful in the present invention is prepared by combining the following ingredients Ingredients S by weight Liquid Egg White 98.50 Water 0.50 Corn Oil 0.28 Xanthan Gum 0.12 Guar Gum 0.07 Carrageenan 0.02 VitaminSMineral Premix 0.35 Colorings 0.16 The mixed ingredients are pasteurized by heating to a temperature of 136eF for about 5 minutes and then homogenized by passing the mixture through aManton Gaulin two stage homogenizer, the first stage being at 1000 psi and the second stage being at 500 psi.The homogenized liquid egg is then tested by well known methods which confirm that it has the organoleptic properties and coloring of whole eggs in both the cooked and uncooked states.Example II A ready to cook egg and cheese product is prepared by dicing KRAFT HIGH MELT SWISS cheese into 1 4 inch cubes and placing 2 oz. portions thereof in suitable containers. Approximately 6 oz. of the liquid egg base, prepared in Example I above, is then added to the container to form the egg and cheese product. It is possible to store this egg and cheese product for at least 3 months and preferably a year or more at freezer temperatures and at least 7 days at temperatures less than about 45 F, without loss of the product s functional characteristics that is, the product can be thawed, if necessary, and cooked to produce an omelet that closely resembles a fresh omelet prepared with whole egg and cheese.Example III A ready to cook egg and cheese product is prepared by dicing Schreibers AMERICAN CHEESESUBSTITUTE into 1 4 inch cubes and placing 2 oz. portions thereof in suitable containers. Approximately 6 oz. of the liquid egg base, prepared in Example I above, is then added to the container to form the egg and cheese product. It is possible to store this egg and cheese product for at least 3 months and preferably a year or more at freezer temperatures and at least 7 days at temperatures less than about II5F, without loss of the product s functional characteristics that is, the product can be thawed, if necessary and cooked to produce an omelet that closely resembles a fresh omelet prepared with whole egg and cheese.Example IV One 8.0 oz. container of the egg and cheese product prepared in Example III which has been stored for more than 7 days at refrigerator or freezer temperatures is shaken well and would be thawed if necessary. The shaken egg and cheese product is poured into a greased heated 8 inch skillet and cooked to a semi solid mass for about 3 minutes with periodic gentle agitation.Then the semi solid mass is folded into a crescent and slight browned on both sides. The resulting cooked egg dish has an appearance and organoleptic properties similar to an omelet prepared with fresh whole egg including discrete pieces of melted cheese.
