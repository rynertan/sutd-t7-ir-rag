# ROTARY ARC TYPE GAS FILLED SWITCH

## Abstract
The present invention discloses a gas filled switch with an improved arc extinguishing characteristics. Such gas filled switch comprises a gas filled casing, a pair of elec trodes disposed in the casing, a conductive retaining ring which encircles at least one of the electrodes, a permament magnet of a cylindrical configuration mounted on the retain ing ring, a conductive cylindrical body disposed in one end opening of the retaining ring, and an arc drive coil en circling the conductive cylindrical body and having one end connected to the conductive cylindrical body and other end connected to the electrode. Due to such construction, one root of an arc generated between the electrodes is moved from one electrode to the conductive cylindrical body so that the other root of the arc is subjected to the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet while the previous one root of the arc is subjected to the magnetic flux of the arc drive coil so as to extinguish the arc during the rotation of the arc.
