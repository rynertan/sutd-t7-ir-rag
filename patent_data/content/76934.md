## Description
A process for making the body of a vehicle utilising outer cladding elements made of synthetic plastics resinsThe present invention relates to a process for making the body of a vehicle utilising outer cladding elements made of synthetic plastic resins. In particular the present invention relates to a process which further utilises a monolithic lattice support structure constructed of sheet steel and of the type described in a previous Patent application by the same Applicant and entitled a support structure for motor vehicles filed 19th May, 1980.It is known that the current energy problems are causing vehicle manufacturers to develop relatively light vehicles to reduce the fuel consumption. One of the most efficient systems for reducing the weight of current motor vehicles is that of replacing the present sheet steel bodies with bodies made of plastics resins. Several motor vehicles of this type are known, in which, onto a metal framework provided with all the mechanical members there is mounted a vehicle body of moulded plastics material, usually fibreglass. The body is self supporting, and except for the movable elements bonnet, doors, tail gate is obtained by means of a single moulding operation.The solution described has many serious disadvantages both of a constructional nature and for the user. In particular, the necessity of obtaining a self supporting cladding structure bodywork which can be mounted on the mechanical frame makes it necessary, because of the limitations of current technology, to mould the structure in a single unit and with costly materials fibreglass type by a process already widely tried and tested in the field of small boats. This involves very high manufacturing costs both because of the materials and above all because of the costs of the moulding machinery, which must be of large dimensions. Moreover, this process is slow and therefore, for the present, technically unsuitable for mass production runs.The fibreglass structures are, moreover, relatively rigid and therefore do not lend themselves to very much deformation to absorb the energy of a possible collision. Therefore vehicles with known plastics resin bodies are not totally secure for the passengers.Finally, in the case of localised impacts the repairs are very difficult to perform since the body is not made from removable and replaceable elements apart from the movable elements doors, bonnet etc., .The object of the present invention is that of providing a process for making the bodywork of a vehicle body utilising external cladding elements of synthetic plastics resins and a monolithic lattice support structure of sheet steel of the type such as that described by theApplicant in the application entitled support structure for a motor vehicle filed 19.9.1980, in such a way as to provide a body free from the described disadvantages. A further object of the present invention is that of providing a process of the above mentioned type which can be performed simply and rapidly and which does not require expensive moulding equipment, in such a way as to be able effectively to be utilised for mass production.The said objects are achieved by the present invention in that it relates to a process for making the outer cladding of the body of a motor vehicle utilsing outer cladding elements made of synthetic plastics resins and a monolithic lattice support structure made from sheet steel and comprising closed lateral frames joined together by crosspieces, characterised by the fact that it comprises a first stage in which a first plurality of the said cladding elements are assembled together and joined by fixing means able to render the said elements rigidly connected together and to seal the junctions between these to form self supporting assemblies which can be fixed to the said support structure a second stage, comprising a plurality of successive operations in which the said self supporting assemblies and a second plurality of the said cladding elements are fixed on the support structure by mechanical connection elements, sealing adhesive plastics substances being disposed along the junctions between the said elements and a third stage for fixing a synthetic plastics resin roof panel into an upper opening in the said support structure by means of a string of an adhesive plastics substance disposed on a rim of the said support structure delimiting this opening, the said substance being able to elastically join the said roof panel to the said support structure to allow substantially independent movements thereof the said adhesive plastics substance being constituted by two component adhesives which polymerise at ambient temperature, and at least some of the said outer cladding elements being constituted by sheets of composite material SMC .For a better understanding of the present invention there is now given a non limitative description of an exemplary embodiment thereof with reference to the attached drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates a block schematic diagram of a cladding process for a motor vehicle body formed according to the principles of the present invention Figure 2 is an exploded view of a detail of a vehicle body formed with the process of the present invention Figures 3,4 and 5 schematically illustrate partial exploded views of a vehicle body at the beginning of successive operations in the process of the invention Figure 6 schematically illustrates a stage in the process of the invention and Figure 7 schematically illustrates several sections of a body formed with the process of the invention.With reference to Figure 5 there is generally indicated by the reference numeral 1 a body of a motor vehicle comprising a support structure 2 made of sheet metal and clad with a plurality of elements made of synthetic plastics resin and comprising a frontaidpiece 3, a rear m piece4, front and rear side doors 5 and 6, a tailgate 7 and a bonnet 8 at the front, front wings 9 and an upper roof panel 10. With reference also to Figures 3 and 4 which illustrate two different assembly stages of the body 1, the support structure 2 is a monolithic rigid lattice structure and comprises two closed lateral frames 11 joined together by crosspieces 12. Each frame 11 includes two horizontal longerons 13 joined by two lateral struts 14 and a central column 15. The structure 2 is made of pressed sheet steel and spot welded electrically. A similar structure is described in the application by the Applicant entitled support structure for motor vehicles filed 19th May, 1980. The structure 2 further has a rear frame element 16 and a rear frame element 18 provided with holes, brackets and other supports for mechanical connection members. The element 16 includes two longerons 19 parallel to the longerons 13 and rigidly connected to the frame 11 and two crosspieces 20 and 21.The crosspiece 21 is able to support an engine and the associated mechanical members, whilst the longerons 19 have curved tacing surfaces and forwardly tapering spaces and are able to serve as supports for the front sus pensions of the vehicle of which the body 1 forms part.Similarly, the rear struts 14 re able to support the rear suspensions of the said vehicle. The frames 11 are finally provided with continuous support surfaces 22 for the doors 5 and 6, which can serve as abutments for respective peripheral edges 23 of the doors 5 and 6 and to make a seal with these, and support seats 24 for the closure members of the doors 5 and 6.The separation between the engine space, delimited by the element 16, and the passenger compartment, delimited by the frames 11, is obtained in part by means of the crosspiece 21, which defines a substantially vertical lower separating bulk head, and in part by means of a self supporting separation assembly 25 which is mounted on the structure 2 parallel to ardabove the crosspiece 21. The assembly 25 comprises a first element 26 of plastics material provided with means for fixing it to the structure 2 for example brackets and a second element 27 facing the passenger compartment and made of plastics material. The elements 26 and 27 are provided with walls and recesses suitable for constituting the casings for the parts of the ventilation system of the vehicle of which the body 1 forms part. Further, the element 27 can constitute the dashboard of the said vehicle.A similar assembly of elements is described in a previous application by the Applicant entitled assembly of elements serving as a separation between the passenger compartment and the engine compartment of a motor vehicle , filed 20th May, 1980. The body 1 is produced starting from the structure 2 and a plurality of different plastics material elements in dependemeon the different functions which they must fulfil, by a process illustrated schematically in Figure 1 in which the rectangles represent working stations in the bodywork production lines, at which the operations of the process are performed, and the lines represent the streams of elements transported by suitable conveyors.With reference to Figure 1 the structure 2, which is made on a different, possibly automated, production line by means of known techniques involving spot welding robots, are supplied in a stream 28 to a first station 29 at which is performed a positioning operation in which the structure 1 is positioned on a platform equipped with suitable references and abutments, in such a way that the subsequent operations can be performed in an automatic manner.From the station 10 the stream 28 of structures 2, which are arranged transversely with respect to the direction of advance of the stream 28, is supplied to a station 30 at which the mounting of the separator assembly 25, by means of a manual and or an automatic operation is performed. A stream 31 of separator assemblies 25 arrives at the station 30, the separator assemblies 31 are preassembled at a side station 32 of a separate bodywork line. At the station 32 the elements 26 and 27 which are made of a moulded polyoxyphenylene resin NORIL possibly reinforced with a suitable filler for example glass fibres are fixed rigidly together by means of an adhesive substance which can join the two elements 26 and 27 rigidly together and is able to contribute to the rigidity of the assembly 25 and to seal the junction between the elements themselves.An adhesive substance having such characteristics will hereinafter be defined as a structural adhesive .Polyurethanes are particularly suitable structural adhesives, particularly those having thixotropic nondrip characteristics and a mean viscosity lying between 100,000 and 300,000 centipoise, which ensures a minimum immediate adherence between the parts which are secure together. Notwithstanding this the surfaces to be joined must be prepared by means of cleaning with organic solvents acetone or methylene chloride and rubbed down with emery cloth andZor by the application of adhesion promoters primers having synthetic bases for example an isocyanate base . Moreover after the parts have been brought together a critical time, of around 10 15 minutes must be allowed to pass, during which the assembly which is held together by adhesive must not be moved.Therefore, after the gluing stage there must be disposed an accumulation zone for at least 15 20 workpieces which can be possibly warmed to a low temperature around 800C to accelerate the hardening of the adhesive.The stream 28 of structures 2 is then supplied to a station 33 at which also arrives a flow 34 of front end pieces 3 which are integrally moulded of suitable plastics resin, for example ABS acrylonitrile butadienestyrene and a stream 35 of rear en4pieccs 4, which are assembled starting from different individual elements at a station 36 of a separate bodywork line. With reference to Figure 2, each rearen p Es 4 includes a generally cupshape element 37 having a substantially rectangular base 38 which delimits a baggage space, two sides or rear wings 39 and a bumper element 40. The element 37 is made by moulding a composite foamed material or of polycarbonate and rests on the frame element 18. The element 37 has a platform constituted by the base 38, two inner lateral sides 41 and a rear bottom wall 42.The bumper element 40 is made in one piece by moulding a suitable resin, for example ABS, and is fixed at the rear against the wall 42. The rear wings 39 are made by moulding in a polyester resin and are fixed laterally outside the inner sides 41. The elements 38, 39 and 40 are positioned and fixed together at the station 36 by adhesive and or by mechanical connection elements such as screws or rivets. If the elements 38, 39 and 40 are to be held together solely by adhesive then a polyurethane structural adhesive is used, which is applied by extrusion onto surfaces preliminarily prepared as previously mentioned, with adhesion promoters.To ensure an immediate fixing of the various elements, sufficient to perform all the necessary adhesive operations with relative security, points on the surfaces to be glued have a rapid acting adhesive applied to them suitable for ensuring an almost instantaneous connection.Once the gluing operations are terminated the assembly 4 is left for about 10 to 20 minutes and then it can be moved. To accelerate and simplify the assembly operations for the element 4 the elements 38, 39 and 40 can be fixed by means of screws housed in suitable seats 43, which ensure the structural connection between the various elements. In this case the element 37 is preferably made of a composite foam material SMC sheet moulding compound and seals, not illustrated, are interposed between the elements of the assembly 4. The junctions between the various elements are further sealed by means of elastic sealing adhesive substances which allow almost independent movements between the various elements, made from a polysulphide base for example thioprene .Such substances, hereinafter defined only as sealing adhesives include thixotropic liquid rubbers which can vulcanise at ambient temperature and have a mean viscosity of 470.000 centipoise, can ensure a minimum of immediate adhesion of the elements. Naturally it is possible to adopt a mixed fixing process, partly using structural adhesives and partly using screws and sealing adhesives. At the station 33 the endpieces 3 and 4 are fixed to the structure 2 by screwing. The station 33 is completely automatic and the endpieces 3 and 4 are supplied by means of conveyor belts provided with abutments and automatic positioners, which cooperate with the abutments of the platform on which the structure 2 is mounted.The screwing is performed by means of automatic selfaligning screwing devices controlled, for example, by suitable robots and acting in two phases, one for obtaining a preliminary fixing and one for obtaining a definitive fixing.Following this the stream 28 of structures 2, which have the aspect illustrated in Figure 4, is supplied to a station 44, to which there are also supplied streams 45 and 46 of bonnets 8 and tailgates 7 respectively, which are each made in one piece by moulding a foamed polyester resin and a polyester resin respectively, and are provided with hinges 47 and metal locks fixed by means of screws and or polyurethane structural adhesives. At the station 44 the bonnet 8 and the tailgate 7 are positioned on the structure 2 and the associated hinges are screwed to this latter by means of automatic screwing machines. The bonnets 8 are provided with air intakes 48 of polyester, which have been previously secured to them by adhesive using polyurethane structural adhesives.Then the structures 2 are sent on to subsequent stations 49 and 50 where mounting of the front and rear doors 5 and 6 respectively is performed. The doors 5 and 6 are preliminarily assembled on separate bodywork lines at two stations 51 and two stations 52 and are supplied to the respective stations 49 and 50 by means of side lines 53 and 54. The doors 5 and 6 are made at the stations 51 and 52 starting from pairs of moulded polyester resin panels which are disposed facing one another and glued together along the edges 23 by means of polyurethane structural adhesives. A metal crosspiece 55 Figure 4 is interposed between each pair of facing panels before gluing, the crosspiece 55 carrying a window winder device, not illustrated, and hinges 56 for the doors 5 and 6 screwed thereto as well as lock devices for the doors themselves.The crosspieces 55 are fixed mechanically to one of the panels by means of connection members. As an alternative to gluing, the facing panels of each door 5 and 6 can be fixed together by means of microwave welding by interposing between them a special synthetic film and then making the assembled door pass through a microwave oven. When adhesives are used the surfaces to be joined must be prepared as previously described.Since the structures 2 advance transversely, a rotation of each structure 2 to dispose it parallel to the sense of advancement is required in order to mount the doors 5 and 6. This rotation is effected at the station 49, whilst at a subsequent station 57 the structures 1, which appear as illustrated in Figure 5, are again rotated transversely to the direction of advance. Two streams 58 of front wings 9 arrive at the station 57, these front wings are moulded in one piece from a polyester resin and are fixed to the structure 2 by screwing to the longerons 19.At this point the bodies 1 are almost complete, needing only the roof panel 10 which is moulded in one piece from a foam polyester resin or from a composite material reinforced with a filler of mineral fibres SMC and which is fixed directly to an edge 59 of the structure 2 delimiting an upper opening 60 thereof, by means of gluing with polysulphide sealing adhesives.From the station 57 the stream 28 of partially clad structures 2 is supplied to a station 61 where there is deposited on the edge 59, by extrusion, first a continuous bead of an adhesion promoter primer and then a continuous bead of a polysulphide based sealing adhesive. Then there is applied, to points on the edge 59, a rapid acting adhesive 1 5 minutes required for hardening at those points of the perimeter of the opening 60 which are most greatly stressed. Finally the structures 2 are supplied to a station 62 where a stream 63 of roof panels 10 having a perimetral seal 64 Figure 4 arrives. Following this, at the station 62, the roof panels 10 are positioned onto the structure 2 and one of their surfaces 65 is positioned in contact, with a predetermined pressure, against the bead of sealing adhesive. The points of radpid acting adhesive ensure the temporary fixing, whilst the sealing adhesive cross links cold ensuring a satisfactory fixing of the roof panel 10 in a time lying between several tens of minutes and several hours. From the station 62 a stream 66 of bodies 1 leaves, which can then be subjected to a baking step at a relatively low predetermined temperature 800C to accelerate the hardening of the adhesive.During all the operations described, moreover, the junctions between the various elements are sealed by means of a sealing adhesive.The stations 61 and 62 are schematically illustrated inFigure 6. The adhesives and the adhesion promoters are applied by means of a nozzle 67 mounted on an articulated arm 68 which is movable along the perimeter of the open ing 60. The adhesives used are all of the two component type which can polymerise and harden at ambient temperature cold hardening . With suitable means the adhesives, which are mixed by the nozzle 67, can be maintained in the fluid state for several hours so that even in the case of closure of the system they do not harden within the distributor nozzle. The station 62 is provided with an arm 69 which withdraws the roof panels 10 and positions them on a conveyor 70, and arms 71 and 72 which withdraw each roof panel 10 from the conveyor 70 and mount it on the structure 2 pressing it against this structure with a predetermined pressure.The roof panel 10 Figure 7 is provided with a small channel 73 for containing the adhesive and an outer channel 74 for preventing this from escaping to the outside. Further the structures 2 are provided with reference pins 75 for exactly positioning the roof panel 10. The seal 64 ensures a water tight and dust tight seal in every case. From what has been described the advantages of the present invention will be apparent. It allows a relatively light vehicle to be constructed thanks to the plastics cladding, but the vehicle has a metal support structure capable of absorbing the energy of impacts.Moreover it allows the outer cladding to be made of relatively small elements which can easily and rapidly be moulded, and which are easily and simply assembled and dismantled, thereby simplifying both the construction and possible repair of the bodywork of the vehicle.The application of sealing adhesives on the elements mounted mechanically allows the structure to be reinforced whilst at the same time avoiding the infiltration of water and or dust and the assembly of several elements on separate bodywork lines allows a simpler and more rapid working.
