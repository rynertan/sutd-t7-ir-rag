# Improvements in and relating to vehicle speed control systems.

## Abstract
A vehicle speed control system is disclosed in which a signal Vs representing actual vehicle speed is, when the vehicle is running at a desired speed, mementarily fed into, and then stored in, a memory 36 . The memory therefore produces a signal Vm representing desired speed. An error amplifier 42 compares the signal Vm with a signal Vf which represents actual vehicle speed and which is derived from Vs via a filter 38 . Any speed error causes a drive circuit 46 to adjust the throttle 15 of the vehicle engine 10 so as to tend to correct the vehicle speed error. The vehicle speed dependent signal Vf is derived from the actual speed of the engine 10 of the vehicle, and this signal is also fed to a comparator 50 which compares it with a reference signal Vr representing an upper or lower limit for engine speed. When the comparison indicates that the engine speed has exceeded the level represented by the reference Vr e.g. when the vehicle transmission is inadvertently disconnected , a control unit 56 switches off the vehicle speed control system. If Vf is derived not from the actual speed of the engine of the vehicle but from its road speed, then a separate circuit producing an actual engine speed signal, for comparison with the engine speed limit signal Vr, may be used.
