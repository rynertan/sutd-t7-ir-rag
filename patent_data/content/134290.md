## Description
CONSTANT RELEASE RATE SOLID DOSAGE TH EOPHYLL INE FORMULATION The present invention relates to an improved pharmaceutical formulation for theophylline and more particulary to a solid dosage, constant release rate theophylline formulation. Theophylline and its salts and derivatives are sold in varying dosage forms for symptomatic treatment of bronchial asthma and reversible bronchospasm which may occur in association with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other obstructive bronchial diseases. The drug relieves the primary symptoms of asthma, including the shortness of breath, wheezing and dyspnea improves pulmonary function as measured by increased flow rates dnd vital capacity. There are a number of commercially available forms of the widely used drug, i.e. Elixophyllin Cooper , Somophyllin Fisons , Theodur Key , Theolaireo Riker and Theophyl Knoll , to name a few.In addition, there are numerous combination products containing, for example, theophylline, ephedrine hydrochloride and phenobarbital Tedral sold by MeadJohnson , theophylline, ephedrine sulfate, pheonbarbital and guaifenesin Bronkotabs , Bronkolixir Breon , theophylline, calcium salicilate and potassium iodide Theokinb sold by Knoll , etc. Conventional theophylline preparations generally have to be taken every four to six hours.Because of the problems encountered with patient compliance when medicine administered on a chronic basis has to be taken frequently, attention has been directed to the formulation of longer acting theophylline preparations. One of the most successful sustained release theophylline preparations has been the preparation sold by Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc. under the trademark Theodur. The present invention provides a constant release rate theophyllilne formulation which is administered once or twice a day to provide prophylactic treatment of bronchial asthma. The present invention provides a constant release rate theophylline tablet which may be administered once or twice daily to control the symptoms of bronchial asthma and other chronic respiratory disease. The constant release rate tablet contains a therapeutically effective amount of theophylline admixed with a slowdissolving, water insoluble cellulose derivative and a tablet excipient. Coloring agents or dyes as well as other bulking agents and a tablet lubricant can also be included. The constant release rate theophylline tablet of the present invention comprises an intimate admixture of a therapeutically effective amount of theophylline, from about 4.5 to 12.7, and preferably 5.1 to 10.3 weight percent of a slow dissolving, water insoluble cellulose derivative, such as cellulose acetate phthalate, ethyl cellulose and the like, and from 35 to 75 weight percent of a bulking excipient. In addition, the tablet may include a coloring agent or dye, lubricants and the like. Preferably, each tablet contains from 100 350 mg of theophylline. The preferred slow dissolving water insoluble cellulose derivatives are cellulose acetate phthalate and ethyl cellulose alone, or in combination with each other.Other such derivatives are well known in the art and include methyl cellulose, powdered cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, microcrystallline cellulose and the like. Dibasic calcium phosphate is the preferred bulking excipient. The term constant release rate, as used herein, refers to a formulation wherein the in vitro release of theophylline from the tablet, using a U.S.P.dissolution apparatus, pH 7.5, is constant and linear against time until all of the drug is released when plotted on an x,y graplh using the formula dc R dt wherein K constant, dc decreasing concentration and dt decreasing time, a straight line is formed.Calculation of the data points by linear regression analysis should give a value of 0.85 to 1.0. A value of 1.0 is a perfect straight line. The preparation of the theophylline tablets of the present invention is simple, straight forward and results in a significant savings in production costs, and hence costs to the patient, over presently available capsule formulations. Generally speaking, constant release rate theophylline tablets are advantageously prepared by dissolving the slow dissolving, water insoluble cellulose derivative in a suitable solvent and carefully admixing the solution with a dry blended powder of theophylline, and excipient to form a wet granulation. The granulation is dried, screened through a 14 20 mesh screen, and the sized granules are then compressed in a rotary or single station punch press. For ease of tableting, it is preferred to add a lubricant such as magnesium stearate to the dried granules prior to tabletting. The preferred solvent is a l llv v mixture of isopropyl alcohol and methylene chloride. Other suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, lower aliphatic alcohols such as methanol,n propanol, ethanol, denatured alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl acetate and non chlorinated hydrocarbons. Turning to the preferred process of the present invention, the cellulose derivative, preferably cellulose acetate phthalate, is dissolved and dispersed in a solvent, preferably isopropyl alcohol methylene chloride 1 1 v v , which is used to make a wet granulation. The amount of cellulose derivative may range from 4.5 12.7 weight percent of the final tablet weight, and preferably from 5 10.3 weight percent. Generally from about 60 to 20 weight percent of solvent, based on the total weight of the formulation, and preferably from about 50 to 35 weight percent is employed. The cellulose derivative and solvent are blended until the cellulose derivative is completely dispersed and clarity of solution has been obtained. Generally, it takes between 35 40 minutes per 125 liters of fluid, using a lightening blender, to effects solution. The granulating fluid is then added to dry blended U.S.P. anhydrous theophyllilne, 16 200 mesh and preferably 40 80 mesh, and a bulking agent, in a slow, steady stream, preferably at a rate no faster than 3 minutes per liter of solution. If the fluid is added too rapidly, it is difficult to obtain an even granulation. Following the addition of the cellulose solution, blending is continued for from about 3 to 12 minutes, preferably 3.5 to 6 minutes per kilogram of material. It is critical that the wet granulation be completely dried before screening. Failure to observe this technique may result in rupture of the granules and a loss of the constant release rate profile. In conventional prior art tableting procedures, the wet granulations are generally screened immediately after formation and then dried. However, if the prior art processes are employed, the constant release rate profile of the theophylline tablets of the present invention may be destroyed. It is preferable to maintain the humidity below 50 both during the granulating and tableting processes. Because of the unique and superior constant release rate properties, theophylline tablets made by the described process and ingredients can be administered once or possibly twice a day to provide 24 hour suppression of wheezing, bronchospasm and dyspnea. Example 1 Theophylline tablets weighing 665 mg and containing 300 mg of theophylline were prepared from the following formulation and by the following process. Inaredient Amount Theophyllilne, anhydrous 300 gm Dibasic Calcium Phosphate 300 gm Cellulose Acetate Phthalate 30 gm Ethyl Cellulose 30 gm Isopropyl Alcohol 150 ml Methylene Chloride 150 ml Magnesium Stearate 4.6 gm The theophyllilne and dibasic calcium phosphate were dry blended in a Hobart mixer. The dissolved cellulose acetate phthalate was slowly added until a wet granulation was formed. The material was discharged onto paper lined trays and dried overnight. The granules were then screened through a number 16 screen and blended with magnesium stearate. The granulate was then compressed into tablets using a rotary press. Each tablet weighed 665 mg and contained 300 mg of theophylline with a tablet hardness of 10 kp. Example 2 To demonstrate that the product does not have a tendency to dissolve in the stomach the following disintegration test was done using tablets made fromExample 1.

In a neutral pH which is found beyond the stomach in the small intestine a slow, steady erosion of the tablet system is noted. Example 3 While the tablets showed a steady constant erosion, to be considered a true constant release rate formulation requires testing by dissolution. Tablets made by Example 1 were placed in an approved U.S.P. dissolution apparatus and assayed for theophylline content. Twenty tablets were randomly weighed and the average tablet weight was 663 mg.The amount of theophylline per tablet was reported as 290.4 mg. Dissolution was carried out using U.S.P. apparatus II, pH 7.5 150 RPM at 37 C.

This data demonstrates that tablets made from the present formulation have a constant release rate profile and have little disintegration or tablet disruption in gastric acid. Example 4 A single dose bioavailability study was performed in two healthy male volunteers weighing 80 and 72.2 kg, respectively. After a complete medical evaluation, the two subjects were given a single oral dose 300 mg, tablet of example 1 of theophylline formulated as described inExample 1. The subjects ingested the theophylline tablets with 250 ml of water and blood samples were drawn at the time indicated. Plasma theophylline was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography. The results of this analysis at the specified time intervals are shown below in Table 3.

These figures can be compared to a similar dose of regular theophylline which has a published excretion half life of 9.0 2.1 hoursl. It would appear that theophylline prepared by the presentinvention has a plasma dwell time which is approximately two times greater than theophylline prepared in the usual manner.
