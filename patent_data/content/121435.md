# Silver halide photographic materials.

## Abstract
Silver halide photographic materials with higher sensitiv ity and less fogging having at least one silver halide emulsion layer over a photographic base or support wherein emulsion of said emulsion layer substantially contains core shell type silver halide grains or core shell type monodisperse silver halide grains, core portion of said grain containing silver iodide in a greater amount than that contained in shell portion of said grain and said emulsion is subjected to chemical ripen ing in the presence of a labile selenium compound, optionally with coexistance of a silver halide solvent, and said emulsion may contain further a specific phenol compound.
