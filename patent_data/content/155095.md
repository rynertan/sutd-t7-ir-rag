# A tool head assembly.

## Abstract
A tool head assembly 1 for use in preparing a tube for welding includes a centre pilot 2 which is rotatable. The centre pilot 2 is adapted to enter a bore of a tube 10 to centre the tool head assembly 1 by being provided with rotatable means 28 which rotate around the internal surface of the bore of the tube 10 . The rotatable means 28 are also adjustable to a required operative diameter thereby enabling the centre pilot 2 to enter the bores of a batch of tubes having a range of internal bores. The rotatable centre pilot 2 is connectable to a support 4 which is mountable in a machine tool. The support 4 carries at least one cutting tool 6, 8 . In use the centre pilot 2 is adjusted to the required operative diameter and the rotating centre pilot 2 entered into the bore of the tube 10 which is clamped externally to facilitate rotation of the rotatable means 28 around the bore of the tube 10 to centre the tool assembly 1 thereby enabling cutting of the surface of the tube 10 into a pre determined shape to be effected by the at least one cutting tool 6, 8 to prepare the tube 10 for welding.
