# A method of making a pin member for electrical connectors.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a pin member 1 for electrical connectors of the pin and socket type, obtained by perma nent deformation, according to a predetermined angle, of a cylindrical hollow body of a suitable metal, provided with through slots 4 in the cylindrical surface thereof at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of said cylindrical body. The twisting action is directed in the opposite direction to the inclination of the slots 4 , so as to cause an outward expansion or bulging of the strips defined 8 by said slots and, therefore, an increase of the outer diameter of the hollow cylindrical body at the intermediate portion thereof.
