# Apparatus and process for separating a dispersed liquid phase from a continuous liquid phase by electrostatic coalescence.

## Abstract
Apparatus for separating a dispersed liquid phase from a continuous liquid phase by electrostatic coalescence compris ing an elongated vessel 1 with an inlet conduit 2 , a first com partment 5 , a second compartment 6 and outlet conduits 3, 4 , the compartments 5, 6 being in fluid communication with one another and being each provided with a plurality of sub stantially parallel cylindrical cathodic elements 12 arranged in the main flow direction, and a plurality of rod like anodic el ements 13 , each anodic element 13 being substantially con centrically arranged inside a cathodic element 12 , wherein cathodic elements of an up stream compartment have cross sectional areas being substantially larger than cross sectional areas of cathodic elements 12 of a down stream compart ment.
