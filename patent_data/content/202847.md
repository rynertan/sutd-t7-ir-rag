# System and method for Scheduling irrigation.

## Abstract
The system and method for scheduling irrigation of an agricultural area in which a crop is being grown, are primarily based on the measurement of actual plant responses to soil water deficits for efficient and effective irrigation. The system and method are characterized by plural sensors 10 for sensing a plurality of parameters related to the agricultural area, including crop canopy temperature 13 from which the water stress condition of the crop can be determined, and for generating sensor data respectively representative of the sensed parameters an electronic device 12 operatively connected to the sensors 10 for controllably receiving the sensor data from the sensors and deriving therefrom irrigation instructions dependent at least in part on a determination from such data of the actual water stress condition of the crop and an output device 12 operatively connected to the electronic device for outputting the irrigation instructions for controlling irrigation of the agricultural area in accordance therewith. The system is embodied in a portable unit 24 which greatly facilitates the collection of data and provides immediate anaylsis of such data and instructions to irrigate when needed.
