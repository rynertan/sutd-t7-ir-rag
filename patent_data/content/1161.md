# A system for protection of an installation on the floor of a body of water and a method of using it.

## Abstract
A system for protection of an installation on the floor of a body of water from damage due to erosion, dragging ships anchors and fishing gear. A flexible mat covering the installation prevents underscouring of the installation. The edges of the mat resting on the floor are so thick and rigid that a dragging anchor or fishing gear hooking the edge will be carried over the installation by the roll of mat formed by the anchor or fishing gear. Elasticity of the mat and or its edge causes the mat to roll back to resume its original configuration after the passage of the anchor or fishing gear.

## Description
A SYSTEM FOR PROTECTION OF AN INSTALLATION ON THE FLOOR OF A BODY OF WATER AND A METHOD OF USING ITThe invention relates to a system for protection frcm damage due to scour, ships anchors, fishing gear, etc., of a pipeline, cable, foundation or other installation on the floor of a body of water.Various devices for protection against the eroding effect of watts and currents,only, exist. An alternative system protecting against erosion, anchors and fishing gear depends on hoking anchors being carried over tIie installation by movable plate like members which slide and or turn over top of the installation. Such platelike nenbers have to be strong enough to carry the weight of the hooking anchor.The principle of functioning of the present system as defined in Claim 1 implies that the hooking anchor winds or folds the protective mat together and is carried over the installation by the rolled or folded mat. The rcquired strength of the individual member of the system and thereby the cc,st of fabrication is minimized. Furthentore, the present system is easter to install.For simplification the following descripticn will refer to protection of a submarine pipeline as a typical example. It is obvious that the system, or at least its side portions, can be used for protection of any submarine installation. In the description reference will be made to the drawing, in whichFig. 1 is a cross section of a pipeline 1 protected by a mat the side portions of which slope all the way fran center portion to edges,Fig. 2 is a cross section of a pipeline where the innermost portion of each side portion of the protective mat slopes, whereas the outermost portion rests on and follows the contour of the floor,Fig. 3 is a cross section of a pipeline where the center portion of the protective mat embraces the pipeline, whereas the side portions rest on the floor, Fig. 4 is a cross section of a pipeline protected by a mat consisting of two layers of sheet material forming a bag filled with sediment or other fill material,Fig. 5 shzus the sane as Fig. 4, but the bag is here supplemented with horizontal portions of mat of blocks,Fig. 6 is a longitudinal side view of a tube forming the edge of the mat,Fig. 7 is a cross section taken along the line I I in Fig. 6,Figs. 8 10 are alternative cross sections perpendicular to the pipeline of a mat of sheet material, with longitudinally extending notches in its upper surface, channels in its upper half, and slits in its underside, respectively,Figs. 11 16 are cross sections perpendicular to the pipeline of alternative shapes and interoonnections of blocks forming the protective mat,Figs. 17 and 18 are alternative longitudinal sections along the line IIII in Fig. 16 and show two alternative couplings in the joints between blocks forming a mat,Fig. 19 is a plan view of a mat consisting of ball shaped blocks,Fig. 20 is a plan view of a mat consisting of double cone shaped blocks,Fig. 21 is a cross section along the line II III of Fig. 19 or IV lV of Fig. 20,Fig. 22 is a cross section perpendicular to the pipeline of a preferred entcdimnt of the invention,Fig. 23 is a cross section perpendicular to the pipeline of a mat consisting of scrapped tyres,Fig. 24 is a cross section of a mat wound into parallel rolls resting on the pipeline,Fig. 25 is a side view of an arrangement for laying the mat,Fig. 26 is a cross section along the line V V in Fig. 25.Depending on weight distribution in the mat, and sediment transport conditions at the installation site, the protective mat in principle may assume the three different canfigurations shown in Figs. 1 3., The configurations shown in Figs. 1 2 are favourable in areas with sedi rtent transport. If the sloping portions of the mat 16 are irtrmeable enough to conduct the current over top of the pipeline 1, a deposition of sediment 8 will take place underneath and on top of the mat, Figs.1,2,3. The roll of mat 9 folded by a hooking anchor 10, Fig. 22, therefore will roll upwards on top of the deposition. Furtherrtore, the sediment on top of the mat will increase the diameter of the roll 9. For both reasons a smaller width of the mat is needed to obtain a certain roll diameter in sea bottom areas with sediment transport than in areas without such transport.If the mat is not anchored in the bottom, the configuration shown in Fig.1 requires that the edge portions of the mat are ituch heavier than the sloping portions.In areas without sediment transport, designs of the mat as shown in Figs.4 and 5 are appropriate. The weight of the fill material 39 in the bag 38 may also be desirable, if the protective system also is to substitute the weight coating of a pipeline.The design of the mat may be based on 4 different provisions a In particular in areas without sediment transport,the width and thi ness of the mat are so large that the diameter of the rolled or folded mat formed by the largest anchor hoofing the edge, before passage of the pipeline,has gained enough to make the anchor slip over the roll of mat, ard the elasticity anchor the weight of the mat will make this roll back to its original position.b In particular in areas with sediment transport, the width and thickness of the mat are large enough to make the anchor slip over the roll of mat before it arrives at the opposite edge of the mat.c In particular in areas with sediment transport, the strength of the mat in its longitudinal direction may be so low that the roll of mat breaks when the anchor has passed over the pipeline, so that the anchor can stove on, without passing over the roll of mat.d In particular in areas with sediment transport, the mat may be sectioned into shorter, overlapping lengths along the pipeline. After having passed over the pipeline, the anchor will take a section of mat away.A hooking anchor s initiation of a rolling displacement of the edge of mat depends on a certain rigidity of the edge. Ihe horizontal drag of a hoking anchor or fishing gear should be spread over a certain length of mat. Otherwise the anchor will wedge into the edge of the mat. Furthermor,e, the geometrical and frictional resistance should be so little, that a positive rotational mment as to the lower side of the edge results.To prevent the edge fran getting caught in. the corner between shaft and flukes of the anchor, the edge should also have a certain minimum thickness.These requirgts may be fulfilled by bending the edge around, either up wards, Fig.2, or Vwards, Fig.3, or all the way round to form a closed tube, Fig.l. Alternatively, a separate tube 4 may be attached to the edge,Figs. 5 7 and 22. The tube may be filled with for instance sedirrent, or balls of concrete, or one or store longitudinally extending stays.The tube must have a certain flexibilitv and elongability to fulfill its purpose.To carry the weight of at least the draggsna anchor chain,it must at the same tim have a certain radial strength.One solution to these requirements is a tube made of neoprene reinforced with at least one spiral shaped wire fabricated forinstanoe of steel,Figs. 6 7. To provide bearing capacity, one of the spirals, 40, may have a low pitch. To provide rigidness, another spiral, 41, may have a higher pitch. Both spirals allow for prolongation of the tube in case an anchor hooks it. Lcngitudinal members, e.g. the spiral 41,may project above the surface of the tube, to provide a foothold for the anchor chain, so that it can rotate the tube.If the tube 4 consists of rigid material, e.g. concrete, steel, alumunium anchor plastic, the tube may be sectioned to obtain flexibility and elongability. The joints between adjacent sections may be telescopic to provide continuity.The tube may be perforated so as to minimize the hydraulic resistance and to become filled by the natural sediment transport. It may even consist of oppositely spiraled wires forming mesh of for instance steel coated with plastic, neoprene or the like.To spread the horizontal drag force over a length of the matJ the mat may contain one or more longitudinally extending parallel stays, solid or hollow, at least along the edges of the mat. Although rigidness of the edge portion is required to prevent a hooking anchor fran wedging into the edge, the formation of a roll of mat implies a certain longitudinal prolongability of the mat, at least of its edge portions. Fram the edge towards the pipeline the prolongability may gradually decrease. If the mat contains stays made of unelastic material, they may be sectioned and staggered in channels in the mat, so that elongation of the sheet is not prevented by the stays. The length of the sectioning may gradually decrease toward the edges of the mat.To increase the ability of the mat to roll back to its original position, after a hooking anchor has passed over it, the mat in its longitudinal and or transverse directions may be made of elastic material.A decrease of the elasticity tard the pipeline may be 6ta.ned by vary ing the elasticity and or kind of material and or thicnnes of the mat, either oontinucusly fran edge to centerline or by way of abrupt changes of these proporties. To minimize the lifting forces of the current, the mat may contain perforations and or Openings of various shapes and sizes to neutralize the difference of hydraulic pressures between the two sides of the mat. The holes should be located and or shaped so that anchors and fishing gear will not catch hold of then. In areas with sediment transport the sloping portions of the mat should be tight enough to conduct the current over top of the pipeline.The mat may be made of many different kinds of material. In the following, 4 different groups of structures will be mentioned 1 Mats consisting of at least one layer of sheet material 2 Mats of blocks bonded together by sheet, net and or ties 3 Conbinations of 1 and 2 4 Mats of scrapped tyres.re 1 The sheet may be elastic, and made of for example neoprene or natural rubber, and or plastic, e.g. polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, etc., or made of natural fibres, i.e. sisal, hemp, etc.To increase the weight of the mat, it may be built up as a sandwich structure including for instance water absorbent rubber or plastic foam, or composed of amixture of suitable fill material, e.g. sand, and rubber, plastic, bitumen or the like. To increase the strength, the sheet may be reinforced with for instance steel, nylon or other plastic, in at least one direction.A sheet that has too little weight to be stable has to be anchored in the seabed, or fastened to the pipeline, either by rreans of the pinching effect of the embracing portion of the sheet itself, cf. Fig.3, or by means of clamps. Or the mat may be weighted by naturally Figs. 1 3 or artificially supplied sediment. In the latter case the sediment may be enclosed in the space between two layers of sheet forming a closed bag 38, Figs.4 and 5, which may be divided into catartzrents by transversely and or longitudinally extending secondary walls. Alternatively, the bag may be filled with for instance balls or longitudinally extending rolls or pipes of concrete or plastic, of foemorubber or plastic, or other fill material. Transversely and or longitudinally extending,horizontal and or oblique stays, e.g. positioned as 42 or 43 in Fig.4, may further the function of the mat. if the bag 38 oonsists of for instance nylon reinforoed 4 X flukes of an anchor having reached somewhere underneath the bag 38, will easily slip over the bag because of the loose fill material and the smooth underside of the bag.To further the tendency of a sheet to fold asa roll in case of an andlor hooking its edge, the sheet appropriately is structured as shown in Figs.8, 9 and or 10. The longitudinally extending notches 44, slits 45 and or channels 46 all ease the upward concaving of the sheet.In stead of arranging 44, 45 or 46 in the sheet itself, they may be placed in possible transversely extending thickened pelts of the sheet, or in separate beams of a different material.A sheet divided in longitudinally extending bandsWof relatively rigid material connected by flexible material will tend to fold like an accordion. The tendency may be enhanced by placing the ccnnectionsB31ternately at the upper and lower surfaces of the rigid bands, Fig. 14.re 2 The preferred material for fabrication of blocks is concrete. But also other materials may be used. To facilitate laying of a mat of blocks, the weight may be reduced by use of light weight concrete, or even a spe cial water permeable concrete containing cavities or pores that will fill with water after the laying. To delay such absorption of water, the blocks may be coated with sate soluble material, e.g. cellulose The individual block may be shaped for instance as a cube, a box 22, Fig.12, a parallelepiped 19, Figs.13, 14, a trapezoid 20, Fig.ll, a ball 18, Figs.19, 21, a roll 2, Figs.16 18, 22, a double cone 21, Figs.20, 21, an ellipsoid,or other shape.Elongate blocks are placed parallel with the edge of the mat, and preferably with staggered ends.The blocks being placed close together, the upper edges parallel with the pipeline of box shaped blocks 22 may be cut off as shown in Fig.12. The edge portion of the mat forming the center of the roll formed by a hooking anchor, the angle DL, Figs. 11 and 12, between neighbouring blocks may gradually decrease from a maximum at the edge to a minimum at the center line of the mat. If the strength of the mat allows therefore,, may be so small that the roll of mat becomes tube formed, with a larger diameter than that of the corresponding solid roll. If the upper surface of a block is not covered by a sheet, the upper part of the block preferably should be rounded, Figs.16 22, to prevent the anr chor flukes fran catching hold. Tb make up a quite even outer surface of the roll of mat, the underside 23, Fig.ll, of the blocks may be rounded. The radius of the circular underside should gradually decrease toward the edges of the mat.The blocks may be interconnected by one or two sheets 25, by a net 29, and or by ties 5 and 6, fastened to the blocks at their upper or lower surfaces and or at a level somewhere between these surfaces. To prevent upward convexity of the mat, in particular along its edges, the connecting members between the blocks 22, Fig.12, or 24, Fig.22, depending on their shape may be placed above their underside Fig.12 or above. their centerline Fig.22 . The connecting material in one and or the other direction of the mat may be elastic and consist of for instance neoprene or natural rubber and or be plastic and consist of for instance polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon or natural fibre material. Fig.15 shews a mat consisting of ball or roll shaped blocks enclosed between two layers of sheet 25 of for instance neoprene or plastic, which may be interconnected by longitudinal walls 26. The upper layer of sheet may be reinforced or fortified in direction perpendicular to the pipeline.The lower layer may be un reinforced and made of for instance neoprene that can elongate in both directions. Besides the balls or cylinders, the space between the two layers may be filled with smaller balls or cylinders or some kind of fill material, e.g., sand. Appropriately the diame ters of the balls or cylinders gradually decrease boward the edges of the gnat, to ease the formation of a roll of mat, if an anchor hooks the edge.Ball Fig.l9 , dooble cone Fig.20 , or ellipsoid shaped blocks for maximm diameter of a roll of a hooked portion of mat, at a minirmn,vo ltite of block material, may be interconnected by means of a flexible casing 27 or 28 enclosing the blocks. The diagonally Figs.l9 and 20 or rectangular shaped casing may be made of flexible materials such as plastic, neoprene, etc., and or flexibly connected rigid materials such as plastic, neoprene, concrete, aluminium, etc. In one or the other direction the casing may be elastic so as to allow for insertion of the blocks 18 or 21 into the catpartttents of the casing, and for elongation of the mat in case an anchor hooks its edge.Without other means than the casing 27 or 28 to hold the blocks, these may be pressed out of their ccmçartments and act as rollers in case an anchor hooks the mat. In addition to the casing, the blocks may be interconnected by transverse and or longitudinal ties, which may be elastic. The ties may be attached to the surface of the blocks or pass through channels in these. To ensure a continuous, even surface of a mat of roll shaped loaisl 2, Figs.16 18 and 22, even on a nagged seafloor, the joints between adjacent blocks may be spherical, so that one end of the individual block is formed as a concave half sphere, the other end as a convex half sphere fitting into the concave end of the adjacent block.Appropriately the joints are provided with couplings. These may be doubleconvex Fig.17 , plane Fig.18 or dcuble concave. Each transversely extending line of disk shaped couplings Fig.l8 may be formed as one continuous plate made of flexible material, e.g. neoprene or polypropylene.The outer pfzriphery of each disk follows the contour of the roll 2, and the disk includes a channel 7 for the tie 5. Alternatively, at least part of each transverse line of couplings, in particular at either edge of the mat, may be divided in shorter sections overlapping eachother. If each section couples only two adjacent blocks, it may be made of rigid material, e.g. plastic or metal.To protect the ropes 5 frar damage and or to prevent too large mutual vertical displacement between adjacent blocks, each joint may contain a lan gitudinally extending tube 31, Fig.18, of resistable material enclosing the rope 5. The tube may be continuous over the total length of the rope or be sectioned on either side of each joint, or may form part of the block 2. At least the peripheral part of the tie 5 may be reinforced with resistable material. Ball shaped couplings 3 provide continuity of the surface of a mat of rollshaped blocks, even if the seabed is uneven, Fig.18. The couplings 3 are in transverse direction connected by continuous tie means 6 cast into or passing through channels in the couplings. In the longitudinal direction they are connected by the tie means 5 passing through channels 7 in the blocks and couplings. Suitable materials for fabrication of the ties 5 and 6 are for instance neoprene, natural rubber, polypropylene, aromatic polyamide coated with a harder wearing material, and or nylon or other materials. The elasticity of 5 and or 6 may increase more or less gradu ally toward the edges of the mat.The distance between neighbouring couplings and thereby the rolls 2, and or the diameter of the rolls, may vary over the width of the mat. To ease the formation of a roll of a booked portion of mat, this distance may gradually increase, and the diameter of 2 and 3 decrease, toward the edges of the mat. In order to tighten the mat, so that it can conduct the water current over top of the pipeline, Fig.22, the said distance appropriately is nil in the two sloping portions of the mat. These two portions may also betightened by puttying the spaces between adjacent nt rolls 2 2 wi t6 appropriate kind of plastic substance. Alternatively, a tight flexible sheet made of for instance neoprene may be attached to one or the other side of the mat of concrete blocks, which in these sloping portions of the mat may be cylindric or have other shape.If blocks within the two portions are not needed to obtain a sufficiently large diameter of roll of a hooked portion of mat, the said two portions may also consist of water tight sheet made of for instance neoprene, only.re 3 Fig. 5 shows one example of a catbination of 1 and 2 The center portion 38 of the mat may consist of two layers of shdet material forming a bag filled with for example sedimentary material. The horizontal edge portions may consist of mats of blocks.In another example mentioned above the sloping portions of the mat consist of a single layer of impermeable sheet material, and rest of the mat is made up of interconnected blocks.re 4 To obtain a cheap mat and at the same time solve an environmental and waste problem, the mat may be made of scrapped tyres tied together as shown in Fig.23. The orientation of the plane of the individual tyre may be vertical, oblique or horizontal to fill out the desired profile of the cover. One appropriate combination is shown in Fig. 23 where the underside of the sloping portions of the mat 33 are provided with a row of vertical tyres 34 on either side of the pipeline. Loose tyres may be placed underneath or on top of the mat 33.In areas with risk of dropped objects hitting the installation, e.g. a pipeline near an offshore platform, the impact of such collision may be alleviated by means of fenders, for instance the existing types of rubber fenders, or scrapped tyres, placed on top of the installation. The fenders may be placed underneath, e.g. in the form of a half tube of rubber embracing the upper part of the pipeline, and or on top of the protec tive mat, and or form part of this. In Fig.22 the rolls 11 may be made of rubber and possibly have larger diameters than the rolls 2. To minimize the friction between a hooking anchor and the mat, and to prevent anchors and fishing gear fran catching hold of the mat, either before or after having slipped over the roll of mat possibly formed, the lower and or the upper surface of the mat whether it consists of neor prene, concrete or other material and of the edge 4 may be lubricated with a water repellent grease. To even further reduce the friction between anchor and mat, the edge 4Figs.l 7,22, anchor the underside of the mat may be supplied with rollers 37, Fig.8. On a sheet type mat consisting of for instance neoprene, the rollers may for example consist of oontinuous, longitudinally extending rolls of neoprene or plastic, possibly reinforced, which are so weakly welded to the sheet, that they will be robbed off the sheet and function as rollers by a hooking anchor. On a block type mat the rollers ney sist of concrete rolls that are weakly tied to the mat.In a roll type of mat as shewn in Fig.22 the ties 5 and or 6 may be so elastic that they allow for the individual roll to leave its normal po sition between two couplings and function as roller between anchor roll of mat.Before the laying of a mat, it may be wound up from either edge to form two parallel longitudinal rolls, Fig.24. Compared with laying of an Un rolled mat, winding up before lowering it to the seabed has the advantages that the hydraulic resistance during lowering is minimized, and that the stability of elastic edge portians of the mat during the lowering will be improved, because the weight of edge portion in each roll will be transferred to the possibly less elastic longitudinal ties 5 at the center portion of the mat. From a lay barge the two rolls may be laid on top of the pipeline and rolled to both sides. On the layh the mat may be wound automatically by means of two vertical longitudinally extending edge frames with at least half circular cross section embracing the edges of the mat. The two frames converging downwards toward the seabed will make both side portions wind up toward the middle of the mat, to forum two parallel rolls close together. Correspondingly the unrolling of the rolls on the seabed may be achieved by means of a frame that in plan view is triangular. The foremast vertex of the frame trails on top of the mat on top of the pipeline same distance behind the surface vessel to which it is connected by a line. The two other vortexes of the triangular frame symmetrically positioned on either side of the pipeline move on the mat and like a sow plough spread the two rolls of mat away fran eachother and thereby unroll them.A mat of blocks in its full width may be wound around a large drumrfonmed reel 15, Figs.25 26, and be lowered continuously to the seabed, hanging fun the drum, which rotates floating on the surface or mounted on a surface vessel. To lay a rolled or unrolled mat symmetrically over the pipeline, a manned or um anned selfpropelled underwater vehicle that roll on wheels 13, Figs.25 26, or walk on feet or runners on the seabed is appropriate. The vehicle on its both sides should be supplied with upwardly extending frames and or the above type of device for unrolling the mat and trove along the pipeline ahead of the down coming mat.In a preferred third alternative laying method, one or two vehicles 12,Figs.25 26, interoonnected by transverse beams 14, of one of the above types of nanned or unnenned selfpropelled vehicles supplied with various sensor system to be controlled fran a surface vessel 17 through an unbi lical cable 18, move along both sides of the pipeline, carrying a large drumrfonmed reel 15 as described above. A long length of mat 16 is wound around the drum and will then be laid very accurately over the pipeline 1 as the vehicle s move forward.The vehicles may have capacity to carry at least two drums at a time, so that the shifting of the emptied drums with lorded drums from the surface vessel 17 can take place continuously without too long interruptions.To compensate for the variations of the load on the drum, accordingly as the mat 16 is wound off the drum, water may be let into the air filled drum. This balancing may be automatic. The volume of water in the drum may for example be regulated by the pressure exerted by the drum on its bearings. The pressure in the cylinder of a hydraulic pressure cell inserted between axle and bearing may be transmitted hydraulically to controll the valves regulating the content of water in the drum. The valves being kept open by spring means, until the transnitted pressure due to the increasing weight of the water let into the drum closes the valves at a certain preset critical pressure, the total weight of the drum will be kept constant. A fourth alternative method of installing the mat comprises sectioning the mat into shorter sections and lowering each section in rolled or unrolled state to the seabed, where the sections should overlap eachother. During the lowering, each section is hanging from a frame extending the length of the section.
