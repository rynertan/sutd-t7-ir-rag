# Method for constructing and reconstructing hologram.

## Abstract
A method for constructing and reconstructing a holo gram. The hologram is constructed by irriadiating two con struction beams 102, 103 having different incidence angles β , α onto a hologram record medium 101 and forming interference fringe patterns therein by the two construction beams. The hologram is reconstructed by irradiating a re construction beam 106 onto the interference fringe pat terns so as to diffract the reconstruction beam in accor dance with the interference fringe patterns. At least one of the two construction beams irradiates the hologram record medium through at least one optical deviation element 119 . The incidence angle, relative to the interference fringe patterns, of the reconstruction beam is different from that of each construction beam and arranged to be nearly a Bragg angle at any point of the hologram.
