# Impact printer with print hammer firing compensation circuit.

## Abstract
The circuit 30 detects variations in the nominal veloc ity of a character band 11 and adjusts the hammer 22 firing times to compensate for the variations. This circuit 30 measures deviations in band velocity that are either faster or slower than a nominal velocity during each charac ter emitter pulse and makes an appropriate correction in the subscan times that gate the hammer firing signals. A bi directional counter is counted up at a high frequency to a value representing the emitter period including the velocity deviation and then counted down after the error determina tion at a selected frequency that is a preselected fraction of the high frequency. This technique corrects for each charac ter emitter pulse and incorporates a timing proportionality to assure correct hammer impact.
