# Improved large area photovoltaic cell and method for producing same.

## Abstract
A large area photovoltaic cell tolerant of puncture damage to its small area segments and exhibiting only a proportional loss of electrical output from low resistance current paths formed through those small area segments. The small area segments are electrically connected in series in rows that are electrically connected in parallel. Columns of the small area segments are connected by bridges of semiconductor material simplifying manufacture. The lateral resistance of the semiconducting material electrically isolates the columns from each other. The large area cell also includes a pressurized sealant that is released when the cell is pierced. The sealant flows through the damaged portion and protects the edges of the puncture from degradation by ambient conditions.
