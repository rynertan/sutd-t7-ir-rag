## Description
Crop treating device The invention relates to a device for treating crop lying on the ground comprising at least one carrier rotatably driven about an upstanding shaft and having a plurality of upstanding stubs, about which one or more tines directed outwardly by a resilient element is are pivotable. In the known devices of the kind set forth in the preamble the tines together with the resilient elements are arranged on the carrier so as to be pivotable in a vertical plane, whilst the tines automatically swing outwardly owing to centrifugal force. Owing to the freedom of vertical movement of the tines the latter can work the ground through a more or less wide arc of a circle, when the upstanding shaft is set in a slanting position. The ground pressure of the tine is determined by the mass tending to swing outwards by the action of the centrifugal force. The invention has for its object to reduce said mass so that the ground pressure will be lower in order to avoid damage of the ground and the stubbles. The device embodying the invention is distinguished in that at least the lower tine on a standing pin is provided with means to establish a pivotable joint with the resilient element. In this embodiment it is now possible to impart to the resilient element a fixed working position relative to the carrier, only the tine itself maintaining the required freedom of vertical movement. Therefore, in the vertical plane, the co operating mass is limited to that of the pivotable tine. In one embodiment the pivot means are formed by a lying pivot pin held in a sleeve connected with the resilient element and being rotatable about the upstanding stub or in a holder supporting one or more tines. By using said sleeve the location of the lying pivot pin and the action of the resilient element can be adjusted to one another to the optimum. In order to maintain a given ground pressure the web of the or each tine or the prolongation thereof extends above the pivot pin, whilst the sleeve is provided with a stop. Because the stop is arranged on the sleeve the relative positions of stop and tine will not change in any working position, which ensures the desired ground pressure and reduces wear or damage of the tine.Preferably, the or each tine is fastened to the holder so as to be exchangeable. In a preferred embodiment the sleeve rotatable about the upstanding stub is formed by two or more parts standing one on the other and being non rotatably connected with one another, whilst a tine can be fastened to the upper parts. This structure not only ensures a ready exchangeability of the tines, which may be important in the event of damage, but also permits of manufacturing the upper tines together with the sleeve parts as a single unit from a synthetic resin, which reduces the cost price. In order to obtain various angular settings of the tines with respect to the carrier, the resilient element connected at one end to the sleeve is coupled by its other end with a body adapted to turn on the upstanding shaft with respect to the carrier so that the angle of the resilient element to the upstanding pin can be varied and hence also the angle of the tine to the standing pin. The rotatable body is preferably constructed in the form of a central ring with which all other ends of the resilient elements are connected. In this way a simultaneous central adjustment of all tines is obtained. According to the invention the upstanding stubs for the pivotable tines are arranged in two annular elements arranged one above the other and forming part of the carrier. The upper annular element may be constructed in the form of part of a closed hood, which ensures that the crop readily slides off the rotor and will not be retained and wound up. If the device is equipped with a skid on the lower side of the standing shaft, this skid is, in accordance with the invention, adjustable with respect to said shaft. In this way the optimal position of the tines relative to the ground and hence the correct ground pressure of the tines are obtained. In a preferred embodiment the dish is connected by means of a hinge with the upstanding shaft, the hinge shaft being located in front of the upstanding shaft viewed with respect to the direction of movement. This construction is advantageous in adjusting the height of the carrier with respect to the ground as well as in adjusting the angle between the upstanding shaft and the horizontal for moving the carrier with the pivotable tines fastened thereto into the correct position for a given job. In order to facilitate the maniability a locking member is provided for locking the adjused height of the foot with respect to the upstanding shaft near said shaft. The invention will be described more fully with reference to the following figures illustrating a few embodiments. Fig. 1 a standing sectional view of the device embodying the invention, Fig. 2 a perspective plan view of the carrier with the working tines of the device of fig. 1, Fig. 3 a perspective view of a detail of the suspension of the tines to the carrier, Fig. 4 an elevational view like fig. 3 of an alternative embodiment, Fig. 5 a detail view taken on the line IV IV in fig. 2, Fig. 6 a plan view of a second alternative embodiment of the suspension of the tines to the carrier, Fig. 7 a sectional view taken on the lineVII VII in fig. 6, Fig.8 a perspective plan view of the lower end of the upstanding shaft with the dished hood of the device of fig. 1 fastened to said shaft. The device shown in the figures mainly comprises a frame 1, which is hitched in any desired manner with an agricultural tractor and which is provided with two or more gear boxes 2. Each gear box accomodates a bevel gear transmission 3, the pinion of which is in engagement through a toothed shaft 4 with the power take off shaft of the agricultural tractor. The wheel of the bevel gear transmission 3 is connected with a carrier 6 adapted to rotate about an upstanding shaft 5 fixedly arranged in the gear box 2, said carrier being provided with tine like working members 7. The lower end of the standing shaft 5 is pivoted to a supporting foot 8, which slides along the ground in operation. The carrier 6 mainly comprises a lower, annular element 10, to which upstanding stubs 11 are fastened at equal intervals along the circumference. The top ends od the stubs 11 are fastened in a second, annular element 12, which is the circumferential flange of a closed cover 13. The lower, annular element 10 is connected through spokes 14 with a coupling flange 15, which is bolted to the lower bevel gear wheel of the transmission 3. From fig. 3 it will be apparent that a sleeve 13 is rotatably arranged on each stub 11, for example, by means of synthetic resin sliding bearings 17 on the top and bottom sides. The sleeve 16 comprises a thickened lower part 16 and an upper, slender part 16 non rotatably connected with the former through a cam joint 18. The lower part 16 has a hole directed transversely of the stub 11 for accomodating a lying stub shaft 19 and furthermore an uninterrupted hole on the outer side for receiving one end of a helical spring 20 arranged around the upper, slender part 16 . One end 21 of the helical spring 20 emerges from the sleeve 16 so as to form a stop, which will be described more fully hereinbelow. The lower tine 22 of the working members 7 consists of a flat strip of material, which is fastened on the inner side to the top side of a holder 23, which is slipped onto the lying shafts 19. By means of a guard clamp 24 the tine is coupled via the pin 19 wih the sleeve 16 and is capable of freely turning up and down in a vertical plane.The protuding part 21 of the helical spring 20 limits the downward movement of the tine 22 and thus determines the lowermost position of the tine 22. EOwing to the centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the carrier 6 and since the tine 22 is fastened to the top side of the holder 23 the tine 2 tends to tilt down to the pin 21. cm The slender upper part 16 is rigidly connected with the upper tine 25 of the working members 7 and preferably menufactured integrally with said slender part from a synthetic resin.As a matter of course, a plurality of sleeve parts 16 may be arranged in superposition, each part holding a tine. From the description of th oflstructiQ n it it will be apparent that the lowermost tine is capable of freely following the ground contour owing to its freedom of movement in a vertical sense. The upper tine or tines maintain their vertical positions.From fig. 2 it will be apparent that the tines 22 and 25 respectively are parallel to one another at their ends.The construction described permits of manufacturing the lowermost tine 22 from wear resistant, hard material, whereas the upper tines may be made from a synthetic resin. Fig. 4 shows an alternative embodiment in which corresponding parts are designated by the same reference numerals.The sleeve 16 rotatably holds the lying pivot pin 12. and is welded to a bracket shaped tine holder 23. To the holder are releasably bolted two tines 22a and 22b.Like the tin 25 the upper tine 22b may be of a synthetic resin and the lowermost tine 22a, on the contrary, of a metal or a solid, wear resistant material.Viewed in a side elevation, the stop fastened to the top of the sleeve part 16 is located between the pivot pin 19 and the upstanding shaft 5 and has otherwise the same function as the stop 21 of fig. 3. The resilient element 51 is formed in this case by a leaf spring inserted into the upper sleeve part 16 . The angular setting of the tines 22, 25 relative to the stub 11 is guarded by the other end 26 of the resilient element 20, 51 being inserted into a body 27, which is rotatable with respect to the upstanding shaft 5 see also fig. 2 . This rotatable body has the form of a circular flange, which is slidably suspended to the spokes 14 by means of two arcuate strips 28 fastened to said spokes. The flange 27 has elongate holes 29, through which the ends 26 are passed.By means of manual adjustment see fig. 4 the ring 27 can be fixed in the desired position relative to the strip 28. This manual adjustment is performed by means of a pin 31 provided with a handle 30, the top end of said pin snapping into a hole of the strip 28 by the action of a compression spring 32 as soon as the pin registers with the hole during the displacement of the ring 27. Discoupling can be performed by drawing the pin 31 down by means of the handle 30 and by subsequently displacing the ring 27. Owing to this displacement the end 26 is moved resulting in a turn of the resilient element 20 around the stub 11 and hence of the sleeve 16, which is coupled with the end 21 of the spring. The tines 22 and 25 respectively follow the sleeve 16. Fig. 6 and 7 show a second alternative embodiment of the tine suspension. The same reference numerals are used in these figures. The tine group 22a, 22b are disengagable fastened to a support 60, to which the lying pivot pin 19 is welded. The lying pivot pin is arranged in the sleeve 16 rotatable about the stub 11, such that the tines 22a, 22b are freely movable in a. vertical plane.The downwards movement of the tine group is limited by a bracket 61 on the support 60, said bracket being adapted to contact a flat surface 62 of the sleeve 16. Preferably the upper tine 22b is made from synthetic resin, for instance polya jnide n y lon . In rder to ensure a rigid mounting of the nylon tine upon the support 60, said tine is inserted into a slitlike opening 63 of a clamping platen 64. Further said platen 64 is profiled such that a indentation 65 its in a throughhole in the tine body 22b. The dimensions are such that said indentation 65 directly rests upon the upperface of tine 22a after the bolt 66 is fastened.At the underside of the tine 22b thetclampingS platen 64 is provided with a support rim 67 near the opening 63, which guides the bending of the tine 22b so preve nting damage of the tine material near the fastening plaçe, Owing to the suggested structure the clamping forces upon e tine 22b are avoided whereas the tine is held by the particular form of the platen 64 only. A certain fastening during a long time is ensured so. The bended end portion 68 of the helical spring 20 around the stub 11 protudes into a hole of an arm 69 of the sleeve 16. The other end portion 26 of the helical spring 20 protudes in a hole of the adjustment ring 27 as described above. The helical spring 20 is centered by the sleeve portion 16 near the lower end, and by a cup like ele ment 70 bolted unto the stub 11 near the upper end. The working of the tine suspension is similar to the.lworking of the previous described embodiment. The lower end of the standing shaft 5 has fas tened to it a sleeve 33, to which are fastened insfork like fashion two hinge wings 34. The end of the wings 34 remote from the sleeve 33 has a hole for receiving a pivot Bin 35, which is journalled in supports 36 welded to the inner side of the dish 8. The supports 36 are prolonged in the direction towards the upstanding shaft 5 and their free, standing edges have a plurality of recesses 38. i Below the sleeve 33 a pin 39 is journalled in the wings 34,said pin supporting a hub 40, to which aihandle 41 is welded. To the side opposite the handle 41 is welded a plate 42, the front edge of which cooperates with the recesses 38 of the supports 36. At the centre, near the front edge of the plate 42, a tensile spring 43 is provided, the other side of which is hooked to the pin 35. From the figures it will be apparent that by drawing upwards the handle 41 the plate 42 is lifted out of a recess 38 so that the dish 8 can turn downwards or upwards about the pin 35 with respect to the upstanding shaft 5. At the release of the handle 41 the spring 43 draws the plate again into a recess 38. From fig. 1 it appears that viewed in the direction of movement indicated by the arrow P 1 the pivots 35 are located in front of the upstanding shaft 5. The invention is not limited to the embodiment described on the foregoing.
