# Coin handling apparatus.

## Abstract
A microprocessor controlled coin handling apparatus, for example for a vending machine, has a plurality of change tubes 22,24,26 each of which is provided with a single level sensor 150,152 for determining whether or not the number of coins in the respective tube 22,24,26 is greater than a predetermined number. The microprocessor 50 keeps a count of the coins in the tube 22,24,26 . When the power is turned on, the count is set to zero if the sensor 150,152 indicates that the number of coins is less than the predeter mined number, and is set to a predetermined full number FULNUM otherwise. The microprocessor 50 increments and decrements the counts as coins are delivered to and dispensed from the change tubes 22,24,26 . Whenever the lavel of coins rises or falls such that the sensor output changes, the coin count is automatically corrected. Also disclosed is a non volatile memory 60 for storing parameters determining how the coins are handled. Keys 102,104,106 are provided for accessing and altering the contents of the memory 60 . Some contents are accessible in a first mode, whereas other contents are inaccessible in this mode, and require a second or third access mode to be entered. At least one location can be altered in a first manner during one of the access modes, and in a second manner only during a different access mode.
