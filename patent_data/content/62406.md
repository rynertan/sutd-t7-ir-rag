## Description
POLYMER STABILISING COMPOSITIONS, POLYMERS STABILISED THEREWITH AND SHAPED ARTICLES FORMED FROM SUCH POLYMERS This invention relates to new and useful polymer stabilizer compositions comprising 1 an organic tin compound or mixture of organic tin compounds, 2 an organic compound having an aromatic ring which is substituted with a hydroxyl OH group and a mercapto SH group ortho to each other and, optionally, 3 an organotin mercaptide or mixture of organotin mercaptides.This invention also relates to polymer compositions comprising 1 an organic polymer, more particularly a halogenated organic polymer, 2 an organic tin compound stabilizer or mixture of organic tin compound stabilizers, 3 an organic compound having an aromatic ring which is substituted with a hydroxyl OH group and a mercapto SH group ortho to each other and, optionally, 4 an organotin mercaptide or mixture of organotin mercaptides.Additionally, this invention relates to articles of manufacture, e.g. pipe, made from polymer compositions comprising 1 an organic polymer, more particularly a halogenated organic polymer, 2 an organic tin compound stabilizer or mixture of organic tin compound stabilizers, 3 an organic compound having an aromatic ring which is substituted with a hydroxyl OH group and a mercapto SH group ortho to each other and, optionally, 4 an organotin mercaptide or mixture of organotin mercaptides. It is well known that various organic polymers undergo deterioration of physical properties and color changes during processing and during exposure of the formed polymer products to various end use environmental conditions. This deterioration of physical properties and color change is particularly pronounced in some polymers e.g. halogenated polymers upon their exposure to heat during processing, particularly the processing into formed articles of commerce. Undesirable color changes are observed to occur at the early states e.g. within the first 5 to 10 minutes of the elevated temperature processing of the polymer as well as during the prolonged exposure of the polymer to heat during processing. Sometimes haziness or cloudiness accompany the color changes of the polymer and is particularly undesirable where clear or colorless products are needed.In many methods for making a polymer into a finished product the polymer remains in the processing apparatus, exposed to high temperatures, for a short period of time and therefore the color change or discoloration of the polymer resulting from prolonged exposure to heat during processing becomes only a minor consideration. The color change of the polymer during such short exposure to heat during processing has become known as early color and is of importance in the shaping of polymers into various products e.g. pipe , particularly products which are to be light in color. Early color is often manifested in various degrees of yellowing of the polymer, although other coloration has also been observed in early color problems. The problem of early color has received increasing attention in recent years and has become a significant consideration in the stabilization of polymers. However, there remains considerable need for improvement of the early color heat stabilization, as well as the long term heat stabilization, of polymers. In the heat stabilization of organic polymers e.g.halogen containing organic polymers early color and long term color formation have been attacked by the art with various stabilizers, mixtures of stabilizers and stabilizer compositions. Organotin compounds e.g. diorganotin mercaptides have been used by the art alone or in combination with various other materials e.g. mercaptoalcohols, phenols and dihydric phenols . However, such prior art stabilizers, combinations of stabilizers and stabilizer compositions have not been entirely satisfactory for a variety of reasons including low effectiveness, high cost, instability, color and poor compatibility. Better stabilizers or stabilizer compositions are needed. There has now been found a surprisingly highly effective composition for stabilizing organic polymers which overcomes many of the disadvantages of prior art stabilizers and which is effective in the early color stabilization of organic polymers during processing.Additionally, there have been surprisingly found organic polymer compositions which have improved resistance to early color formation during processing. In accordance with this invention there is provided a stabilizer composition comprising 1 an organic tin compound or a mixture of organic tin compounds, 2 an organic compound having one or more six membered carbocyclic aromatic rings in which at least one of said aromatic rings has bonded directly thereto a total of from two to five hydroxyl OH and mercapto SH groups with the proviso that at least one hydroxyl group and one mercapto group are directly bonded to adjacent ring carbon atoms and, optionally, 3 an organotin mercaptide or mixture of organotin mercaptides.Further, there is now provided in accordance with this invention an organic polymer composition, having improved resistance to early color formation during processing, comprising, 1 an organic polymer normally susceptible to heat induced deterioration or discoloration, 2 an organic tin compound or mixture of organic tin compounds, 3 an organic compound having one or more six membered carbocyclic aromatic rings in which at least one of said aromatic rings has bonded directly thereto a total of from two to five hydroxyl OH and mercapto SH groups with the proviso that at least one hydroxyl group and one mercapto group are directly bonded to adjacent ring carbon atoms and, optionally, 4 an organotin mercaptide or mixture of organotin mercaptides.There is also now provided in accordance with this invention articles of manufacture, e.g. pipe, which are made from an organic polymer composition having improved resistance to early color formation during processing, comprising 1 an organic polymer, more particularly a halogenated organic polymer, 2 an organic tin compound or mixture of organic tin compound, 3 an organic compound having an aromatic ring which is substituted with a hydroxyl OH group and a mercapto SH group ortho to each other and, optionally, 4 an organotin mercaptide or mixture of organotin mercaptides. The stabilizer composition in accordance with this invention has unexpectedly been found to be highly effective in the stabilization of organic polymers exposed to heat during processing. More especially the stabilizer composition of this invention has been unexpectedly found to be highly effective in the early color stabilization of organic polymers exposed to heat during processing i.e. to be highly effective in reducing or preventing discoloration of an organic polymer during the early stages of the exposure of the organic polymer to heat during processing . There has also now been unexpectedly found in accordance with this invention an advantageous polymer composition having improved stability, more particularly improved resistance to early color formation upon exposure to heat during processing. Additionally, there has now been unexpectedly found in accordance with this invention, articles of manufacture, e.g. pipe, made from polymer, compositions having improved resistance to early color formation upon exposure to heat during the forming of said articles of manufacture. In accordance with this invention, there is now provided a stabilizer composition comprising 1 an organic tin compound or mixture of organic tin compounds, 2 an organic compound having one or more six membered carbocyclic aromatic rings in which at least one of said aromatic rings has bonded directly thereto, a total of from two to five hydroxyl OH and mercapto SH groups with the proviso that at least one hydroxyl group and one mercapto are directly bonded to adjacent ring carbon atoms, and optionally, 3 an organotin mercaptide or mixture of organotin mercaptides.Further, in accordance with this invention there is now provided a polymer composition comprising 1 an organic polymer normally susceptible to deterioration or discoloration upon exposure to heat, 2 an organic tin compound or mixture of organic tin compounds, 3 an organic compound having one or more six membered carbocyclic aromatic rings in which at least one of said aromatic rings has bonded directly thereto a total of from two to five hydroxyl OH and mercapto SH groups with the proviso that at least one hydroxyl group and one mercapto group are directly bonded to adjacent ring carbon atoms and, optionally, 4 an organotin mercaptide or mixture or organotin mercaptides.Additionally, there is now provided in accordance with this invention, articles of manufacture, e.g. pipe, made from a polymer composition comprising 1 an organic polymer, more particularly a halogenated organic polymer, 2 an organic tin compound stabilizer or mixture of organic tin compound stabilizers, 3 an organic compound having an aromatic ring which is substituted with a hydroxyl OH group and a mercapto SH group ortho to each other and, optionally, 4 an organotin mercaptide or mixture of organotin mereaptides.

It should be noted that, in an effort to simplify the foregoing formulae and render them as clear and concise as possible, some letters are used more than once in the same formula and or more than one formula. Thus, for example,R1 appears twice in formula VIII, and also in formulae VI,VII and XIX. It is intended that in those instances where the same letter is used either more than once within the same formula, or in more than one formula, that letter represents at each. independent occurence any group contained in the set of groups encompassed by its definition, or any and all subsets thereof. It is further intended that any modification or limitation in the definition of a particular letter at one occurence does not necessarily affect its definition at any other occurence. For example, she definition of X in formula VI be limited from SR2EMI12.2 SEP th tb O8R SEP , tb OR8, Cl, Er or I to Cl, Br, or I, then X in each of formulas VII, VIII and XIX may still represent at each dent occurence the set of groups consisting of SR2EMI12.3 tb inde SEP en tb ,ORB tb OR8, Cl, Br and I,EMI12.4 tb OCR SEP t tb OCI SEP 8 tb and all subsets thereof such as, for example, SR2, and OR8, or Cl, Br, I and OR . As used herein the term alkyl represents monovalent straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radicals containing, for example, 1 to 20 carbon atoms. The term aryl refers to monovalent C6 ClO aromatic rings such as benzene and naphthalene. The term alkenyl refers to monovalent straight or branched chain C2 to C20 hydrocarbon radicals containing at least one double bond. The term aralkyl represents a monovalent C1 to C20 hydrocarbon radical having attached thereto an aryl radical. The term alkaryl refers to monovalent aryl radicals having attached thereto at least one C1 C2O alkyl group. The term cycloalkyl represents monovalent C3 C8 saturated cycloaliphatic radicals, and the term cycloalkenyl represents C5 C8 cycloaliphatic radicals containing at least one double bond. The organic tin compounds according to formulae I and II and IIa , organic compounds according to formulae III , IV and V and the organotin mercaptides according to formulae VI , VII and VIII may all be prepared by methods well known in the art. For example, methods for preparing the organic tin compounds according to formulae I and it , and the organotin mercaptides according to formulae VI , VII and VIII are disclosed in U.S.Patents Nos. 2,267,777 2,746,946, 3,021,302, 3,565,930, 3,565,931, 3,869,487, 3,979,359, 4,118,371, 4,134,878 and 4,183,846. In accordance with the practice of this invention, the compounds according to formulae III , IV and V have a vicinal OH SH arrangement i.e. have an OH group and an SH group on adjacent ring carbon atoms . However, compounds according to formulae III , IV and V may have, in addition to the first vicinal OH SH arrangement on the ring, further vicinal OH SH arrangements on the ring.Such additional vicinal OH SK arrangements on the ring may be separated from the first vicinal OH SH arrangement on the ring by one or more ring carbon atoms or may occupy a position on the ring adjacent to the first vicinal OH SN arrangement on the ring or may include the OH or SH or bothOH and SH of the first vicinal OH SH arrangement.
