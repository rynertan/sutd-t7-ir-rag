# PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES USEFUL IN THE PREPARATION OF FLUTROLINE

## Abstract
1,1 Di p fluorophenyl urea, 2 carbobenzoxy 8 fluoro 5 p fluorophenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H pyrido 4,3 b indole, an efficient process for converting the former to the latter, further comprising conversion of the latter to 8 fluoro 5 p fluorophenyl 2 4 p fluorophenyl 4 hydroxybutyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H pyrido 4,3 b indole flutroline or to 8 fluoro 5 p fluorophenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H pyrido 4,3 b indole an alternative flutroline intermediate and further, novel processes and intermediates used in converting the latter to flutroline.
