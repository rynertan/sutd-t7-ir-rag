# Process for producing cold rolled steel sheets having excellent press formability and ageing behaviour.

## Abstract
Disclosed are processes for producing cold rolled steel sheets and strips having excellent press formability and ageing behaviour by a continuous annealing method in which specific heating cycles are adopted in combination with steel compositions with lowered phosphorus contents.
