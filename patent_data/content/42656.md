# Heat shield arrangements.

## Abstract
A heat shield arrangement for a strip material has upper and lower series of insulating panels 108, 110 that define between them a gap of limited height for the passage of the material. To lead in deformed stock there is an increased height entry section 130 comprising a reinforced upper structure 112 . This can be followed by upper and lower insulating panels 108a,110 at decreasing spacings from each other to merge into a main region having the limited height gap. The panels may have heating means 148 to give the strip a more uniform transverse temperature profile.
