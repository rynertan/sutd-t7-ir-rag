# SYNDROME PROCESSING FOR MULTIBYTE ERROR CORRECTING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A syndrome processing unit for a multibyte error correcting system includes logical circuitry for performing product operation on selected pairs of 8 bit syndrome bytes, and exclusive OR operations on selected results of the product operations are selectively combined to define usable cofactors that correspond to coefficients of the error locator polynomial if the codeword contains less than the maximum number of errors for which the system has been designed.
