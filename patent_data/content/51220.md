# Thermoplastic copolyester elastomers modified with salts of aliphatic polycarboxylic acid.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic copolyester elastomer composition comprising A a copolyester consisting essentially of a multiplicity of long chain ester units and short chain ester units joined through ester linkages, said long chain ester units being represented by the formula OGO R and said short chain ester units being represented by the formula ODO R where G is a divalent radical remaining after the removal of hydroxyl groups from at least one long chain glycol having a melting point of less than about 55 C and a number average molecular weight of from about 400 4000, R is a divalent radical remaining after removal of carboxyl groups from at least one dicarboxylic acid having a molecular weight of less than about 300, and D is a divalent radical remaining after the removal of hydroxyl groups from at least one aliphatic diol having a molecular weight of less than about 250, with the proviso that at least about 70 mole percent of the short chain ester units are either ethylene terephthalate units or 1,4 butylene terephthalate units, said short chain ester units being present in an amount of 15 95 by weight of said copolyester and B from about 0.1 to 10 by weight based on said copolyester of at least one alkali metal salt of an aliphatic polycarboxylic acid containing at least 20 carbon atoms and having a molecular weight of less than about 1500.
