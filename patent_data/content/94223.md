# VALVE SEAT FACING DEVICE

## Abstract
The present invention provides a device for lapping valve seats 16 of for example steam valves in a power generating station. The device includes means for providing torque to be applied to a crankshaft 20 which includes an eccentric shaft on 28 at least one of its extreme ends. Mounted on each eccentric shaft 28 by way of a loose fitting bearing 33 is a facing disc 23 which are interchangeable to allow different sizes and abrasive grades to be used. During operation the facing discs 23 are pressured towards their respective valve seats 16 being lapped by helical springs 74 held within counterbores 73 of each eccentric shaft 28 thus urging the discs 23 axially outwardly of the crankshaft 20 . During rotation of the crankshaft 20 the discs 23 tend to orbit around the valve seat 16 being faced at a slow rate while moving substantially radially inwardly and outwardly at the rotational frequency of the crankshaft 20 . The device there fore provides a relatively fast and accurate refacing operating to the valve seats 16 which may have been worn or scratched during use. Further the apparatus saves the valve having to be removed from its steam line and thus greatly reduces overall time involved in the operation.
