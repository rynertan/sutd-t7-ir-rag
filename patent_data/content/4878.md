# Purification of crude chlorophosphazene compounds by treatment with water.

## Abstract
A process for the purification of crude chlorophosphazene involves the use of an intermediate purification stage in which the crude chlorophosphazene is subjected to at least two water washings, following which a final purification step is conducted utilizing a conventional chlorophosphazene purification procedure, such as recrystallization, sublimation, distillation, or melt filtering and at least a very high purity cyclic chlorophosphazene trimer is then recovered. In a preferred process, the crude chlorophosphazene is subjected to three water washings prior to the final purification step.
