# Boiler water level monitoring.

## Abstract
The water level in a boiler 9 is monitored by a probe 15 driven by an AC source 11. If the water is high, the water resistance Rw completes a first current path i1 which charges C1 via D1 on alternate half cycles and alternately charges and discharges C2 on successive half cycles. C1 then trans fers its charge through R2 to C3 via path i2, which has a long time constant 20 s . When C3 is charged, amplifier A1 energizes relay RL1, which closes contacts RL1 1, so mod ifying the characteristics of current loop i2, and closes contacts RL1 2, closing fuel valve 44 and allowing boiler 9 to be heated. If the water level falls, charging of C1 via loop i1 ceases charging of C3 via the loop i2 which now has R2 shunted out ceases and C2 discharges through D2 and R4 via loop i3. When the voltage on C3 falls enough, amplifier A1 output changes, de energizing relay RL1, so opening contacts RL1 2 and turning off the boiler flame, and also opening contacts RL1 1 and so re establishing the original characteristics of C3 charging current loop i2.
