## Description
IMMUNOASSAY The present invention relates to an enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay. The general concept of enzyme immunoassay is described in many publications. For a general review see Tmmunoassays Clinical Laboratory Techniques for the 1980 s , Laboratory and Research Methods in biology and Medicine Vol. IV ed. Nakamura R., DitoW.R., Rucker E.S. III published by A.R.Liss 1980 . An enzyme immunoassay involves causing an antigenic analyte to compete in an immunochemical reaction with a known amount of antigen for a limited number of antibody binding sites. An enzyme is used to measure the proportion of the known amount of antigen which has become bound to the antibody, making it possible to calculate the amount of analyte present in a sample with reference to a standard assay result. There are in general two types of enzyme immunoassay, classified by the method employed for detecting the proportion of the known amount of antigen which has become bound to the antibody. In the first type, heterogeneous enzyme immunoassay, either the known amount of antigen or the antibody is immobilised upon a solid phase, the other being labelled in some way. After reaction with a sample solution containing an antigenic analyte the solid phase may be physically removed from the sample solution and may be washed. A substrate for which the label has activity may then be placed in contact with the solid phase in order to estimate the amount of antibody bound to the known amount of antigen. An advantage of this type of enzyme immunoassay is that the physical separation and washing steps tend to increase the assay accuracy by removing extraneous substances introduced from the sample. A disadvantage of heterogeneous enzyme ilumunoassay is that the separation step is time consuming and requires a certain degree of manipulative skill. In the second type, homogeneous enzyme immunoassay, measurement relies upon a change in the properties of a label when antibody binds to a hapten corresponding to the analyte marked with that label.The hapten has at least one antigenic determinant in common with the antigenic analyte and competes with the antigenic analyte for binding to a limited amount of antibody. In homogeneous enzyme immunoassay, separation of the bound and free labelled hapten is unnecessary since the proportion of bound labelled hapten can be estimated by measuring the relative change in the properties of the label. The lack of a separation step renders homogeneous immunoassay easier to perform, faster and cheaper than the corresponding heterogeneous immunoassay. Despite a preference for the use of a homogeneous immunoassay the invention presently to be described may be conducted in the form of a heterogenous immunoassay. One type of homogeneous immunoassay relies upon a change in speoific enzyme activity when an antibody binds to an antigen labelled with an enzyme. This type of assay is known as a homogeneous enzyme labelled immunoassay. In homogeneous enzyme labelled immunoassay a hapten is attached to an enzyme in a position relative to an active site of the enzyme such that the enzymes catalytic action upon the substrate for which it has activity is substantially unimpaired. In use antibody may bind to the hapten and by this binding reduce or destroy the specific activity of the enzyme. The modulation of enzyme activity is thought to be caused either by steric hindrance the antibody physically preventing the substrate engaging the active site on the enzyme or in some cases by a restriction in the conformational flexibility of the enzyme, thereby preventing activity.There are some examples of homogeneous enzyme labelled immunoassay in which the hapten, when attached to the enzyme, impairs the enzyme s specific activity. The binding of an antibody to the hapten reactivates the enzyme. The techniques of homogeneous enzyme labelled immunoassay may be applied for example to the detection of drugs or narcotics in body fluids such as saliva, blood and urine see British patent specification 1401297 and to the detection of steroids in milk see copending published British patent application 2120785 . A second type of homogeneous immunoassay relies upon a change in enzyme inhibition activity when an antibody binds to an antigen corresponding to the analyte, labelled with an enzyme inhibitor. This type of assay is described hereafter as a homogeneous enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay. In homogeneous enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay a hapten is attached to an enzyme inhibitor molecule such that the resulting labelled hapten does not exhibit simultaneous heterobifunctional characteristics. That is, the molecule may bind either to an antibody to the hapten or to the active site of the enzyme for which the enzyme inhibitor has activity. The binding of antibody to the hapten effectively blocks binding of enzyme by the inhibitor resulting in a modification of the inhibitor activity of the inhibitor labelled hapten.The modification may be detected by measuring the inhibition of the activity of an enzyme. A limitation of the first mentioned type of homogeneous immunoassay, the homogeneous enzyme labelled immunoassay, is that the enzyme labelled hapten is, in many cases, difficult to produce reliably and reproduceably. The second type of homogeneous immunoassay, the homogeneous enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay, involves the use of inhibitors which are in many cases small and well defined chemical structures susceptible to chemical synthesis and the ready addition of hapten moieties. The use and formulation of an enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay is described in United States patent specification 4134792. The specification describes an enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay for dinitrophenyl. The immunoassay described involves a conjugate molecule comprising a dinitrophenyl moiety and an acetazolamide moiety.The acetazolamide moiety has an inhibitory action upon the specific activity of carbonic anhydrase.The inhibitor may however be modulated by the formation of an immunocomplex between the conjugate molecule and antibody to dinitrophenyl. A common feature of the known enzyme immunoassay techniques is the use of an enzyme having activity to a substrate unrelated to the sample to be analysed.Indeed in many cases the substrate itself requires careful preparation and the analysis of the enzymic reaction needs careful interpretation. This tends to complicate the assay protocol and renders it time consuming and manipulatively complex. According to a first aspect of the present invention we provide an enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay for measuring the concentration of an antigenic analyte in a sample wherein the substrate for the enzyme forms at least a part of the sample. According to a second aspect of the invention we provide an enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay for measuring the concentration of an antigenic analyte in a sample wherein the inhibitor label is an inhibitor capable of inhibiting the activity of an enzyme capable of clotting milk. Preferably we provide an enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay for measuring the concentration of an antigenic analyte in a sample comprising or consisting of milk wherein the inhibitor label is an inhibitor capable of inhibiting the activity of an enzyme capable of clotting milk.The preferred assay involves the milk sample to be assayed for the antigenic analyte a conjugate molecule comprising a moiety having at least one antigenic determinant in common with the antigenic analyte, the moiety being bonded to an inhibitor capable of inhibiting the activity of an enzyme capable of clotting milk such that the activity of the inhibitor is reduced or eliminated by the immunochemical binding of an antibody to the moiety, an antibody capable of forming an immunochemical bond to the conjugate molecule or to the antigenic analyte and an enzyme capable of clotting milk the assay comprising the steps of allowing a competitive reaction to take place between antigenic analyte in the milk sample, the conjugate molecule and the antibody and determining the activity upon the milk sample of the enzyme capable of clotting milk. The term measuring as used herein is to be taken to include both making a quantitative measurement of the concentration of an analyte in the sample and detecting whether an analyte is present in a sample above or below a predetermined concentration. Preferably the assay is used such that the presence or absence of milk clotting defines a predetermined end point. The milk used in the assay may be milk of any mammal but is preferably the milk of a domestic milk producing animal such as a cow, a sheep or a goat and is most preferably the milk of a cow. Preferably the enzyme used in the assay is chymosin. Chymosin is one of a number of proteolytic enzymes secreted by the fourth stomach abomasum of unweaned calves. It is the active ingredient of rennin also known as rennet and has, for hundreds of years, been used in the production of cheese. The natural substrate of chymosin is the protein casein which is the major solid component of milk. In milk, casein exists as a stable colloid of casein molecules. The addition of chymosin to milk catalyses the cleavage of casein to form proteins which are not stable as a colloid. The cleavage results in an agglutination of the protein molecules an effect which may be observed macroscopically as clotting.The chymosin may be natural chymosin isolated from calves or may be chymosin or 8 chymosin analogue produced by a host organism modified by recombinant DNA techniques see copending published British patent application 2100737 . Other milk clotting enzymes which may be used in the assay of the present invention include proteolytic enzymes such as pepsin and its analogues and enzymes derived from fungal strains such as Mucor pusillus, Mucor meihei and Endothia parasitica. The inhibitor used to produce the inhibitor labelled hapten must be capable of reducing or eliminating the specific activity of the enzyme capable of clotting milk and must be such that when bound to a hasten its inhibition activity is reduced by the binding of an antibody to the hapten. Many such inhibitors are known to the art seeBibliography at the end of this specification . The inhibitor may be selected from one of four groups of inhibitors. The amino acid sequences given hereafter use standard notation for amino acid residues. e.g.val valyl ala alanyl etc. . The amino acid statine has the formal chemical name 4 S amino, 3 S hydroxy, 6 methylheptanoic acid . The first group comprises the polypeptide pepstatin EMI7.1 Iva val val sta ala statine and analogues of pepstatin, example of which are N acetyl val val sta ala statine, N acetyl val sta ala statine, N acetyl statine, N acetyl ala statine, N acetyl val statine, statine, ala statine,EMI7.2 N acetyl sta ala NHiC5H11, Iva sta ala N111c5 i11, Iva val 3S,4S sta ala NHiC5H11, Iva vaf 3R,4S sta ala NHiC5Hll, Iva val 3S,4S 4 amino 3 hydroxy 5 phenylpentanoic acid ala NHiC5H11,Iva val 3S,4S 4 S amino 6 methylheptanoic acid ala NHiC5H11, Iva val sta,EMI8.1 Iva val statone ala NHiC5H11, andIva val 4 S amino 6 methylheptatonic acid ala NHiC5H11. The pepstatin or pepstatin analogue may be further modified by the inclusion of a C terminal group, especially one selected from the group arg OMe, asp, glu, asp arg, and gly lys lys. The addition of gly lys lys to the C terminal of pepstatin or pepstatin derivative advantageously increases the water solubility of the derivative. The second group comprises synthetic polypeptides having the general structure R phe phe W X wherein X is a C terminal D a ino acid radical, W is an amino acid radical and R is , amino acid radical or a polypeptide radical having two or more amino acids. Preferably X is D leucine, W is valine and R is selected from the group pro ,D phe pro , glu D phe pro , D glu D phe pro . The third group comprises synthetic polypeptides having the general structure H his pro phe his Y val tyr OH wherein Y isEMI9.1 The fourth group comprises synthetic polypeptides having the structure P ser Z ala Q, P val Z val Q or P asp Z ala Q whereinZ is statine or Z is a diradical of the general formulaEMI9.2 EMI9.3 EMI9.4 a retroinverso peptide analogue andR2 is CH2CH2CH2CH3, CH2CH2SCH3 or H, and whereinP is selected from A , his A , pro his A, his pro his A , pro his pro his A, his pro his pro his A, and arg his pro his prohis A, wherein A is a leucine or valine radical, and wherein Q is selected from B, B pro, B pro pro, B pro pro lys, B pro pro lys lys, and B pro pro lys lys asn, wherein B is an isoleucine or leucine radical.Preferably R1 is CH2 NH orEMI10.1 Preferably the inhibitors of the fourth group are synthetic polypeptides of the general formulae, leu asp Z ala ile pro pro lys lys, his leu asp Z ala ile pro pro lys lys, leu ser Z ala ile pro pro lys lys or his leu ser Z ala ile pro pro lys lys, wherein Z is as previously defined. Preferably Z is statine. The following inhibitors of the fourth group are thus especially preferred his leu ser sta ala ile pro pro lys lys leu ser sta ala ile pro pro lys lys The C terminal andior the N terminal amino acid of any of the inhibitors may be substituted. For example the C terminal amino acid may be esterified and or the N terminal amino acid may be acylated. The basis of the enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay of the present invention is a competitive immunological reaction set up between the analyte, a labelled hapten also referred to as a conjugate molecule and a limiting amount of antibody. The antibody, which may be a monoclonal or a polyclonal antibody, has specificity for one or more determinants common to both analyte and hapten. The hapten is labelled by conjugation with a molecule capable of reducing the activity of an enzyme capable of clotting milk. The resulting conjugate molecule alone is also capable of reducing the activity of an enzyme capable of clotting milk. The labelled hapten is so constructed that when antibody binds to the hapten the inhibitor is deactivated.In this way the proportion of labelled hapten left unbound to antibody in an assay sample can be determined by its effect upon the milk clotting activity of an enzyme capable of clotting milk added to or included in the sample of milk When analyte is present in the milk sample under test, following reaction of the assay components, a significant proportion of labelled hapten remains free of antibody. The free labelled hapten may then combine via its inhibitor label with enzyme added to or included in the sample, thereby deactivating the enzyme. The activity of the enzyme may be readily tested by the addition to, or inclusion in, the sample of a quantity of milk. When analyte is present in a sample under test no clotting will be observed. When analyte is not prese t in the sample under test, following reaction of the assay components a significant proportion of labelled hapten becomes bound to antibody. The inhibitor label of the hapten is deactivated resulting in little or no deactivation of enzyme activity. When analyte is absent or present in very low concentrations, clotting of milk included in or added to the sample will be observed. The assay reagents and sample may be mixed together in any order or combination. In a particular application of the present invention the homogenous enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay is used to determine the concentration of hormones naturally present in cows milk. The economics of dairy farming require the production of one calf per cow per year. This is necessary in order to ensure a satisfactory and constant supply of milk from a dairy herd. The calving index of a cow is the number of days that pass between successive calvings. Thus the ideal calving index is 365 days and extensions beyond this are likely to affect adversely the profitability of a cow. It is essential to good herd management that the correct time is chosen for insemination and that a check is available subsequently to ensure that conception has occurred. Traditionally the correct time for arranging for insemination of a cow was judged by the herd manager on the basis of the behaviour of the cow. The diagnosis of pregnancy relied either upon a study of the cows subsequent behaviour or upon a rectal examination by a veterinary surgeon some 10 to 15 weeks after insemination. The necessary delay before making a physical examination often is considerable.These traditional methods are still extensively used today. It is know that the level of progestagen in the milk of lactating dairy cows reflects ovarian activity. The cow is a polyoestrus animal and ovulates spontaneously in an oestrus cycle having a period of approximately twenty one days. The level of a particular progestagen, progesterone, in milk varies cyclically over the period between successive ovulations. The concentration of progesterone in a cow s milk builds up gradually after oestrus from a very low level to a plateau of about 25 ng ml milk and drops sharply to a very low level immediately before the next ovulation. It is further known that if a successful insemination is carried out on the day of oestrus, the level of progesterone in milk remains high throughout the pregnancy. British patent specification 1402263 describes a method of diagnosing pregnancy in an inseminated milk producing domestic animal in which an assay for progestagen is carried out on the milk of the animal in order to ascertain whether the progestagen concentration is varying cyclically or is fixed at high value. The latter result is indicative of pregnancy. The methods of assay described in British patent specification 1402263 are competitive protein binding assay and radioimmunoassay. Both these as says require skilled work and specialised equipment, and often involve considerable time delays. An alternative method of diagnosing pregnancy in cows is described in British patent specification 2040043. The level of an oestrogen metabolite, oestrone sulphate, in milk increases gradually during pregnancy and. gives a further indication of successful insemination. British patent specification 2040043 describes a method of measuring the level of oestrone sulphate in rilk using an enzyme linked immunoassay involving a colourimetric determination of end point. Such an assay involves less skill on the part of the ot or but nevertheless is time consuming and complex. Many countries now have co erical laboratories which will assay milk samples for progesterone. The technique most commonly used by such laboratories is radioimmunoassay. This inevitably involves delay, and if the assay is required for othe purposes of detecting oestrus the result of the assay may arrive too late for successful insemination. There is therefore a great need in the dairy industry for a simple and effective assay for progestagens, progestagen metabolites, oestrogens and oestrogen metabolites such that the herd manager can perform a cow side test for oestrus or for pregnancy. Copending published British patent application 2120785 describes an enzyme labelled immunoassay for use in testing for oestrus or pregnancy in domestic milk producing animals. According to a third aspect of the present invention we provide an enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay for measuring the concentration of a steroid in a sample wherein the steroid is selected from the group consisting of a progestagen, a progestagen metabolite, an oestrogen and an oestrogen metabolite. Preferably the sample is a sample of milk from a domestic milk producing animal most preferably a cow. Preferably the steroid is progesterone, oestrone sulphate or an analogue of either. A number of diagnostic tests to be applied to cows are made possible by the assay of the present invention. According to a fourth aspect of the invention oestrus in a milk producing domestic animal such as a cow, a sheep or a goat is detected by monitoring the level of progesterone in the milk of the animal using the assay of the present invention. The assay may be used, for example, to indicate when the level of progesterone in the milk of the animal falls below a predetermined value. In the general method, using a homogeneous enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay, a molecule of progesterone or a molecule having at least one antigenic determinant in common with progesterone is chemically bonded to an inhibitor molecule. In performing the assay a mixture is prepared consisting of the progesterone inhibitor conjugate molecule, a limiting amount of antibody to progesterone and a sample of milk including inter alia the progesterone and casein.A competitive equilibrium is established in which the free progesterone and the progesterone inhibitor conjugate molecule compete for the limiting amount of antibody. Chymosin may be included in the initial mixture or may be added after equilibrium has been reached. If the progesterone is absent or present only in low concentration in the milk sample a significant fraction of the antibody will bind to the progesterone inhibitor conjugate. The action of the inhibitor upon the chymosin will be impaired and clotting of the milk will be observed. In the alternative, if progesterone is present in the milk sample a significant fraction of the antibody will become bound to the progesterone in the sample.This will result in the presence of non immunocomplexed progesterone inhibitor conjugate in the sample, the chymosin will therefore be substantially inactive and no clotting of the milk sample will be observed. The sensitivity of the assay may be e5sted by altering the concentrations of the various reagents used in the assay. It is also possible to adjust the sensitivity of the assay by chtgU the order in which the reagents are admixed. For example, the addition of the antibody to the milk sample before the progesterone inhibitor conjugate will affect the sensitivity. In general a level of progesterone below 4 ng ml is indicative of the onsent of oestrus. In a practical situation the dairyman can take a sample of milk from a cow whilst in the dairy. The sample may be placed in a suitable receptacle and the various reagents may be added or in the alternative the sample may be added to the reagents in a suitable receptacle. Following initial mixing the presence or absence of clotting may be observed. When using the assay for progesterone a change in the result from non clotting to clotting may be taken as an indication of the onset of oestrus, indicating as it does that the concentration of progesterone in the cow s milk has fallen below a predetermined level. We further provide, in a fifth aspect of the invention, a method for detecting pregnancy in a milk producing domestic animal, comprising using an enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay according to the invention to monitor the concentration of progesterone in the milk of the animal, pregnancy being indicated by the lack of a drop in the concentration of progesterone below a predetermined concentration at a time when oestrus would be expected. We further provide, in a sixth aspect of the invention, a method for detecting pregnancy in a milk producing domestic animal, comprising using an enzyme inhibitor labelled rmmunoassay according to the invention to monitor the concentration of oestrone sulphate in the milk of the animal, pregnancy being indicated by a concentration of oestrone sulphate above a redetermined concentration. There is currently graat interest in the dairy industry in the detection of a substance known as aflatoxin M1. The aflatoxins are mycotoxins originating from fungal contamination of certain cattle feeds. The compounds and their metabolites are mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic.Aflatoxin M1 is one of aflatoxin metabolites and is of particular interest as it retains a very high toxicity and appears in the milk of cattle which have consumed contaminated feed. Clearly there is a need for a fast and reliable assay to ensure that milk containing aflatoxins and in particular aflatoxin M1 does not reach consumers. Aflatoxin M1 is of a similar molecular size to the steroids and the acceptable concentrations in milk are similar to those of steroid metabolites naturally found in milk. According to a seventh aspect of the invention we provide a method for monitoring the concentration of an aflatoxin metabolite, preferably aflatoxin M1 in the milk of milk producing domestic animals comprising using an enzyme inhibitor labelled immunoassay of the invention to measure the concentration of aflatoxin in the milk of the animal. Preferably the above methods are applied in relation to a cow and cow s milk. According to an eighth aspect of the present invention we provide an inhibitor for an enzyme capable of clotting milk wherein the inhibitor is a synthetic polypeptide of the fourth group of inhibitors described above. According to a ninth aspect of the invention we provide a conjugate molecule comprising a hapten labelled with an inhibitor capable of inhibiting the activity of an enzyme capable of clotting milk. The labelled hapten is constructed such that when antibody binds to the hapten the inhibitor is substantially deactivated. The hapten may be any antigenic molecule, those steroids described with reference to the fourth, fifth and sixth aspects of the present invention and the toxin described with reference to the seventh aspect of the present invention being particularly preferred. The inhibitor may be any inhibitor described above and is preferably selected from the fourth group of inhibitors described above. In particular, with reference to the fourth and fifth aspects of the invention, a preferred conjugate molecule is selected from the groupEMI18.1 wherein R3 is a radical or diradical derived from any one of the inhibitors described above, and R4 is aflatoxin M1 EMI18.2 Particularly preferre c a conjugate molecule having as R3 any of the inhibitors of the fourth group of inhibitors described above. Suitable conjugate molecules includeEMI18.3 EMI19.1 In an assay of the third aspect of the invention it is preferred that the progesterone antibody has been raised against a progesterone immunogen where the progesterone hapten has been linked to a carrier protein via a C llce substituent. According to a tenth aspect of the invention we provide a reagent kit for performing an immunoassay of the present invention, the kit comprising, separately or in combination, a conjugate molecule of the ninth aspect of the invention, an antibody capable of binding to an antigenic determinant of the conjugate molecule and an enzyme capable of clotting milk. The kit may comprise the reagents combined together in a suitable container for example in an assay receptacle. Alternatively the kit may comprise the reagents packed separately or combined in pairs with a third separately packaged. The reagents may be in a stabilised form, for example in a lyophilised form. Some embodiments of the present invention are now described as examples, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows the results of a checkerboard titration on a microtiter plate indicating the effect upon milk samples of various dilutions of chymosin and anti progesterone in the presence of a chymosin inhibitor progesterone conjugate molecule. Figure 2 shows the results of a checkerboard titration as in Figure 1 without chymosin inhibitor progesterone conjugate molecule. Figure 3 shows the results of a titration on a microtiter plate indicating the effect upon milk samples of various dilutions of chymosin in the present of anti progesterone or progesterone or a combination of both, all wells having added chymosin inhibitor progesterone conjugate molecule.

Testing of Inhibitors and Progesterone Inhibitor conjugates for enzyme inhibitor activity Enzyme inhibition data was obtained using synthetic peptide substrates containing a chromophoric nitrophenylalanine residue in the position of the scissile bond so that hydroysis can be followed spectrophotometrically. Hydrolysis was followed at 300 nm and the substrate can be used at any pH value usually between 2 6 at which the enzyme is active.

Testing of Progesterone inhibitor conjugates for inhibition of chymosin milk clotting activity and for modulation of their inhibition of chymosin milk clotting activity by reaction with progesterone antibody Milk clotting as says were carried out in the wells of microtiter plates. In each assay, after a suitable reaction time, the microtiter plate was inverted.Where clotting occurred, the clots remained in the wells of the plate, and where there was no clotting, the contents of the wells were decanted. The general assay procedure was as follows 2 91 of assay buffer containing 0.2 bovine serum albumin was pipetted into the wells of a microtiter plate. This was followed by 25P1 of assay buffer alone, or assay buffer containing the desired concentration of progesterone inhibitor conjugate followed by 25P1 of assay buffer alone, or assay buffer containing the desired concentration of progesterone antibody. Then 3qil of assay buffer containing the desired concentration of chymosin was added. This was followed by 100 pal of a milk substrate solution The microtiter plate containing the assay mixture was placed in an incubator at 370 C for 1 hour.At the end of this time the plate was inverted over sink snd tapped very lightly a few times, and then placed inverted on some tissue paper. The presence of clots was readily observed and either scored on a microtiter plate diagram or alternatively the inverted plate was photocopied against a dark background. In order to demonstrate that an inhibition of chymosin milk clotting activity by a progesterone inhibitor conjugate could be modulated by immunoreaction of an antibody with a progesterone inhibitor conjugate, a series of dilutions of chymosin were used together with a fixed amount of progesterone inhibitor conjugate sufficient to provide a noticeable inhibition of enzyme activity , a series of dilutions of progesterone antibody and a milk substrate in the previously described assay format. Dilutions of chymosin in assay buffer were prepared at 1 1000, 1 1100, 1 1210, 1 1331, 1 1464, 1 1611, 1 1772, 1 1949. 30 1 of each diluted enzyme solution was used in each microtiter well. A solution of the progesterone inhibitor designatedP4SP2, at a concentration of 40 pmol ml was prepared 25 jil lpmol being used in each microtiter well. Dilutions of sheep polyclonal antiserum HPS 53 IIb supplied by Guildhay Antisera were prepared at 1 50, 1 100 and 1 200 25 ul of each dilution being used in each microtiter well. The protocol followed was as described above.The results of the experiment are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows that inhibition of the milk clotting activity of chymosin, effected by the progesterone inhibitor conjugate P4SP2, can be modulated by the addition of antibody. Figure 2 shows the result of a control experiment in which no progesterone inhibitor conjugate is present.5. Tmmunoassay System for Detecting Steroid in Milk The results of the experiment described above were used to select an antibody concentration at which modulation of the inhibition of chymosin milk clotting activity was possible. A further experiment was then conducted to investigate the effect of free steroid on the modulation of inhibitor activity by antibody. A 1 50 dilution of antibody to progesterone HPS53 IIb Guildhay antisera was used, together with a fixed concentration of progesterone inhibitor conjugate P4SP2 100 pmol ml . The final concentration of conjugate was 1 pmol well.Progesterone was dissolved in assay buffer at a concentration of 0.5 nmol ml, to give a final concentration of 7.5 pmol well. Incubation mixtures containing 0.571 ml of assay buffer containing 0.2 BSA, 0.714 ml of dilute antibody, 0.429 ml of progesterone in assay buffer and 0.286 ml of inhibitor conjugate were prepared. Control incubates were also prepared in which antibody, progesterone, or both were replaced by equivalent volumes of assay buffer. A similar series of incubation mixtures in which progesterone inhibitor conjugate was replaced by assay buffer was also prepared. These mixtures were incubated at 40C for 2 hours. At the end of the incubation, 70pal of incubate was transferred to each well in duplicate rows on the microtitre plate.Dilution of a lmg ml solution of chymosin in assay buffer were prepared as follows 1 1210 1 1331, 1 1464, 1 1611, 1 1772, 1 1949, 1 2144, 1 2358, 1 2594, 1 2835, 1 3138, 1 3452. 30P1 of each dilution was added to each well in a column of the microtitre plates. These dilutions gave a final concentration of 0.71, 0.64, 0.58, 0.53, 0.48, 0.44, 0.40, 0.36, 0.33, 0.30, 0.27 and 0.25 pmol well. 100ul of milk substrate was added to each well and the plates were incubated for one hour at 370C before checking for clotting. The results obtained are shown in Figure 3. The results obtained with the control plate are shown in Figure 4. In the absence of progesterone, antibody and progesterone inhibitor conjugate, the limiting concentration of chymosin necessary for clotting is 0.36 pmol well. In the presence of progesterone alone, the limiting concentration remains the same, while in the presence of antibody it is increased to 0.40 pmol well. When 1 pmol well of the inhibitor is present, clotting is inhibited so that 0.44 pmol well of chymosin is required to give a visible clot. As observed in the earlier experiment, clotting is restored in the preseance of antibody.However in the presence of progesterone, antibody restoration of clotting activity was impaired.
