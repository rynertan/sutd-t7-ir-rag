## Description
POWER DIVIDER COMBlNER CIRCUITBackground of the Invention r This invention relates to power divider combiner circuits, and more particularly to a monolithic broadband power divider combiner having amplification inherent in the circuit. Increasing the power handling capabilities of solid state devices by increasing their size, or by connecting several of them in parallel or in series within a package can cause problems related to impedance matching, instability, heat dissipation, reliability and yield. This creeates the need for power combining of complete amplifiers or oscillators. In the past, power combining circuits have utilized discrete amplifiers having inputs connected to a power source through a power divider, and outputs connected through a power combiner to a single output port. N way hybrid power dividers and combiners are well known in the art. Hybrid power dividers and combiners are actually identical in structure, except their input and output terminals are reversed. Radial and fork hybrid divider combiner structures are a class of devices first described by Wilkinson,U.S. patent 3,091,743, which are suitable for narrowband applications. Considerable broadbanding can be achieved by utilizing stepped stripline quarter wave elements, or by cascading techniques wherein the lines become odd numbers of quarter wave lengths beyond 1 however, the application and the mathematical relationships of these may become unwieldy. The distributed amplifier is a high gain, wideband amplifier which has been used widely in various kinds of electronic equipment. With the advance of modern integrated circuit technology and with the aid of computers, distributed amplifiers have been designed and built on microstrip with MOSFETs however, these devices are not suitable for operation in the 10 to 50 GHz region of the microwave spectrum. In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide improved power divider combiner circuits for broadband operation. It is another object of the present invention to provide improved microwave power divider combiner circuits which are batch processable, monolithic integrated circuits. Another object of the present invention is to provide improved monolithic power divider combiner devices for broadband operation in the microwave spectrum and having amplifier circuits inherent in the devices. It is a more specific object of the present invention to provide an improved power combining circuit having amplification inherent in the divider combiner devices thereof.Summary of the Invention In accordance with one aspect of the present invention.there is provided a broadband power divider circuit receiving an input power wave in an input wave transmission line which is common to a pair of distributed amplifiers.Output wave transmission lines of each of the distributed amplifiers couple the divided, equiphase, equal amplitude power wave to output ports. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the distributed amplifiers are formed as monolithic gallium arsenide integrated circuits. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an improved power combining circuit comprising a power divider coupled to a power combiner. The divider and combiner each comprise a pair of merged distributed amplifiers, the distributed amplifiers of the power divider having a merged input wave transmission line receiving the input signal, and the distributed amplifiers of the power combiner having a merged output wave transmission line delivering the output signal. The output wave transmission lines of the power divider are coupled to the input wave transmission lines of the power combiner. While the invention is set forth with particularity in the appended claims, other objects. features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent and the invention will best be understood by referring to the following detailed description iS conjunction with the accompanying drawing.Brief descr ption of the Drawing Fig. 1 is an electrical schematic diagram of a power divider circuit in accordance with the instant invention. Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a power divider in accordance with the present invention. Fig. 3 is a block diagram of a power combining circuit in accordance with the present invention. Fig. 4 is an electrical schematic diagram of a power combiner circuit in accordance with the present invention.Description of the Preferred Embodiment Referring now to the drawing for a more detailed description of the construction, operation and other features of the invention by characters of reference, Fig. 1 shows a power divider circuit 10 receiving an input signal at an input terminal 12 to divide the applied power for delivery to output terminals 14, 16. The signal on the input terminal 12 is applied to an input wave transmission line 18 comprised of a series of inductors 20 23 and a termination impedance 26. A first, three section distributed amplifier 30 is comprised of three field effect transistors FET 32, 33, 34. Each of the FETs 32. 33. 34 includes a gate G, a sourceS, and a drain D as illustrated by the literal designations adjacent the FET 32 in Fig. 1.The gates of the FETs 32, 33. 34 are connected to the input wave transmission line 18, respectively, at junction points 36, 37. 38 intermediate the inductors 20, 21, 22, 23. The source of each of theFETs 32, 33, 34 is grounded. The drains of the FETs 32, 33, 34 are connected to a first output wave transmission line 40 which is comprised of inductors 42. 43, 44. The output wave transmission line 40 is coupled to the output terminal 14. The output wave transmission line 40 is formed by utilizing the drain to source capacitance of the FETs 32, 33, 34 to shunt, respectively, the inductors 42, 43, 44 in a manner well known in the art. See E.L. Ginzton, et. al., Distributed Amplification, Proc.IRE, vol. 36, pp. 956 969, August, 1948 and Pettit and McWhorter ElectronicAmplifier circuits, McGraw Hill Book Co, New York, N.Y., 1961, chap. 6, Additive Amplification. A second, three section distributed amplifier 50 is comprised of FETs 52, 53, 54 having gates connected, respectively, to the same junction points 36, 37, 38 of the input wave transmission line 18 as the FETs 32, 33, 34 of the other distributed amplifier 30. The sources of theFETs 52, 53, 54 are grounded. The drains of the FETs 52, 53, 54 are connected to a second output wave transmission line 55 of the second distributed amplifier 50. The second output wave transmission line 55 is coupled to the output terminal 16. The transmission line 55 is comprised of inductors 56, 57, 58 which are shunted, respectively, by the drain to source capacitance of the FETs 52, 53, 54. Power division combining is achieved in the instant invention by merging the input output transmission lines of two distributed amplifiers. Referring still to Fig. 1, the input wave or gate transmission line 18 is common to both distributed amplifiers 30, 50, and utilizes the merged gate to source capacitances of the pair of FETs in each of the respective sections of the merged distributed amplifiers to shunt the corresponding inductor of the gate line 18. The power divider circuit 10 of Fig. 1 is conveniently formed as a planar monolithic structure on a substrate of semiconductor material, preferably gallium aresenide for operation in the microwave spectrum. The inductors are planar elements with crossovers. Drain bias may be applied through the output terminals 14, 16, or alternatively on the chip through AC coupled terminations connected respec tively at junction points 60, 61 of the transmission lines 40, 55. One such drain bias input means 62 is shown in Fig. 1 connected to the junction point 61 by dashed lines to indicate that the connection is optional. Gate bias can be similarly applied through the input terminal 12, or on the chip through an AC coupled termination not shown connected to the gate line 18. The merged distributed amplifiers 30, 50 of the power divider circuit 10 provide two way power division with inherent gain and the increased bandwidth characteristic of distributed amplifiers. The instant embodiment is described having three sect ions in each of the merged distributed amplifiers stages the number of FETs per stage may be varied to achieve the gain and bandwidth desired. The output wave or drain transmission lines 40. 55 are designed with tapered line sections so that reverse terminations are not required therefore, substantially the entire output current of the FETs is effectively used in the output loads.The lines 40, 55 may also be designed with reverse termination impedances, thereby providing for D.C. operation. The power divider circuit 10 of Fig. 1, may be cascaded with other like circuits to form multiple output dividers.Fig. 2 shows a power divider circuit 70 like the power divider circuit 10 of claim 1 having its output terminals coupled to two like power divider circuits 72, 74, thus realizing a four way divider having output terminals 75 78. In such n way dividers wherein the number of output ports is equal to a power of two, any reflected power waves generated by the output loads inherently cancel. When the number of output ports is not equal to 2X, means must be provided for shifting the phase of certain of the output signals in order to achieve equiphase outputs. For example, referring again to Fig. 2, a 3 way power divider circuit comprising two divider circuits 70, 72 and having three output terminals 75, 76, 80 would require a phase shifter at the third output 80 to achieve equiphase outputs at all the output terminals. Alternatively, a three way divider having equiphase outputs can be realized with the 4 way structure of Fig.2 by dissipating one of the outputs in a matched load. Referring to Fig. 3 in conjunetion with rigs. 1 and 4, there is shown in Fig. 3 a power combining circuit having amplification inherent in power divider and combiner elements.A power divider circuit 820 like the divider circuit 10 of Fig. 1. is coupled to a power combiner circuit 84. The power combiner circuit 84 is identical to the Fig. 1 circuit except that the gates and drains of the FETs in the distributed amplifiers are reversed as shown in detail in Fig. 4. The output terminals of the divider circuit 82 are capacitively coupled to the input terminals 86, 87 of the power combiner 84. A merged drain or output wave transmission line 90 couples the combined and amplified output signal to a single output terminal 92. There has been disclosed herein an improved broadband microwave power divider combiner having merged distributed amplifier stages. Many modifications and variations of the invention are possible in light of the above teachings.For example, the power combining circuit as shown in Fig.3, may include discrete amplifier stages intermediate the power divider 82 and the power combiner 84. The appended claims are intended to cover and embrace any such modifications which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
