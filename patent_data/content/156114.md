# Axial position lock for telescoping steering column.

## Abstract
A telescoping steering shaft includes a first shaft 16 having a polygonal shaped bore 18 receiving for reciproca tion therein a polygonal shaped second shaft 12 having a tapered end 13 . The polygonal shaped second shaft 12 has a through axial opening 14 receiving a connecting rod 20 therein, the rod having a nut shaped end 26 located adjacent the tapered end 13 of the second shaft 12 and the other end 15 being threaded to receive a lever 24 thereon. A collet nut 31 is mounted on the rod 20 adjacent the nut shaped end 26 and has a plurality of axially extending projections 36 each including at least one surface 37 or 38 disposed parallel to an adjacent surface of the polygonal bore 18 and an interior axially inclined surface 35 disposed adjacent the tapered end 13 . Rotation of the lever 24 about the rod 20 axially displaces the rod toward the lever which causes the inclined surfaces 35 of the projections 36 to engage the tapered end 13 and bias the projections 36 outwardly into engagement with the adjacent parallel surfaces of the bore 18 , thereby eliminating torsional lash and axial movement between the shafts 12, 16 .
