# Method and system for detecting the position of and apparatus for positioning a read write head in seek operation on a disk memory having data and servo sectors.

## Abstract
A system for detecting a head position for use in a tracking servo system to accurately and quickly place a read write head 31, 32 on a selected data track of a magnetic disk memory 30 . The magnetic disk comprises data sectors and servo sectors embedded between the data sectors. A two phase servo informa tion pattern of a 4 track period is recorded on each of the servo sectors. Servo information A, B, C, D is reproduced by the read write head from the each servo sector to produce two phase first and second position signals X, Y which vary like a substantially trapezoidal waveform as a function of head position. A track on which the head is present among the tracks within one period of the servo information pattern is detected dependent on the polarity relation between the first and second position signals. Third and fourth positions signals U, V are formed which respectively correspond to the sum of and the difference between the first and second position signals X, Y . The present positions of the head within the detected track is accurately obtained in accordance with either one of the third and fourth positions signals U, V which varies linearly in the detected track. A head actuator 33 is controlled in accordance with a distance between the present position of the head 31,32 and the selected track, so that the head is accurately and quickly positioned in the target track.
