## Description
DESCRIPTIGN This invention relates to control cable apparatus having a control cable axially movable within and relative to a flexible wire wound conduit and, nore particularly, to means for restraining movement of the conduit relative to a bulkhead or bracket through which the conduit passes. The present invention includes control cable apparatus having a control cable axially movable within and relative to a flexible wire wound conduit provided with an adjustment member having a central bore formed with an internal thread corresponding to an external thread form on the wire wound conduit and an abutment msiher having a central bore arranged slidably to accomrPdate the wire wound conduit, the abutment mlmber being arranged to nonrotatably abut a bulkhead or bracket and the adjustment member and abutment member being arranged separably to engage together to restrain relative movement therebetween with the adjustment member formed with a multiplicity of axially extending faces and a radially extending flange and the abutment member formed with a resilient shroud having internal faces registerable with the axially ext ending faces on the abutment member and faces extending perpendicular to the central bore axis abut table with faces to either side of the radially extending flange. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the acoo panying isometric view of a restraint device 2 for a wire wound conduit 4 of a control cable 6 including an abutment member 8 and an adjustment member 10 each formed in acetal resin material and penetrated by a central bore. The bore of the adjustment member 10 is internally Irpulded with a thread form adapted to co act with and run freely on convolutions formed in winding the wire wound conduit 4 whilst the bore of the abutment member 8 is of a diameter greater than that of the conduit. The abutment member 8 is formed with a stem 12 extending co axially with the central bore, and provided with an axial lug 14 to engage a slotted aperture of corresponding form in a bulkhead or bracket not shown , to prevent rotation of the abutment member. A head portion of the stem is formed with a boss 16 carrying a shroud 18 extending co axially of the central bore formed by two diametrically opposed webs extending axially iran the boss to a cylindrical portion 20 formed internally with two, diametrically opposed, enlargements 21 having flat faces 22. The boss is cut away adjacent the webs to enhance flexibility of the webs. The adjustment member 10 includes a body portion formed with a scalloped surface 24 co axial of the central bore and an end extension 26 having an intermediate portion 28 formed with six, equi angularly spaced, flat faces 30 and an outer portion formed as a cylindrical flange 32 stepped outwardly from the intermediate portion and cut away to provide two, diametrically opposed flat faces 34 registering with the internal flat faces 22 formed on the shroud of the abutment member. In operation, the adjustment member 10 is threaded, and the abutment meMber 8 slid, onto the control cable conduit 4, and, an end portion of the conduit is passed through the aperture in the bulkhead or bracket. The abutment member 8 is then slid along the conduit to abut the bulkhead or bracket with the axial lug 14 on the stem 12 engaging in the slotted portion of the aperture and the adjustment meMber 10 is rotated to a position adjoining the abutment member giving a location of the conduit approximating to that required.The conduit and adjusting member are then moved axially to engage the cylindrical flange 32 and an intermediate portion 28 of the adjusting meMber within the shroud 18 of the abutment member, initially registering the two diainetrically opposed flat faces 34, 22 on the respective members to permit the engagement.The axial movement is continued such that the intermediate portion 28 of the adjusting neeber, formed with the six, equi angularly spaced, flat faces 30, registers with the cylindrical portion 20 of the shroud on the abutment member formed internally with the two diametrically opposed, flat faces 20 and the adjusting member rotated through 600. There is sufficient resilience in the shroud 18 to permit elastic deformation and thereby permit rotation of the adjustment member 10 relative to the abutment mEmber 8 even though the diametrical dimension between opposed arrises between the six equi angularly spaced flat faces 30 on the adjustment member is greater than the diametrical dimension between the two diametrically opposed flat faces 22 on the abutment member in an undeformed configuration.Thus, since rotation of the abutment member is prevented by virtue of engagement of the axial lug with the slotted portion of the aperture in the bulkhead or bracket and axial movement of the abutment member in one direction is prevented by virtue of the abutment member abutting the bulkhead or bracket and since the adjustment member is restrained from rotation relative to the abutment member by virtue of engagement between the two, diametrically opposed flat faces 22 on the abutment member with two corresponding faces of the six, equi angularly spaced faces 30 on the adjustment meMber and restrained from axial movement relative to the abutment member by virtue of engagement of the cylindrical flange 32 on the adjustment member with the enlargements 21 of the cylindrical portion 20 of the shroud 18 of the abutment member, axial movement of the wire wound conduit 4 in one direction is restrained. If it is desired additionally to restrain axial movement of the wire wound conduit in the other direction a second abutment member and second adjustment member having effect in that direction may be provided, with the second abutment neeber abutting and engaging a second bulkhead or bracket. Alternatively, a further abutment member may be formed with a socket to non rotatably engage the stem portion of a first abutment member protruding through a bulkhead or bracket such that the first and further abutment members abut either side of the bulkhead or bracket.
