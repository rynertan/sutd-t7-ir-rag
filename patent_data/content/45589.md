# Portable pH meter for effluents having a self cleaning electrode chamber.

## Abstract
A self cleaning apparatus 10 for the monitoring of pH in an effluent process stream 17 includes a sump pump 16 for sampling the effluent process stream 17 , a housing 12 for supporting a pH electrode 13 , and a cleansing assembly 15 for automatically cleansing the pH electrode 13 entirely powered by the impingement of the fluid process stream 17 upon the cleansing assembly 15 . The housing 12 includes an electrode chamber 14 into which the pH electrode 13 extends. The electrode chamber 14 receives the effluent process stream 17 sample from the sump pump 16 and is also automatically, continuously cleansed by the cleansing assembly 15 .
