# FUEL COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A fuel composition is prepared from a friable solid fuel, e.g. coal, and a crude oil. The solid fuel is ground in the crude oil until the mean particle size of the solid fuel particles is reduced to a value in the range 1 to 10 micron and the composition contains 30 to 60 by weight of the solid fuel. Air is excluded during the grinding operation. The composi tion is suitable for use as a liquid fuel for industrial burners.
