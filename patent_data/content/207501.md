# An automatic aspirator transfer valve, and a jet washing apparatus comprising such a valve.

## Abstract
In an automatic aspirator transfer valve controlling the delivery of washing fluid from a supply M to a cleaning gun B and having a valving piston 2 movable between a first or rinsing position, in which it opens bypass con duits 15 bypassing an injector 3,21,4 and a second or washing position in which it closes said bypass conduit 15 and enables the injector 3,21,4 to aspi rate washing fluid from a reservoir not shown through a non return valve 11 , a side inlet 5 and a conduit 22 to its side inlet 21 , the novel aspect is that the side inlet conduit 22 is separated from the space within the housing bore 20 , in which the valving piston 2 can slide. In this manner it is avoided that a portion of the washing agent may fill the space within the housing bore 20 and leave the valve in the form of a plug when changing from the washing mode Bottom Figure to the rinsing mode , thus avoiding both the issuing of dangerously high concentrations and unnecessary waste of washing agent.
