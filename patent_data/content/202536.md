# Signal processing circuit for a color video printer.

## Abstract
A signal processing circuit for a color video printer according to the present invention comprises first and second memories 302,202 , data interpolation circuit 401 and printer. The first memory 302 stores a color signal which requires the largest amount of information among signals of three primary colors in a video signal. The second memory 303 stores the other two color signals sampled alternately. The data interpolation circuit 401 reproduces the color signals of lacking parts by the use of the color signals stored in the second memory 303 . The color signals delivered from the first memory 302 or the data interpolation circuit 401 are successively sent to the printer so as to be printed.
