# Data Format converter.

## Abstract
The conversion of bit interleaved to byte interleaved data is achieved using a memory 11 and a universal shift register 14 . The period of each bit interleaved timeslot is divided into three parts for which corresponding timing signals are pro vided. During the first timing signal, the content of a memory location corresponding to an output channel is loaded into the universal shift register 14 . During the second timing signal, the incoming bit associated with the timeslot is shifted serially into the register 14 and during the third signal, the content of the register 14 is returned to its original location in the memo ry 11 . After a frame of bit interleaved data has been received at the register 14 , the memory 11 contains the correspond ing frame of byte interleaved data.
