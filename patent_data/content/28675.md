Although various types of demodulators are known in the art, none are caPable of operating directly on signals having frequencies ranging from the audio into the gigaHertz GHz range. Those UHF and SHF demodulators which do exist are fairly complex, and there are limits in the type of appilcations in which such devices can be used.

Although various applications of CCD circuits to high frequency signal processing is known e.g., U.S. Patent Mu bers 4,152,60s and 4,159,430 , it was not known in the prior art to directly apply the fill and spill input circuit to RF signals. Moreover, there was no teaching to such prior art about the desirability of using CCD technology in radio frequency circuit applications. Summary Briefly, and in general terms, the invention is concerned with phase or amplitude demodulator circuits, and in particular with broad spectrum demodulators capable of operating in the frequency range from audio frequencies up to the high gigaHertz frequency range, i.e. 100 GHz or more . The invention is moreover concerned with a semiconductor integrated circuit utilizing charge couple device technology for providing such a demodulator.

Description of the Preferred Embodiment Turning now to FIG. 1, there is shown a highly simplified block diagram of the demodulator system according to the present invention.A source of a modulated time varying signal, such as a radio frequency RF source is designated by block labeled 10. A clock circuit designated by block labeled 11 provides three non overlapping clock signals 1 2 and 3. Such clock signals are applied to the CCD demodulator circuit 12 according to the present invention. The output signal is amplified by an amplifier 13 which provides a demodulated signal of the phase or amplitude modulated time varying signal according to the present invention. Turning now to FIG. 2, there is shown a top view of a semiconductor implementation of the CCD demodulator according to the present invention.A monocrystalline silicon semiconductor substrate 40, typically of p type conductivity, supports the CCD demodulator 12 and the amplifier 13 as shown in FIG. 1. In the preferred embodiment according to the present invention, p type silicon substrate with CCD and MOSFET devices are described, however it must be realized that other semiconductor materials, or other circuits and transistor devices may be used as well. FIG. 2 in particular shows a first semiconductor region 14 of second conductivity type e.g. n type forming a surface region on the semiconductor substrate 40. Formed within the first region 14 are first and second discrete, spaced apart surface subregions 41 and 42 respectively also of n type conductivity but having a dopant concentration higher than that of the region 14. An insulating layer not shown lies over the surface regions, except for contact areas which make external electrical connection with active semiconductor regions possible. A contact 17 makes electrical and physical contact with the first semiconductor region 41 for the purpose of supplying an input signal thereto.The contact 17 is connected to an input line 16 which is formed by an aluminum or polysilicon layer or strip overlying the insulating layer which is formed on the major surface of the semiconductor substrate 40. The second semiconductor region 42 also includes a contact 45 which makes physical and electrical contact therewith. A corresponding aluminum layer or strip 31 makes electrical connection with the contact 45 and extends over the insulating layer on the surface of the semiconductor substrate 40. Three gate electrodes 19, 22, and 25 are provided overlying and electrically insulated from the major surface of the semiconductor substrate and disposed between the semiconductor regions 41 and 42. Gate electrodes 19 and 25 are first or lower level polysilicon gates and gate 22 is a second or upper level polysilicon gate which slightly overlies a portion of both gates 19 and 25. These gates are separated from the major surface of the semiconductor wafer and from each other by means of the insulating layer not shown . Various signal lines are provided which make electrical contact with the gate electrodes. The signal line 18 makes contact with the gate electrode 19 at the contact 20. The gate associated with gate electrode 19 may also be referred to as the t meter gate , or gate G1. The signal line 21 makes contact with the gate electrode 22 by means of the contact 23. The gate associated with gate electrode 22 may be referred to as the storage gate , or gate G2. The signal line 24 makes contact with the gate electrode 25 at the contact 26. The gate associated with gate electrode 25 may be referred to as the output transfer gate, or gate OTG.The signal lines 18, 21, and 24 are preferably conductive strips composed of aluminum and are disposed on the surface of the insulating layer over the semiconductor substrate. FIG. 2 also shows the amplifier portion 13 of the circuit according to the present invention including a second semiconductor region 15 of a second conductivity type i.e. n type adjacent the major surface and extends from the surface to a predetermined depth into a body. The second semiconductor region 15 is spaced from the first semiconductor region 14 and electrically isolated therefrom by the substrate 40. This second semiconductor region of second conductivity type further contains first and second spaced apart semiconductor subregions 43 and 44 respectively of the same second conductivity type adjacent said major surface. The first and second subregions have a second conductivity type forming dopant concentration higher than that of the second semiconductor region itself, such as having n type conductivity.Such first and second subregions form the source and drain zones of a field effect transistor which is used as an amplifier for the output signal generated in the present circuit. A first signal line 32 is physically and electrically connected to the first subregion 43 by means of the contact 33. A second signal line 34 makes physical and electrical contact with the second subregion 44 by means of the contact 35. The source and drain electrodes may therefore be connected to other elements of the circuit in order to further amplify or utilize the signal, as is known by those skilled in the art. FIG. 2 also shows the reset means according to the present invention.The reset means is formed by a field effect transistor, including a reset gate electrode 47 and a third semiconductor subregion 46 which is adjacent the major surface of the semiconductor body and lies within the first semiconductor region 14 described above. The third subregion 46 has a second conductivity type forming dopant concentration higher than that of the second semiconductor region itself, such as having n type conductivity, and is spaced apart from the second subregion 42 so that the regions 42 and 46, together with the gate electrode 47 form a field effect transistor.The reset gate electrode 47 is composed preferably of polysilicon and is disposed on the insulating layer not shown which lies over the semiconductor structure, and is situated so that its projection normal to the surface of the substrate 40 lies between the second and third subregions 42 and 46 so as to form an insulated gate of a field effect transistor having the source and drain zones constituted by the second and third subregions 42 and 46 respectively. A signal line 48 makes contact with the gate electrode 47 at a contact 49. A signal known as a reset gate RG signal is applied during a third subsequent time interval for the purpose of making the field effect transistor constituted by the subregions 42 and 46 and gate electrode 47 conductive so as to drain the charge located on the output gate 31 at an appropriate time, thereby resetting the storage gate to receive further charge from the input. A signal line 50 is further provided which makes contact with the second subregion 46 at the contact 51, which functions to DC bias the amplifier gate during reset. FIG. 3a is a cross sectional view of the semiconductor circuit shown in FIG. 2 through the Ill Ill plane. FIG. 3b shows a sequence potential diagram of the electrical potential in the semiconductor body adjacent the major surface in a region corresponding to the region shown in FIG. 3a at successive periods of time. The elements shown in FIG. 3 and labeled by reference numerals have the same meaning as the corresponding. elements inFIG. 2, e.g. the input line 16, contact 17, semiconductor body 40, first semiconductor region 14 and second semiconductor region 15, first semiconductor subregion 41 and second semiconductor subregion 42, the third semiconductor subregion 44, gate electrodes 19, 22, and 25, output line 31 and contact 45.FIG. 3a shows the layer of electrically insulating material 52, preferably silicon dioxide, which overlies the major surfaces of the semiconductor body 40 and the semiconductor regions, and electrically insulates the gate electrodes 19, 22, and 25 from the silicon surface, as well as insulates the gate electrode 31 from the surface of the second semiconductor region 15. The potential diagrams in FIG. 3b in particular indicate the potential level under gate 19 orG1 , under gate 22 orG2 , and under the gate 25 or the output transfer gate OTG . According to the present invention the ratio frequency input signal is applied to Gate G1, a fixed bias potential is applied to gate G2, and the clock pulse 2 as will be described subsequently, is applied to the output transfer gate 25. In the sequence of potential diagrams shown in FIG. 3b, a pulse does not appear on the output transfer gate and thus the potential under the semiconductor region under that gate remains constant during the time period considered. FIG. 3b shows a sequence of four potential well diagrams taken at successive time interval ton tl, t2, and t3, and two further potential well diagrams at a much later time during subsequent time intervals tN and tN 1. During the period of time from to to t3 the potential barrier under the gate G is seen to decrease from the period to to t1 and increase from the period t2 to t3. During this time period the stored charge in the region under the gate G2 slowly begins to diffuse in tne left hand direction. At time to the potential underneath the gate G1 is at a potential level V 1, and at the time t1 the potential under the gate G1 is at a lower level. The level IN is the initial input voltage applied the charge storage areas by means of the input line 16. The shaded portion represents charge storage in the semiconductor region between the subregions 41 and 42. The first of the six potential diagrams at t t0 shows the G2 gate storage charge equilibrated to the DC bias on the G1 gate. Actually, this DC signal equilibration occurs simultaneously with the RF signal, but the superposition principle allows one to treat them separately. At t t1, the first positive half cycle of the RF signal voltage applied to gate G1 begins exposing the stored charge to a lower potential. This half cycle concludes at t t3. The third potential diagram represents the situation at t t3, just before the half cycle conclusion. At this point, a small amount of charge has spilled out of the storage well, but the effective pulse width is so short at millimeter wave frequencies that very little charge transfer has occurred.Nevertheless, a charge diffusion pattern is emerging that can be divided into three parts denoted by the arrows 1 3. Arrow 1 is a slow diffusion of charge under the G1 gate andG2 has a slow diffusion component labeled by arrow 2. These two diffusion components proceed independent of the sinewave cycle through an application of the superposition principle. A third component labeled by arrow 3 represents a fast charge transfer occurring at the gate boundary. In the fourth diagram at t t3 the polarity of the RF signal has changed, raising the G1 gate potential. This in turn raises the G1 charge potential so that charge at the G1 boundary flows back to the G2 well. This charge diffusion is denoted by arrow 3 . The net result is the two opposite fast diffusions, 3 and 3 , cancel during an RF cycle while the slow diffusions continue without interruption.A cycle that occurs around t tN and tN 1 n 1 , a much later time, is illustrated in the final two diagrams. Here it is seen that the slow diffusion has resulted in a cosine profile for the exposed excess charge originally in the G2 well. Since the fast diffusion alternates direction giving no net tranfer, and the superposition principle holds in this linear system, it is justified to neglect the fast diffusion and treat just the slow diffusion. The time allowed for the slow diffusion is the total time between the 01 input diffusion pulse and the 2 output transfer gate pulse which can be 1 us or longer. This is plenty of time to spili the excess charge and equilibrate the 62 stored charge to the G1 potential minimum determined by the RF signal amplitude. FIG. 4 is a timingdiagram of the signal waveforms applied to the gates of the semiconductor device according to the present invention. The first timing signal is the timing signal applied to the input diffusion line 16 and is labeled 1 in FIG. 4 as well as in FIG. 1. The signal 1 remains essentially high or at ground potential until a time tA at which point it drops to a relatively negative potential where it remains for a predetermined time as short as a few nanoseconds. After such period has elapsed, at t the signal returns to ground potential where it remains until the cycle is continued.Such a signal occurs during a first time interval and functions to inject charge into the charge storage region thereby filling the storage well under the gate G2 to a level determined purely by the height of the potential well under the level G1. This is represented on the FIG. 3 by time to in which the storage well under the gate G2 has been filled exactly to the height of the signal applied to the gate G1. This initiates the sample aperture which ends when the output transfer gate is pulsed. The 2 signal shown in FIG. 5 applied to the output transfer gate is defined by a waveform going from a relatively negative voltage level to a relatively positive level for a time internval of at least 100 ns. for a typical 6 um gate dimension. The function of the output transfer gate signal is to transfer the charge stored in the region underneath G2 into the semiconductor region 42 and thence onto the gate 31. The final third timing diagram shown in FIG. 5 is the 03 signal applied to the reset gate RG which in FIG. 1 is the gate 47. The waveform changes from a relatively low voltage to a relatively high voltage, and remains at the relatively high voltage for a period of at least 100 ns. which occurs during a third time interval subsequent to the second and the first time interval. Following the sequence of consecutive pulses associated with wave forms 013 2 ,,and 3 respectively, the cycle repeats itself with a pulse as is shown in the diagram in FIG. 4. The output proportional to the RF signal amplitude appears as a pulse at the output FET source line 32 in the time between the 2 and 3 pulses. FIG. 5 is a timing diagram of the operation of the present invention in demodulating the applied radio frequency signal. The FIGURE s first waveform shows the typical amplitude modulated radio frequency signal that might be applied to the G1 gate. The second waveform shown is the sample pulse or the 1 waveform. The third shows the output waveform produced by the present invention having as an input the radio frequency input signal shown in FIG. 4. The output signal represents the demodulation of the radio frequency signal shown above in FIG. 4. The output signal shown in FIG. 4 is produced by a voltage or current variation of a signal in the conduction path of the field effect transistor defined by 43, 31, and 44 in FIG. 2. FIG. 6 is a highly simplified block diagram of an applic bion of aCCD demodulator according to the present invention as a phase meter, which functions to distinguish the phase of two applied signals. Alternatively, the present invention may be used in performing detection of a phase modulated signal, in which case one of the signals applied to the demodulator is a reference signal having a known phase. The signals S1 and S2 are applied to two diode switches 60 and 61 respectively. As an example of two different signals of different amplitude and phase, signal S1 is represented as being of the form A sin wt and signal S2 is represented as being of the form B sin t , whereA and B are constants, is frequency and t is time. Each of the diode switches have two possible positions, either an on state or an off state. Control of the diode switches is performed by the timing and bias circuit 63.In one modulation period, the diode switches go through each of the four possible combination of positions diode switch 60 on, diode switch 61 on diode switch 60 on, diode switch 61 off diode switch 60 off, diode switch 61 on diode switch 60 off, diode switch 61 offThe selection of the positions of the diode switches is performed by the timing and bias circuit 63 in a predetermined order so that in four equal and successive time intervals, each position is selected. The output of the two diode switches are applied to the gates G1 and G2 of the CCD demodulator as shown in FIG. 3a. The output of the CCD demodulator which is now labeled as a CCD phase meter and detector in block 62, takes one of A our possible values depending upon the settings of the diode switches 61 and 62. The four possible output values Q are shown above the output line by C A QB 5 QCS cos and QC QB The value QC is defined as the voltage output of the demodulator 62 when no time varying signal is applied to the input gates i.e. a DC bias signal is alone applied to the gates . QA is a voltage proportional to the input amplutude A, and a voltage proportional to the input amplitude B. Which of these Q values are output by the demodulator 62 is determined according to the settings of the diode switches 61 and 62 at a specific time as is shown in FIG. 7.Note that when both AC signals are applied to demodulator 62 i.e. A sin wt and B sin ut the output has a term proportional to cos , where is the phase difference. The output of the CCD phase meter 62 is an analog signal which may preferably be converted to a digital signal for further processing. The analog output signal is therefore applied to a conventional AID converter 64 which converts the analog output from the CCD output gate to adigital signal for such further processing. The output of the AID converter 64 is shown as an 8 bit data output line applied to a microprocessor 65. The timing and bias circuit 63 provides timing and bias signals to the A D converter 64 as well as the microprocessor 65. The four ouzput values for Q for one modulation period are used in the microprocessor 65 to calculate in real time the amplitudes of the two applied signals and their phase difference.The phase difference may be calculated for each modulation period by use of the formula cos 1 Q QC QA QB The specific choice of a microprocessor and the programming thereof for use in the described application would be within the skill of a person familiar with the programming art. Temperature and bias drift are accounted for by the QC output. Signal amplitude variations are accounted for by the QC QA and QC Qss outputs. One important application for the present invention as a phase meter is in a data transmission system for sending digital data between a transmitter and a receiver over a transmission line, in which predetermined phase differences and predetermined amplitude levels are established in a carrier signal during successive modulation periods representative of preselected data combinations. The demodulator at the receiver according to the present invention functions to detect the phase differences and the amplitude levels and restore the digital data to its original format. In such an application the phase and amplitude modulated carrier signal is applied to the input of one of the diode switches, e.g. diode switch 60, and a reference signal applied to the other diode switch, e,g. diode switch 61. The diode switches 60 and 61 are then sequent ially switched on and off by the timing and bias circuit 63 so that the four possible output signals are generated. As explained above, the output signals are applied to the AID converter 64 to produce digital signals which are applied to the microprocessor 65. The microprocessor produces a multibit digital output representing the phase difference between the input signal and the reference signal FIG. 8 is a potential diagram of the potential in the semiconductor body under the gates G1, G2, and the output transfer gate under various conditions.Each of the levels of potential shown in the diagram of FIG. 8 are labeled according to the potential which has been applied to the gate and therefore which is reflected in the potential level in the semiconductor body under the respective gate. The minimum difference in levels between gates G1 to G2 is represented by the arrows shown on the right hand portion of the figure and is proportional to the device output. These different signals are as follows is isthe difference between the DC meter gate and storage gate potentials and is propor tional to the DC output. is isthe difference between the DC storage gate potential and the minimum AC modulated meter gate potential and is proportional to the AC signal amplitude, A, and the DC AC amplitude output. is isthe difference between the DC meter gate potential and the maximum AC modulated storage gate potential and is proportional to the AC signal amplitude, B, and the DC AC amplitude output. QC QA QB COS 8 at an angle 180 is the difference between the minimum AC modulated meter gate potential and the maximum AC stoage gate potential or Qc QA QB and is proportional to the device output. QC QA QB COS at an angle 0 is the difference between the minimum AC modulated meter gate potential and the minimum AC storage gate potential or QA QB and is proportional to the device output. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the semiconductor device according to the present invention can be manufactured with various semiconductor technologies and different combinations of known process steps, and that the preferred embodiments illustrated here are merely exemplary. The depth of penetration of the various zones and regions and in particular the configuration and distance between the active zones of the transistor devices, as well as the concentrations of dopant species, and or their concentration profiles, can be chosen depending upon the desired properties. These and other variations can be further elaborated by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention. The present invention is also not restricted to the specific semiconductor materials and circuits described. For example, it may be pointed out that seriiconductor materials other than silicon, for example Ai11 Bv compounds, may be used. Furthermore, the conductivity types in the embodiment may be interchanged and corresponding to such change, the polarity of the respective operating voltages adapted. Moreover, the voltage level and the static or dynamic nature of the signals applied to the various terminals and gates of the device, as well as the voltage sources, may be suitably selected as desired for a particular application. While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in a CCD Demodulator Circuit, it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention. Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standl oint of prior art, fairly constitutes essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention, and, therefore, such adaptations should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalence of the following claims that is cl imed is
