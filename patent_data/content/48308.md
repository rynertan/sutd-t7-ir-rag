## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING PROPYLENE TET RAFLUOROETHYLENE COPOLYMER The present invention relates to a process for producing a propylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer.More particularly, it relates to a novel process for producing the propylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer by copolymerizing propylene and tetrafluoroethylene in an aqueous medium in the presence of a specific redox catalyst to attain smooth copolymerization at high polymerization velocity without discoloring the latex or the copolymer and with high storage stability of the latex. Propylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymers are known as vulcanizable elastic polymers having excellent heat resistance and chemical resistance. The copolymerization of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene in an aqueous medium has been disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent PublicationNo. 19188 1965, No. 4115 1978 and U.S. Patent 3,467,635.It has also been proposed that a propylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer having high molecular weight can be obtained by copolymerization at a relatively low temperature such as 0 to 50 0C if a redox catalyst comprising a water soluble persulfate a water soluble thiosulfate or sulfite a water soluble iron salt as a catalyst for the copolymerization in an aqueous medium, as disclosed in British Patent No. 1,456,615. On the other hand, many redox catalysts for emulsion polymerization at relatively low temperatures have been reported from long time ago. Sometimes catalytic activity is specifically dependent upon a combination of the redox catalyst with a particular monomer. The limitation for the selection is more severe in the case of multi component copolymerization and is related to various factors such as reactivity of the monomer, efficiency of initiation, chain transfer, kinetic chain length, pH of the medium and the stabilities of the monomer and the catalyst. Therefore, it is not eas to find an optimum redox catalyst for a specific polymerization system.In the case of a copolymerization system having high chain transfer activity and short kinetic chain length such as a copolymerization of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene, the selection of an optimum redox catalyst is especially difficult. For example, most catalysts having high catalytic activity for emulsion polymerizations of tetrafluoroethylene at low temperature are not active for copolymerizations of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene at low temperature. According to the inventor s studies, the specific redox catalysts disclosed in British Patent No. 1,456,615 are active for the copolymerization of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene at a low temperature, but copolymerizations at a low temperature with such catalysts have the following disadvantages. First, the copolymerization velocity is not high enough, the maximum being about 17 g. l.hr. The discoloring dark coloring of the latex and the polymer is remarkably severe even when lengthy and complicated washing and purification steps are employed because of the use of an activating solution containing a reducing sugar. Moreover, the COD of the waste solution in the coagulation of the latex and the washing is remarkably high, which renders the treatment of the waste solution difficult.Furthermore, the storage stability of the latex is not high enough and sedimentation and separation with long storage of the latex. The reducing sugar is perishable and causes discoloring and an unpleasant odour. The preparation of the activated solution is complicated and the activated solution is immediately inactivated by contact with oxygen in air. Therefore, the preparation is not easy and the catalytic activity is not stable. It is an object of the present invention to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages in a copolymerization of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene at a low temperature in an aqueous medium. The present invention provides a process for producing a propylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer which comprises copolymerizing propylene and tetrafluoroethylene in an aqueous medium in the presence of a redox catalyst of comprising 1 a water soluble persulfate and 2 a water soluble iron salt characterised in that the catalyst also includes 3 a hydroxymethanesulfinate and 4 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or a salt thereof and the copolymerization is carried out at pH 7 to 10.5. The inventors have studied the copolymerization of propylene and tetrafluoroethylene in an aqueous medium at a low temperature, which had not hitherto been easily carried out, so as to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages in the process. As a result, it has been found that the specific redox catalyst of the combination of 1 a water soluble persulfate, 2 a water soluble iron salt, 3 a hydroxymethanesulfinate and 4 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or a salt thereof EDTA is effective for this purpose and the specific redox catalyst has high catalytic activity in an alkaline aqueous solution at pH of up to 10.5. Using the process of the present invention, it is possible to copolymerize propylene and tetrafluoroethylene at high copolymerization velocity in an aqueous medium. thus, the copolymerization can be smoothly performed at a low temperature, suitably lower than 400C and a propylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer of high molecular weight can be obtained. In the process of the present invention, smooth copolymerization in an aqueous medium is attained and the stability of the resulting latex is excellent. Coloring of the latex and the polymer is not found and the COD of the waste solution can be remarkably reduced. The copolymerization can be continued for a long time by continuously adding the hydrixymethanesulfinate as a reducing agent. The copolymerization velocity can be controlled as desired for example by adjusting the amount of the hydroxymethanesulfinate. In the process of the present invention, the molar ratio of C2F4 C3H6 in the reaction system is not critical and can be varied within a broad range, it is usually in a range of 95 5 to 20 80. In the process of the present invention, when the content of C 2F4 is larger, the copolymerization velocity is faster and the copolymer having high molecular weight is effectively produced. Therefore, the molar ratio of C2F4 C3H6 is preferably 95 5 to 40 60 especially 93 7 to 70 30. In the process of the present invention, it is possible to copolymerize C 2F4 and C 3116 as the major components with one or more other coinonomers, which make a multi component polymer for the proper object by selecting the molar ratios. In the process of the present invention, various components for the specific redox catalyst can be used. Suitable water soluble per sulfates as the first component include ammonium or alkali metal salts such as ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate and sodium persulfate. Suitable water soluble iron salts as the second component include divalent or trivalent iron salts such as ferrous sulfate, ferric sulfate, ferrous nitrate, ferric nitrate, ferrous chloride, ferric chloride, ammonium ferrous sulfate, and ammonium ferric sulfate. The ferric or ferrous sulfate is especially preferable as the second component. The first and second components are combined with a hydroxymethanesulfinate referring to as HMSA such as CH2 OH SO2Na and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or a salt thereof referring to EDTA . EDTA is preferably sodium salt and, the other salts or hydrate or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid itself can be used. HMSA is preferably an alkali metal salt such as sodium or potassium salt thereof. It is possible to be a hydrate thereof or to contain a small amount of hydroxymethanesulfonate. The ratios of the components of the specific redox catalyst used in the present invention can be selected as desired. The following facts are found. With regard to the copolymerization velocity depending on the catalytic component content, the water soluble persulfate content causes low influence, but the iron ion content and HMSA content cause relatively high influence.EDTA has high chelate forming stability with iron ion and EDTA is used for resulting effective iron ion concentration as the catalytic component. Therefore, EDTA is incorporated at an equivalent concentration to the iron ion concentration in the optimum condition. In usual, the water soluble per sulfate is incorporated at a concentration of 1 to 50 m mol liter the water soluble iron salt and iEDTA are respectively incorporated at each concentration of 0. 05 to 5 m mol liter and HMSA is incorporated at a concentration of 0. 5 to 50 m mol liter in the aqueous medium. When the concentrations of the water soluble iron salt and EDTA are set in relatively high level, the concentration of HMSA can be set in relatively low level, and vice versa. In order to give a desired copolymerization velocity, the concentrations of the components can be controlled as desired. The specific redox catalyst used in the present invention is usually used at a concentration of 0. 001 to 5 wt. t0 preferably 0. 01 to 2 wt. based on the aqueous medium. The content of the specific redox catalyst can be greater than the range, and there is tendency to decrease the molecular weight of the resulting copolymer and it is economically disadvantageous. It is preferably to select the concentration from said range. The copolymerization is usually carried out at a relatively low temperature such as 0 to 50 C. If a reaction temperature is too high, the molecular weight of the resulting copolymer is lowering and the decomposing velocity of the catalyst is too fast and accordingly, the efficiency is lower. If a reaction temperature is too low, the copolymerization velocity is too low to attain a practical operation.The reaction temperature is preferably in a range of about 5 to 45 C especially about 10 to 40 C. The pH dependency of the copolymerization velocity is high as the characteristic of the copolymerization of the present invention. Thus, pH is preferably in a range of 7 to 10. 5, especially 8 to 10. 5. If pH is out of the range, the copolymerization velocity is lower. If pH is higher than 10. 5, the copolymerization velocity is especially lower. In the process of the present invention, the other condition for the copolymerization is not critical and it is possible to employ a batch operation or a continuous operation under stirring. The pressure in the copolmerization is not critical and is usually less than 100 kg. cmê gauge , preferably in a range of 5 to 80 kg. cmê gauge , especially 10 to 50 kg. cm2 gauge . In the process of the present invention, it is possible to use various additives which are used in the similar copolymerizations in an aqueous medium. For example, an emulsifier required for an emulsion polymerization can be used. Suitable emulsifiers include conventional polyfluoro or polyfluorochloro alkyl type emulsifiers such as water soluble salts of polyfluoroaliphatic carboxylic acids and perfluoroaliphatic carboxylic acids and water soluble salts of polyfluorochloroaliphatic carboxylic acids or perfluorochloroaliphatic carboxylic acids and phosphates or sulfates of polyfluoroalcohols. It is also possible to use nonfluorinated emulsifiers such as sulfates of higher fatty alcohol or water soluble salts of aromatic sulfonic acids. A mixture of the emulsifiers can be used. The emulsifier is usually used at a concentration of about 0.0001 to 10 wt. preferably about 0.001 to 5 wit. based on the aqueous medium.It is also possible to incorporate a dispersion stabilizer such as trifluorotrichloroethane, liquid chlorinated hydrocarbons, liquid saturated hydrocarbons, and a pH regulator, a buffering agent, an accelerator, and a chain transfer agent. In the present invention, it is preferable to carry out the copolymerization in a weak alkaline condition pH of about 9 to 10 in view of copolymerization velocity. It is suitable to incorporate a pH regulator such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide and others, and a buffering agent such as sodium hydrogenphosphate, sodium borate and others.It is possible to incorporate a water soluble organic solvent such as methanol, tert butanol, and methyl acetate so as to increase the copolymerization velocity In accordance with the process of the present invention, the product is obtained in a form of a dispersion such as an emulsion dispersing the propylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer in an aqueous medium. The propylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer having elasticity can be easily separated from such dispersion by a conventional manner or a well known manner. It is possible to use the product in the form of a dispersion or a concentrated dispersion, in an operation for fabrication. The resulting copolymers have advantages of less discoloring and excellent electric properties, chemical resistance, heat resistance and mechanical resistance. These can be used for various usages in view of these characteristics. The present invention will be illustrated by certain examples and references which are provided for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting the present invention.
