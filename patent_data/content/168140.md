# PURIFICATION APPARATUS AND METHOD EMPLOYING A REGENERABLE LIGAND

## Abstract
A fluid stream is purified using a regenerable ligand to remove a ligate from the stream. The ligand 12 is immobil ized on a semi permeable membrane 16 . The fluid stream 11 is conducted along this membrane 16 which is such that there is not transport of fluid across the membrane 16 . Subsequently in a regeneration step a regeneration agent 18 is supplied, which acts to remove the ligate 14 from the ligand 12 . This agent 14 is supplied from the reverse side of the membrane 16 under conditions such that it diffuses across the membrane. The resulting ligate laden fluid is then rinsed out. The membrane may be configured as a sheet or as a hollow fibre. The ligand may be an antigen, serving to remove an antibody from blood plasma as the fluid stream.
