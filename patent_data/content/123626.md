# Method and apparatus for simulating aural response information.

## Abstract
Speech and like signals are analysed based on a model of the function of the human hearing system. The model of the inner ear is expressed as signal processing operations which map acoustic signals into neural representations. Specifically, a high order transfer function is modeled as a cascade paral lel filterbank network of simple linear, time invariant second order filter sections. Signal transduction and com pression are based on a half wave rectification with a non linearly coupled, variable time constant automatic gain con trol network. The result is a simple device which simulates the complex signal transfer function associated with the human ear. The invention lends itself to implementation in digital circuitry for real time or near real time processing of speech and other sounds.
