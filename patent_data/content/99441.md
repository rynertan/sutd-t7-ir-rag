# Apparatus for recovery of heat from fumes in a heating system or from the ambient air.

## Abstract
The apparatus includes a condenser 4 , through which passes a duct 3 that carries, downward, the fumes from heating boiler 1 to bring them into a lower chamber 5 . The fumes are mixed with ambient air in this chamber 5 , a mixture that is then moved upward, going through the evaporator 4 by the action of a fan 9 , placed contiguous to the collection chamber 10 , placed above the evaporator 4 . Together with the recovery of heat from the fumes there is a recovery of the heat contained in the ambient air. Besides the high efficiency that can be obtained with a limited capital investment, in the case of fumes the appar atus purifies them of the solid particles in suspension and even noxious gaseous components. The apparatus is used independently of the hot gas, for example, to heat water for domestic use. The air that is exhausted by the fan 9 after having given up its heat inside the evaporator 4 can be used for conditioning a closed area.
