# Method and apparatus for aiding the operation of a crane.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a crane operating aid for a crane having a boom 22 which is luffed by a plurality of hydraulic lift rams 32 . each ram having a lower or high pressure chamber 41 and an upper or lower pressure chamber 39 , the upper chambers 39 of all the rams 32 being intercon nected. The crane operating aid comprises a plurality of sen sors 56R, 56L responsive to the pressures in the respective lower chambers 41 of the rams 32 , and a single sensor 56U responsive to the pressure in the upper chambers 39 . The crane operating aid also has logic means responsive to the signals from the sensors 56R,56L,56U for determining the boom reaction forces, preferably by averaging the pres sures in the lower chambers 41 and taking the difference between the average and the pressures in the upper cham bers 39 . The logic means can be a load moment computer, which may also be responsive to transducers which monitor, for example, boom length and boom angle. The boom reac tion forces can be used to determine the total effective crane load, which can be displayed on a console. The console can also display the percentage of a load capacity as a function of the crane manufacturer s published load rating tables.
