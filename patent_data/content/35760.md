# Thermosetting resin composition, process for preparation thereof and cured product thereof.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a thermosetting resin composition, a process for the preparation of this composi tion and a cured product obtained by heating and curing this composition. Both the thermosetting resin composition and cured product of the present invention comprise tri allylisocyanurate TAIC and a poly phenylmethylene polymaleimide represented by the following general formula This composition is obtained by heating and dissolving the polymaleimide into TAIC. According to the intended use of the molded product, various additives may be added to the composition. For example, there may be added a radical polymerizable thermosetting resin such as an unsaturated polyester, an epoxy acrylate resin or a diallyl phthalate pre polymer and a filler represented by a thermoplastic resin. The composition of the present invention is excellent in the com patability and therefore, a good moldability is obtained at the molding step. Furthermore, the cured product of the present invention is excellent in the mechanical properties, electric properties and heat resistance.
