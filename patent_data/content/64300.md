# Method for curing particulate arylene sulfide polymer.

## Abstract
A method for curing particulate arylene sulfide polymer in which the particulate polymer is preheated from ambient temperature to a skin temperature within the range of about 230 to about 260 C by agitating the particulate polymer in a polisher apparatus 7 , transferring the preheated particles to a curing vessel 21a,b,c,d , and further heating the preheated particulate polymer in the curing vessel 21a,b,c, d for a time and at a temperature to produce cured polymer having a pre selected melt flow range. Preferably, preheating is carried out continuously with the heated polymer delivered to alternative curing vessels 21a,b,c,d wherein the curing is carried out batch wise.
