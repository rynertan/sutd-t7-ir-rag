# Sampling device for molten metals.

## Abstract
Sampling device for liquid metals, which device contains a pipe 5 and a head 1 fixed on an end thereof, wherein a sam pling chamber 11 is formed, which head 1 contains a part 2 of fireproof material which partially limits the sampling chamber 11 , which is provided with a supply orifice 12 46 to the sampling chamber and which is put in the pipe 5 with a narrow end 3 in such a way that the sampling chamber 11 is located entirely outside of the pipe 5 and at least one small cooling plate 9 forming at least a part of the wall of the sam pling chamber 11 and thus also limits this sampling chamber, characterized in that the part 2 is made of a material that at least during the sampling offers a structure letting gas pass.
