# YIELDABLY MOUNTED LUBRICANT CONTROL ASSEMBLIES FOR PISTON RODS

## Abstract
Improved lubricant control assemblies for reciprocating piston rods of an engine which prevent crankcase lubricant intruding into the cylinders and fluid from the cylinders from escaping into the crankcase. Each assembly comprises a tubular scraper fitting closely onto a piston rod and yieldably mounted within the bore between cylinder and crankcase through which the piston rod extends. The yieldable mounting is by means of a compliant housing. The compliant housing allows the scraper to be displaced radially and thereby follow limited radial displace ment of the piston rod while maintaining substantially full effec tiveness of the scraper s action on the reciprocating piston rod. The scraper is urged into forceful contact around the piston rod by means of a crown spring which is supported on a tubular part which attaches to the compliant housing. The compliant housing comprises an outer ring portion which is threaded into the bore to mount the assembly on the engine and an inner ring portion which attaches to the tubular part. One or more intermediate ring portions may be included in the compliant housing. Each ring portion joins to its immediate ring portion s at only one axial end with the points of joining alternating axially from each ring to the next. A disclosed embodiment for the compliant housing com prises a one piece nylon part.
