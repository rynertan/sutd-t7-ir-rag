# System for externally treating the blood.

## Abstract
A system is disclosed for treating blood, with the objective of reducing the functioning population of a blood constituent. According to the method, blood is passed through an ultraviolet radiation field in the presence of a dissolved photoactive agent capable of forming photo adducts with receptors on the constituent to effect covalent bonding between the photoactive agent and the same. If desired, the blood to be treated may be separated to provide a blood fraction rich in the constituent sought to be reacted and low in any blood component which absorbs UV radiation, as for example by continuous centrifuging, which fraction is then irradiated with UV radiation in the presence of the dissolved photoactive chemical agent.
