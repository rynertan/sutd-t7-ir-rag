# Sheet feeding apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus having a track 14, 16 for guiding a sheet 18 therealong and transport means 30, 32, 36, 46 for feeding a sheet 18 along the track 14, 16 . The transport means includes a rotatable member 36 having a shaft 38 mounted for rotation, with the rotatable member 36 having a driving periphery extending into the track 14, 16 . The transport means also includes a coupling unit 46 rotatably mounted in a support member 48 at the track 14, 16 and having an expansible periphery 50 . Also provided are actuating means 102, 89, 94 including an endless coiled spring 94 expansible by an actuator 90 for selectively moving the expansible periphery 50 between a first position in which the expansible periphery 50 is uncoupled from the driving periphery of the rotatable member 36 , and a second position in which the expansible periphery 50 is expanded to form a driving coupling with the driving periphery of the rotatable member 36 to feed a sheet 18 positioned therebetween along the track 14, 16 when the rotatable member 36 is rotated.
