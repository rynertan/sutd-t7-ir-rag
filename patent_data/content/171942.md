## Description
Antitumor Composition This invention relates to an antitumor composition containing a 5 fluorohexahydropyrirnidine and a pyrimidine nucleic acid base and or the riboside thereof. 5 Fluorouracil is an antitumor agent synthesized by Duschinsky J.Amer.Chem.Soc. 79,4559 1957 . Basic and clinical investigations or the same as an antitumor antimetabolite by Heidelberger et al. Nature 179,663 1957 and Ans ield et al. CanserChemotherapy Reports 32,101 1963 have revealed that it has a broad antitumor spectrum. Since then, S fluorouracil has become one of the antitumor agents in widest use in the treatment of various adenocarcinomas, inclusive of digestive organ cancer and breast cancer, and so fort.In Japan, the so called masked type 5 fluorouracil compounds, such as 1 2 tetrahydrofurfuryl 5 fluorouracil and 5 fluoro l hexylcarbariloyluracil, have been studied intensively in the attempt to reduce the toxic effects encountered when 5 fluorouracil is directly administered and, for some of them, therapeutic regimes for oral administration have already been established clinically. On the other hand, Japanese Published unexamined patent Laidiopen Nos. 55 7,231, 55 64,518, 56 46,813, 56 46,814 and 56 99,414 disclose that the antitumor effect of 5 fluorouracils can be potentiated by uracils. It is an object of the invention to provide a useful antitumor composition with which the antitumor activity of 5 fluorohexahydropyrimidines Japanese Published uneQcdned patent Laid open No. 59 13,780 having the general formula I EMI2.1 wherein 21 is a lower alkyl group and P2 is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, can be further potentiated. Under these circumstances, the present inventors conducted intensive investigations and, as a result, found that the antitumor activity of the compounds of general formula I can be significantly potentiated by concomitant administration of a pyrimidine nucleic acid base or the riboside thereof. This finding and further investigations have now resulted in completion of the present invention. Thus, the invention consists in an antitumor composition which contains a fluorohexahydropyrimidine of general formula I and a pyrinidine nucleic acid base and or the riboside thereof. The 5 fluo ohexanycro vrimidine to be used in accordance with the invention is a compound represented by the above general formula I , and a wide variety of compounds of this formula can be used. Referrring to general formula I , the lower alkyl represented by R1 and that represented by R2 may be the same or different and each is, for instance, an alkyl containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example,methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, secondary butyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, isopentyl or hexyl.With respect to the furfurylideneaminooxy group in position 4, and also with respect to the fluorine atom or aminoalkoxycarbonyl group in position 5 and the furfurylideneaminooxy group in positicn 4, there can occur cis and trans stereoisomers, and such respective isomers and mixtures thereof fall within the scope of general formula I , hence of the present invention. Among the compounds of general formula I , there are preferably used the following compounds, for instance o Ethyl 5 fluoro 4 Z furfurylideneaminooxy1 2,6 dioxohexahydropyrimidine 5 carboxylate compound 1 o Ethyl 5 fluoro 4 E furfurylideneaminooxy 2,6 dioxohexahydroyriiine 5 carboxylate compound 2 o Isobutyl 5 fluoro 4 Z furfurylideneaminooxy 2,6 dioxohexahydropyrimidine 5 carboxylate compound 3 o Isobutyl 5 fluoro 4 E furfurylideneaminooxy 2,6 dioxohexahydropyrimidine 5 carboxylate conpound 4 o Ethyl 5 fluoro 4 Z 5 methyl furfurylideneaminooxy 2,6 dioxohexahydropyrimidine 5 carboxylate compound 5 o Isopropyl 5 fluoro 4 E furfurylideneaminooxy 2,6 dioxohexahydropyrimidine 5 carboxylate compound 6 and o Isopropyl 5 fluoro 4 Z furfurylideneaminooxy 2,6 dioxohexahydropyrimidine 5 carboxylate compound 7 . The compounds of general formula I are all known compounds, and a method of producing the same is described, for example, in Japanese Published unexamined patent Laidopen No. 59 13,780. In the antitumor composition according to the invention, the 5 fluorohexahydropyrinidines of general formula I may be incorporated either alone or in combination of two or more. The term pyrimidine nucleic acid base as used herein means a pyrimidine base contained in nucleic acids and includes uracil, cytosine and thymine, and the riboside thereof includes uridine, cytidine, thymidine and 2 deoxy derivatives of these. Of those compounds, one or more are selected for use. The proportion of the 5 fluorohexahydropirimidine to the pyrimidine nucleic acid base and or riboside thereof in the antituor composition according to the invention may vary depending on the kind cf each compound contained therein, the dosage room, and other factors.Generally, however, the pyrimidine nucleic acid base ana or riboside thereof is used in an amount of nct less than 0.5 mole, preferably not less than 1 mole, ore preferably not less than 2 moles, ter mole of the compound of general formula I . Although the antitT.or effect increases with the increase in the proportIon of the pyrimidine nucleic acid base and or riboside thereof, said base and or riboside is generally used in a proportion of not more than about 20 moles, preferably not more than about 15 moles, per mole of the compound of general formula I . Even when the 5 fluorohexahydropyrimidine and the pyrimidine nucleic acid base and or riboside thereof are administered separately, the antitumor activity can be increased. It is preferable, however, to administer the both simultaneously in the form of a mixture prepared in advance. The unit dosage form of the antitumor composition according to the invention may be selected from among various forms depending on the therapeutic purpose. For example, there may be mentioned dosage forms for oral administration, such as powders, tablets, capsules, granu lar preparations and liquid preparations, and dosage forts for parenteral administration, such as suppositories and injections.In making up the composition into such unit dosage forms, any appropriate carrier knon in the art can be used and the forming can be carried out by an ap propriate means commonly employed in the art. The amount of the 5 fluorohexahydropyrimidine to be incorporated in such various unit dosage forms varies depending on the kind of said compound itself as well as on the kind of the p1jrimidine nucleic acid base and or riboside thereof to be used combinedly and therefore cannot be specified definitely. Generally however, said compound is used in an anount, per dosage unit, of about 5 500 ma for oral preparations, about 5 300 mg for injections, or about 10 800 ma for suppositories, the pyrimidine nucleic acid base and or riboside thereof being used, for example, in the proportion mentioned above based on said anount of 5 fluorohexahydropyrimidine.The daily dose, too, depends on the kind of said 5 fluorohexahydropyrimidine and the proportion of the parrinidine nucleic acid base and or riboside thereof, hence cannot be specifically given. generally, however, it is desirable, in the estimation from the results of fundamental pharmacological efficacy tests, that the daily clinical dose be in the range of about 0.4 12 mg kg body weight for oral preparations, about 0.2 6 mg ks body weight for injections, or about 0.8 16 ng kg body weicht for suppositories. A characteristic feature o the present invention lies in that the antitumor activity of the 5 fluorohexahydro pyrimidine of general formula I is remarkably increased by the joint use of a pyrimidine nucleic acid base and or the riboside thereof, which each itself has little antitumor activity. Thus, the antitumor composition according to the invention can be safely administered either orally or paren terally and produce a very great antitumor effect as compared with the case of single administration of the 5 fluoro hexahydropyrimidine o general formula I and therefore can inhibit the growth of tumor cells and produce a significant life span prolonging effect in cancer bearing warm blooded animals e.g. rat, mouse, human .Thus, for example, the composition according to the invention is useful as an antitumor agent for varieties of solid cancer e.g. digestive organ cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, urinary organ cancer .
