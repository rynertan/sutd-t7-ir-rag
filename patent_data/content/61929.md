## Description
INDUCTION SEALABLE CONTAINER CLOSURE Technical Field This invention is related to container closures.More particularly it relates to closures for containers of powdered materials, particularly to innerseal systems for such containers. Background Art The use of finely divided powders such as corn starch and talcum or baby powder as a personal care product is common. Such powders are typically packaged in containers having a wide opening covered by an apertured dispensing cap. Usually these caps comprise an inner disk like, apertured element that fits within the neck of the container opening, and an outer apertured element that fits over the inner element and the neck of the container opening. The inner and outer elements are concentrically positioned with respect to each other and are centrally, rotatably attached to each other so that the outer element can be rotated with respect to the inner element. While such closures are in widespread use, they do exhibit certain disadvantageous characteristics. For example, they can be removed, even by small children, thereby leaving the container opening completely uncovered. This permits the contents to be readily spilled from the container, creating potential health hazards due to ingestion and inhalation of the powder.This is a particularly serious problem when small children ingest or inhale the powder. Additionally, such closures do not prevent leakage of the powder from the container even when in the closed position. As a result, significant amounts of the powder can escape from the container and contaminate the surrounding area. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention provides a closure for containers of powdered material that is affixed to the container and that virtually eliminates the possibility that the powder can suddenly be ingested or inhaled in large quantities. Additionally, the preferred aspect of the invention dramatically reduces leakage of the powder from the container when the closure is in the closed position. In accordance with one aspect of the invention there is provided an article, useful as an innerseal to at least partially cover the open end of a container of powdered material comprising a disk shaped body having a plurality of apertures therethrough, said apertures being equally angularly separated from adjacent apertures and being circumferentially located between the geometric center and the outer edge of said body, and wherein said body comprises a stiff, compressible substrate having first and second surfaces, a layer of a metal foil, capable of inductively transferring heat to adjacent layers, on said first surface of said substrate, and a heat activated sealing material on the exposed surface of said metal foil. In another aspect of the invention there is provided a closure system comprising the above mentioned innerseal and a circular cap. In yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a container having the above mentioned closure system applied thereto. In still another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for sealing the open end of a container of powdered material. Brief Description of the Drawings The present invention will be further understood with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein like reference characters refer to the same elements throughout the several views and wherein FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of the invention partially broken away to show details thereof FIGURE 2 is an exploded view of a portion of the innerseal aspect of the invention, this view being greatly enlarged and FIGURES 3 6 are plan views of alternative embodiments of.the innerseal aspect of the invention. Detailed Description Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown a container 1, comprising a hollow body 2 having a circular open end 3 covered by a disk shaped innerseal 4 and an outer, circular cap 5. Open end 3 preferably has a neck portion 3a, and an exterior ridge 6 which cooperatively engages interior ridge 7 of cap 5. Additionally, open end 3 preferably has stops 8 located on exterior ridge 6 to engage interior stop 9 on cap 5. Ridge 7 and stop 9 are preferably separated from each other a distance sufficient to allow ridge 6 to ride therebetween. Stops 8 are located a sufficient distance apart so that cap 5 can be rotated between a totally closed position i.e., apertures 10 and 11 out of registry with each other and a totally open position i.e., apertures 10 and 11 in registry with each other . Ridge 18 is also provided on neck portion 3a to act as a base beyond which cap 5 cannot extend. Ridges 6 and 7 cooperatively engage or mate with each other and act in concert to hold cap 5 onto neck portion 3a by assisting in compressing innerseal 4 around rim 19 of neck 3a. The surfaces of ridges 6 and 7 that engage or mate with each other are preferably sloped. Container 1 can have any configuration desired.FIG. 1 shows one useful configuration, here a generally oblong, hollow body closed at one end and open at the other. Additionally, container 1 can be made from any rigid material including, for example, glass, metal, and polymeric materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, and so forth, provided that innerseal 4 can be induction sealed thereto. The foregoing container materials are only representative of those that may be used in the container. Cap 5 comprises the outer element of the closure system of the invention. It may be made from any rigid material and may be made of the same or a different material than that of container 1. Cap 5 comprises a circular base 20 and a wall 21 rising perpendicularly therefrom and totally encircling base 20. Base 20 and wall 21 define a cavity into which innerseal 4 is positioned. A plurality of apertures or openings 10 are provided through base 20 of cap 5. They are equally angularly separated from adjacent apertures and are circumferentially located between the geometric center and the outer edge of base 20. Additionally, they are each preferably located the same radial distance from the geometric center of the base 20. The exact distance from the center of base 20 to the center of apertures 10 is selected so that said apertures can be positioned in registry with apertures 11 of innerseal 4. Preferably apertures 10 are slightly smaller in diameter than apertures 11. Innerseal 4 comprises a disk shaped body having a plurality of apertures or holes 11 therethrough. A centrally positioned portion of a fastening material l2 is shown joining innerseal 4 to cap 5. Apertures 11 are equally angularly separated from adjacent apertures 11 by the same angle as are apertures 10 of cap 5.Additionally, they are each preferably located the same radial distance from the geometric center of innerseal 4 as apertures 10 are located from the center of cap 5. The center of apertures 11 are circumferentially located between the center and the outer edge of innerseal 4 so that they can be positioned in registry with apertures 10 of cap 5. Innerseal 4 has the same shape as opening 3 of container 1. It is dimensioned so that it rests on rim 19 of opening 3 and covers all of said opening except for those portions left open by apertures 11. It is preferred that innerseal 4 have a slightly larger diameter than opening 3. Innerseal 4 is sufficiently compressible i.e., it can be reduced in thickness by the application of pressure to compensate for any minor surface irregularities in rim 19 and provide intimate contact with said rim. Additionally, when cap 5 is placed over the innerseal 4, the innerseal molds itself around rim 19.Innerseal 4 is sufficiently thick so.that there is essentially no open space between it and cap 5. Within this limitation, it may be of any desired thickness. It has been found that thicknesses in the range of about 0.5 to 1.5 millimeters mm are useful. The innerseal 4 may be made from a variety of materials including polymers, paper and metal foils. At least one surface of the innerseal bears a heatactivatable material for contact with rim 19 of open end 3. Additionally, innerseal 4 is preferably rigid so as to resist bowing or sagging. An example of a useful innerseal construction is illustrated in Fig. 2. This construction comprises a heat activatable layer 13 adhered to side 14a of metal foil layer 14 by a first adhesive layer 15. Side 14b of metal foil layer 14 is adhered to side 16a of a substrate 16 by means of a second adhesive layer 17. A bonding material 12 may be located on the side 16b of substrate 16, although it is preferably applied to cap 5 before the innerseal 4 is inserted therein. This construction may be prepared by coating side 14a of metal foil layer 14 with adhesive layer 15.After adhesive layer 15 is dried, heat activatable layer 13 is applied thereof. Adhesive layer 17 may then be coated onto side 14b of layer 14 and then side 16a of substrate 16 applied thereto. It is not necessary to dry layer 17 before substrate 16 is applied thereto. The desired innerseal configuration and apertures may then be punched out of the bulk construction. Common coating techniques, such as rotogravure coating, may be employed to apply adhesive layers 15 and 17. The amount of adhesive.utilized is sufficient to provide strong bonds between the layers. For example coating weights between 0.3 and 1 milligram cm2 for layers 15 and 17 are satisfactory. A number of materials may be used for the individual components of the construction of Figure 2.For example, heat activatable layer 13 may comprise a heat activatable adhesive or a thermoplastic organic polymer. Preferably it is readily heat activatable. Examples of thermoplastic organic polymers useful as layer 13 include polyethylene, polypropylene, copolymers of ethylene, copolymers of propylene, polyvinyl chloride, ethylene vinylacetate, acrylic polymers, polyvinylidene chloride polymers, etc. Another class of materials useful as heatactivatable layer 13 include composite laminated films made up of two or more organic films. They may be prepared by a variety of techniques including coextrusion, lamination, and the like. A particularly useful film of this type is described in U.S. Patent 3,188,265. It is made up of a difficultly heat sealable organic polymer film layer, such as polyester, with a readily heatsealable organic polymeric film layer, such as polyethylene, thereon. The two layers are chemically interfacially united by a bond so strong that the layers cannot be mechanically separated. The heat activatable layer 13 is sufficiently thick to provide a strong bond between the innerseal 4 and rim 19. Its exact thickness is not, of itself, critical to the invention. It has been found that layers in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 millimeter thick provide satisfactory results. Metal foil layer 14 is preferably flexible. It receives and converts a radio frequency of a predetermined wavelength range e.g., 40 to 800 kilohertz into thermal energy. This thermal energy is inductively transferred to heat activatable layer 13 causing it to soften.Typically, metal foil layer 14 comprises tin, aluminum, or copper foil, or the like. Although the thickness of layer 14 is not critical to the invention, it is preferably from 0.01 to 0.1 millimeter thick. Substrate 16 is the compressible layer in the embodiment shown and provides rigidity to innerseal 4 and is preferably not thermoplastic. Pulp board is one example of a material useful as substrate 16. The thickness of substrate 16 is not critical to the invention. However, it has been found that thicknesses in the range of 0.5 to 1 millimeter are most useful. A variety of adhesives may be used as layers 15 and 17. The nature of the adhesive employed is not critical to the invention provided that it securely anchor the respective layers to each other and provided further that it can withstand the temperatures generated during induction sealing and does not interfere with induction sealing. Examples of adhesives useful as layers 15 and 17 include Adcote 503A, a two component adhesive having a viscosity of about 700 1,200 cps at 250C, a density of 0.95 grams cubic centimeter available from Morton ChemicalCompany Unoflex E, a one component urethane prepolymer having a viscosity of 4,000 8,000 cps at 250C available from Polymer Industries and No. 49001 polyester resin having a slight tack at 250C, a specific gravity of 1.22, being soft and plastic at 250C, available fromE. I. duPont de Nemours and Company Incorporated. Bonding material 12 holds innerseal 4 in position in cap 5 during placement of said cap on container 1.Bonding material 12 has a torque resistance in the range of 10 to 60, preferably 15 to 30, Newton meter. At a torque resistance of above 60 Newton meter, the cap 5 is too difficult to break away from the innerseal 4 to be of practical use. At a torque resistance of below 10 Newtonmeter, the bond can be broken by jarring actions encountered during shipping and also when the closure is applied to the container. The torque resistance is measured according toASTM D 3198 73. An Owens Illinois torque tester available from Owens Illinois, Inc., Glass Container Division is useful for measuring the torque resistance. Although bonding material 12 may be applied directly to innerseal 4, it is preferably applied to cap 5 followed by insertion of innerseal 4 into cap 5 so that the innerseal 4 fits concentrically therein. The top surface 16b of the innerseal 4 contacts the bonding material 12. Innerseal 4 is preferably inserted into cap 5 so that apertures 10 of the cap 5 and apertures 11 of the innerseal 4 are not in registry. Bonding material 12 may be applied to cap 5 by brushing, dripping from a nozzle, spraying, and the like.It is preferably applied as a thin and has a thin dried thickness i.e., 0.005 to 0.01 millimeter thick layer. The bonding material 12 may either be applied to the entirety of the surface of the cap 5 or selectively to the surface of the cap. The assembled cap 5 and innerseal 4 are then placed over open end 3 of a container 1 of powdered material, adjusted to a position such that stops 8 contact stops 9, and induction sealed by techniques known to the art. While the exact configuration of the bonding material i2 is not critical to the invention, it has been found that certain configurations dramatically reduce powder leakage from the container. For example, selective application of the bonding material 12 to provide the patterns shown in FIGS. 3 6, here on innerseal 4 rather than on cap 5, provide unexpected results. As can be seen, these patterns each represent a selective application of the bonding material 12 to the area between adjacent apertures. Surprisingly, these configurations reduce leakage more effectively than does an overall application of bonding material 12. It is also noted that where an overall application of bonding material 12 is utilized, it is preferred that a narrow band or margin around the outer edge of the cap 5 and the innerseal 4 be left free of the bonding material. Preferably these materials are adhesive in nature and comprise one or more organic materials. They may be pressure sensitive materials, hot melt materials, solvent soluble materials, and the like. A wide variety of materials are useful as bonding material 12. A particularly useful bonding material comprises a water dispersed synthetic elastomer based adhesive having a viscosity of about 54,500 cps at 250C, available as Scotch Grip Brande Industrial Adhesive 871 from 3MCompany. Other bonding materials having the requisite torque resistance are also known and are included within the scope of this invention.
