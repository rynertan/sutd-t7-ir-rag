# A method of producing X ray diffracting gratings.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of producing X ray masks by forming a relief pattern of predetermined section in silicon or silicon dioxide and then moulding a plastics material with an inverse relief pattern. Thereafter, an X ray absorbing material such as tungsten is deposited at an oblique angle onto the relief structure in the plastics material.
