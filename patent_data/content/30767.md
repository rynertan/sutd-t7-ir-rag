# Thermoplastic resin composition for fabric fibers with improved strength and elasticity and process of its manufacture.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic rubber composition is provided having improved strength and elasticity whilst being capable of extrusion into fibers or films. The composition cornprises 50 80 of an A B A block copolymer in which B is poly ethylene butylene and A is a thermoplastic polymer that is phase incompatible with B, together with 20 50 of a fully acid or fatty alcohol containing from 12 24 carbon atoms. A process for making the extruded fibers of films is also described.
