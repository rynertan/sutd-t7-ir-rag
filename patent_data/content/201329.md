## Description
This invention relates to field effect transistors FET s . Integrated circuits are constructed with a large number of semi conductor devices including field effect transistors for performing various functions such as logic, memory, and signal conditioning functions. In the construction of electronic circuits which perform the foregoing functions, it is often advantageous to employ both depletion mode FET s and enhancement mode FET s. In an n channel depletion mode FET, current flows in the presence of zero volts impressed between the gate and the source terminals, the current being terminated upon application of a negative voltage to the gate terminal relative to the source terminal. In n channel enhancement mode FET s, there is no current flow in the presence of zero volts between the source and the gate terminals, the current being initiated by the application of a positive voltage to the gate terminal relative to the source terminal. The foregoing two gate voltage relationships permit the combination of enhancement mode and depletion mode FET s in a complementary circuit configuration. A problem arises in the construction of large arrays of FET s when it may be desired to construct both a depletion mode FET and an enhancement mode FET on a single substrate as part of an integrated circuit IC . Both forms of FET s can be built with the same physical structure, the differing characteristics of the two types of FET s being attained by differences in the doping of semiconductor materials employed in the construction. While FET s may be constructed of silicon, the transistors of particular interest herein are constructed of a semiconductor compound of elements taken from group III and group V of the periodic table because the III V compounds provide FET s with substantially higher frequency characteristics than are provided by silicon transistors. The problem is manifested by the different doping requirements of individual ones of the FET s in the array of FET s to provide for the desired depletion and enhancement characteristics. The desired characteristics can also be obtained by altering the physical structure of the gate region or the thickness of a top layer of semiconductor material. In both cases, the attainment of the desired characteristics is accomplished by fabrication processes operating from the top surface inward to provide the requisite structure and or doping. However, as a practical matter in the construction of large arrays of FET s, it is much simpler to construct all of the transistors with the same physical structures and with the same doping, such being the case whether the transistors are of the metal oxide semiconductor type formed with an insulated gate, or a metal semiconductor construction with a Schottky barrier or an FET including modulation doping MODFET , or a semiconductor insulator semiconductor FET. A field effect transistor comprising source and drain regions defining a channel region characterised, according to the invention by a buried doped region disposed under and spaced from the channel region, the buried doped region serving to determine the threshold voltage of the transistor. The separation of the buried region or pocket and the channel is particularly important in devices such as the MODFET, where preservation of a large carrier mobility in the channel is highly desirable. Furthermore, the method of altering the threshold voltage is well suited to insulated gate structures, such as the gallium arsenide gate FET. A preferred embodiment of the transistor of the invention contains all of the physical features of a conventional field effect transistor, and further comprises the foregoing pocket layer disposed beneath and spaced from the source and drain regions of the transistor. A preferred embodiment employs an n channel MODFET in which a first, or top, layer is composed of group III V compounds such as a layer of gallium aluminium arsenide. A second layer, this layer underlying the first layer, is composed of a compound from the same group of elements such as gallium arsenide. The pocket layer is formed within the second layer by doping the gallium arsenide, and on a substrate of p type conductivity of the same semiconductor as the second layer. The doping of the pocket layer depends on the role which is played by the layer. For example, in the case wherein the pocket layer is to change an enhancement mode FET to become a depletion mode FET, the pocket layer is doped with a donor dopant such as silicon. Such doping provides electrons, which under the conditions of voltages applied to terminals of the device including a terminal on the back side of the device, migrate towards the charge conduction channel of the FET while depleting the pocket layer. By filling the conductor channel with electrons, the pocket layer alters the characteristic of the FET from the enhancement mode in which the conduction channel is substantially void of electrons to the depletion mode wherein the conduction band is substantially full of electrons . With the foregoing arrangement, all of the transistors in an array of transistors on an IC can be constructed identically as enhancement mode FET s with specific ones of the transistors being singled out to be converted to depletion mode FET s by installation of the pocket layer. In the construction of the composite transistor structure of the invention in which both the pocket layer and the FET are constructed together, the pocket layer is built before the construction of the top layer and the terminals. Typically, the construction would begin by providing a substrate which would serve as a bottom support for the transistor, and the foregoing second layer would be grown upon the substrate. Use of a p type material in the substrate provides a well defined electric field which improves carrier confinement in the conduction channel. The process would be altered for construction of the pocket as by epitaxial deposition of the pocket layer, after which construction of the second layer would be resumed by further epitaxial growth upon the underlying material of the second layer. Alternatively, the second layer can be completed in its entirety after which the doping of the pocket region can be accomplished by ion implantation. Thereafter, the first, or top, layer is grown epitaxially upon the second layer, and the source and drain regions are provided as by ion implantation or diffusion of a suitable dopant such as silicon for n type substrates or beryllium for p type substrates. The gate metal is then deposited upon the first layer to form the gate electrode and thereby complete the gate terminal. The source and drain terminals are formed, typically, of metal alloy and thus serve as ohmic contacts to the source and drain regions of the transistor. How the invention can be carried out will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which With reference to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown an array 10 of field effect transistors 12 disposed on a common substate 14. Each transistor 12 is constructed with the same physical features and the same doping, and may be either of the enhancement mode or of the depletion mode. By way of example, Figure 1 shows the transistors 12 constructed with the characteristic of the enhancement mode with certain ones of the transistors 12, such as the transistor on the right side of the figure, having its characteristics altered to a depletion mode by implacement of a pocket layer 16 beneath it. Each of the transistors 12 comprises an upper layer 18 and a lower layer 20, both of which comprise semiconductor compounds of elements of groups III and V of the periodic table. The upper layer 18 is grown epitaxially upon the lower layer 20. The pocket layer 16 is located within the lower layer 20. Each of the transistors 12 further comprises a source terminal 22, a drain terminal 24 and a gate electrode 26 which are shown disposed upon the upper layer 18. A source region 22 and a drain region 24 underly the source terminal 22 and the drain terminal 24, respectively. While various semiconductor materials may be employed in the construction of the array 10, the exemplary embodiment of Figure 1 employs n A1GaAs in the upper layer 18, intrinsic GaAs in the lower layer 20 and p GaAs in the substrate 14. With respect to the construction of the pocket layer 16, the layer 16 is doped with a suitable dopant which is either a donor or an acceptor depending on the desired conversion of the transistor characteristic. Thus, by way of example, in the event that all of the transistors 12 were constructed and doped for depletion mode operation, and it is desired to convert some of the transistors to operate in the enhancement mode, then the pocket layer 16 is doped with an acceptor dopant which receives electrons from the charge conduction band so as to convert the conduction band to that of an enhancement mode transistor. Alternatively, and as has been described above with respect to Figure 1, the transistors 12 may be constructed of identical physical structure and doping for enhancement mode operation, in which case the pocket layer 16 is doped with a donor dopant which provides electrons for the conduction channel to provide the characteristics of a depletion mode channel. In the embodiment of Figure 1 silicon is employed as the dopant for the pocket layer 16. The pocket layer 16 is spaced from the source region, drain region and gate terminal of its transistor 12. The pocket layer 16 is located beneath a charge conduction channel to be described with reference to Figure 3 at a depth which is greater than approximately three wavelengths of the electron wave function, but less than the spacing between the source and the drain regions, to alter a threshold voltage while preserving a high carrier mobility in a transistor located above the pocket layer. The lateral extent of the pocket layer 16 in directions parallel to the interface between the lower layer 20 and substrate 14 is commensurate with the spacing between the transistor and the pocket layer. The pocket layer should extend laterally at least an amount equal to the extent of the gate region of the transistor and, preferably, extends still further under the source and the drain regions so as to adequately define the electric potential surface which alter the characteristics of the transistor. If the pocket layer is brought in more closely to its transistor, the lateral extent of the layer may be reduced, and if the pocket layer is located at a greater distance from its transistor, then the lateral extent of the layer should be enlarged so as to provide protection from fringing fields of other transistors 12 of the array 10. A typical spacing of the pocket from the transistor is approximately equal to the distance between the source and the drain terminals. The operation of the pocket layer 16 in converting a transistor 12 from the enhancement mode to the depletion mode is explained in Figure 2. Both of the graphs show electron energy levels for a MODFET as a function of depth into the semiconductor layers, the left hand side of each graph being the top surface of the upper layer 18 at the gate electrode, while the right hand side of each graph represents a back surface of the substrate 14. A terminal 28 is located on the back surface of the substrate 14 and, in operation of the device of Figure 1, is connected to a negative voltage relative to a source terminal in each of the transistors 12, the source terminal being grounded, typically. The doping of the substrate 14 enables the substrate 14 to serve as a plane of uniform potential so that the energy band diagrams of Figure 2 apply to each of the transistors 12 of the array 10. The structure of Figure 1 may be regarded as a portion of an integrated circuit chip 30. The right hand side of each of the graphs of Figure 2 are of constant energy levels corresponding to the electrically conducting characteristics of the substrate 14 on the back side of the chip 30. For convenience in portraying the energy diagrams, the right hand side of each of the graphs has been broken away to conserve space in the figure. Both graphs show a discontinuity in the conduction band and in the valence band at the site of a charge conduction channel shown in Figure 3. The graph on the left represents the energy band format of the enhancement mode FET s on the left side of Figure 1, while the graph on the right side of Figure 2 represents the band levels of the depletion mode FET on the right side of Figure 1. Both graphs show the lowest energy levels at a point beneath the gate terminal in each of the transistors. In the right hand graph, both the conduction band E The feature wherein the characteristics of transistors are interchanged, namely that an enhancement mode is converted to a depletion mode or vice versa, is accomplished by the reduction of the potential of the conduction band. The reduction is a sufficient amount to allow the band to fill with electrons, this occurring in the chip 30 at the site of the conduction channel of the FET being modified by the pocket layer 16. As a result, the depleted channel of an enhancement mode FET becomes a full channel in a depletion mode. The effect of the negative voltage applied to the back terminal 28 is identified in the left hand graph by V With reference to Figure 3, there is provided a further explanation of the construction of the right hand transistor 12 of Figure 1. Figure 3 shows only the portion of the chip 30 relating to the transistor 12 on the right side of Figure 1. Figure 3 shows the source and drain terminals 22 and 24 and regions 22 and 24 of Figure 1, as well as the gate electrode 26 and the back terminal 28. The gate electrode 26, in combination with the upper layer 18 contiguous thereto, form a gate terminal 32. The upper layer 18 has a thickness of approximately 50 nm. The thickness of the pocket layer 16 is less than approximately 100 nm and is spaced approximately 300 nm from the upper layer 18. The lower layer 20 has a thickness of approximately 3 micrometers, and the substrate 14 has a thickness of approximately 500 micrometers. It is noted that the substrate 14 plays no specific role in the operation of the transistors other than providing a continuous electric potential surface along the backside of the chip. A charge conduction channel 34 is disposed in the layer 20 alongside the interface between the layers 18 and 20, and conducts electrons between the source region 22 and the drain region 24 . Typically, the drain region 24 is operated at a voltage which is positive relative to the source region 22 so as to attract the electrons from the source region 22 . The gate voltage V In the construction of Figure 3, the gallium arsenide of the lower layer 20 serves as an intrinsic buffer layer. A silicon dopant in the pocket layer acts as a donor and is applied from a suitable source of ion implantation or diffusion with a dose of approximately 5 x 10¹¹ atoms per square centimetre. While the teachings of the figures apply to different forms of FET s, a MODFET has been disclosed as the preferred embodiment, and the band diagrams of Figure 2 are drawn for the MODFET energy levels. Metal of the gate electrode 26 in contact with the semiconductor material of the upper layer 18 forms a Schottky barrier at the gate terminal 32. The technique can also be applied to p channel FET s, which FET s can be operated in either the depletion mode or the enhancement mode. With either the p type or n type FET s, the basic concept in the operation of the pocket layer is the same, namely, that the dopants in the pocket layer become depleted of either electrons or holes as may be required to impart the desired characteristics to the conduction channel 34. Accordingly, in the construction of a p channel FET, the physical arrangement of the components would be the same as that shown in the drawing figures for the n channel device. However, the roles of the dopants in the pockets of the two devices would be reversed. Thus, in the p channel FET, an acceptor dopant in the pocket converts the operating mode from enhancement mode to depletion mode, and a donor dopant in the pocket converts the operating mode from depletion mode to enhancement mode. The upper layer 18 is constructed of the same material in both the p channel and the n channel FET s and the lower level 20 is constructed of the same material in both the p channel and the n channel FET s. In a preferred embodiment of the p channel FET, silicon is advantageously utilised as the donor dopant, and berillium is advantageously utilised as the acceptor dopant. The upper layer 18 comprises p A1GaAs and the lower layer 20 comprises intrinsic GaAs. By way of alternative embodiments of the n channel FET, it is noted that the substrate may be composed of a semi insulating substrate of gallium arsenide in which case the lower layer 20 would be p GaAs. No terminal would be placed on the back side of the substrate due to the insulating properties of the substrate. The p GaAs layer of the lower level 20 would provide an electrostatic coupling between the source terminal 22 and the pocket layer 16 and between the drain terminal 24 and the pocket layer 16. Thus, the dopant in the pocket layer 16 would have a strong effect on the energy level in the region of conduction channel 34, the effect being strong enough to be effective without the terminal on the back side of the substrate 14. However, the p GaAs is preferred for the substrate 14 in view of the fact that the electrically conducting properties thereof establish well defined electric filed lines between the front and back surfaces of the chip 30. This greatly facilitates the selection of the spacing and size of the pocket layer 16 to provide the desired electrical characteristics for the transistor 12 of the array 10. The dimensions of size and placement shown in Figure 3 provide good operation of the device. If desired, further adjustment of the dimensions of sizes and spacing may be applied to provide a desired set of current voltage characteristics for the transistor 12.
