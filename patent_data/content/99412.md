# COMPRESSOR.

## Abstract
A compressor for suppressing the refrigerating capacity during high speed by utilizing the suction loss caused when the pressure in a vane chamber in a suction stroke drops below that of the pressure of the refrigerant supply source, comprising a rotor 14 slidably provided with vanes 12 , a cylinder 11 holding the rotor 14 and the vanes 12 , side plates attached to both side surfaces of said cylinder 11 sealing the space of vane chambers 18a , 18b formed by the vanes 12 , the rotor 14 and the sides of the cylinder 11 , and at least two suction holes 15 , 17 formed in the cylinder 11 or in the side plates. Even when a compressor has a number of vanes 12 , there is no loss of refrigerating capacity at low speed, and a compressor with a capacity controller which can suppress the refrigerating capacity effectively only at high speed can be provided.
