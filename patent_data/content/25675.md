# Arrangements for data timing recovery from distorted signals for use in adaptive modems with multi level coding.

## Abstract
The submission makes use of the fact that where an adaptive equaliser APS is incorporated in a modem, some sort of training sequence is employed prior to the transmission of the data message. This training sequence usually incorpo rates a block of pseudo random data DIS transmitted at the basic symbol rate to provide the equaliser APS with a relative ly less distorted signal to operate on. During the training period both threshold derived timing TCTRL and Nyquist derived timing NTRL are produced. The Nyquist derived timing NTRL is then phase shifted APS to correspond to the threshold derived timing TCTRL which is valid during the training period. The phase shift APS is then fixed so that, when multi level coding is introduced valid timing can still be obtained from the Nyquist derived timing signal NTRL . In ad dition in the event of transmission interruptions the invention allows timing recovery without the need for a new training cy cle.

## Description
TITLE ARRAGEMENTS FOR DATA TIMING RECOVERY FROM DISTORTED SIGNALS FOR USE IN ADOPTIVE MODEMS WITH MULTI LEVEL CODING The present invention relates to an arrangement for recovering the data symbol timing from the received signal in a data transmission system. Various methods are in common use for example pilot tones can be used or the envelope modulation caused by multiple spectral components in the signal but in narrowbandwidth systems, timing is derived from the demodulated data signal by inspecting the zero crossing or thresholdcrossing instants, or by producing a timing signal by squaring a narrow band of data components in the region of the so called Nyquist frequency which is equal to half the data symbol frequency . For the satisfactory operation of either of these latter methods the data message has to be scrambled or encoded to produce an adequate number of threshold crossings and an approximately even spectral distribution of energy when adverse patterns, such as continuous mark or space, are required to be transmitted. When the use of multi level coding with adaptive equalization is considered, satisfactory demodulation and decoding of data is possible from signals so badly distorted that threshold crossings appear to occur uniformly throughout the symbol period. However, in these conditions, timing derived from threshold crossings is meaningless.At the same time, delay distortion across the signal spectrum means that timing derived from the Nyquist frequency components, while correct in frequency, may be far removed in phase from the optimum position. The problem is, therefore, to derive timing which is near the optimum position from a severely distorted signal to allow the adaptive equalizer to performs its function efficiently. The invention makes use of the fact that where an adaptive equalizer is incorporated in a modem, some sort of training sequence is employed prior to the transmission of the data message.This training sequence usually incorporates a block of pseudo random data transmitted at the basic symbol rate i.e. binary instead of the usual multi level encode to provide the equalizer with a relatively less distorted signal to operate on. aphis signal is also far more suitable for obtaining thresholdderived timing satisfactorily than is the corresponding multi level signal. The essence of the invention is that, during this training period, both threshold derived timing and Nyquistderived timing are produced. The Nyquist derived timing is then phase shifted to correspond to the thresholdderived timing, which is valid during this period. This phase shift is then fixed for as long as required so that, when multi level coding is subsequently introduced which may render the threshold derived timing meaningless valid timing is still obtained from the lRyquist derived timing signal which is independent of the form of coding so long as the signal is effectively scrambled .Further advantage of this invention is that valid timing can be recovered directly from the received demodulated signal when it has been restored following a break in trmnmis sion, without the need for a training sequence from the transmitter. The invention provides for the use of an independent threshold crossing timing recovery system to adjust, during a training period, the phase of a Ryquist timing recovery system to the optimum position for the operation of a decision feedback equalizer so that, when multi level transmission is in progress and threshold crossing timing recovery is impossible, the correct timing at the optimum phase can be maintained from the Nyquist derived timing. By way of an example, a possible implementation of the invention is shown in the drawing. The demodulated data signal DIS is applied to the threshold detector, the output of which is filtered in F3 a narrow bandpass filter tuned to the symbol timing frequency f5. The filtered signal is fed to the phase lock loop A PULA which substantially reduces the jitter.The output of this phase lock loop is used as a phase reference during the training period i.e. while contactsTP are closed . The demodulated data signal is also filtered in F1, which is a bandpass filter designed to provide, in conjunction with the modem filtering, a narrow pass band symetrical about the Nyquist frequency of f5. The output of this filter is squared in the multiplier Z and filtered by F2, which can be substantially identical to 23. This signal is fed to a second phase lock loop B PLLB to reduce jitter, and then phase shifted in the adjustable phase shifter APS.The phase shift is adjusted during the training period until the output symbol timing is in phase with the threshold derived timing. This phase shift is then fixed under the control of the Nyquist timing recovery system NERL. The phase of APS remains set until a new training sequence occurs when the contacts TP are again closed to allow the threshold crossing timing recovery loop TCTRt to control the setting of the adjustable phase shifter APS. The threshold crossing timing recovery loop CTRD includes a threshold crossing detector TCD which is arranged to produce an output signal each time the input signal passes through zero as long as the signal level has exceeded a preset threshold level in the previous half cycle. In the case of the training period the information transmitted conform to a regular pattern allowing the timing to be validly recovered by this loop iC2RI .
