# A decorative unit, particularly but not exclusively a building unit and the use of a plurality of them for forming a variety of decorated surfaces.

## Abstract
A modular unit as described for use in a multiunit decorative or structural arrangement. Each modular unit has, on at least one surface, an asymmetrical design 2 which may be two dimensional or three dimensional. These asymmetrical designs are arranged so that portions 3,4 of the design terminate at edges of the surface in such a manner to permit a number of identical units to be arranged together to form a large variety of overall designs whose final form depends upon the relative positions of the individual units within the arrangement. For example, a number of identical square tile units are provided, each having the same design and with the design created so that a tile wall can be formed from the identical tiles with hundreds of different overall designs. The same large number of overall designs may be formed from units other than square units including three dimensional building blocks and similar basic decorative or construction units.

## Description
A decorative unit, particularly but not exclusively a building unitThe present invention relates to a method and means for decoration or construction using a number of identical modular units having a two or three dimensional design on one surface. More particularly, the invention relates to a method of forming identical designs on individual units so that a large number of overall designs may be obtained depending upon the particular orientation of the individual units within the overall surface or structure.The products presently used by architects, in both exterior and interior decoration, are characterized by a diversity ofstylistic peculiarities, textural differences, and varied materials.These products are further normally characterized by one common property which is their use in only obtaining a completely uniform and constantly repeating surface pattern. The structure and character of the pattern of these products when assembled creates only one uniform composition with a particular repeating pattern.In the past, covering the floor of a room, for example, required a number of differently decorated elements from which the overall pattern of the floor of the particular room was put together. Contemporary mass production with its demand for standardization and unification is not able, without an excessive increase of the cost of production, to produce articles having many differing patterns or drawings. When differing designs are required, it is done on an individual basis with a significant increase in expense for the design and manufacture.Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide an improved decoration or construction unit permitting individualized designs based upon the use of identical construction units.Another object of the invention is to provide an improved decorative or construction element capable of producing a large number of differing assemblies from identical individual units.Another object of the invention is to provide low cost customized decorated surfaces or structures at low cost.Another object of the invention is to provide an lmpro sea method of forming a large variety of differing design from identical individual units.Accordingly the present invention provides a modular unit for use with a plurality of similar such units in a decorative assembly, said modular unit having an asymmetric design on at least one surface with portions of this design extending to at least one of the edges of that surface for being combined with design portions on additional similar units, the portions of the asymmetrical design on the said one surface terminating at each of those edges being symmetrical with respect to the centre of the edge. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of forming a variety of decorated surfaces utilizing a plurality of similar modular units which are assembled to form the overall design comprising applying an asymmetric design to one surface of each unit, terminating a portion of said design at an edge of that surface, said design portions being at the centre of each such edge, or equally spaced on opposite sides of the centre of each such edge.The units, which may be decorative tiles or plaques or building blocks or carpet tiles or the like, are thus such that by providing a number of them having identical asymmetrical designs on one surface a variety of designs may be assembled. The designs are laid out to permit the units to be assembled with a variety of positions in respect of one another in forming differing overall designs. When a decorated square unit is used, for example, the individual design chosen permits several hundred different overall decorative wall or other designs to be formed using only the one basic unit design.This permits a standardization and a significant cost saving in the manufacture and supply of decoration and construction units. With only a single and easily produced design being used, hundreds of different, visually distinct, attractive campositve arrangements may be obtained. One of the many examples of this invention would be its use on common square decorative tiles. Using a single tile design for forming a household tile surface, several hundred different wall designs would be available for apartment construction using only a single decorative unit tile. The principle, as will be more fully explained below, is applicable to many other construction or decorative uses where similar inexpensive and mass produced units may be employed in producing large numbers of com pleted assemblies of differing and customized appearances.Other and further objects of the invention will be obvious upon an understanding of the illustrative embodiments about to be described or will be indicated in the appended claims, and various advantages not referred to herein will occur to one skilled in the art upon employment of the invention in practice.In order to promote a fuller understanding of the above, and other aspects of the present invention, some embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a design in accordance with the invention. Figure 2 is a plan view corresponding to Figure 1 illustrating a step in the design of a decoration unit. Figure 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of the unit of Figure 2 illustrating several positions in which the individual unit may be placed for combination with similar units in creating diff ering overall assemblies. Figure 4 is a diagrammatic view showing an assembly of square units illustrating a variety of unit placements. Figure 5 is a diagrammatic illustration of a hexagonal unit assembly illustrating possible variations. Figure 6 is a diagrammatic view illustrating rectangular units assembled in a variety of arrangements. Figures 7 through 12 are plan views of unit arrangements each illustrating a differing design andall assembled from a number of tiles of the tile design of Figure 2. Figures 13 through 15 illustrate three related unit designs for use in the method of the inven tion including treatment of border or marginal areas. Figure 16 is a plan view of a unit arrangement utilizing the units of Figures 13 through 15 and showing a method for border or margin arrange ment, and Figures 17 through 22 illustrate additional arrangements for non square units.The configuration of the individual unit of the embodiments i.e. its contour or design is such that a number of iden tical assembled units create a single decorated surface or a single three dimensional figure.Both planar formations and three dimensional formations may be used employing graphics, painting, sculpture, sculptural relief, mosaic, chiselling, casting, etc., and using various materials, both natural and synthetic including ceramic, glass, concrete, wood, plastics, fabrics and others.The following is a description of a unit having the capacity for permitting the formation of a large number of differing decorative and artistic figurative compositions from identical mass produced units. As a sample unit decoration, for descriptive purposes, a leaved flower 2 is used in a decorative shape whiCh suggests wings Figure 1 . In the square unit 1 illustrated and with the possibility of moving the design fragment in the plane of the unit, a position is selected for the leaved flower 2 at which its main part is moved into the right lower corner of the unit 1. The flower leaf 3 crosses the unit 1 side in the middle of side DC and the leaf 4 in the middle of the side BC, Figure 2 . Beyond the area of the main unit, there remains a part 3 of the lower leaf 3 in the unit 5 while the cut off part 4 of the upper leaf 4 remains in the unit 6, Figure 2 . In order to maintain all three partitioned elements of the design in the limits of the main unit 1, additional changes are made. The unit 5 is moved upwards to the position where the unit 5 overlies the unit 1.Now the cut off part of the leaf fragment 3 will be in side the main unit 1. A similar movement of the upper unit 6 so that it overlies the unit 1 moves the cut off part 4 of the leaf 3 into the unit 1.Thus within tie border of the closed unit 1, we have all three elements of the leaved flower design. In this arrangement, the width of both leaves 3 and 4 at the position where they cross over the edges of the main unit l are equal, i.e. FF GG , and the points K and L are the middle points of the sides BC and DC, i.e., HH EE , FF ,GGI, and the distance between the corners of the unit 1 an the leaf crossovers are equal, i.e., AS E B BF F C CG GDt DH HA. Thus, the significant features of the unit 1 are in the symmetry of the partitioned elements of the decorative flower relative to the square axes MK and IL and the centre of the square unit and in the equal width of the leaves at their crossing points at the unit edge and in the symmetry of the points E and 3 relative to the point I points F and F relative to point K points G and G relative to point L and points H and H relative to point M.These features of the design of the partitioned fragments are the key to the new wide image possibilities inherent in the unit, i.e., the possibility to produce from ident ical units a large number of various image combinations both byztiytbm and composition. The ability to form a large number of compositions from assemblies of the same unit follows from the fact that on the image plane, which consists of identical units, each unit can change its position while turning around its geometrical centre for 900, 1800, 2700, and 3600 Figures 3 and 4 . With each turn a new and different image composition is formed. With every new turn the partitioned elements of the unit form a new combination with other partitioned elements of the adjacent unit.Should the units be shaped in the form of equilateral hexagons, each new shape is formed by turning the unit around its geometrical centre of 600, i.e., 1200, 1800, 2400, 3000 and 3600 Figure 5 .Should the unit be formed in the shape of a rectangle with side proportions of 1 2, each new composition is achieved by turning the unit for 1800 or by turning a few units simultaneously Figure 6 .The same ability to form new image compositions is also available in three dimensional units having their structural designs similar to those of the plane units as described above.In this case, with each new position change of the volummetric units in the image plane, the volumetric partitioned elements form a new combination with the volumetric partitioned elements of the adjacent units. The joining of the adjacent units occurs at the crosssection of the relief in planes which are perpendicular to the unit plane.It will be seen that these improved decorative or construction units offer practically unlimited possibilities for the manufacturing of new materials and products for the decorative and applied arts.The units may be made fram natural or synthetic materials manufactured by a variety of methods and material treatments and in a variety of colours and compositions with various surface treatments.A great number of different artistic or decorative compositions can be created from the inexpensive identical units giving the possibility of creating almost unlimited numbers of different compositions. For example, from 20 identical units it is possible to create one billion different compositions.In order to determine the total number of possible image compositions, we have to consider all the possible position changes for the units that form an image field, including the possible position change of each individual unit for 900, 1800, 2700, 3600 see Figure 3 . This consideration also includes the possible position change of a few units simultaneously in any of its combinations with 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. units forming the image field. Also other possible unit position changes where each unit can change its position asynchronous with other units i.e., one unit on a 900, a second unit on 1800, a third on 270 , a fourth on 360 , a fifth on 180 90 , 270 ....etc. i.e., using all possible unit combinations and movements.An example follows where all possible combinations of 2 units A and B can be observed.EMI11.1 tb Uni SEP 90 SEP 90 SEP Each SEP Unit SEP Turn SEP in SEP degrees tb SEP B SEP 90 SEP 180 SEP 270 SEP 360 SEP 90 SEP 360 SEP 90 SEP 180 SEP 270 SEP 360 tb The total number of image combinations equals 16. Thus, if movements of one unit can form 4 combinations, then movements of 2 units can form 16 combinations, i.e., 42, 16 . Using this method we can determine a number of possible overall design compositions for any number of units which form an image or design field according to the formulaS 4n, where n is the number of units that form an image field, and 4 corresponds to a number of possible changes for a unit of a square configuration.For example, if we add a unit C in all its possible positions 900, 1800, 2700, 3600 to the units A and B as shown above, then there will be 16 new combinations at C 90 16 new combinations at C 180 16 new combinations at C2700, and 16 new combinations at C 3600 i.e., all the imagt compositions that correspond to the formula S 43 64 . For the units that have the shape of an equaliteral hexagon, this formula will be expressed S 6 This means that the number of image or design compositions for the field that consists of 4 units will number S 4 5 i.e., 256 for a square for 5 units S 4 , i.e. 1024, 8 46 for 6 units S 4 , i.e., 4096 etc. so that 10 units will provide 1,048,576 possible overall designs.Figures 7 through 12 illustrates a number of differing designs formed from an arrangement of identical units or tiles. The unit chosen for these illustrations is the unit of Figures 2 and 3. Figure 7, for example, shows a particular design with the identical tiles fitted together so that an overall pattern comprising a diagonal garland effect is obtained with the garlands being diagonal rows of a floral like design.Figure 8, which is formed of identical units or tiles differently arranged, shows diagonal garlands which alternate between a plain ribbon like garland and a flowerlike garland.Figure 9 also uses the same tiles re arranged to provide a diagonal floral or garland pattern with all of the diagonal members being identical.Figure 10 shows a further differing design formed again from the same units or tiles with a regular pattern comprising a series of closed generally rectangular floral patterns. Figure 11 shows another one of the many design possibilities comprising discreet floral like designs arranged in diagonal lines.Figure 12 illustrates a design using the same units or tiles which describe and comprise a winding garland pattern.As described above in the discussion of the total number of designs available, numerous additional designs or patterns may be made. In certain of the designs in which larger patterns are employed and where each larger pattern is formed from a number of units or tiles, it may be desirable to have a slightly differing marginal or border treatment. For this purpose, slightly modified tiles may be used.Figure 13 illustrates a decorated unit in accordance with the invention of the general pattern already described, for example, in forming designs such as those illustrated in Figures 7 through 12. The unit of Figure 14 includes only the design from the lower left corner of the Figure 13 unit while the unit of Figure 15 utilizes only design from the upper left hand corner. Figure 16 shows these additional units providing marginal or completing portions for designs whose central portion will normally include a number of tiles of the form shown in Figure 13.As described above, units in the form of rectangles may also be used to carry out the decorating method of the invention. Figure 17 illustrates a unit N in the form of a rectangle with its sides having a 1 to 2 relationship. This unit of Figure 17 has a number of design forming fragments which reach the shorter sides at their mid points and which reach the longer sides at two positions equally placed from the unit corners. This arrangement of the fragments of the design permits the units to be re assembled in a variety of relationships producing a large number of differing designs for the reasons already discussed. In the lower portion of Figure 17 such a design is shown with a number of the units combined.In addition to Ihe main unit N, additional units 0 and P are shown which include only a portion of the design.These units are useful in finishing off the edge portions of a larger pattern. The units 0, for example, are shc W finishing off the top of the design and the P units are shown completing the left hand margin of this design. Figure 18 illustrates the same basic units arranged in a differing pattern with the relative horizontal and vertical positions re arranged in a differing pattern and with theN and 0 units again forming a margin.Figure 19 shows a further and differing design or arrangement using these same rectangular units.Figures 20, 21 and 22 illustrate still further arrangements of the rectangular N units arranged in differing positions giving differing overall patterns. Areas for use of these units include interior and exterior walls, facades, floor coverings, and a variety of other exposed surfaces or structures. The units may be in the form of bricks, blocks, wall panelling, tiles, and other building materials. Also railings, tracery metal enclosures, balconies, fences, doors, window frames, parapets and other enclosing materials made from metal and manufactured by different methods of cold and hot metal treatment such as casting, chasing, pressing, carving, forging, bending, netting, welding, etc. Also carpet may be designed in accordance with the invention to permit the formation of various decorative floor designs and to allow a change of the design periodically by interchanging the positions of separate unit carpets.Also the invention may be used for games of differing degrees of complexity based on the forming of numbers of decorative, artistic compositions from a limited number of units including games with the application of poligrafic means, volumetric and applied games, mechanic games with image illuminations, etc.As various changes may be made in the form, construction and arrangement of te parts and steps herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention and without sacrificing any of its advantages, it is to be understood that all matter herin is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
