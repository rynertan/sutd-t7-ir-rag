# AN X RAY DIFFRACTION CAMERA

## Abstract
An X ray diffraction camera 10 which rotates a sample 25 about two generally normal axes A,B while simultane ously rotating the sample 25 about a third axis which changes in angular relationship relative to the two normal axes A,B , said camera 10 further providing linear reciproca tion of the sample 25 along said third axis.
