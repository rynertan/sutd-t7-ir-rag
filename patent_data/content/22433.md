# A method of producing objects with a thickness of more than 100 micrometer from rapidly quenched non equilibrium powders.

## Abstract
A method of producing large objects from rapidly quenched non equilibrium powders in which the powder is first slowly precompacted to a predetermined density without causing any substantial temperature rise. The powder is then rapidly compacted by a shock wave having a short rise time. In this way thin surface regions on the particles are rapidly brought to melting to cause interwelding of the particles. These thin surface regions are then rapidly quenched by conduction of heat to the interior of the particles. Because of the very rapid heating and quenching, in the order of a few microseconds, degradation of the material is avoided.
