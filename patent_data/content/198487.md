# BITUMEN ADHESIVE AND WATERPROOFING MEMBRANES CONTAINING SAME

## Abstract
Pressure sensitive bitumen based adhesive composi tions are provided which comprise bitumen, oil, an iono meric elastomer, and gilsonite. The adhesives are particu larly useful as self adherent waterproofing layers in roofing. The presence of gilsonite can result in substantial increases in the shear strength of these adhesives at the relatively high temperatures encountered in roofing applications. Also provided are waterproofing membranes compris ing the inventive adhesive compositions.
