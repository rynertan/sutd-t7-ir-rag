# Adaptive equalizer for digital signals.

## Abstract
Baseband adaptive equalizer for digital signals, par ticularly suited to very high transmission rate telecommu nications systems. Said equalizer permits distorsions of transmission channel with time varying characteristics to be compensated for. The structure uses a transversal filter, the coefficients of which are continuously updated accord ing to a particular adaptive procedure.
