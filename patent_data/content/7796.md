# A work table with a guard device for a motor driven circular saw.

## Abstract
The work table 1 and guide device are for a circular saw which has a saw blade which can be raised through a slot 7 in a rotatable circular plate 6 forming a part of the work table. A guard 8 is mounted at the end of the upper arm 12 of a generally horizontal, U shaped mounting or carrier bow 13 , the lower arm 14 of which is attached to the lower side of the circular plate 6 so that the bow rotates with this plate. The lower arm 14 of the mounting bow has an arc shaped por tion 14b connecting an outer portion 14c of the arm with an inner portion 14d which is angularly offset about the axis of rotation of the plate relative to the outer portion. Two adjacent legs 4, 5 of the work table are positioned or shaped so as to allow movement of the arc shaped portion 14b of the lower arm outside one leg 5 and inside the other 4 , thereby allowing a large angle of rotation of the circular plate 6 and the mounting bow 13 without said bow interfering with the legs of the work table.

## Description
A WORK TXIM WITH A GUARD DEVICE FOR A MOTOR DRIVEN CIRCULAR SAW The present invention relates to a work table with a guard device for a.motor driven circular saw of the type in which the saw blade spindle is mounted in a mounting frame and the saw blade extends through a slot in tbe wor table which has several legs, the mounting frame being suspended from a circular plate in which the slot is provided and which is rotatably mounted relative to the rest of the work table, a guard positioned above the slot being attached to the upper arm oP a bow which is substantially U shaped in elevation and extends outside the edge of the work table, its lower arm lying under the table and being connected to the circular plate for rotation with this plate, Such a bow shaped carrier device for a guard is prescribed by the Swedish labour Inspection Authorities and is also imown from Norwegian Patent ApplicationNo. 77 0660. Such a bow will necessarily interfere with the legs of the work table when rotating together with the circular plate.Usually it will be possible simply by designing one or more of the legs in special manners or by displacing the legs to obtain a total rotatory movement of 900, which is an absolute minimumHowever, it is desirable for the circular plate to be rotatable at least 450 in both directions from a cross cutting position of the saw blade, for producing a bevel cutting, and at the same time it will be advantageous if the plate can be rotated 90 in one direction from the position of the plate and the saw blade during cross cutting, so as to allow use of the saw for ripping. This means that it is highly desirable if the saw blade and the circular plate and thereby the carrier bow for the guard can be rotated an angle of at least 135 in total. The present invention aims at providing a guard of the type ref erred to initially, allowing a rotation of the saw blade and the circular plate of at least 1350 without amy substantial reduction of the stability of the work table. The worTh sanle and guard device for achieving this is accordinD to the invention characterized in that the lower alt or the bow in plan view comprises a substantially arc shaped portion connecting an outer portion of the lower arm of the bow with an inner portion which is angularly offset relative to the outer portion about the axis of rotation of the plate, said arc shaped portion lying at a distance from the axis of rotation of the plate such as to move inside one of the legs of the work table, but outside an adjacent leg.To allow the arc shaped portion to be passed outside the said adjacent leg, this leg may be connected to the work table in a position which is closer to the axis of rotation of the plate than the distance from this axis to the said one leg. Alternatively the said adjacent leg may be shaped with an outwardly open U shaped portion through which the arc shaped portion can be passed. An embodiment of the invention will be described in more detail below, by way of example, reference being had to the drawing. Figure 1 is a plan view of a work table with a guard device according to the invention, a part of the table plate of the work table being removed to show underlying parts. The suspension of the saw blade and the motor below the work table is not shown. Figure 2 is a cross section through the work table with guard device on the line II II in Figure 1 Figure 3 Is an elevation of a corner of the work table from the line III III in Figure 1 Figure 4 is a perspective view of the guard with the carrier bow therefor and the circular plate to which the carrier bow is connected. As already mentioned in connection with Figure 1, the saw blade, the saw blade spindle, the prime mover of the saw an a pivotal mounting frame on which the saw blade spindle is mounted, are not shown as these parts form no part of the present invention. Structures serving as a fence for the wcrk piece etc. are also not shown for sake of simplicity, since also these structures are not relevant to the invention. The same is true for a possible guard for the part of the saw blade alw s positioned below the table. In the Doc iment illustrated the saw has a work table having a rectangular table plate 1 and four legs 2, 3, 4 and 5. The table plate 1 has a circular opening for rotatable mounting of a circular plate 6 forming a support for the work to be sawn, and lying flush with the rest of the table plate 1. In the circular plate 6 there is provided a slot 7 through which the saw blade not illustrated can be raised.The mounting frame for the saw blade spindle is of course suspended from the plate 6 so as to rotate together with this plate, and the saw blade will rotate together with the slot 7. Deans for rotating the plate 6 and locking it in various positions relative to the table 1 as well as means for raising the mounting frame and locking it in positions in which the saw blade protrudes through the slot 7, are not shown in the drawing, since they do not relate to the invention. The guard device according to the invention comprises a guard 8 which on top carries a rod 9 which is guided in a sleeve 10. The rod 9 may be locked in a desired position in the sleeve 10 by means of a set screw having a knob 11. The sleeve 10 is rigidly connected to the upper arm 12 of a horizonbally positioned bow 13 which extends outside the edge of Ue work table 1 and inwardly below the table, its lower arn 14 being connected to the circular plate . ihe means 9 to 11 for adjustable suspension of the guard 8 in the upper arm 12 of the bow 13 constitutes a strongly simplified example of the manner in which the guard may be suspended, and it will be understood that the connection between the guard and the upper arm 12 may be made in various other ways. The lower arm 14 of the bow 13 consists of a number of ditterent portions. At its outer end the arm 14 has an attachment portion 14a which contacts the lower siso of the plate 6 parallel to the slot 7 and is for instance welded to the plate 6 or connected trerQto in other ways. The most characteristic feature of the lower arm 14 of the bow 13 is a.substantially arc shaped portion 14b, which connects an outer portion 14c with an inner portion 14d which is angularly offset about the axis of rotation of the plate 6 relative to the outer portion 14c.The inner portion 14d is parallel to the attachment portion 14a, but may be positioned somewhat below the attachment portion1 the portions 14a and 14d being interconnected by a cranked portion 14e in order to provide a clearance between the portion 14d and the lower side of the work table 1. As shown in Figure 3 one of the four legs is shaped somewhat differently from the other. Thus, the leg 5 at its upper end ends in an angle bar 15 which is connected to the work table at 16, i.e. in a position which is closer to the axis of rotation of the plate than is the leg 4. As a consequence of this design of the leg 5 the portion 14b of the bow 13 is movable outside the leg 5 at the upper end thereof, but inside the leg 4. It will be understood that this effect can be achieved with a number of other designs arid an. roements of the leg. The leg 5 may for instance have an outwardly open U shaped portion further down on the leg. Alternatively the leg 5 may extend straight down from the position 16 or possibly extend obliquely outwards from this position to provide the desired support. From the position.of the plate 6 shown in solid lines in Figure 1, which position constitutes the cross cutting position of the saw, the plate with the bow 13 may be rotated to the position of the bow illustrated by dash dot dot lines at 13 . Further rotation is prevented by abutment of the outer portion 14c of the lower arm 14 of the bow 13 with the leg 4.This is a position in which the plate 16 has been rotated gGO relative to the shown cross cutting position and which constitutes the ripping position of the saw. Additionally the saw may be rotated 450 in the opposite direction to the dash dot position of the bow 13 illustrated at 13 . In this position the inner portion 14d of the lower arm of the bow will abut the angle bar 15 of the leg 5. Thus, the angular displacement of the portions l4c and 14d of the bow adds to the rotational movement permitted between the legs 4 and 5 when a bow having a straight lower arm is used. Thereby it is possible to obtain the desired rotation of the saw without displacing or weakening the legs of the work table in a man er which might reduce the stability of the table. If the sa is of the type in which the saw blade is tilted, ether the guard 8 must have a shape permitting such tilting of the saw blade inside the guard, or the Zow with the guard must be tiltable in a correspocing manner so that the guard will follow also r felting movenent of the saw blade.This is not illustrated in the drawing, since it does not relate t the invention, and it will be evident to one skllLeo it the art how such a tiltable mounting may be obtained.
