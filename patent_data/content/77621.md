# ELECTRICAL HEATING SYSTEM

## Abstract
An electrical heating system for use in heating surfaces. A heating element is constructed of mesh screen comprised of nonferrous, small gauge metal wires which are spaced in a cloth mesh arrangement such that the total surface area of the wires is substantially equal to or greater than the adjacent area of the surface to be heated. The heating element is positioned substantially parallel to and adjacent the surface to be heated. The heating system includes electronic circuitry which essentially eliminates transmission of power surges, voltage spikes and chatter when the heating system is connected to an alternating current power source. The heating system also includes protective circuits and devices for preventing injury or damage due to transfor mer overheating, or due to under current or over current conditions. An optional electronic circuit permits use of the device for preventing formation of ice on surfaces in an efficient and economical manner.
