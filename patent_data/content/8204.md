# Carburetion by evaporation and capillary action.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with carburetion of gaso line for the purpose of reducing the consumption of gaso line and preventing pollution. The procedure for carrying out this function is by evaporation and osmosis. In the low er chamber 14 of the carburetor where the liquid gaso line is located are immersed a plurality of special tubes 5 . The tubes 5 have in their lower portion on the inside sur face an absorbant material, and wicks extending therefrom. In the upper portion of the tubes where the wicks are lo cated, there are a plurality of lateral openings 5e . The gasoline is located in a lower chamber 14 where the tu bes 5 are immersed. The uper portion of the tubes are not immersed in the gasoline. When the motor is turned on, the intake valve 4 opens and air is drawn through the air filter 2 in the carburetor and down into the tubes 5 . The air contacts the wicks in the tubes 5 , vapor is form ed, and passes through the openings 5e thereof into a chamber which has a protective material 7 located there in. From this chamber, the vapors of gasoline pass into the intake tube 9 and are metered by the butterfly valve 10 for delivery to the manifold and distribution to the cyliners of the engine. There is also provided a valve 13 in proxi mity to the intake arrangement to insure the release of any back pressure which develops during a backfire. This valve is designed to open automatically and release the pressure so as to prevent damage within the carburetor.
