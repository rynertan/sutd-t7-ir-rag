## Description
An apparatus and method for accurately rreasuring temperature differences. The invention relates to a cell and an apparatus for accurately measuring temperature differences between two environments. Devices are known for measuring vapor pressure differences.Such devices are ccmmonly referred to as differential vapor pressure cells hereinafter referred to as dVp cells . The dVp cells comprise a first chamber containing a reference material at a given pressure.The first chamber is in fluid communication with a reservoir maintained in the environment of interest and containing a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid i.e., a quantity of liquid insufficient to fill the combination of the reservoir and the first chamber . A second chamber, separated from the first chamber by a diaphragm, is directly connected and exposed to the medium whose differential vapor pressure is measured with respect to the vapor pressure of the fluid in the reservoir chamber combination. In chemical processes, it is often desirable to accurately measure a relatively small difference in temperature. For example, it is generally desirable for optimum control of a manual or fully automatic process, to establish an accurate heat balance. This requires as accurate a determination as possible of the difference between the temperature of the reaction mixture entering the reactor and the temperature of the reaction mixture leaving the reactor and or the difference between the temperature of the heat exchange medium supplied and the temperature of the heat exchange medium discharged.In many cases, this temperature difference to be measured is only in the order of a few degrees centigrade. Therefore,errors in the measured temperature difference ,which , in absolute sense, are small , can be very significant in a relative sense i.e., as a percentage of the temperature difference , thereby limiting optimum process control. The temperature differences determined by taking the difference between two temperatures measured by means of existing apparatus, such as thermistors, thermocouples, resistance temperature detectors and the like have not, in practice, been found to be sufficiently accurate. Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention is a differential temperature cell hereinafter referred to as X cell useful in measuring the difference in temperatures between two environments.The dT cell ctprises a first reservoir being in fluid communication with a first chamber having at least a portion of one wall being a diaphragm which also forms at least a portion of a wall of a second chamber and a means for measuring the pressure difference between the pressures of the first and second chambers. The second chamber is in fluid communication with a second reservoir. In another aspect, the invention is an apparatus for measuring temperature differences using the dT cell. In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus comprises the dr cell and a means for determining the temperature adjacent or of one of the reservoirs, the temperature difference between the fluids in the two reservoirs being determinable fran the measured pressure difference and the pre determined temperature. The invention also provides a method for accurately measuring temperature differences between two environments, which method comprises determining the temperature T1 and pressure P1 of a first fluid corresponding to the temperature of a first enviranment and measuring the difference in pressure between the first fluid and a second fluid at a second temperature corresponding to the temperature of a second environment.For example, using the described apparatus, the temperature T1 and the pressure P1 of a first fluid contained in the first reservoir the temperature of which corresponds to the temperature of a first environment are determined and the difference in pressure P between the first fluid and a second fluid contained in said second reservoir the temperature of which corresponds to the temperature of a second environment are measured. Subsequently, the pressure P2 of the second fluid is calculated from P1 and the measured pressure difference P , the temperature T2 of the second fluid is calculated from the pressure P2 and subsequently the temperature difference T2 T1 calculated. Although various equations relating temperature and pressure can be employed, preferably, the fluid contained by each reservoir chamber combination is a liquid in equilibrium with its vapor and the vapor pressure of a liquid at a certain temperature is interrelated using the formula EMI3.1 wherein A, B, C are constants,T temperature OC , and p pressure mm Hg . It has been found that the apparatus and method according to the invention, as will be described in trore detail hereinafter, permits measuring temperature differences in the order of a few degrees centigrade with an accuracy that is 4 to 25 times greater than is possible with prior systems. The invention will be described in more detail hereinafter with reference to the drawings. In said drawings, Fig. 1 is diagrammatic representation of a dVp cell of the prior art Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic representation of an embodiment of the dT cell of the invention Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic representation of a dT cell of the invention prepared using two dVp cells Fig. 4 is a diagrammatic representation of one embodiment of the invention for use in measuring temperature differences and Fig. 5 graphically shows the relation between the temperature and the vapor pressure of a n butane. Fig. 1 diagrammatically shows prior art dVp cell for measuring differences in vapor pressure. In the depicted dVp cell, there is provided a single reservoir vessel 1 ,filled with a fluid preferably, a liquid vapor , in fluid communication with a first chamber 2. The reservoir 1 is disposed within a conduit 23 containing a material 24, the differential vapor pressure of which material is to be measured. One wall of chamber 2 is formed by a diaphragm 5. Disposed at the other side of diaphragm 5, is a chamber 4 directly connected by means of a conduit 22 to the interior of conduit 23 containing material or medium 24. A measuring device 6 is capable of determining the difference in pressure of the fluids in chamber 2 and 4. In operation, the difference in the vapor pressure of material 24 between the point where the reservoir 1 is positioned in conduit 23 and the point where the conduit 22 enters the conduit 23 is determined, with respect to the vapor pressure of the liquid vapor contained in the combinatiDn of reservoir 1 and chamber 2, by the differential pressure measurement device 6. The dT cell of the present invention, as illustrated inFig. 2, comprises a first reservoir 1 in fluid ccmmunication with a first chamber 2. A diaphragm 5 forms a wall or at least a portion of a wall of the first clamber 2, as well as a wall or at least a portion of a wall of a second chamber 4. The second chamber 4 is in fluid ccmmunicatian with a second reservoir 3. Reservoirs 1 and 3 contain a fluid, preferably a liquid vapor combinaticn. A device 6 is capable of measuring the differences in pressure between the fluids contained in chambers 2 and 4. Alternatively, in order that dVp cells can be employed in the apparatus according to the invention,the dT cell can be prepared as shown in Fig. 3 from two commercial dVp cells. As depicted in thisFig., a first chanber 2 of a first dVp cell t7 is in fluid communication with a reservoir 1. A second chamber 4 of the first dVp cell 17 is separated framthe first chamber 2 by a diaphragm 5. The second chamber 4 is in fluid communication, through a balance line 8, to a first chamber 7 of a second dVp cell 18. The first chamber 7 of cell 18 is divided first a second chamber 29 by a diaphragm 25.A measuring device 6 is suitable for measuring the pressure differences existing in chambers 2 and 4 of the first cell 17. A measuring device 26 optionally employed is suitable for measuring the pressure differences existing between chambers 7 and 29 of the second dVp cell 18. In the depicted embodimEnt, since the pressure in chamber 4 of first dVp cell 17, after correction for elevation, and in chamber 7 of second dVp cell 18 are the save, it is not necessary to connect the second chamber 4 of dUp cell 17 directly to a reservoir, as chamber 7 is in fluid communication with the reservoir 3. The use of the dT cell in measuring temperature differences is explained by reference to Fig. 4 ,which is a schematic representation, partially in cross section, of a system comprising the apparatus of the invention for measuring the temperature difference between the interior of conduit 9 and the interior of conduit 10. Although Fig. 4 depicts the use of the dT cell of Fig. 2 in measuring temperature differences, temperature differences can also be determined using the dT cell depicted by Fig. 3, using saaaar techniques. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 4, the reservoir 1, which is in fluid coitrttunication with first chamber 2, is disposed in toe interior of conduit 9 and the reservoir 3, which is in fluid communication with second chamber 4, is disposed in the interior of conduit 10.An element 12 capable of measuring temperature is also disposed within conduit 9, adjacent reservoir 1. For this purpose,any known temperature sensor of sufficient accuracy itay be used as the sensor. A computing means 13 is connected to the temperature sensor 12 by means of a lead 19 and to the differential pressure measuring device 6 by means of a lead 20. In the operation of the apparatus depicted in Fig. 4, the fluid in reservoir 1 exhibits a pressure P1 corresponding to the temperature T1 of the interior of conduit 9 and the fluid in reservoir 3 exhibits a pressure P2 corresponding to the temperature T2 of the interior of conduit 10. To optimize accuracy, the chambers and the conduit, if any, connecting a chamber with a reservoir are preferably insulated to minimize temperature differences between the reservoir and the chamber to which they are connected. The difference in pressure AP between P1 and P2 is measured by measuring device 6.The temperature T1 of the interior of conduit 9 is measured by sensor 12. The temperature difference between the interiors of conduits 9 and 10 can then be calculated from AP and T1 by initially calculating pressure P1 of the fluid in chamber 2 from the known temperature T1, using an equation suitably relating temperature and pressure. The pressure P2 of the fluid in the second chamber 4 is then calculated frante calculated P1 and the measured pressure difference AP, using the equation P1 AP P2. The temperature T2 of the fluid in the second chamber 4, which corresponds to the temperature of the interior of conduit 10 is then calculated, using an equation suitably relating pressure and temperature.The difference between the temperature of the fluid contained in reservoir 1, which corresponds to the temperature of the interior of conduit 9 and the temperature of the fluid contained in reservoir 3, which corresponds to the temperature of the interior of conduit 10,can then be calculated. In actual practice of the embodiment of Fig. 4, a measurable signal e.g., electrical current, varying with the pressure difference AP is supplied to computing means 13 by means of lead 20. A measurable signal, e.g., electrical current, varying with the temperature measured by sensor 12 is fed to computing means 13 by means of lead 19.Fram these input signals ,computing means 13 determines the difference in temperature between the interior of conduits 9 and 10. Alternatively, using the dT cell depicted in Fig. 3, if the pressure exhibited by a fluid contained in the second chamber 29 of dVp cell 18 is kncwn, the temperature difference can also be determined using the following techniques.The absolute vapor pressure P2 in the first chamber 7 of the second cell 18 is determined from the known pressure Pk in chamber 29 and the difference in pressure AP measured by the pressure measuring device 26, using the equationP2 Pk Ap. To obtain maximum accuracy, the pressure Pk is preferably within or as close as possible to the expected pressure range of P2 to be measured from pk and APt. Subsequently, the temperature T2 of the fluid contained by the reservoir 3 can be calculated, using an equation e.g. Antoine equation relating temperature and pressure. The pressure P1 of the fluid contained in chamber 2 of the first cell 17 is then calculated from P2 and the difference in pressure measured by device 6 i.e., P1 P2 bP3 The temperature T1 of the fluid contained in reservoir I and chamber 2 is calculated and the difference in temperature is also calculated i.e. AT T1 T2 . The e relation between the vapor pressure and the temperature for a given liquid is preferably calculated using the so calledAntoine equation 10logp A B T C whereinA, B,C are constants, the so called Antoine constantsT temperature OC , and p pressure mm Hg . The value of the Antoine constants can be read from a chemical handbook such as the twelfth edition of Lange s Handbook of Chemistry, edited by John A. Dean, published by McGraw Hill, pages 10 28 to 10 54 and other editions of this book and similar chemical handbooks. In the practice of the invention, although the fluid contained in the reservoir chamber combinations of the dT cell can be a material which remains gaseous throughout the entire temperature range to which it is exposed, in general, the fluid is advantageously a liquid exhibiting a vapor pressure at the temperatures expected. For ttst accurate determination of temperature differences, a wide variation in the vapor pressure of the liquid with small differences in temperature at the temperatures expected is desired.In addition, the vapor pressure exhibited by the liquid employed in the dT cell preferably varies relatively linearly with temperature over the temperature range to be measured. Specifically, by reference to Figure 5, the difference in the vapor pressure exhibited by a liquid for a specific difference in temperature will generally vary with changes in absolute temperature. For example, the vapor pressure of n butane, as calculated using the Antoine equation, is, for the various temperatures specified below 80C P 1041.0 ttmHg 100C P 1117.3 ttrnHg 230C P 1723.6 mm Hg 250C P 1835.7 ttrn HgFrom this Table, the difference in vapor pressure, AP, is found to vary for the same AT of 20C depending on the different temperatures involved.Specifically, at T1 100C, T2 800C the difference in vapor pressure is 76.3 mm Hg, whereas the difference in vapor pressure at T1 250C and T2 2300C is 112.1 rtrn Hg. The accuracy of a pressure measuring device is typically from 0.1 to 0.7 percent of the range set. The absolute error is the product of this accuracy times the range i.e., 0.001 to 0.007 x 112.1 0.11 to 0.78 mm Hg.At T1 250C and T2 230C, this error corresponds to an absolute error in the temperature difference of 0.002 to O.0140C i.e., fran 0.1 to 0.7 percent error , whereas at T1 100C and T2 80C this error corresponds to an absolute error in the temperature difference of 0.0030 to 0.0200C or maximally 1 . As shown, at a specified temperature difference, using the sane fluid in each reservoir chamber ccebination, the error depends on the differences in the pressure difference exhibited at the highest and lowest temperature to be expected.This error becomes less as the difference in AP at the highest and lowest temperature is minimized, i.e.,the error is minimized as over the vapor pressure difference exhibited by the liquid at a specific temperature difference approaches a constant value over the entire temperature range of interest In general, to create the maximum changes in pressure with small changes in teçperature and the minimum changes in the differences of Ap at a specific temperature difference over the temperature range of interest, the fluid is preferably a liquid which exhibits a vapor pressure, the in vapor pressure not exceeding the design pressure of the dT cell, at the temperatures of interest. The liquid employed also preferably has a boiling point less than or equal to the lowest temperature encountered by the dT cell during its operation and a critical temperature above the highest temperature to be expected. In addition, the liquid will preferably not decompose at the temperatures eepcted. The liquid preferably employed will vary depending on the temperatares to which the fluid is exposed which will generally vary from 200 C to 5000C, the choice of the specific dT cell employed will deFend e.g. on the maximum and minimum difference in vapor pressure capable of being measured by the cell and the sYimum expected pressure of the fluid, the desired accuracy and the like.In general, aliphatics and substituted aliphatics such as the alkanes and alkenes of up to 12 carbon items e.g., methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propene, i butane, n bitane, l butene, isobutene, i hexane, n hexane, l hexene, i pentane, l pentene and the like the alicyclics and substituted alicyclics e.g., cyclohexane and the like and water, particularly the aliphatics and substituted aliphatics and alicyclics and substituted alicyclics, are preferred for use in the dT cell for temperatures up to 350oC. Alkanes, alkenes and substituted alkenes or alkanes of up to six carbon atoms, particularly ,alkenes such as ethylene, propylene, l butene, isobutylene or l hexene, are preferred for use with temperatures of up to about 200 C, with methane, ethylene and propylene being preferred at temperatures from 2000C to 200C.Since the vapor pressures of methane, and ethylene and propylene at higher temperatures, e.g., above 100 to 1500C, can exceed the design pressure of the dT cell, these liquids are preferably not employed at these higher temperatures and less volatile liquids are used. At higher temperatures, e.g., above 5000C, mercury or a liquid which at normal temperatures is a solid such as liquefied sodium, are more preferably employed. In general, the fluid in both reservoir chamber combinations of the dT cell will be the same. However, it is possible and sometimes advantageous to use different fluids in the reservoir chamber combinations of the dT cell. The fluid is placed in the dT cell using conventional techniques for placing a fluid in a dVp cell. The liquid is placed in the reservoir chamber combination in an amount sufficient such that, at the temperatures of interest, the liquid never becomes completely vaporized, i.e., during operation the reservoir chaiter combination always contains a liquid with its vapor. To indicate the excellent accuracy obtained by the method and apparatus of the invention, it is presumed that the temperature range to be expected will vary from Sa to 25 0C, that the actual temperatur difference will be 20C and that n butane is contained by both reservoirs of the dT cell. The Antoine constant for n butane are A 6.927 B 988.33 C 244.8 The vapor pressure of n butane, as calculated using these constants and the Antoine equation hereinbefore described, is 1723.6 rtrtt Hg for a temperature of 23 C and 1835.7 rtrn Hg for a temperature of 2500. Therefore, the EP for temperatures of 23 and 250C is 1835.7 1723.6 mm Hg or 112.1 mm Hg. Using Fig. 4 for purposes of illustrating this example, it is presumed that the actual temperature of the fluid in the first reservoir 1 is 230C and the actual temperature of the fluid in the second reservoir 3 is 25 C. In measuring the actual temperature, the error of a calibrated temperature sensor is typically less than 0.05 C. Therefore, the temperature measured by means of the sensor 12 can vary from 22.95 to 23.05 C, with 22.950C beings selected as the measured temperature instead of 23 C. From the Antoine equation, the vapor pressure P1 calculated using T1 22.95 C is 1720.9 mm Hg. The calculated vapor pressure P2 in reservoir 3 with the higher temperature will be 1720.9 t 112.1 1833 mm Hg. The corresponding temperature T1 of the fluid in reservoir 3 is then calculated to be 24.952 C. The calculated temperature difference then beconuts 24.952 22.950 2.002 C. As compared with the actual temperature difference of 20C, this leads to an error of only 0.1 . Using the method of the invention, a similarly small error is found for temperature differences of up to 1200 when the temperature of the higher temperature fluid is 25 C. For example, an error of 0.12 was calculated at a temperature difference of 5 C i.e., T1 25 C, T2 20 C 0.11 at a temperature difference of 1000 i.e., T1 15 C, T2 250C and 0.11 at a temperature difference of 1200 i.e., T1 1300 and T2 25 C . The accuracy of the measurement of the pressure difference i.e., the accuracy of the dT cell will generally be in a range from 0.1 to 0.7 percent. Therefore, the overall error in measurement of the temperature difference for To 25 C varies from 0.2 to 0.8 i.e., 0.1 for the error due to the inaccuracy of the temperature sensor plus the 0.1 to 0.7 error due to the inaccuracy of the dT cell , which corresponds to 0.004 to 0.016 for a AT of 2 C, from 0.0010 to 0.04 C for a T ot 50 and from 0.02 to 0.081 C at 1000 and from 0.025 to 0.1 C for a AT of 1200. It is evident that, although the relative error varies very little, the absolute error in the temperature difference is dependent on the magnitude of the temperature difference to be measured. If the temperature difference between the interiors of conduits 9 and 10 is determined by means of two separate sensors, such as sensor 12, the total error. assuming an accuracy of each temperature sensor of 0.05 C,would be equal to 2 x 0.050C or 0.10C. This corresponds to a 5 percent error for a temperature difference of 2 degrees. Therefore, especially small differences in temperature are measured much more accurately by the method and apparatus according to the invention than by means of existing temperature sensors. By this example, the apparatus and method of the invention, for a temperature difference of 20C have been shown to give a result which is 6 to 25 times more accurate than prior systems. With a temperature difference of 12 C, the accuracy of the method according to the invention is at least equal to that which can be obtained by means of known differential temperature measurements.
