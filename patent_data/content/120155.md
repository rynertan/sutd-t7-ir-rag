## Description
SHOT CONCENTRATOR SHOT GUN CARTRIDGE LOADING I, ALBERT VICTOR GREEN, of British Nationatity, The Bungalow, Slade, Kingsbridge, Devon, TQ 7 4 BL., in the United Kingdom of Great Britain, do hereby declare the invention for which I pray, a European patent may be granted to me, and the method by which it is to be performed to be particularly described in and by the following statement The concentrator 2 is used in conjunction with the shot sheath type plastic wadX1 now almost standard in the loading of shot gun cartridgs, in which the whole shot charge is enclosed within the sheath 3 the sheath being split or sectioned to form four leaves which arrange for flexibility.The 2 concentrator, here inafter referred to as the ring takes the form of a number of turns or whipping of cotton or silk thread wound on to the outside of the leaves at 5 m m from the front or opan end. A bur3 ing pressure or force within the sheath when the cartridge is fired brought about by the immense forward thrust of the wad 1 seats the ring in it s own groove in the plastic thus preventing any shift or movement fro it1s original position on the sheath. 3 Upon emerging from the gun muzzle the leaves of the sheath ar held or constricted by the ring which prevents them splaying open, as happens when no ring is fitted, instantly shedding the shot and producing normal 1scatter of the shot The effect of this constricting action is to delay the moment when wad and shot part company thus concentrating the shot much more closely in the target area, than would be the case were there to be no ring fitted. No problem can arise with internal barrell pressure since the outside diameter of the ring is no greater than the minimum diameter of a gun barrell bore which has maximum choke, I m m constriction . 8. A shot concentrator 2 used in conjunction with the shot sheath type plastic shot gun cartridge wads I , which takes the form of any type or form of plastic ring placed on to the outside of the leaves of the sheath at the front end.
