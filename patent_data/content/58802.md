# Solder.

## Abstract
A solder is disclosed for joining a wide variety of metals or their alloys to themselves or to other metals or alloys, and which solder comprises from 80 percent to 40 percent by mass of thin and from 60 percent to 20 percent by mass of zinc. A preferred solder comprises about 75 percent of tin and 25 percent of zinc.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A solder for joining a wide variety of metals or their alloys to themselves or to other metals or other alloys comprising tin and zinc, the amount of tin not exceeding 80 percent nor being less than 40 percent by mass, and the amount of zinc not exceeding 60 percent nor being less than 20 percent by mass. 2. A solder according to claim 1 in which the solder contains 75 percent of tin and 25 percent of zinc by mass. 3. The use of a solder comprising no more than 80 percent nor less than 40 percent by mass of tin and no more than 60 percent nor less than 20 percent by mass of zinc, for joining a wide variety of metals or their alloys to themselves or to other metals or other alloys. 4. The use of a solder in accordance with claim 3 in which the solder contains 75 percent of tin and 25 percent of zinc by mass.

## Description
Improvements in solders THIS INVENTION relates to solders and is particularly concerned with solders which can be used successfully to join a wide variety of different metals. The prior art is replete with technical details concerning an infinite number of compositions useful as solders. Some of such compositions have very specific uses while others have more general use. Some metals are notoriously difficult to solder either to themselves or to other metals, and a particular example of such a metal is aluminium. It is an object of the present invention to provide a solder which is not only easy to produce, but which may also be used for a wide variety of metals. According to the invention there is provided a solder comprising tin and zinc, the amount of tin not exceeding 80 percent nor being less than 40 percent by mass and the amount of zinc not exceeding 60 percent nor being less than 20 percent by mass. In the preferred form of the invention the solder contains 75 percent by mass of tin and 25 percent by mass of zinc. It will be appreciated that traces of other metals may be present in the solder and a typical analysis of such traces is as follows Copper 0,006 0,01 percent by weight Iron 0,025 0,065 percent by weight Lead 0,05 0,4 percent by weight The solder of the invention may be used for soldering together any of the following metals to themselves or to any other or others Aluminium and its alloys to other metals and alloysMagnesiumPewterZinc and its alloysCopper and its alloysBrass and its alloysBronze and its alloysStainless steelChrome steelNickel alloy steelsTungsten steelsHigh speed steelsMild steelsGalvanised ironTin plate.
