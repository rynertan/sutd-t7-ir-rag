# Electrolytic cell having an improved ion exchange membrane and process for operating.

## Abstract
An electrolytic cell and a process for electrolysis using the cell are provided. The electrolytic cell is separated into an anode chamber and a cathode chamber by a fluorinated polymer membrane wherein the membrane comprises a at least 60 mole percent CFX CFâ‚‚ where X F or Cl b an ion exchange equivalent weight of at least 600 c pendant sulfonyl ion exchange groups and d pendant substantially fluorinated carbon groups which have no ion exchange functionality. These cells are particularly useful for the electrolysis of aqueous, alkali metal halides.
