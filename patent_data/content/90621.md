# COMBINATION DIE AND DIE SUPPORT STRUCTURES

## Abstract
The task of securing dies 26, 36 of a die set 24 to appro priate supports 15, 16 such as for example, the die shoes of a set of die shoes or to upper and lower platens 12 of a punch press so that the dies are in precise alignment can be simplified by utilising expandable diameter fasteners 48, 50 to secure the dies to the supports. Each fastener used is located within a hole 44 extending through one of the dies and within an aligned hole 46 in the adjacent support. The fasteners used are of such a character as to be capable of firmly securing the dies and the supports even if such holes of a set of such holes are of not precisely the same diameter. Preferably each die is secured in place utilising at least two of such fasteners.
