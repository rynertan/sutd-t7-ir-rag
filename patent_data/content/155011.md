## Description
hIGH STRENGTH ALLOY FOR INDUSTRIAL VESSELS The instant invention relates to nickel iron chromium alloys in general and more particularly to a high strength, corrosion resistant alloy having a low work hardenability rate with variable age hardenable characteristics. The alloy reduces copper pick up in fluid streams. Power plant operators and boiler manufacturers recognized early on that to improve the efficiency of steam generators both fossil and nuclear , it was useful to adopt regenerative feedwater heating. Essentially, steam is extracted from the steam turbines to preheat the boiler reactor feedwater before it is introduced into the economizer of a boiler or directly into a steam generator reactor. The heating of the feedwater occurs in, naturally enough, feedwater heaters. Steam is used to heat the feedwater inside the feedwater heater tubing to impart a portion of the steam s latent heat to the water. Water temperatures from about 100 650 F 37.7 343.30C and pressures up to 5200 psi 358.53 MPa are not uncommon. Moreover, advanced designs are now contemplating pressures up to 7200 psi 496.42MPa and 7000F 371.10C . Currently, steels carbon and stainless and sometimes nickel copper alloys NONEL nickel copper alloys are utilized in feedwater heaters. Although the feedwater is treated to remove chemicals and other impurities, corrosion of the tubing may still occur. Free oxygen vill attack the steels. Superalloys are often difficult to form into tubes due to their high work hardening rates. High copper containing materials are generally frowned upon since copper and corrosion products are believed to deposit on boiler tubes and may be carried over into the steam. These undesirable entrained products may enter into the turbines resulting in lower efficiencies. Indeed, operators wish to eliminate all possible copper pick up in the steam because of fouling and the resulting loss of efficiency of the turbine blades when the copper plates out of the steam. It is also believed that the copper deposits may set up local galvanic cells with the ferrous alloys thereby causing additional corrosion.Operators wish to stay away from nickel copper alloys which otherwise display better chemical and physical properties than the other alloys. However, the substitution of low carbon or stainless steels for the nickel copper alloys currently available i not always satisfactory since these materials do not have the requisite corrosion resistance, stress corrosion cracking resistance or strength. This leads to high maintenance costs. Moreover, in the case of carbon steels, undesirably short lifetimes of three to eight years have been reported. Contrast this state of affairs with an expected service life in excess of twenty years. Accordingly, power plant operators are in a quandry steels corrode high alloys are costly and the nickel copper alloys contain high quantities of copper. It is apparent that there is a need for a reasonable cost alloy that exhibits corrosion resistance, strength and formability properties suitable for feedwater heaters, chemical and petrochemical installations and other similar applications. Accordingly, there is provided an austenitic alloy having a low work hardening rate especially suited for, but not limited to, A trademark of the Inco family of companies. industrial vessels and particularly for heat exchanger tubing for high temperature, high pressure applications. The instant alloy combines improved corrosion resistance and the requisite high strength in a system that is of lower cost than the more expensive higher alloys.The alloy displays good stress corrosion cracking resistance and good high temperature corrosion resistance. According to the invention, a high strength, corrosion resistant nickel iron chromium alloy consists, by weight, of from 24 to 32 nickel, from 12 to 19 chromium, molybdenum and copper in amounts up to 3.5 molybdenum and 5.5 copper, from 0 to 2.5 titanium, from 0 to 1.5 manganese, from 0 to 1.5 silicon, from 0 to 1 columbium niobium and tantalum, from 0 to 0.2 aluminum, from 0 to 0.1 cerium, from 0 to 0.01 boron and from 0 to 0.2 nitrogen, the balance, apart from impurities, being iron. The term impurities used herein includes residual amounts of calcium added as a processing aid. The molybdenum content is advantageously at least 1 , e.g.from 1 to 3 , and the copper content at least 2 , e.g. from 2 to 5 .Preferably the nickel content is from 26 to 29 , the chromium content from 15 to 18 , the molybdenum content not more than 3 , the copper content not more than 5 and the content of columbium and tantalum not more than 0.4 . In one alloy according to the invention the nickel is about 28 , the chromium about 16 , the molybdenum about 16 , the molybdenum about 2 and the copper about 4 . Owing to its low work hardening rate caused in part by the nickel chromium combinations the instant alloy easily lends itself to tube fabrication and other cold working operations.However, by varying the titanium content, age hardenable and nonage hardenable characteristics may be developed. Titanium levels below about 0.8 lead to a non age hardenable alloy whereas titanium levels above about 0.8 are increasingly age hardenable, and e.g. about 1.8 titanium may be incorporated for this purpose. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which yield stress is plotted against percentage reduction for an alloy according to the invention Alloy 16 and three comparative alloys. In the alloy of the invention, the incorporation of a measured quantity of titanium can impart an age hardening response of at least 60 ksi 413.7 MPa yield strength and 120 ksi 827.4 MPa tensile strength in the cold worked and annealed conditions. The titanium raises the work hardening rate of the alloy. Copper, chromium and molybdenum improve the corrosion resistance of the alloy. Aluminum, cerium, boron and calcium assist in the deoxidation of the alloy. Nitrogen may be added to the low titanium level alloys as an austenite former. It also serves to boost the ability of the alloy to withstand corrosive attack. The nitrogen raises the strength and increases the work hardening rate of the alloy in the annealed condition. Table I below sets forth the compositions of a number of heats within the above composition ranges and also, for purposes of comparison, one alloy No 4 that is substantially free from copper and molybdenum and three alloys Nos 13 15 having lower nickel contents. Some examples will now be given. EXAMPLE 1 This is an example of a low titanium, non age hardenable modification of the alloy No 12 . In a series of tests, specimens of this composition were evaluated for stress corrosion cracking SCC and high temperature water corrosion resistance. It was tested in the as cold rolled CR condition and after annealing and heat treating at 14000F 6000C and compared with annealed MONEL alloy 400 and Type 304 stainless steel. Stress corrosion cracking test results are given in Table 2.

General corrosion tests were conducted in deaerated water with coupons suspended from insulated hooks.Weight change in the water tests were determined by weighing uncleaned specimens after 500 hours and 1000 hours. The average corrosion rate was determined on cleaned specimens after 1000 hours. All test material was in the form of 0.125 inch gauge 0.32 cm x 2.5 inch 6.35 cm wide strip.

In a 6000F 1Z NaCl solution, only alloy 304 cracked within the 720 hour test. There was no evidence of SCC cracking in heat 12.

In summary, heat 12 displayed good SCC resistance and is expected to resist caustic and chloride SCC better than alloy 304. The higher nickel provides this improved SCC resistance. In the high temperature deaerated water test shown in Table 3 below, general corrosion rates in the alloy 12 were similar to 304 stainless and somewhat better than MONEL alloy 400.

Forged 9 16 inch 1.43 cm squares plus forged 3 4 x 2 x 12 inch 1.91 x 5.08 x 30.48 cm flats were made with frequent rebeats at 21500F 1177 C . After overhauling the flats to a uniform thickness, they were hot rolled to 1 4 inch 0.64 cm at 21500F. The hot rolled 1 4 inch strip was annealed at 1950 F 1066 C one hour water quench and pickled prior to cold rolling. Hardness and tensile tests were taken at various levels of cold work ta establish a work hardening response. A low work hardening rate is very desirable in the manufacture of relatively small diameter thin walled tubing. Of particular importance is the yield strength at high levels of cold reduction such as 60 to 805 reduction. Many tube mills produce s large hot vorked tube shell which must be reduced in size during a number of cold working and annealing stages. Experience has shown that alloys which have lower yield strength after high cold reductions may be cold worked to a greater degree without splitting, requiring less annealing stages and lower manufacturing costs. The Figure shows heat 16 to have a lower yield strength after a high cold reduction than heats 14 and 15 with lower nickel content. After a cold reduction of 60 to 80D, the yield strength of heat 16 is also lower than the commercial alloy INCOLOY alloy 800. INCOLOY alloy 800 is shown in the Figure for comparative purposes only.A general purpose alloy, it has good workability characteristics and is easily processed. The instant invention was developed vith these attributes in mind. All heats had good malleability. Tensile data on cold rolled strip using increasing amounts of titanium are shown in Tables 4, 5 and 6.

Indeed, the combination of about 20 cold reduction with a slightly lower titanium content might be optimum for feedwater heaters.

In the polythionic acid test all materials were tested annealed plus aged at 1350 F 1 hr, AC. Approximate Value The tests show that the instant alloy is more resistant toSCC caused by chlorides and sodium hydroxide than 304 stainless. The relatively high nickel content of the instant alloys provides the increased chloride and caustic cracking resistance. The test data also indicates very good resistance of the alloys to polythionic acid cracking. This is a common cause of failure of stainless steels and high nickel alloys in petrochemical service. The influence of high titanium content on carbide precipitation is believed to be responsible for good polythionic acid SCC resistance. Table 9 shows general corrosion test results. Tables 8 and 9 also demonstrates the resistance of the alloy to environments other than that posed by feedwater heaters. Molybdenum addition of 2 3X greatly improves resistance to hydrochloric acid.Copper additions of 4 or more improved sulfuric acid resistance. The combination of copper and molybdenum appears to improve resistance to phosphoric acid. The instant alloy lends itself to chemical and petro chemical applications. The design strength of the alloys destined for tubular applications is usually based on the tensile strength of the alloy comprising the apparatus. In the cold worked plus stress relieved conditions, the instant alloy system will meet the 120 ksi minimum tensile strength usually specified bv design engineers. This value, compares favorably with such alloys as Inoonel alloy 625 and Incoloy alloy 801. Table 10 compares minimum tubular vall thicknesses between HONEL alloy 400, 304 stainless and the instant alloy for various temperature and pressure conditions. Table 10 was constructed to compare the minimum wall thickness between the listed alloys. The next heavier standard wall thickness was used to calculate the weight per foot.

The time period is, of course, a function of the temperature selected and the section size. In particular, the non age hardenable tubes may be drawn to final size, annealed at about 1700 20000F 767 933iC for a suitable time, straightened, bent into the appropriate shape if desired , and stress relieved at about 1100 1400 F up to about three hours.

The low chromium lowers resistance to intergrannular attack and limits use in highly oxidizing environments vouch as nitric acid. A preferred composition for overall strength, corrosion resistance and economy for feedvater heaters is heat 8 28 Ni 16 Cr 4 Cu 1.8 Ti 2 Mo Bal Fe . This composition appears to have the mechanical and corrosion properties necessary for a high pressure material. It also has excellent general corrosion resistance in hydrochloric, sulfuric and phosphoric acids. The good resistance of this composition to polythionic acid attack also indicates potential petrochemical applications. While specific embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described herein, those skilled in the art will understand that certain features of the invention may sometimes be used to advantage without a corresponding use of the other features.
