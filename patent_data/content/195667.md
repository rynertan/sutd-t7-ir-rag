II Cardiotonic activity 1 Testing method Mongrel dogs adults female and male having a body weight of 8 15 kg were anaesthesized by injection iv. of sodium pentobarbital 30 mg kg .Under artificial respiration, a catheter type pressure transducer was inserted into the.left ventricle to measure the inner pressure. A catheter was inserted into the femoral artery to measure the peripheral blood pressure. The cardiac contractile force was measured by referring to the maximum value of the primary differential of the blood pressure in the left ventricle dp dt max. . The heart rate was measured by introducing ECG wave second induction into a tachometer. During the measuring, anaesthesia was continued by means of inhalation of halothane and N2O gas. Simultaneously with the anaesthesia, a muscle relaxant panchronium bromide was continuously injected into the vein at the left paw at a rate of 0.1 mg kg hour to stabilise the anaesthesia for a long period of time. Each test compound was dissolved in PEG 400 and administered into the vein at the right paw at a dose of 0.3 mg kg. For a period of 60 minutes the maximum rate of change of the cardiac contractile force and heart rate, as well as the average blood pressure, were measured and compared with the corres ponding values measured before administration. The duration of the change of the cardiac contractile 5 force was also measured. 2 The results are shown in Table 6. TABLE 6EMI32.1 tb SEP .
