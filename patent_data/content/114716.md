# Acoustic optic beam deflector.

## Abstract
An acousto optic beam deflector comprises an optically active stress optic medium 10 , such as crystalline quartz, driven by a longitudinal acoustic wave transducer 12 . The deflector is independent of optical polarization, and therefore both polarization components of an input optical beam, such as a laser beam, are scattered with equal efficiencies.
