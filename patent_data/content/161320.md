# COLOR CATHODE RAY TUBE.

## Abstract
A multi purpose color cathode ray tube employs as the red fluorescent material for its color fluorescent screen a rare earth fluorescent material which is mixed with ZnCd S Ag or ZnCd S Cu as a short afterglow fluorescent material 5 to 30 by weight with respect to the total amount of the red fluorescent material, thus making it pos sible to obtain, in regard to the emission of red light, high luminance similar to that in an ordinary color picture tube, and causing a steep reduction in luminance in the early stage of emission of light, whereby it is possible for address detection to be accurately effected by, for example, a light pen pickup.
