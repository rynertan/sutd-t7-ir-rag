# Floppy disc drive assembly.

## Abstract
A floppy disc drive assembly with direct disc rotational drive, comprises a a step motor having a plurality of pole pairs with coils 55 and pole pieces 53 , the latter being fabricated at predetermined locations from the base 50 of the drive housing and b a disc armature 62 having radial webs 64 and rotatably mounted in bearing 60, 61 on base 50 so that pairs of radial webs 64 align one pair at a time with successive ones of successively energized pole pairs 53, 55 . In this manner an efficient and compact assembly is formed. Means are provided which enable clutch to engage a floppy disc with a disc drive ring 68 only when the floppy disc is properly seated within the assembly.
