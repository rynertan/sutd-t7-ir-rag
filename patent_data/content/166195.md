# Printer having control system for metal band holding print elements.

## Abstract
A printer of the type including a platen 1 , a bank of hammers 2 extending in a straight line along the platen and spaced from the platen, a continuous metal band 5 on which are mounted print elements 33 and drive means 6, 18 for moving the band 5 between the platen 1 and the hammer bank 2 is provided with means 19, 20, 50, 61 for controlling the movement of the band. This band movement control means includes a guide surface 50 extending along the hammer bank 2 and bearing means 19, 20 located adjacent to one edge of the guide surface 50 and including at least ont bearing surface extending perpendicular to the guide surface. The control means also includes a per manent magnet means 61 located adjacent to the guide surface 50 ant the bearing means 19, 20 and adapted to attract one surface of the band 5 to the guide surface 50 and one edge of the band to the bearing surface. The permanent magnet means comprises a plurality of elongated parallel sided permanent magnet members 62 each magnetised so as to exhibit a pole of one polarity on one elongate surface and a pole of the opposite polarity on the opposite elongate surface. The elongated permanent magnet members 62 are positioned side by side in parallel lines so that the exposed elongate surfaces of adjacent members exhibit poles of opposite polarity. The elongated permanent members 62 are located on the guide surface 50 so that the parallel lines are inclined at an angle to the direction of movement of the band 5 past the guide surface 50 , towards the bearing surface.
