# Sun visor, particularly for motorvehicles.

## Abstract
The sun visor 10 comprises a rectilinear cell extruded load bearing structure supported on a rod 130 pivotally inserted in the rectilinear cells in frictional engagement therewith, the load bearing structure carrying an elastically yielding metal lamina 15 caused to adhere in forced contact engagement to a corresponding portion 131 of the support ing rod 130 in such a way as to provide at least one auxiliary friction component for the frictional engagement between the sun visor bearing structure and the supporting rod.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A sun visor particularly for motorvehicles, comprising a load bearing structure 11 extruded with rectilinear cells, and suspension and attachement means including a rod 130 pivotally inserted into one of said cells in frictional engagement therewith, characterized in that said load bearing structure 11 carries at least one elastically yielding metal lamina 15 which is caused to adhere in forced contact engagement to a corresponding portion of said rod 130 , to thus provide at least one auxiliary friction component for the frictional engagement, said rod portion being external to the cell containing said rod 130 . 2. A sun visor according to Claim 1, wherein said lamina 15 has a V like configuration and is set astride the corresponding rod 130 portion 131 in engagement therewith. 3. A sun visor according to Claim 1 and 2, wherein said rod portion 131 is of prismatic shape, thereby said lamina and said rod portion 131 cooperate in defining a series of stable angular setting positions for the sun visor.

## Description
This invention relates to a sun visor, partimalarly for motorvehicles. Pub hed Italian Application No. 69287 A 78 by the same Applicant discloses a sun visor characterized in that it comprises a load bearing structure made up of a shaped element formed by die cutting from a sheet of a cellular polymeric material which is extruded continuously the cells therein being rectilinear parallel, and trough like. In accordance with the foregoing patent application, also provided are attaching means comprising at least one rod formed from a round metal bar, which is inserted, over a straight portion of suitable length, into one of the trough like cells such as to create a hinge system useful both for suspending the visor and attaching it in frictional engagement said engagement being achieved by simple friction contact between the rod and inside surface of the cellular trough, This invention is directed to providing an improved constructional modifications, whereby said loadbearing structure of the sun visor includes at least one elastically yielding metal lamina, advantageously of steel, which is caused to adhere in forced contact engagement with a corresponding portion of the rod, to provide at least one auxiliary friction component for the frictional engagement, said rod portion being external to the cell containing said rod. According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, that portion of the rod which is engaged by the foil is of prismatic shape, thereby said lamina and said portion cooperate in defining a series of stable angular setting positions for the sun visor. The invention will be more clearly understood from the detailed description which follows, with reference to the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is a partly sectional elevation view of the sun visor according to this invention and Figure 2 is a perspective view showing a detail of Figure 1. As described in the foregoing patent application, the sun visor 10 according to this invention coxprises an internal load bearing structure 11 formed from a polymeric material and covered with a sheathing 12 which envelopes and encloses said structure, and suspension and hinge connection means generally indicated at 13. The structure 11 includes a shaped element matching the peripheral contour of the visor and being formed by die cutting from an extruded cellular sheet characterized by the presence of parallel continuous cells a bordered by parallel ribs n included between two sheets f1 2 f2facing each other.The suspension means 13 comprises a cylindrical metal rod 130 which is simply force fitted into one of said cells such as to create a hinge connection with frictional engagement, thereby the visor can be tilted about the common axis of the cell and rod inserted therein. One end of the rod 130 protrudes from the visor, and engages a corresponding seat of a positioning hinge 20 where the visor suspension is of the side swinging type. According to the invention, in the load bearing element 11, there is formed a cutout 14 of saddlelike configuration, which leaves uncovered a corresponding portion 131 of the rod 130. On said rod portion, there acts at least one elastically yield ing metal lamina 15 advantageously formed from spring steel which has one end rigidly connected to the structure 11 as by rivets 16. The other portion of the lamina is caused to adhere in forced contact relationship against the portion 131 of the rod, thus providing at least one auxiliary friction component for the frictional engagement between the rod and cell. Advantageously, the lamina 15 has a v e configuration and is set astride the portion 131 of the rod as clearly shove in Figure 2. Purthermore, the portion 131 has preferably a prismatic shape, thereby the lamina and rod portion can cooperate in defining a series a stable angular setting positions for the sun visor. Of course, all the effects of the present application will also apply to any other embodiments of the same basic inventive concept.
