# Method and device of maintaining tension on a tape and application to a typewriter.

## Abstract
A tensioning device is disclosed in which a capstan 10 is adapted for receiving a spool of tape or ribbon, for example of the erase type, on its central portion 4, 13 . A toothed gear wheel 16 is connected to the capstan 10 . A slider 1 is provided with at least one tooth 15 which is adapted to be engaged with the gear wheel 16 . The slider 1 is biased in one direction in a recess 8 by means of a spring 2 and is arranged to slide within the recess 8 , in the opposite direction only, to an extent which is sufficient to allow the tooth or teeth 15 and the toothed gear wheel 16 to slip relative to each other. This permits the capstan 10 to make a rotation in a stepwise manner, the length of the steps being dependent on the number of teeth on the slider 1 and the pitch or spacing thereof.
