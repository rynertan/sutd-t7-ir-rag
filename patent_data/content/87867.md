# Cup type pipeline inflation anchor.

## Abstract
A cup type pipeline inflation anchor for sealing a conduit bore comprises a tubular elastomeric bladder 30 attached to a shoe assembly 14 , with a flexible anchor, e.g. two layers 34,36 of calendered steel cable being fixed to the shoe assembly and surrounding the bladder. At the free end of the bladder, a cup 48 is bonded thereto and overlaps the layers of cable. In operation, a valve 60 beween the interior and exterior of the anchor is closed and fluid pressure increased in the conduit 12 . The initial seal is made by the trailing cup edge expanding to firmly contact the conduit wall, after which the remainder of the cup expands into contact with the wall, and the tubular bladder subsequently expands as pressure is further increased, pressing the cable into frictional engagement with the conduit wall.
