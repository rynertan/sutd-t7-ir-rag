# STRAP ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A strap assembly for connecting a strap 3 to a housing 41 , e.g. for a wristwatch radio, wherein the housing has a body 47 and a back 45 and wherein a hinge 61 connected to the strap 3 is connected to the housing 41 by providing an open ended recess or slot 57 which receives the end portions of the hinge 61 . Preferably, the slots 47 are provided just in the body 47 and are of a depth greater than the diameter of the hinge 61 and depending projections 87 on the back 45 hold the hinge 61 in position when the back is assembled with the body. A further most important feature of the invention is the provision of a special construction of hinge pin 61 which allows an electrical conductor 4 in the strap 3 to be led into the housing 41 through the neutral axis of the hinge pin 61 so that there is minimal flexing of the conductor 4 when the strap 3 is pivoted relative to the housing 41 . For this purpose the hinge pin 61 is provided with a first offset portion 69 and further offset end portions 59 , the actual hinge portions which connect the pin to the strap 3 being shown at 63.
