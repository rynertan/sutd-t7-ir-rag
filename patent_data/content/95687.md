# Maximum demand meter.

## Abstract
A maximum demand meter comprises a driving part for transmitting a rotation depending on a consumed electric energy, a differential gear mechanism 36 comprising a first sun gear 38 rotated by the driving part in a predeter mined direction, a second sun gear 41 driven in the op posite direction of the rotation of the first sun gear and a planet gear 39 for transmitting the rotations of the first and second sun gears to a push arm 50 for moving a pointer 19 , a zero returning driving means 44 47 for rotating the second sun gear 41 of said differential gear mechanism in a predetermined direction and an engaging pawl means 52, 53 for inhibiting either of the first and second sun gears of the differential gear mechanism from rotating in a predeter mined direction. In normal state, the engaging paw means 52, 53 inhibits the second sun gear 41 from rotation and allows the rotation of the first sun gear 38 to rotate the planet gear 39 thereby to forwardly move the push arm 50 and at a demand time, the engaging pawl means inhibits the first sun gear from the rotation and allows the second sun gear 41 to rotate and the zero returning driving means 44 47 drives the second sun gear 41 to rotate the planet gear 39 thereby to return the push arm 50 to the zero position.
