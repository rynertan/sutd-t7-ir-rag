# Connector assembly for sterile connection of two internally sterile containers or tubings.

## Abstract
A connector assembly for sterile connection of two internally sterile containers or tubings comprises two con nectors 3, 4 . The first connector 3 has a male part 5 inside a housing 6 , a connecting device to connect the first connector to a first container or tubing 1 , a first deformable barrier 7 spaced from the male part 5 and a chamber 8 between the male part 5 and the first barrier 7 . The second connector 4 comprises a female part 9 , a connecting device to connect the second connector to a second contain er or tubing 2 and a second deformable barrier 11 closing the female part 9 . In connecting the connectors 3, 4 first both deformable barriers 7, 11 are brought into contact with each other after which the male part 5 of the first connector 3 is put through the second barrier 11 closing the female part 9 of the second connector 4 . To guarantee that during each coupling and disconnecting procedure the absolute sterility of the interior of the female part is maintained the second barrier 11 is mounted in the entrance part of the female part 9 and is pushed entirely through the first barrier 7 during the connection of the connectors 3, 4 into the chamber 8 between the male part 5 and the first barrier 7 before the male part 5 can penetrate the second barrier 11 . Further at least the second barrier 11 consists of a resilient material which during the disconnecting procedure of the connectors will be restored in the chamber 8 into the original closing position.
