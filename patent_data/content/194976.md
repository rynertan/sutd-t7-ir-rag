## Description
The present invention concerns a device for the rapid connection of two elements on nonparallel planes, or of two mutually orthogonal or sloping walls.Most devices for the rapid connection, which are presently used, provide solutions of mutual fastening of elements on parallel planes by means of rubber nogs put into proper holes.The known devices are generally not fit to guarantee a rapid connection of two elements when, instead of being positioned on parallel planes, they are on orthogonal or sloping walls or on nonparallel planes.The purpose of the present invention is to provide a device for the rapid connection of two elements on nonparallel planes, characterized in that it consists of a body having the two supporting sides against the walls to be fastened forming the fastening angle, the first of said sides having a hole fully or partially piercing the body of the device, fit to be engaged by means fastening the first wall, the second one having an appendix expandable under the action of said fastening means, which is to be fastened into an aperture made in the second wall.Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will emerge from the description which follows with reference to the appended drawings, provided purely by way of non limiting example in which Fig. 1 shows a plan view, a perspective view and a side view of the device according to the present invention with a square appendix to be fastened on orthogonal walls Fig. 2 shows a plan view, a perspective view and a side view of the device according to the present invention with a circular appendix to be fastened on orthogonal walls Fig. 3 shows a plan view, a perspective view and a side view of the device according to the present invention to be fastened on sloping walls.With reference to Figg. 1, 2 and 3, numeral 2 shows the device consisting of a body having a hole 3 fully or partially piercing it, fit to receive the fastening element 4 through the hole 8 of the wall of the element 6, and of an appendix 5.Appendix 5 has a mushroom shape and proper notches, at least one of which is so deep to reach the hole 3 the resulting projections 9 are consequently fit to engage into the aperture 7 made in the wall 1, which may be either rectangular or square Fig. 1 .In this case the appendix 5 of the element 2, with the projections 9, will have the same rectangular or square shape to allow the fastening of the element 1 with respect to the element 6 in only one spatial position.In another preferred embodiment Fig. 2 the aperture 7 made in the wall 1 is circular. In this case the appendix 5 of the element 2, with the projections 9, will have the same circular shape to allow a spatially free fastening of the element 1 with respect to the element 6.Fig. 3 shows a third embodiment of the device 2 when the walls 1 and 6 are not on orthogonal planes. For the rapid connection of the two elements the technician will act as follows insert the device 2 into the aperture 7 previously made in the wall 1 insert the screw 4 into the hole 8 previously made in the w√†ll 6 fasten the screw 4 into the hole 3 of the device by this operation the appendix 5 and the related projections 9 will be widened and the two elements l and 6 will be mutually fastened.When the device illustrated in Fig. 2 is used, before the complete fastening, the technician can rotate the bpdy 2 fastening the element 6 with respect to the element 1 in the desired position.Naturally the construction details and the embodiments may be varied widely with respect to what described and illustrated without thereby departing from the scope of the present invention.
