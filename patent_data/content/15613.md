# Method for making laminated boards.

## Abstract
The board is made up of a layer of thermal and or acoustic insulant and of a layer of fibre reinforced water hardened cement, whereby the layer of insulant is bonded to the layer of fibre reinforced water hardened cement by means of an aqueous plastic dispersion containing an ad dition polymer of an average particle size which is between 0.05 and 5 Âµ. In the hardening mass in the layer of fibre reinforced water hardened cement a water cement ratio is applied which is between 0.2 and 0.5. The plastic dispersion pre ferably is incorporated in at least that part of the cement layer which is in contact with the insulating layer or in the whole layer of fibre reinforced water hardened cement. The weight ratio of resin to cement is between 0.02 and 0.4 and as fibre reinforcing glas or polymer fibres may be applied.
