# Process and biological contact gas scrubber for waste gas purification.

## Abstract
Process and apparatus is disclosed for removing pollu tants from a waste gas stream comprising culturing in a rotary biocontactor a biomass capable of assimilating the pollutants and producing harmless metabolites. The waste gas stream is brought into contact with the biomass within the biocontactor. The biocontactor includes a plurality of discs mounted for rotation within the biocontactor. The waste gas stream in passing over the exposed biomass on the disc results in the pollutants being absorbed by the biomass. In turn the biomass assimilates the pollutants and produces harmless metabolites. The gas stream with a substantial percentage of pollutants removed therefrom and containing any gaseous metabolites is exhausted from the biocontactor.
