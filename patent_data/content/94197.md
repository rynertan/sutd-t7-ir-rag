# Hydro mechanical actuator.

## Abstract
A hydro mechanical actuator 1 for adjustably positioning a part, for example a roll carriage 4 of a vertical roll mill stand, comprises an actuating member 10 having a pusher 13, which is mechanically driven to approximate a desired position and then is adjustably displaced by a hydraulic mechanism. The actuator member has a threaded portion 12 which engages a nut 18 secured against rotation by keys 22 hence rotation of the actuating member 10 will cause its axial displacement. Rotation of actuating member 10 is by a splined sleeve 14 which engages a splined portion 11 of the actuating member 10. The hydraulic mechanism includes a piston 20 which engages with the nut 18 which can move axially with the actuating member 10, so that the position of the actuating member 10, and pusher 13, can be adjusted by controllably varying the pressure applied to either side of the piston 20 in cylinder 21.
