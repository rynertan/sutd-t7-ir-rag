# Method of preliminary desiliconization of molten iron by injecting gaseous oxygen.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a method for prelimi nary treatment of molten iron from a blast furnace wherein only desiliconization of the iron is effected. Gaseous oxygen is injected into the molten iron by controlling its supply rate depending on the Si content of the molten iron in such a manner that said rate is increased if the Si content of the iron is high and decreased if the Si content is low.
