## Description
Device for discharging brush bodies one by one from a storage.The present invention covers a device for discharging brush bodies one by one from a storage bin or the like, operation of this device being independent from the shape and position of the brush bodies within the storage and this device being moreover very simple in construction, as well as most efficient and reliable.This device is more specifically meant to pick brush bodies one by one from a storage, taking them to an installation for further treatment, more particularly in the first instance to a so called detection or positioning device.In certain cases, e.g. when the brush bodies show a particular profile, it is possible however to discharge these brush bodies one by one with the device according to the invantion, so that they are already positioned with the side in which the holes for inserting the brush fibers must be or are provided, turned upwards.In a particular application the device according to the invention will be used for oblong brush bodies, such as toothbrush bodies.This device mainly consists of a storage bin, the lower part of which comprises at least two alternating slides lifting and discharging the brush bodies from the storage, featuring that the top surfaces of these slides are slanted downwards in the direction of the outlet opening and placed at such levels that they are located higher towards the spot where the brush bodies leave the storage.For the purpose of pointing out more clearly the features of the invention, some preferential embodiments are described below, as examples without any limiting nature, referring to the attached drawings in which figure 1 schematically shows a device according to the invention figures 2 and 3 are views, similar to that of figure 1 but for other characteristic positions figure 4 shows an embodiment of the device according to the invention comprising four slides figure 5 shows a view similar to that of figure 4, but the slides having a slanted position figure 6 shows a view similar to that of figure 4 but the slides having different thicknesses figures 7 through 9 show further alternative embodiments of figure 1 figures 10 and 11 show two examples of modifications to the embodiment according to figure 8.The device as shown in figure 1 mainly consists of a storage bin 1 of which, in this case, wall 2 is sloping, thelower part of this storage bin being provided with means to lift brush bodies 3 from the lower part of the storage, step by step upwards to enable final outfeed of brush bodies 3 through an opening 4 in a wall 5 to a unit of further treatment, e.g. a detection and or positioning device. The said means which, according to the present. invention, raise the brush bodies step by step, mainly consist of two adjacent parralel slides 6 7 which can be moved alternatively with respect to the brush bodies contained in storage bin 1, a wall, respectively 8 and 9, being provided behind each slide when viewed in the direction of brush body travel, on which the brush bodies can be subsequently placed to take them to the next, respectively higher slide, to be ultimately discharged through opening 4.The said slides, as well as the walls installed behind them, all have a width approximately equal to the width of a brush body, the level of the slide top surfaces, respectively 10 and 11, increasing gradually from the lowest part of storage bin 1 with respect to a common horizontal line.Moreover, as appears clearly from figures 1 through 3, both the top surfaces of slides 6 7 and those of walls 8 and 9, respectively 12 13, are slanted, all in such a manner that the brush bodies lifted by such slides, will slip by gravity towards a wall located behind, whereas during the downward movement of the slides these brush bodies, also by the effect of gravity, will slip off the top surfaces of walls 8 and 9 either to be taken to the next slide or to be discharged through opening 4.By slanting the top edges of the said slides on one hand, as well as those of the walls installed behind them on the other hand, falling back of brush bodies from a slide located higher is widely avoided on one hand and on the other hand, transfer of brush bodies from a slide to the wall behind it and from such a wall to the next slide becomes very simple and most efficient.Furthermore it appears clearly from figures 1 through 3 that due to the alternating movement of slides 6 and 7, brush bodies 3 will be discharged one by one with greatest certainty through the said opening 4, which can also be formed through the top edge of storage bin 1.The said slides 6 and 7 can be driven separately or commonly the slides being dimensioned ofequal length or not of equal thickness or not being installed vertically or under a determined angle, etc.All this will be detailed further below in figures 4 through 11.Figure 4 shows an embodiment comprising 4 slides, respectively 6 7, 14 and 15, behind which are provided walls, respectively 8 9 16 and 17, all in accordance with the embodiment shown in figure 1, the said slides having different lengths and being driven by a common cam 18.Figure 5 shows an ambodiment in which slides 6 7 14 15 and the walls 8 9 16 17 installed behind them are slanted in such a manner that identically the same effect as with the slides according to figure 4 is obtained.It is obvious that the number of slides can be increased in accordance with the requirements.However, the reliability of the brush bodies being discharged one by one from storage bin 1 per alternating movement also depends on the shape and size of such brush bodies, so that in certain cases the device according to the invention will have to be adapted to said shape and size.As an example, figure 6 shows an embodiment in which slides 6 7 14 and 15 have been made gradually narrower, all in such a manner that the width of the last slide 15 is approximately equal to the largest width of a brush body, whereas the preceding slides are wider, in order that the wider slides will displace with greater certainty one or several brush bodies to the next slide. By way of example it is shown in figure 6 that the said slides may also be equal in length.Figure 7 shows an embodiment in which two sets of slides are provided, each set comprising in this case three slides, respectiviely 6 7 14, 19 20 21, which can be adequately moved with respect to one another and with respect to the walls located behind them, respectively 22 23 24 25 26 and 27.Of course in such an embodiment comprising two sets of slides it is also possible to omit the said partitions 22 through 26.Figure 8 shows an embodiment in which the certainty that by each up and down movement of the slides a brush body is discharged, is obtained by lining up two devices as provided in figure 4, thereby also, and especially, increasing the self contained operating period of the machine.It is obvious that, if desired or necessary, such an embodiment can still be extended by lining up more than two similar devices, whereas, dependent upon shape and size of the brush bodies to be handled, one or several of these devices can be switched off, on one hand, whereas also the feed rate of one compartment can be changed with respect to the other by stopping operation of one compartment with respect to the other for a determined period of time or by acting on the driving speed of the slides in the various compartments. Figure 9 shows still another embodiment in which the storage bin comprises a device as shown in figure 1, preceded by a single wide slide 28, ensuring that per stroke a relatively large amount of brush bodies is transferred from the first storage bin, to the second storage bin, in which the aforementioned slides 6 7 14 and 15 are operating.Furthermore it is shown in figures 10 and 11 that the storage bin more specifically the storage bin bottom 29, can be hinged in order to simplify in certain cases the feed towards slide 28 and by causing the bottom 29 to pivot upwards to facilitate displacement of the brush bodies towards slide 28, on one hand, while figure 11 shows an embodiment in which wall 29 is stationary and storage bin 1 is equipped with a pusher element 30 which can be actuated by an adequate pressure cylinder 31 for displacing the brush bodies towards slide 28.Moreover, from the examples according to figures 9 through 11 it appears that, especially with these embodiments, brush bodies from a very large stock can be handled so that the machine becomes very self contained As already mentioned before, it may be desirable in certain cases, e.g. when the brush bodies have a profile suiting such procedure, to shape the top surface of at least the last slide discharging the brush bodies from the storage bin, so that the top surface of this slide has an adequate profile to compel the brush body to assume such a position on this slide that the side in which the holes will be provided or are provided already, is always turned upwards. This will provide a very simple device, enabling to discharge one by one the brush bodies from an available stock, whereas these brush bodies may or may not have a particular profile and at least the last slide before the brush body is expelled from the storage bin may be shaped so as to give a determined position to the brush body.Of course this device, as well as its parts, may be carried out in any shape or size, also depending upon the shape and outline of the brush bodies to be handled.
