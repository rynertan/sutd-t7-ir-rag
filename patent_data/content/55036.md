# MULTI LAYER PACKAGING MATERIAL AND PROCESS FOR MAKING IT

## Abstract
The packaging material comprises five layers bonded face to face, the layers in sequence being a biaxially oriented rupture resistant layer 18 , an adhesive layer 16 , an alumini um foil 14 , a polyolefine layer 12 modified by a fused ring or ganic acid anhydride and a polyolefine heat sealable layer 10 . Production of the packaging material first involves coextruding a deuplex film comprising layers 10 and 12 . This film is then bonded to one side of the aluminium foil 14 in a roll nip under heat and pressure, the foil being brought into contact with the anhydride modified layer 12 . Finally, the foil embodying lami nate is completed by bonding the biaxially oriented layer 18 to the exposed other surface of the foil 14 using an adhesive layer for instance comprising a polyester urethane.
