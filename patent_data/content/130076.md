# Riveting machines.

## Abstract
A riveting apparatus comprises a portable riveting assembly 1 which may be hand held or mounted on a robot arm. The assembly 1 comprises a C frame 2 having an anvil 5 mounted on one arm and a hydraulic ram 6 mounted on the other arm. Rivets are supplied to a head assembly 8 located between the anvil 5 and piston rod 7 via a flexible tube 10 having a T shaped cross section. After a rivet has been supplied it is held positively in position ready for setting within pocket members 22 by air pressure supplied along tube 10 . Thus, the assembly can be moved rapidly and used in various orientations without displacing the rivet. Connec tions between the assembly 1 and rivet supply and hydraulic power source are by way of flexible connections.
