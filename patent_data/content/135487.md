# Exhaust device.

## Abstract
An exhaust device comprising an elongate hood having side walls 3, 4 . An internal, centrally located deflection casing 10 has two mutually aligned suction openings 8, 9 which, in combination with an air supply device 6 disposed at the bottom of the hood, causes the generation of two axially aligned rotational flow patterns P2, P 2 in the hood between each side wall 4, 3 and the central deflection casing 10 , from which polluted air is exhausted via 11, 12 .
