## Description
CONTINUOUS PROCESS FOR PRODUCING LINEAR. SECONDARY. ALIPHATIC ALCOHOLS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical Field This invention relates to the continuous production of linear0 secondary aliphatic alcohols.with co production of carboxylic acid esters. from selected olefins. alcohols and carboxylic acids.This is achieved by two reactions in sequence 1 the reaction between o olefins and carboxylic acids. and 2 a transesterification reaction.DescriPtion of the Prior Art The oxylation of olefins by carboxylic acids has long been known in general terms however, catalysis has been problematical and full commercial success has been elusive. More specifically, homogeneous. strong acid catalysis of the olefin carboxylic acid reaction is well known seeUS Patents 2.414.999 and 2,415.000 , but suffers from problems of poor efficiency and troublesome product isolation attributable to extensive by product formation through olefin dimerization and oligomerization reactions cf. Rohm Haas Co.Technical Bulletin entitled Amberlyst 15, FluidProcess Chemicals Group, September. 1978 .Furthermore. since the equilibrium constant for the olefin carboxylic acid addition reaction decreases rapidly with increasing chain length of the olefin cf. US Patent 3.037,052 . this reaction has generally been considered impractical for olefins in the detergent range of C11 C16. Attempts have been made to overcome the problems inherent with homogeneous catalysis by using heterogeneous catalysts of the strong acid type, such as sulfonated styrene divinyl benzene copolymers.However, the gel type ion exchange resins were ineffective catalysts for the reaction. whereas the macroreticular type resins were effective catalysts for the reaction with a olefins, but not for the reaction with the internal olefin species which are formed during the reaction by isomerization. One object of the present invention.therefore. is to provide for the efficient catalysis of the reaction between certain a olefins, and their internal isomers. and certain carboxylic acids. Transesterification and reactive distillation are each individually known in a variety of processes. Transesterification is virtually always practiced as a batch reaction with rather large quantities of one reactant being used to drive the reaction toward completion by mass action displacement of the equilibrium. Another commonly used approach is that of equilibrium displacement by removal of product or coproduct as it is formed in the system frequently this can be accomplished via an azeotropic distillation. Continuous transesterification has been practiced. but in only few instances and then only under circumstances decidedly favorable to the reaction. For example. one system has been described for continuously ester exchanging 1,4 butanediol diaacetate with ethanol to coproduce 1,4, butanediol and methyl acetate cf. German patent application 2.820.521 or British patent application 2.031,421 A second system cf. US 4,260,813 has been described for continuously producing ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate from ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and ethyl acetate.In both of these systems, conditions for exchange are favorable because the esters being exchanged are derived from reactive primary hydroxyl groups. A particularly significant attribute of the prior art systems, however. is that they need not react to substantial completion because the higher molecular weight alcohol and ester couples used as reactants can be separated by conventional distillation. Such separation is not possible in the systems of the present invention because the acetate esters of typical detergent range alcohols.such as the tridecyl and tetradecyl alcohols. boil at the same temperature as the corresponding alcohols. and the downstream conversion of the product secondary alcohols. into high performance surfactant range alcohols requires substantially pure alcohol reactants. Thus. another object of the present invention is to provide for the efficient transesterification of the reaction products of olefins and carboxylic acids to produce desired alcohols andby product carboxylic acid esters. Both reactions employed in this process are chemically reversible i.e.. under usual conditions they reach equilibrium at a point short of complete conversion. Generally speaking. such reactions are not well suited to multi step. continuous process operation that two such reactions are employed in the continuous process of this invention is, therefore, unique in itself. Moreover, both reactions exhibit certain other characteristics which under the usual circumstances would render them unattractive candidates around which to develop a continuous process.For example. the carboxylic acid a olefin reaction of step 1 . above. is generally considered to present problems of 1 decreasing equilibrium constant with increasing size of olefin. 2 by product formation efficiency loss through olef in oligomerization polymerization, and 3 poor structural selectivity in the product multiplicity of positional isomers. all secondary are formed because of olefin isomerizations which accompany the desired acid olefin addition reaction. Accordingly, this reaction would not generally be considered an attractive choice for inclusion in a continuous process route to long chain alcohols.Similarly. the transesterification reaction of step 2 , above. is generally considered to be useful only in cases where 1 incomplete conversions are acceptable. 2 large excesses of one reactant may be used to drive the reaction in the desired direction, or 3 the equilibrium position can be displaced by continual removal of either product or coproduct. Thus transesterification. although generally a clean.efficient reaction. is typically practiced only as a batch operation. Accordingly. an additional object of the present invention is the development of an economically superior, highly efficient.environmentally clean. continuous process utilizing the reaction sequence described above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that these and other worthwhile objects can be met by a continuous process for co producing higher secondary alcohols and lower carboxylic acid esters from long chain olefins and lower carboxylic acids, comprising the steps of A passing a long chain olefin or mixture. optionally in a mixture with the internal olefin isomers thereof together with a lower carboxylic acid through a reaction zone in the presence of an acidic heterogeneous catalyst under conditions at which the corresponding oxylation reaction will occur and thereby producing secondary alcohol carboxylates and isomers thereof B recovering the carboxylates and isomers thereof produced in step A B optionally, the additional step of mixing the recovered carboxylates and isomers thereof with a lower aliphatic alcohol in a pre reaction zone in the presence of an ester exchange catalyst under conditions at which pre reaction will occur C passing the recovered carboxylates and isomers thereof together with a lower aliphatic alcohol through a reactive distillation still in the presence of an ester exchange catalyst under conditions at which the ester exchange will occur and thereby producing, as co products, secondary alcohols of said long chain olefins and carboxylates of said lower aliphatic alcohol and D removing said secondary alcohols predominantly in the tails stream and said carboxylates predominantly in the overhead stream. The process of this invention is uniquely suited to the production of linear. secondary alcohols of the type which are used commercially as hydrophobes in the preparation of high performance. speciality. nonionic surfactants. Alcohols of this type are expensive to manufacture at the present time they are available only through controlled paraffin oxidation processes which exhibit rather poor selectivity and chemical efficiency. The present process represents a decidedly superior route to detergent range, secondary alcohols. The products obtained from this process have all the structural characteristics desirable for speciality surfactant hydrophobe service.namely, a distribution of carbon numbers within the general range of C12 C15 linear chains with all secondary hydroxyl functionality, and a broad isomer distribution. In addition. these products are free of troublesome e.g.. color forming impurities.such as carbonyl compounds which are generally present in alcohols derived from oxidation processes. The properties and performance characteristics of surfactants derived from hydrophobes made via this process match or surpass those of counterparts made from paraffin oxidation derived hydrophobes. The overall utility of the present process is enormously enhanced by the simultaneous production. in the ester exchange step. of commercially valuable coproducts in a high state of purity. Inasmuch as there is considerable latitude available in terms of coproduct selection. the manufacturer can operate his facility in whatever coproduct mode best fits his coproduct business needs at a given point in time. Thus. the process is truly unique in terms of flexibility. efficiency.and environmental cleanliness. In turn, these factors all contribute to the economic superiority exhibited by this process over alternate routes to detergent range. secondary alcohols. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention concerns a novel process for coproducing two commercially valuable classes of organic compounds. namely. 1 linear. secondary.aliphatic alcohols in the C1O Cl6 carbon number range. and 2 lower C1 C6 carboxylic acid esters of lower C1 C8 , linear. branched, or cyclic aliphatic alcohols. The C10 C16 2 alcohols provided by this process are widely used as intermediates hydrophobes in the manufacture of speciality, high performance, non ionic and anionic surface active agents. The coproduct carboxylic acid esters of the lower aliphatic alcohols are used commercially as solvents. monomers. chemical intermediates, fragrances. etc. The process of the present invention is unique in that not only does it afford valuable products and coproducts. but also in that it is environmentally cleaner than. and economically superior to, existing processes.Additionally, this process is highly flexible in terms of the coproduct moiety while simultaneously being structurally selective in terms of the product moiety. The following equations illustrate the sequence of reactions comprising the process and the types of products and coproducts which result from its practice EMI8.1 tb 1 tb R1 CH CH SEP SEP R4 SEP CO SEP H SEP H SEP Resin SEP R1 CH CH tb SEP 2 SEP 2 SEP SEP l SEP 43 tb SEP OCOR tb la tb R2 CH CH R3 SEP SEP R4 SEP CO SEP H SEP H SEP Resin SEP R2 CH CH R3 tb SEP OCOR4 tb SEP and SEP OCOR tb SEP 2 SEP 3 tb SEP R2 SEP CH2CH R3 tb SEP 14 tb SEP OCOR4 tb 2 tb R1 CH CH3 SEP SEP R5 SEP OH SEP Ti SEP alcoholate SEP R1 CH CH SEP SEP R4COOR5 tb SEP 1 SEP 3 tb SEP OCOR4 SEP OH tb wherein R1 is a C8 C14 radical. preferably a C1O Cl2 radical R2 and R3 are linear.unsubstituted radicals whose chain lengths satisfy the relationship R2 R3 9 C8 C14 R4 is a C1 C5 radical. preferably a C1 C2 radical and R is a C1 C8 radical. preferably a C2 C radical. either linear. branched. or cyclic. Thus. if R X a C12H25, R4 CH3 and R I. n C4H9. the example shows the formation of sec. tetradecanol mixture of several isomers as the product and n butyl acetate as the coproduct.The titanium alcoholate can be any of those catalytically active species known to the art however. it is preferred that the alcoholate be that corresponding to the reactant alcohol. i.e., R5 OH. Through the wide latitude possible in choice of R and R5. the process exhibits exceptional flexibility in terms of the coproduct ester. At the same time, the process exhibits structural selectivity in terms of the product alcohol because it leads exclusively to secondary isomers of linear structure. In the continuous process of this invention. olefin and carboxylic acid are brought together in a reaction zone at the head end of the process train while 2 alcohol and coproduct ester are simultaneously recovered from appropriate distillation columns at the tail end of the process train. A particularly advantageous feature of the process of this invention is its simplicity. For example. the only operations other than the reactions themselves which are required between the head and tail ends of the process train are several continuous distillations which serve to remove separate unreacted raw materials for recycle. The process of this invention is generally described as follows. using for purposes of illustration the case wherein a mixture of C13 Cl4 a olefins, acetic acid and n butanol are the raw materials. a mixture of secondary C13 Cl4 alcohols mixed isomers is the product.and n butyl acetate is the coproduct. It is optional, but desirable. to insert prior to the oxylation step a pre reaction clean up reactor to remove tramp metal ions. This may desirably be a bed packed with the oxyalkylation catalyst. e.g., Amberlyst 15, but operated at a relatively low temperature, e.g., 600C. This temperature is chosen to be below the reaction temperature of the oxyalkylation reaction thus. the catalyst acts essentially as an ion exchange resin instead of an oxylation catalyst. A preheated mixture of acetic acid in excess. preferably and C13 C14 a olefins is passed first through an ion exchange resin bed and then through one or more heated. fixed bed type reaction zones containing strongly acidic resin s as catalyst s . Temperature and pressure in the oxylation step are not considered narrowly critical, but should be chosen to maintain all reactants in the liquid phase. Conversion rate will increase with increasing temperature. but catalyst deterioration will also thereby be accelerated. The homogeneous effluent from the reaction zone s contains unreacted acetic acid, unreacted C13 C14 olefins in partially isomerized form , and multiple isomers all secondary of the acetates of tridecyl and tetradecyl alcohols. A typical range for olefin conversion is 20 35 the actual conversion achieved is dependent upon a host of variables including temperature, residence time in the reactor. acid olefin mol ratio. catalyst.catalyst age, extent of isomerization in the recycle olefin feed, etc., but must necessarily be 100 because of the reversible nature of the reaction. The homogeneous effluent from the reactor s is pumped directly into the column section of a stripping still operated at or below atmospheric pressure wherein acetic acid is flashed overhead and recycled to the reaction system while a substantially acid free effluent is removed from the base of the still. This stream is pumped into the mid or upper column section of a vacuum stripping still wherein partially isomerized C13 Cl4 olefins are recovered overhead for recycle to the reaction system while a substantially olefin free effluent is removed from the base of the still.When this stripping still is operating in a steady state mode at the appropriate conditions of temperature. pressure. feed rate and reflux ratio.both the overhead and the bottoms stream will contain 2 contaminants. The effluent from the base of the olefins acetates separation still is mixed in line with pre dried n butanol and a typical ester exchange catalyst. such as tetrabutyl titanate. in the desired proportions and the resulting mix is allowed to undergo pre reaction in a vessel of the continuous stirred tank reactor CSTR type. The effluent from this pre reactor is then pumped to the upper column section of a reactive distillation still while additional n butanol is vaporized into the base of the still column. Transesterification occurs in the column. each tray acting as a reaction stage.The still is operated on a total make basis i.e., no reflux , butanol and coproduct butyl acetate being removed overhead continuously these two species form an azeotrope while an effluent stream consisting predominantly of C13 C14 secondary alcohols and C13 Cl4 titanate is removed continuously from the reboiler at the base of the still. Other components minor of the still base stream include butanol. butyl acetate and unreacted tridecyl tetradecyl acetate. When this still is operating in a steady state mode at the desired conditions of temperature, reactants mol ratio. and residence time, conversion of acetates to alcohols is typically at least about 97.5 and butyl acetate concentration in the still base effluent is less than about 0.5 .Generally speaking. the butanol concentration in the still bottoms stream will average about 5 lOS. Operating temperature in the transesterification column is not considered critical. Elevated temperatures can be used to obtain more rapid reaction rates. but temperatures will be limited primarily by the pressure limitations of the equipment. It should be appreciated. however, that elevated pressure may affect the composition of any azeotrope formed. For example. in the case of the butanol butyl acetate azeotrope. higher column pressures result in an azeotrope richer in butanol. While the selection of a transesterification catalyst is not considered critical, compounds of titanium are preferred since they are neutral, non corrosive liquids which leave no inorganic residue. The titanates may be either simple, mixed or partially hydrolyzed.Also useful are. e.g., the alkoxides of sodium and zirconium. The still bottoms stream from the reactive distillation column is fed into a stripping still atmospheric or sub atmospheric where butanol and butyl acetate are recovered overhead and combined with the overhead material from the reactive distillation still. The combined stream can either be used directly as partially converted feedstock in the manufacture of butyl acetate by esterification or separated into its components by known processing technigues for ultimate sale of the butyl acetate and for recycle of the butanol back to the transesterification column. The still bottoms stream from the butanol butyl acetate stripping still is fed to an appropriate vacuum stripping system e.g.. a conventional evaporator, a thin film or wiped film evaporator, or some combination of these for recovery of secondary tridecyl tetradecyl alcohols in the form of mixed isomers overhead and for recycle of titanium alcoholate catalyst residues back to the transesterification pre reactor. TheC13 C14 secondary alcohol mixture is used directly as a hydrophobe in the manufacture of non ionic surfactants or as an intermediate in the manufacture of anionic surfactants these conversions are accomplished by known art procedures however. and this technology does not constitute a part of the present invention. In view of the foregoing discussion regarding catalysts. it was unexpected that certain heterogeneous, strong acid resins are very effective catalysts for the carboxylic acid higher olefins reaction. These resins not only catalyze the acid reaction with both the a olefins and the internal olefins, but they do so at rates which permit their use in a packed fixed bed mode where contact times must necessarily be rather short. Thus, these resins are ideally suited for continuous process service. As heterogeneous catalysts. these resins offer all the other advantages inherent in such materials. e.g., ease of handling and storage.elimination of catalyst removal problems. regeneratability, low unit cost, low corrosivity. and ease of ultimate disposal through land fill measures. among others. In the present process, the formation exclusively of secondary esters as a mixture of isomers from either a olefins or internal olefins is desirable because the propertiesQf the surfactants derived from the secondary alcohol products are enhanced by the presence of a multiplicity of isomers. Two classes of strong acid resins can be used as catalysts in the acetoxylation step of the instant process. namely. 1 copolymeric. high flourine content aliphatic sulfonic acids of the type exemplified by DuPonts NafionS H. and .2 macroreticular. cross linked sulfonated styrene divinyl benzene copolymers of the type exemplified by Rohm and Haas AmberlystE 15,Amberlyst xN l005. Amberlyst XE 372, etc. The macroreticular resins are particularly preferred catalysts because they are readily available, relatively inexpensive. and easily amenable to structural modification in order to tailor the catalyst for optimum performance in a specific reaction system.It should be emphasized that not all macroreticular, strong acid resins will function as effective catalysts in the process of this invention. Physical properties such as resin porosity, surface area and crosslink density are enormously important in determining the suitability of a given resin for use with a given reaction system. Catalyst selection will be a matter of choice. and selection of specific physical properties will depend upon the particular reactants involved. It may be said in general that the physical properties of the catalyst must be such as to permit ready diffusion of the reactant molecules into the catalyst structure to permit adequate contact with the catalytically active surfaces. Cross link density is considered to be particularly significant in this regard since it directly affects how much the catalyst resin can swell. In the case of styrene divinyl benzene copolymers. cross link density is considered to be directly related to the amount of divinyl benzene present. In general. a cross link density in the range of 18 21 will produce good results. while a cross link density of about 12 or less will be unsatisfactory.Similarly, a pore volume of more than about 30t, preferably 30 35 , is desirable. Olefins suitable for use as raw materials in this process for manufacturing detergent range secondary alcohols are the linear. terminal species of type I below and the linear. internal species of type Il below. I R1 CH CH2 11 R2 CH CH R3 The type I olefins so called olefins are the primary species used initially in the process however, the type I olefins are partially isomerized into the type II olefins by the acidic resin bed in the reaction zone consequently, the type I and type 11 olefins are both present in the recycle process stream. It is this concurrent isomerization reaction which is responsible for the broad isomer distribution present in the product secondary alcohols. For olefins of type I . Rl,a linear. unsubstituted alkyl radical of from 8 14 carbon atoms i.e., n octyl through n tetradecyl in the type II olefins.R2 and R3 are linear.unsubstituted alkyl radicals whose chain lengths must satisfy the relationship R2 R3 C8 C14. The number of internal isomers possible in olefins of type 11 is 4 with decene and undecene. 5 with dodecene and tridecene. 6 with tetradecene and pentadecene, and 7 with hexadecene.In the practice of the invention. mixtures of olefins are desirably employed because this approach gives the best performance characteristics in the surfactant product. For example. mixtures of 12, 13, and 14 carbon species are often ideal in surfactant applications. Due to certain separations which must be performed in this process, mixtures containing more than 2 adjacent carbon number species are best prepared by blending the products from separate runs, each made with mixtures of species two or less carbon numbers wide. Thus. if aC12 C15 secondary alcohol is desired. the preferred approach is to combine blend the products from separate runs made with a C12 C13 olefins mixture and a C14 C15 olefins mixture.The stipulation that R1. R2 and R3 in the generic formulae I and II be linear is made from a final product surfactant performance viewpoint only branched hydrophobe structures are generally less desirable than their linear counterparts because they are more difficultly biodegradable and therefore less clean environmentally. In practice. minor amounts of branched structures will be present in the final product because the linear a olef in feedstocks derived from petroleum cracking often contain small quantities of branched materials which arise from skeletal rearrangements which occur during the cracking operations. Thus, the stipulation that the olefin feedstocks be linear is not made with the intention of excluding from process suitability linear olefins having minor content of branched structures.Rather, the intention is to emphasize the desirability of avoiding intentional introduction of branched structures into the olefin feedstocks. Carboxylic acids suitable for use in the process of this invention are those of generic structure R4 CO2H wherein R4 may be hydrogen.an alkyl or an alkenyl radical. linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, containing from 1 5 carbon atoms. e.g., methyl. ethyl. propyl, isopropyl.n butyl, isobutyl, and vinyl. Further, the radicalR4, when not hydrogen, can be substituted by one or more other functional groups which are inert under the conditions of the process. Such functional groups include chlorine, bromine, alkoxy.thioalkoxy, cyano, and carboxyamido. WhenR4 is an alkenyl radical, the double bond should lie a, ss to the CO2H group. Examples of specific carboxylic acids which are suitable for use in the process include cyanoacetic acid, the mono , di , and trichloroacetic acids. methoxyacetic acid, triflouroacetic acid, 3 methylmercaptopropionic acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid. 2 cyanoacrylic acid. 2 chloroacrylic acid. and acryloxypropionic acid, Alcohols which are suitable for use in the process of this invention are those of generic 5 5 structure R OH wherein R may be a linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl radical of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. optionally substituted with other functional groups which are inert under the conditions of the process.Thus, other functional groups which can be present as substituents on theR5 alkyl or alkenyl radical are the same ones which are suitable for use as substituents on theR4 radical of the carboxylic acid reactant.Specific examples of alcohols which may be used in this process are methanol. ethanol. isopropanol, n propanol. isobutanol, n butanol. allyl alcohol.3 butene 2 ol. 2 cyanoethanol. 2 chloroethanol, 2 ethoxyethanol, 3 chloropropanol, 2 flouroethanol, methallyl alcohol. 2 butanol, and 2 ethylhexanol, In the alcohol moiety, unsaturation, if present. need not be located in any specific position relative to the OH group. Theoretically, the number of acid alcohol combinations which are possible with this invention is very large. Practically. however. the number is fairly small because only relatively few of the coproducts possible are valuable articles of commerce enjoying large, established markets. In this regard, the esters of acetic. acrylic. and methacrylic acids are particularly valuable coproducts for which large markets exist as solvents and monomers. respectively. Thus. coproducts such as ethyl. n propyl. isopropyl. n butyl. isobutyl. allyl. amyl and 2 ethoxyethyl acetates are particularly preferred species along with ethyl acrylate and the butyl acrylates. 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate. When all factors are taken into consideration, the most preferred coproducts in this process are the low alkyl esters of acetic acid. EXAMPLES The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention. but not in any way limit it.Example 1 This example illustrates the preparation of a mixture of secondary dodecyl acetates and secondary tetradecyl acetates by passing a 2 1 molar mixture of glacial acetic acid and Ethyl Corp.C12 C14 a olefins 67 33t by weight through a fixed bed reactor containing a polymeric, strongly acidic resin as catalyst. In Part A, the catalyst was Rohm Haas Amberlyst 15. a macroreticular.sulfonated styrene divinylbenzene copolymer supplied in the form of beads having particle sizes in the range of 300 1000 pm In Part B. the catalyst was DuPont s Nafion H, a perflourinated. aliphatic.sulfonic acid copolymer supplied in the form of aranules having particle sizes from 300 500 tim 6,35 1524 mm These catalysts were placed in a 1 4 x 60 stainless steel coil volume 25 cmh containing plugs of glass wool at both ends the Amberlyst 15 charge was 14 grams while the Nafion H charge was 22 grams. The coil reactor was connected to a coil preheater both reactor and preheater coils were contained within a pipe through which was circulated a heat exchange fluid maintained at the desired reactor temperature. The acetic acid a olefins mixed feedstock. pre heated to 700C to ensure homegeniety. was pumped through the preheater and then the reactor coil at 40 psig 2,76 bar pressure and various desired rates using a piston type pump withTeflons seals.The crude reaction effluent was optionally collected in a receiver and analyzed directly or passed into a vacuum stripping vessel for removal of acetic acid prior to analysis. In the particular experiments covered by this example.the former analytical approach was used. Analyses were performed instrumentally using a gas chromatograph equipped with a CarbowaxR 20M ChromosorbE T column. The above described reaction system was operated for 5 days 8 hour days on each of the catalysts. Table 1 contains a summary of results obtained during the third day of operation with each of these catalysts. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of carrying out the higher olefin carboxylic acid addition reaction with certain strongly acidic fixed bed catalysts. the results show the effects of residence contact time on both conversion and on product isomer distribution. It will be noted both that multiple isomers are formed in the reaction and that all isomers formed are of secondary structure. Both of these factors are important in terms of the anticipated end use surfactants of the secondary alcohol products of this process.The isomer distribution values cited in the tabulated data were normalized to a value of 1.0 for the major isomer formed. the 2 isomer i.e., 2 dodecyl acetate and 2 tetradecyl acetate . By NMR analysis. the second most prevalent isomer is the 3 isomer and the least prevalent isomer is the 4 isomer.

Prior to entering tne reactor. the preheated acid olefin mixed feedstock was passed through a heated 70 900C column containing Linden AW 200 molecular sieves for purposes of removing any water present in the feedstock. Crude reaction product from the reactor was collected in a receiver and analyzed by gas chromatography. as described in Example I. except that the GC column in this case was packed with 10 Apiezon L on Chromosorb WAW DMGS.

Example 3 Example 3A illustrates the preparation of the same products as Example 2 in the same reactor and with the same catalyst as used in Example 2. InExample 3A, however, the reactor temperature was only 118 1200C, as compared with 129 1430C inExample 2, and the olefin feedstock was recovered recycled material from previous experiments, whereas the olefin feedstock used in Example 2 had been fresh virgin a olefin. Thus, the Example 3 feedstock contained a large quantity 50 of internal double bond species arising from isomerization . whereas the Example 2 feedstock contained essentially only the more reactive terminal double bond species. Thus.Example 3A reflects a fully continuous process, where unreacted olefins would be recycled back to the reactor continuously while makeup fresh olefin is added, the olefin feedstock. therefore, tending to reach a steady state composition in terms of terminal internal double bond content. The above described system was operated for a total of 33 days 8 hour days . 26 of which were on the initial cycle of catalyst usage and 7 of which were on the regenerated cycle of catalyst usage. The total productivity for the 33 days of kg operation was 78.4 Qpunds of C13 cl4 acetates per kg pound of catalyst actual weight of products 4,76 kg 33,75 kg made was 10.58 pounds from 75.0 pounds of 2 1 molar ratio acid olefin feed. The structural characteristics of the product were similar to those of Example 2, four isomers being formed from each of the olefins present in the feedstock. Example 3B illustrates the use of another catalyst Amberlyst XE 372 in the equipment ofExample 3A and in conjunction with virgin fresh C13 C14 alpha olefin as feedstock. Amberlyst XE 372 is an aromatic, ring chlorinated version of Amberlyst 15. It differs from the latter mainly in the fact that it has greater thermal stability accordingly, the experiments with this resin were carried out at reactor temperatures of 140 1450C. The system described above was operated for a total of 34 days 8 hour days with the XE 372 resin. The breakdown of the 34 days of operation was as follows initial cycle 17 days 1st regeneration cycle 12 days 2nd regeneration cycle 5 days. The total productivity ko for the 34 days of operation was 111.56 pounds of kg acetates per pound of catalyst. The actual weight 6,63kg 39,5 kg of product made was 14.73 pounds from 87.7 pounas of feed. Structurally. the product was similar to that of Examples 2 and 3A. except for a somewhat higher content of the 2 isomers species relative to the other isomers. Comparative Example 3C illustrates the attempted use of another resin Amberlyst XE 365 as catalyst for the acid olefin reaction. AmberlystXE 365 is similar to Amberlyst 15 in chemical composition, but differs physically from both the former resin and the XE 372 resin in being less highly cross linked. having less surface area, and having a lower free pore volume.The parameters, as promulgated by Rohm Haas. are as follows Internal Surface Porosity Pore Cross linkResin Area. m Volume S Density. Amberlyst 15 55 36 18 21XE 372 50 30 35 18 21XE 365 25 12 10 12 Operation of the reactor system of Examples 3A,B on fresh virgin C13 C14 cr olefin feedstock using XE 365 catalyst provided conversions of only 5 7 at temperatures as high as 150 C and residence times as high as 30 35 minutes.Subjecting this resin to a typical regeneration procedure failed to improve the results. Clearly.XE 365 is not an acceptable catalyst for the acetic acid detergent range olef in reaction and its lack of activity vis a vis Amberlyst 15 and XE 372 must derive from differences in physical rather than chemical characteristics. Without intending to be bound to any particular theory. it is believed that the smaller pore size of the XE 365 precludes diffusion of the relatively large olefin molecules into the resin matrix. so that the resin really does not behave as a macroreticular substance. In any case, this example demonstrates that not all macroreticular strong acid resins are useful as catalysts with these particular reactants in this step of the instant process.ExamPle 4 This example provides further illustration of the preparation of secondary tridecyl and secondary tetradecyl alcohol acetates mixed isomers by the reaction of a 2 1 molar mixture of acetic acid and C13 Cl4 a olefins in a fixed bed reactor using Amberlyst XE 372 as catalyst. At various times during the experiments, the feedstock was virgin alpha olefin, recovered olef in. or a mixture of 2 parts recovered olefin and 1 part virain olefin.In this example however the 25,4 .305 mm reactor used was a jacketed. 1 x 12 type 316L 152 mm stainless steel pipe packed with a 6 layer 35 grams of Amberlyst 372 resin contained between two layers of glass beads located at inlet and outlet of reactor and supported on restrained by fine mesh stainless steel screens. In place of the heated molecular sieve containing feedstock cleanup column described in Example 2 there was used a similar heated 70 800C column packed withAmberlyst 15 resin. This column operated as a pre reactor, the function of which was to remove tramp metal ions. particularly iron, from the feedstock. The Amberlyst 15 resin in the pre reactor is thus being utilized as an ion exchange resin. This step is very desirable in order to maximize catalyst life in the main reactor.Reactor temperature was controlled by circulating a heat exchange fluid of desired temperature through the jacket portion of the reactor. An alternate or supplemental reactor similar in design and temperature control mode to the first. but containing Amberlyst 15 resin rather than XE 372, was located in the process train between the cleanup column and the primary reactor. Flows through this alternate reactor could, if desired. be isolated from the primary reactor so that one reactor could be operated while the other was being regenerated. In the experiments of this example1 the process stream flowed through this secondary reactor. but no reaction occurred at this point because the temperature was maintained below 100 C. Samples taken from the base of the secondary reactor during operation confirmed the fact that substantially all reaction was taking place in the primary reactor. The above described system was operated for a total of 63 days. of which the first 31 represented the initial cycle of catalyst usage. the next 21 the first regeneration cycle of catalyst usage. and the last 11 the second regeneration cycle of usage. During the initial cycle test, the operation was carried out on an around the clock basis 24 hours day , except for one major planned shutdown holiday vacation period and several minor unplanned shutdowns caused by power outages. During this initial cycle of resin usage. the feedstock was a 2 1 molar mixture of acetic acid and virgin fresh C13 C14 olefin. The reactor temperature ranged from 134 1400C. the reactor 2,55 2,9 bar pressure from 37 42 psig, and the reactor residence contact time from 20 31 minutes.For this initial kg cycle, productivity was 493.6 pounds of kg acetates pound of resin with conversions olefin basis ranging from 15.4 31.9S of the theoretical.During the first regeneration cycle of resin usage1 the feedstock was virgin alpha olefin for days 1 8. a 2 1 w w mixture of recovered virgin olefins for days 9 12, virgin olefin for days 13 15, 2 1 w w recovered virgin mixture for days 16 19. and virgin a olefin for days 20 21. Over the course of this cycle of resin usage. reactor temperature ranged EMI32.1 trom 135 142gC, reactor pressure fromt40 43 pslg and residence time from 21 29 minutes. Operation during this cycle was on a 24 hours day, 5 days week basis.For this cycle of resin usage, productivity kg kg was 247.8 pounds acetates pound resin, raising the cumulative productivity for the resin charge to i ,r . 741.3 pounds pound . Converions olefin basis during the first regeneration cycle ranged from 12.3 36.6 of the theoretical. During the second regeneration cycle of resin usage. the feedstock used was virgin a olefin for days 1 2, recovered olefin for days 3 6. and 2 1 recovered virgin mixture for days 7 11. Reactor temperature during this cycle ranged from 135 1420C, reactor pressureEMI32.2 fromt40 50 psig and residence time from 19 25 minutes. Operation during this cycle was once again on a basis of 24 hours day, 5 days week. In this cycle of resin usage, productivity was 100.1 pounds kg acetates kg pound. resin with conversions olefin basis ranging from 14.8 34.7 of the theoretical.Cumulative productivity of the resin charge after three cycles of resin usage was 841.4 pounds pound.Example 5 This example illustrates the basic concept of coproducing detergent range C13 C14 in this case 2 alcohols and butyl acetate via single pass.continuous transesterification reactive distillation of the precursor 20 alcohol acetates with n butyl alcohol. The reactive distillation was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a 60 tray glass Oldershaw column volumn of column approximately 55 ml. mounted above a 300 ml glass kettle which served as the reboiler. A pre heated mixture of refined C13 C14 20 alcohol acetates approx. 46 54 w w , made as described in the preceding examples. and tetraisopropyl titanate catalyst TyzorTPT was pump fed into the top section of this column while excess n butyl alcohol was simultaneously pump fed through a vaporizing preheater into the bottom section of the column.The overhead material distillate from the column a mixture of n butanol and n butyl acetate was removed continuously on a total make basis. i.e., no reflux was carried on the column. A relatively constant volume approx. 100 ml of liquid was maintained in the reboiler by continuous removal.from the base of the still, of a crude product stream at a rate such that a volume time increment balance was maintained between the reactants fed to the column and the products removed therefrom. The crude product stream from the base of the still was collected in a chilled receiver in order to quench the reaction for analytical purposes. At selected time intervals the overhead and still bottom makes were collected. weighed and analyzed for composition by gas chromatography using a 40 Apiezon L 20S onChromasorb Q 60 80 chromatographic column. Prior to their analysis, the still bottoms stream samples were treated with water approx. lg lOg of sample to hydrolyze the catalyst residues to TiO2 and to liberate the product 20 alcohols present as exchanged catalyst complex.The hydrolyzed samples were then centrifuged and the clear supernatant liquid layer was used for the GC analysis. Operation of the above described reactive distillation system is summarized in Table III for comparative purposes. the results obtained from one experiment using a shorter distillation column 40 trays versus 60 trays of otherwise identical design are included in the tabulated data. The data from this example demonstrate that the concept of continuous transesterification to coproduce detergent range 20 alcohols and low molecular weight esters is viable. but that conversion of the 2e alcohol acetates is incomplete even with a 60 tray column under conditions of simple single pass operation. The best conversion achieved in thisExample was 93 mol S this conversion was attained under conditions wherein a larger excess of butanol reactant and a longer residence time in the column were used.This observation suggested the need for certain changes in both design and operation of the continuous still. Example 6, following, illustrates the attainment of significantly higher conversion levels through the use of higher butanol fatty alcohol acetate ratios in conjunction with a pre reaction step wherein the 20 alcohol acetate catalyst feed mixture to the column inExample 5 was replaced by a partially reacted feed mixture.

ExamPle 6 This example illustrates the coproduction of detergent range 2 alcohols and butyl acetate by continuous transesterification of the precursor 20 alcohol acetates with butanol in the presence of tetrabutyl titanate Tyzor TBT catalyst under conditions wherein very high conversions are attained. The principal factor responsible for the higher conversions attained in this example vis a vis that of Example 5 is the use of a pre reaction step wherein a minor portion of the overall butanol reactant charge is mixed with the fatty alcohol ester and catalyst and allowed to undergo partial reaction prior to entering the top of the still column as the column feed. In the experiments of this example. the pre reaction step was conducted right in the feed line between the pump and the top of the still column.This was accomplished by using a jacketed feed line with a hot heat exchange fluid circulating through the jacket. The pertinent data of Example 6 are summarized in Tables IVA and IVB the major difference in the two experiments was that the IVB runs were conducted at somewhat higher butanol fatty ester mol ratios. both in the pre reaction step and overall. The beneficial changes made in moving from the simple single pass operations ofExample 5 to the pre reaction step. single pass operation of Example 6 are apparent in a comparison of the conversions attained in the two examples.With the pre reaction step. conversions were in the 93 mol z from the simple single pass operation. The results presented in Tables IVA and IVB demonstrate the viability of the concept of continuous transesterification as a route to detergent range 2e alcohols and low molecular weight esters.

The crude reaction product was first continuously stripped of acetic acid at atmospheric pressure using a 5 tray column and subseauentlv . . 239 mbar continuously stripped of unreacted olefins at 180 mmw Hg pressure in a 35 tray vacuum still. Thus, the material used as feedstock for the continuous transesterification reaction of this example was entirely representative of that which would be expected from a fully integrated. continuous operation. Table V summarizes results obtained from pre reaction mode. continuous transesterification using crude 2 alcohol acetates as feedstocks.Conversions attained in these experiments ranged from 94.6 96.0 mol . The fact that these conversions are slightly below those obtained in experiments with refined 2e alcohol acetate feedstock is probably due to the use of lower overall butanol fatty ester mol ratios in this case rather than to any difference in feedstock quality.In fact, the generally excellent results obtained with the crude acetate feedstock attest to the eleanness of the overall process.

A preheated mixture of appropriate detergent range olefin e.g.. a c13 Cl4 mixture and acetic acid molar ratio of acid olefins 2 1 is pumped through a series of two packed bed reactors containing Amberlyst 15 resin. The first bed, a stream cleaning bed, is heated to 60 70 C the second bed, a reactor. bed, is heated to 3.45bar 114 1180C at about 50 psig pressure. The residence time in the reactor bed is approximately 25 minutes. The effluent from the reactor is a homogeneous, amber colored liquid containing about 30 acetic acid. 54 C13 C14 olefins. and 16 C13 C14 secondary alcohol acetates. The effluent from the above reactor bed is pumped into the middle portion of 10 tray stripping still operated at vapor temperature of 1170C. a kettle temperature of 240 2500C and a reflux ratio of 1.5 1. Acetic acid is removed overhead continuously while a mixture of C13 C14 olefins and C13 C14 secondary alcohol acetates is continuously removed from the base of the still.This still bottoms stream is dark amber in color and contains 0.1 acetic acid. Its composition is approximately 64 36 C13 C14 olefins C13 C14 secondary alcohol acetates. The overhead stream from the stripping still is recycled back to the acid olefin reactor bed. The stripping still bottoms stream is preheated to 1500C and then pumped to a 30 tray refining still, the feed entering the column at the tray 20 point 2 3 of the way up the column. This still is operated at a pressure of 180 mm.. a reflux ratio of 4.5 2, a residence time of 6 8 minutes. and a reboiler kettle temperature of 2400C. A stream containing 97.5 1001 C13 Cl4 olefins is continuously removed from the top of the still.while a stream containing 96.9 99.5 C13 C14 secondary alcohol acetates is continuously removed from the reboiler. The overhead stream, comprised of both terminal and internal C13 C14 olefins.is recycled back to the olefin acetic acid packed bed reactor. The kettle stream, comprised ofC13 C14 secondary alcohol acetates. is used as feedstock in the next step of the process. The still bottom stream from the above separation step is mixed with sufficient n butanol and tetrabutyl titanate to give a transesterification feedstock of composition of weight 76.2 C13 Cl4 secondary alcohol acetates, 20.0 n butanol. and 3.8 tetrabutyl titanate. This mixture is prereacted in a heated line 115 1280C for about 30 minutes before passing into the top section of a 60 tray transesterification column which is fed at the bottom with preheated. boiling n butanol. The overall mol ratio of n butanol C13SCl4 secondary alcohol acetates is about 4.1 1 and the overall catalyst concentration is about 0.05 0.06 mol liter.The ester exchange reaction occurs as the prereacted C13 Cl4 secondary alcohol acetate drops down the column counter current to the boiling n butanol. The column is operated at a reboiler kettle temperature of 225eC and a vapor temperature of 116 117eC. Feed rates are such as to give a residence time in the column of 10 12 minutes.The column is operated on a total overhead make basis the overhead stream is a butanol butyl acetate mixture of about 65 35 weight ratio. The make rate from the reboiler kettle is adjusted as necessary to maintain a reboiler temperature of 225 C. The make stream from the reboiler is a mixture of n butanol. n butyl acetate. C13 C14 secondary alcohols a and C13 Cl4 secondary alcohol acetates in the approximate weight percentages of 10 12. 0.5 1, 82 84, and 4 6. respectively. Also contained in the kettle make stream. but not detected analytically by the GC method used, is a non volatile titanate catalyst residue. The light species n butanol and n butyl acetate present in the transesterification still bottoms stream are removed from this stream in an atmospheric pressure continuous flashµ still similar in design and operation to that used for the acetic acid stripping described above.Alternatively. the still can be operated under vacuum, if so desired. The overhead make stream contains n butanol and n butyl acetate in a weight ratio approximately 10 1. This stream is combined with the overhead make from the continuous transesterification still for subsequent processing. The still bottoms stream from the above flash stripping distillation has a composition of approximately 79 81 C13 Cl4 secondary alcohols. 6 8S secondary alcohol acetates. 11 13 non volatiles catalyst residues and 0.5 3.5t olefins and other miscellaneous unidentified species. such as diols and diesters. This stream is fed into a demister equipped flash pot type evaporator operated at a kettle temperature of 180 C, a pressure of 15 mm Hg, and a vapor temperature of 160 165 C. Operation under these conditions affords an overhead make distillate evaporator bottoms residue ratio of about 2.5 1.The distillate portion has a composition of approximately 90 C13 Cl4 secondary alcohols.7 9 C13 C14 secondary alcohol acetates. and 1 3 of olefins. diols. diesters. etc., as unidentified materials. The color of the distillate fraction is 20 30 Pt Co and its specific gravity is 0.82 0.83 g cm . This stream represents product of acceptable quality for further processing. The evaporator bottoms stream, having a viscosity of mmê s about 40 50 cks and a gravity of 0.86 0.87, contains about a 2 1 ratio of volatile non volatile species.as judged by behavior in a gas chromatograph. The evaporator bottoms stream from the flash pot evaporator is passed into a wiped f ilm type evaporator for further recovery of product.This evaporator is operated at a temperature of 2,7 6,7 mbar 160 1800C and a pressure of 25 mm Hg . Under these conditions 95 of the volatiles present in the feed to the unit is removed as distillate similar in composition to that from the flash pot evaporator, but of somewhat higher color 60 70 Pt Co . Accordingly, this overhead stream is fed back into the flash pot evaporator for ultimate recovery as acceptable quality product. The residues non volatiles stream from the wiped film evaporator consists predominantly of organic titanates and high boiling by products, such as diols, diesters, etc. The organic titanates in this stream are still active transesterification catalysts. Accordingly, this stream is recycled back to the transesterification column after removal of a suitable purge stream to prevent a continuing build up of high boiling by products in the process train.
