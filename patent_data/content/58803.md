# Data recording machine.

## Abstract
A cash register with a keyboard 31 , journal printer 47 and a check slip printer 32 is controlled by a microprocessor system with a CPU 102 , a program ROM 105 and an RAM 106 including various registers for storing running totals of various types. The printer 32 prints till receipts and end of day check slips authenticating non rigged operation of the cash register. Thus, each time such a check slip is printed a fresh bit of an EPROM memory 160 is set from 1 to 0 under control of a register 181 and a pulser circuit 191 , the EPROM being fixed non removably to the machine and shielded against UV erasure. The printed check slip includes the serial number thereof as represented by the EPROM contents, a special symbol identifying a non manipulatable machine and the machine number recorded in a section 161 of the EPROM. In a modified embodiment the EPROM is replaced by a counter, e.g. a mechanical counter, which can only be incremented and cannot be decremented or zeroized . The counter is incremented each time a check slip is printed and the number in the counter is included in the printout. Check slips with unbroken series of check slip numbers provide evidence of non rigged operation.
