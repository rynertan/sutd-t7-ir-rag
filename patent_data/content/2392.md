# 1 SUBSTITUTED 3 ACYLPYRROLE DERIVATIVES, PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND PLATELET AGGREGATION INHIBITING AGENTS CONTAINING THEM

## Abstract
The invention provides 1 substituted 3 acylpyrroles of the formula The compounds of the invention, unlike known 3 acyl 1 substituted pyrrole derivatives, have high platelet aggregation inhibiting activities and low antiinflammatory activities. They may be made by acylating a 1 substituted pyrrole in the 3 position by reaction with an anhydride or halide of a carboxylic acid of the formula COOH, in the presence of an acid catalyst, and if desired subjecting the products to oxidation, hydrolysis, amidation or acetal forming reaction.
