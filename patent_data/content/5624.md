# Hydrostatic bearing.

## Abstract
A hydrostatic bearing with structural features to improve the harmony between hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces set up in the bearing fluid, and to diminish the harmful effects of hydrodynamic forces when there is relative motion between the bearing members 1, 2 . These features may comprise channels 32, 33 in the bearing land to maintain tranverse hydrostatic fluid flow beneath the land despite longitudinal dynamic forces, longitudinal channels 51 in the bearing surfaces 50 to diminish dynamic friction without unduly diminishing the resistance to hydrostatic fluid flow across these channels, and means 70 to guide fluid recirculation within the bearing recess 3 so as to avoid shearing contact between oppositely moving streams of fluid within it.
