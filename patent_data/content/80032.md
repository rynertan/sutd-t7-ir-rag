## Description
PHARMACEUTICALL PREPARATION TREATING HERPETIC LESIIONS This invention relates to the treatment of infections caused by Herpes simplex virus. More particularly, this invention relates to the treatment of Herpes labialis andHerpes genitalis in humans by topical administration of human interferon Infections with Herpes simplex virus are extremely common in man throughout the world. Primary infection by the virus usually occurs early in life. In its most com .mon clinical form, Herpes labialis, the symptoms include inflammation of the mouth and gums as well as mouth erup tions In some cases, the genital area may be infecte by frees simplex virus producing Herpes geflitalis., Herpes simplex virus may also infect the eye, producing acute keratitis which may permanently affect the cornea. Following initial attack, symptoms disappear but the the virus survives in latent form in its host, probably in ganglia. Recurrent. attacks may follow nonspecific stimuli such as fever. Lt is thought that a deficiency of the im mune system of the host is the most significant factor in reactviating the virus. The virus is transmitted by contamination with droplets e.g., from saliva, or by direct contact. It is estimated that 70 908 of all adults have antibodies against the virus. However, the antibodies appear to be ineffective in prevent ing recurrences. Although it was once thought that onlyasingle type of Herpes simplex virus existed, with possibly some minor antigenic variants, it is now known that there are two major types of the virus, differing antigenically and biologically. Herpes simplex virus Type I is an oral type and is usually the cause of Herpes labialis. Herpes simplex virus Type II is a genital type and is usually the cause of Herpes genitalis., However, Herpes simplex virus Type I has been isolated from genital lesions in some instances, while Herpes simplex virus Type II has been isolated from lesions on other parts of the body. Herpes genitalis is a distressing condition. It is the second most common veneral disease in young adults.Herpes genitalis often causes severe psychological and social problems for affected individuals. Infection can be fatal in patients with deficient immune systems. Herpes ge nitalis has been associated with cancer of the genital organs in both men and women. It also poses the threat Q. infection to nwborns of infected mothers. At present, there is no known effective therapy against Herpes I abialis and Herpes genitalis, although some antiherpetic agents, such as trifluorothymidine, idoxouridine, and cytosine arabinoside, have been reported to be effective in the treatment of acute keratitis caused by Herpes s clex infections of the eye.However, these drugs are toxic and some individuals are allergic to these drugs. Firdiermore, some of these drugs, such as idoxouridine, are indicated only in the treatme nt ofHerpes simplex kerzo s. Studies report that treatment with these drugs suppresses but does not eradicate the virus and that relapse may occur when treatment ceases. It would thus be desirable to provide a pharmaceutical agent which is effective against Herpes labial is and Herpes genitalis. It would also be desirable if the pharmaceutical agent which is effective against Herpes labialis andHerpes genitalis is also nontoxic. It would also be desirable if the pharmaceutical agent reduced the incidence of recurrent attacks of Her pes labials and Herpes genitalis. Interferons are proteins produced by cells in response to the action of specific inducers, such as viruses.They may be produced in vivo by living organisms or in vitro by tissue cultures in response to the presence of the inducer. There are three main varieties of human interferon leukocyte also known as alpha alpha , fibroblast also known as ss , and lmaune also known as y interferon.There are now known to be several subvarieties of human leukocyte C and fibroblast c interferon The interferons are known to be effective antiviral agents F irtiier, the interferons are known to be effective against a broad spectrum of viruses. They are also nontoxic and nonantigenic. Thus, the interferons offer hope as effective nontoxic pharmaceutical agents against herpetic lesions. Up to now, treatment of herpetic lesions with in terferon has proceeded along two main courses a medicinal induction of endogenic interferon in the patient and b administration of exogenic interferon to the patient. For example, U.S. 4,053,582 Stickl discloses a method of treating Herpes genitalis and Herpes labialis by administering attenuated fowl pox virus to the patient.The attenuated fowl pox virus induces the patient to produce interferon. Within a few days, the eruptions caused by Herpes simplex virus are healed. U.S. 4,061,538 Dorner et al. and 4,184,917 Dorner et al. disclose a method of treating Herpes simplex viral infections in rabbits by systemic administration of a structurally modified interferons. These patents disclose that the modified interferons may be systemically adminis tered to the host by injection or paxenterally, for example, by intravenous administration. Thus, none of these patents discloses a method of treating Herpes labialis or Herpes genitalis by topical administration of interferon to the lesions. Because viral multiplication occurs at the site of lesions, it is expected that local administration of human interferon to herpetic lesions is a more effective method of treating Herpes labialis and Rerpes genitalis than previously disclosed methods. Several published reports already disclose the treatment of herpetic eye infections by the topical administration of human interferon. For example, D. Neumann Haefelin, et al., in Infection and mztnmity, 17, 468 1977 , disclose that topically applied human leukocyte and fibroblast interferon prevents Herpes simplex Type I virus induced keratitis in monkeys. B.R. Jones et al., in Lancet ii, 128 1976 report that topically applied purified human leukocyte interferon is effective for treating herpetic keratitis in humans R. Sundmachner, et al., in Lancet , t disclose that herpec keratitis in humans can be treated by the topical administration of leukocyte interferon and tri flurothymidine. However, none of these publications discloses the treatment of Herpes labialis and Herpes genitalis by the topical administration of human interferon. Moreover, none of these publications discloses interferon containing phar maceutical preparations suitable for treating herpetic lesions. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for treating lesions due toHerpes labialis and e rpes genitalis by topically applying human interferon to the lesions. It is also an object of the present invention to provide interferon containing pharmaceutical preparations which are suitable for treating herpetic lesions by topv ically applying the preparations to the lesions. How these and other objects of this invention are achieved will become apparent in light of the accompanying disclosure and claims. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A method for treating Herpes labialis and Herpes genitalis lesions according to the present invention comprises administering locally an effective amount of a pharmaceutical preparation containing human interferon to the lesions. For purposes of the present invention, an effective amount of human interferon comprises about lox106 100x106, preferably lOx106 50x106, I.U. per day. Pharmaceutical preparations in accordance with the present invention comprise human interferon and a physiologically acceptable carrier, such as distilled water.Desirably, the pharmaceutical preparations further comprise.an effective amount of a stabilizer, a preservative, an antibiotic, an anti viral agent, or an anti inflammatory agent DETAIIED DRSCRIP ION OF THE INVENTION In its latent form, Herpes simplex virus resides in the neurones of sensory ganglia. Upon reactivation, vi , ral multiplication occurs at the site of the lesion.Thus, lesions due to Herpes labialis and Herpes genitalis may be treated rapidly and effectively by topically administering a human interferon containing composition in an effective dosage to the blistered lesions. In the practice of the present invention, comprising the treatment of Herpes labialis and Herpes genitalis lesions by topically administering hus2n interferon con taining composition to the lesions, any of the known human interferons can be employed. Thus, the composition may contain human leukocyte, fibroblast, or immune interferon or mixtures thereof in suitable dosage. The interferon may suitably be prepared by well known cLassical methods or by recombinant DNA methods. Satisfactory results in healing the herpetic lesions are obtained when the human interferon is administered lo cally at a high concentration in a short period of time. An effective dosage for treating herpetic lesions is about lxlO6 lOOxlO6, perferably about 10xl06 50x1O6, I.U. per day.It may be perferable to apply the interferon containing composition in a single daily dose rather than in several smaller doses. No special preparation or pretreatment is required prior to local administration of the human interferon. Generally the lesions are noticeably improved within hours of local administration of the human interferon. The lesions are completely healed within 48 hours and the in cidence of recurrent attacks is significantly diminished. Local administration of the interferon may be effected by directly applying an interferon containing composition to or in areas adjacent to the Herpes labialis or Herpes genitalis lesions. Since it is generally desirable that the interferon be immediately released into the site of the Lesions, it is preferable to apply the interferon in liquid form, for example by suspending it in an aqueous physiologically acceptable carrier. After a suitable period of time, the interferon containing composition can readily be removed from the lesions, for example by washing. Distilled water is the preferred carrier.Other suitable carriers include a saline solution,a buffer solution, alcohol, etc. The interferon containing composition may al so be directly applied to the lesions in the form of an aerosol when combined in liquid formwitha pronel lant. Where. slow release of the interferon is desired, the interferon may be applied as an. ointment or cream to. the lesions. For exa ple, the interferon may be incorporated in an oil in water.emulsion or in a physiologically acceptable hydropm lwc carrier. When very slow release of the interferon is desired, it may be incorporated in an aqueous carrier and then formed into a water in oil emulsion or it may be incorporated in a physiologically acceptable hydrophonic carrier. Physiologically acceptable carriers include gelatine, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohol, gums, polyalkylene glycols, White Fetroleum jelly, etc. Local adminis ton of the interferon may also be effected by subctc ecus injection directly into or in areas closely adjacent to the lesions. For injection, the interferon should be in liquid form, i.e associated with an aqueous physiologically acceptable carrier such as distilled water. In addition to the carrier, an interferon containing pharmaceutical preparation according to the present invention may additionally contain suitable amounts of desirable adjuvants. For example, the preparation may desirably contain a stabilizer which increases the antiviral effectiveness of interferon. Bovine serum albumin BSA is a preferred stabilizer because it increases the effectiveness of interferon by adsorbing it to retain its conformation. The preparation may also desirably contain a preservative, such as glycerine. It may further be desirable to incorporate additional therapeutic agents, for example, suitable antibiotics, in the interferon containing pharmaceutical preparations. For example, a mixture of bacitracin and neomycin sulfate in effective dosages may suitably be included in the prepara tion. In this way, it is possible to protect the patient against infection by ordinary germs while being treated for Herpes labialis and Herpes genitalis. It may further be desirable to include in suitable dosage a broad spectrum anti viral agent in the interferoncontaining composio, Acyclovir is a suitable antiviral agent of this category. Alternatively, it may be desirable to include in suitable dosage a more specific antiherpetic agent, such as trifluorothymidine. It may further be desirable to include in the pharmaceutical preparation a suitable dosage of an anti inflammatory agent Anti inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, reduce the pain acccmpanying the lesions. Anti inflammatory agents, such as the proteolytic enzyme bromelaine, are believed to speed healing and accelerate tissue repair, as well as ease pain. Other suitable anti flammatory also may be included in the interferon containing pharmaceutical prepara tion. It should be emphasized that treatment of Herpes labialis and Herpes genitalis in accordance with the practices of the present invention does not eradicateHerpes simplex virus from its host. The virus continues to reside in latent form in the neurones of sensory ganglia,However, local administration of human interferon contain ing compositions retards viral multiplication at the site of the lesions and.promotes healing of the lesions. In addition, local administrations of human interferon containing compositions appears to reduce recurrences of Herpes labialis and Herpes genitalis. The following examples are intended to illustrate more clearly the practices of the present invention. Exampl e 1 Patient A, a female, suffering from recurrent attacks of Herpes geflitalis, may be treated with human interferoncontaining pharmaceutical preparations in accordance with the present invention. On the average, manifestations occur every 8 weeks and symptoms last for about 10 days.At the next outbreak, she is treated by directly applying a pharmaceutical preparation containing 1x108 I.U. human leukocyte interferon per ml of distilled water as a carrierThree drops are applied at intervals of 6 hours Within 4 hours there is noticeable improvement. Within 48 hours the eruptions are copletely healed. Treatment continues for another 48 hours. The patient is free of recurrences and complaints for the next six months. Example 2 Patient B, a male suffering from recurrent attacks from Herpes Iabialis, may be treated in accordance with practices of the present invention. On the average, manifestations occur every 6 months and last for 10 days. The patient is treated once a day with three drops of the pharmaceutical preparation of Example 1. The skin eruptsis start to dry up within hours and are completely gone. within 48 hours. mCam p Ie 3 Patient C, a male suffering from recurrent attacks of Herpes genitalis, may be treated in accordance with the practices of the present invention. On the average, manifestations recur frequently. The patient is treated with a pharmaceutical preparation containing human leukocyte interferon of high activity lilt I.U. mg. and the antiviral agent acyclovir in,a Neobase carrier, The ointment is applied at 6 hour intervals. Noticeable improvement occurs within hours and the lesions are completely heared within 48 hours. While the inventIon has been described by reference to specific embodiments, this was for purposes of illustration only and should not be construed to limit the spirit or scope of the invention.
