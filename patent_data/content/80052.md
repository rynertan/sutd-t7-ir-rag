# Improved catalyst composition for copolymerizing ethylene.

## Abstract
Ethylene copolymers having improved resistance to pinstriping and gel streaking when extruded into film can be produced by continuously copolymerizing ethylene with one or more higher alpha olefin monomers in a low pressure gas phase reaction with a catalyst composition prepared by forming a precursor composition from a magnesium com pound, titanium compound, and electron donor compound diluting said precursor composition with a silica support which has been treated with a dialkylzinc compound and activating the diluted precursor composition with an or ganoaluminum compound.
