## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION FOR THE TREATMENT OF HAIR LOSS The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or arresting scalp hair loss and or promoting scalp hair growth and in particular to a composition for topical application. The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or arresting scalp hair loss and or promoting scalp hair growth comprising an antiandrogen, an oestrogen and a thyroid hormone. The compositions according to the invention may in general be used either by male or female patients. An antiandrogen is herein defined as an agent which suppresses the secretion of androgens from either the adrenal glands or testes or ovaries either by suppressing pituitary gonadotrophin or ACTH secretion or reducing androgen secretion directly from the adrenal glands, ovaries or testes themselves, or is effective locally within the tissues by either displacing androgen fromWits tissue receptor or competing with its action, or which has an opposite action to androgens e.g. oestrogen or impairs the conversion of an androgen substrate to its biologically more active form as testosterone or dihydrotestosterone e.g. 5 alpha reductase inhibitors such as progesterone , or inhibits in any other way the synthesis and or the secretion and or the action of androgens. The composition according to this invention includes at least one oestrogen, e.g. oestradiol or a pharmaceutically suitable derivative thereof such as oestradiol benzoate, or ethinyloestradiol, in combination with at least one non oestrogenic antiandrogen such as a progesterone like compound e.g.medroxyprogesterone acetate or a similarily pharmaceutically acceptable derivative of medroxyprogesterone.Another suitable non oestrogenic anti androgen for use in the compositions according to this invention would be cyproterone acetate or another pharmaceutically suitable derivative of cyproterone. Although cyproterone acetate and medroxyprogesterone acetate are the preferred antiandrogens for use in the compositions according to the invention, other antiandrogens having a progesteronelike activity may suitably be employed. These include allyloestrenol,gestronol e.g. as the hexanoate , dydrogesterone, norgestrel, levonorgestrel, norethisterone, hydroxyproqesterone e.g. as the hexanoate , progesterone itself, cimetidine or azelaic acid. The thyroid hormone present in the preparations according to the invention is preferably triiodothyronine or a pharmaceutically suitable derivative or precursor therefor. Alternatively, the thyroid hormone may be thyroxine. Thyroxine exerts most, if not all, of its biological activity by conversion in the body to triiodothyronine. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are preferably formulated as creams, gels, ointments, pastes or lotions for topical application.For this purpose, any suitable carrier system normally employed in the preparation of such pharmaceutical compositions may be employed. For instance, the ingredients may be dispersed in an ointment base such as ùnguentum merck or dissolved in a lotion base such as aqueous ethanol. Systemic treatment using the oral or Darenteral routes is also possible. The compositions may suitably provide a concentration of anti androgen of at least O.Ol percent by weight and a concentration of thyroid hormone suitable to provide from 2 200g per 3ml. 3 ml is a typical single dose. More preferably, the compositions may provide from 0.05 0. 4 by weight anti androgen, most preferably about 0.1t of each of an oestrogenic anti androgen such as oestradiol benzoate and a non oestrogenic antiandrogen such as medroxyprogesterone acetate. Most preferably, the composition provides about 20p g per 3ml dosage of the composition of triiodothyronine. Such a formulation is suitably applied about twice a day to the areas in which it is desired to prevent or arrest scalp hair loss and or promote scalp hair growth. The effectiveness of the compositions of the present invention may be enhanced by including therein other substances which are known to promote or suspected of being able to promote scalp hair growth. Examples of such substances are vasodilators, alpha adrenergic blockers, anab olie growth promoting agents, and second messenger hormone effector enzymes. The following examples illusirate the present invention, and tentative conclusions have been drawn from the results so far achieved. It must be recognised, however, that, although for the most part human beings react in similar ways to the same drugs, individuals vary considerably as to their sensitivity to a particular drug. Hence the lower limits suggested herebelow for the effective levels of the components must be regarded with caution. Clinical Studies 1. Effect of a Topical antiandrogen preparation on hair growth in four normal men compared with six untreated control rrn over one year Trichogen I Table 1 Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 Clinical studies using the application of a topical antiandrogen preparation were carried out in nale patients and the response in hair growth compared with an untreated control group using the technique of theUnit Area Trichogram as previously described The Unit Area Trichogram in the Assessment of Androgendependent Alopecia. Rushton H, James K C, Mortimer C H.British Journal of Dermatology 1983 , 109, 429 437 Four male patients aged between 27 years to 54 years with a history of common baldness of 6 to 24 years duration had Unit Area Tridiograms carried out before and after 12 months of applying a topical antiandrogen preparation coqprising Trichogen IOestradiol Benzoate 0.1 Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.12 3, 3 5 Triiodo L Thyronine Pree Acid 20ug per 3ml of solutionThe preparation, total volume 3ml, was applied twice daily to several sites in divided quantities to the frontal and vertex areas of the scalp. Six male volunteers aged between 21 to 34 years with a history of comon baldness of 11 2 to 6 years duration formed the control group and did not receive any treatment.Unit Area Trichograms in the occipital area were performed in 3 of the treatment group and 5 of the control group. The shaded area in the Figures identifies the normal range for the measurements shown and the individual syrribols correspond to the same subjects, set out in Table 1. All four men in the treatment group bad an increase in frontal total hair density hairs cm2 during 12 moths of thereapy. None of the men in the control group had an increase in frontal total hair density during 12 iTmths Figure 1 .Three of the treated men showed an increase in froutal meaningful hair density number of hairs greater than 40um in diameter cm2 it is these hairs which have the capability of growing to full length during 12 mcarfhs of therapy. In one patient the increase in frontal meaningful density was not significant. No man in the control group showed an increase in iraningfu1 hair density during 12 months Figure 2 .In each of the three treated men in Whom occipital total hair density was measured there was an increase during 12 months of treatmerrt. None of the five men in whom occipital total hair density measured in the control group showed an increase in occipital total hair density during 12 months Figure 3 .Two of the three men in the treatment gn p shoed an increase in occipital meaningful hair density number of hairs greater then 4 in diameter cm2 it is these bairs which have the capability of growing to full length duning 12 months of therapy whereas one patient renained unchanged. None of the five men in the control group showed an increase in occipital meaningful hair density during 12 months Figure 4 .Cooclusion me application of the above preparation Trichogen I, results in the arrest of the balding process with an increase in total hair density and meeningful hair density in both the frontal and occipital areas during 12 months of treatment. It is evident that there is cross cirolatico with the effective dispersal of local antiandrogen activity between the frontal and occipital areas.2.

There had been a deterioration in the patients Unit Area Tridhogram in the frontal area.At this stage it was decided to maintain the patients Piledroxyprogesterone Acetate intake but to add topical antiandrogen therapy asTrichogen IIMedroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.2 Oestradiol Berizoate 0.2 . 3,3,5 Triiodo L Thyronine Pree Acid in super saturated solution. 3,3 , 5 Triiodo D Thyronine Free Acid in super satureated solution. Phentolarnine Mesylate 0.1 as Rogitine, Ciba . The patient applied lml of the above preparation twice daily to the scalp.After 6 months of the same dose of systemic Medroxyprogesterone Acetate plusTrichogen II the following results were obtained Testosterone 31.0 nmol L n 10.32 SHBG 19.0 nmol L n 18 40 Oestradiol 125.0 pmol L n 50 180 Dihydrotestosterone 2.1 nmol L n 0.7 2.7 DHEAS 10.0 nmol L n 5 9 17 Hydroxyprogesterone 6.7 nmol L n 0.6 6.0 Androstenedione 5.8 nm L n 3.1 10.0 Seren Analysis Total Count 16.8 millions n greater than 80 millione Motility 65 n greater than 60 Abonormal forms 10 n up to 25 The Unit Area Trichogram showed Unit Area Trichogram Frontal Occipital Total Hair Density Haris cm2 307 n 256 393 282 n 261 356 Meaningful Hair Density 248 n 232 340 263 n 213 317 Hairs greater than 40um in diameter cm2 The above Unit Area Trichogram results are chown in diagramatic form Figure 5 . The above results show that in this patient with male pattern baldnessMedroxyprogesterone Acetate up to 40mg per day while being effective in most men to suppress pituitary LH and FSH secretion was not effective in reducing this patients circulating testosterone levels since in addition to androgens of testicular origin there was evidence of an adrenal source for these.During the first 6 months of systemic Medroxyprogesterone Acetate treatment there was no significant reduction in circulating androgen levels and the patients frontal hair density studies snowed a deterioration. There was an inprovement in the occipital region. This is generally to be expected since this area is more resistant to the. lalding process and recovers more quickly than the frontal area. It is probable that the inhibition of 5 alpha reductase activity with decreased conversion of testosterone to dihydrotentostorone in the scalp of the occipital area was sufficient to allow new hair growth without suppression of circulating androgen levels.After a further 6 months of systemic Medroxyprogesterone Acetate treatment circulating androgen levels were still not reduced and in fact higher than the basal levels. However, during this time, the addition of Triceogen II resulted in new hair growth in the frontal area. This must have been due to the local inhibition of androgen activity in the scalp by local absorption of Tridhogen II.3. Effect of a Topical Antiandrogen Preparation plus cyclic AMP ATP Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor on hair growth in a single nale patient Trichogen III Figures 6,7It is recognised that many hormones including steroids act by the activation of the cyclic AMP mechanism. In this process hormones interact with specific receptors on the cell membrane.This results in the activation of membrane booud adenylate cyclase which enhances the conversion of ATP Adenosine Triphosphate to cyclic AMP cyclic adenosine 3, 5, monophosphate . CyclicAMP is knawn as the ubiquitous second messenger since it is able to relay information derived from numerous substances binding at the cell surface.The cyclic AMP then activates a variety of protein kinases by combining with the regulatory sub group of the enzyme which is then dissociated from the catalytic sub group. The catalytic sub unit then catalyses the phospborylation of certain key proteins, usually enzymes, which then leads to the action of the original hormone which presented at the cell membrane.This mechanism also results in the elaboration of various proteins which rray themselves be hormones or comprise specific tissue e.g. muscle tissue, nerve tissue, hair. The process may also be modified by the availability of calcium, cyclic GMP cyclic guanosine 3, 5 monophosphate or other enzyme systems. Other hormones may achieve their action by entering the cell directly to bind with specific cytoplasmic receptors which are then modified and transport the hormone receptor complex into the nucleus where specific genes are activated to produce the end result.These mechanisms are shown diagramatically in Figure 6. Cyclic AMP is inactivated by phosphodiesterase.The latter enzyme itself can be inactivated by theophlline and caffeine thereby leading to an increase in the cyclic AMP concentration in certain tissues. In order to enhance the effects of the topical antiandrogen preparation a further solution was made up to contain TrichK n IIIOestradiol Benzoate 0.2t Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.2 3, 5 Triiodo L Thyronine Free Acid in super saturated solution Uhentolamine Mesylate 0.048 Cyclic AMP Free Acid 0.1 Cyclic AMP Sodium 0.05 ATP Magnesium 0.1 Choline Theophyllinate 0.05 A 25 year old wan with common baldness had previously leen treated with Medroxyprogesterone Acetate increasing to 40mg daily until 68 weeks when the dose was reduced to 20mg daily, then after 72 weeks to 10mg daisy until 78 wKfks when treatment wes seceped. m e results of the Unit Area Trichogram are chown in Figure 7.After 26 weeks without systemic Medroxyprogesterone Acetate the patient showd a decrease in total hair density in Mhe frontal site. After 52 weeks without treatment Where was also a marked decrease in meaningful hair desnsity in the frontal site. The cocipital region remained unchanged. Instead of re introducing systemic medroxyprogesterone Acetate the patient began treatment with the above preparation 2ml applied 4 times daily to the scalp in the frontal and vertex areas.After 26 weeks of topical treatment with Trichogen III there was an increase in total hair density in the frontal site from 179 hairs cm2 to 203 hairs cm2. There was also an increase in frontal meaningful hair density from 64 hairs cm2 to 93 hairs cm2. In the occipital region there was an increase in total hair density from 267 hairs cm2 to 293 hairs cm2 while meaningful hair density was not significantly changed from 239 hairs cm2 to 246 hairs cm2. The error bars of the trichogram technique are shown in the figure for each measurement. cinsi l The topical application of Trichogen III resulted in significantly increased total hair density and meaningful hair density in the frontal region. It is proposed the the addition of cycloc AMP, ATP and CholineTheophyllinate will enhance the anti androgenic action of Trichogen I andII.4. Ineffective Topical Preparations applied to the scalp.The following preparations were found to be ineffective in increasing hair density in common baldness in men a Oestradiol Benzoate 0.01 Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.01 3, 3 5 Triiodo L Thyronine Free Acid 20ug 3ml b Oestradiol Benzoate 0.18 3, 3 5 Triiodo L Thyronine Free Acid 20ug 3ml c Oestradiol Benzoate 0.1 Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.1 d Oestradiol Benzoate 0.1 e Oestradiol Benzoate 0.01 f Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.1 g Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.01 h 3, 3 5 Triiodo L Thyronine Free Acid 20ugl3ml i 3,3 5 triiodo D Thyronine Free acid was not an effective substitute in any concentration for the L form.j Progesterone 0.1 k Progesterone 0.01 None fo the men who received topical treatment had any systemic side effects.All retained normal potency and beard growth. Three men who received the highest concentration of individual hormonal constituents OestradiolBenzoate 0.2 , Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.2 , 3, 3 5 Triiodo L Thyronine Free Acid super saturated solution had full haematology, liver function tests, urea and electrolytes, endocrine profile and sperm mounts carried out before, after 3 months and after 6 months of applying the preparation 2m1 twice daily to the scalp without any significant change in the parameters measured.The patient who received this maximum concentration plus cyclic AMP free acid 0.1 cyclic AMP sodium 0.05 , ATP magnesium 0.1 , shentolamine 0.04 and Cnoline Theophyllinate 0.05 also bad no change in potency nor beard growth and without any significant change in laboratory investigations and sperm count when the same parameters were checked before, after 3 months and after 6 months of applying the preparation, 2ml 4 times daily to the scalp. All patients noted a decrease in the greasiness of the hair and improved condition and cosmetic appearance.Three patients who bad experienoed superficial scalp tenderness and irritation prior to treatment noted the rapid alleviation of these symptoms within 1 2 days of begining topical treatment and for its duration. 5, Optimum formulation of preparation Fran the above it is evident that Ocstradiol Benzoate 0.18 alone orMedroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.1 alone or 3, 3 5 Triiodo L Thyronine 20ug in 3ml of solution alone is not effective in producing hair growth in common baldness. Combinations of any two of the three are also not effective. 3, 3 5 Triiodo D Thyronine free acid is not an effective substitute for the L form.It appears necessary to conbine Oestradiol Benzoate, MedroxyprogesteroneAcetate with the Triiodothyronine to achieve therapeutic effect. When the above combination was used hit in reduced doses as OestradiolBenzoate 0.01 , Medroxyprogesterone Acetatc 0.01 while maintainingTriiodothyronine at 20ug 3ml there was no effect.Thus 1. The minimum effective se of Oestradiol Benzoate and Medroxy progesterone Acetate is between 0.01 and 0.1 when combined withTriiodothyronine at 20ug 3ml application.The ooncentration of the main ingredients could be Increased toOestradiol Benzoate 0.2 , Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 0.28 andTriiodothyonine to the poirt of producing a super saturated solution without causing local scalp irritation or prodducing systemic side effects. The solubility of these compounds in the solvent solution was rraxmai at room temperature.Thus 2. There would appear to be no add advantage in ineasing the concantrations still further since it might be expected that the constituents would crystalise out on the scalp, becoming a powder.Having regard for the known mechanism of action of steroids and probehly other hormones cyclic AMP, ATP and other normally intra cellular enzymes e.g. cyclic sMP could be added to the fornulation without impairing the effect or causing side effects and may dcce e added benefit in oertain subjects. The concentrations of cyclic AMP and ATP were also maximal to produce a super saturated solution at room temperature.It was possible to add a vasodilator preparation, Phentolamin Mesylate to a concentration of 0.048 0.18 and probably higher. This preparation is a well recognised alpha adrenergic blocker which may be expected to cause dilatation of peripheral capillaries in the scalp thereby increasing the blood supply to the hair follicle. When similar preparations are applied in solution in propylene glycol, industrial methylated spirit and water or inUngentum Merck at 1 concentration as Minoxidil, hair growth can be achieved in patients with alopecia areata see Topical Minoxidil in the Treatment of Alopecia Areata. Fenton D A, Wilkinson J D.British Medical Joanmal 287, 1015 1017 . I propose that the combination of the topical antiandrogen preparation with an alpha adrenergic receptor blocker or other vasodilator may enhance scalp hair growth in common baldness and also in alopecia areata by diminishing any additional inhibitory effects on hair growth by the common baldness process coexisting with alopecia areata. Three female patients with alopecia areata progressing to alopecia totalis capitis whom I have treated previously with cyclical antiandrogen theraEy as Cyproterone Acetate 50mg daily for the first 10 days of each cycle.Ethinyloestradiol 40ug daily for 21 days of each cycle shed within 2 4 months the growth of fine downy hair over the scalp. m bsequently, this fell only to region again in six months. One patient had continued with treatment for 18 months and was growing terminal hair.Therefore, suppression of androgenic effects of endogenous boriraes may potentiate the response to vasodilator substances.Thus 3.the combination of topical antiandrogen thereapy with topical alpha adrenergic receptor blocker or other vasodilator may produce an addition beneficial effect on scalp hair growth in common baldness as well as alopecia areats totalis universalis.4. The combination of topical antiandrogen therapy as described with other known antiandrogens e.g. cimetadine, azelaic acid given topically or systemically, or with anabolic growth promoting substances e.g. growth hormone, may produce an additional beneficial effect on scalp hair growth in common baldness.5. TopicaL antiandrogen therapy may be expected to produce increased hair growth rate and or density and or fibre thickness in apparently normal subjects and may be useful in the treatment of other conditions in which hair loss occurs e.g. following general viral, bacterial illness, post pregnancy, pre , peri , post menopausal women, post irradiation post cytotoxic therapy, malnutrition, parasitic infections, metabolic disorders, infective conditions, following bums, physical or chemical injury to the scaop or in other conditions in which hair loss occurs. 6. local antiandrogen thery may be used in patients with greasy hair and irritating scalp conditions and to improve the condition and appearance of existing hair.7. Tcpical antiandrogen therapy may be in used in both rape and female patients. Table 1.

It will be appreciated, therefore, that it is not necessary to administer all three agents by the same route.Thus, for example, the thyroid hormone could be taken orally as a tablet, whilst the oestrogen and the non oestrogenic anti androgen could be applied topically as a lotion. Clearly, however, the oestrogen would normally not be administered to a male patient via the systemic route, because of adverse side effects. Accordingly the present invention further provides a pack for a combination of pharmaceutical compositions for promoting scalp hair growth, which pack comprises at least one composition for systemic application and at least one composition for topical application, wherein each composition contains individually as ingredients a thyroid hormone, an oestrogen, a non oestrogenic anti androgen, or a mixture thereof, with the proviso that all three ingredients are present within the pack. Also within the scope of the invention is the use of a combination of topical and systemic pharmaceutical compositions for promoting scalp hair growth wherein the combination includes as ingredients a thyroid hormone, an oestrogen and a non oestrogenic anti androgen.
