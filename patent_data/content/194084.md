# Electrochemical assay for cis diols.

## Abstract
The invention disclosed relates to an electrochemical as say which is particularly concerned with an assay for the presence of, or amount of, glycosylated haemoglobin in a blood sample, but which extends a general assay for detecting the presence of, monitoring the level of or determining the con centration of compounds containing cis diol groups, such as glycols, nucleic acid components, sugars, polyols, catechols and glycosylated proteins. When ferrocene boronic acid or a derivative thereof is present free in solution, it can act as a mediator for a wide range of oxido reductases. However in the presence of, for example, sugars containing the cis diol structure, the metallocine such as ferrocene boronic acid covalently binds to the sugar. When the ferrocene boronic acid is thus bound, it is essentially im mobilized and its properties as a mediator and ability to diffuse will be markedly affected.
