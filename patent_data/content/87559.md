# Thin film permanent magnet.

## Abstract
A thin film permanent magnet which is made of a Co Pt alloy containing 5 35 atomic of Pt. This thin film permanent magnet can be readily produced by a sputtering method in which the ultimate pressure before the introduc tion of a sputtering gas is made 5 10 ⁷ 1 10 ⁴ Torr. Without any heat treatment, it has a coercivity of 2,000 Oe at the maximum and a remanence of about 8,000 about 18,000 G.
