# STARCH FOR THE USE IN DUSTING POWDERS

## Abstract
A dusting powder composition containing porous starch granules is prepared by treating granular starch with an alpha amylase enzyme. The enzyme treatment is carried out under conditions which solubilize a portion of the starch while leaving a porous granular starch residue.
