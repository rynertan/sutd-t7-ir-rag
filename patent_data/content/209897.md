## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONPEPTIDE ENZYME INHIBITOR8BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of The Invention The present invention is concerned with novel peptides which inhibit renin, some peptides of which also inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme A.C.E. . The present invention is also concerned with pharmaceutical compositions containing the novel peptides of the present invention as active ingredients, with methods of treating renin associated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism, with treating congestive heart failure, with diagnostic methods which utilize the novel peptides of the present invention, and with methods of preparing the novel peptides of the present invention. Renin is a proteolytic enzyme of molecular weight about 40,000, produced and secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney. Renin acts on the plasma substrate, angiotensinogen, to split off the decapeptide angiotensin I, which is converted to the potent pressor agent angiotensin II. Thus, the renin angiotensin system plays an important role in normal cardiovascular homeostasis and in some forms of hypertension. In the past, attempts to modulate or manipulate the renin angiotensin system have met with success in the use of inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme. In view of this success, it was concluded that a specific inhibitor of the limiting enzymatic step that ultimately regulates angiotensinII production, the action of renin on its substrate, would be at least equally successful. Thus, an effective inhibitor of renin has been long sought as both a therapeutic agent and as an investigative tool.2. Brief Descrintion of the Prior Art There has been substantial interest in the synthesis of useful renin inhibitors for many decades and the following table lists the major classes of renin inhibitors that have been studied, as well as their relative inhibition constants K. ClassRenin antibody probably 10 6Pepstatin leo 6 10 Phospholipids 10 3Substrate analogs Tetrapeptides 10 3 Octa to tridecapeptides 10 5 10 6 Umezawa fl awl., in J. Antibiot. Tokyo 23 259 262, 1970, reported the isolation of a peptide, known as pepstatin, from actinomyces that was an inhibitor of aspartyl proteases such as pepsin, cathepsin D, and renin.Pepstatin, the structure of which isEMI3.1 was subsequently found by Gross fl li.. in Science 175 656, 1971, to reduce blood pressure in vivo after the injection of hog renin into nephrectomized rats, bit it has not found wide application as an experimental agent because of its limited solubility and its additional inhibition of a variety of other acid proteases in addition to renin. To date, many efforts have been made to prepare a specific renin inhibitor based on substrate analogy, with this analogy generally being based on the known pig renin substitute, since since the human renin substrate has only recently been elucidated Tewksbury et al., Circulation 59, 60, Supp. II 132,Oct. 1979 , This substrate analogy based on pig renin has always been considered acceptable in the art as predictive of human renin inhibitory activity because of the closely related activity of the two renins, even though the human and pig substrates are not the same. Thus, while pig renin does not cleave the human renin substrate, human renin, on the other hand, does cleave the pig renin substrate. See Poulsen et al.,Biochim. B ophys. Acta 452 533 537, 1976 and Skeggs,Jr. et al., J. Exp. Med. 106 439 453, 1957.Moreover, the human renin inhibitory activity of the peptides of the present invention most active in inhibiting pig renin has been confirmed, thus providing further evidence of this accepted correlation between human and pig renin activity. It has been found, for example, using pig renin substrate analogy, that the octapeptide sequence extending from histidine 6 through tyrosine 13 has kinetic parameters essentially the same as those of the full tetradecapeptide renin substrate. The amino acid sequence of the octapeptide in pig renin substrate is as follows 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 His Pro Phe His Leu Leu Val TyrRenin cleaves this substrate between Leulo and Leu Kokubu et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22 3217 3223, 1973, synthesized a number of analogs of the tetrapeptide found between residues 10 to 13, but while inhibition could be shown, inhibitory constants were only of the order of 10 M. Analogs of a larger segment of renin substrate were also synthesized Burton et al.,BiochemistrY 14 3892 3898, 1975, and Poulsen et al.,Biochemistry 12 3877 3882, 1973. Two of the major obstacles which had to be overcome to obtain an effective renin inhibitor useful in vivo were lack of solubility and weak binding large inhibitory constant . Modifications to increase solubility soon established that the inhibitory properties of the peptides are markedly dependent on the hydrophobicity of various amino acid residues, and that increasing solubility by replacing lipophilic amino acids with hydrophilic isosteric residues becomes counterproductive. Other approaches to increasing solubility have had limited success. Various modifications designed to increase binding to renin have also been made, but here too, with only limited success.For a more detailed description of past efforts to prepare an effective inhibitor of renin, see Haber and Burton,Fed. Proc. Fed. Am. Soc. Exp. Biol. 38 2768 2773, 1979. More recently, Szelke et al., in work described in European Patent Publication No. 45,665 Nature. 299, 555 1982 Hypertension, q, Supp. 2, 59, 1981 British Patent No. 1,587,809 and NovelTransition State Analogue Inhibitors of Renin , a presentation at the Eighth American Peptide Symposium,May 22 27, 1983, Tucson, Arizona, have replaced theLeu Leu site of renin cleavage by isosteric substitution, and obtained compounds with excellent potency. Powers et al., in Acid Proteases. Structure,Function and Biology, Plenum Press, 1977, 141 157 have suggested that in pepstatin, statine occupies the space of the two amino acids on either side of the cleavage site of a pepsin substrate, and Tang et al., in Trends in Biochem. Sci., 1 205 208 1976 and J. Biol. Chem., 251 7088 94, 1976, have proposed that the statine residue of pepstatin rasembles the transition state for pepsin hydrolysis of peptide bonds.However, the applicability of these concepts to renin inhibitors is not taught in any of these references, and would be speculative due to the known high degree of specificity of the renin enzyme. Kokubu metal., Biochem. Biophos, Res. Comm.118 929 933, 1984 and Fehrentz et al., FEBS Letters 167 273 276, 1984, have prepared a renin inhibitor in which a C terminal aldehyde is used to mimic Leul0 of the substrate. However, there is no suggestion of the renin inhibitors of the present invention in which statine and other moieties replace lieu10 lieu11 of the substrate. Veber and Rich, in U.S. Patent No. 4,384,994 and published European Patent Application No. 0,077,029 Evans and Rittle, in U.S. Patent No.4,397,786 Veber and Boger, in published EuropeanPatent Application No. 0,077,028 Boger et al, Nature, 303 81 84 1983 have all described renin inhibitory peptides containing statine and in Nature there is further described renin inhibitors having a shortenedC terminus, with a non peptide ending after the ll position. However, none of these references describe or suggest the renin inhibitors of the present invention and the significant increase in renin inhibitory activity obtainable therewith.Moreover, the Nature reference teaches away from renin inhibitors having non peptide components after the ll position, as with the inhibitors of the present invention.

The inhibitory peptides of the present invention may be better appreciated in terms of substrate analogy from the following illustration of Formula I alongside the octapeptide sequence of a portion of the piq renin substrate, which renin cleaves betweenLeu10 and Leu11 Pro Phe His Leu Leu Val Tyr 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 EMI66.1 As can be seen, a unique aspect and essential feature of the present invention is the substitution of the G component for the double amino acid sequence Leul0 Leull in the endogenous pig renin substrate. It is believed that substitution of this component for both leucine amino acids rather than just one leucine results in an improved substrate analogy due to the greater linear extent of the component as compared to a single leucine component. Thus, the component more closely approximates Leu Leu in linear extent, and thereby provides a better fit to the renin enzyme.

It is believed that substitution of this component for both the leucine and valine amino acids rather than just the leucine results in an improved substrate analogy due to the greater linear extent of the component as compared to a single leucine component.Thus, the component more closely approximates Leu Val in linear extent, and thereby provides a better fit to the human renin enzyme. The Formula I compounds can be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids and bases. Included among such acid addition salts are the following acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsuif ate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2 hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2 naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3 phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thio cyanate, tosylate, and undecanoate.Base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine salts,N methyl D glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and so forth.

aminophylline cryptenamine acetates and tannates deserpidine meremethoxylline procaine pargyline trimethaphan camsylate and the like, as well as admixtures and combinations thereof. Typically, the individual daily dosages for these combinations can range from about one fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly. Coadministration is most readily accomplished by combining the active ingredients into a suitable unit dosage form containing the proper dosages of each. Other methods of coadministration are, of course, possible. The novel peptides of the present invention possess an excellent degree of activity in treating renin associated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism.Some of the peptides also have ACE inhibitor activity which may also make them useful for treating hypertension and congestive heart failure. For these purposes the compounds of the present invention may be administered parenterally, by inhalation spray, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warm blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, dogs, cats, etc., the compounds of the invention are effective in the treatment of humans. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectibles. The peptides of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Dosage levels of the order of 0.1 to 4.0 grams per day are useful in the treatment of the above indicated conditions. For example, reninassociated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism are effectively treated by the administration of from 1.0 to 50 milligrams of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. Thus, in accordance with the present invention there is further provided a pharmaceutical composition for treating renin associated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism, or congestive heart failure comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of the formula EMI78.1 wherein A, B, D, E, R1, G, and J have the same meaning as recited further above for Formula I wherein all of the asymmetric carbon atoms have an fi configuration, except for those in the B, D, and G substituents, which may have an fi or R configuration and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Also, in accordance with the present invention there is still further provided a method of treating renin associated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism, comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment, a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of the formula EMI79.1 wherein A, B, D, E, R1, G, and J have the same meaning as recited further above for Formula I wherein all of the asymmetric carbon atoms have an fi configuration, except for those in the A, D, and G substituents, which may have an fi or R configuration and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The renin inhibitory novel peptides of the present invention may also be utilized in diagnostic methods for the purpose of establishing the significance of renin as a causative or contributory factor in hypertension or hyperaldosteronism in a particular patient. For this purpose the novel peptides of the present invention may be administered in a single dose of from 0.1 to 10 mg per kg of body weight. Both in vivo and in vitro methods may be employed. In the in vivo method, a novel peptide of the present invention is administered to a patient, preferably by intravenous injection, although parenteral administration is also suitable, at a hypotensive dosage level and as a single dose, and there may result a transitory fall in blood pressure. This fall in blood pressure, if it occurs, indicates supranormal plasma renin levels. An in vitro method which may be employed involves incubating a body fluid, preferably plasma, with a novel peptide of the present invention and, after deproteinization, measuring the amount of angiotensin II produced in nephrectomized, pentolinium treated rats. Another in vitro method involves mixing the plasma or other body fluid with a novel peptide of the present invention and injecting the mixture into a test animal. The difference in pressor response with and without added peptide is a measure of the renin content of the plasma. Pepstatin may be employed in the methods described above as an active control. See, e.g.,U.S. Patent Nos. 3,784,686 and 3,873,681 for a description of the use of pepstatin in diagnostic methods of this type. The novel peptides of the present invention may be prepared in accordance with well known procedures for preparing peptides from their constituent amino acids, which will be described in more detail below. A general method of preparation may be described in the following terms A method of preparing a peptide of FormulaI, said peptide being comprised of from two to six amino acids identified as I through VI, amino acid AA I being the component G at the C terminus of said peptide, and amino acid AA VI being at the N terminus of said peptide, to which substituent A is attached, comprising the steps of A treating the desired ester or amide of the C terminus amino acid AA I with the next adjacent amino acid AA II of said peptide, the amino group of said amino acid being protected by a protecting group, in the presence of a condensing agent, whereby a dipeptide of the two amino acids AA I and II is formed B deprotecting the dipeptide formed in Step A by removing the protecting group from the amino group of AA II, to give the peptide of Formula I wherein A is hydrogen C treating the dipeptide formed in Step B where an ester of AAI is employed with hydrazine to give the corresponding hydrazide, followed by treatment of said hydrazide with acidic nitrite to give the corresponding acyl azide, followed by treatment of said acyl azide with the appropriate amine compound to give the desired J substituent in the peptide of Formula I and optionally D treating the dipeptide formed in Step C withEMI81.1 2 2 where X, Ra, and Rbl are as defined above and W is an acid halide, anhydride, or other carbonyl activating group, to give the peptide of Formula I wherein A is other than hydrogen and optionally E forming a tripeptide up to a hexapeptide of AA I, through AA VI, by repeating the procedures of Steps A and B using protected AA III through protected AA VI F deprotecting the tripeptide through hexapeptide formed in Step E to give the peptide of Formula I wherein A is hydrogen and optionally G treating the ttipeptide through hexapeptide formed in Step H withEMI82.1 2 where X, R , and Rb are as defined above and W is an acid halide, anhydride, or other carboxyl activating group, to give the peptide of Formula I wherein A is other than hydrogen said method also comprising, where necessary, protection of sidechain substituents of the component amino acids AA I through AA VI, with deprotection being carried out as a final step said method also comprising any combination of the steps set out above, whereby the amino acids I through VI and substituents A, G, and J, are assembled in any desired order to prepare the peptide of Formula I and said method also comprising employment of the steps set out above in a solid phase sequential synthesis, whereby in the initial step the carboxyl group of the selected amino acid is bound to a synthetic resin substrate while the amino group of said amino acid is protected, followed by removal of the protecting group, the succeeding steps being as set out above, the peptide as it is assembled being attached to said synthetic resin substrate followed by a step of removing the peptide of Formula I from said synthetic resin substrate and after removal of the peptide of Formula I from said synthetic resin substrate, the step of teating said ester thereof in accordance with the procedures described in Step C above to give the desired J substituent in the peptide of Formula I removal of sidechain protecting groups being accomplished either before or after removal of the peptide of Formula I from said synthetic resin substrate. Preparation of the peptides of Formula I having the desired J substituent, as described above in Step C , may be illustrated as follows for the particular case where J benzylamide and PEP represents the remaining portion of the peptide ofFormula I EMI83.1 The G ComponentI. Where the Component G Is a Pentide Isotere the novel peptides of the present invention may be prepared in accordance with well known procedures in synthetic chemistry, as is described in more detail further below. Attachment of the isostere componentG to the other components of the novel peptides of the present invention is carried out in the same manner as for any of said other components, and may involve addition of the isostere component in a protected form.For example, the following reactive groups would require such protection EMI84.1 asEMI84.2 andEMI84.3 asEMI84.4 Such protecting groups may be removed as a final or near final step, for example, by base hydrolysis in the former case, or by hydrogenation in the latter.

Where the Component G Is a 2 Substituted Statine an efficient method of preparing the 2 substituted statine component G in the required 2E,3E,4E configuration begins with the preparation of protected phenylalanine aldehyde 1 in three steps beginning from phenylalanine, illustrated as follows EMI97.1 tb SEP SOCl2 SEP H2 tb Phe OH SEP SEP PhTh Phe OH SEP SEP SEP Phth Phe CHO tb SEP 1 tb This aldehyde 1 can then be reacted with the ketone silylacetal 2 in a titanium mediated aldol condensation to afford an approximately 1 1 mixture of 3a and 3b, illustrated as follows EMI97.2 Diasterioselectivity favors by 95 formation of the li isomer, and the two diastereomers are thus readily separated by chromatography. The configurations of the chiral centers can be established as follows treatment of the phthalimido methyl esters 3a and 3b with excess hydrazine gives the respective amino acyl hydrazides 4a and 4b, which are then converted in a two step one pot procedure to the corresponding lactams Lss and Sk, to which stereochemical assignments can be made based onPMR analysis.These reactions may be illustrated as follows EMI98.1 Alternatively, the benzyl ester i, rather than the methyl ester, may be used to form the ketone silylacetal 2, which can then be reacted with phthalyl phenylalanine aldehyde and phthalyl leucine aldehyde, for example, to give t and Ek, illustrated as follows EMI99.1 EMI99.2 2S, 3R, 4S isomer Separation of the isomers followed by hydrogenation gives a protected 2 substituted statine component which can be used to prepare peptides ofFormula I in accordance with well known methods of peptide synthesis.

The phenyl analog of statine 36,46 4amino 3 hydroxy 5 phenylpentanoic acid AHPPA can be prepared in accordance with the procedure described by Rich et al., J. Med. Chem. 23 27 33 1980 . The cyclohexylalanine analog of statine, 3S,4S 4 amino 5 cyclohexyl 3 hydrosypentanoic acid ACHPA can be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation using H2 Rh on alumina, or other sutiable catalyst of the BOC AHPPA, prepared as described in the paragraph immediately above. Alternatively, this and similar statine analogs can be prepared in accordance with the procedure described for statine, where the BOC Leu starting material is replaced with the amino acid containing the desired side chain. Thus, BOC ACHPA can also be prepared starting fromBOC L cyclohexylalanine, itself prepared, for example, by catalytic reduction of BOC Phe, in the same manner as described for BOC AHPPA.

The resin is composed of fine beads 20 70 microns in diameter of a synthetic resin prepared by copolymerization of styrene with 1 2 percent divinylbenzene.The benzene rings in the resin are chloromethylated in a Friedel Crafts reaction with chloromethyl methyl ether and stannic chloride. The Friedel Crafts reaction is continued until the resin contains 0.5 to 5 mmoles of chlorine per gram of resin. The amino acid selected to be the C terminal amino acid of the linear peptide is converted to its amino protected derivative. The carboxyl group of the selected C terminal amino acid is bound covalently to the insoluble polymeric resin support, as for example, as the carboxylic ester of the resin bonded benzyl chloride present in chloromethyl substituted polystyrene divinylbenzene resin. After the amino protecting group is removed, the amino protected derivative of the next amino acid in the sequence is added along with a coupling agent, suc h as dicyclo hexylcarbodiimide. The amino acid reactant may be employed in the form of a carboxyl sct Lvated amino acid such as ONP ester, an amino acid azidel and the like.Deprotection and addition of su,ccessive amino acids is performed until the desired linear peptide is formed. The selection of protecting groups is, in part, dictated by particular coupling conditions, in part by the amino acid and peptide components involved in the reaction. Amino protecting groups ordinarily employed include those which are well known in the art, for example, urethane protecting substituents such as benzyloxy carbonyl carbobenzoxy , p methoxycarbo benzoxy, p nitrocarbobenzoxy, t butyoxycarbonyl, and the like. It is preferred to utilize t butyloxy carbonyl BOC for protecting the amino group in the amino acids undergoing reaction at the carboxyl end of said amino acid. The BOC protecting group is readily removed following such coupling reaction and prior to the subsequent step by the relatively mild action of acids i.e. trifluoroacetic acid, or hydrogen chloride in ethyl acetate . The OH group of Thr and Ser can be protected by the Bzl group and the amino group of Lys can be protected by the INOC group or the 2 chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl 2 cl csz3 group. Neither group is affected by TFA, used for removing BOC protecting groups.After the peptide is formed, the protective groups, such as 2 Cl CBZ and Bzl, can be removed by treatment with HF or by catalytic hydrogenation. After the peptide has been formed on the solid phase resin, it may be removed from the resin by a variety of methods which are well known in the art. For example the peptide may be cleaved from the resin with hydrazine, by ammonia in methanol, or by methanol plus a suitable base.

Typically, the individual daily dosages for these combinations can range from about one fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly. Coadministration is most readily accomplished by combining the active ingredients into a suitable unit dosage form containing the proper dosages of each. Other methods of coadministration are, of course, possible. The novel peptides of Formula I possess an excellent degree of activity in treating hypertension and congestive heart failure. The Formula I compounds also are expected to be orally active. For these purposes the compounds of Formula I may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warmblooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, dogs, cats, etc., the compounds of the invention are effective in the treatment of humans. The pharmaceutical compositions containingFormula IO peptides may be provided in oral dosage forms e.g. tablets, capsules, solutions, dispersions, etc., the oral formulations are prepared using conventional procedures and compounding ingredients e.g. carriers, diluents, etc. The compositions may also be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3 butanediol.Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic monoor diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectibles. The peptides of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Dosage levels of the order of 0.1 to 4.0 grams per day parenterally are useful in the treatment of the above indicated conditions. Oral doss may be 3 10 times bigher. For example, reninassociated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism are effectively treated parenterally by the administration of from 1.0 to 50 milligrams of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. Thus, in accordance with the present invention there is further provided a pharmaceutical composition for treating hypertension and congestive heart failure, comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of the Formula 10. Also, in accordance with the present invention there is still further provided a method of treating hypertension and congestive heart failure, comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment, a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of the Formula IO. The renin inhibitory peptides of Formula IO may also be utilized in diagnostic methods for the purpose of establishing the significance of renin as a causative or contributory factor in hypertension or congestive heart failure in a particular patient.For this purpose these peptides may be administered in a single dose of from 0.1 to 10 mg per kg of body weight. Both in vivo and in vitro methods may be employed. In the in vivo method, a novel peptide of the present invention is administered to a patient, preferably by intravenous injection, although other routes of parenteral administration are also suitable, at a hypotensive dosage level and as a single dose, and there may result a transitory fall in blood pressure. This fall in blood pressure, if it occurs, indicates supranormal plasma renin levels. Some of the peptides of Formula I, particularly those of Formula I also have angiotensin converting enzyma ACE inhibitor activity. This activity augments renin inhibition in lowering blood pressure and in treating congestive heart failure. The compounds of the present invention, as characterized by Formula I , may be viewed as a peptide segment A B D linked through an amide bond to a phosphorus containing component designated asE . The preparation of these compounds is illustrated in the examples below and in general proceeds as follows 1. a Coupling of an amino protected form of D0 toE , followed by b amino protecting group removal from D E and c coupling A B to the resulting amino group of D E . Or 2. Coupling of A B , prepared by known techniques as illustrated in the examples qhich follow, to E by known coupling procedures. The phosphorus containing component E , as well as the amino acid side chains of be and D may contain functionality which requiren protection during the coupling reactions. Protecting groups, among those well known in peptide synthesis, are chosen so as to be compatible with the coupling steps, yet easily removable afterwards. Among those utilized for amino group protection are the t butoxycarbonyl BOC , benzyloxycarbonyl CBZ , 9 f luorenylmethyloxycarbonyl FMOC , and benzyl groups. Carboxylic acids are protected as the methyl, ethyl, benzyl, or t butyl esters. Phosphonic and phosphinic acids are protected as the methyl or ethyl esters.The peptide coupling procedures referred to above include those brought about by use of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 1 hydroxybenzotriazole and of disuccinimido oxallate K. Takeda et al.,Tetrahedron Lett., 26, 4451 54 1983 . In many cases, both carboxylic and phosphonic or phosphinic esters may be hydrolyzed along with amino protecting groups as the last step in the synthesis. In these cases, treatment of the phosphorus containing peptide analog with 30 hydrobromic acid in acetic acid, with 6N hydrochloric acid, or with aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by purification of the resulting deprotected material by ion exchange chromatography or reverse phase HPLC, provides the desired product.In instances where the phosphorus containing component E possesses a carboxyl terminal amide function, the fully coupled material A Be D E may be treated with 1 equivalent of lithium hydroxide 0.1 N to hydrolyze selectively an ester function in E . Standard coupling procedures may then be used to couple the resulting free carboxylic acid to an appropriate amine. This is followed by removal of the remaining protecting groups as described above. Alternatively the amide formation may be carried out prior to coupling of the component E to the A B D0 unit. Preparation of the phosphorus containing components E are carried out as illustrated in the examples to follow. The l aminoalkylphosphonous acids used as starting materials in the examples below are prepared as illustrated in the examples and can be resolved to give optically active materials by the method of Baylis fl J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans 1, 2845 53 1984 . Compounds derived from both the optically active and racemic materials are claimed in the present invention. The l aminoalkylphosphonic acids used in the examples below are prepared as described and can be resolved to give the optically active materials by the procedure of Kafarski et al., Can. J. Chem., 60, 3081 84 1982 , or can be prepared in optically active form by the method of Huber et al.,Tetrahedron Lett., 3049 3052 1979 . Compounds derived from both the optically active and racemic materials are claimed in the present invention. When the B or D units are N methyl amino acids, or when the amino group of the unit E which is to be coupled to A Be D bears an N methyl group R6 CH3 , procedures well known in peptide synthesis are used to prepare the A B D segments and to couple this unit to E or E Ge. In general, the mixed anhydride procedure with pivaloyl chloride and N methylmorpholine is used, as illustrated by R.M. Wenger, Helv. Chem. Acts., 1984, 67, 502 525.N methyl amino acids can be prepared by the method ofM. J. O Donnell at al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1984, 25, 3651.
