# The manufacture of a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor layer, of polycrystalline silicon, 67 is provided on a substrate 61 . The layer 67 contains an impur ity, for example phosphorus. The layer 67 is irradiated with a high energy laser beam, the layer 67 and part of the subs trate 61 are melted by the high energy beam and impurity diffuses from the layer 67 into the substrate 61 to form impurity diffusion regions 69 and 70 where the layer 67 contacts the substrate 61 . The melted semiconductor layer is single crystallised and can be used to form contact electrodes of low resistance for the impurity diffusion regions 69 and 70 .
