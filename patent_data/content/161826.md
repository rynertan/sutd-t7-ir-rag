# SINGLE MODE OPTICAL FIBRE ATTENUATORS

## Abstract
A single mode optical fibre preset attenuator is made by forming a fusion splice 2 between a length of silica fibre possessing no internal waveguiding structure to a length 1 of single mode optical fibre. Then the silica fibre is cut to a predetermined length to form a short stub 3 which is fusion spliced to a second length 4 of single mode fibre. The fusion splicing equipment may subsequently be used to heat soften the central region of the stub to enable it to be shortened or lengthened to fine tune the attenuation provided.
