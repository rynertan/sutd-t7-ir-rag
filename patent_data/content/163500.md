# IMPROVEMENTS IN LIQUID LEVEL INDICATORS FOR VEHICLE HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A liquid level indicator 1 for a vehicle hydraulic system is mounted in a reservoir 2 and comprises a float operated switch 5 which completes an electrical circuit when the liquid in the reservoir 2 is below a predetermined level to energise indicating means, and manually operable means 10 for operating the switch to test the circuit. The switch 5 has a contact 6 carried by the float 7 , upward movement of which is limited by retaining means 19 , and contact 8 carried from the reservoir 2 by a member 20 movable relative to the reservoir 2 . The manually operable means 10 is an end cap 32 which in a rest position keeps the reservoir contact 8 stationary while the float contact 6 is movable. For testing, the end cap 32 is unscrewed, allowing the reservoir contact 8 to move into engagement with the float contact 6 , which is held stationary by the retaining means 19 . A seal 30 and spring 31 bias the member 20 away from the reservoir 2 .
