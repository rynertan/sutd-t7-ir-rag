# Hydrocarbon soluble dialkyl magnesium compositions of high magnesium content, production thereof and hydrocarbon solutions thereof.

## Abstract
A composition of matter is disclosed comprising dimethylmagnesium, di n propylmagnesium and optionally diethylmagnesium. The composition is soluble in aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents without the aid of solubilizing agents. The composition is prepared in the substantial absence of oxygen and moisture by the simultaneous or consecutive reactions of methyl, ethyl, and n propyl halides with metallic magnesium in the presence of the hydrocarbon solvent, followed by separation of the insoluble magnesium halide and any unreacted magnesium metal from the resulting solution. The compositions are useful in providing dialkyl magnesium compounds of high magnesium content which are soluble in hydrocarbons.
