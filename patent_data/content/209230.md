In the following discussion, reagents and reaction conditions are given by way of illustration. Compounds of Formula I, wherein E is CH₂ or a single bond, can be synthesized by one or more of the procedures outlined in Equation 1. The reaction of Equation 1a can be carried out according to procedures described in U.S. 4,127,405. The sulfonyl isocyanates II are prepared from the corresponding sulfonamides of Formula IV according to procedures described in United States Patent 4,238,621 or by the procedure of H. Ulrich, B. Tucker, and A. Sayigh, Sulfonyl isothiocyanates II, W is S are known in the art and are prepared from the corresponding sulfonamides IV by reaction with carbon disulfide and potassium hydroxide followed by treatment of the resulting dipotassium salt VI with phosgene. Such a procedure is described in Alternatively compounds of Formula I can be pre pared according to Equation 1b or by the reaction of Equation 1c as described in United States Patent 4,443,243. The sulfonylureas of Formula I, wherein E is O, can be prepared by one or both of the procedures described in Equation 2. Phenols of Formula VII react with chlorsulfonyl isocyanate CSI under elevated temperatures Equation 2a to provide the sulfonyl isocyanates II, which react with heterocyclic amines of Formula III to yield the sulfonylureas I according to the procedure in United States Patent 4,475,944. Alternatively, the reaction of Equation 2b may be employed according to the pro cedure described in United States Patent 4,391,976. Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds of Formula I are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by contacting com pounds of Formula I with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g., hydroxide, alkoxide or carbonate . Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be pre pared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct contact of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., alkali or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble, e.g., a potassium, sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I with a suitable acid, e.g., p toluenesulfonic acid, trichloroacetic acid or the like. The synthesis of heterocyclic amines such as those represented by Formula III has been reviewed in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, a series published by Interscience Publ., New York and London. Aminopyrimidines are described by D. J. Brown in The Pyrimidines, Vol. XVI of the series mentioned above which is herein incorporated by reference. The 2 amino 1,3,5 triazines of Formula III, where A is A 1 and Z is N, can be prepared according to methods described by E. M. Smolin and L. Rapaport in s Triazines and Derivatives, Vol. XIII. Pyrimidines of Formula III, where A is A 1 and Y is an acetal or thioacetal substituent, can be prepared by methods taught in European Patent Applica tion No. 84,224 published July 27, 1983 . Pyrimidines of Formula III, where A is A 1 and Y is cyclopropyl or OCF₂H can be synthesized according to the methods taught in United States Patent 4,515,626 and United States Patent 4,540,782, respectively. Compounds of Formula III, where A is A 2 or A 3, can be prepared by procedures disclosed in United States Patent 4,339,267. Compounds of Formula III, where A is A 4, can be prepared by methods taught in United States Patent 4,487,626. Additional references dealing with the synthesis of bicyclic pyrimidines of Formula III, where A is A 2, A 3, or A 4 are Braker, Sheehan, Spitzmiller and Lott, Compounds of Formula III, where A is A 5, can be prepared by methods taught in United States Patent 4,421,550. Compounds of Formula III, where A is A 6, can be prepared by methods taught in the United States Patent 4,496,392. The required sulfonamides of Formula IV, pro vided E is not oxygen, can be conveniently prepared by amination of the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides with ammonia or ammonium hydroxide by methods known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively deprotection of N t butylsulfonamides with polyphosphoric acid PPA or trifluoroacetic acid TFA as described by J. D Lombardino, In addition, deprotection of N t butyldimethyl silylsulfonamides with fluoride ion, provides sulfon amides of Formula IV, wherein E is not oxygen. The intermediate sulfonyl chlorides of Formula X, as depicted in Equation 3, can be prepared from aroma tic amines via a diazotization process, as described in EPO Publication Nos. 83,975 and 85,476 or by oxidative chlorination of thiols or thioethers with chlorine and water as reviewed in Gilbert, Sulfona tion and Related Reactions, pp. 202 214, Interscience Publishers, New York, 1965 when R₇ H or benzyl, the oxidative chlorination may be effected by sodium hypochlorite following procedures described by L. H. McKendry and N. R. Pearson in South African Patent Application No. 84 8845 November 13, 1984 or by metal halogen exchange or directed lithiation of appropriately substituted aryl or heterocyclic sub strates followed by trapping with sulfuryl chloride. The lithiation can be performed according to the procedure of S. H. Bhattacharya, et al., Amines of the Formula IX, wherein G is NH₂, can be prepared from the corresponding nitro compounds by various reduction procedures as described in United States Patents 3,846,440 and 3,846,439 and in EP A No. 83,975 and references cited therein. Phenols of Formula VII can be prepared from amines of Formula IX G NH₂ via a diazotization pro cess, as described in A. I. Vogel, Practical Organic Chemistry, P. 595 1956 , 3rd Ed U.S. 3,270,029 J. H. Finley, et al., Compounds of the Formula XII, which serve as intermediates to compounds of the Formula I, wherein Q is E₁X The ten procedures are based on established literature methods precedented by the references cited in Table 2. The references cited have direct applica bility to compounds of the Formula XII, wherein J is J 1. However, the procedures and experimental methods described in these references are equally applicable to the synthesis of compounds of Formula XII, wherein J is J 2 through J 5, by analogous procedures or slight modifications thereof. The chemistry of the thiophene, pyridine and pyrazole ring systems has been reviewed in Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, Volumes 3, 14, and 5, respectively, Wiley, New York 1952 and later. It should be noted that the chemical compati bility of the wide variety of reactions and reaction conditions described throughout this disclosure with J, R₁, Q₂, and G must be taken into account and as such requires a judicious choice of the appropriate methods for preparing compounds described within this disclosure. In addition, circumvention of instances of incompatibility may be achieved by the suitable selection of a protecting group, obvious to one skilled in the art. For a compilation of references describing the wide variety of protecting groups available, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1981. The synthesis of the starting materials of Formula XI are known in the general literature or can be prepared, by those skilled in the art, by simple modifications of established routes. Table 2 sumarizes selected synthetic procedures viable for the synthesis of compounds of Formula XII. Table 2 is not meant to be all inclusive, but does provide synthetic routes, which are well established and precedented in the literature, through the known chemical procedures 1 10 , conversions A L , and methods described in the references 1 84 or slight modifications thereof. For example, the preparation of a compound of Formula The preparation of the compounds of Formula I, wherein Q is E₁X To a solution of 1.35 g of potassium tert butoxide in 25 mL of dimethylformamide, cooled to 0 C, was added 0.92 mL of 2 pyrrolidinone. As a white precipitate formed, the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes, and 3.0 g of 2 phenylmethylthio chloromethyl benzene was added in one portion. The resulting solution was allowed to warm to room temperature, stirred for 1 hour, poured into water, and extracted with methylene chloride. The organic layer was washed well with water, dried over magnesium sulfate, fil tered, and the filtrate evaporated to leave 3.0 g of a yellow oil. To a solution of 2.6 g of the compound of Example 1 dissolved in 100 mL of acetic acid, containing 0.5 mL of water, and cooled to 15 C, was bubbled in chlorine gas for 15 minutes. A slight exotherm of 5 C was noted. The reaction was stirred for an additional 5 minutes, poured into ice water, and extracted with methylene chloride. The organic layer was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated to an oil. The oil was immediately dissolved in 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran and treated with 2 mL of concentrated ammonium hydroxide and stirred for 1 hour. The tetrahydrofuran was removed on the rotary evaporator to give a semisolid. The residue was then triturated with water to form a sticky solid which was filtered off and triturated with ether to provide 1.1g of an off white solid m.p. 149 151 C. IR Nujol 1660 C O cm ¹ To a suspension of 254 mg of the product of Example 2 in 10 mL of acetonitrile, containing 275 mg of phenyl 4,6 dimethoxypyrimidin 2 yl carbamate, was added 0.15 mL of 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene DBU . The resultant solution was stirred for 2 hours, diluted with 20 mL of water and acidified with 5 drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Using the techniques described in Equations 1 4 and the synthetic routes summarized in Table 2, which makes use of 10 literature based synthetic procedures and the conversion procedures in Table 1, the follow ing compounds in Tables A, J and Q may be prepared by one skilled in the art. For purposes of expediency and avoidance of voluminous pages of tables each sulfonylurea is divided into three structural pieces as illustrated below. Each structural piece A, J, and Q is fully defined separately in Tables A, J and Q respectively and requires the designation of a particular structure from one of the structure s assigned to each of these tables. Thus to fully delineate a complete structure for a unique sulfonylurea it requires the information from one entry in each of the tables A, J, and Q and a designation of one of the structures assigned to that table. Note that only one structure, namely structure A, is assigned to Table A and need not be specifically designated. The use of Tables A, J, and Q provides an alternative to listing individual compounds line by line as is done in a conventional table. It is the applicant s intent to specifically disclose each and every compound that can be constructed from Tables A, J and Q using the procedure described above and illustrated below. The use of Tables A, J, and Q can be illustrated by the following. For example, specifically claimed is compound of Formula XIII and is Also specifically claimed is compound of formula XIV shown below. Compound of Formula XIV is found in Tables A, J, and Q as entry number four of Table A entry number one of Table J Structure B and entry number one of Table Q Structure J or in the convenient matrix form as 4 1 B 1 J By analogy compounds of Formula XV and XVI having structures as shown below The structures assigned to Tables A, J, and Q are shown below followed by Tables A, J, and Q and finally the melting point Table AJQ. Intermediate compounds used for preparing com pounds of Formula I, wherein Q is Q₁, may be prepared as described hereinafter. Sulfonamides of Formula IV, wherein J is J 1 to J 5, Q₁ is Q 20 and E is CH₂ or a single bond, may be prepared by reacting a corresponding sulfonamide, wherein Q₁ is NH₂, with β chloroethyl chloroformate followed by cyclization of the formed β chloroethyl carbamate with base such as sodium methoxide.

The reaction of The N alkylation reaction of Equation 5 is best carried out by reacting As shown in Equation 6, nitrocompounds of Formula XVII may be prepared by reaction of nitro compounds of Formula XV with the sodium or potassium salts of oxadiazolin 5 ones or thiadiazolin 5 ones of Formula The reaction of Equation 6 is best carried out using the analogous N alkylation procedures described above in Equation 5. For more details, refer to analogous reactions described in As shown in Equation 7 below, sulfonamides of Formula The cyclization reaction of Equation 7 is best carried out according to analogous procedures described in In a similar fashion to reactions described in Equations 5 and 7, sulfonamido thiophenes, pyrazoles and pyridines of Formula Also, In addition, as illustrated in Equation 8 below, thioethers of Formula The reaction of Equation 8 may be run according to analogous methods known in the art, or simple modifications thereof.

Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are some times desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook or Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey, but other solids, either mined or manufac tured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are de scribed in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Inter science, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution con centrates are preferably stable against phase separa tion at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encylopedia of Surface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of addi tives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbio logical growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning, Agglomeration , For further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example H. M.

The ingredients are ground together in a ball or roller mill until the solid particles have been reduced to diameters under 10 microns. The ingredients are blended and then ground in a hammermill to produce particles with an average particle size less than 25 microns in diameter. The material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening before being packaged. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled and then moistened with about 12 water. The mixture is extruded as cylinders about 3 mm diameter which are cut to produce pellets about 3 mm long. These may be used directly after drying, or the dried pellets may be crushed to pass a U.S.S. No. 20 sieve 0.84 mm openings . The granules held on a U.S.S. No. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings may be packaged for use and the fines recycled. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce a material essentially all passing a U.S.S. No. 50 screen 0.3 mm opening . The concentrate may then be formulated in a variety of ways. The ingredients are thoroughly blended. The liquid surfactant is added by spraying upon the solid ingredients in the blender. After grinding in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns, the material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening and packaged. The ingredients are blended, coarsely hammer milled and then air milled to produce particles essen tially all below 10 microns in diameter. The product is reblended before packaging. The ingredients are thoroughly blended, passed through an air mill, to produce an average particle size under 15 microns, reblended, and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening before packaging. All compounds of the invention may be formulated in the same manner. The ingredients are blended in a rotating mixer and water sprayed on to accomplish granulation. When most of the material has reached the desired range of 1.0 to 0.42 mm U.S.S. 18 to 40 sieves , the granules are removed, dried and screened. Oversize material is crushed to produce additional material in the desired range. These granules contain 6 active ingredient. The ingredients are ground together in a sand mill until the solid particles have been reduced to under about 5 microns. The resulting thick suspension may be applied directly, but preferably after being extended with oils or emulsified in water. The ingredients are combined and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all below 3 microns. The product can be used directly, extended with oils, or emulsified in water. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled until all the solids are essentially under 50 microns, re blended, and packaged. The ingredients are blended, coarsely hammer milled and then air milled to produce particles essen tially all below 10 microns in diameter. The product is reblended before packaging. A slurry of wettable powder containing 25 solids is sprayed on the surface of attapulgite granules while tumbling in a double cone blender. The granules are dried and packaged. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled and then moistened with about 12 water. The mixture is extruded as cylinders about 3 mm diameter which are cut to produce pellets about 3 mm long. These may be used directly after drying, or the dried pellets may be crushed to pass a U.S.S. No. 20 sieve 0.84 mm openings . The granules held on a U.S.S. No. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings may be packaged for use and the fines recycled. The ingredients are ground together in a sand mill until the solid particles have been reduced to under about 5 microns. The resulting thick suspension may be applied directly, but preferably after being extended with oils or emulsified in water. The ingredients are thoroughly blended. After grinding in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns, the material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening and packaged. The active ingredient is dissolved in the solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the blender is allowed to run for a short period and then the granules are packaged. The ingredients are blended and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all under 5 microns in size. The salt is added directly to the water with stirring to produce the solution, which may then be packaged for use. The active ingredient is dissolved in a solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the material is warmed to evaporate the solvent. The material is allowed to cool and then packaged. The ingredients are blended and milled to pass through a 100 mesh screen. This material is then added to a fluid bed granulator, the air flow is adjusted to gently fluidize the material, and a fine spray of water is sprayed onto the fluidized material. The fluidiza tion and spraying are continued until the granules of the desired size range are made. The spraying is stopped, but fluidization is continued, optionally with heat, until the water content is reduced to the desired level, generally less than 1 . The material is then discharged, screened to the desired size range, generally 14 100 mesh 1410 149 microns , and packaged for use.

The ground concentrate is then blended with powdered pyrophyllite until homogeneous. Test results indicate that the compounds of the present invention are highly active pre emergent or post emergent herbicides or plant growth regulants. Many of them have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, parking lots, drive in theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Some of the compounds have utility for selective weed control in crops such as wheat and barley. Alternatively, the subject compounds are useful to modify plant growth. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as plant growth modifiers or as herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, form ulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.005 to 10 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for plant growth modifications or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide exam ples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject com pounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow. Seeds of crabgrass
