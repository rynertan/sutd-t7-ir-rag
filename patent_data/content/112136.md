# INSERTS FOR CUTTING TOOLS

## Abstract
Inserts 210 which are asymmetrical in shape, for cutting tools and having improved strength at a corner of the insert, are described. The insert 210 has two parallel asymmetrical side faces 220 and contiguous edge faces wherein cutting edges 212 218 are formed at the junction of at least one of the side faces 220 and each of the contiguous edge faces. The asymmetry of the insert is such that when in use in a drill, the inserts cannot be incorrectly indexed in the drill. At least one of the asymmetrical side faces 220 of the insert for cutting tools has an asymmetrical chip breaker 232 therein capable of providing strength at the corner 222,226 of the insert, especially at the corner of the insert which forms a center line of the drill when in use. In preferred embodiments, the indexable inserts 220 are rhombic or octagonal in shape.
