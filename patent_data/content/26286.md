# Hyphen code converting process for a text processing system.

## Abstract
In a text processing system including a keyboard 8 , a printing mechanism 6 , a controlling logic device 2 and a storage 10 , the hyphen code that is stored in storage 10 in response to depression of a hyphen key on keyboard 8 is conditioned on printing position and on the codes adjacent to the hyphen code in a text string. If a hyphen is keyed after the start of the return zone, is preceded by a graphic representative code and is followed by a keyed carrier return, a distinctive hyphen code representative of a syllable hyphen is recorded. Otherwise, a regular hyphen is recorded unless the hyphen key has been depressed in conjunction with a condition key, in which case a code representative of a required non breaking hyphen is recorded. As a result of so controlling the recorded hyphen codes at the time of keyboarding, the operator s intentions for hyphenation may be achieved with little departure from normal keyboarding routine.
