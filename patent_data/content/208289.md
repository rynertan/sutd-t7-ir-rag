# Readout and obliteration head particularly for magnetic cards.

## Abstract
This readout and obliteration head comprises, on a load bearing frame 1 , an entry 2 for a magnetic card in com munication with a channel 3 receiving a portion of the mag netic card. A magnetic card readout and obliteration assembly 10 is supported in the frame 1 and is connected to a first motor 21 for translating to and away from the channel 3 and therefore an inserted magnetic card and to a second motor 32 for rotating the assembly 10 with respect to the card and effectuation of readout and obliteration of the card. The head further comprises a centering and locking pin 40 driven by the first motor 21 for locking the card during readout and obliteration of card.
