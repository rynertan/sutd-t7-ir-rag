# Sound reproducing system having sonic image localization networks.

## Abstract
In a sound reproduction system having two loudspeakers 1,1b located in front of a listener, an input audio signal is divided into a plurality of channel signals which are respec tively applied through voltage adjusting devices 3 to the front loudspeakers and also to additional speakers 1c, 1d or localization networks 15 to generate additional real or phan tom sound sources at 90 degrees to the normal to the lis tener. The additional sound sources and the front loudspeak ers are located symmetrically with respect to the listener. By manual operation of the adjusting devices a sonic image can be localized at any point in the front half plane. Continual operation of the adjusting devices causes the localized sonic image to be moved continuously within the localizable area.
