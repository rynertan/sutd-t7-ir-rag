# Demand responsive flow control valve mechanism.

## Abstract
A demand responsive flow control valve mechanism re ceives fluid flow from a power steering pump 10 and de livers a predetermined amount of fluid to an operating system such as a power steering gear 20 , with excess fluid being directed to a bypass port 24 , and thence to the pump or a reservoir 14 . Fluid flow to the operating system is controlled by dif ferential areas of a valve spool 40 , and a flow regulating orifice 38 sensitive to system flow for determining the pres sure differential to be applied to the differential areas. The operating system has a variable orifice 28 which serves as a demand regulator for establishing the pressure level re quirements for the pump. The valve spool responds to the pressure differential and system pressure level to bypass fluid as required. A pair of check valves 50,52 are disposed in the valve spool and are operable to provide two stages of pressure relief for the operating system.
