# Visor actuating mechanism.

## Abstract
A visor mechanism 50 suitable for use with a visor assembly 20 comprising a visor body 22 and means 32, 34, 37, 38, 42 for moveably mounting the visor body to a vehicle for movement between stored and use positions, the actuating mechanism comprising bias means 52 , in the form of a coil spring, coupled to the mounting means for urging the visor body toward the use position and a latching assembly 70 for releas ably holding the visor body in a stored position against the force provided by the bias means. The releasable catch 70 may be an electrically actuated solenoid 78 coupled to a locking arm 72 which, when the solenoid is actuated by an electrical push button switch 84 , effects release of the latching mechanism to permit the bias spring 52 to urge the visor downwardly from the stored position.
