# Semi automatic hot wire tig welding equipment.

## Abstract
A semi automatic hot wire TIG Tungsten Inert Gas weld ing equipment comprising a portable TIG arc torch a portable filler wire feed torch a hot wire switching power source for energizing the TIG arc torch, the filler wire feed torch and a base metal a filler wire feeding device for feeding the wire to the wire feeding torch at a desired rate a welding condition control device for controlling wire heating power so as to provide wire heating power commensurate to the wire feed rate and a voice identification control device for identifying an aural signal from a welder to set the welding conditions and transmitting the same to the welding condition control device. According to the present invention, the welding opera tions are performed while the filler wire feed torch is held in one hand and the TIG arc torch is held in the other hand, so that the position where the arc and wire are inserted can be desiderably adjusted. Although the both hands are occupied, commands are given aurally, so that adjustment of the welding conditions such as regulation of the welding arc current and adjustment of wire feed rate can be readily performed during welding.
