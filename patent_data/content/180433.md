# Charge transfer media and process for making thereof.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to novel electrostatic charge transfer media and a method for preparing said media. In electrophotography or electrostatic printing, the prior art techniques for accomplishing charge transfer from one surface to another involves either 1 conduction of electric charges across an air gap, or 2 direct charge transfer if the air gap is eliminated. While the air breakdown charge transfer technique is simple, it does not provide high resolution less than 80 line pairs per millimeter 1p mm can be achieved or continuous tone gray scale reproduction. The presently known techniques for direct charge transfer require a very smooth surface, a transfer liquid interfacing the donor and receptor films, very high pressures to eliminate the air gap, or a surface provided with a multitude of conductivity sites. However, most direct charge transfer techniques are too slow for many commercial applications, e.g. duplication of customers checks by banks. This invention involves an article having improved electrostatic charge transfer properties. The improvement in charge transfer properties results from subjecting a layer of photoconductive insulative material or dielectric material on the charge donor or a layer of dielectric material on the charge receptor, or both layers, to plasma treatment process to provide an oxygen enriched surface to the photoconductive insulative layer and or the dielectric layer. The articles of this invention provide transfer of charge with high efficiency, high resolution, and at much higher speeds than has previously been possible.
