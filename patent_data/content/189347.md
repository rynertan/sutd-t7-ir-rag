# Second order all pass network.

## Abstract
A second order all pass network for wide band signals, and comprising second and third voltage current converting circuits 20, 10 with their respective positive input terminals supplied with input signals from an input terminal Ti of the network and their negative input terminals supplied without put signals from an output terminal To of the network. Afirst voltage current converting circuit 30 has its positive input terminal supplied with a positive output of the second volt age current converting circuit 20 and a negative input ter minal supplied with the output signals. A first capacitor C1 is connected between the input and output terminals Ti, To , and a second capacitor C2 is connected between ground and the positive output of the second voltage current con verting circuit 20 .
