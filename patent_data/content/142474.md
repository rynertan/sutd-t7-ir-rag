## Description
he present invention relates to a wall expansion small block, particularly for hollow tile walls and the like. As it is known, several types or expansion blocks are presently commercially available, which generally consist of a cylindrical body provided, at one end thereof, with a small collar and including a pair of substantially semicircular wings or legs extending from the mentioned collar and erfective to be inserted into a hole as formed in the wall. By introducing a set screw, the mentioned two legs are caused to diverge from one another, with a substantially radial movement, thereby obtain ing a gooa anchoring of the expansion small block in the wall. While the hereinabove mentioned type or expansion Dlock has arforded generally satisIactory results with the so called solid walls,it is however of very poor performance as it is applied to the nollow tile wally since, as the set screw iu applied, the mentionea legs are caused to diverge, thereby the set screw is able of engaging the small expansion flock exclusively at tne collar region. Thus, the set screw may loose due to vibration, and disengage rrom the expansion block. Anotrier drawback or the known small expansion blocks is that the set screw, which is not firmly locked in the small block, because or the continuous movements it is subjected to,inevitaoiy produces an enlargea zone at the thread engagement region ana accordingly is susceptible to disengaging. Accordingly, the task or the present invention is to Overcome the hereinabove mentioned drawbacks, by providing such a wall expansion small bock which is effective to engage the set screw across its overall length, thereby preventing the set screw rrom disengaging even in highly stressed and vibration conditions. Within that task, it is a main object or the present invention to provide such a wall expansion small block which,owing to it8 mentioned characteristics,Is partlcularly effective to be used for hollow tile walls, or in walls therein gaps are rormed,while being provided ror a general purpose use. Another object of the present invention is to provide such a wall expansion small block which, owing to its arrangement ana construction, is very reliable in operation. According to one aspect or the present invention, the above task and objects,as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent herein after, are achieved by a wall expansion small block characterized in that it comprises a substantially tubular cylindrical body, provided with a longitudinal slot extending through the overall length of said boey,and effective to be inserted into a hole formea in said wall, the hollow or bore of said body, therein a screw may be engaged,havlng a first portion or enlarged diameter. Further characteristics and advantages or the wall expansion small block according to the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailea description of a preferred embodiment of said block,being illustrated, by way of an example and not of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawing,where yig.l is a perspective view illustrating the small expansion block according to the present invention Pig. 2 is a longitudinal cross sectional view of that same small expansion block and Fig.3 is a schematic view illustrating the small expansion block as applied to a hollow tile wall. With reference to the above mentioned figures,the wall expansion small block according to the present invention, indicated overally at I, comprises a substantially cylindrical body 2,provided with an abutment collar 2 which is preferably made starting from a suitable plastics material. That body defines, at its front end, in the introduction direction or said body, an outer tapering portion 3,of frustum shape, effective to facilitate the insertion of said body into a hole 4 formed in the wall. In its inside the body 2 defines a hollow or bore 5,extending for the overall length of said body and provide,at its rear end portion, that is at that end which will be flush with the wall, with an enlarged diameter portion 6,ending with a frustun shaped taperea zone 6 effective to act as a lead in element for the set screw . A main feature or the present invention that the body 2 is provided with a longitudinal slot 8 which preferably extends through the overall length of said body and is effective to allow for said body to radially expand as the set screw is inserted thereinto which set screw its it is known, has a diameter greater than the diameter of the hollow or oore 5, which latter is of elliptical shape, that is with a respective enlarged portion on either side there or. With the disclosea arrangement,the screw engages the surrace of the hollow 5,in the inside of the body 2, through the overall length of the small block, even if the latter is inserted into a hollow tile wall or into a wall therein gaps are formed. As it is known,in this type or application, the conventional expansion small blocks,providea with a middle slot, tend to open and engage the set screw exclusively at the solia tnlckess of the tile or wall and, accordingly, they may disengage because of vibratlons. On the contrary, in the dlsclosea embodiment the complete engagement between the set screw and expansion small block affords the possibility or firmly anchoring the expansion block to the wall, thereby the expansion block stabilizing effect will be obtained not only at the wall thickness, but also through the overall length of the expansion block, with surprising practical results. More specifically, the provision in the inside or the expansion small block of of a first enlarged diameter hollow portion 6 which substantially extends through the overall thickness of the plastering y and hollow tile l ,arfords the possibility or inserting into said small expansion block set screws having comparatively greater cross sections tham the inner cross section of that portion or the expansion small block which protrudes from the tile itselr. It should also bt noted that the body 2 of the expansion small block is provided with suitably enlarged wall portions 11 and 11 which are such that, as the set screw is introduced into the solid material or a wall, it will be screwed into the expansion block,whereas,as said screw passes through gaps of the wall, it causes the body 2 of the expansion block to expand at said gaps. Thus, the body 2 tends to radially expand,in such a way as to be firmly anchored in the wall, even in the case of hollow tiles, there by the engagement between the wall and the small expansion block will be reduced to a very small zone. However, also in that case, the set screw will be fully engaged in the small expansion block, thereby it will afford a sure coupling. From the above disclosure and the figures of the accompanying drawings, there will be self evident the great Buncrionality and use facility characteriz ing the wall expansion small block according to the present invention. In particular it is to be pointed out that the constructional approach ot designing the body 2 with a single cut portion,consisting or the slot ts,is effective to prevent said body from being spread apart and removed from the set screw on the contrary it will closely encompass said set screw,tiereby the latter will engage the expansion small block in a very stable condition. In practicing the invention,though the best results have been obtained by using plastics materials, the used materials may be any, depending on the contingent requirements.
