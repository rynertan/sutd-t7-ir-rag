# APPARATUS FOR COUPLING SHAFTS, APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING TORQUE FROM ONE SHAFT TO ANOTHER, AND AN AUTOMOTIVE POWER TRAIN

## Abstract
An apparatus is provided for transferring torque from one shaft to another. The shafts 11 and 12 are coupled together using a flexible member, such as elastomeric spring or belt 23 , trained around pins 21 eccentrically mounted on at least two planet gears 19 . A sun gear 15 which is connected to one of the shafts 11 meshes with the planet gears. These gears 19 are also connected to the other shaft 12 , either through a ring gear 66 or pivots 27 . When one of the shafts is rotated, this causes the planet gears 19 to rotate, and this rotation moves the pins 21 in an arc. This gradual controlled movement of the pins 21 causes the belt 23 to stretch in a manner so that as torque is transferred from one shaft to the other, troublesome torsional vibrations are effectively damped. This energy absorbing, torque cushioning apparatus is particularly suited for use as a lock up clutch in motor vehi cles.
