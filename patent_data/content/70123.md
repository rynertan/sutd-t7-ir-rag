# Improvements in or relating to burner control.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned to control the combustion conditions of a burner 1 supplied with a mixture of pulve rized fuel and air. By use of a vortex amplifier 10 in the supply pipe 3, the supply of fuel is interrupted so that the flame is consequently first too lean and then too rich. The tempera ture of the burner flame is monitored by a photodiode device 6a and an indication is produced of the delay between the operation of the vortex amplifier 10 and the flame tempera ture passing through that indicating that the flame condi tions are optimum. The length of the delay will indicate whether, and to what extent, the flame before the operation of the vortex amplifier was too lean or too rich. Adjacent burners can be controlled by operating the vortex amplifiers associated with each at different regular frequencies.
