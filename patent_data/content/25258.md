# Configured impact member for driven flywheel impact device.

## Abstract
Impact member 14 for driven flywheel 11 impact devices, such as nailers and staplers, which may be config ured to tailor the normal force as a function of ram position. A basic configuration is a constant taper, which, as soon as the impact member 14 is actuated by a flywheel 11 , assists in maintaining driving friction on the impact member 14 . The taper may be linear, stepped or curved, and symmetric or asymmetric about the longitudinal axis of the ram, whereby to tailor the impact member 14 speed for different purposes.
