# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING FUEL INJECTION PUMP

## Abstract
According to the present invention, control parameters for the amount of fuel to be injected and the fuel injection timing respectively are derived from the fuel injection command from an accelerator pedal and operation para meters fed back from an engine, and control quantities are calculated from the operation parameters for controlling actuators 11, 16 so that there are no differences between the actually controlled quantities fed back from the actuators 11, 16 and the calculated control quantities respectively.
