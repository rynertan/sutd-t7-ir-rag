Another process for preparing a 3,4 dihydro compound of Formula I comprises reacting a l Q 2 alkanone II supra with a lower alkyl Rl ss R2 acrylate of the formula R2 CH C R1 COOR3 V to produce lower alkyl 2 R1 3R2 4 Q 4 RCO butanoate having the Formula VI EMI5.1 reacting VI with ammonia or source thereof to produce 3,4 dihydro 3 R1 4 R2 5 Q 6 R 2 lH pyridinone having Formula I above, where R1 and R2 are each hydrogen or methyl, R and R3 are each lower alkyl, and Q is 4 or 3 methoxyphenyl, 4 or 3 pyridinyl or 4 or 3 pyridinyl having one or two lower alkyl substituents, and, if desired, converting the compound havingFormula I where Q is 4 or 3 methoxyphenyl to the compound having Formula I where Q is 4 or 3 hydroxyphenyl.Preferably, R3 in the first step is methyl or ethyl and ammonium acetate i8 used as the source of ammonia in the second step. Another process for preparing a 3,4 dihydro compound of Formula I comprises reacting a 1 Q 2 alkanone II with an a Rl ss R2 acrylamide of the formula R2 CH C R1 CONH2 VII in an inert solvent in the presence of a strong base, preferably an alkali metal tertiary butoxide, to produce 3,4 dihydro 3 R. 4 R2 5 a 6 R 2 1H pyridinone havingFormula I, where R1 and R2 are each hydrogen or methyl, R is lower alkyl, and Q is 4 or 3 methoxyphenyl, 4 or 3 pyridinyl or 4 or 3 pyridinyl having one or two loweralkyl substituents, and, if desired, converting the compound having Formula I where Q is 4 or 3 methoxyphenyl to the compound having Formula I where Q is 4 or 3 hydroxyphenyl. Preferably dioxane and potassium or sodium tertiary butoxide are used in the first step. One can heat 3,4 dihydro 3 Rl 4 R2 5 Q 6 R 2 1H pyridinone having the Formula IA EMI6.1 in a suitable inert solvent in the presence of sulfur to produce 3 Rl 4 R2 5 Q 6 R 2 lH pyridinone having theFormula IBEMI6.2 where R1 and R2 are each hydrogen or methyl, R is loweralkyl, and 0 is 4 our 3 methoxyphenyl, 4 or 3 hydroxyphenyl, 4 or 3 pyridinyl or 4 or 3 pyridinyl having one or two lower alkyl substituents, and, if desired, converting the compound having Formula IB where 9 is 4 or 3 methoxyphenyl to the corresponding compound having FormulaIB where 0 is 4 or 3 hydroxyphenyl.Preferably the inert solvent is a eutectic mixture of diphenyl and diphenyl ether DOWTHERMA . Said process is also applicable to the preparation of compounds of the Formula IA where R1 and R2 are both hydrogens, thus including prior art compounds acknowledged above. However, said process is preferably carried out to prepare novel compounds of the invention where at least one of R1 or R2 is methyl. Another process for preparing the 3,4 unsaturated compounds of Formula IB comprises heating a mixture of a l Q 2 alkanone of the Formula Q CH2 C O R II and acetoacetamide with polyphosphoric acid to produce 4 methyl 5 Q 6 R 2 1H pyridinone IB, R1 is hydrogen and R2 is methyl , where R is lower alkyl, Q is 4 or 3 methoxyphenyl, 4 or 3 pyridinyl or 4 or 3 pyridinyl having one or two lower alkyl substituents, and, if desired, converting said 4 methyl 5 Q 6 R 2 1H pyridinone whereQ is 4 or 3 methoxyphenyl to the corresponding compound where Q is 4 or 3 hydroxyphenyl, Preferably the reaction is run also using methanesulfonic acid in addition to the polyphosphoric acid. The term lower alkyl , as used herein to defineR, R3 or the substituents of 4 or 3 pyridinyl, means alkyl radicals having from one to four carbon atoms which can be arranged as straight or branched chains, illustrated by methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, 2 butyl or isobutyl. Illustrative of Q in formulas I, II, IV or VI where 9 is 4 or 3 pyridinyl having one or two loweralkyl substituents are the following 2 methyl 4 pyridinyl, 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl, 3 methyl 4 pyridinyl, 2 methyl 3 pyr idinyl, 6 methyl 3 pyr idinyl alternatively named 2 methyl 5 pyridinyl , 2,3 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl, 2,6 dimethyl 4 pyridinyl, 2 ethyl 4 pyridinyl, 2 isopropyl4 pyridinyl, 2 n butyl 4 pyridinyl, 2,6 diethyl 4 pyridinyl, 2,6 diethyl 3 pyridinyl, 2,6 diisopropyl 4 pyridinyl, and the like. The basic compounds of the invention having formula I where Q is a pyridinyl substituent are useful both in the free base and in the form of acid addition salts, and both forms are within the purview of the invention.The acid addition salts are simply a more convenient form for use and in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose anions are relatively innocuous to the animal organism in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial cardiotonic properties inherent in the free base form of the cardiotonically active compounds of the invention are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions.In practicing the invention, it is convenient to use the free base form however, appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention are those derived from mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid and organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylsulfamic acid, quinic acid, and the like, giving the hydrochloride, sulfate, phosphate, sulfamate, acetate, citrate, lactate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p toluenesulfonate, cyclohexylsulfamate and quinate, respectively. The acid addition salts of said basic compounds of formula I are prepared either by dissolving the free base in aqueous or aqueous alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the appropriate acid and isolating the salt by evaporating the solution, or by reacting the free base and acid in an organic solvent, in which case the salt separates directly or can be obtained by concentration of the solution. Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition salts are within the scope of our invention. All acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt per se is desired only as an intermediate product as for example when the salt is formed only for purposes of purification or identification, or when it is used as an intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures. The molecular structures of the compounds of the invention were assigned on the basis of evidence provided by infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectra, and by the correspondence of calculated and found values for the elemental analyses. The manner of making and using the instant invention will now be generally described so as to enable a person skilled in the art of pharmaceutical chemistry to make and use the same. The reaction of a l Q 2 alkanone of the formula Q CH2 C O R II with an a Rl B R2 acrylonitrile of the formula R2 CH C R1 CN III to produce 2 R1 3 R24 Q 4 RCO butanenitrile IV is run by mixing the reactants at ambient temperature or in an ice bath in the presence of a strong base, such as an alkali hydride or alkaline metal hydride, preferably sodium hydride in mineral oil, or an alkali metal lower alkoxide, preferably sodium methoxide in a lower alkanol, preferably methanol. Other suitable strong bases include potassium tert. butoxide, potassium methoxide, sodamide, benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, 1,5 diazobicyclot4.3.0 non 5 ene DBN , and the like.Other suitable solvents include p dioxane, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, hexamethylphosphortriamide, Nmethylpyrrolidone, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the like. The reaction of the l Q 2 alkanone II with a lower alkyl alpha R1 ss R2 acrylate of the formula R2 CH C R1 COOR3 V to produce lower alkyl 2 R1 3 R2 4 Q 4 RCO butanoate of formula VI is conveniently carried by mixing the reactants at about OOC. to 100 C., preferably at about 200C. to 400C., in the presence or absence of a suitable solvent such as ethanol, methanol, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, nitromethane, and the like. Optionally, the reaction can be expedited by adding a small quantity of a substance such as a 40 solution of benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide in methanol. The conversion of 2 Rl 3 R2 4 Q 4 RCO butanenitrile IV to 3,4 dihydro 3 R1 4 R2 5 Q 6 R 2 1H pyridinone I is carried out by reacting IV with a strong acid in the absence or presence of a suitable solvent. For example, the reaction can be run by adding a strong mineral acid such as concentrated sulphuric acid to IV cooled in an icélbath and then allowing the reaction mixture to stand at room temperature alternatively the reaction can be run by bubbling hydrogen chloride gas into a solu tion of IV in a suitable solvent such as absolute ethanol or other lower alkanol. Also, this conversion can be carried out using as the strong acid polyphosphoric acid or concentrated phosphoric acid, preferably heating on a steam bath. The conversion of lower alkyl 2 R1 3 R2 4 Q 4 RCO butanoate VI to 3, 4 dihydro 3 R1 4 R2 5 0 6 R 2 lH pyridinone I is conveniently carried out by heating VI with ammonia or a source of ammonia such as ammonium acetate in a suitable solvent such as ethanol. The reaction can be run at about OOC. to 1000C., preferably about 500C. to 900C. Other sources of ammonia include ammonium chloride, ammonium carbonate, ammonium formate, and the like. Optionally, the reaction can be run under pressure using ammonia. Other suitable solvents include methanol, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, p dioxane, nitromethane, and the like. The reaction of l Q 2 alkanqne II with an R1 S R2 acrylamide VII is conveniently run in an inert solvent and in the presence of a strong base, preferably an alkali metal tertiary butoxide, preferably by mixingII, VII and potassium tertiary butoxide in p dioxane at ambient temperature and then heating if necessary up to about 1000C., to produce 3,4 dihydro 3 R1 4 R2 5 Q 6 R 2ilH pyridinone I . Other suitable inert solvents and strong bases include those given above in the reaction of II and III to produce IV. The conversion of the 3,4 dihydro 3 R1 4 R2 5 9 6 R 2 1H pyridinone IA to the corresponding 3 R1 4 R2 5 Q 6 R 2 1H pyridinone IB is carried out by heatingIA in a suitable inert solvent, preferably a eutectic mixture of diphenyl and diphenyl ether Dowtherm A , in the presence of sulfur. Preferably about one mole of sulfur per one mole of the 3,4 dihydro 2 1H pyridinone is used. The reaction is carried out at about 1500C, to 2500C., preferably about 1700C. to 2200C. Other solvents that can be used include mineral oil, l methyl 2 pyrrolidinone, diethyl phthalate, and the like.Dimethyl sulfoxide can be used as solvent only when Q in IA is 4 or 3 methoxyphenyl or 4 or 3 hydroxyphenyl and, tetramethylene sulfoxide can be used here in place of dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction of a l Q 2 alkanone 11 and acetoacetamide with polyphosphoric acid to produce 4 methyl 5 Q 6 R 2 lH pyridinone IB, R1 is hydrogen and R2 is methyl is carried out by heating the reactants at about 700C. to 1500C., preferably about 1100C. to 1300C. Optionally and preferably, the reaction is run also using a mixture of polyphosphoric acid and methanesulfonic acid to make the reaction mixture more fluid. The conversion of 3 Rl 4 R2 5 Q 6 R 2 1H pyri dinone or 3,4 dihydro 3 R1 4 R2 5 Q 6 R 2 lH pyridinone ofFormula I as defined above where Q is 4 or 3 methoxyphenyl to the corresponding compound I where 0 is 4 or 3 hydroxyphenyl is conveniently carried out by conventional means of cleaving a methoxyphenyl compound to produce the correspond ing hydroxyphenyl compound, such as by heating a collidine solution of the methoxyphenyl compound I or II in the presence of lithium iodide. This conversion can be run by refluxing I or II where Q is 4 or 3 methoxyphenyl with concentrated 48 hydrobromic acid, concentrated 57 hydriodic acid, concentrated 85 phosphoric acid or with aluminum trichloride or boron trifluoride in toluene.

The utility of the compounds of Formula I where Q is 4 or 3 hydroxyphenyl, 4 or 3 pyridinyl or 4 or 3 pyridinyl having one or two lower alkyl substituents or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts when Q is a pyridinyl substituent as cardiotonic agents is demonstrated by their effectiveness in standard pharmacological test procedures, for example, in causing a significant increase in contractile force of the isolated cat or guinea pig atria and papillary muscle and or in causing a significant increase in the cardiac contractile force in the anesthetized dog with low or minimal changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Detailed descriptions of these test procedures appear in U.S. Patent 4,072,746. When tested by said isolated cat or guinea pig atria and papillary muscle procedure, the compounds ofFormula I of the invention or said salts thereof at doses of 1 3,4 dihydro compounds of Formula I only , 3, 10, 30 and or 100 ug ml., were found to cause significant increases, that is, greater than 25 cat or 30 g. pig in papillary muscle force and significant increases, that is greater than 25 cat or 30 g. pig in right atrial force, while causing a lower percentage increase about one half or less than the percentage increase in right atrial force or papillary muscle force in right atrial rate. Because of the lower control active tensions of guinea pig tissues, the percent change from control values of both rate and force responses is elevated slightly, i.e., 5 .Thus, whereas cardiotonic activity is ascertained with a papillary muscle force or right atrial force increase of 26 and greater in the cat test, corresponding activity in the guinea pig test is designated with a papillary muscle force or right atrial force increase of 31 or greater. For example, illustrative cat papillary muscle and right atrial force increases for a 3,4dihydro compound of the invention are 175 and 64 at 100 g ml, 129 and 53 at 30 Vg ml, and 109 and 51 at 10 g ml for the compound of Example C 2.Further, illustrative guinea pig papillary muscle and right atrial force increases for other 3,4 dihydro compounds of the invention are 100 and 118 at 100 g ml, 131t and 98 at 30 Vg ml and 100 and 65 at 10 g ml for the compound of Exarrqlle C l 157 and 1618 at 10 iig ml, 127 and 73 at 3 pg ml and 52 and 39 at 1 g ml for the compound of Example C 4 104 and 87 at 10 pg ml, and 64 and 72 at 3 g ml for the compound of Example C 6 and, 104 and 132 at 10 Vg ml for the compound of Example C 8. Similarly, for example, illustrative guinea pig papillary muscle and right atrial force increases for 3,4 unsaturated compounds of the invention are 119 and 108 at 30 g ml, 155 and 103 at 10 pg ml and 75 and 55 at 3 Vg ml for the compound of Example D l 103 and 263 at 100 ug ml, 86 and 145 at 30 g ml and 73 and 115 at 10 pg ml for the compound ofExample D 4 and, 105 and 70 at 10 g ml, and 98 and 82 at 3 pg ml for the compound of Example D 3. When tested by said anesthetized dog procedure, the 3,4 dihydro compounds of the invention or said salts thereof at doses of 0.10, 0.30, 1.0 and or 3.0 mg kg administered intravenously were found to cause significant increases, that is, 25 or greater, in cardiac contractile force or cardiac contractility with lower changes in heart rate and blood pressure. For example, the compound of Example C 4 was found to cause respective increases of 51 and 87 in contractile force cf at doses of 0.10 and 0.30 mg kg and, the compound of Example C 6 was found to cause respective cf increases of 41 , 77 and 107 at doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg kg. In clinical practice said compound will normally be administered orally or parenterally in a wide variety of dosage forms. Solid cardiotonic compositions for oral administration include compressed tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid compositions, at least one of the active compounds is admixed with at least one inert diluent such as starch, calcium carbonate, sucrose or lactose. These compositions can also contain additional substances other than inert diluents, erg., lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, talc and the like. Liquid cardiotonic compositions for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water and liquid paraffin. Besides inert diluents such compositions can also contain adjuvants, such as wetting and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring, perfuming and preserving agents.According to the invention, the compounds for oral administration also include capsules of absorbable material, such as gelatin, containing said active component with or without the addition of diluents or excipients. Preparations comprising compounds of the invention for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous, aqueous organic and organic solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Examples of organic solvents or suspending media are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate.These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as stabilising, preserving, wetting, emulsifying and dispersing agents. They can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, by incorporation of sterilising agents in the compositions, by irradiation or by heating. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. The percentage of active component in the said cardiotonic composition and its concentration when increasing cardiac contractility can be varied so that a suitable dosage is obtained. The dosage administered to a particular patient is variable, depending upon the clinician s judgement using as the criteria the route of administration, the duration of treatment, the size and condition of the patient, the potency of the active component and the patient s response thereto. An effective dosage amount of active component can thus only be determined by the clinician considering all criteria and utilizing his best jud t on the patient s behalf.
