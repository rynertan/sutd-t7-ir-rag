# REAL TIME SINGLE FRAME MEMORY FOR CONVERTING VIDEO INTERLACED FORMATS

## Abstract
A circuit for converting interlaced video data to nonin terlaced video data at 30 frames per second, real time video rate, where rows of successive lines of video data applied to a single frame memory 4 are provided having data control means including write in 7 and read out 8 means for initi ally sequentially loading each row of memory with lines of interlaced video data of the first frame sequentially applied to the memory, and thereafter reading out successive mem ory rows of the first frame memory, while replacing each line read out by whichever line of the second frame is applied to memory in real time just after read out, until all lines of data of the second frame have been inserted into memory. Suc cessive frames are read out using a row addressing incre ment of N 2 for the next frame and repeating similar write in and read out of subsequent frames while multiplying the denominator of the address incrementing factor by two for each subsequent frame until the factor would be less than unity, and thereafter increasing the factor back to N 2 to re peat the cycle so as to process subsequent frames.
