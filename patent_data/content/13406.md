# Apparatus for dynamically cooling and pumping molten thermoplastic material.

## Abstract
A dynamic cooler apparatus is provided for dynamically cooling molten plastic extrudate while pumping metered amounts of that extrudate to an extrusion die or the like. The dynamic cooler apparatus 100 utilizes bi helical gears GA, GB in a gear pump configuration in a housing in which a heat exchange medium is circulated. The heat exchange medium is also circulated internally of the gears so that the gear teeth GAT, GBT and the housing act to cool discrete volumes of extrudate from four sides defined by the gear teeth and the internal surface of the housing. The bi helical gears GA, GB are driven to minimize loading between the teeth GAT, GBT thereof and to permit the teeth GAT, GBT to be as small as practical to present more cooling surface for a given cross section of extrudate and optimize the heat transfer capability of the dynamic cooler apparatus. Provision is also made to use the molten extrudate as a lubricant for the shafts SA, SB and bearings SAB, SBB of the bi helical gears.
