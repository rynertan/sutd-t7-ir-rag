# Pin for brazing to a substrate.

## Abstract
A pin 6 is attached by braze material 3 to a solid state module 2 for making connection between the mod ule and other parts of a metallurgical system. The end of the pin that is brazed to the module has a sloping head of conical shape 7 , so that gas bubbles can readily escape during brazing, thus reducing voids in the braze.
