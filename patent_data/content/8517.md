# Duplex ultrasonic imaging system with repetitive excitation of common transducer in Doppler modality.

## Abstract
A duplex imaging system with a common transducer array 11 for both modes of operation satisfies the conflicting bandwidth requirements by single impulse excitation of the transducer 12 in B scan imaging operation to generate a wide bandwidth ultrasound pulse and multiple impulse exci tation at the emission frequency in Doppler mode operation to generate a narrow bandwidth ultrasound pulse. The multiple impulse excitation has a variable repetition frequency depending on range to a sample volume and velocity of blood flow. A Doppler modality in which the frequency shift of echoes caused by flow of blood is measured to derive the flow velocity, is incorporated into a sector scanner with little addi tional complexity.
