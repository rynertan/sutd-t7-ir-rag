## Description
The present invention relates to a soft magnetic thin film and more particularly to a soft magnetic thin film having high saturation magentic flux density and suitable for a magnetic transducer head. In magnetic recording apparatus such as, for example, video tape recorders VTRs , researches are being made towards increasing the recording density and the frequency of the recording signals. In keeping pace with the tendency towards high density recording, so called metal powder tapes making use of the powders of the ferromagnetic metals, such as Fe, Co or Ni, as magnetic powders, or so called evaporated metal tapes in which the ferromagnetic metal material is deposited on the base film, are also used as the magnetic recording medium. By reason of the high coercive force Hc of said magnetic recording medium, head materials of the magnetic head for both recording and replaying are required to have a high saturation magnetic flux density Bs and high permeability µ For instance, the ferrite material used frequently is low in saturation magnetic flux density Bs, whereas permalloy presents a problem in adrasion resistance. Fe Al Si alloys, so called sendust alloys are practically used to satisfy such requirement. In the sendust alloy, it is preferable to have magnetostriction λ s and crystalline magnetic anisotropy K both about zero. The composition of the sendust alloy for use in a magnetic transducer head is determined by considering the magnetostriction and the crystalline magnetic anisotropy. Thus the saturation magneitc flux density is uniquely determined by the composition. In sendust alloy, the saturation magnetic flux density is about 10000 to 11000 gauss at most, considering the soft magnetic property for use in magnetic transducer head. While, amorphous magnetic alloys are known which has high permeability at high frequency band and high saturations magnetic flux density. The amorphous magnetic alloy has the saturation magnetic flux density of 12000 gauss 1 Gauss 10 ⁴T 1 Devsted 79.6 A m 1 Torr 7,5 x 10 ³ Pa at most when considering the soft magnetic property. The amorphous magnetic alloy is not stable upon heat treatment, and changed into crystalline phase by heat treatment at, for example, 500 C which results in the loss of the magnetic characteristics that the amorphous phase had. In manufacturing magnetic transducer heads, various heat treatment is employed, for example, melt bonding of cores by glass at an elevated temperature. However in using amorphous magnetic mateiral, there are some restrictions of temperture in manufacturing process. Thus the prior art magnetic materials for magnetic transducer head core are still not satisfactory in saturation magnetic flux density to fully use the ability of high coercive force magnetic recording medium for high density recording. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved soft magnetic thin film having high saturation magnetic flux density. It is another object of the present invention to provide a soft magnetic thin film having high saturation magnetic flux density and improved corrosion resistance. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a soft magnetic thin film which has a composition comprising Fe In further aspect of the invention, part of the iron may be substituted by cobalt, with an amount of not more than 15 atomic percent of the total alloy composition. Ru may be contained in the alloy composition in an amount from 0.1 to 10 atomic percent to improve the abrasion resistance of the soft magnetic thin film. Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C are ternary diagram showings the magnetostriction s and crystalline magnetic anisotropy K of the ternary Fe alloys. Figure 2 is a graph showing the relationship of Co content and coercive force of the alloy of the present invention. Figure 3 is a graph showing annealing temperature dependency of coercive force. Figures 4 and 5 are B H hysterisis loop for explaining the present invention. Figure 6 is a graph showing the abrasion resistance characteristics of various alloys, and Figures 7 and 8 are graphs showing thickness dependency of coercive force and permeability respectively. On the course of the reseach to realize the object, the present inventors arrived at the following recognition. Then, in the present invention Fe Ga Si alloys and Fe Co Ga Si alloys are considered. In Figure 1A, the dotted line indicates the composition of the magnetostriction λ s equals to 0, while the solid line indicates the composition of crystalline magnetic anisotropy K equals to zero in case of Fe Ga Si ternary system alloy. Superior soft magnetic characteristics can be obtained around the area where the solid line and the dotted line cross with each other. Figures 1B, and 1C shows λ s equals to zero line and K equals to zero line for Fe Co Ga ternary system alloy, and Fe Co Si ternary system alloy respectively. In case of Fe Co Ga Si system alloy, considering the 3 dimentional phase diagram, a plane representing K 0, and a plane representing λs 0 exists at Fe rich side, and soft magnetic characteristics can be obtained around the cross line of the planes. From another point of view that Co is added to Fe Ga Si ternary alloy, saturation magnetic flux density corrosion resistance, and abrasion resistance are improved by addition of Co, however, too much addition of Co, result in reduced Bs, and deteriorated soft magnetic characteristics. Figure 2 shows the relationship between amount of cobalt and coercive force after annealing at 500 C and 550 C for the composition Fe It is understood from Figure 2, that coercive force Hc shows the minimum value for 10 atomic percent of Co. Thus there is a desirable range of addition of Co. According to the experiments conducted by the present inventors, soft magnetic material having higher saturation magnetic flux density Bs than that of the sendust alloy and soft magnetic characteristics comparable to that of sendust alloy is obtained in case of Fe The soft magnetic thin film of the present invention may have a thickness of not less than 0.5 µm and not more than 100 µm. Figures 7 and 8 show thickness dependency of the coercive force and permeability at 1MHz measured on a film sample having composition Fe₇₃Ru₄Ga₁₀Si₁₃ after annealing at 450 C respectively. When the thickness is less than 0.5 µm, soft magnetic characteristics are deteriorated, while thickness exceeding 100 µm is difficult to obtain by physical vapour deposition process without inducing internal stress. The soft magnetic thin film may be manufactured by physical vapoar deposition process, such as sputtering, ion plating, vacuum evaporation, or cluster ion beam deposition. When adjusting the ratio values of the respective elements of the magnetic thin film, such as Fe, Ga or Si, the following methods may be employed. Fe, Ga, and Si are respectively weighed to make a predetermined composition. These materials were melted in RF induction heating furnace. The melt was cast and machined to make an alloy target for sputtering of 4 inches in diameter and 4 mm thickness. Films were deposited on crystalline glass substrate HOYA PEG 3130C, made by Hoya Glass Company by using the sputtering target thus made in a RF magnetron sputtering apparatus. The sputtering was carried out under the condition of RF input of 300 W and Ar pressure of 5x10 ³ Torr to obtain films having 1 µm thickness. The obtained thin films were further annealed at 500 C under vacuum of less than 1x10 ⁶ Torr for 1 hour and cooled. By selecting the composition as shown in Table I, films of samples No. 1 through 14 were made. The traget composition and the deposited film composition are different with a little amount. The samples obtained were subjected to measurement of magnetic characteristics of saturation magnetic flux density Bs, coercive force Hc, saturation magnetization σ s, permeability µ at 1MHz and 100MHz, magnetostriction, and anti corrosion characteristics. The saturation magnetic flux density was measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer VSM , coercive force was measured by a B H roop tracer, permeability was measured by permeance metal using figure 8 coil. The thickness of the samples was determined by using multiple beam interferometer. The film comosition was determined by EPMA. The anti corrossion characteristics were examined according to the following standard by observing the appearance of the film surface after one week imersion of the film in water at room temparature. The obtained results are shown in Table I. In Table I, for comparison, Fe Si alloy electromagnetic steel and Fe Al Si alloy sendust were also prepared according to the method described above. It is understood from the table, the samples according to the present invention have much larger saturation magnetic flux density, and nearly equivalent soft magnetic property as composed with the sendust alloy film. The films of the present invention is by far superior in soft magnetic property than the Fe Si alloy film even though it has nearly equivalent magnetic flux density to the Fe Si film. The magnetostriction was estimated by the anisotropy field value upon application of tension and compression to the film. The magnetostriction was less than 1x10 ⁶ for each of the film samples of the present invention. In this example, the films deposited were subjected to an annealing treatment at 500 C. The sample No. 1 having a film composition of Fe Figure 4 is a B H hysterisis roop of as deposited film sample 2 having the film composition of Fe Targets containg Fe, Co, Ga and Si were prepared. Film samples No. 21 through 29 were deposited by the method explained in example 1. The deposited film were subjected to annealing at an elevated temperature between 450 C and 650 C in vacuum of less than 1x10 ⁶ Torr for 1 hour. The targer composition, film composition, various characteristics are shown in Table II. The optimum annealing temperature depends on the film composition, through by annealing between 450 C and 650 C soft magntic characteristics were greatly improved. Sputtering target containing Fe, Ru, Co, Ga and Si were prepared. Film samples No. 31 through 37 were deposited by the method described in example 1. The deposited film were subjected to annealing treatment at a temperature between 450 C and 650 C. The target composition, film composition and various characteristics are shown in Table III.
