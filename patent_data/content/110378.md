## Description
This invention relates to an ultrasonic probe including a piezo electric element having electrodes on both sides thereof said piezo electric element is rectangular in shape and has first and second electrodes respectively provided on at least a portion of first and second parallel surfaces of said piezo electric element, wherein said first and second electrodes have a facing region of overlap D substantially central to said piezo electric element with the interposition of piezoelectric material. The ultrasonic proble is suitable for use in an ultrasonic diagnostic system, ultrasonic flaw detection system or the like. An ultrasonic probe produces ultrasonic waves by a piezo electric element and inspects the internal state of an object on the basis of reflected waves of the ultrasonic waves. Ultrasonic probes are used in a variety of application fields, for example, for diagnoses of the interiors of human bodies and detections of flaws in metal welds. An ultrasonic probe is known from Patents Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 5, No. 205, Dec. 25, 1981 and the corresponding JP A 56 125 198, in which is provided a piezo electric element having electrodes on both sides thereof. From the document Mesures Régulation, Automatisme, November 1981, an ultrasonic probe is known which has a thin film of PVF₂ upon the surface of which metallization is provided acting as electrodes. Only the zone between the overlapping of this metallization is polarized whereas the rest of the film of PVF₂ being utilized for carrying the connection leads. The metallization has an overlap region which is provided substantially central to the piezo electric element with the interposition of the piezo electric material. FR A 2 001 797 discloses an electro acoustic converter comprising a piezo electric layer. Both sides of said piezo electric layer are provided with electrodes. These electrodes have a facing region of overlap in projection. In this area the electrical field is generated between the overlapping portions of both electrodes. An ultrasonic beam emitted from a piezo electric element has conventionally been focused using such means as an acoustic lens so that the resolution can be enhanced which is called a focused beam method. The focused beam method can certainly provide a high resolution near the focal point. It is, however, accompanied by a drawback that the resolution is lowered as the point of an inspection or diagnosis becomes away from the focal zone. With a view toward solving the above drawback, ultrasonic probes driven by a synthetic aperture method have been studied. The synthetic aperture method is a method in which fan beams having large beam spread are emitted from a number of measured points and a number of pieces of information on the object, which pieces of information have been collected from the measurement points, is synthesized to form a picture image of the object. According to the synthetic aperture method, the resolution is not governed by the distance but is determined by the beam spread of each ultrasonic beam. The resolution is improved as the beam spread becomes greater. Since a beam width is substantially in inverse proportion to the width of the aperture of the oscillating surface of a piezo electric element, it is desirous to make the width of each aperture as small as possible. The resultant resolution becomes substantially the same level as the width of the aperture of the oscillating surface of the piezo electric element. In the case of conventional utrasonic probes, there was however a limitation to the sizes of piezo electric elements suitable for use therein. If the width of a piezo electric element is 5 mm or thinner, the piezo electric element makes the fabrication of an ultrasonic probe very difficult. In the case of an array type ultrasonic probe which uses a plurality of piezo electric elements, the piezo electric elements can be obtained by slicing a single piece of piezo electric elements and their intervals may thus be reduced to several hundreds micrometers or so. Supposing that each piezo electric material has a rectangular shape, one of its sides may hence be shortened to several hundreds micrometers or so. However, a width of about 1 2 mm is necessary for connecting leads to the electrodes of a piezo electric material. Therefore, it is impossible to shorten the length of the other side beyond the above limitation, leading to a limitation to the size of a piezo electric element iself in its fabrication. Thus, it has been very difficult to reduce the width of the aperture of a piezo electric element and to enlarge the beam spread of an ultrasonic beam. With the foregoing in view, the present invention has been completed. It is an object of this invention to provide an ultrasonic probe according to the type given in the preamble of Claim 1 which provides a large beam spread and high resolution as well as an improved signal to noise ratio. This object is solved for an ultrasonic probe of the type given in the preamble of Claim 1 in that a grounded conductive layer is provided on an insulative layer which is provided on a surface of the piezo electric material from which surface ultrasonic waves are emitted, directly and via the respective electrode. The above mentioned first and second electrodes are herein meant to be either one of an earth electrode and a signal electrode, respectively. The term facing of electrodes as used herein means that the electrodes are facing or overlapping each other in the direction of polarization of the piezoelectric material. In a piezo electric element of this structure the piezo electric material is oszillated practically only at the portion where the electrodes are facing each other overlapping area in projection . Thus, the width of the aperture of the oszillating surface of the piezo electric element becomes substantially equal to the region of overlap of the portion where the electrodes are facing each other. Accordingly it is possible to obtain a piezoelectric element having a small aperture width by using a piezo electric material having substantially the same size as those used conventionally. By using the piezo electric element having the small aperture width an ultrasonic beam having a great beam spread can be emitted. When the ultrasonic probe of the invention is driven in accordance with the above described synthetic aperture method the resulting ultrasonic probe has a large beam spread and the resolution is of the same level as the width of the aperture. Thus, a high resolution can be achieved. The grounded conductive layer which is provided on the insulative layer provided on a surface of the piezo electric element, from which the surface ultrasonic waves are emitted, additionally provides the advantage that the ultrasonic probe having a large beam spread as mentioned above additionally has an improved signal to noise ratio. More specifically, since the surface of a piezoelectric material is shielded by providing a grounded conductive layer on a surface of the piezo electric element from which surface ultrasonic waves are emitted, the piezo electric element is less affected by external noises and its S N ratio is thus improved. Such noises tend to occur from a non electrode portion which is not covered by an electrode, out of the surface of the piezo electric material from which surface ultrasonic waves are emitted. Thus, the conductive layer may be provided on the non electrode portion only. It is, however, preferred to provide the conductive layer over the entire area of the surface of the piezo electric element from which surface ultrasonic wave are emitted, because the emission characteristics of ultrasonic wave may be adversely affected if the conductive layer is applied over the non electrode portion only. In addition, it is possible to avoid spurious oscillations when, of the first and second electrodes in the above probe, the electrode which is facing the conductive layer with the piezo electric material interposed therebetween is caused to have the same potential as the conductive layer. This effect has been derived for the following reasons. If the potential of the electrode which is facing the conductive layer with the piezo electric material interposed therebetween is different from that of the conductive layer, a voltage is applied to the piezo electric material because of a difference in potential between the conductive layer and the electrode. There is thus a danger that the piezo electric material may be oscillated at portions other than the portion where the first and second electrodes are facing each other. These oscillations are spurious and disturb ultrasonic beams to be emitted from the ultrasonic probe. As has been described, use of an ultrasonic probe according to this invention permits to obtain ultrasonic probe having a large beam spread and the provision of a grounded conductive layer can provide an ultrasonic probe having a good S N ratio. This invention will hereinafter be described in greater detail with reference to Figures 6 to 9 of the accompanying drawings, whereas Figures 1 to 5 are described for explaining the background and arrangement of the invention. Figure 1 is a partially cut away perspective view of an ultrasonic probe. The ultrasonic probe is an array type ultrasonic probe. A plurality of piezoelectric elements 1 each having a rectangular shape is fixedly mounted on a backing member 2, and the surfaces of the piezo electric elements 1 from which surfaces ultrasonic waves are emitted are covered by an acoustic matching layer 3. One of the piezo electric elements 1 is shown in Figure 2. Namely, Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of the piezo electric element 1, taken along the line A A of Figure 1. A first electrode 1b and a second electrode 1c are provided respectively on both surfaces of the piezo electric material 1a in such a way that they are partially overlapped near the center of the piezo electric material 1a to form a portion The formation of such a facing portion In the case of an ultrasonic diagnostic system for example, a resolution of about 1 mm to 2 mm, namely, a beam spread ϑ Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between aperture width and beam spread. The curve Since the aperture width of a piezo electric element can be readily made narrower by incorporating such a structure as described above, it is possible to obtain an ultrasonic probe which can emit ultrasonic beams having a large beam spread. Moreover, since the facing portion In the synthetic aperture method, detection of a flaw or the like is carried out by scanning an object with a piezo electric element which, as mentioned above, has a small aperture width d and can emit ultrasonic beams having a large beam width. Figure 4 schematically illustrates the detection of a point The beam spread of a piezo electric element having an aperture width The beam spread ϑ by the synthesized aperture width d is approximated with λ d . Owing to the relationship of may be approximated with Z when 2 is small. The resolution ΔX Z tan ϑ may on the other hand be approximated with Zϑ, because ϑ is generally small. Hence, Therefore, it is possible to obtain a resolution of substantially the same level as the aperture width. When the region of overlap Furthermore, the above ultrasonic probe may be applied to process signals by the synthetic aperture method in the A A direction of Figure 1 and the direction of alignment of a plurality of piezo electric elements may be set by the focused beam method. The greater the ultrasonic beam spread ϑ is made, the more information from the respective piezo electric elements can be obtained, thereby obtaining a higher resolution. In practical use, the spread ϑ kept at the level of about 10 or a little wider is very effective. Figures 5 a and 5 c are cross sectional views of piezo electric elements whereas Figure 5 b is a plan view of a piezo electric element 1. In these drawings, the manner of formation of the facing portion In Figure 5a, outward ends of the electrodes 1 b, 1c are both extended to their corresponding side walls of the piezo electric material so as to facilitate the leading out of the electrodes. In Figure 5 b , the facing portion In the above ultrasonic probes, the piezo electric elements were fabricated into array type ultrasonic transducers. It is however possible to bring about substantially the same effects as an array type ultrasonic transducer by causing a single type ultrasonic probe, which is formed of a single piece of piezo electric element, to scan mechanically. A first embodiment of this invention will next be described. Figure 6 is a cross sectional view of a piezoelectric element and acoustic matching layer. The piezo electric element 1 in the present embodiment has the same basic structure as the piezo electric element depicted in Figure 2. The acoustic matching layer has been formed by successively laminating an insulating layer 3a, a conductive layer 3b and a protective layer 3c in order. These layers are arranged in such a way that the protective layer 3c constitutes the outermost layer. The conductive layer 3b can be provided, for example, by coating a conductive paste, depositing a metal or adhering a metal foil. It is preferred to make the thickness of the conductive layer 3b sufficiently thin relative to the wavelength so that the conductive layer 3b does not impair the emission and reception of ultrasonic waves by the piezo electric element. The suitable thickness is of the level of 10 µm or so. The protective layer 3c is provided to protect the conductive layer 3b. A polymer film having excellent resistance to water and oil and electrically superb insulating property such as insulating varnish, polyimide, polyester or the like is used. It is also preferred to make the protective layer 3c sufficiently thin, preferably about 10 µm in thickness, relative to the wavelength so that the protective layer 3c does not impair the emission and reception of ultrasonic waves by the piezo electric element. Where it is unnecessary to provide the conductive layer 3b with resistance to water, oil, etc., it is not required to provide the protective layer 3c additionally. It is however preferred to provide, generally speaking, the protective layer 3c because an ultrasonic probe is normally used to emit ultrasonic wave into an object through water, oil or the like. Such conductive layer 3b and protective layer 3c may be provided at once if a printed flexible sheet having a conductive layer such as copper foil and made of a polyester, polyimide or the like is used. This is very advantageous from the viewpoint of fabrication. Where the insulating layer 3a is formed of a plurality of layers, it is unnecessary to provide any additional protective film if the conductive layer 3b is provided between such insulating layers. The acoustic matching layer 3 is formed generally with a thickness equivalent to one fourth of the wavelength λ of ultrasonic waves. The acoustic matching layer has heretofore been formed of an insulating layer only. Thus, the insulating layer has conventionally had a thickness of λ 4. In the present embodiment, it is preferred to adjust the thickness of the insulating layer 3a so that the total thickness of the insulating layer 3a, conductive layer 3b and protective layer 3c becomes λ 4 because the conductive layer 3b and protective layer 3c are provided additionally. Using a printed flexible sheet 70 µm thick including the layer of an adhesive made of 18 µm thick Cu and 25 µm thick polyimide as a conductive and protective film and making the portion of a piezo electric element at which portion the electrodes are facing each other be 1 mm, an ultrasonic probe of the aforementioned structure was fabricated. The ultrasonic probe was then driven in accordance with the synthetic aperture method. By using the above fabricated ultrasonic probe having the above described structure, a resolution of the level of 1 to 1.5 mm or so was achieved irrespective of the depth of an interested point in an object. The ultrasonic probe was free from the intrusion of noises from the outside and gave a dynamic range of 80 dB or higher and a good S N ratio. Still further embodiments of this invention are illustrated respectively in Figures 7 and 8. The embodiment shown in Figure 7 has the same structure as the embodiment depicted in Figure 6 except that the combination of grounding of the electrodes 1b, 1c and the conductive layer 3b has been changed. Figure 7 is a cross sectional view similar to Figure 6. In this embodiment, the conductive layer 3b and the electrode 1c which is located at the side of the backing member 2 are grounded whereas a voltage is applied to the electrode 1b. Conventionally, the electrode 1b located on the ultrasonic wave emitting surface, of the electrodes of the piezo electric element 1, was grounded and a voltage was applied to the electrode 1c positioned at the side of the backing member 2, not only as a countermeasure for the above described noises but also for avoiding electrical effects due to leakage of currents from the ultrasonic probe to the outside such as electric shock and the like. The conductive layer 3b which is provided to form an electromagnetic shield was also grounded as shown in Figure 6. In this case, the potential between the conductive layer 3b and electrode 1c may be applied to a non electrode portion of the ultrasonic wave emitting surface of the piezo electric element 1 which portion is not covered by the electrode 1c and spurious oscillations may thus be developed. Provision of the conductive layer 3b as in the present invention can prevent electrical effects to the outside, whereby making it unnecessary to additionally ground the electrode 1c placed on the ultrasonic wave emitting surface of the piezoelectric element 1. As illustrated in Figure 7, the electrode 1c is thus grounded when driving the ultrasonic probe. Where such a structure as mentioned above is employed, no potential difference is allowed to occur between the electrode 1c and conductive layer 3b and there is thus no danger to produce such spurious oscillations as mentioned above. It is also possible to avoid such spurious oscillations as mentioned above without changing the way of grounding in such a manner as employed in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 7. The embodiment of this invention, which is shown in Figure 8, is fabricated by using a material, in which ultrasonic waves are attenuated considerably, to form an insulating member 3a for a part which is in contact with a non electrode portion of the ultrasonic wave emitting surface of the piezo electric element 1 which portion is not covered by the electrode 1b. The remaining parts of the structure is similar to those of the embodiment shown in Figure 6. Figure 8 is a cross sectional view similar to Figure 6. In an ultrasonic probe having such a structure as illustrated in Figure 8, spurious oscillations are prevented from emitting their corresponding ultrasonic waves to the outside even if such spurious oscillations are produced, owing to the provision of the insulating member 3a made of a material in which ultrasonic waves are attenuated considerably. Accordingly, the ultrasonic probe of Figure 8 can bring about practically the same effect as an ultrasonic probe in which occurrence of spurious oscillations has been prevented. It is not always necessary to have the conductive layer 3b cover the entire area of the surface of the piezo electric element 1. In a still further embodiment of this invention illustrated in Figure 9, the conductive layer 3b is provided on a part of the corresponding surface of the piezo electric element 1 with the insulating layer 3a interposed therebetween. The remaining parts of the structure are the same as those of the embodiment illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 9 is a cross sectional view similar to Figure 6. In this embodiment, the conductive layer 3b is applied in such a way that it covers only a part of the ultrasonic wave emitting surface of the piezo electric element 1 which part is not covered by the electrode 1b. The electrode 1b serves as a shield for the surface of the piezoelectric element 1. Thus, intrusion of electromagnetic noises from the outside can be successfully avoided when only the part of the surface, which part is not covered by the electrode 1b, is covered by the conductive layer 3b.
