## Abstract
Apparatus in plants, particularly for use in making master phonograph records and the like. In plants for galvanic processing in making master phonograph records, the apparatus in accordance with the invention comprises an arrangement of the recepta cle 12 containing anode material 16 such that the electrolyte 2 is constrained 19, 35 to a given extent to flow through the receptacle in a direction from the surrounding liquid in a processing tub 1 . The receptacle 12 is connected to an outlet 35 for liquid such that there is always a level 37 of liquid in the receptacle lower than the level thereof in the tub. By means of the liquid flow there is gained that particles which may be liberated from the anode material are not carried over to the object on which electro deposition takes place.
