# FIRE RETARDANT, CURABLE, ETHYLENICALLY UNSATURATED COMPOSITIONS AND SHAPED ARTICLES PREPARED FROM THESE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Curable, ethylenically unsaturated compositions based on an ester groups containing compound having excellent fire retardant properties as a result of the incorporation therein of a fire retardant amount of N,N ethylene bis sali cylideneiminato FeII and or the oxidation product derived therefrom. Preferably, use is made of a filler in an amount of 2 to 60 per cent by weight, calculated on the mixture of filler and components taking part in the curing process in the presence of said iron compound of 0,1 to 5 per cent by weight, calculated on the mixture of fire retardant addi tive and components taking part in the curing process. An important group of said ethylenically unsaturated com positions are unsaturated polyester resins which are co polymerized with an unsaturated monomer for use in cast ings, laminated products and other reinforced articles.
