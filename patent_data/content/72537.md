## Abstract
A door handle unit suitable for use in an automobile which handle unit includes a handle arm 8,9 pivotally secured on a door panel 1 with its free end outwardly and retractably extendable through the bottom wall of a recess 3 formed in the door panel, a handle 17 comprising pushing and pulling parts 17a, 17b in its end portions, which handle is pivotally attached to the free end of the handle arm so that the handle may be moved between a fully closing position where the handle covers up the opening of the recess, and an opening position where the desired clearance is established in a part of the opening of the recess, while the free end of the handle arm is settled in the recess, and means 14 which biases the handle toward the fully closing posit tion. When the handle is in the opening position, the clearance permits a driver or passenger to insert his fingers thereinto so that the handle is pulled to open the door. Since the recess is fully covered up while the door is closed, the problems of air resistance and whistling noise have been solved satisfactorily.
