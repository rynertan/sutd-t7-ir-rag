# MOUSE HUMAN CHIMAERIC IMMUNOGLOBULIN HEAVY CHAIN, AND CHIMAERIC DNA ENCODING IT

## Abstract
A mouse human chimaeric immunoglobulin heavy chain comprising a the amino acid sequence of a mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region and b the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region and reacting specifically with human common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen and a chi maeric DNA fragment which encodes the amino acid sequ ence of the above mouse human chimaeric immunoglobulin heavy chain.
