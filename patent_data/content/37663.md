## Description
Method and Apparatus for Positioning Wafers on a Flat Bed This invention relates to methods of, and apparatus for, performing precision operations on the dies of semiconductor wafers. More particularly, the invention relates to methods of, and apparatus for, providing such operations with greater precision and reliability than in the prior art. The field of semiconductors has been rapidly advanced during the past few decades since the development of the semiconductor. For example, the amount of electrical circuitry capable of being provided on a die of a particular size has been progressively decreased.Furthermore, the methods of manufacturing the semiconductor have been considerably advanced and refined.As a result, semiconductors now contain much more sophisticated circuitry, in spite of their significantly reduced size, than the semiconductors of previous years.In spite of this sophistication, the prices now charged for semiconductors is quite low in comparison to prices charged in previous years. The semiconductors are formed on wafers, each of which contains a plurality of dies with electrical circuitry printed on the dies. As the semiconductors have decreased in size and increased in sophistication, it has become progressively difficult to test properly the electrical circuitry on the individual dies on each wafer. A considerable effort has been made to keep pace with the advances in the semiconductor technology in the methods of, and apparatus for, testing semiconductors on the dies of each wafer. However, such efforts have not been entirely successful. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of positioning a plurality of wafers on a flat bed to perform precision operations on the wafer where each of the wafers in the plurality has a plurality of printed dies disposed in at least one row, including the following steps providing a scanning of an image of a particular wafer portion distinctive from portions around the wafer portion and providing an indication of the distinctive quality of such particular portion relative to the portions around the particular portion, providing an indication of the displacement of such particular portion from a starting position on the wafer, providing a scanning of an image of a portion of each wafer adjustable in position and providing an indication of the distinctive quality of such scanned portion, comparing the distinctive quality of the image portion being scanned on each wafer with the distinctive quality of the particular portion, adjusting the position of the wafer to obtain a substantial correspondence between the distinctive qualities of the particular portion and the portion of the image being scanned on the wafer, providing the displacement of the wafer to the starting position, and thereafter performing the precision operations on at least one die on the wafer. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided an apparatus for use in performing the method of the invention, said apparatus comprising a flat bed for holding the wafers first means for scanning a selected portion on the flat bed and for producing signals representative of the image scanned at individual positions in the selected portion second means for indicating the pattern of the signals representative of the image at the individual positions in a distinctive portion on a first wafer serving as a reference third means responsive to the distinctive qualities of the relative patterns of the signals from the first and second means for shifting the position of the flat bed to maximize the coincidence of such distinctive qualities and fourth means responsive to the distinctive qualities of the relative patterns of the signals provided by the first and second means upon progressive shifts of the flat bed in a particular direction for adjusting the flat bed in accordance with such relative patterns to align in the particular direction the dies in the row on the wafer. This invention provides advanced methods of, and apparatus for, performing precision operations on wafer discs such as operations to determine if the circuitry on the dies has been formed in accordance with preselected standards. The invention uses video techniques to obtain such advanced methods and apparatus.Such video techniques provide for the selection of a distinctive area as a preselected reference area and for the use of this reference area in progressively positioning the individual dies on each wafer precisely to test the electrical circuitry on the individual dies on the wafer. As a first step in the method, a distinctive portion of E first wafer is chosen. The distinctiveness of the portitn is verified by visually comparing the distinctive portion to portions intermediate to the distinctive portion and disposed around the distinctive portion. Th. distinctive portion is then compared with progressive portions on the wafer along a particular axis to determine rotary deviations of the wafer from disposition along the particular axis. Corrections are then made in the rotary disposition of the wafer in accordance with such comparisons. The displacement of such distinctive portion from a starting position on the wafer is then determined. Each progressive wafer in the plurality is then sequentially selected for the precision operation.The distinctive portion on each wafer is initially selected and is subsequently confirmed by comparing the distinctive portion with the intermediate portions around the distinctive portion. The distinctive portion is then compared with progressive portions on the wafer along the particular axis to determine any rotary deviations of the wafer from disposition along the particular axis. Corrections are then made in the rotary deviation of each progressive wafer from disposition along the particular axis. Each progressive wafer is then displaced to the starting position. The precision operation is thereafter performed sequentially on the different dies on each progressive wafer and the wafer is advanced to the next one of the progressive dies upon each such completion of such precision operation. Such precision operation may constitute the testing of electrical circuitry on the dies to determine if such circuitry has preselected characteristics. The invention, together with features and advantages thereof, will best be understood from consideration of the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a schematic elevational view of apparatus constituting one embodiment of a system constituting this invention and illustrates in block form certain electrical features of such system Figure 2 is an elevational view schematically illustrating certain additional features of the system constituting this invention Figure 3 is an enlarged fragmentary perspective view of certain of the features shown in Figure 2 Figure 4 is an enlarged fragmentary perspective view, similar to that shown in Figure 3, schematically illustrating the operation of the system of this invention certain steps in the method constituting this invention Figure 5 is a fragmentary elevational view, even more enlarged than Figure 3, of certain features in the system and illustrates in block form certain additional electrical features of the system Figure 6 is an elevational view schematically illustrating an arrangement included in the system of this invention for testing the operability of dies on a wafer after the dies have been properly positioned by the system constituting this invention Figure 7 is an enlarged fragmentary elevational view similar to that shown in Figure 5 and illustrates schematically certain progressive testing operations by the system constituting this invention Figure 8 is a view illustrating a modification in the operation of the system when the dies on the wafer are relatively large and Figure 9 is a view illustrating another embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment of the invention, apparatus is provided for performing precision operations on a plurality of dies 10 which are disposed in rows and columns in a wafer generally indicated at 12. For example, the precision operation may involve the testing of the electrical circuitry on each of the dies to determine if the electrical circuitry has been constructed properly. The embodiment of this invention includes a flat bed 14 for receiving sequentially each of the progressive wafers 12 in the plurality. A precision motor generally indicated at 16 is operatively coupled to the flat bed 14 for driving the flat bed 14 in first and second coordinate directions such as along the X and Y axes. The motor 16 may be constructed in a manner similar to that disclosed and claimed in United StatesPatent No. 3,851,196 issued to Walter E. Hinds onNovember 26, 1974, and assigned of record to GeneralSignal Corporation. The embodiment of this invention further includes a plurality of probes 20. The probes 20 are disposed to engage certain electrical leads printed on each of the dies 10 on the wafer 12. The probes 20 are included in electrical circuitry not shown for testing the electrical characteristics of the electrical circuitry provided on each of the dies 10. If the electrical circuitry on one of the dies 10 is not satisfactory, the testing apparatus may mark with a distinctive color the die being tested. The construction of an assembly of the probes 20 may be in accordance with the disclosure in United States Patent No.3,835,381 issued to Oliver R. Garretson et al onSeptember 10, 1974, and assigned of record to GeneralSignal Corporation. A microcomputer 30 may be included for controlling the operation of the motor 16 in the coordinate directions. For example, the micr.computer may cause the motor 16 to step the flat bed 14 to successive positions in the X direction so that the dies of one row on the wafer 12 may be sequentially tested.After each such step, the microcomputer 30 tay cause the probes 20 to become activated so that a test can be made on the electrical circuitry on the die. After the dies in one row on the wafer 12 have been sequentially tested in this manner, the wafer is stepped to the next row and tests are sequentially made on the dies in that row. The stepping of the wafer 12 to the dies in each successive row is illustrated by a broken line 60 inFigure 7. The stepping of the wafer 12 to the different dies in each row after the stepping of the wafer to that row is illustrated by a broken line 62 in Figure 7. The embodiment of the invention shown in the drawings provides for the precise positioning of the dies 10 on the wafer 12 relative to the probes 20. By precisely positioning each of the dies sequentially relative to the probes 20, tests of the electrical circuitry on the dies more accurate than in the prior art can be made. This is particularly important because the complexity of the electrical circuitry on dies of a particular size have now become so great that tests of the electrical circuitry on the dies will be ineffective, or at least unreliable, unless the dies are precisely positioned relative to the probes 20. A camera 40 is included in the embodiment of this invention. The camera 40 is fixedly positioned above the flat bed 14 to view only a limited portion of the bed. A television monitor 42 is also included in the embodiment of this invention to provide a visual monitor of the image viewed at each instant by the camera 40. The camera 40 and the television monitor 42 can be constructed in a conventional manner. A pattern recognition unit 44 is also included in the embodiment of this invention. The pattern recognition unit may be obtained from View EngineeringCorporation of Chatsworth, California. The pattern recognition unit 44 is connected to the camera 40 to convert the image in the camera into signals having a digital pattern representative of the characteristics of the image at each position being viewed by the camera. Such digital pattern may be binary or decimal or may be in any other form. When such digital pattern is binary, a binary 11100 may represent a white position and a binary 0 may represent a dark position. The pattern recognition unit 44 also processes such digital signals to determine the distinctiveness of the image being viewed by the camera 40 at each instant. In the practice of the invention, a first one of the wafers 12 in a plurality is disposed on the flat bed 14. The flat bed may then be moved manually by a joy stick 48 coupled to the flat bed 14 so that the camera 40 is able to scan different positions on the wafer. The portion of the wafer being scanned by the camera 40 at each instant may comprise an area less than the area of each die on the wafer. The image viewed by the camera 40 is visually presented on the monitor 42. As the flat bed is moved, the monitor 42 is visually scanned by the operator to select on the wafer a portion of the electrical circuitry which is distinctive. The distinctiveness of the scanned portion may result from the distinctive pattern of the electrical circuitry or from the spacings between adjacent dies or from a combination of distinctions in such circuitry and spacings or from other factors . Such a distinctive portion on the wafer 12 is schematically illustrated at 50 in Figure 5. When the distinctive portion 50 of the wafer 12 has been selected, the pattern recognition unit 44 processes the signals representing this distinctive portion and produces an indication of the distinctive quality of this portion. A comparison is then made between this distinctive portion and portions of the image around this distinctive portion. This comparison is made by moving the flat bed 14 so that different portions 52 around the distinctive portion 50 may be visually scanned by the camera 40 and the signals from the camera may be processed by the system 44 to determine the distinctive character of these portions. The portions 52 may be disposed relatively close to the portion 50. The system 44 determines the distinctiveness of the intermediate portions 52 relative to the distinctive portion 50. Preferably the distinctiveness of the intermediate portions 52 should be relatively low in comparison to the distinctiveness of the portion 50. In this way, the distinctive portion 50 on successive ones of the wafers 12 in the plurality will be able to be distinguished easily from the area on the wafer around such distinctive portion. After the distinctive portion 50 has been selected and its distinctiveness has been verified as discussed above, the wafer 12 is adjusted in position so that each row of dies 10 on the wafer is aligned along the X axis. This alignment is accomplished by comparing the distinctive portion 50 with portions on the wafer at progressive positions along the X axis. These progre sive portions are at positions displaced by particular distances from the distinctive portion 50 so that the d stinctive portion 50 should be duplicated.These portions are illustrated at 50a and 50b in Figure 5. If he distinctiveness of the distinctive portion 50 is not substantially duplicated at the displaced positions such as the positions 50a and 50b, this indicates that the wafer 12 is angularly displaced from alignmen of the rows of dies 10 on the wafer with the X axis. Under such circumstances, the flat bed 14 is rotated until the distinctiveness of the portions of the wafer at the displaced positions coincide substantially with the distinctiveness of the distinctive portion 50. By providing such adjustments after tests at progressive positions along the X axis, progressive refinements are made in the rotary disposition of the wafer 12. The tests discussed in the previous paragraph are made by the pattern recognition unit and the microcomputer 44. The system determines the distinctive quality of the image on the wafer 12 at each displaced position and compares this distinctive quality with the distinctive quality of the image in the distinctive portion. If the comparative qualities do not have a substantial identity, the system 30 causes a motor 60 to drive a lead screw 62 which rotates the flat bed 14.As the flat bed 14 is rotated, the system 30 scans different portions of the wafer to establish substantial coincidence in the distinctive quality of these portions in comparison to the distinctive quality of the distinctive portion 50. Although the testing of portions of the wafer at progressive positions along the X axis to align the rows of dies along this axis has been described above, alignment can also be essentially accomplished by making tests of adjacent portions on the wafer or portions considerably displaced from each other such as at opposite ends of the wafer. These opposite ends are preferably aligned along the X axis. However, the alignment of the wafer along the X axis may not be quite as precise by tests at adjacent positions, or even at opposite ends, as the alignment produced from tests at progressive positions along the X axis as described above. After the rows of dies 10 on the wafer 12 have been aligned along the X axis, the joy stick 48 is used to move pattern from the distinctive portion 50 to a starting position on the wafer. This starting position may correspond to the die in the upper left corner of the wafer 12. The joy stick is used to move the wafer to this position. The starting coordinate is stored in a memory in the microcomputer system 30. Successive ones of the wafers 12 in the plurality are then introduced to the flat bed 14. When each of the wafers 12 is introduced to the flat bed, it is at a position approximately corresponding to the position of the distinctive portion 50. As a first step after the introduction of each such wafer to the flat bed 14, the camera 40 scans the wafer 12 and the pattern recognition unit 44 processes the signals representing the image being scanned and determines the distinctive quality of such image. If such distinctive quality does not coincide substantially with the distinctive quality of the distinctive portion 50, the system 30 causes the flat bed 14 to be adjusted in position to locate the distinctive portion 50.The distinctive portion 50 on the wafer is located by obtaining a substantial coincidence between the distinctive quality of the image being scanned by the camera 40 and the distinctive quality of the digital signals stored in the pattern recognition unit 44 to represent the distinctive portion 50 of the reference wafer. After the distinctive portion 50 has been located on each of the wafers 12, tests are made as described above to align the rows of dies 10 on the wafer 12 along the X axis. This is accomplished by comparing the distinctive quality of the distinctive portion 50 on tlle wafer and the distinctive quality of portions of the wafer at different positions along theX axis. If a substantial coincidence in the distinctive quality of the compared portions does not exist, the flat bed 14 is rotated to obtain such a coincidence. Upon an alignment of the rows of dies 10 on each wafer along the X axis, the microcomputer 30 causes the flat bed 14 to be displaced to the starting position.A test of the successive dies 10 on the wafer 12 is then initiated. This test is effectuated by activating the probes 20 and determining the characteristics of the signals produced by the test circuitry when the probes 20 are activated. The flat bed 14 is then moved to the next die 10 and the probes 20 are thereafter activated. The apparatus and methods described above have certain important advantages. They provide for a precise positioning of each wafer before tests on the circuitry on the dies in the wafer are initiated. They further provide for such precise positioning in a minimal amount of time and with a minimal margin for error. The apparatus and method are particularly advantageous because the dies on the wafer are so small and because the apparatus and method amplify, as a practical matter, the distinctive portion 50 of the wafer and use the distinctive characteristics of this portion as a reference to position the successive wafers in the plurality. Sometimes the dies 10 on the wafer 12 are relatively large, as illustrated in Figure 5. Under such circumstances, the area being scanned by the camera 40 is considerably less than the area of each of the dies 10. Under such circumstances, progressive areas are scanned as at 82, 84, 86 and 88 to select a portion which will constitute the distinctive portion 50. As will be seen, each of the portions 82, 84, 86 and 88 preferably includes an individual portion of the die to and may also include a portion of the street between adjacent dies. Such a street is illustrated at 90 in Figure 5. Figure 9 illustrates a method of, and apparatus for, practicing an extension of the invention.In the embodiment of Figure 9, a distinctive portion 100 is selected and located by a camera system 104 in the manner described above. The wafer is then rotated about a preselected fulcrum which may be within the distinctive portion 100 or may be outside of such distinctive portion. The rotation is continued until a distinctive portion 102 is aligned with a pattern prerecorded in the pattern recognition unit. This is accomplished by a camera system 106. In this way, the wafer is positioned to provide the precision operations as described above. Although this invention has been disclosed and illustrated with reference to particular applications, the principles involved are susceptible of numerous other applications which will be apparent to persons skilled in the art.
