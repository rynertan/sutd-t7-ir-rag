## Description
CATHODO LUMINESCENT PHOSPHORS This invention relates to cathodo luminescent phosphors suitable for forming a light emissive coating on the screen of a cathode ray tube. A known cathodo luminescent phosphor is terbium activated yttrium oxy sulphide the EIA Designation of this phosphor isP45, the WTDS Designation is W13 . This material, when subjected to electron bombardment in a cathode ray tube, for example emits white light but, in practice, proves to be rather unsatisfactory since the emission spectrum is based predominantly on two primary colours only blue and green. It is the object of this invention to provide a cathodo luminescent phosphor having improved light emitting properties. Accordingly there is provided a cathodo luminescent phosphor having the chemical composition expressed in atomic proportions , Y3 x y Gdx Pry Ga5 z Alz O12 where 0.0001 y 0.5 0 x 3 y and 0 z 5 The symbols P, Gd, Pr, Ga and Al have their conventional meanings, namely Yttrium, Gadolinium, Praseodymium, Gallium andAluminium respectively. The inventors have discovered that a Praseodymium activated phosphor defined in acoordance with this invention is particularly beneficial since the emission spectrum is based on all three primary colours. In a preferred composition z is not greater than 4.5 and in a particularly useful cotposition z O or z 2.5. In a farther preferred composition x O or x 3 y. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a cathode ray tube wherein the screen is provided with a coating of a cathode luminescent phosphor having a chemical coiposition expressed in atomic proportions Y3 x y Gdx Pry Ga5 z Alz O12 where 0.0001 y 0.5 0 x 3 y and 0 z 5. In order that the invention may be carried readily into effect specific compositions, and their manner of manufacture, are now described in Examples I to VI.Example I Gadolinium Oxide 52.87 gms , Gallium Oxide 46.35 gms ,Praseodymium Oxide 0.84 gms and a flux, Barium Fluoride 5 gis in isopropanol 150 ml were milled fn a ball mill for 19 hrs at 70 r.p.m. The slurry, thus formed, was filtered and the residue dried at 100 C for 2 hrs. and then fired at 1530 C for 16 hrs in a closed alumina crucible. After cooling the formed cake was removed froi the crucible and milled for a further 4 hrs. at 70 r.p.m. with isopropanol 150 ml . The slurry was then washed to remove the flux, dried and the resulting powder sieved BS 53 m mesh and bottled. The approximate yield was 65 g of powder, the formula of which was determined to bePr0.05 Ga5 O12 Example II The procedure of Example I was repeated using, in place ofPraseodymium activated Gadolinium oxide, Praseodymium 1.12g of the oxide activated Yttrium 32.04g and Gadolinium 19.4g oxides and, in place of Gallium oxide, a mixture of Gallium 30.82g and Aluminium 16.82g oxides.The formula of the product was determined to be Y2.15 Gd0.8 Pr0.05 Al2.5 Ga2.5 O12.Example In The procedure of Example I was repeated using, in place ofPraseodymium activated Gadolinium Oxide, Praseodymium 2.095g of the oxide activated Yttrium Oxide 40. 29g together with GalliumOxide 57.67g . The formula of the product was determined to be Y2.9 Pr0.1 Ga5 O12.Example IV The procedure of Example I was repeated using, in place ofPraseodymium Activated Gadolinium Oxide, Praseodymium 6.206g of the oxide activated Yttrium Oxide 37.04g together withGallium Oxide 56.94g . The formula of the product was determined to be Y2.7 Pr0.3 Ga5 012 Example V The procedure of Example I was repeated using in place ofGallium Oxide, a mixture of Gallium 25.69g and Aluminium 14.09g oxides together with Gadolinium Oxide 58.69g andPraseodymium Oxide 1.32g . The formula of the product was determined to be Gd2.93 Pr0.07 Al2.5 Ga2.5 O12.Example VI The procedure of Example I was repeated using GadoliniumOxide 53.63g , Gallium Oxide 46.29g and Praseodymium Oxide 0.083g . The formula of the product was determined to be Gd2.995 Pr0.005 Ga5 O12 It will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to the compositions of Examples I to V and encompasses cathodo luminescent phosphors having the general formula Y3 x y Gdx Pry Ga5 z Alz O12 where 0.0001 y 0.5 0 x 3 y and 0 z 5.Praseodymium activated cathodo luninescent phosphors in accordance with the present invention are found to exhibit particularly useful light emissive properties since the emission spectrum is based predominantly on the three primary colours.The major emissions are found to be 488 nm, 561 nm and 618 nm with relative luminous intensities 100 , 85 and 55 respectively. In contrast, a hithertoknown cathodo luminescent phosphor, Yttrium oxy sulphide, activated with terbium exhibits only two major emissions at 420 nm and 545 nm. A phosphor in accordance with this invention can be used to form the light emissive coating oli the screen of a cathode ray tube CRT or alternatively of a liquid crystal LC cathode ray tube CRn hybrid display. If a colour display is desired an appropriate colour filter can be used in conjunction with theCRT display or the LC CRT hybrid display. LC CRT hybrid displays are described, for example, in SID Digest of TechnicalPapers 1982 by H.C. Clark I.A. Shanks, or SID Digest ofTechnical Papers 1983 by R. Vatne, P.A. Johnson Jr. and B.J. Bos. The phosphor also finds application in the screen of aFlying Spot Scanner for a telecine.
