# Method for producing a weldable austenitic stainless steel in heavy sections.

## Abstract
A method is provided for producing a nickel chromium molybdenum austenitic stainless steel in heavy section sizes and in welded article form substantially free of second phase precipi tation from annealing and welding temperatures. The method includes providing nitrogen additions and annealing at tempera tures of less than 2100 F 1149 C preferably less than 2000 F 1093 C .
