# METHOD AND DEVICE FOR ATTAINING A GAS FLOW IN A WIND TUNNEL

## Abstract
Method and device for attaining a gas flow in a wind tunnel whereby a flow medium, preferably air, is caused to flow from a pressure storage 4 via a turbine 8 to a wind tunnel 9 . The turbine 8 is arranged to drive a fan 18 positioned in the wind tunnel 9 , and a partial flow of the medium flowing in the wind tunnel 9 is deflected from the wind tunnel circuit, whereas the main part is recycled and mixed with the flow being successively fed from the turbine 8 .
