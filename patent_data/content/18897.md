# Method and apparatus for corona charging a moving surface.

## Abstract
Charging of a moving surface of a member to a nominal potential is achieved with low sensitivity to variation in system parameters, such as member capacitance, velocity and or charger efficiency. The surface is subjected first to a corona discharge having a control potential predetermined to overcharge the surface and second subjected to a corona discharge having a control potential predetermined to discharge the surface to the nominal potential.
