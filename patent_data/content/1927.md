# High severity reforming.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for the production of highly aromatic reformates in high yield from a naphtha feed fraction by high severity catalytic reforming using a reforming catalyst which includes a hydrocracking promotor metal. The process comprises reforming the stock under conditions of high severity in a plurality of sequentially arranged reaction zones in which the concentration of the hydrocracking promotor metal of the reforming catalyst is adjusted to provide a minimal hydrocracking activity relative to the other reforming reactions to the catalyst in the first reaction zones, and an enhanced hydrocracking activity to the catalyst in the last reaction zones. The reformates produced according to this process are particularly useful in the blending of high aromatic content gasoline and or in the production of high purity aromatic hydrocarbons.
