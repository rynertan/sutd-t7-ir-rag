TITLE A Tool Holder TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a holder for an elongate tool having a working head portion coaxial with and of greater or smaller cross section than its shank portion. In this Specification the aforementioned elongate tool will be referred to as a tool of the type described .The invention is particularly concerned with, but not restricted to, a holder for drills or small cutting tools having the aforementioned construction. With many industrial operations it is desirable for tools of the type described to be sold, transported, stored and processed while retained in the holder. Difficulties arise in providing these facilities with previously proposed holders, and it is an aim of the invention to alleviate this difficulty. According to the present invention there is provided a holder for tools of the type described, said holder comprising a body having extending therein a plurality of passages to retain the said tools with the head portions projecting from the body, each passage being adapted to receive the tool shank portion and to support the tool, guide means to guide the holder through stations, and engagement means to cooperate with drive means to move the holder through said stations. Each passage may have coaxial portions of greater and lesser cross section the greater cross section portion being adapted to receive the tool shank, and the lesser cross section portion being adapted to receive a tool removal member. The passages may be shaped to facilitate the ready automatic removal and insertion of the tools from and into the holder. This shaping may take the form of chamfers located on the opposite remote ends of the passages. In a preferred embodiment, the holder body may be elongate wifrithe passages spaced along the direction of the body longitudinal axis, with each passage perpendicula r to said longitudinal axis. The guide means may comprise slots, steps or projections extending along opposite longer sides of the body parallel to the said longitudinal axis.The engagement means may comprise teeth, bosses, slots or pegs which are cut into or moulded with the holder body so as to cooperate with a suitable mechanism to move the holder so that each tool may be located in sequence at a required station. In order to reduce the wear of the passage shoulders, wear resistant inserts or bushes may be located on or at these shoulders. If desired, a seating may be located around the upper surface of the holder body to receive a detachable lid.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Referring to Figures 1 to 3, one tool holder of the invention includes a generally rectangular body 2 having longer sides 4 and shorter ends 6. A plurality of tool retaining passages 8 extend through the body 2 between the body upper and lower surfaces 10 and 12. These passages are spaced along the longitudinal axis of the body 2, and the passages are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. Each passage has coaxial portions 14 and 16 of greater and lesser cross section respectively. The cross section of he portion 14 is dimensioned to make a sliding fit with the shank of a drill or like tool retained in the passage.These passage portions 14 and 16 define a shoulder 18 in each passage 8 to support the shank of a drill located in the passage. If desired, bushes or inserts of suitable wear resistant material may be located on these shoulders 18. The portion 16 is adapted to receive a tool removal member which can be inserted therein to remove the tool from the portion 14. The holder is intended for use with drills which are dimensioned so that the heads of the retained drills project from the body upper surface 12. A retained drill may be removed from the holder by gripping the projecting drill head with a suitable tool and pulling out the drill, or preferably by pushing out the drill with a thin removal member pushed through the lower surface 12 into the passage portion 16. In order to assist in the removal and replacement of retained drills chamfers 20 may be provided at opposite ends of the passages 8 which are spaced equidistantly along the body 2. The holder is precision made from a plastics, metal or other solid material, and is intended to hold a plurality of drills or generally similar cutting tools which may be sold, transported, stored and processed while retained in the holder. The holders themselves can be stored in suitable racks which allow easy access and classification of the retained tools. Relevant information about the retained tools may be displayed on the holder, and the holders can be colour coded to simplify selection of the required tools. In addition, the holders may be designed to enable a number of operations to be carried out automatically on the retained tools, such as sor example inspection, cleaning, re sharpening and fitting of location collars. In some applications, it is desirable to transfer the holder and the retained tools between a storage station and one or more operational stations, and to move the holder and the retained tools through the operational stations. To enable this movement to be carried out, teeth 22 are formed in the lower surface 12 of the holder to engage a suitable drive means. Instead of the teeth 22 suitable slots or pegs may be located on or formed in the holder body 2 to engage the drive means. To ensure that the holder moves along a desired path during its movement longitudinal guide slots 24 extend along the body sides 4 to cooperate with associated projections on either side of the selected guide path. The upper portion of the body 2 is recessed to form a circumferential seating 28 for a detachable lid for the body 2. In operation, the holder lid is removed from the seating 28 and drills or similar tools are inserted into. all or some of the passages 8. If desired, the. lid can be replaced. The holder is then stored in a suitable rack, or arranged to cooperate with a suitable drive means to move the holder and the retained tools between a storage station and one or more operational stations, and through the operational stations. In a modified tool holder illustrated in Figure 4, longitudinal projections 26 project from and extend along the sides 4 and 6 to cooperate with suitable guiding means by the side of the selected guide path. The shoulder 18 of each passage 8 is formed by a metal insert 30 located in the body 2. This insert 30 has a tubular passage extending therethrough which constitutes the upper part of the holder passage portion 16. If desired, the insert 30 can also be designed to form the lowsr part of the passage portion 14. In manufacture, the main part of the tcol holder body 2 is moulded round the inserts 30. Rfrring to Figures 5 to 8, another tool holder of the invention includes a generally rectangular body 32 having longer sides 34 and shorter ends 36. A plurality of tool retaining passages 38 extend part way into the body 2 from the body upper surface 40. These passages 38 are spaced along the longitudinal axis of the body 32, and the passages 38 are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body 32. The cross section of each passage 38 is dimensioned to make a sliding fit with the shank of a drill or like tool retained in the passage. The shank of a drill located in the passage 38 is supported by the passage lower end 42. The holder 32 is intended for use with drills which are dimensioned so that the heads of the retained drills project from the body upper surface 40. The operation of this tool holder is the same as the tool holder of Figures 1 to 3. To enable this tool holder to carry out its required movement between and through the appropriate stations, a series of longitudinally spaced transversely extending bosses 44 are located on the lower surface 46 of the tool holder body 32. These bosses 44 project from the body lower surface 46 to engage a suitable drive means. If desired, these bosses 44 may stop short of the body longer sides 34. To ensure that the holder moves along a desired path during its movement, longitudinal guide steps 48 and 50 extend along the body sides 34 to cooperate with associated formations or recesses on either sides of the selected guide path. In a modified version of this tool holder illustrated in Figure 9, each passage 38 extends completely through the body 32 between its upper and lower surfaces 40 and 46. A tubular metal insert 52 is located in the lower region of each passage 38 to define a shoulder 54 and to divide the passage 38 into coaxial portions 56 and 58 of greater and lesser cross section respectively. The passage portion 56 is dimensioned to make a sliding fit with the shank of a drill or like tool retained in the passage portion 56, and the passage portion 58 is adapted to receive a tool removal member which can be inserted therein to remove the tool from the passage portion 56. The shoulder 54 supports the shank of a tool located in the passage portion 56. In manufacture, the main part of the tool holder is moulded round the inserts 52. It will be appreciated that the tool holders illustrated in Figures 5 to 9 are modifications of the tool holders ofFigures 1 to 4, and that all the tool holders disclosed in this Specification have the same general function and operation.
