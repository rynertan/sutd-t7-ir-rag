# Electric lamp having a coloured lamp envelope.

## Abstract
The lamp envelope 1 of the electric lamp is coated at the inner surface with an electrostatically applied light scattering pigmented powder layer 2 . The powder layer comprises at least a cadmium containing pigment and further a cadmium free pigment. Although cadmium free pigments alone cannot give lamps the desired colour properties, it has been found that they are capable of replacing cadmium containing pigments in the powder layer up to a high percentage by weight.
