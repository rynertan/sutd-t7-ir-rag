# Polyester of para hydroxy benzoic acid, 1,2 bis para carboxyphenoxy ethane, terephthalic acid and substituted hydroquinone capable of forming an anisotropic melt which readily undergoes melt processing, and molded articles and fibers based thereon.

## Abstract
A polyester is provided which has been found to exhibit an anisotropic melt phase at a temperature which enables it readily to undergo melt processing to form quality fibers, molded articles, etc. The polyester of the present invention is different in character from earlier polyesters and includes as essential ingredients moieties
