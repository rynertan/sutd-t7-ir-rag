# Position sensor.

## Abstract
A position sensor has a detector 10 having a plurality of sensitive elements 12 which are acted on by indicia 4 of a scale 2 so that each sensitive element detects overlap between itself and one or more indicia 4 of the scale 2 . The outputs of the sensitive elements 12 are modified by weighting values so that there is one position of detector 10 and scale 2 where the sum of the outputs has a unique characteristic. This position can be detected by means analysing the sum of the outputs, and can then detect displacement of scale 2 and detector 10 from that one position. The indicia 4 used have a non uniform pattern, but other indicia 6, 8 with a pitch less than twice but not equal to the pitch of the sensitive elements 12, 14, 16 may be provided to permit interpolation to fractions of the pitch of the sensitive elements. Further interpolation may be pro vided by a register 40 through which signals propagate at a rate which is a multiple of the rate they are received. The register elements modify the signals by weighting values and the sum of the register element outputs is determined.
