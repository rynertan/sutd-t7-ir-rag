# Copying machine suitable for the production of duplex copies from duplex originals.

## Abstract
The copying machine comprises an original transport means having transport paths 9, 10, 16 10, 18, 31 30, 22, 28, 29, 18, 31 for simplex and duplex originals, and at least two copy transport paths for feeding finished copies from the image transfer means 53, 55, 56 to a collection station 68 . One copy transport path 70, 72 being so designed that a duplex copy fed therethrough is delivered to the collection station 68 with the first printed side facing downwards and the other copy transport path 70, 73 being so designed that a duplex copy fed therethrough is delivered to the collection station 68 with the last printed side facing downwards. The copying machine further comprises selecting means S,D₁,D₂,F for selecting the desired type of copies, a detector 37,37A in the original transport path 9 for determining whether an original fed therethrough is simplex or duplex and control means 100 for regulating the transport of copy sheets dependent on the type of originals detected by the detector 37,37A and the type of copies selected with the selecting means S,D₁,D₂,F .
