# Facsimile system and control method therefor.

## Abstract
A facsimile system is so controlled as to reduce four successively scanned source documents and print all four reduced copies on a single copy page. The system prints one of the source documents 44 in each quadrant of the copy document. The images are reduced in the horizontal dimension by discarding every other picture element in the scan image and in the vertical dimension by increasing the speed of the scanner 40 so that the size of the picture element in the vertical dimension is doubled. At the receiv er, two scanned and reduced images will be printed on the left hand half of the copy document 12 . Subsequently, two additional scanned and reduced images are printed on the right hand half of the copy document. When print ing the right hand half of the copy document, the printer is controlled to start printing at the horizontal mid page of the copy document rather than the left hand edge of the copy document.
