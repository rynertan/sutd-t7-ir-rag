# A process for the removal of hydrogen sulfide from gaseous mixtures with strongly basic tertiary amino compounds.

## Abstract
The removal of H₂S gas from a normally gaseous mix ture containing H₂S is accomplished by contacting the mix ture with an absorbent solution comprising a strongly basic acyclic or alicyclic tertiary amino compound having a pK
