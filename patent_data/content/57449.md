# Flexible shaft fan drive.

## Abstract
A flexible shaft 42 driven by a transversely mount ed engine 18 of an automobile 10 and extending rearwardly of the axis 48 48 of the crankshaft of the engine a distance transverse to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and then curving and extending longitudi nally forwardly to the cooling fan 32 used to draw air through the radiator 28 of the vehicle. The engine 18 is mounted in a front wheel drive vehicle 10 and has a pulley 36 mounted on the forward end of the engine driven via a belt 38 from a pulley 40 on the crank shaft of the engine. The pulley 36 in turn rotates the core 54 of the flexible shaft 42 which in turn rotates a shaft 64 used to drive the cooling fan 32 mounted juxtaposition the radiator 28 . Means 58, 60 secure the shaft at each end respectively to the rear end of the pulley 36 and the cooling fan 32 . A gentle sweeping curve is provided from the transverse extending portion of shaft 42 to the longitudinally extending portion. One end of shaft 42 may be driven via an accessory of engine 18 , while the other end may drive the fan through a gear box.
