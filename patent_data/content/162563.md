# BACK UP POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A power supply system has a primary power source S1 which is energized from the mains, and a secondary power source S2 which is a battery and which is to be switched in automatically when the mains power fails, to supply a load L. The two power supplies are connected to the load by means of the emitter collector paths of two respective tran sistors Q1 and Q2. The two transistors have a common base resistor R. Whichever power supply produces the higher volt age turns its transistor on and the other off. This circuit in volves relatively low voltage drops compared e.g. to the use of steering diodes , and is therefore suitable for low voltage supplies, e.g. 3 V.
