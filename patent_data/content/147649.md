# ELECTRONIC SPARK ADVANCE TYPE IGNITION SYSTEM

## Abstract
In an ignition system of an electronic spark advance type including a pickup 1 for generating a pair of position signals indicative of a maximum advance angle W‚ÇÅ in terms of crankshaft rotation degrees for each crankshaft rotation, a signal generating circuit 7, 8, 11, 13 responsive to the output signals of the pickup 1 to generate a pair of comparison signals of different levels within each of the crankshaft rotation degrees of the maximum advance angle and the other crankshaft rotation degrees and a control circuit 12, 14 for comparing the levels of each of the pairs of comparison signals to generate an energization starting position signal and an ignition position signal for respective ly determining the energizatlon and ignition timing of an ignition coil 160 of an internal combustion engine, the control circuit generates the energization starting position signal prior to the timing of generation of earlier one of the next pair of position signals from the pickup 1 and also generates the ignition position signal at a timing within the maximum advance angle thereby ensuring the required energization energy for the ignition coil 160 even during the rapid acceleration of the engine speed.
