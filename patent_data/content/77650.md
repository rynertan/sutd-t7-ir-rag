# CLONING VECTORS

## Abstract
The present invention discloses selectable pairs of recombinant DNA cloning vectors for use in Streptomyces and related organisms. A pair of recombinant DNA cloning vectors comprises a plasmid pEL7, and b a second plasmid that is functionally dependent upon plasmid pEL7, said second plasmid comprising a restriction fragment of plasmid pEL7 and one or more different DNA segments that convey resistance to at least one antibiotic when transformed into a sensitive host cell, said host cell being susceptible to transformation, cell division, and culture.
