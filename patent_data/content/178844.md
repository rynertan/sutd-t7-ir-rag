## Description
This invention relates to apparatus and methods for use with a television receiver that processes a television signal in digital form. Colour television receivers or sets are known in which the majority of signal processing that takes place therein is carried out digitally. That is, a video or television signal is received in a conventional fashion using a known analog tuning circuit and then, following the tuning operation, the received analog television signal is converted into a digital signal and digitally processed before subsequently being converted back to an analog signal for display on a colour cathode ray tube. A colour television set of the above kind is described in an article by Thomas Fischer entitled Schaltungtechnik eines Fernsehgeraetes mit DIGIVISION Circuitry of a television set with DIGIVISION appearing at pages 189 and 190 of FUNK TECHNIK, Vol. 38, No. 5, 1983, Munich, Heidelberg. The set described in the article comprises a central control unit CCU which supplies control and setting values, for example of loudness, colour saturation or frame height, to digital audio and video signal processors. The central control unit comprises a microcomputer and a non volatile memory which is programmed during production of the set with balance values for the chassis and in which the user can store by way of a keyboard or remote control commander desired setting values and desired channels. Although digital signal processing has many advantages over conventional analog signal processing, one problem that is presented by digital signal processing relates to the state of the circuitry at the time immediately following the manufacture of the television set or receiver or following servicing of the set by a repair technician. Although conventional analog components and signal processing elements can be set easily to an appropriate value, such as a midpoint of a range, at the time of manufacture, and such values will be held until adjusted later, digital circuits employing memory units, registers, and so forth do not have any initial settings and, indeed, cannot be set initially in the absence of some sort of digital pre programming source. Examples of some of the various parameters that may be preset in the digital circuitry of a colour television receiver are contrast, brightness, hue, colour saturation degree, white balance and, perhaps most importantly, horizontal and vertical deflections. The problem arises that if the television receiver is turned on before appropriate initial values are set for the above identified parameters, it is quite possible that random or zero values present in the digital memories may be abnormal and outside of tolerable limits. Such abnormal values then would cause adverse influence on appropriate circuit portions. For example, were the horizontal and vertical amplitudes increased or horizontal and vertical oscillation frequencies decreased drastically, there is a good likelihood that the horizontal or vertical output circuits will be destroyed. According to the invention, there is provided, control apparatus for controlling the operation of a television receiver that processes a television signal in digital form under the control of digital data stored in at least one register of the receiver, the control apparatus comprising The invention also provides a method of operating a television receiver that processes a television signal in digital form under the control of digital data stored in a register of the receiver and includes an adjusting controller, the method comprising the steps of The use of such stored predetermined initialisation or initial control data can eliminate or at least alleviate the above noted defects. Specifically, it can prevent circuit portions of the receiver from having undue signal levels and or frequencies impressed thereon as a result of abnormal initial settings. Preferably, memory units associated with one or more microcomputers utilised as part of the receiver are provided to accommodate the desired initial control data. Preferably, the initial control data is selected statistically to be average data and such data is entered at the very first time a power switch of the television receiver is turned on. Such specific data initialisation also can occur following a servicing operation on the receiver. The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like references indicate like elements or parts throughout, and in which A block diagram showing an example of a previously proposed colour television receiver, in which the majority of signal processing is carried out in a digital fashion, is shown in Figure 1. An incoming television signal is received by an appropriate aerial antenna or fed in through a cable to a tuner or tuner section 1 of the receiver. The tuner 1 is only generally represented in Figure 1, because the elements contained therein can be conventional. Assuming that the tuner 1 contains the appropriate circuit elements up to a video detecting circuit, then the tuner 1 will produce a composite video signal Sv, which is converted to a digital signal by an analog to digital A D converter 2. The digitally converted composite video signal is then fed to a comb filter 3 which produces an output signal which is fed to a digital high pass filter 4 which separates a digital luminance signal Y As in a conventional analog television receiver, the composite video signal from the tuner 1 is fed also to a sync separator 14 which produces a sync pulse signal which is fed to a horizontal sync pulse processor or processing circuit 15H, in which it is converted to a horizontal sync pulse P In modern television receivers, specifically in modern digital signal processing television receivers, it is known to utilise an internal microcomputer or similar unit for selecting the television channel and for controlling the overall operation of the television set. Thus, in the present example, a microcomputer 19 is provided to control the tuner 1 to select a desired channel and another microcomputer 20 is provided for control of the overall television receiver. Inputs for the desired television channel and other functions and operating modes of the television receiver are provided to the microcomputer 19 by a key panel or keyboard 24, which may comprise a remote control unit or be a bank of switches on the front of the receiver. Typically, the keyboard 24 is provided with a plurality of keys or buttons by means of which the user can select a channel for viewing and can adjust the contrast, brightness, hue, colour saturation degree and the like of the picture being displayed. A non volatile memory 21 is provided in association with the microcomputer 19, so that the various values of contrast, brightness, hue, colour saturation and the like that have been selected using the key board 24 are retained, even after the power switch of the television receiver is turned off, thereby precluding the necessity to reset all of these various parameters each time the television receiver is operated anew. The values stored in the non volatile memory 21, which of course is rewritable because the various values may be altered by use of the keyboard 24, are better thought of as offset values that represent differences from respective standard values for these various picture parameters. The standard values for the parameters, such as contrast, brightness, hue, colour saturation degree, and the like, are stored in a separate non volatile memory 23. Also stored in the memory 23 are other data, such as data relating to white balance, horizontal deflection, vertical deflection, and so on, which need not be adjusted by the user but must, of course, be adjusted by the manufacturer at the time the set is fabricated and also, possibly, by a service technician if the receiver requires servicing. The data that is to be stored in the memory 23 is adjusted by means of an adjusting commander 26, which may be connected temporarily at a terminal 25 to the microcomputer 20 when manufacture and assembly of the set has been completed. Thus, when the main power switch of the television receiver of Figure 1 is turned on, the microcomputer 19 operates to read from the memory 21 the channel selection data, which had been selected prior to the time that the power switch of the receiver was turned off. This data then is supplied to the tuner 1 to reselect the channel previously selected before the receiver was turned off. Additionally, the microcomputer 19 reads the data of the various offset values relating to brightness and the like from the non volatile memory 21 and supplies such data through an interface unit 29 to the microcomputer 20. The microcomputer 20 reads also the data relative to the brightness, white balance, and horizontal and vertical deflection from the memory 23, which data then is supplied through a bus 22 and an interface unit 27 to an amplifier control circuit 11. The amplifiers 11R, 11G, and 11B then are controlled by the amplifier control circuit 11 so that the three primary colour signals red R , green G , and blue B are adjusted appropriately to establish the brightness and white balance, as determined by the standard values retained in the memory 23. Furthermore, the microcomputer 20 reads from the memory 23 the horizontal and vertical deflection data and supplies such data through a further interface unit 28 to the sync pulse processors 15H and 15V, respectively, which act to adjust the horizontal and vertical deflections to the standard values as retained in the memory 23. Accordingly, it will be seen that the microcomputer 20 reads the data representing standard values of contrast, hue, colour saturation degree, horizontal and vertical deflection and the like from the memory 23. Then, the data representing the offset values and the data representing the standard values are added to each other and the summed data supplied through the interface unit 27 to the signal processors 5Y and 5C, in which the signals Y The keyboard or key panel 24 may include numerous buttons or keys and, when the user operates such keys, the microcomputer 19 reads from the memory 21 the data relating to the selected channel that previously has been set in the memory 21 in accordance with the operated key. Typically, ten keys are provided for channel selection. This data then is fed to the tuner 1 so that it is placed in the channel selection state as designated by the appropriate keys of the key panel 24. At that same time, the data corresponding to the selected channel is written in the memory 21, in anticipation of the time when the power switch will be turned off, so that, when the receiver is turned back on, this channel will be selected. As a further example, each time that the hue key on the key panel 24 is depressed, the data relating to the offset value of the hue data stored in the memory 21 is updated, and this updated, offset data then is supplied through the interface unit 27 to the appropriate signal processor, which in this case is the chrominance signal processor 5C, which then adjusts the hue of the displayed picture accordingly. Typically, in colour television receivers of this kind, a display circuit is provided, and in the example of Figure 1 a display circuit 30 is used to display the selected channel on the screen of the colour cathode ray tube 13 upon channel selection. Such display circuits frequently also are used to display the sound or audio volume level each time such volume is adjusted. Channel data and sound volume data for use by the display circuit 30 are provided by the microcomputer 19 through the microcomputer 20. Thus, the display circuit 30 produces red R Concerning the general techniques involved in manufacturing television receivers of the type shown typically in Figure 1, the portions of the circuit diagram shown in Figure 1 that are enclosed by single dot chain lines typically are each formed on one integrated circuit chip. These chips then are used to fabricate commercial television receivers. One source for these chips is the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation ITT and, in that regard, attention is directed to the brochure DIGIT 2000 VLSI Digital TV System published by ITT. In the receiver of Figure 1, the data stored in memory 23 is read out therefrom by the microcomputer 20 each time that the power switch of the television receiver is turned on. Then, in accordance with that data, the respective signal processors 5Y and 5C, the pulse processors 15H and 15V and so on are preset initially or stated another way, are initialised. This situation poses no problem because, once the initially preset data is contained in the memory 23, it can be read out appropriately each time that the power switch of the receiver is turned on. Nevertheless, there is a serious problem when the power switch of the television receiver is turned on in the adjusting mode when there is no initially preset data in the memory 23. This situation can occur at the time that the standard value data is to be written into the memory 23 by the adjusting commander 26, that is, at the time that manufacture of the set finally has been completed. In other words, at the time when the power switch of the receiver is first turned on in the adjusting mode there is nothing stored in the memory 23 or, if anything is stored there, it is only random data, so that the values of the respective circuit parameters may well be, and quite frequently are, set at abnormal, non functional values. This then raises the serious question that an undue influence can be exerted upon the respective circuit portions and seriously damage such circuits. For example, if the horizontal and vertical amplitudes are caused to be increased by such abnormal data, or if the horizontal and vertical oscillation frequencies are drastically decreased by such random or abnormal data, there is a very real chance that the horizontal output circuit and vertical output circuit could be destroyed. Embodiments of the present invention that will now be described provide systems for preventing or minimising any possibility that the various circuit elements or circuit sections of the receiver will be damaged by such abnormal pre initialisation values that might be contained within the various digital memories and registers in the system. Figure 2 shows an embodiment in which a read only memory ROM 20A and a random access memory RAM 20B are provided as part of the microcomputer 20. Moreover, in this embodiment, a part of the read only memory 20A is provided as a storage region 31 in which average initial setting data, that corresponds to each of the various data points that ultimately are to be stored in the memory 23, previously has been written and retained. The data stored in the region 31 of the ROM 20A cannot be rewritten and is selected to be common to each set or receiver of a specific kind, that is to all models within a specific model line. In this embodiment, the circuit of Figure 2 is operated in accordance with a selected method represented by a routine shown in the flow chart of Figure 3. Referring to Figure 3, after the power switch of the television receiver is turned on, as represented in a step S100, it is determined in a step S110 whether the adjusting mode is present or not. For example, when the adjusting commander 26 is connected at the connector 25 of the microcomputer 20, it is determined or judged that the television receiver is in the adjusting mode. If the receiver is judged to be in the adjusting mode, the method proceeds to a step S120, in which an adjusting flag is raised to indicate that the adjusting mode is present, and then to a step S130, in which the average, initial, standard data for each circuit portion, which has been stored in the region 31 of the ROM 20A, is read out therefrom and set in each of the respective circuit portions of the receiver. When such data has been read out completely from the section 31 of the ROM 20A, the method moves to a step S140 at which it is determined or judged whether a remote control signal is being transmitted from the adjusting commander 26. If such remote control signal is being transmitted from the adjusting commander 26, then each circuit portion is adjusted appropriately and the data for each of the circuit portions is written into the memory 23. This writing of the data into the memory 23 occurs at a step S150. Once the adjusted data has been written into the memory 23 the method proceeds to a step S160 at which it is judged whether the television receiver remains in the adjusting mode. Releasing of the adjusting mode may be accomplished by operating an adjusting end key, for example, an EXIT key typically is provided on the adjusting commander 26, whereby the adjusting mode flag is turned off and the adjusting mode is released. If the adjusting mode is determined to be released, the method moves to a step S170 at which the data that was written in during the adjusting mode is read out from the memory 23 and such data then is set in each circuit portion appropriately. On the other hand, if the adjusting mode is judged not to be released, then the step S160 indicates that the step S140 and the subsequent steps are to be repeated. The steps schematically depicted in Figure 3 are given by way of example only and, of course, other embodiments of this method could be provided following the teaching of the foregoing disclosure to accommodate forms of digital television receivers that differ from the example of Figure 1. According to the embodiment described above, when the power switch of the television receiver is turned on in the adjusting mode, the average initial values that are set into the respective parts of each of the circuit portions are those corresponding to the data that previously had been stored in the region 31 of the ROM 20A. Accordingly, even if the initial set data is not already written in the memory 23, no circuit section ever can be set to an abnormal value and there is little or no possibility that any circuit section can be damaged or destroyed. Another embodiment of the present invention is represented by the block diagram of Figure 4, which shows only portions of the television receiver. In the embodiment of Figure 4, a non volatile memory 32, which contains average predetermined set data corresponding to the data written into the memory 23, is arranged outside of the microcomputer 20 and is connected to the data bus 22. Thus, in this embodiment, when the power switch of the television receiver is turned on in the adjusting mode, the average initial set data of the respective circuit sections is derived from this external non volatile memory 32, instead of from the fixed portion 31 of the internal ROM 20A, and then is set into each circuit section appropriately. It will be clear that in accordance with the embodiment of Figure 4, the exact same operation and effects are possible as those described above in relation to Figure 2 following the method depicted in Figure 3.
