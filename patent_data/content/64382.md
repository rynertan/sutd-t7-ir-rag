# SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE FILTER

## Abstract
A surface acoustic wave filter comprises a substrate of piezoelectric material a multistrip coupler comprising a plurality of parallel conductive strips formed on said subs trate at least one input transducer disposed on one side of said multistrip coupler and at least one output transducer disposed on the other side of said multistrip coupler. A part of the middle portion of each of said conductive strips of said multistrip coupler is made of a photo conductive material. This can provide a switchable or adjustable surface acoustic wave filter.
