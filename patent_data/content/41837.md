# Process for the purification of p aminophenol.

## Abstract
A process for the recovery and extractive purification of p aminophenol involving contacting an aqueous feed solu tion prepared by catalytic reduction of nitrobenzene in acid medium and containing 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether, aniline and other minor amine by products with a base to adjust the pH of the solution to 4.0 5.0, and then extracting the resulting aqueous feed solution with a mixture of aniline and toluene to selectively dissolve 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether in the aniline toluene mixture and to produce an aqueous phase containing principally p aminophenol and an organic aniline toluene phase containing p aminophenol, 4,4 diamino diphenyl ether and other amine by products. The ratio of aniline to toluene is within the range between approximately 4 parts by volume aniline to 1 part by volume toluene and approximately 1 part by volume aniline to 4 parts by volume toluene, preferably a ratio of 1 1. The volume ratio of aniline toluene to aqueous feed solution is 0.05 to 1 1, a ratio of 0.2 1 being preferred. After separation of the aqueous phase from the organic phase, the purified p aminophenol is recovered from the aqueous phase. The remaining organic phase may, preferably, be sub jected to back extraction by the addition thereto of a potassium or sodium hydroxide solution in excess to obtain an aqueous layer of a pH of more than 12. This aqueous solution can be used to recover p aminophenol by neutra lisation, or to adjust the pH of the original aqueous feed solution to a pH of 4.0 5.0. In lieu of back extracting the organic phase with a solution of potassium or sodium hydroxide, the organic phase may also be back extracted with an ammonium sulfate solution to achieve a greater overall yield of p aminophenol. The process may also be carried out by a fractional countercurrent extraction of the aqueous feed solution containing p aminophenol and the above mentioned im pureties and having a pH of between 4.0 and 5.0 with an aniline toluene mixture and an ammonium sulfate solution, aniline sulfate or sulfuric acid. The 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether is again selectively extracted into the aniline toluene mixture.
