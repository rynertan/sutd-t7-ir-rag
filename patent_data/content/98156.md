# Dynamic semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A dynamic semiconductor memory device of an open bit line type comprises a plurality of first wiring lines running on common opposite electrodes for forming opposite elec trodes of memory cell capacitors and connected to the common opposite electrodes at a number of contact points and a second wiring line connected to the first wiring lines at their ends and connected to a voltage supply line at the center point of the second wiring line whereby the potential distribution of the common opposite electrodes can be equalized.
