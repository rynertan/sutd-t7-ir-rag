# High efficiency recuperative furnace.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the conversion of a substantially conventional gas fired furnace utilizing two or more of the clam shell type heat exchanger cells, which is modified by converting one cell to a final stage counterflow heat exchanger for the hot gases of combustion from the fired cells in a counterflow path through the non fired cell by utilizing a positive displacement fan and then exhausting the gases of combustion. The modification eliminates the need for posi tive venting, while substantially increasing the operational efficiency of the furnace unit. The normal flue gas tempera ture in this type of furnace will be about 232 C while with the modification, the temperature will be reduced to less than about 93 C and efficiency will be increased by greater than 10 percent.
