## Description
COLLAGES CONTACT LENS This invention provides a soft contact lens comprising a collagen gel in which the collagen gel is prepared from fiber collagen, or from a mixture of fiber collagen with solubilized collagen. More specifically according to one aspect the invention provides a soft contact lens comprising a lens shaped, subsequently crosslinked aqueous gel of defatted fiber collagen, said gel comprising 1.0 to 30.0 wt. collagen. According to another aspect the invention provides a soft contact lens comprising a lens shaped, subsequently crosslinked aqueous gel of a mixture of defatted fiber collagen and defatted solubilized collagen, said gel comprising 1.0 to 30.0 wt. collagen. Generally the lens consists only of collagen and water. Collagen constitutes about 20 to 30 per cent of the total body protein in vertebrates. It is a fibrous protein and functions primarily as a supporting tissue and scaffolding for other proteins and cells. It is present throughout the body but exists in high concentrations in skin, tendon and bone. Collagen is recovered from these tissues by a variety of techniques the oldest known method being the boiling of the tissue in water which denatures sone of the collagen and forms the well known gelatin on cooling.For use as a biomaterial however, collagen must be recovered in native, undenatured form, i.e., with little or no destruction of the basic rigid triple helical structure tropocollagen . Undenatured native collagen is recovered principally by two methods, a solution by dissolving the collagen in acids, bases, salts or by enzyme digestion in which instances the collagen becomes actually dissolved, and b extraction in solid, undissolved, fiber form usually by the action of aqueous salt on minced, comminuted collagen raw material to produce a dispersion from which the solid is recovered by centrifuging, etc. Both the solution and extraction methods are well described in the collager art. The chemistry, molecular structure and biochemical properties of cellagen have been well established. An up to date review article AnnualReview of Biophysics and Bioengineering, Van1. 3, p 231 253, 1974 contains an excellent compilation of references on the subject. Contact lenses have been known as a commercial product for over 25 years Contact lenses to date have been made from chemically synthesized materials which do not occur in nature. For example, most early contact lenses were made from polymethyl methacrylate or chemical modificatlons thereof, from hydroxy ethylmethacrylate, from cellulose acetate butyrate, from silicones, etc. To the knowledge of the inventors no lens, prior to their own inventions, was made from naturally occurring animal materials and especially from materials having physiological and immunological properties possessed by constituents of the eye itself, e.g., the cornea The state of the art on contact lenses is reviewed in a current article A Contact Lens Update11 Contact Lens Forum, p. 16 23 May 1976 . In our prior United Kingdom Patent Specification No. 1 568 136 there is described a collagen gel contact lens in which the collagen is made from reconstituted, solubilized telopeptide poor, defatted collagen, particularly enzyme solubilized collagen. The inventors have now discovered that a soft contact lens of improved strength and improved resistance to bacteria attack is produced from purified fiber collagen, and from fiber collagen solubilized collagen mixtures. The above improved properties are of great value when producing extended wear disposable lenses. The preferred fiber collagen is fiber collagen made from beef leg tendon, while the preferred solubilized collagen for use in mixtures therewith is of the enzyme solubilized type. Tendon collagen is relatively purer and more resistant to decomposition in that it is by nature more firmly cross linked while enzyme solubilization produces greater yields of extracted collagen and at the same time digests telopeptides and other undesirable bodies such as mucopolysaccharides, saccharides and other contaminating proteins. The inventors have found that fiber collagen and fiber coiiagen solubilized collagen gel mixtures appear to have greater resistance to bacteria than s√≥lubilized collagen ,,els alone. The difference, which is of great importance when such gels are formed into contact lenses for human use, is believed to be due to the greater extent of cross linking of the native fiber collagen molecule and its resistance to decomposition when exposed to the rigors of additional crosslinking whether conducted by radiation or by chemical means. The inventors have frequently found that if the crosslinking by radiation is too severe the resulting collagen gels and lenses made therefrom are susceptible to bacteria growth thereon or in some cases to liquefaction or destruction by bacteria.It is believed that breakages in the linkages of the triple helix structure of the collagen molecule occur under too severe irradiation crosslinking conditions and provide sites that are susceptible to the action of proteolytic enzymes of bacterial origin. When describing the collagens as purified, we mean to imply that the collagens prior to conversion to viscous solutions, are treated, either during their recovery stage or thereafter, for the removal of telopeptides, saccharides, mucopolysaccharides and other contaminating proteins. In addition the recovered collagens should be relatively free of lipids and fats, and this is achieved preferably by subjecting them to de lipid and defatting solvents. Most animal collagen, of whatever type, contains at least small amounts of fats, and we make no distinction in the use herein of the terms defatted, fat free or fat poor. When making collagen lenses from mixtures of fiber collagen and solubilized collagen the amounts of each present in the collagen mixture is not critical. The ratio of fiber to solubilized collagen may vary from 10 to I to 1 to 10 however, we prefer mixtures in the 40 60, 60 40 wt. 96 ranges. RECOVERY OF COLLAGENS FROM CRUDE SOURCE The method of obtaining solubilized or fibril collagens from the crude collagen source, e.g. skin, tendon, hide, etc., is not critical, and some flexibility may be used in the selection of the particular tissue and the method applied thereto for examole, we prefer enzyme extraction when preparing solubilized collagen regardless of the nature of the tissue. A Solubilized Collagen The greater part of native collagen is insoluble, but can be eolubilized in dilute acids, e.g. acetic acid in bases e.g. NaOH and in dilute aqueous salts, e.g. Nail. In all, relatively low yields are obtained. All these processes are well known in the collagen extraction art. Since we prefer enzyme extraction as the better method of obtaining solubilized collagen for our mixed collagen gel lenses, this extraction process will be described in more detail than the others. i3 Acid extraction Collagen tissue of young animal such as calfskin contains about 1 2 acid. soluble collagen. This collagen is extracted by pH 2 4 aqueous acid solution such as 0.1 acetic acid or 0.15M citrate buffer pH 3.6 But this is not economical because the yield of collagen is so small. ii Base extraction Corium layer of hide is soaked in 4 NaOH containing 0.2M monomethylamine and 15 sodium sulfate for 10 15 days at room temperature.The hide is washed with water. to remove bases and then extracted by stirring in 0.1 N acetic acid 0.1 M Nail, pH 2.8. Almost all the hide is dissolved and a viscous solution is obtained. This collagen is precipitated by raising the pH to 4 5, collected by centrifugation and washed with water. After dehydration with ethanol, the collagen is treated with ethanol ether 1 1 to remove fat. After air drying, collagen is dissolved in an acidic aqueous solution, pH 2 4, and filtered through millipore filters up to 0.65,cepore size. The collagen is precipitated at pH 45 and collected by centrifugation. Finally 440 collagen gels in acidic aqueous medium, pH 2 4 are prepared for lens production. iii Salt extraction Collagen can be extracted from tissue by treatment with salt solutions, e.g. dilute aqueous NaCI, but the yields are poor as in the case of acid extraction, and this procedure is not recommended. iv Enzyme extraction For reasons previously mentioned enzyme extraction is the preferred method for recovering collagen by the solution process. Cleaned, de haired hide or skin is cut into pieces of workable size and slurried in acidified water in the presence of a proteolytic enzyme other than collagenase . Suitable enzymes are pepsin, trypsin, pronase, proctase, etc. Two fractions are obtained from this digestion, one an insoluble solid fraction which is discarded, and a solution or soluble fraction which is worked up as follows. The solution is brought to a pH of about 10.0 to denature the remaining active enzyme, and then neutralized to a pH of about 6.0 7.0. ZAtelocollagen precipitates at this pH leaving behind in solution to be discarded the digested telopeptides, and other contaminating proteins, and any saccharides, mucopolysaccharides, etc.The atelocollagen is usually further purified by repeated solubilization at pH 2 3 and reprecipitation at pH 6 7. The recovered collagen is then washed with ethanol to remove any lipid content and excess water in preparation for the solvent defatting process The collagen is defatted by treatment with 1 1 ethanol ethyl ether mixture and recovered as a viscous solid usually by cheesecloth filtering. It is then air dried, and subsequently converted to gel by solubilization in acidified water at a pH of about 3.0.. B Fiber Collagen Native collagen is also recovered in fiber form not dissolved at all by dispersion of the collagen in an aqueous medium and recovery by some means such as centrifuging, etc. Fiber collagen is usually recovered from animal tendon or hide as opposed to skin or bone source. Tendon, e.g., is desheathed, sliced and homogenized to separate individual tendon fibers in specialized micro cut machines. Water is present during the machining of the tendon and the fibers become dispersed therein. The dispersion is repeatedly 2 or 3X washed with dilute salt solution 5 NaCI and th collagen fibers recovered by centrifuging. The fibers are washed with water to remove salt preparatory to enzyme treatment.The dispersion is treatea with pancreatin, an enzyme which is very effective in dissolving elastin which encircle the fibers and binds them together. Other undesirable components, as mentioned above, are alsr, digested during this enzyme treatment which is carried out for about 24 hours at room tempere. ure at pH of about 7 8 and enzyme concentration of 0.5 wt 96 based on the weight of dry collagen. After recovering the collagen fibers by centrifuge, the fibers are washed with dilute aqueous salt solution and finally with water after which they are defatted. The product is recovered from the defatting solvent, dried in air, powdered and swollen at 1 3 concentrations in dilute HCl or citric acid pH about 2 3 .For conversion of the fibers to finer collagen fibrils from which lenses are eventually made, the fibers are homogenized by mortar action, whereupon they become homogenous and transparent, and the product is a clear, viscous pourable dispersion. Hide collagen is worked up in the same manner as tendon collagen to produce fibers therefrom, but in doing so it is recommended that the hair side and flesh side be cut away and only the corium layer used. Fiber collagen possesses high tensile strength and its high degree of natural crosslinking makes it easier to purify without degradation, particularly, during enzyme treatment wherein a milder acting enzyme is used and in any finishing crossiinking operation. Practically all sources of animal collagen, whether young calf or older animals, contain more or less quantities of fats and lipid materials which should be removed before a transparent collagen gel suitable for lens production can be obtained. Most fatty materials are preferably physically removed from the animal source, e.g. hide, tendon, etc. by cutting or scraping before the solubilization or extraction process is initiated. This procedure cuts down on the extent of the fat solvent extraction step required in the subsequent processing. Fats and lipid materials should be removed to the extent that they interfere with transparency of the collagen gel.In general, any steps taken to minimize the costly and sometimes hazardous solvent extraction process is encouraged however when referring to collagen gels as fat poor we mean to include all collagen gels whether prepared from fat poor raw collagen materials, or whether resulting from fat and lipid physical or chemical extraction processes, however mild or severe, and conducted at any s age prior to the gel shaping and crosslinking. Coll ,7en solubilized or fiber contains many NH2 and COOH groups in its structure and chemical modifrations of the molecule can be readily made, e.g., all or some of the amino groups may be acylated by reaction with a mixture of acetic anhydride and acetic acid, or other anhydride such as succinic anhydride. All or some of the carboxyl groups contained in the molecule may be esterified by the standard reaction with acidified alcohol, preferably a water soluble aliphatic alcohol, such as methallol, ethanol, etc.In the above reactions the isoelectric point of collagen can be controlled, either negative or positive, or completely neutralized. Excellent soft contact lenses have been made from collagens which have been succinylated and methylated prior to crosslinking. Gels having collagen concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 wt. can be utilized for fiber or fiber solubilized collagen lens production, but the preferable concentration is 1 to 20 with the balance being water. In general gels made from fiber collagen exhibit greater physical strength characteristics than gels made from solubilized collagens of the same collagen concentrations.. Therefore fiber collagen gel lenses can be made with lower collagen concentrations and higher water contents without risking loss of desired properties. As the collagen content of the gel increases substantially above about 15 20 , the material becomes gummy and difficult to handle and work. A collagen soft contact lens of higher water content is more pliable, superior in oxygen diffusion, and more comfortable to wear. However . in general the mechanical strength of the lens is improved with decreasing water content. CROSSLINKING Crosslinking of the solubilized transparent collagen is necessary to stabilize the molecule. Crosslinking is accomplished, e.g., by irradiation with gamma or ultraviolet rays preferably in the presence of a nitrogen atmosphere or by heating, drying or simple ageing. Nitrogen atmosphere is preferred to aii because the presence of nitrogen increases the crosslinking of collagen while maintaining the rate of tleakdown of collagen at a low level. Crosslinking can also be accomplished by treating with pertain chemicals such as aldehydes, e.g., formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, glyoxal, acrolein, dialdehyde starch, or with tanning acids such as chromic acid. The mechanism of crosslinking of collagen is well known and has been fairly well documented.In the preparation of soft contact lenses in accordance with this invention, the preferred crosslinking method depends on the type of collagen being crosslinked. Irradiation is preferred to chemical treatment in certain cases since the irradiation process introduces no potentially toxic foreign material into the collagen gel structure. The effectiveness of gamma irradiation is a function of the collagen concentration of the gel, the atmosphere in which the irradiation is carried out and the irradiation dose. For example, gamma irradiation in presence of air induces some damage of the collagen molecule believed to be destruction of the bonds in the triple helix concurrent with introduction of crosslinkages. Irradiation in the presence of nitrogen minimizes such destruction, and enhances gel stabilization by crosslinking. The optimal irradiation dose depends on the collagen concentration. Irradiation of 500900 K rads at a dose rate of 82 K rads per hour is suitable to introduce enough crosslinkages into 5 collagen gel however, a dose of 1200 1600 K rads is generally required for 10 collagen gel in presence of nitrogen. Chemically modified collagens can also be used as a fibril or solubilized collagen lens material as well as native collagen without chemical modification . Since native collagen is soluble at acidic pH a clear gel is obtained only below about pH 4.O Lens material made from this gel must be neutralized. On the other hand, chemically modified collagen such as succinylated collagen, or methylated collagen is soluble under physiologic conditions pM 6 8 and neutralization of the lens material is not necessary.The effect of crosslinking is similar on native and chemically modified collagens. When crosslinking by irradiation, the irradiation is carried out preferably in the lens mold simultaneously with the molding forming of the molded lens. When chemical crosslinking means are employed the crosslinking may be carried out during the lens shaping process. For example, collagen gel of pH 6.2 is de aerated by centrifugation 4000 rpm for 60 minutes . The crosslinking agent, e.g., 10 acrolein solution, 0.1 M citrate, pH 6.2 was mixed with the gel at a collagen to acrolein ratio of l vs. 0.067 on a dry basis. The material was again de aerated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for about 10 20 minutes. The de aerated gel was then shaped into lens form and permitted to react slowly for about 16 hours in a cold room and finally 10 hours at room temperature.Excess crosslinking agent was removed by washing the lens with 0.1. M citrate solution, pH 6.2 with a phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and finally with saline solution. NOVEL POLYMER CONTAINING LENS It has now been found that superior lens can be made which consists of a lens body comprising collagen gel to which is added variable amounts, not more than fifty percent, of at least one water soluble, organic polymer, the gel thereafter being shaped and subsequently cross linked. This technique is applicable to both types of coilagen gels, viz.solubilized or fiber or mixtures thereof. It has now been discovered that lenses of improved physical strength and of improved biological stability i.e. resistance to bacterial attack may be prepared from collagen gels to which has been added at least one watersoluble, organic preferably polyhydroxy polymer, such as mucopolysaccharides, polyvinyl alcohols, polyhydroxyalkyl methacrylates, carboxy methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carboxy vinyl polymers, etc.The polymer is generally added to the collagen gel in an amount from 1.0 to 100 of the weight of collagen in the gel. Preferred additives are the mucopolysaccharides such as chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, etc. which are available commercially in relatively pure state. The preferred concentration of the additive varies with the particular additive, but generally falls within 5 to 50 of the weight of ccllagen in the gel. It is well known that native collagen is relatively free from attack by most enzymes except under certain conditions. An exception is the enzyme collagenase which is capable of reducing collagen to polypeptides. It is important therefore to render the collagen gel as resistant as possible to decomposition. Crosslinking of the gel goes a long way toward the physical strengthening of the molecular structure and at the same time stabilizes the lens against proteolytic enzyme attack. Additional stability is provided by protecting the collagen molecule with the addition thereto of the watersoluble, organic polyhydroxy polymers of this invention. Bacteria produce a variety of enzymes that could digest collagenous materials. The most active of these is Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. It has been known that a human cornea infected with this bacteria can be destroyed in a matter of hours, absent prompt discovery and expert treatment. The effects of incubating collagen lenses in a dense suspension of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa strain is used, therefore, to estimate the stability of the lens to proteolytic attack. In these tests concentrations of bacteria zaire used far in excess of that which the lens could possibly encounter in normal human experience. Practically all collagen lens, properly prepared and cross linked, even when exposed to the dense concentrations of the strain have exhibited far greater resistance than that reported for human cornea resistance. We do not know the mechanism by which the additives of this aspect of the invention produce their results, but it is believed that the additive surround the strands of the collagen molecules and protect them from attack by micro organisms.. It has been found that the conditions of crosslinking are highly important in producing collagen gel lenses having optimum biological properties. It has been found that under too severe conditions during the crosslinking process, e.g. excessive amounts of irradiation or too lengthy irradiation, certain breaks in the collagen triple helix structure occur and these possibly become nucleating sites for the growth of enzyme producing bacteria which subsequently attack the collagen molecule and result in the liquefaction of the gel.It is possible that our additives prevent the occurrence of such breaks, or, if they do occur, prevent them from becoming sites susceptible to the action of proteolytic enzymes of bacterial origin. Gels suitable for use in the preparation of collagen lenses of this aspect of the invention may be prepared from solubilized collagen, from fiber collagen and from mixtures thereof. The preferred gel is one made from enzyme stabilized collagen which has been treated for removal of fats and lipid bodies and which is poor in telopeptides and relatively free of other contaminating proteins, saccharides, etc. When mixtures of solubllized collagen and fiber collagen are used to prepare the gel, the ratio of solubilized collagen to fiber collagen is not critical and may range from 10 to l to 1 to 10 however, mixtures in the range of 50 50 are preferred. In its preferred form this aspect of the invention provides a soft contact lens comprising a body of lens shaped subsequently cross linked aqueous collagen gel, said gel having a concentration of 1.0 to 30 wt. 96 collagen and 0.1 to 30 wt. 96 of a wator soluble, organic polymer. Generally the gel consists only of collagen, polymer and water. Further preferred features. are as follows 1. The gel is enzyme solubilized collagen. 2. The lens shaped gel is chemically cross linked. 3. The lens shaped gel is cross iinked in two stages utilizing irradiation in one stage and chemical treatment in the other. 4. The gel contains 1.0 to 25 wt. of mucopolysaccharide. 5. The lens shaped gel is crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. 6. The gel contains 1.0to125 wt. 96 of polyvinyl alcohol. 7. The lens shaped gel is cross linked by treating with acrolein in two stages. Crosslinking of the lens shaped collagen gel containing the additive of this aspect of the invention may be carried out by irradiation with gamma or ultraviolet rays or by chemical means, or by a combination of both. We have found that the chemical method is susceptible to closer control of crosslinking conditions, and contrary to former belief, is preferred to irradiation. When irradiation is used, gamma rays or ultraviolet light , the treatment should be carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere as opposed to air and the dosage should be carefully controlled in order to prevent undue damage to the tropocollagen triple helix molecule structure. The dosage depends upon the collagen concentration in the gel. Irradiation of 500 900 K rads at a dose rate of 80 85 K rads per hour is adequate to stabilize a 5 collagen gel while propc tionately higher doses or longer exposure is required for higher concentration gels, e.g. 1200 1600 K rads at a similar dosage rate and in the presence of nitrogen for a 10 gel. Chemical crosslinking is carried out by treatment of the collagen gel with such agents as formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, acrolein, glyoxal, dialdehyde starch, chromic acid, bifunctional reagents such as maleimide derivatives, alkyl and aryl halides, isocyanates, etc. We prefer the use of glutaraldehyde or acrolein due to their controllable reaction under proper conditions, and their ability to be more easily removed, e.g., by leaching from the crosslinked gel. Crosslinking is carried out on the lens shaped gel and preferably in the lens mold simultaneously with the molding of the lens. Typically, aqueous collagen gel containing 8.0 wt. 96 collagen and 0.8 mucopoly saccharide chondroitin sulfate, Cal Bio chem is mixed with 10 acrolein solution at a ratio of 0.067 1 acrolein to collagen. The mixture was de aerated by centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 1 20 minutes and placed in a lens mold. The crosslinking reaction was carried out at a pH of 6.2 0.1 M citrate for a period of preferably 6 7 hours at a low temperature 20 . Excess crosslinking agent was removed by washing with 0.1 M citrate solution at pH of 6.2 with a phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and finally with saline solution. Irradiation is carried out in a Gammator M type gamma irradiator obtained from Radiation Machinery Corporation, Parsippany, New Jersey.The glass vessel containing the lens mold during irradiation was a standard, relatively wide mouth, two hole rubber stopped vessel permitting removal of air and replacement with nitrogen. The lens molds used in the shaping of the collagen gel were manufactured from brass, glass and plastic. The mold consists of a lower concave part and an upper convex part. The surface of the convex part, when the mold is closed, reaches the surface of the concave section, except for the desired thickness of the collagen lens. The desired thickness is approximately 0.4 millimeters, preferably about 0.3 millimeters. NOVEL POLYHYPROXY COMPOUND CONTAINING LENS It has now been found that a superior stable, high clarity collagen gel soft contact lens in which the collagen gel contains a water soluble, aliphatic, monomeric, polyhydroxy compound, can be made by shaping and crosslinking with an aldehyde at relatively high pH, e.g., 5.0 to 8.0. The lens is particularly suitable for extended wear. This technique is applicable to both types of collagen gels, viz.solubilized or fiber or mixtures thereof. It has now been discovered that lenses of acceptable physical strength and biological stability i.e. resistance to bacterial attack may be prepared by an improved process by adding to the collagen gel at least one watersoluble, aliphatic, monomeric, polyhydroxy compound, and subsequently shaping and crosslinking the gel by aldehyde treatment. The monomer is preferably added to the collagen gel in an amount from 0.3 to 5.0 mol l in the collagen gel. Preferred additives are glucose, sucrose, fructose, lactose, galactose and glycerol, all of which are available commercially in relatively pure state. The preferred concentration of the additive varies with the particular additive, but generally falls within 0.5 to 3.0 mol l in the collagen gel, but in case of glycerol, within 1.0 to 5.0 mol l. The method is further improved by adding to the gel about 0.01 0.2M sodium citrate, sodium acetate or other salt of organic acid. Control of the collagen cross linking procedure is critical in order to assure a lens having the desired mechanical strength, clarity and biostability. It has been found that crosslinking by means of the irradiatIon method, e.g. Co60, ultraviolet light, etc., requires a fine degree of care and at times becomes too sensitive for assurance of desired reproducibility. Although the chemical method of crosslinking is susceptible te closer control of crosslinking conditions, it too has certain shortcomings e.g.extremely long reaction time, which led to the present discovery. If one attempts to crosslink collagen gel at its usual pH of 3.0 to 4.0 by treatment with an aldehyde, the reaction is extremely slow requiring a period of about 10 days to two weeks for satisfactory results. Now however, the reaction can be accelerated by raising the pH by addition of NaOH to 5.0 to 8.0 but under these conditions the gel becomes cloudy due to precipitation of collagen fiber and is not suitable for use in a high clarity contact lens. It has been discovered that the crosslinking reaction can be carried out by aldehyde treatment at the higher pH and at the same time avoid the cloudiness and produce a high clarity lens by adding to the acidified collagen gel about 1M of at least one of the aforementioned polyhydroxy compounds, e.g., glucose, adjusting to pH to 5.0 to 8.0, and then subjecting the gel to aldehyde crosslinking. Under these conditions, satisfactory crosslinking was accomplished at room temperature in about 16 hours. Such duration is commensurate with practical operation in which the gel undergoing crosslinking is placed in the lens mold, left overnight and recovered the following morning. The crosslinking is carried out by treatment of the collagen gel with such aldehydic agents as formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, acrolein, glyoxal, dialdehyde starch, etc. The use of acrolein and gluteraldehyde is preferred due to their controllable reaction under proper conditions, and their ability to be more easily removed, e.g. by leaching from the crosslinked gel.Crosslinking is carried out on the lens shaped gel and preferably in the lens mold simultaneously with the molding of the lens. Gels suitable for use in the preparation of collagen lenses of this aspect of the invention may be prepared from solubilized collagen, from fiber collagen and from mixtures thereof. The preferred gel is one made from enzyme solubilized collagen which has been treated for removal of fats and lipid bodies and which is poor in telopeptides and relatively free of other contaminating proteins, saccharides, etc. W .en mixtures of solubilized collagen and fiber collagen are used to prepare the gel, the ratio of solubilized collagen to fiber collagen is not critical and may range from 10 to 1 to 1 . 10 however, mixtures in the range of 50 50 are preferred. Gels having collagen concentrations from 1 to 30 wt. 96 can be utilized for collagen lens production, but the preferable concentration is 5 to 20 with the balance after addition of the other additives, being water. The method of obtaining the collagen from the crude collagen source, e.g skin, tendon, hide, etc., is not critical,. and some flexibility may be used in the selection of the particular tissue and the method applied thereto. The collagen may be solubilized by any of the standard extraction methods e.g.acid base or salt extraction or enzyme digestion or recovered in fiber form by dispersion in an aqueous medium and separation by some means such as centrifuging. Since we prefer to use gels prepared from enzyme digested collagen, the preparation of the collagen gel used as the starting material will be exemplified from the following description of that preferred process Cleaned, de haired hide or skin is cut into pieces of workable size and slurried in water in the presence of a proteolytic enzyme other than collagenase . Suitable enzymes are pepsin, trypsin, pronase, proctase, etc.The soluble extract is worked up as fo lows The solution is brought toa pH of about 10.0 when extrcting for example with pepsin or proctase to denature the remaining active enzyme, and then neutralized to a pH of about 6.7 7.0. 11Atelocollagen1 precipitates at this pH leaving behind in solution to be discarded the digested telopeptides, and other contaminating proteins, e.g. albumin, globulin, and any saccharides, mucopoly saccharides, etc The atelocollagen is usually further purified by repeated solubilization at pH 2 3, reprecipitation at pH 6 7 and recovered by filtration The recovered collagen is then washed with ethanol to remove any lipid content and excess water in preparation for the solvent defatting process.The collagen is defatted by treatment with 1 1 ethanol ethyl ether mixture and recovered as a fibrous solid. It is then air dried, and subsequently converted to gel by solubilization in acidified water at pH of about 3.0. The collagen gel may be worked up to a clear soft contact lens as follows To a 5 wt 96 aqueous collagen gel is added 0.2 mol l of citric acid and 1.0 mol l of glucose. The mixture is homogenized over a period of ap rox. 30 min. to obtain a clear gel. The pH is adjusted to 5.0 7.0 by the addition of aq NaOH soln. The gel is centrifuged to deaerate it and acrolein is added to extent of 2.0 wt. 96 dry basis in an ice bath. The gel was poured into a lens mold and kept overnight at room temperature. After approx. 16 hrs. the lens was removed from the mold. The lens was clear and of excellent physical and mechanical strength. It survived exposure to P.aeruginosa for a period of 8 days, before appearances of liquefaction set in. Although this aspect of the invention has been described as applicable to unmodified collagen, it may also be applied to chemically modified collagens in which the amino and or carboxyl groups thereof have been subjected to esterification or acylation respectively, or both. Suitable lens are thus prepared for example from methylated and or succinylated collagens. The amount of polyhydroxy monomer added to the. collagen gel varies approx. from Q.5 to about 5.0 mol l and generally amounts of 1.0 mol l are prefelrred. In case of glycerol, an amount of 3.0 molll is preferred. In conducting the crosslinking, aldehyde in the amount of 0.002 to 0.075 parts per part of collagen on a dry weight basis have been used Generally, amounts of 0.2 5.0 wt 96 of dry, collagen are preferred. Preferred crosslinking times are in the range of 8 to 20 hours at room temperature, and generally about 12 16 hours suffice. In its preferred form, this aspect of the invention provides a soft contact lens comprising a lens shaped, subsequently aldehyde crosslinked gel of solubilized collagen,. said gel comprising a 1.0 to 30 wt. 96 cllagen and b 0.3 to 5.0 mol l of a water soluble,, aliphatic, monomeric, polyhydroxy compound. Generally the gel consists of collagen, polyhydroxy compound and water. Preferred features are as follows 1. The solubilized collagen is enzyme digested collagen.2. The water soluble polyhydroxy compound is glucose. 3. The water soluble polyhydroxy compound 1S glycerol.4. The collagen gel is crosslinked by treatment with acrolein at a pH of about 5.0 to 8.0.5. The collagen gel is crosslinked by treatment with glutaraldehyde at a pH of about 5.0 to 8.0. In another preferred form this aspect of the invention provides an improved method for the manufacture of a collagen gel soft contact lens comprising the steps of a adding to a collagen gel containing 1.0 to 30.0 wt. collagen a watersoluble, aliphatic, monomeric, polyhydroxy compound, b adjusting the pH ofthe gel to about 5.0 to 8.0, c adding to the gel an aldehyde cross linking agent, d placing the gel containing the polyhydroxy compound and aldehyde in a lens mold, and e maintaining the gel mixture in the closed mold for a sufficient period of time to effect crosslinking of the collagen. Preferred features of the method are as follows 1. The collagen gel consists of solubilized collagen.2. The collagen gel consists of enzyme solubilized collagen.3. The polyhydroxy compound is glucose.4. The aldehyde is acrolein.5. The aldehyde is glutaraldehyde.6. Citric acid is also added to the collagen gel prior to crosslinking. Glass, stainless steel, brass and plastics teflon, polyethylene, polycarbonate may be used as a lens mold material. Glass and metals are generally preferable to plastics because of their stability against gammairradiation. The present invention may be further understood from the following examples Example 1 Tendon such as achilles tendon is obtained from the leg of beef animals. Tendon from other animals such as pigs is also useful. The sheath of achilles tendon is removed by cutting with scissors. The Y shaped tendon without the sheath is sliced 1 2 mm thickness by a meat slicer. The sllced tendon is treated with Stephan Micro Cut MVD machine A. Stephan U Sohne GmbH and Co. West Germany to homogenize and separate individual tendon fibers. The machine clearance settings through which the tendons are processed are sequentially coarse, medium and fine. Some water must be used with tendon for this treatment. Tendon fiber dispersion after micro cut treatment is washed in 5 NaCI solution for 2 3 hours and the collagen is collected by centrifugation.Washing with NaCl is repeated two or three times. Finally the collagen is washed with water to rernove NaCI. The washed collagen is treated with pancreatin to remove telopeptides, saccharides and proteins other than collagen, etc. at an enzyme concentration of 0.596 wt. of. dry collagen for l day at room temperature at pH 7 8. The enzyme treated collagen is collected by centrifugation and washed with 5 NaCI and finally with water. Then the collagen is treated with ethanol to remove water and lipid, then with 1 1 mixture of ethanol and ether to remove lipid or fat Ethanol ether extraction is carried out at room temperature with stirring for 1 day. The fiber collagen is collected by centrifugation, air dried, and powdered in a Wiley Mill into small particle size. The powdered collagen is swollen in citric acid or HCl solution pH 2 3. The collagen concentration is 1 3 in acidic aqueous solution. To disperse collagen fiber into finer fibrils, the powdered swollen collagen is ground in a mortar. The ground collagen becomes homogeneous and transparent and forms a clear, viscous dispersion in water. This transparent tendon fibril is stabilized by gamma ray irradiation or by chemical crosslinking, and converted, after pouring into a mold into il collagen gel lens as per Example 3 below. Example 2 Hide collagen was also treated in the same way as tendon collagen.Younger hide such as calf skin collagen is better for production of lens grade gel than adult animal collagen. In the case of the hide, the hair side and flesh side of hide are removed by cutting and only the corium layer of hide was used as a starting material. Lenses prepared from tendon and hide collagen fibers were clear, flexible, stable, optically suitable and generally resistant to bacteria. They displayed excellent properties as a soft contact lens. Example 3 Fresh calfskin about 5 kg. was dehaired, cleaned by shaving and cut into small pieces The skin was solubilized in 10 liters of water pH 2.5 HCl by addition of I g of pepsin approximate ratio of enzyme to collagen is 1 400 and kept at 200cm for five days with intermittent stirring. The resulting viscous solubilized collagen was filtered through cheesecloth, its pH adjusted to 10 NaOH and allowed to stand for 24 hours at 4 C to inactivate the pepsin. The pH of the collagen was then adjusted to 7 to 8 HCl and collagen precipitate was collected by centrifuging. Fatty constituents were then removed from the collagen.To one part of collected collagen was added two parts of fat solvent, e.g., ethanol ethyl ether mixture 1 1 and the mixture was homogenized in a Waring blender. Collagen was separated from solvent by squeezing in cheesecloth and homogenized again with the same volume of solvent. After being squeezed it was air dried to remove solvent and redissolved in acidified water pH about 3.0 to make a viscous pourable collagen gel. A 50 50 mixture of 0.2 g. 5 clear collagen gel of this Example 3 and of the viscous dispersion of Example l was placed on the lower concave part of a lens mold glass and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 3000 rpm at 10 C to make the collagen gel spread evenly across the mold surface. After 10 minutes evacuation in vacuum, the upper convex part of the lens mold was pushed onto the lower mold containing the collagen gel and the entire mold transferred to an irradiation vessel. The vessel was flushed and filled with nitrogen and gamma irradiated for 10 hours at a dose rate of 82 K rads per hour The molded collagen lens was neutralized with phosphate saline buffer, pH 7.2 and transferred to normal saline. The lens was placed on the convex part of a teflon mold, frozen and trephined while the lens was frozen.The finished lens was kept in normal saline solution. This lens was optically clear, flexible and stable, and displays excellent properties as a soft contact lens and showed no deterioration when exposed to bacteria that produce enzymes. Irradiation is carried out in a Gammator M type grnma irradiator obtained from Radiation Machinery Corporation, Parsippany, New Jersey.The glass vessel containing the lens mold during irradiation was a standard, relatively wide mouth, two hole rubber stopped vessel permitting removal of air and replacement with nitrogen. The lens molds which do not form part of this invention were manufactured from brass, glass and plastic. The mold. consists of a lower concave part and an upper convex part. The surface of the convex part, when the mold is closed, reaches the surface of the concave section, except for the desired thickness of the collagen lens The desired thickness is approximately 0.4 millimeters, preferably about 0.3 millimeters. Most lens material was finished with a trephine cylindrical instrument with one razorsharp circular cutting end , to a tapered edge lens. Instead of trephining, however, a lathe operation may also be used to finish to lens material. Example 4 A soft lens was prepared by procedures of Examples 1 and 3, except 12 clear collagen gels, a stainless steel mold and irradiation time of 20 hours were substituted. Again the resulting lens was optically clear, flexible and stable, and displayed excellent mechanical and physiological properties as a soft contact lens. Example 5 Solubilized, defatted collagen prepared as in Example 3 was succinylated by the following procedure Five grams of collagen were solubilized in 2 liters of acidified water pH 3.0 HCl and the pH thereafter adjusted to 9.0 with NaOH solution. Acetone 100 ml containing 2 g succinic arhydride was added gradually to the collagen suspension. During the addition of succinic anhydride the pH of the collagen suspension was maintained at about 9.0 by adding NaOH solution. Succinylated collagen was precipitated by acidification to about pH 4.2, washed repeatedly with water and freeze dried.Transparent succinylated collagen gel of pH 7 and an equal amount of tendon fibril collagen was placed on the lower mold part brass indicated and processed in the same way as Example 3. The resulting lens was completely transparent, pliable, and sufficiently strong to function as a soft contact lens. It is very comfortable to wear. Collagen gel lenses are kept in sterile water or saline solution and display excellent storage properties. They have approximately the same refractive index as water itself. Should a lens become dehydrated, partly or completely, due to exposure to heat or sunlight, it is restored unimpaired to its original condition by simple immersion in water, thus displaying its perfect memory charcteristic. A fens purposely allowed to become dry and shrivelled returned to normal in less than twenty minutes after water immersion. All of the lenses prepared above can bemodified by known optical techniques to prescription values. Thus, soft contact collagen lenses can be prepared for use by patients requiring known normal sight corrective measures, e.g., incorporation of spherical power. The advantages of soft lenses made from fibril collagen and fibril collagen solubilized collagen mixtures from a medical standpoint are summarized as follows 1. Collagen gel lenses are highly permeable to water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc. and tests show that their gas diffusion characteristics are practically the same as pure water. To date, collagen is the only natural materials used for contact lenses that can be so implanted without subsequent human rejection.2. The collagen water ratio of the cornea and the collagen contacl lens are strikingly similar. These two materials are closely related structurally, physiologically and immunologically. All other contact lens materials are totally unrelated to the collagen protein of tha cornea. The advantages from the consumer or wearer standpoint are summarized as follows l. The gas and water vapor permeability of the collagen membranes make it ideally suited for a constant wear contact lens without disrupting essential metabolic processes in the cornea.2. The similarity of this protein and the principal protein of the cornea make allergic and toxic reactions between the two very unlikely.3. The lower cost of preparation of the collagen lens material indicates a low cost to the consumer. 4. Collagen contact lenses are soft, pliable and transparent, and can be worn for extended periods of time without removal for cleaning, etc.Spherical power can be incorporated into them. Example 6 Enzyme solubilized collagen was prepared as follows Fresh calfskin about 5 kg was dehaired, cleaned by shaving and cut into small pieces. The skin was solubilized in 10 liters of water pH 2.5, viz1 by addition of I g of pepsin approximate ratio of enzyme to collagen is 1 400 and kept at 20 0C for five days with intermittent stirring. The resulting viscous solubilized collagen was filtered through cheesecloth, its pH adjusted to 10 with NaOH and allowed to stand for 24 hours at 4 0C to inactivate the pepsin.. The pH of collagen was then adjusted to 7 to 8 H Cl and collagen precipitate was collected by centrifuging. Fatty constituents were then removed from the collagen. To one part of collected collagen was added two parts of fat solvent, e.g. ethanol ether mixture 1 1 , and the mixture was homogenized in a Waring blender. Collagen was separated from solvent by squeezing in cheesecloth and homogenized again with the same volume of solvent. After being squeezed it was air dried to remove solvent and redissolved in 0.1 M citric acid solution containing IM glucose to make gel of 8 collagen. The pH of the gel was adjusted to 6.3 with NaOH solution.On the other hand, chondroitin sulfate C sodium salt from shark cartilege, Calibiochem Xvas dissolved in 0.1 M citric acid solution containing 1 M glucose pH 6.3, pH is adjusted with NaOH to make chondroitin sulfate concentrativn to 896 Chondroitin sulfate solution of 10 ml was mixed to 8 collagen gel of 100 ml and the mixture was homogenized well. To adjust.collagen concentration to 6 , 23.3 ml of pH 6.3 0.1 M citrate solution containing 1 M glucose was added to the mixture and homogenized well again. The mixture of collagen chondroitin sulfate collage.. concentration 6 chondroitin sulfate concentration 0.6 , pH 6.3, citrate concentration 0.1M, was cooled in an ice bath. To 10 g of ice cooled collagen chondroitin mixture was added 0.36 ml of ice cooled 0.5 glutaraldehyde in pH 6.3 of 0.1 M glucose solution and homogenized well in an ice bath. The mixture was centrifuged in a plastic syringe at 4 C at 4000 rpm for 1 hour to remove air bubbles. On a lower concave part of a lower lens mold glass was placed 0.2g of centrifuged collagen gel and the upper convex part of the. lens mold was pushed. onto the lower mold containing collagen gel. The entire mold was allowed to stand at 25 C for 16 hours to crosslink the gel. Collagen lens was removed. from the. mold and treated with 0.05 glutaraldehyde in pH 7.0 phosphate. buffer for 51 minutes to introduce enough crosslinkages intocollagerr lens. The lens was washed in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer repeatedly to leach out excess glutaraldehyde.. The finished lens was kept in a normal. saline. This lens is optically clear flexible and stable,. its water content was. 94 , and it displays. excellent properties as a biostable soft contact lens. Example 7 According ta the method of Example 6, 8 . collagen gel pH 6.4, in 0.1 M citrate and 1 M glucose was prepared. Polyvinylalcohol 99 100 hydrolized, J.T Baker was dissolved, in 0.1 M citric acid and. 1 M glucose solution pH 6.3 at a concentration of 8 . The mixture of collagen PVA was prepared and the lens was produced by using the exactly same procedure as that of Example 6 apart from glutaraldehyde crosslinking.. Acrolein was used for cross linking instead of glutaraldehyde. To 10 g of ice cooled PVA mixture was added 0.36 ml of ice cooled 5 acrolein in 0.1 M citrate l.0M glucose solution pH 6.3 . The mixture was centrifuged and the lens was shaped. For the second aldehyde treatment, the shaped lens was immersed in 0.1 acrolein in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer for 10 minutes to introduce enough crosslinkages. The lens is optically clear, flexible and stable and displays excellent properties as a bio stable soft contact lens. Water soluble polymers such as polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrolidone, etc., can be mixed by using the same method. The collagen lens mixed with these water soluble polymers is more blo stable than a lens of collagen alone. Also solubilized collagens other than enzyme solubilized collagen as described in Example 6, such as base extracted collagen, acid extracted collagen are able to be used for lens production using the methods ofExample 6 and 7. Fibril collagen ib also available for use in the collagenmucopolysaccharides and collagen water soluble polymers lenses. Example 8 Collagen 8 gel pH 6.4 in 0.1 M citrate and lM glucose was prepared according to the procedure of Example 6. Polyt2 hydroxyethy methacrylate poIy HEMA, Aldrich at 8 solution was prepared in pH 6.3 0.1 M citrate 1M glucose. With 100 g collagen gel was mixed0 ml of poly HEMA solution and the mixture was well homogenized. The mixture was placed in a vacuum dessicator and nitrogen was introduced into the dessicator to substitute nitrogen for the air dissolved in the mixture. The nitrogen saturated mixture was placed on the lower concave part of the lens mold and the upper convex part of the lens mold was pushed onto the lower mold containing the mixture. The entire mold was subjected to gamma ray irradiation for 5 hours at a dose of 0.1 M rads to effect partial crosslinking.The gamma irradiation introduced crosslinkages between collagen and colfagen and collagen and poly tiEMA. However, in order to introduce additional collagen to collagen crosslinkages the lens removed from the mold was treated in an acrolein solution of 0.1 in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer for 10 minutes. The crosslinked lens was washed in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer repeatedly to leach out excess aldehyde. The finished lens was kept in a normal saline. This lens is optically clear flexible and stable, and displays excellent properties as a biostable soft contact lens. The combination crosslinking by gamma irradiation and chemical treatment can be applied also to a mixture gel of collagen and water soluble polymers other than poly HEMA. Example 9 Enzyme solubilized collagen gel was prepared as follows Fresh calfskin about 5kg was dehaired, cleaned by shaving and cut into small pieces The skin was solubilized in twenty 20 liters of water pH 3.0, HCl by addition of 1 g of pepsin approximate ratio of enzyme to collagen is 1 400 and kept at 20 0C for five days with intermittent stirring. The resulting viscous solubilized collagen was filtered through cheesecloth, then the filtrate is diluted to 0 .5 1.0 collagen concentration and filtered through millipore filter of 0.65 c pore size, its pH adjusted to 10 with NaOH and allowed to stand for 24 hours at 40 C to inactivate the pepsin.The pH of collagen was then adJusted to 7 to 8 HC1 and collagen precipitate was collected by centrifuging. Fatty constituents were then removed from the collagen. To one part of collected collagen was added two parts of fat solvent, e.g. ethanol ether mixture 1 1 , and the mixture was homogenized in a Waring blender. Collagen was separated from solvent by squeezing in cheesecloth and homogenized again with the same volume of solvent. After being squeezed it was airdried to remove solvent and redissolved in 0.lM citric acid solutin containing IM glucose to make gel of 896 collagen. The pH of the gel was adjusted to 6.3 with NaOH solution. To about 10 g of the gel there is added 0.04 ml. of ice cooled 10 glutaraldehyde, the pH adjusted to 6.3 and the mixture homogenized well in an ice bath, followed by removal of air via centrifuge. On a lower concave part of a lens mold was placed about 0.2 g. of the centrifuged gel and the mold was closed. The entire mold was allowed to stand at room temperature 25 0C for 16 hours to crosslink the gel. The lens was removed from the mold and washed in pH 7.0 sodium phosphate buffer solution t o leach out any excess glutaraldehyde, then placed in saline solution for preservation. Example 10 Example 9 was repeated utilizing acrolein for crosslinking instead of glutaraldehyde. To 10 g of gel pH 7.0 there is added 0.24 ml of ice cooled 10 acrolein of pH 7.0 3 acrolein of dry collagen . The same excellent results were obtained. When adjusting the pH of the gel during aldehyde crosslinking care must be taken not to raise the pH much above 8.0, as this may cause collagen fiber formation and resulting cloudiness even when the polyhydroxy monomer additive is present. A pH of about 5.0 is required to initiate the desired reaction acceleration and a pH in the range of 5.0 to 8.0 is preferred. Lenses prepared according to this aspect of the invention were optically clear, flexible and stable and display excellent properties as a soft contact lens. They showed little deterioration when exposed for long periods of time to high concentrations of bacteria that produce enzymes. Collagen gel lenses are kept in sterile water or saline solution and display excellent storage properties. They have approximately the same refractive index as water itself. Should a lens become dehydrated, partly or completely, due to exposure to dry air, or freeze drying, it is restored unimpaired to its original conditions by simple immersion in water, thus displaying its perfect memory characteristic. A lens purposely allowed to become dry and shrivelled returned to normal in less than twenty minutes after water immersion. All of the collagen lenses of this aspect of the invention can be modified by known optical techniques to prescription values. Thus, soft contact collagen lenses can be prepared for use by patients requiring known normal sight corrective measures, e.g., incorporation of spherical power. In this specification, parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.
