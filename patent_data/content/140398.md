# Method of orally administering a composition to horses.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of administering to horses medicaments and or other substances which prom ote the welfare of these animals by presenting them incorporated in capsules so that they are taken freely. The method is suitable for example for the treatment of podotrochlosis by presenting the horses capsules with isoxsuprine or a salt thereof.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A method of orally administering to horses medicaments or other substances which promote the welfare of hor ses, characterized in that the agents are taken freely by the horses by presenting them while incorporated in capsules. 2. A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that isoxsuprine, or a salt thereof, as such or mixed with auxiliary substances, is made to be taken freely by the horses for the treatment of podotrochlosis by presen ting it while incorporated in capsules. 3. A method as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that isoxsuprine polystyrene sulphonate is made to be taken by the horses by presenting it while incorporated in capsules.

## Description
Method of orally administering a composition to horses.The invention relates to a method of orally administering a composition to horses.It is known that the oral administration of medicaments and other substances which promote the welfare of horses is particularly troublesome. Horses are very critical as regards that which they take in orally. The oral administration to horses of substances having a certain smell and or taste is substantially impossible. Such compositons are nearly alway refused by the animals.According to the invention described in German Offenlegungsschrift 2404007, this problem has been solved by bringing the compositions or substances to be administered in the form of a solid or doughy mass soluble in the saliva, or dispensing them in cartridges or capsules and connecting the substances in this form to or in the snaffle or bit before this is placed in the horse s mouth.This method suffers from the disadvantage of being rather cumbersome, requiring a special snaffle or bit having recesses, and being not suitable for all compositions and substances.It has surprisingly been found that horses accept and consume gelatin capsules without any problem. All this was found during an investigation into the influence of p hy droxy 1X C1 l methyl 2 phenoxyethyl ami r o ethylbenzyl alcohol known under the tradename isoxsuprine on navicu lar disease in horses podotrochlosis . Since isoxsuprine is a vasodilatory agent it might be active against the said disease the cause of which is presumably an insufficient blood circulation in the lower legs of the horse. A commercially available composition for this indication which contains isoxsuprine is a paste to be administered orally. It will be obvious that such an oral administration to horses is an action which is difficult to perform.During the investigation to come to a composition which is easier to administer it was found that the retard formulation of isoxsuprine known for human application, i.e. isoxsuprine polystyrene sulphonate in capsules, is taken without any problem by horses when such capsules are or are not mixed with some food.On the basis of the fact that it is generally known that it is very difficult to administer anything orally to horses, it may be said to be exceptionally surprising that the administration of capsules presents no problem whatsoever.In six institutions in England, the Netherlands and Germany experiments are now being performed with the capsules in question. Nowhere were any problems encountered in the administration, which was said to be very surprising by those skilled in the art.Other compounds which can be administered by means of capsules to horse are vitamin preparations such as vitamin A palmitate, riboflavine 5 phospate sodium, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, nicotinic acid and nicotinic acid amide.
