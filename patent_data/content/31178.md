# GREASE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING POLYUREA COMPOUNDS AS THICKENER AND NOVEL POLYUREA COMPOUNDS

## Abstract
A grease composition comprising a major amount of a lubricating oil base and a minor amount of a polyurea com pound obtained by reacting a compound A having the formula NH₂R₁, wherein R₁ is hydrocarbyl containing 3 to 30 carbon atoms, a compound B having the formula NH₂ C₃H₆NR₃C₃H₆NH₂, wherein R₃ is methyl, ethyl or n propyl, and a compound C having the formula OCN R₂ NCO, wherein R₂ is hydrocarbylene having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms. This composition has improved mechanical properties.
