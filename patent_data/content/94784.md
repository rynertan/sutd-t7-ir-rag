# APPARATUS FOR REELING

## Abstract
A continuously operable reeling machine comprises two reeling stations 1 and 2 . Whilst reeling proceeds at one station 1 , a full reel B may be removed from the other 2 and replaced by an empty reel to which the element being reeled is eventually transferred when the reel A at the first mentioned station 1 is full. Removal and replacement of that full reel is then undertaken whilst reeling proceeds at the other station. Each reel is supported in its reeling position by a pair of supports 4, 5 . One of those supports 4 may be pivoted from its operative, reeling, position to an inoperative position which permits withdrawal and replacement of the reel in the axial direction of the reel. During withdrawal and replacement reels A, B are supported on trolleys 50 which may be wheeled up to and away from the reeling stations. This arrangement is simple to operate and efficient in its use of floor space.
