## Description
This invention relates to a heat sensitive transferring recording medium capable of producing two sheets of records when used in a heat sensitive transferring recording medium such as thermal facsimile, thermal printer and the like, in such a manner that a sheet constituted of a substrate, a heat sensitive color forming layer on one side of the substrate and a heat sensitive transferring ink layer on the other side of the substrate is overlaid on a receiving sheet composed of plain paper to bring the heat sensitive transferring ink layer into contact with the plain paper. In such two sheet recording type, the substrate is thicker than that for one sheet recording type so that the degree of heat transmission is poor resulting in poor clearness of printed letters. In order to solve the problems, Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 24644 1979 proposes to incorporate a material of good heat conductivity in the substrate, and Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 75894 1981 proposes to incorporate a material of good conductivity in the heat sensitive transferring ink. However, there are not yet obtained record of satisfactory clearness of printed letters. An object of the present invention is to provide a heat sensitive transferring recording medium capable of producing clear printed images of high density and free from smudge. According to the present invention, there is provided a heat sensitive transferring recording medium which comprises a substrate, a heat sensitive colour forming layer on one side of the substrate, and a heat sensitive transferring ink layer, on the other side of the substrate, essentially consisting of a a wax having penetration JIS K 2235 of not higher than 5 at 25 degrees C and saponification value of 70 90, b a wax having penetration JIS K 2235 of not higher than 5 at 25 degrees C and acid value of 50 70, c a wax having penetration JIS K 2235 of 7 20 at 25 degrees C, d an extender pigment and e a colouring agent, and the contents of components a d in the solid matter of the heat sensitive transferring ink are preferably as follows In case that acid value and saponification value are outside of the range of the present invention,density of printed images is irregular and clearness of printed images is poor. In case where acid value and saponification value are within the range of the present invention, but the amount of the extender pigment is outside of the range, the density of printed images are not irregular, but clearness of printed images is poor and sharp printed images are not obtained and, in addition, smudge is formed. As the waxes used in the present invention there may be mentioned waxes which are usually used for heat sensitive transferring recording mediums, such as carnauba wax, montan wax, oxidized wax, paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax, low molecular weight polyethylene wax and the like, as far as they satisfy the conditions of the present invention. As the extender pigment, there may be used calcium carbonate, clay, barium sulfate, talc and the like, and calcium carbonate is preferable. As the coloring agent, there may be used coloring agents which are usually used for heat sensitive transferring recording mediums. If desired, a softening agent may be added. As the softening agent, various oils such as vegetable oil, animal oil, mineral oil and the like may be used. As the heat sensitive color forming layer, conventional one may be used. For example, there are used heat sensitive color forming compositions composed of a colorless dye such as lactone series dyes e.g. Crystal Violet Lactone , lactam series dyes, fluoran series dyes, spiropyrane series dyes and the like, a color forming agent such as phenyl compounds e.g. bisphenol A , organic acids or salts thereof and the like, and a binder such as PVA, CMC, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, casein, starch and the like. If desired, an auxiliary agent such as clay, talc and the like, is added. To the back surface of a heat sensitive color forming paper was applied an ink as shown in the table below the amount being parts by weight . The resulting heat sensitive transferring recording medium was used to form printed letters on a high grade paper as a receiving paper by using Handy Terminal HT 3000 tradename, manufactured by Canon K.K. . The results are shown in the following table. Simply mixing two or more waxes can not attain the advantages of the present invention, and further the amounts of the waxes and the extender pigment should satisfy the conditions of the present invention to achieve the effect of the present invention.
