## Description
Improvements relating to bucket type e le vnto r s nd conveybrs This invention relates to bucket type elevators and conveyors. The term bucket type is intended to embrace scoops, skips and other similar load carrying devices. Bucket type elevators and conveyors are known, but they normally involve use of chains and sprockets ta which the buckets are connected. Chains and sprockets are expensive to manufacture and maintain and require considerable and frequent lubrication. An object of the invention is to provide a buckettype elevator or conveyor which is cheaper to manufacture than existing types, easier to maintain, requires little or no lubrication and can operate at high speeds, e.g. of the order of 100 to 220 feet per minute i.e. approximately 30 to 60 metres per minute . According to the invention there is a bucket type continuous elevator, the elevator comprising a framework, at least two pairs of sprockets mounted in the framework, means for driving at least one sprocket, a pair of continuous cables passing over said sprockets and adapted to be driven by the sprockets, the buckets being attached to the cables by transverse tie rods which extend through apertures in adjacent buckets, and means for attaching the rods to the pair of continous cables, the buckets having overlapping adjacent ends. Preferably there are rollers mounted at the outer ends of the tie rods .and adapted to roll in guide means mounted within the framework. The means for attaching the rods to the cables may comprise ferrules fixed to the cables at intervals said ferrules being engaged in connection and each connector being joined to the associated tie rod. The ferrules are preferably joined. to the connectors by pins passing through apertures in the connectors and engaging slots or apertures in the ferrules. The ferrules may be attached to the cables by grub screws extending through radial holes in the ferrules and engaging metal pads which press against the cables and push the cables into shallow recesses in the inner wall of each ferrule. The connectors may be adapted to engage between the teeth of the sprockets so as to enable the sprockets to drive the cables. The means for attaching the rods to the cables may include trunnions, the trunnions including means by which they are clamped to the continuous cables. Each bucket may be supported by only two continuous ropes or cables, one rope or cable being located on each side of each bucket. Alternatively each bucket is supported by two pairs of continuous ropes or cables, one pair of ropes or cables being located on one side of each bucket and one pair on the other side. In the accompanying drawings Fig. 1 is a side elevation of a bucket type continuous elevator embodying the present invention rig. 2 is an end elevation of the same elevator Fig. 3 is an enlarged detail of a bucket Fig. 4 shows one side of a bucket and the trunnions by which it is supported from a pair of cables at that side Fig. 5 is an enlarged side elevation of a pair of buckets together with supporting cables passing over a sprocket Fig. 6 is a section through an intermediate unit showing a guide casing and rollers and trunnion assembly Fig. 7 shows a detail of a trunnion illustrating how ends of a cable are joined Fig. 8 is an internal view of an alte rnative embodiment of there elevator on which there is only one cable on each side.of the buckets and t,fi method .oftattachment of the cables to the tie rods is ehanged, Fig. 9 illustrates a portion of a ,9 ble with a ferrule attached to it Fig. 10 illustrates a similar cable and ferrule with a modified method of attachment Fig. 11 shows how two ends of cables, each carrying ferrules are joined Figs. 12 and 13 are respectively plan and side ele vat.ions of a connector for joining a cable to a tie rod Figs. 14 and 15 are respectively plan and side elevations of a connector for joining two cable ends together and for subsequent attachment to a tie rod Fig. 16 is a side elevation of an alternative shape of bucket Fig. 17 is a scrap elevation of part of a sprocket showing how the cable and connector mate with the sprocket in the alternative embodiment and Fig. 18 is an end elevation showing the shape of the outer portion of the sprocket of Fig. 17. In Figure 1 is shown an elevator having buckets supported by wire ropes. The elevator framework comprises a series of sections. At the top is a drive unit 1 which is also the emptying station. At the bottom is a fill unit 4 which also acts as a tension unit. Units 1 and 4 are joined by a pair oF intermediate units 2 and a middle unit 3. A bucket and rope assembly 5 is supported on specially designed sprockets 6. The sprockets 6 in the fill unit 4 and in the drive unit 1 are essential. The sprocket 6 in the lower intermediÅate unit 2 is provided to give additional support for the weight of heavy rope and bucket assembly but would not be required with a lightweight assembly. An additional sprocket not shown may be inserted if required in the upper intermediate unit 2. The bucket and rope assembly 6 comprises a series of overlapping buckets 8 preferably made of mild steel, stainless steel, plastic or nylon coated mild steel, or moulded plastic material such as polypropylene. The buckets are attached to parallel ropes 20 Figures 1 and 2 by trunnions described later . The ropes 20 may be, for example, plastic or nylon covered steel wire ropes but plastic or nylon covering is not essential. As shown in Figure 2, the parallel ropes 20 are driven by a pair of sprockets 6a and 6b both keyed to a drive shaft 21 driven via a chain and sprocket drive 22 by an electric motor 23. Although the elevator is shown as being driven from the upper sprockets, it could equally well be driven from the cornersprockets. At the fill unit 4 the ropes pass over two sprockets 6c and 6d. Sprocket Sd is keyed to shaft 22a and sprocket Sc runs freely on shaft 22a. Shaft 22a is supported by bearings 23a in bearing housings 24 which are horizontally slidable in guideways 25 to enable the tension on the ropes or cables to be adJusted by moving the shaft and sprockets horizontally, The additional sprockets 6e and 6f in the intermediate unit 2 ars supported on a shaft 26 carried by bearings 27. Sprocket 6e is keyed to shaft 26 and sprocket 6f is free running on the shaft. In the upper intermediate unit 2, the cable assembly passes through a guide casing 28 Fig. 1 , described later. The buckets 8 are fed, with material to be elevated, via a chute 29 by means of a controlled feed to a predeter mined level, for example 60 full, and transported upwardly in the direction of arrow 30. Because of the special shape of the buckets 8 they retain their contents even when in the horizontal position as shown in the middle unit 3. The buckets 8 discharge at the lower side of the drive unit 6 into a receiving chute 31. Again, because of the special design of buckets 8 they do not discharge their contents into each other. One form of each bucket 8 is shown in Figure 3. It will be seen that the bucket 8 has a lip 32 which prevents accidental discharge. of the contents when the bucket is horizontal. The bucket 8 has welded to a sleeve 33 and a bracket 34 with an elongated aperture 35 in it. The sleeve 33 and brackets 34 are the means by which ecah bucket 8 is attached to tie rods 37 Figures 4 and 5 in turn supported by the pairs of cables 20 through a double trunnion assembly 38a and 38b. It will be seen that each tie rod 37 passes through the sleeve 33 of one bucket 8 and the aperture 35 in bracket 34 of the adjacent bucket 8. The elongated aperture 35 allows for relative movement between adjacent buckets 8 as they pass round a bend. Each trunnion 38a, 38b is attached to respective cable 20 forming a pair of cables on one side of the bucket assembly.The trunnions and cables are, of course, duplicated on the other side of the bucket assembly. Between trunnions 38 and 38a is located a roller or wheel 39 As the cable assembly passes over each of the sprockets ó, the rollers or wheels 39 engage between the sprocket teeth 36 and support the trunnions as well as driving the ropes or cables see enlarged portion of sprocket in Figure 5 . The cables 20 are supported by cable guides 40 welded to the sprockets 6.The rollers or wheels 39 may be made of nylon or steel for example. The rollers or wheels 39 also support the cable and bucket assembly as it posses through the guide casing 28 in the upper intermediate unit 2 see Figures 1 and 6 . The construction of the trunnions 38a and 38b and rollers 39 shown in detail in Figures 6 and 7. The trunnion 38 is in two clamping parts 12 and 14. Part 12 is recessed as shown in Figure 7 either to receive two ends of a cable as shown or to receive a cable dotted line which passes through the trunnion chain dashed line .Trunnion clamping parts 12 and 14 are held together by socket screws 41, 42 to clamp the cable tightly to the trunnions. The tie rod 37 is passed through the trunnion assembly. The roller 39 is located on a bearing 3 on a sleeve portion of part 14 which may be, for example, of nylon or plastic based ferrobestos. When a joint occurs in the cable it is treated as shown in Figure 7 Portions 43 of the recessed trunnion clamp part .2 are milled out to form shallow cavities to receive collars 44 soldered to the cable ends which hold the cable ends firmly in position when the trunnions are bolted tightly together. Although a specific type of trunnion has been described any type of trunnion or clamping arrangement that achieves the same resuLts can be used. The elevator may operate at an angle of less than 900 to the horizontal, in which case a bucket of slightly different design may be employed and the lips on the bucket may be dispensed with. Although two supporting ropes are illustrated on each side of each bucket, there may be only one on each side or there may be more than two, for example three or more. The tie bar need not pass through the bucket it could, for example, alternatively be formed in two parts, one on each side of and integral with the bucket Instead of using a pair of cables on each side of each bucket as illustrated in Fig. 4, a single cable on each side may be used. As seen in Fig. 8 a bucket 50 is supported on a pair of cables 51, 52 one on each side.of the bucket.A guide tube 53 runs through the bucket and receives stub shafts 54 of connectors 55 attached to the cables 51, 52. Each connector 55 alao carries a stub shaft 56 on which is mounted a freely rotatable roller 57 e.g. of Nylon .The rollers run in tracks 58 mounted internally in the framework. The tracks are disccntinuous where the connectors 55 and cables 51 pass over the sprockets. The cables 51 in this embodiment are joined to the connectors by ferrules 59 Fig. 9 mounted at spaced intervals along the cables 51. The ferrules may be clamped or swaged to the cables 51 and are provided with grooves 60 to receive retaining pins. Alternatively or additionally the ferrules may be attached to the cables by grub screws 61 Fig. 10 bearing on steel pads 62 which press the cable into a recess 63 in the ferrule and clamp it firmly. The interposition of steel pad 62 prevents the sharp end of the grub screw from damaging the cable. here two ends of cables are to be joined each end has a ferrule 64, 65 Figs. 11, 14, 15 swaged to it and the two ferrules 64, 65 are inserted in a bore 66 in a connector 67a and held there by pins 67 and 68 passing through holes in the connector and engaging groove, in the ferrules. To attach the cable to a connector in the normal way the ferrule 59 is located in a bore 69 in the connector 55 Figs. 12 and 13 and a pin inserted through bore 70 in the connector to engage the groove 60 in the ferrule 59. In Fig. 16 is shown 2 preferred shape of bucket 70 which has a guide tube 71 for the tie rod and an elongated open slot 72 in a plate 73 also shaped to receive a tie rod. The slot 72 allows for relative movement between buckets and also enables a bucket to be withdrawn by undoing only one tie rod i.e. the tie rod which passes through guide tube 71. The lip 74 is arranged to overlap the adjacent end 75 of the next bucket so as to accommodate any potential spillage. As the cables 51 Fig. 17 pass over the modified sprockets 76 in this embodiment the connectors 55 engage arcuate recesses 77, any portion of the ferrules 59 or 64 which extends beyond the connector 55 is accommodated by the cut away portions 78 and the cable 51 runs in the groove 79 at the outer edge of the sprocket. In this embodiment the rdllers 57 CFig. 8 do not engage the sprockets and the track 58 may be discontinued in the area of the sprockets.
