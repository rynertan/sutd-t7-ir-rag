# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DRIVING A SOLID STATE CAMERA

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for raising up the sensitivity of a charge priming type solid state camera having means for sweeping out undesired excess charges generated by a verti cal smear from vertical signal lines. In the case that a scene illumination is higher than an appropriate value, the sweep out of the undesired excess charges is executed within each horizontal blanking period in order to reduce the vertical smear. In the case that the scene illumination is lower than the appropriate value, the sweep out thereof is stopped in order to raise up the sensitivity. Further, in the case that the scene illumination is lower than the appropriate value and the quan tity of the vertical smear is larger than a fixed value, the sweep out thereof is executed within each horizontal blanking period in order to suppress the vertical smear.
