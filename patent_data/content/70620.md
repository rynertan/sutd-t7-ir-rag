# HIGH DENSITY IMAGER

## Abstract
A photosensor array 28 includes two adjacent and par allel rows 30,32 of photosensors deposited on a common substrate, the photosensors being spaced apart uniformly, with the two rows being staggered longitudinally by half a spacing so that light which would fall on the boundary be tween two sensors in one row falls directly on a sensor in the other row.
