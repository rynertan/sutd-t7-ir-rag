# VERTICAL DRIP SEPARATOR APPARATUS AND METHOD

## Abstract
A system for preventing freezing of liquids during separation of liquids from natural gas at a natural gas well head comprising an elongated tank 10 mounted in a vertical attitude with a lowermost portion buried in the ground below the frost line an uppermost portion extending above the ground. A divider plate 44 separates the tank 10 into an upper compartment 40 and a lower compartment 42 . Each compartment 40,42 has a liquid reservoir 98,92 at the bottom thereof. An underground natural gas supply line is connected by inlet 12 to a mid portion of the lower compartment 42 whereby material gas including liquids such as water and hydrocarbon flows into the lower compartment 42 . The bottom reservoir portion 92 of the lower compartment 42 is connected to the bottom reservoir portion 98 of the upper compartment 40 by a vertical tube 46 therewithin whereby liquids which accumulate in the lower compartment reservoir 92 are lifted through the tube 46 to the upper compartment reservoir 98 by pressure of the natural gas whenever the lower inlet end 52 of the tube 46 is covered by liquids in the lower compartment reservoir 92 . A heater device operated by the natural gas supplies heat to a housing 26 surrounding the upper compartment reservoir 98 to prevent freezing of the liquids therein which are periodically automatically removed therefrom whenever a predetermined maximum volume of liquids are accumu lated therein.
