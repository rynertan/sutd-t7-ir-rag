# Cyanide reduction in nitroaromatic process.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of eliminating or sub stantially reducing the amount of cyanide formed in a poly nitroatomatic, e.g. dinitrotoluene process. The invention comprises removing the nitrophenolic material from the mononitroaromatic formed in a first stage nitration of toluene prior to feeding th emononitroatomatic to the subsequent nitration zones.
