# APPARATUS FOR RECORDING DATA.

## Abstract
An apparatus records data by scanning an exposure beam across a film by a scanning width control signal in accordance with an input signal. The apparatus is provided with abnormality detection circuits 35, 36 which compare a scanning width control signal S7 with an upper limit setting signal and a lower limit setting signal to detect whether the scanning width indicated by the scanning width control signal S7 is larger than the upper limit scanning width indicated by the upper limit setting signal or is smaller than the lower limit scanning width indicated by the lower limit setting signal. Thus the operator can always be informed infallibly whether the signal level of an input signal S4 indicating data to be recorded is outside an appropriate range.
