# Holographic head up display system.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an integrated optical design of head up displays suitable for use in aircraft cockpits and the like. The display system is comprised of a holographic optical element 11 used as the combiner for presenting a direct view of the exterior on which are superimposed image signals generated by a source device 51 such as a cathode ray tube 12 and transmitted to the combiner through an optical system 10 including a relay lens containing tilted and decentered optical elements to compensate for the aberration present in the holographic optical element 11 . There are further disclosed four relay lens design forms particularly suited for use in the design of such holographic head up displays. The disclosure includes integrated designs in which a the holographic ele ment 11 may or may not be constructed with aberrated wavefront and b a beam splitter is incorporated for insertion of a stand by sight, possibly also being tilted for the correction of aberrations.
