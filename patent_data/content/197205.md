# Programmable reference voltage generator for a read only memory, circuit comprising first and second voltage generators, and related control method.

## Abstract
A read only memory ROM includes a series of bit lines biased by a reference voltage lead 102 . The reference voltage lead 102 is connected to a first reference voltage generator 100 having an output impedance of 25 ohms and a second reference voltage generator 104 having an output impedance of 75,000 ohms. When the ROM is deselected, the first reference voltage generator 100 turns off and the bit lines are biased by the second reference voltage generator 100 . However, when the ROM is selected, the first reference voltage generator 100 is turned on and biases the bit lines. In this way, a ROM is provided which can operate in a low power mode without decreasing the access time when the ROM goes from a deselected state into a selected state.
