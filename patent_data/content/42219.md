## Abstract
A device for the controlled release of an active material into a liquid medium comprises a liquid soluble body having an array of cavities therein containing the active material. The body may be enclosed in a casing of a material having a relatively low dissolution rate and provided with means, e.g. an aperture whereby a portion of the body can be exposed to dissolving attack by the liquid medium. The body is so constructed that the cavity contents are released sequentially and at a predetermined rate.
