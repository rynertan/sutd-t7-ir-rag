# Rolling mill stand.

## Abstract
A rod or bar mill stand 72 is constructed to be used either in vertical or horizontal disposition. When in the horizontal disposition the rolls 3 are driven directly by the usual drive consisting of motor, pinion box and drive spindles which are arranged at the same general level as the stand. When the stand is in the vertical disposition, a drive adaptor 50 is introduced to transmit the drive from the drive spindles to universal spindles 71 arranged about the stand 72 to connect to the necks of the rolls 3 .
