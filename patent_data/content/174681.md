# ELECTRONIC CONTROL SYSTEM FOR PROCESS CONTROL IN A FERMEELECTRONIC CONTROL SYSTEM FOR PROCESS CONTROL IN A FERMENTATION ROOM NTATION ROOM

## Abstract
A control panel 30 comprises controls 1 14 and visualizers 21, 23 29 for programming and observation of the work cycle of the fermentation room and of the associated values of temperature, humidity and duration. A microprocessor control unit, having received the program med data and taking into account data taken by temperature and humidity probes 15, 16 positioned in the fermentation room under control, commands the performance of the selected cycle with the appropriate comand of intervention of the heating, cooling, humidification, ventilation and defrosting units 17 21 .
