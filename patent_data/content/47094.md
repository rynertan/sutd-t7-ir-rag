## Abstract
An optical measuring system for measuring in situ by means of one or more flbre optic probes reflection absorb tion fluorescence, phosphorescence and turbidity of a fluid or for all but the last measurement of a fluid solid interface. High intensity pulsed light is conveyed to the measurement site by a fibre optic cable and is given a specific direction at the site by means of the geometry of the probe, reaction light resulting from the stimulating light pulse is discriminated by the geometry of the probe, or another probe, and is returned via a further fibre optic cable to a measurement system which is enabled to sense the returning light only for the duration of the light pulse. The measurement system comprises means for sensing the relative intensity of the stimulating light pulse and for deriving a signal at least representative of the ratio of the magnitude of the quality sensed, by means of the probe, and the relative intensity of the stimulating light pulse. In one embodiment a unitary probe has three light channels, one conveying light to the site, one conveying light to the measurement system at least representative of the stimulating light intensity at the site and the last providing to the measurement system a signal representative of the magnitude of the quality of interest.
