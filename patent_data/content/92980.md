# AN IMPROVED FLEXIBLE ELONGATE BODY

## Abstract
A simple, inexpensive and compact overhead conductor incorporating an optical guide has a circumferentially rigid, circumferentially continuous aluminium central core 3 hav ing an elongate compartment 2 within and throughout the length of the core in which is loosely housed an optical fibre 1. A layer 4 of steel wires 5 surrounds the central core 3 and a circumferentially continuous outer layer 6 of aluminium surrounds the steel wires. Aluminium of the central core 3 and or of the outer layer 6 at least partially fills interstices between the steel wires 5. Use of expensive aluminium clad steel wires is unnecessary.
