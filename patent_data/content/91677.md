## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ALPHA HALO N,N DIMETHYLPROPIONAMIDES Background and Prior Art This invention relates to a process for the producticn of alpha halo N,N dimethylpropionamides by reaction of an ester as defined below with ,N dimet nylamine according to the reactionEMI1.1 in which X is chloro or broth and R is methyl or ethyl. In a preferred embodiment, the product of the process of this invention is an optical isomer of such an aside, and the ester which is also utilized is an optical isomer. The preferred ester reactant isL methyl 2 chloropropionate. Optionally, a bromopropionate or an ethyl ester of either iloro or brmmopropionic acid may be utilized. Sumnary of the Invention The reaction of esters with amines to produce amides is a well knawn reaction, commonly carried out involving many different esters and amines. In the present process, an improvement is obtained in that the dimethylamine is utilized in aqueous solution, in a concentration of between about 30 and about 408 by weight, to effectuate this reaction.The reaction is carried out preferably at roan temperature, that is from about 0 to about 30 C. but may optionally be carried out at higher terrr peratures, at approximately the boiling point of methanol or ethanol depending on whether the methyl or ethyl ester is utilized as discussed below. if the process is carried out at roan temperature, the need for a low teoperature dimethylamine condenser, required in the prior art, is eliminated. A further feature of the invention is that the process is carried out with the removal of methanol or ethanol, respectively, concurrently with the reaction. This has been found to be an important feature in the operation of the process, as there is otherwise a danger that the alcohol produced may react with the amide to produce undesirable byproducts. Such a possibility is most prevalent if the methyl ester is used, as methanol could react with the amide, by displacement of the chlorine or branine atom to produce a methylated by product.If the reactant utilized is the ethyl ester of chloropropionic acid, displacement of the chlorine atom and the resultant amide by an ethoxy group is less likely however, if the reactant is the ethyl ester of the bromopro pionic acid, such displace.ment is possible. The conduct of the process according to the present invention enables the production in good yield and purity including optical purity, if desired of the desired alpha halo N ,Nimtthylproi ionamide . The removal of the alcohol may be accomplished in either of two ways. In a preferred embodiment, the reaction is conducted in the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent, such as benzene, toluene, or xylene, mcst preferably toluene. This enables the partitioning off of the alcohol produced out of the organic chase, in which the amide produc ing reaction occurs, into the aqueous phase, thus re r xing it as a possible reactant with the amide which is in the organic phase and minImi zing the danger of Sy product production.Alternatively, the reaction could be carried out without the use of a hydrocarbon solvent, at the reflux temperature of the alcohol methanol or ethanol, respectively so that the alcohol is continuously removed from the reaction system as it is formed. When a hydrocarbon solvent is used, the organic and aqueous phases are separated after the reaction and the aqueous layer containing the alcohol is rested for further processing as desired. If the reaction is cn the other hand carried out at the reflux temperature of the alcohol, the alcohol is removed as overhead and further processed as desired. In order to prevent the production of undesirable by products by over reaction of the amine, the amount of amine used should be preferably kept below 1.5 moles per mole of the ester, with a preferred ratio of amine to ester of approximately 1.2 1. The following represents an exairple of the conduct of the process according to this invention. a In a flask were mixed 61.3 grams g. 0.50 mole L methyl 2chloropropionate, 100 milliliters ml. toluene, and 30 ml.water. There was then added dropwise a 40 by weight aqueous solution ofN,N dimethylamine, containing 67.5 g. 0.60 mole of the amine. The reaction temperature was controlled at between about 0 and about 5 C. The addition of the amine was carried out over a pericd of about 1.5 hours, with a further 30 ml. of water being added to the reac tin mixture during the addition, after about 1 hour. The reaction tem perature rose to about ll C. during the addition. The mixture was stirred for about 1.5 hours after the addition was complete, during which time the reaction temperature further rose to about 190C. The reaction product was analyzed by gas chromatography and was determined to contain 85.7 area percent of the desired product, alha chloro N,N Dimethylpropionamide. b Tb determine its cptical purity, the product was reacted with alpha n2phthol and the optical rotation of the resulting naphthoxyamide measured, as follows. In a flask were placed 28.8 g. 0.20 ole alpha naphthol and 9.0 g. solid sodiun hydroxide 97 pure . The mixture was stirred and heated. Then, 200 ml. toluene was added and the mixture allowed to cool to about 25 C. Next, 25.5 g. 0.14 mole of the alpha chloL o NfN dimethylpr pionamide prepared in step a above, was added dropwise, followed by heating the mixture to reflux temperature about 104 C , driving off water and toluene. The mixture was cooled to about 20 C., stirred overnight, then heated again to reflux about 97 C. . The resulting product was cooled to 75 ., filtered and washed several times with warm water until the wash water pH was about 7. The organic layer was separated, and the solvent evaporated, yielding 13.4 g. 30 of theoretical of a solid, which, after recrystallizaticn fran ethanol, melted at 142.5 C 143. 5 C It was identified as alpha naphthoxy N,N dimethylpropionamide by spectroscopic techniques. The product was determined to have an optical rotation of 162 , which ty comparison with knain standards, indicates it consists of 95 of the D isomer. The recrystallization was performed so as to return both the D and L forms of the alpha naphthDxypropion anide, therefore the optical rotation indicates the product of step a would also have been 95 D isomer of the chloropropionamide.
