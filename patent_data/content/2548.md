## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF WATER DISPERSIBLE RESINS,RESINS PRODUCED THEREBY, AND THEIR USE IN SURFACE COATINGS The invention relates to a process for the preparation of hydroxyl and carboxyl containing resins, which are dispersible in water with the aid of a base. Such resins can be used as binders in thermosetting lacquers and paints for the coating of objects. The advantage of water as a diluent for surface coating compositions is known it is non flammable, and it is inexpensive. The use of water does require, however, an adaptation of the customary binders. Widely used surface coating compositions are those containing a binder that is made soluble in water to this end, carboxyl groups are usually incorporated into a binder to an acid number higher than 30, which are then completely or partly neutralized with a base. Since many binders are polymeric substances, the high viscosity of these solutions sometimes presents difficulties, especially when a high concentration is required.Another difficulty is the long drying time that is often required before the surface coating can be enamelled if water is still present in the surface coating, when this is being enamelled, blistering may result. Aqueous dispersions in which the binder is dispersed in water instead of dissolved, have as advantages that higher binder concentrations can be used without viscosity problems, and that it is easier to evaporate the water from the surface coating than from a solution a drawback is usually that surface active substances or dispersants have to be used for making the dispersion, and for giving it a sufficient stability such surface active substances or dispersants generally have an unfavourable effect on the properties of the hardened surface coating in particular, they increase the water sensitivity. A process has now been found for preparing resins that are dispersible in water without using surface active substances or dispersants. The invention is defined as a process for the preparation of a hydroxyl and carboxyl containing resin, dispersible in water with the aid of a base, characterized in that 100 parts by weight of a copolymer component A , prepared from a 10 60 parts by weight of a vinyl ester of saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids in which the carboxyl group is attached to a tertiary or quaternary carbon atom, b 10 50 parts by weight of styrene or vinyl toluene, c 5 25 parts by weight of a hydroxyalkyl ester of an alpha beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, and d 0 40 parts by weight of an alkyl ester of an alpha beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid all these constituents per 100 parts by weight of copolymer, is reacted with from 5 to 25 parts by weight of a component B prepared by reaction of trimellitic anhydride and a glycidyl ester of saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids in which the carboxyl group is attached to 8 tertiary or quaternary carbon atom in molecular ratios of from 0.8 1 to 1 1.2. Preferred is a process wherein component A ib e copolymer prepared from a 30 40 parts by weight of vinyl ester of saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids in which the carboxyl group is attached to a tertiary or quaternary carbon atom, b 20 30 parts by weight of styrene or vinyl toluene, c 10 20 parts by weight of a hydroxyalkyl ester of an alpha beta ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, and d 10 20 parts by weight of an alkyl ester of an alpha beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, all these constituents per 100 parts by weight of copolymer. The saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids mentioned under A a and B preferably contain from 9 to 11, for instance 10, carbon atoms per molecule for the sake of brevity, they are also designated branched monocarboxylic acids . Aliphatic comprises in this context both acyclic aliphatic and cyclo aliphatic. Component A c is preferably a 2 hydroxy C2 or C3 alkyl ester of a C3 or C4 ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid preferred are hydroxyethyl methacrylate and 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate other examples are hydroxyethyl acrylate, and 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate. This component gives hydroxyl functionality for three purposes conversion with component B for incorporating carboxyl functionality, contribution to the hydrophilic balance, which is important for the dispersibility in water, and provision of active groups for cross linking during enamelling. The styrene or vinyl toluene contributes to the good chemical resistance it also has a function in the copolymerization with the vinyl esters, as is described in detail in British patent specificationNo 1,418,372. Component A d contains preferably a C1 to C10 alkyl group, and is preferably derived from aC3 or C4 monocarboxylic acid C4 to C10 alkyl groups are preferred to improve the flexibility of the cured coating examples are butyl acrylate and 2 ethyl hexyl acrylate. Copolymers as mentioned under A are preferably prepared according to the process given in British patent specification 1,418,372. According to this process such vinyl esters of branched monocarboxylic acids are copolymerized in mass with styrene and other monomers at temperatures above 1500C. Component B is a product prepared by reacting trimellitic anhydride and glycidyl esters of branched monocarboxylic acids in molecular ratios from 0.8 1 to 1 1.2 at temperatures up to 1500C.This reaction can be carried out in a solvent, for instance methyl ethyl ketone, in which case the reaction temperature is preferably kept belcw 1000C, or it is possible to work without a solvent and then temperatures from 80 to 150 0C are preferred. Trimellitic anhydride is a solid with a rather high melting point l680C under exothermic reaction it dissolves rapidly in the glycidyl esters mentioned. The reaction product has a low melting point and dissolves readily and completely in the polymeric component A . Component B is an acid polyester, probably formed by addition of epoxy groups to carboxyl groups, and half ester formation of the hydroxyl groups with anhydride groups. Although the exact mechanism of the reaction of component B with component A is not known, such a component B reacts as a cyclic carboxylic anhydride. Probably, the half ester groups in component B decompose above 1000C partly into anhydride groups and OH group a well known phenorrenon for half esters and the anhydride groups preferably react then with theOH groups of component A , which are present in excess. Per 100 pbw of component A it is preferred to take 10 20 pbw cf component B and these components are caused to react preferably at temperatures between 100 and 1500 C. Wit less than 5 pbw of component B per 100 pbw cf component A the dispersibility in water becomes poor with more than 25 pbw of component B per 100 pbw of component A a resin is obtained which after neutralization, becomes water soluble. A trict dividing line between solub0 itsy and dispersibility cannot be draws Dispersibility in water is attained by neutralizing the resin thus obtained with 70 1255 of the theoretically required quantity of a base, preferably ammonia or an amine. For a good dispersibility and stability of the dispersion the quantity of base is set to such a level that the pH of the dispersion is 7 8, preferably 7.5. Neutralizing is preferably effected at elevated temperature with vigorous stirring. In this way concentrated aqueous resin dispersions can be made, which may if desired be diluted further with water. Such resin dispersions can be processed further into paints and lacquers by adding pigments, extenders and other auxiliary materials for paints such as cross linking resins urea resins, melamine resins, phenolic resins , for instance in weight ratios from 90 10 to 70 30. Such resin dispersions have a good storage stability. It is also possible to add small amounts of organic solvents, for instance in order to modify spraying properties.The dispersions and the paints prepared from them can be applied to objects by the conventional techniques, such as by a brush or a roller, by spraying or immersion or by electrolytic deposition by means of a direct current on a metal object connected as an anode. After drying the paint layers can be enamelled at the usual temperature, such as 120 150 C the enamelled surface coatings have a good bond strength, gloss, hardness, flexibility and resistance to weather and chemicals. The present dispersions may, for instance, be used for applying one layer systems for all kinds of purposes, or for applying top coats to car bodies. The invention is illustrated by examples. Parts and percentages therein are parts by weight pbw and percentages by weight, respectively, unless stated otherwise. The vinyl and glycidyl esters of branched acids mentioned below are vinyl and glycidyl esters, respectively, of saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids in which the carboxyl group is attached to a tertiary or quaternary carbon atom and which carboxylic acids contain 10 carbon atoms per molecule.
