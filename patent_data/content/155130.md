# SEAT RECLINE UNIT

## Abstract
A recline unit 6 for controlling the recline angle of the back rest 2 of a seat 1 is interposed as a strut between the back rest 2 and the seat base 3 . The recline unit 6 has a recirculating ball screw 7 and nut 8 of which the former is mounted to the back rest 2 so as to be restrained against rotation and of which the latter is mounted to the seat base 3 so as to be restrained from moving axially but to be free to rotate. Manual pressure applied to the back rest 2 to incline it will move the ball screw 7 axially and cause the nut 8 to rotate. A locking mechanism 25 is provided to lock the nut 8 against rotation when the back rest 2 is in the desired reclined attitude and so prevent further axial movement of the ball screw 7 . The occupant of the seat 1 can unlock the locking mechanism 25 by operating a button 40 which acts through a pull cable 37 on the locking mechanism 25 . A back rest return device 41 includes a constant torque torsion spring 43 which, when manual pressure is removed from the back rest 2 and when the locking mechanism 25 is unlocked, will reversely rotate the nut 8 thereby to axially move the ball screw 7 reversely and so return the back rest 2 towards its upright attitude, the torsion spring 43 being strained when the nut 8 is rotated during reclining of the back rest 2 .
