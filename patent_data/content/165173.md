# Device for analyzing and correcting wavefront surfaces in real time using a polarization interferometer.

## Abstract
An optical system for analyzing and correcting wave fronts comprising a deformable mirror for correcting wave fronts and a system for analyzing and detecting phase distorsion, an interferometer with lateral duplication consti tuting the analyses system, receiving the wave front for analysis and duplicating it and deducing from two neigh bouring wave fronts obtained signals to control deformation of the said deformable mirror, wherein this lateral duplica tion interferometer is a polorization interferometer consist ing of a Wollaston double refractive biprism with an angle 0, the two prisms being assembled head to tail and cut parallel to the crystallographic axis such that the respective axes are parallel and perpendicular to the edges of the prisms a polarizer and an anlayser on either side of the said biprism and an oscillating optical member on the path of the said biprism.
