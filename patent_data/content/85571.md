# A computerised tomography apparatus.

## Abstract
Computerised tomography apparatus including an array of radiation detectors including plural scintillation crystals 21 and photoelectric transducers 23 alternately disposed to receive a fan shaped radiation beam. The scintillation crystal is optically connected with the photoelectric transducer at the interface therebetween, which is elongated in the direction X of the radiation impinging thereon and transverse to the direction of the array. The radiation passing through a patient s body to be examined impinges on the crystals causing them to scintillate. The light strikes the detection region of the photoelectric transducer causing the photoelectric effect to be manifested. The detection region does not depend on the size of radiation incident surface of the crystal. A certain portion of the light reaches the detection region via shorter path. The photoelectric transducer produces an electrical signal related to the intensity of the incident radiation as result of impinging light scintillated by the crystals.
