## Description
PREPARATION OF ESTERS This invention relates to a process for preparing esters of carboxylic acids, more specifically, esters which contain a cyano group bonded to the alpha carbon atom in the alcohol portion of the ester molecule. Esters with a cyano group so situated are prepared by reacting an acid with the appropriate cyanohydrin.According to U.S. 3,835,176, the reaction can also be effected by treating an acyl halide with a mixture of the appropriate aldehyde and aqueous sodium or potassium cyanide, optionally in an aprotic solvent. It is disclosed, for example, that 3 phenoxy a cyanobenzyl chrysanthemate is prepared in 64 yield by reacting chrysanthemoyl chloride, 3 phenoxybenzaldehyde, and an aqueous solution of sodium cyanide at OOC for 1 hour. Were it possible to shorten the reaction time and increase the yield, producing this and other alpha cyano esters by reacting an acyl halide with an aldehyde and a cyanide would be of great commercial interest. Insecticidal alpha cyano esters whose preparations would be facilitated include a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 3 2,2 dichloroethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarbozXylate and a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 3 2,2 dibromoethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate. Other insecticidal alpha cyano esters of particular interest area cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 3 2 chloro 3,3,3 trifluoropropenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 2,2,3 ,3 tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, a cyano3 phenoxybenzyl 2 4 chlorophenyl 3 methylbutanoate, cyano 3 phenoxyphenyl methyl 4 difluoromethoxy a 1methylethyl benzeneacetate, cyano 4 fluoro 3 phenoxyphenyl methyl 3 2,2 dichloroethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, cyano 6 phenoxypyrid 2 yl methyl 3 2, 2 dichloroethenyl 2 , 2 dimethylcyclopropanecarbox ylate, and cyano 3 phenoxyphenyl methyl 2 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenyl amino 3 methylbutanoate, as well as cyano 3 4 halophenoxy phenyl methyl 3 2,2 dichloro ethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylates, wherein halo is fluorine, chlorine or bromine. One advantage of this invention is that it provides a process for making alpha cyano esters in very high yield in a short time. Another advantage of this invention is that it provides an esterification process whose product does not require lengthy and expensive purification. Accordingly, this invention provides a process to prepare an alpha cyano ester by reacting an acyl halide with an aldehyde in a mixture of substantially waterimmiscible aprotic solvent and an aqueous solution of water soluble cyanide salt in the presence of a catalytic amount of rate promoting agent selected from tertiary amines, polyamines, cryptates, amphoteric surfactants, and acid salts of tertiary amines. Either the acyl halide or the aldehyde may exhibit optical or geometric isomerism, which is not affected by the reaction. In a preferred embodiment, there is provided a process for preparing an insecticidal a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl ester of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R is selected from 3 2,2 dichloroethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl, 3 2,2 dibromoethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl, 3 2 chloro 3,3,3 trifluoropropenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl, 2,2,3,3 tetramethylcyclopropyl, 1 4 chlorophenyl 2 methylpropyl, 1 4 difluoromethoxy phenyl 2 methylpropyl, and 1 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl amino 2 methylpropyl and R1 is selected from 3 phenoxyphenyl, 4 fluoro 3 phenoxy phenyl, 3 4 halo phenoxy phenyl, and 6 phenoxy 2 pyridyl which comprises reacting an acyl halide of the formula EMI3.1 wherein X is chlorine or bromine and R is as defined above with 3 phenoxybenzaldehyde, 4 fluoro 3 phenoxybenzaldehyde, a 3 4 halophenoxy benzaldehyde, or 6 phenoxy 2 pyridylcarboxaldehyde in a mixture of substantially water immiscible aprotic solvent and an aqueous solution of water soluble cyanide salt in the presence of a catalytic amount of rate promoting agent selected from tertiary polyamines, cryptates, amphoteric surfactants selected from aminoalkylsulfonic acids, and acid salts of tertiary amines. The process of this invention is especially effective in producing a high yield of insecticidal a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl esters in a short time when the ratepromoting agent is a tertiary polyamine or crypt ate andR is 3 2,2 dichloroethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl, 3 2 ,2 dibromoethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl, or 3 2 chloro 3,3,3 trifluoropropenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl, or when the rate promoting agent is an amphoteric surfactant selected from aminoalkylsulfonic acids and R is 3 2,2 dichloroethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclo propyl or 4 4 chlorophenyl 2 methylpropyi, or when the rate promoting agent is an acid salt of a tertiary amine and R is 3 2,2 dichloroethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl, 3 2,2 dibromoethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl, or 3 2 chloro 3,3,3 trifluoropropenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl. Outstanding results are obtained when R is 3 2,2 dichloroethenyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl. Although the process of this invention is especially advantageous when R is selected from the groups named above, the process is also effective in producing other alpha cyano esters wherein R is an aliphatic or aromatic group, which may optionally contain various substituents. Although the process of this invention is preferably employed to produce a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl esters by using 3 phenoxybenzaldehyde as a reactant, the process is equally suited to the production of other alpha cyano esters by varying the type of aldehyde employed in the process. Various aprotic solvents which are substantially water immiscible may be used in the process. Any alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, haloaryl, aralkyl, haloaralkyl, or cyclic hydrocarbon, provided that it is a liquid at temperatures between about O0C and 50iC and forms a discrete second phase when mixed with water, may be used. Such solvents include iso hexane, 3 methylpentane, 2,3 dimethylbutane, 2,2 dimethylbutane, n heptane, n octane, petroleum ether, ligroin, n propyl bromide, n propyl iodide, n butyl chloride, n butyl bromide, n pentyl chloride, n pentyl bromide, diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, dibutyl ether, benzene, toluene, and xylene, for example. Among these solvents, n heptane is preferred because it is readily available and inexpensive. A number of water soluble cyanide salts may be used for example, the salt may be an alkali metal cyanide such as lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, or cesium cyanide, or mixtures thereof. Among these, sodium cyanide generally is preferred. However, when it is desired to use certain cryptates as rate promoting agents, it may be desirable to substitute lithium or potassium cyanide as described below. The cyanide salt is dissolved in water, the amount of water employed being relatively small, but preferably sufficient to keep all of the cyanide salt in solution under the reaction conditions. In the case that the salt is sodium cyanide, the preferred molar ratio of water to sodium cyanide is between about 3.5 and 6, preferably about 4.5. The process of this invention is conducted in the presence of a catalytic amount of rate promoting agent selected from tertiary amines, polyamines, cryptates, amphoteric surfactants, and acid salts of tertiary amines. For purposes of this invention, a catalytic amount of rate promoting agent is in the range 1 5 mole percent based on aldehyde, advantageously about 2 mole percent. The rate promoting agent may be a tertiary amine or polyamine, a tertiary polyamine being a compound containing more than one tertiary amino nitrogen atom.Particularly desirable tertiary polyamines are linear tertiary polyamines of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein Y is CH2 k with k being 1 6, r C3 C7 cyclo alkane, C2 C6 alkenyl, or C2 C6 alkynyl z is 1 or 2, and when z is 1, m and n are 0 or independently 1 6, and when m and n are 0, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are hydrocarbon groups, and R1 may be joined with R2, and R3 may be joined with R4 to form a ring containing the N atom to which both are joined, and when m is 1 6 and n is 0,R1 and R3 are absent, and R2 and R4 are hydrocarbon groups, and when both m and n are at least 1, R2 andR4 are absent and when z is 2, m and n are 0, R1 and R3 are hydrocarbon groups and R2 and R4 are absent.

When the cyanide salt is sodium cyanide 4,7,13, 16,21 pentaoxa 1,10 diazabicyclo 8.8.5 tricosane is preferred, but when lithium cyanide is employed 4,7,13, 18 tetraoxa 1 ,10 diazabicyclo 8.5.5 eicosane should be used, and 4,7,13,16,21, 24 hexaoxy 1,1Q diazabicyclo 8.8.8 hexacosane is preferred when potassium cyanide is employed. Further, for purposes of this invention and wherever it appears in the specification or claims, the term aminoalkylsulfonic acids, means compounds having the structural formulaEMI6.2 wherein n is 2 or 3, and wherein R1 and R2 are substituents selected collectively to render the aminoalkyl sulfonic acids soluble in water immiscible aprotic sol vents.Suitable substituent groups, which collectively contain hydrocarbon units, are present in the following specific aminoalkylsulfonic acids 1 ,4 piperazinebis ethanesulfonic acid, 4 pyridineethanesulfonic acid, 2 N,N di 2 hydroxy ethyl aminoethanesulfonic acid, 3 cyclohexylamino propanesulfonic acid, 2 4 2 hydroxy ethyl piperzine 1 yl ethanesulfonic acid, 2 N morpho lino ethanesulfonic acid, N tris hydroxymethyl methyl 2 aminoethanesulfonic acid, 2 N morpholino propanes 2 N morpholino propanesul fonic acid, and N tris hydroxymethyl methyl 2 amino ethanesulfonic acid.Among these compounds, 1,4 piper izinebisethanesulfonic acid and 3 cyclohexylamino 3 cyclohexylamino pro panesulfonic acid are preferred, and 3 cyclohexylamino propanesulfonic acid is especially effective. The tertiary amines whose acid salts are rate promoting agents contain one or more, e.g., two, nitrogen atoms. For purposes of this invention and wherever it appears in the specification or claims the term, acid salts of tertiary amines, means products of the reac tion between a strong acid, such as HCl, HBr, H2SO41 HBF4, HClO4, or HCN and a tertiary amine or poly amine, a tertiary polyamine being a compound containing more than one tertiary amino nitrogen atom. For purposes of this invention, a tertiary amine has the structural formulaEMI7.1 wherein Ra, Rb, and R are hydrocarbon groups. c Particularly desirable tertiary polyamines within the scope of this invention are linear tertiary polyamines of the formula EMI8.1 wherein Y is CH2 k with k being 1 6, C3 C7 cycloalkane,C2 C6 alkenyl, or C2 C6 alkynyl z is 1 or 2, and when z is 1, m and n are 0 or independently 1 6, and when m and n are 0, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are hydrocarbon groups, and R1 may be joined with R2, and R3 may be joined with R4 to form a ring containing the N atom to which both are joined, and when m is 1 6 and n is 0, R1 andR3 are absent, and R2 and R4 are hydrocarbon groups, and when both m and n are at least 1, R2 and R4 are absent and when z is 2, m and n are 0, R1 and R3 are hydrocarbon groups and R2 and R are absent.

Acid salts of tertiary amines which may be employed in this invention include, for example, diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane dihydrochloride, 2,7 dimethyl2,7 diazaoctane dihydrochloride, 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10 octa hydropyrimido 1,2 a azepine hydrochloride, and quinuclidine hydrochloride. The process of this invention is carried out between approximately equimolar amounts of the acyl halide, preferably the acyl chloride, aldehyde and aqueous solution of cyanide salt in the water immiscible aprotic solvent, but slight excesses of the acyl halide and cyanide salt are typically used. The acyl halide may be added last, preferably dropwise, to the stirred reaction mixture, but it is preferred to add a solution containing aldehyde and acyl halide to a stirred mixture of aqueous cyanide salt and water immiscible aprotic solvent. Although the reaction can be carried out over a wide temperature range, the range 0µC 50eC is satisfactory in most cases, and it is preferred to carry out the reaction at room temperature, since neither external heating nor cooling are then required. The process will be understood more readily by reference to the following Examples, which illustrate it. Temperatures are in degrees Celsius. The reactions exemplified were, in many cases, monitored by gas liquid partition chromatography glpc , and the time required for disappearance of the limiting reagent after beginning addition of the acyl halide was determined, together with the amount of alpha cyano ester produced at that time.
