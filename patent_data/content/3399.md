# A method for increasing the selectivity to acetic acid in the production of a mixture of C1 to C3 monocarboxylic acids by oxidation of paraffinic hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
C₁ to C₃ mono carboxylic acids, including a substantial proportion of acetic acid, are produced by oxidising a paraffinic hydrocarbon feedstock with molecular oxygen at a temperature in the range 150 to 250 C and at an elevated pressure sufficient to maintain the reactants in the liquid phase in the presence as catalyst, of phosphoric acid and or a phosphate of one or more metals of Groups I and II of the Periodic Table, in particular sodium or potassium. In an alternative embodiment of the invention a co catalyst in the form of one or more metals of variable valency, particularly manganese, is incorporated in the reactants. The reaction products are recovered by distillation.
