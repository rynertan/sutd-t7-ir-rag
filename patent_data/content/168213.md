# CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR AIR PADS OR MATTRESSES

## Abstract
The operation of an air pad or mattress of the kind having one or more sets of air cells A,B that are selectively inflatable and deflatable to change from time to time areas of the pad or mattress providing support to a person s body is controlled by a system 10,11,12 including an air pump 14 , a series of valves 18 to 21 operable by a control unit 30 to inflate and deflate selectively the cells, and a pressure sensor 25 for sensing air pressures within the cells, information derived therefrom dependent on body weight and weight distribution being used by the control unit to determine operating air pressure values to which selected ones of the cels or sets of cells are to be inflated. Thus the system serves to adjust automatically air pressure within the cells according to current individual requirements. Sets of cells may be inflated alternately. Where the pad or mattress is provided with a single set of cells, the cells may be inflated sequentially, either in groups or individually.
