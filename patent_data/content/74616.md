# Control system for power shifted transmission.

## Abstract
A control system for a power shifted transmission includes an electrical signal processing system 28 , incor porating a digital processor, which provides output signals to regulate operation of the directional clutch 23 and the range clutches 24 through a plurality of spool valves. An hydraulic stabilizer 41 is connected to a common line supplying the directional clutch, to provide a predetermined amount of fluid with each change in direction, with the remainder of the fluid being provided through a forward reverse modulating valve 36 . A neutral bleed valve 42 is connected to reduce the measured amount of fluid in the stabilizer when the clutch is being shifted from the neutral position, instead of a full directional change. To improve range shifts, the directional clutch is slipped while the range change is made, and the directional clutch is then re applied. A horsepower indicator provides the vehicle operator with an instantaneous indication of the vehicle operating efficien cy. Inching or low speed operation, notwithstanding a high engine speed, is also provided.
