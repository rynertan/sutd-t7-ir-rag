# Potato processing apparatus.

## Abstract
A walking beam conveyor 28 feeds potatoes in a direction F to a cutting station where they are cut along planes 41 and 42 into four pieces. The conveyor 28 is pocketed and the pockets are configurated so that they cause each potato on the one hand to become oriented with its larger dimension generally at right angles to the feeding direction F, and on the other hand to move to a central position transversely of the conveyor 28. Thus, each potato is in a predetermined position when it arrives at the cutting station, so that the four pieces into which it is cut are roughly of equal size.
