## Description
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING AN IMAGE OF INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF A SUBJECT This invention relates to ultrasonic imaging techniques, and particularly to means for enhancing the quality of ultrasonically derived images by means of improved ultrasonic image display apparatus and method. This invention is applicable to the field of electronically scanned real time linear array ultrasonic imaging systems. Such a system includes 1 a transducer assembly having a linear array of elements for directing ultrasonic energy into a subject and producing electrical signals in response to ultrasonic echoes thus caused, 2 imaging electronics including circuitry for processing the electrical signals from the transducer and 3 a CRT display apparatus for generating an ultrasonically derived visual image of internal subject structure in response to the processed electrical signals. Combinations of the transducer elements are electrically actuated by the imaging electronics to direct ultrasonic energy into the subject. The imaging electronics sequentially actuates the various combinations of transducer elements in accordance with a predetermined pattern. The transducer element combinations are actuated such that the transducer assembly as a whole produces a particular sequence of resultant ultrasonic beams, these resultant beams emanating effectively from a succession of locations relative to the transducer assembly. The CRT display produces an image in a raster format. In producing the raster image, the imaging ele tronics causes the display apparatus to produce each respective raster image line in a predetermined relation with the production of one of the sequence of resultant ultrasonic beams. The relation is determined such that the spatial region of the subject represented by each raster line corresponds to the actual region of the subject from which the echo causing the production of that raster line emanates. While such systems have proven useful, it has for some time been recognized that specific improvements in image quality are desirable. One problem with the images produced by such systems is that often the raster lines of the displayed image are visually distinguishable one from another, impairing somewhat the resolution and subjective realism of the image. Another area in which improvement has been considered desirable is that of filling the blank spaces between raster lines with estimated or interpolated brightness, a feature not attainable satisfactorily in prior systems. This filling in achieves a gradual variation of the light intensity between adjacent raster lines, and the consequent reduction of the appearance of relatively dark lines in the spaces between adjacent raster lines. Clearly, a high quality interpolation between the lines is preferable. The achievement of first order interpolation, for example, causes the various image raster lines to appear to blend with one another in a pleasing fashion. Numerous proposals have been made for filling in between the lines, thereby making the image more pleasing and informative. It has been found difficult, however, to simultaneously 1 diffuse or blend the raster lines to eliminate distracting abrupt variances in light levels between the lines, and 2 maintain good resolution and 3 achieve high quality interpolation between the lines. The previous proposals include superimposing on the display deflection plates a sinusoidal periodic signal in addition to processed electrical and raster producing signals, for deflecting the electron beam of the display transverse to the raster lines, in order to blur them.It has also been proposed to selectively defocus the electron beam itself, to spread the beam. Both of these proposals have proved lacking. It has been found that, when a sinusoidal periodic signal is applied to deflect the electron beam transverse to the raster lines, a poor quality interpolation results.The interpolation between the lines becomes similar to that of a zero order, rather than a first order, or linear, interpolation. If a sine wave is superimposed on the plates the beam dwells longer near the extremities of its excursion about the raster line than near the center of the line The result is that the line brightness is concentrated away from the line center, rather than increasing gradually toward its center from a darker region between the lines. Such phenomena result in abrupt changes in the light levels between adjacent lines, rather than a desirable and pleasing variation. This increases the noticeability of the raster format, and makes more difficult the production of a realistic image. Another disadvantage in the use of periodic functions is that good quality periodic function generators must avoid interference phenomena such as oire patterns and may require additional circuitry to maintain proper adjustment, gain level and synchronization. This extra circuitry adds cost and can be associated with low reliability. Defocusing or astigmating the electron beam, while serving to blur the raster lines, has been considered disadvantageous because it is very difficult to defocus the beam and maintain Gaussian beam distribution. Also, unless special CRT design is used, when the electron beam is astigmated or defocused, the beam diameter increases, and it becomes more difficult to develop an image illustrating fine detail. The foregoing deficiencies of the described prior art systems are overcome by the apparatus and method of this invention. The ultrasonic apparatus embodying this invention produces an image of internal structure of a subject by the use of ultrasonic energy. The apparatus includes an ultrasonic transducer having means for directing ultrasonic energy into the subject and for producing representative electrical signals in response to echoes produced by the ultrasonic energy within the subject. The apparatus also includes circuitry for processing the electrical signals and a display apparatus responsive to the processed electrical signals for producing the image. The display apparatus includes a display medium, apparatus for producing an energy beam and means for deflecting the electron beam about the medium in a pattern of lines making up a raster. The apparatus further includes a random noise generator coupled to the display apparatus for additionally deflecting the energy beam in response to the random noise signal. The additional deflection is transverse to the lines of the raster pattern. The use of random noise to deflect the electron beam blurs the raster lines in a desirable manner, blending them together, without degrading the resolution of the image. In fact, this manner of diffusing the raster lines actually improves apparent image quality, resulting in a smoother, more pleasing picture than without the random noise superimposition. The improved picture results from a high quality interpolation caused by the use of random noise having a substantially Gaussian amplitude distribution, in accordance with a specific aspect of the invention. Additionally, the image is generally regarded as subjectively more pleasing than without the random noise usage, in that the raster lines tend to blend naturally with one another. With the use of random noise having a Gaussian distribution, the light levels between adjacent raster lines having differing brightness tend to vary in a linear fashion, rather than abruptly, such as occurred with systems employing sine wave modulation. Furthermore, interference phenomena which can occur with periodic functions areavoided when random noise is used. This results in less critical adjustment of gain and synchronization and thereby reduces system cost. According to a more specific feature of the invention, the random noise generator includes a noise doide and means for applying an electrical potential across the noise diode. Since the noise generator produces its noise relatively continuously without the aid of adjustment, there is no concern about maintaining the uniformity of the superimposed noise modulation signal. In accordance with another specific aspect of the invention, the amplitude of the random noise can be adjusted. Such adjustability enables varying the degree of diffusion of the raster lines to accommodate for changes in the distances between adjacent raster lines used to constitute an image. In accordance with another specific feature of this invention, the random noise signal is applied to the display apparatus by means of capacitive coupling to the deflection plates of the cathode ray display device. This invention will be understood in more detail with reference to the following claims and detailed description. In the drawings FIGURE 1 is partially graphic, partially block diagram illustrating an ultrasonic imaging system incorporating the present invention. FIGURE 2 is a block diagram illustrating a portion of the system of FIGURE 1. FIGURES 3 and 4 are schematic drawings illustrating in detailed form portions of the system shown in FIGURE 2. A system S incorporating the present invention is illustrated in FIGURE 1. The system S includes a transducer T connected to imaging electronics I by way of a set of leads W, and a display apparatus D connected to an output of the imaging electronics I. The transducer T is actuated by the electronics I to direct ultrasonic energy into a subject, such as a patient P. The ultrasonic energy causes the occurrence of echoes within the patient P at interfaces between his various body tissues. Some of the echoes return to the transducer T, which produces electrical signals over the leads W to the imaging electronics I. The electronicsI processes the electrical signals and directs them to the display apparatus D which, in response, produces a visual image, derived from the processed electrical signals, which represents internal structure of the body of the patient P.The electronics I can preferably also produce signals causing the display to produce a reference marker in the image. The display apparatus D produces the image of internal subject structure in accordance with a raster format. The raster consists of a series of lines L whose brightness varies with location to form a pattern representing the internal subject structure. The transducer T includes a linear array of individual transducer elements not shown . The imaging electronics, in actuating the transducer, stimulates a predetermined sequence of element combinations such that the transducer T produces a sequence of resultant ultrasonic beams effectively emanating from a succession of locations relative to the transducer T. The imaging electronics coordinates the production of the raster lines and ultrasonic beams so that the subject region represented by each raster line corresponds to the subject region penetrated by the beam from which the visual information of the raster line is derived. The display D is suitably embodied by a cathode ray tube oscilloscope. The oscilloscope includes a common cathode ray tube with a face constituting a display medium within an envelope, and an electron gun. The scope also includes horizontal and vertical plates for controllably deflecting electron beam from the gun about the tube face, and internal oscillator circuitry FIGURE 4 coupled to the plates for deflecting the beam to form a raster. Suitable parameters for the raster include numbers of lines ranging from 40 to 240, with line sweep times between about 87 microseconds and 260 microseconds. The raster lines may be either vertical or horizontal. The electron beam intensity is modulated by the processed electrical signals from the imaging electronics I to impart to the raster video information representing subject structure derived from the ultrasonic echoes. The transducer T, the leads W, the imaging electronics I and the display apparatus D are suitably embodied by an electronically scanned linear array real time ultrasonic imaging apparatus manufactured by applicant and designated as Model LS 1000. A noise generator N directs a random noise signal to the display apparatus D. The noise signal from the noise generator N is applied to the appropriate deflection plates of the display apparatus D to cause the electron beam of the cathode ray tube to rapidly oscillate or wobble transversely about each line, as the beam produces the line. If the lines L are vertical, the noise is applied to the horizontal plates if the lines are horizontal, the noise is applied to the vertical plates. The noise generation circuitry N is illustrated in block form in FIGURE 2. The noise generator N includes a noise diode 10, circuitry for amplifying and filtering the noise produced by the noise doide, and coupling circuitry for transmitting the noise to selected deflection plates of the cathode ray tube oscilloscope display apparatus D. The amplification circuitry for the noise signal includes a multilevel amplifier 12, differential amplifiers 14, 16 and a power amplifier 18. The filtering circuitry includes a band pass filter 20. The coupling circuitry is indicated at 17. Other circuitry comprising the noise generator N includes an attenuator circuit 22, enabling circuitry 24 and orientation circuitry 26. The attenuator 22 adjusts the gain of the multilevel amplifier 12 to enable selected variation of the amplitude of the noise produced by the noise generator N. The enabl r 6 circuitry 24 is used to turn on and off the differential amplifier 14 so that the application of the noise signal to the oscilloscope plates may be interrupted as desired, as when a reference index marker is generated in the image. The orientation circuitry 26 is connected to the coupling circuitry 17 for selectively applying the noise signal to the desired ones of the horizontal and vertical deflection plates of the oscilloscope display D.This feature enables the deflection of the electron beam of the CRT transverse to either vertical or horizontal raster lines. The features of the noise generator N are illustrated schematically in FIGURES 3 and 4. Referring first to FIGURE 3, the noise diode 10 is preferably indicated as an NOD 63 diode and is shown in connection with its associated supply circuitry 30. The signal from the noise diode 10 is a random noise signal having a substantiallyGaussian amplitude distribution, and a frequency distribution extending from about 1 MHz through 20 lEz and which appears on a lead 32. The multilevel amplifier 12 is indicated within the correspondingly numbered dotted box in FIGURE 3, and its principal elements include an operational amplifier 34 and transistors 36, 38, 40. The multilevel amplifier 12 amplifies the noise signal in an amount which is determined by which combination of a set 42 of attenuator input leads bears a signal. The attenuator circuitry 22, shown within the correspondingly numbered dotted box of FIGURE 3, includes amplification circuitry and attenuator outputs 43, 45, 47 illustrated in FIGURE 3 as coupled to vary the gain of the multilevel amplifier 12. The gain of the amplifier 12 can be varied in known fashion in steps from about Odb to 22db. Preferably, the raster image produced by the display apparatus D has between 40 and 240 lines. The fewer the lines in the raster used to produce the image, the farther apart are the individual adjacent lines. When the individual adjacent lines are relatively far apart, it is desirable to raise the gain on the multilevel amplifier 12 to produce a greater deflection of the electron beam and a greater spreading or blending of the raster lines. When a raster having a greater number of lines is used, the individual lines are closer together, and a lower amplification of the noise signal is desirable. This adjustment is obtained by varying combination of signals on the attenuator inputs 42 of the attenuator circuitry 22. The band pass filter 20 is illustrated within the correspondingly numbered dotted box in FIGURE 3 and has a pass band of about 10 to 20 MEz. The filter 20 passes noise signals from a lead 46 to an output point 48. The differential amplifier 14, having as its primary component an operational amplifier 50, is illustrated in FIGURE 3 as having complementary outputs appearing on leads 52, 54. Each of the complementary outputs is transmitted through respective power amplifier stages 58, 60, to appear respectively at sets of output terminals 62, 64. The enablement circuitry 24 is also shown inFIGURE 3. This circuitry includes an input 49, and inverter 51, transistors 53, 55 and an output lead 57. When it is desired to temporarily interrupt operation of the noise generator N, as during the production of an image reference marker, a signal is applied, e.g., from the circuitry I, at the input 49 producing an output on the lead 57, disabling the differential amplifier 14. When the signal at input 49 is removed, the amplifier 14 and the generator N resume normal operation. Interruption of generator N operation during marker production is desirable to assure the clearest possible definition of the marker. In FIGURE 3, each of the sets 62, 64 of output terminals include three terminals for each of the complementary noise signals. The subsequent discussion will deal with the outputs from only one of the terminals of each of the sets 62, 64, it being understood that the remaining terminals of the sets 62, 64 can be coupled to other display apparatus not shown for improving the picture not only on the display apparatus D, but also on additional display units. Referring now to FIGURE 4, the circuitry illus trated there shows the transmisson of the complementary noise signals appearing on terminals 58,0, illustrated in FIGURE 3. The noise signals on the leads 68,70 are transmitted over correspondng inputs to tho differential amplifier generally indicated as 16. The noise output from the differential amplifier 16 appears on the leads 74, 76, and is transmitted to a set of relays 78, 80, which together constitute a portion of the coupling circuitry 17. The positions of the relays 7S, 80 determines whether the noise signal is transmitted to the horizontal or vertical deflection plates of the cathode ray oscilloscope. If the relays 78, 80 are in their lower positions, the noise signals are transmitted to the vertical deflection plates not shown by way of a pair of leads 82, 84. lf the relays 78, 80 are in their upper positions, the noise signal is transmitted to the horizontal deflection plates 86, 88 of the oscilloscope over a pair of leads 90, 92. The noise signal on the leads 90, 92 is reactively coupled to the plates 86, 88 by way of a pair of capacitors 94, 96. The capacitors 94, 96 serve to transmit substantially only the .RC component of the noise and to eliminate any undesirable displacement of the individual raster lines of the display image which might occur if the noise component included a resultant DC value. A portion of the cathode ray oscilloscope of the display D, including an internal oscilloscope amplifier 100, for producing the raster is shown in FIGURE 4 as being connected in parallel with the noise signal to the deflection plates 86, 88. The orientation circuitry 26 is illustrated inFIGURE 4. The orientation circuitry includes an orientation input 102, an inverter 104 and a transistor 106, along with a solenoid 108 and associated circuitry. When a signal is applied to the terminal 102,. it is subsequently applied to actuate the solenoid 108, which actuates the relays 78, 80 to move to their upward position and to apply the noise signal to the horizontal deflection plates 86, 88. When the signal is removed from the terminal 102, the solenoid 108 actuates the relays 78, 80 to move to their lower positions which causes the noise signal to be directed onto the leads 82, 84 and, as explained above, subsequently to the vertical deflection plates of the cathode ray oscilloscope.
