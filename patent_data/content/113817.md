## Abstract
A current drive circuit is provided to drive each of forty electrodes 41 . When selected, the circuit forces line 27 to a level of drive voltage Vdr minus a current level re ference voltage. A constant current is produced across re sistor 25 . Line 27 is connected through resistor 29a to line 27a , which is the same point in the current drive circuit of the adjoining electrode 41a on one side of electrode 41 . Line 27 is similarly connected through resistor 29b to line 27b , which is the same point in the current drive circuit of the adjoining electrode 41b on the opposite side of elec trode 41 . Selection of the drive circuit also connects line 27 to the associated electrode 41 . An unselected drive circuit for an adjoining electrode, such as the one connected to drive electrode 41a , has line 27a floating to the level dictated by Vdr through its resistor 25a , while its electrode 41 is disconnected. Current from the unselected circuit through resistor 29a adds to the current in electrode 41 , thereby eliminating lightened edge printing from current spreading.
