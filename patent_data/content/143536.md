# Cartridge tape drive having vacuum auto threading.

## Abstract
A magnetic tape drive in which the supply reel 34 is con tained within a cartridge 16 , the tape 40 is automatically threaded from the supply reel 34 within the cartridge 16 past a magnetic head assembly 72 to the take up reel 62 by a vacuum source 24 coupled via apertures 108 in the hub 66 of the take up reel 62 to a generally enclosed continuous flowpath 70 extending between the supply and take up reels. The vacuum source 24 causes air to flow into the cartridge 16 through air inlet ports 86, 88 and around the opposite sides of the supply reel 34 to an opposite tape exit port 46 communicating with the flowpath 70 so as to pull the leading end of a length of magnetic tape 40 wound on the supply reel 34 through the flowpath 70 and onto the take up reel 62 . The supply reel 34 is initially rotated in a second direction to ensure that the length of magnetic tape 40 is completely wound thereon, following which the supply reel 34 is rotated in an opposite first direction to enable the leading end of the length of tape 40 to be picked off the supply reel 34 and fed into the flowpath 70 to the take up reel 62 . The take up reel 62 is rotated in a second direction opposite the first direction. The tape cartridge 16 has a door 50 in the housing 28 thereof which closes over the tape exit port 46 when the cartridge 16 is removed from the magnetic tape drive.
