# Transmission control device for vehicle.

## Abstract
In an automatic transmission control device, an electric selector includes a circular common switch, a P range switch, a R range switch, a N range switch and a D range switch. A range shifting is instructed by the electric selector. When the common switch and one of the range switches are both operated in a predetermined manner, an instruction signal is delivered from the electric selector to a microcomputer. The microcomputer discriminates whether the instruction is proper or not. When the instruction is not proper, the microcomputer does not generate range shifting signals to a transmission actuator and generates a long buzzer drive signal. A driver of a vehicle is notified about this fact by a long sound of a buzzer.
