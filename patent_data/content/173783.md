## Abstract
A pneumatic tire 10 having a tread portion 11 including a continuous mid circumferential rib 28 , and primary grooves 22 and 23 on each side of the rib that form an S or Z shaped configuration diagonally across the tread portion. A plurality of blades 30 are arranged to extend in circumferentially spaced blade paths 34 across the tread. The blade paths 34 extend substantially con tinuously between the tread edges 12 and 13 in a diagonally opposite direction to the primary grooves 22 and 23 so that each primary groove is intersected by a plurality of blade paths.
