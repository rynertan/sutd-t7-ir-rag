# Mortar ammunition.

## Abstract
Mortar ammunition with a projectile body 4 and a tail tube 5 containing the necessary propellant charge. The tail tube 5 and the projectile body 4 constitute two separate components which, for the purpose of being loaded into the mortar, are capable of being lowered in turn into the mortar via its barrel 1 until they come into contact with each other inside the barrel 1 . When the mortar is fired the projectile body 4 will leave the mortar without taking wilh it the tail tube 5 . The projectile body 4 and the tail tube 5 make contact with each other via a girdle 5 fixed to the tail tube 5 , said girdle being caused by the gases from the propellant charge to become detached from the tail tube 5 and to become securely attached to the projectile body 4 , so that the girdle is carried out of the barrel 1 by the projectile body.
