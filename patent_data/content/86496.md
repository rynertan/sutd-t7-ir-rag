# Magnetic recording reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a magnetic recording reproducing appara tus, in which a luminance signal and a carrier chrominance sig nal are separated from a composite color video signal, a lumi nance carrier signalis frequency modulated with the luminance signal, a frequency of a subcarrier signal of the carrier chromi nance signal is frequency converted into a low band frequen cy so as to dispose the carrier chrominance signal in the fre quency band lower than the lower side band of the luminance signal, a sound carrier signal is frequency modulated with an aural signal, the aural signal is disposed in the frequency band between the luminance signal and the carrier chrominance sig nal, and the video signal and the aural signal are frequency multiplexed and recorded. A comb line filter 33 is inserted in a recording luminance signal processing circuit for separating the luminance signal from the composite color video signal and for processing the luminance signal.
