## Description
The present invention relates to a boron hydride type compound obtainable by reacting in an inert gas atmosphere in the presence of an inert solvent the salt of mineral acids, carboxylic acids or organic sulfonic acids and an optically active amino alcohol represented by the formula II , wherein R₃ represents a C₁ C₈ alkyl, C₆ C₁₀ aryl or C₇ C₁₁ aralkyl group, R₄ represents a phenyl group which may be substituted with a C₁ C₆ alkyl or a C₁ C₆ alkoxyl group, and a mark means an asymmetric carbon, with a metal boron hydride, whereby the molar ratio of the metal boron hydride to the optically active amino alcohol is 0.7 1 to 2 1. It further relates to a method for producing optically active α,β unsaturated alcohols by the asymmetric reduction of ketone compounds using the above compound. More particularly, it relates to a method for producing optically active alcohol derivatives represented by the formula III , wherein R₁ represents a C₃ C₈ cycloalkyl group which may be substituted with a halogen atom or a phenyl group which may be substituted with a halogen atom, a C₁ C₄ alkyl group or a C₁ C₄ haloalkyl group, R₂ represents an imidazol 1 yl or 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl group and a mark means an asymmetric carbon, characterized in that the asymmetric reduction of a ketone compound represented by the formula I , wherein R₁ and R₂ have the same meanings as above, is carried out in an inert gas atmosphere in the presence of an inactive solvent at a temperature of 30 to 100 C, optionally in the presence of an acid, with the boron hydride reducing agent according to Claims 1 4, or with a boron hydride reducing agent obtainable by reacting the optically active amino alcohol as defined in claim 1 with a borane in an inert gas atmosphere in the presence of an inert solvent whereby the molar ratio of the borane to the optically active amino alcohol is 0.7 1 to 1.3 1, The optically active alcohol derivative represented by the above formula III , i.e. an azole type α,β unsaturated alcohol derivative is known to be useful as an active ingredient for fungicides, plant growth regulators or herbicides, as represented for example by 1 2,4 dichlorophenyl 2 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 4,4 dimethyl 1 penten 3 ol, 1 4 chlorophenyl 2 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 4,4 dimethyl 1 penten 3 ol and 1 cyclohexyl 2 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 4,4 dimethyl 1 penten 3 ol. And, it is also well known that there is a remarkable different in the activity between the optical isomers, and that, for example with the foregoing 1 2,4 dichlorophenyl 2 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 4,4 dimethyl 1 penten 3 ol and 1 4 chlorophenyl 2 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 4,4 dimethyl 1 penten 3 ol, the isomer has a strong activity as fungicides, while the isomer has a strong activity as plant growth regulators and herbicides Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid open Nos. 99575 1982 and 106669 1982 . For this reason, there is a great demand for the development of a method to produce either one of the or optical isomer according to intended uses and yet with a good efficiency in industry. As the conventionally well known common reducing agent for reducing the carbonyl group of ketone compounds into alcohol compounds, there are various reagents represented by lithium aluminum hydride and sodium borohydride. The reduction product produced when these reagents are used is an optically inactive, i.e. racemic compound, and when these reagents are used for the reduction of ketone compounds having an unsaturated bond, particularly α,β conjugated unsaturated ketones like the material used in the method of the present invention, reduction of the double bond in addition to the carbonyl group is easy to occur, and besides there also comes out a possibility that the steric configuration correlated with the double bond is isomerized. As the conventionally known asymmetric reduction method for the ketone compound represented by the above formula I , there is a method in which for example a ketone compound represented by the formula IV , wherein X represents a hydrogen or chlorine atom, is reduced with an asymmetrically modified lithium alminum hydride compound to obtain an optically active alcohol compound represented by the formula V , wherein X and a mark have the same meanings as above, Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid open Nos.99575 1982 and 106669 1982 . Said method, however, may not always be said to be satisfactory in industry in the following points 1 Since lithium aluminum hydride is used, there is a danger such as ignition by contact with moisture, and 2 in order to obtain an alcohol compound having a higher optical purity, additives such as N substituted aniline are required in large amounts. US A 4 203 995 describes a procedure for producing alcohols by reducing ketone compounds with a complex metal hydride. Also, in asymmetric reduction, the following methods are reported as a method for producing optically active alcohols using an asymmetrically modified boron hydride reducing agent But, the methods 1 , 2 and 3 are too low in optical yield to say that they are a practical method. Also, the method 4 may not always be said to be satisfactory to carry it out in industry because, in order to attain high optical purity, borane of two times by mole, as converted to boron basis, as much as amino alcohol is required. EP A 142 566 discloses a method for producing an optically active alcohol derivative using a boron hydride compound modified with an asymmetric ligand of the following formula In view of the situation like this, the present inventors extensively studied a method for obtaining the optically active alcohol derivative represented by the formula III by the asymmetric reduction of the ketone compound represented by the above formula I , and as a result, found that, by using a boron hydride reducing agent modified with the optically active amino alcohol of the above formula II , only the carbonyl group is selectively reduced into the objective optically active alcohol derivative with safety as well as good efficiency. Next, the method of the present invention will be illustrated. The optically active amino alcohol of the above formula II used in the method of the present invention can be produced, for example, by reacting the derivative of amino acids e.g. commercially available optically active alanine, C phenylglycine, phenylalanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine with a Grignard reagent represented by the formula VI , In the formula II , R₃ is a substituent resulting from the derivative of the foregoing amino acids, and its specific example includes a methyl, isopropyl, iso butyl, sec butyl, tert butyl, phenyl and benzyl groups. Specific examples of R₄ include a phenyl, o toluyl, m toluyl, p toluyl, 2,5 xylyl, o methoxyphenyl, m methoxyphenyl, p methoxyphenyl, o ethoxyphenyl and benzyl groups. In the present invention, the halogen atom represents fluorine atom, chlorine atom or bromine atom. Next, reference will be made to a method for producing the boron hydride reducing agent modified with the optically active amino alcohol hereinafter referred to as present reducing agent which is obtained by reacting the optically active amino alcohol represented by the formula II or its salt with an acid with a boron hydride compound. The present reducing agent, when the boron hydride compound is a metal borohydride, is obtained by reacting a salt, as obtained from the optically active amino alcohol represented by the formula II and an acid, with the metal borohydride in a solvent, or when the boron hydride compound is a borane, it is obtained by directly reacting the optically active amino alcohol represented by the formula II with the borane in a solvent. As the foregoing acid which is a material for producing the salt of the optically active amino alcohol, there are given mineral acids e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid , carboxylic acids e.g. acetic acid , organic sulfonic acids e.g. p toluenesulfonic acid . Said salt may be used as such or may be produced, in situ, from the optically active amino alcohol and the acid in the reaction system for producing the present reducing agent. As the metal borohydride described above, there are given for example sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride, lithium borohydride or zinc borohydride. But, the object of the present invention can sufficiently be achieved by using easily available sodium borohydride. As the borane, diborane, borane tetrahydrofuran complex, borane dimethyl sulfide complex, etc. may be used. In production of the present reducing agent, the molar ratio of the boron hydride compound to the optically active amino alcohol is, when said compound is a metal borohydride, generally 0.7 1 to 2 1, preferably 0.7 1 to 1.3 1, more preferably 1 to 1, as converted to boron basis, and when said compound is a borane, said molar ratio is generally 0.7 1 to 1.3 1, preferably 1 to 1. The solvent used in producing the present reducing agent is not particularly limited, so long as it does not take part in the reaction. For example, however, there are given aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene , halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. methylene chloride, 1,2 dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride , and mixtures thereof. When the metal borohydride is used, in order to solve it, for example dimethyl sulfoxide, diglyme, dimethylformamide or 1,3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone may be used in combination. The reaction temperature is generally within a range of 78 to 100 C, preferably 40 to 100 C. The reaction is generally carried out in an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon. The present reducing agent thus obtained may be used for the subsequent reduction after separated from the reaction solution, but generally, it is used as the solution without being separated therefrom. Next, reference will be made to a method for producing the optically active alcohol derivative of the above formula III by reduction of the ketone compound represented by the above formula I using the present reducing agent thus obtained. The amount of the present reducing agent used in the reduction is not less than 0.5 mole, generally within a range of 1 to 5 moles, as converted to boron basis, based on 1 mole of the ketone compound, and even the range of 1 to 2 moles can sufficiently achieve the object. Also, the solvent used in the foregoing reduction is not particularly limited, so long as it is an inactive solvent. Preferably, however, organic solvents such as aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene , halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. methylene chloride, 1,2 dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride , ethers e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diglyme and mixtures thereof are used. Also, the solvent used in producing the present reducing agent may be used as it is or in mixture with the solvents described above. The reduction is carried out in an inert gas atmosphere as described above. The temperature of the reduction is generally within a range of 30 to 100 C, and industrially within a range of 10 to 50 C. The foregoing reduction may be carried out in the presence of an acid, and particularly when sodium borohydride is used as a material for the present reducing agent, isomerization between the E form and Z form of the ketone compound represented by the above formula I is inhibited, whereby the yield of the objective optically active alcohol derivative can be increased. As the acid, there are given for example Lewis acids e.g. titanium tetrachloride, boron trifluoride etherate, aluminum chloride , carboxylic acids e.g. acetic acid, chloroacetic acid, propionic acid , and mineral acids e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid . The molar ratio of these acids to the ketone compound is generally within a range of 0.01 1 to 1 1, preferably 0.01 1 to 0.5 1. After the reduction is carried out in this way, the aqueous solution of a mineral acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid is generally added to the reaction solution, the organic layer is separated from the aqueous layer, washed with water and dried, and then the organic solvent is removed by evaporation. By this procedure, the objective aforementioned optically active alcohol derivative represented by the formula III is obtained in a high yield. The optical purity is obtained by measuring the optical rotaiton of the product obtained, or directly measuring the enantiomer ratio by high performance liquid chromatography with optically active packing materials. Hereupon, the optically active amino alcohol used can easily be recovered, with its steric configuration maintained, by adding an aqueous alkali solution to the aqueous layer after the reaction and extracting with an organic solvent. The recovered optically active amino alcohol can be re used.
