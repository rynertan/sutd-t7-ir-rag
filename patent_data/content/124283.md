# Process for the preparation of benzoyl ureas.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of benzoyl ureas is provided wherein the condensed intermediate formed by the reaction of a halogen substituted nitrobenzene with a hydroxy substi tuted cyclic or bicyclic compound is contacted with water, forming a solid or semi solid which is easily isolated. Reduction of the nitro compound to the corresponding amine and subse quent carbamoylation of the amine with an isocyanate are all conducted in the same solvent.
