# A spring actuated piston pump and a turbo charged engine utilising such a pump.

## Abstract
A spring actuated piston pump for use in lubricating the bearings of a turbo charger rotor, both on starting and stopping an associated internal combustion engine. The pump has a piston and cylinder combination 10,11 the piston 10 of which is spring urged 28 towards the cylinder head 13 , and there is a releasable catch arrangement 24,33 operable on the piston 10 to restrain movement of the piston towards the cylinder head when the piston is part way between the extremes of its travel. The catch means 24,33 is solenoid operated 30 for connection to the engine starter system, so that the piston 10 is released when the engine is started. The pump chamber 17 is connected to the engine lubrication system and the turbo charger bearings through suitable ducts and one way valves, so that on ordinary operation of the engine the pump chamber is full of oil with the piston fully retracted. On stopping the engine the piston moves under the spring bias discharging oil to the turbo charger bearings until restrained by the catch arrangement. Subsequently on re starting the engine the piston is released so as to continue its movement under the spring bias again discharging oil to said bearings.
