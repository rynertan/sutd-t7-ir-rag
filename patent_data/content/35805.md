# CONTROL UNIT FOR CUTTER BARS IN GENERAL

## Abstract
The invention concerned relates to a control unit for cut ter bars in general which comprises, in cascade and or con nected together inside an oil bath casing, from the opposite ends of which there emerge a rotatable shaft for coupling to a normal power take off and a reciprocating lever for coupling to the saw of a cutter bar, a step up unit for the rotary inlet motion, a sliding surface device for converting the rotary motion into multi directional reciprocating motion, and a spider for converting this latter motion into unidirectional reciprocating motion for the reciprocating lever, this latter being rigid with said spider, there being finally provided upstream of the step up unit means for adjusting the contact between said sliding surfaces.
