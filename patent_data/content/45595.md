# Electrostatographic process and apparatus.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for imposing an electrical charge on an electrically insulating surface wherein a brush electrode 1 contacts the surface. The brush is made up of extremely soft and flexible carbon fiber filaments 3 mounted on a metallic brace 5, 7 which also serves as an electrical contact to supply the brush with d.c. potential whereby an electrically insulating surface is charged to nearly the potential applied to the brush.
