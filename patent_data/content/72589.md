# Current stabilizing arrangement.

## Abstract
In a known current source arrangement which generates a current whose temperature coefficient is only equal to zero at one specific temperature, steps are taken, in accordance with the invention, to render the generated current indepen dent of the temperature over a wide temperature range by compensation of the disturbing factor in the relationship between the generated current and the temperature.
