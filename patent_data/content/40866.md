# Impact irrigators.

## Abstract
An improved impact irrigator comprising rapid return means constituted by a deflector 21 disposed at the end of a rocker lever 11 and arranged to be immersed into the jet when in its operating position the rocking move ments of the lever 11 are induced by a linkage control led by an appendix which, at the end of the outward and return rotations of the irrigator, interferes with two fixed stops when the rocker lever 11 is in its rest position with the deflector 21 outside the jet, the configuration of the linkage is such as to keep the lever 11 locked in said position, so making it insensitive to external stresses the connection between the linkage and lever 11 is made with a certain slack which enables the lever 11 , when outside its rest position, to rock further through a short distance without this changing the configuration of the linkage.
