# Multi bladed cutting apparatus.

## Abstract
Gang saws and other cutting apparatus having oscillating cutters for cutting workpieces into slices. The apparatus has two elongate spaced apart cutter supports 12, 13 which are driven to oscillate 180 out of phase with each other. Two sets of cutters 11 are connected to the supports. For a suitable workpiece the cutters may be of a hot wire type. Each cutter 32 of one set 11 is connected to the first support 13, 47 by a resiliently extensible connector such as a spring 34 and to the second support 12, 47 by a non extensible connection. Each cutter 32 of the other set 11 is connected to the second support 12, 47 by a resiliently extensible connector 35 and to the first support 13, 47 by a non extensible connection. Desirably the cutters of one set alternate with cutters of the other and all cutters are coplanar. Movement of cutters of each set in opposite directions tends to cancel the local influence of cutters on the workpiece. Moreover whole frame of cutters may be removed and replaced, facilitating reprogramming of the apparatus in terms of spacings between cutters.
