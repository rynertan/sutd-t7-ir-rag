# Method for producing bone cement for fixing protheses and device for carrying out said method.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for producing bone cement for fixing protheses, whereby the bone cement is manufactured by mixing various substances with each other to provide a setting mass which in set condition is adapted to fix protheses at surrounding bone tissue. In order to prevent large amounts of air from being stirred into the mixture, mixing of said various substances occurs under vacuum. The invention also relates to a device for carrying out the method for producing bone cement for fixing protheses, whereby the bone cement is manufactured by mixing various substances with each other to provide a setting mass which in set condition is adapted to fix protheses at surrounding bone tissue, and whereby the a mixture is applied to the bone tissue by means of a feed device 20 from which the mixture 19 may be pressed out. In order to avoid transfer of the mixture from a special mixing container to the feed device, the present device comprises an agitator 8 which is connectable to the feed device 20 and a vacuum source 17 which is connectable to the feed device for mixing said substances in said feed device under vacuum.
