# Pilot valves.

## Abstract
A pilot valve for a servovalve includes a pair of nozzles 42, 43 supplied with supply fluid under pressure, and a flapper armature 13, 25 movable relative to the nozzles to vary the differential pressure at outlets 44, 45 of the valve. A magnetic assembly 10, 30 operates in response to an input current to effect movement of the flapper and includes spring means 24, 27, 28 for applying a centering force to the flapper armature to overcome a decentering force of the assembly on the flapper armature when the input current is zero, the spring means being such that the centering force is just sufficient to overcome the decentering force of the assembly so that the flapper will move to maintain output pressure proportionl to input current irrespective of changes in pressure of the supply fluid.
