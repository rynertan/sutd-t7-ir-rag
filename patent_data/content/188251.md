# Signal transmission method in a bus type network.

## Abstract
A signal transmission system which constantly allows data with the top priority to pass preceding others in a bus type network. In transmitting a packet consisting of a plurality of start synchronized frames, the bus is monitored for a predetermined period after the first frame transmission. If a frame start signal is detected during this predetermined period, the next frame is promptly transmitted synchronous ly with the detected frame start signal. If no frame start signal is detected during this period, the next frame is transmitted immediately after the predetermined period elapses. As a result, each frame by a transmitting terminal starts at the same time as that by another terminal. Therefore, so long as the clock pulse error between the different terminals is small enough to permit a frame transmission, the terminals can detect collision for each frame. As soon as either of the terminals detects collision, it stops data transmission, whereby a packet with the top priority is always permitted to pass.
