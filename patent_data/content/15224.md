# Building and shaping a tire.

## Abstract
A flat cylindrical carcass band is built on a cylindrical surface provided by a unique shaping means and abutting turnup means. The shaping means has inner and outer walls the ends of which are juxtaposed solid elastomeric end rings 82 so as to form an annular envelope 27 . The outer wall has between its inner and outer layers an arrangement of spring blades 100 of particular shape formed to control the toroidal shape of the expanded outer wall to a precisely determined contour. The turnup means each include an inner and an outer bladder 22,73 the edges of each being also juxtaposed solid elastomeric end rings. The end rings of each turnup means are seated with the associated end rings of the shaping means in a common retaining groove formed in a circumferential set of radially extendable segments which expand the end rings and the overlying carcass to conform the carcass initially about prelocated bead cores. To conform the carcass about the bead cores before fully shaping the carcass toroidally, the shaping means has also a pair of inner bladders 20 each having a solid elastomeric ring interfitting respectively with and between the end rings of the mentioned envelope. These latter inner bladders cooperate on inflation to roll the carcass band lying close to the respective beads outwardly and to compact the bead region, and thereafter the shaping means envelope is inflated to shape the carcass between the bead regions and the outer bladder of the turnup means is inflated to extend the turnup, and optionally, to apply sidewall mater ial. The foregoing abstract is not to be taken as limiting the invention of this application, and in order to understand the full nature and extent of the technical disclosure of this appli cation, reference must be made to the accompanying drawing and the following detailed description.
