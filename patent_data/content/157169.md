# FRICTION ELEMENT ANTI RATTLE SPRING

## Abstract
The anti rattle spring 44 provides for resilient loading between a pin mounted friction element carrier 39 and a pin 40 of a disc brake assembly 10 . The disc brake assembly 10 includes a friction element carrier 39 having two ear tabs 33, 35 with apertures 36, 37 therein. The apertures 36, 37 receive axial pins 40 inserted therethrough for mounting the friction element carrier 39 to the disc brake assembly 10 . One aperture 36 communicates with a positioning recess 43 disposed in the ear tab 33 , the positioning recess 43 providing an area for positioning the anti rattle spring 44 rela tive to the aperture 36 and friction element carrier 39 . The anti rattle spring 44 comprises a body portion 46 defining a loop with legs 50, 54 extending outwardly therefrom, one leg 50 being bent over in a U shaped portion received in the po sitioning recess 43 and having a projection part 61 extend ing from one end of an aperture 57 to engage the surface of the friction element carrier 39 , and the other leg 54 having a trough shaped portion 55 extending toward the center of the aperture 36 . The trough shaped portion 55 engages the pin 40 inserted into the one aperture 36 and is bent downwardly to be positioned over the positioning recess 43 . The resilient loading between the friction element carrier 39 and pin 40 eliminates any noise generating movement during the braking cycle and travel over uneven terrain.
