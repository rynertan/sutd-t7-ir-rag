# Silicon nitride sintered bodies and a method for producing the same.

## Abstract
Silicon nitride sintered bodies are disclosed having high density, mechanical strength and fracture toughness, which contain the oxides or oxynitrides of Sr, Mg and a rare earth element each 0.1 to 15 by weight as element and of Zr 0.1 to 11 by weight as element the remainder being Si₃N₄ at least 70 by weight . They are produced by shaping a raw batch material containing compounds of each of Sr, Mg, a rare earth element and Zr as a sintering aid and the remainder silicon nitride powder, and conducting pressure less sintering of the shaped body in nitrogen or an inert gas atmosphere. Preferably the Zr is introduced by abrasion of grinding balls made of zirconia.
