# Method of investigating electrical components as to structural flaws.

## Abstract
Insulation flaws in electrical components are detected by measurement of electrical leakage before and after immersion in a mobile ionising solvent, e.g. a lower alkyl alcohol. A signifi cant increase in leakage is indicative of a flaw, e.g. a crack in the insulation.
