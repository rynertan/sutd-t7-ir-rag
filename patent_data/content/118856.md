## Abstract
A hopper assembly for use in a product transporting apparatus comprising a rotary drum SD having at least one circumferential row of equally spaced, radially inwardly recessed pockets 28 for receiving therein products to be transported while they are sucked therein by the effect of negative pressure developed in the respective pockets as the rotary drum rotates in one direction. The hopper assembly comprises a container having a bottom plate 42 inclined at a particular angle Ï‘1 downwardly towards the periphery of the drum and terminating at a particular position, and a nozzle assembly 47 for supplying jets of compressed air into the container for permitting the products to be upwardly moved thereby to facilitate the supply of the products successively onto the respective pockets.
