# Capacitive indicator of position.

## Abstract
A capacitive indicator of position, comprises an oscilla tor 41 operating within the frequency and with the wave shape selected for the operation of the device, transmitter strips 11, 12 of a length of the desired distance of indication of the movement and formed, e.g., in the way of printed circuits as connected to the said oscillator 41 as well as corresponding receiver strips 21, 22, 31, 32 as connected to a differential amplifier, 42 e.g. to the amplifier of an integrated circuit. Hereinafter it is possible, by means of the indicator, 43 to indicate a connecting together of the transmitter strips and the receiver strips by means of mobile plates 14, 15 placed on the device whose position is supposed to be indicated. According to the invention, the transmitter strips 11 and the receiver strips 21 are formed in such a way in pairs tnat the mobile plates 14 when placed on one side of the indication point, 16 connect a certain one of the transmitter strips 11 with a certain one of the receiver strips 21 but, after the mobile plates 14 have moved to the other side of the indication point 16 , this connection has become apposite.
