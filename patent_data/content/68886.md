# Drive transmission for roller conveyors.

## Abstract
A roller conveyor drive chain is equipped with drive transmission elements 30 for frictionally contacting the rollers 12 of the conveyor 10 . Each element 30 is se cured to a respective link of the chain 15 and extends at each end beyond this link to overlap the adjacent chain link. The parts of the elements 30 which project beyond their own chain link are an assymetrical wedge shape, having one side extending at an acute angle to the length of the chain 15 so that two adjacent elements 30 overlap one another laterally and have a line of separation which is acutely inclined across the chain 15 to reduce transmission noise as the elements 30 pass in contact with the rollers 12 .
