# Removal of scale from porous diffusion tiles.

## Abstract
A method for cleaning diffusion tiles used in the oxygen distribution system of the biological treatment ponds of wastewater treatment facilities is disclosed. The build up of ferric hydroxide scale, which blocks the pores in such diffusion tiles 55 , is removed by 1 purging the oxygen distribution system with a nonoxidizing gas such as nitrogen 10 , 2 injecting substantially pure HCl gas 11 through the system which removes the scale, and 3 purging the system again with the nonoxidizing gas before resuming oxygen feed. The use of a nonoxidizing purge gas before and after acid treatment prevents severe corrosion in the oxygen distribution system caused by the simultaneous presence of HCl gas and oxygen.
