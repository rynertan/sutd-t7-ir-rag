# Control system for deinterleaving memories in digital audio reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A control system for deinterleave memories in digital audio reproducing apparatus in which a plurality of cross interleaved symbols are written into or read out from memory areas of a RAM. The control system includes a first process for preparing the RAM consisting of at least a memory area with a predeter mined storage capacity, a second process for making a first processing as to a first symbol in the plurality of cross inter leaved symbols to the memory area, and a third process for making a second processing as to a second symbol in the plurality of cross interleaved symbols to the memory area.
