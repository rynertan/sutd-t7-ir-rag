# A retaining device ncluding a double bevel spring retaining ring.

## Abstract
A double bevel spring retaining ring of the type adapted for assembly within a groove provided therefor in a housing bore or on a shaft to form an artificial shoulder for axially locating a machine part in the bore or on the shaft. The spring comprises an open ended ring body of spring material. The body includes opposite side surfaces, each surface including a generally radial shoulder forming portion and a groove seating portion 30B which is inclined at an acute angle relative to the shoulder forming portion. Either of the groove seating surface portions 30B are adapted to engage a correspondingly inclined wall of the groove to take up axial play of the machine part. The length of each groove seating surface portion 34 M is from 80 to 120 of the minimum groove penetration depth 32 M for the ring.
