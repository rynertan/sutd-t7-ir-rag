## Description
FUROINDOLE DERIVATIVES This invention relates to novel furoindole derivatives which have analgesic, anti inflammatory and antipyretic activity. Although being not specifically disclosed in the past, 2 morpholinocarbonyl 6 trifluoromethyl 4H furol3,2 b indole is within a generic teachings of the Japanese Patent ApplicationLaid open No. 51 63194. Compounds having alkylcarbonyl or alkoxycarbonyl substituents at the 4 position of the furo 3,2 biindole nucleus are not known. The compounds of the present invention are compounds represented by the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is isobutyl, 3 heptyl or isopropoxy. The object of the present invention is to provide novel furoindole derivatives possessing excellent analgesic activity. The compounds of the present invention are prepared, for example, by the following methods. Ethyl 6 trifluoromethyl 4H furoj3,2 blindole 2 carboxylate is converted to 6 trifluoromethyl 4H furo 3,2b indole 2 carbonyl chloride in accordance with the method described in the Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 523096. Th is compound is condensed with morpholine in a solvent such as benzene, acetone, chloroform, dichloromethane or the like to give 2 morpholinocarbonyl 6 trifluoromethyl 4H furo 3,2 b indole. This reaction may be carried out with stirring at room temperature for several hours. 2 morpholinocarbonyl 6 trifluoromethyl 4H furo 3,2 blindole thus obtained is reacted with a compound of the formula R CO X wherein X is halogen and R is defined above, in the presence of an alkali such as sodium hydride, sodium methoxide or the like in an organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, ethyl ether, acetone or the like with stirring for 20 minutes to several hours to give the compound of formula I. The compounds of the present invention have excellent analgesic, anti inflammatory and antipyretic activity when compared with the known furoindole compounds, therefore they can be used as medicaments to mammals. For these purposess, they may be administered orally in a conventional dosage form such as tablet, capsule or powder prepared according to conventional pharmaceutical practices. A single dose, or preferably, 2 to 4 divided daily doses, provided on a basis of about 0.1 to 5 mg kg day, is appropriate. When each of 10 male rats of Wistar strain weighing 100 200 g was administered orally with 2000 mg kg of the compound of formula I wherein R is isobutyl, and with 1000 mg kg of the compound of formula I wherein R is 3 heptyl or isopropoxy, respectively, no death was observed. The following tests are illustrative of procedures of the biological assay for the compounds of the present invention, and the results are shown in Table 1.Test 1. Analgesic Effect 1 Acetic Acid Writhing Method Koster, Anderson and DeBeer Fed. Proc., 18, 412 1959 3 10 male ddY mice weighing 19 7 23 g were used in testing each compound The test compounds were administered orally 30 minutes before in the intraperitoneal injection 0.1 ml 10 g of 0.7 acetic acid. The number of writhes were counted in each mouse during a period spanning 10 to 20 minutes after the acetic acid injection. The percent inhibition was calculated as compared with the number of writhes in the control group, and the ED50 values were calculated from the inhibitory percent. 2 Tail Pressure Method Takagi and Kameyama Yakugaku Zasshi, 78, 553 1958 3 10 male ddY mice weighing 20 25 g were used in testing each compound. The pressure stimulus was applied to the base of the mouse tail. The test compounds were administered orally and the pain threshold was measured every 30 minutes for 120 minutes. Animals of which post drug pain threshold raised more than 50 as compared with its pre drug threshold were regarded as positive for the analgesic activity, and the ED50 values were calculated from the positive percent. 3 Randall Selitto Method Randall and Selitto Arch.Int. Pharmacodyn. 111, 409 1957 6 male Wistar rats weighing 90 110 g were used in testing each compound. The pain threshold was measured with an analgesic meter Ugo Basile . The test compounds were adminstered orally 2 hours after the subplantar injection 0.1 ml rat of 20 brewer s yeast suspension into the right hind paw, and the pain threshold was measured every 1 hour for 4 hours. Animals of which post drug pain threshold raised more than 50 as compared with the threshold in control group were regarded as positive for the analgesic activity, and the ED50 values were calculated from the positive percent. 4 Adjuvant induced Arthritic Pain Kuzuna and Kawai Chem. Pharm. Bull., 23, 1184 1975 6 male S.D. rats weighing 160 200 g were used in testing each compound. Polyarthritis was induced by the intradermal injection 0.1 ml rat of 0.5 Mycobacterium butyricum suspension into the distal portion of the tail. The pain stimulus was applied by a gentle flection of the right tarso tibial joints repeatedly 5 times at intervals 4 to 5 seconds, the vocalization following the pain stimulus was regarded as pain response. 15 to 20 days later rats that showed the pain response were selected and the test compounds were administered orally, and the pain response was measured every 1 hour for 5 hours. Animals that did not show the pain response were regareded as positive for the analgesic activity, and the ED50 values were calculated from the inhibitory percent.
