## Description
Novel compound having analgesic, antiin lammatory and antipiretic activity, process for its preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing itThe present invention relates to a novel compound endowed with interesting therapeutic activities, namely 3 methyl 3 4 acetylaminophenoxy 2,4 dioxa benzocyclohexanone l, having formula IEMI1.1 The invention relates also to a process for the preparation of compound I .Finally, object of this invention is provided by pharmaceutical compositions having analgesic, antiin flammatory and antipiretic activity containing compound I as active agent.According to the invention, this compound is obtained by reaction of acetylsalicylic acid chloride II with 4 acetylaminophenol III , in presence of proton acceptors preferably tertiary amines , at tempera tures from 10 to 40 C, preferably from 15 and 300C, according to the following scheme. EMI2.1 The following example illustrates the process according to the invention, without limiting it in.any way.Example 4 acetylaminophenol 2,3g, 0.15 moles is added to a solution of acetylsalicylic chloride 30g, 0.15 moles in chloroform 120 ml . lyridine 12 ml, 0.15 males is added dropwise under vigorous stirring, keeping the reaction temperature at 20 250 C. The reaction mixture is left at room temperature for 15 hours. The solution is washed twice with water and three times with a 5 NaOH solution. The organic phase, dried on magnesium sulphate, i8 evaporated. The residue so obtained is treated many times with a toluene ethylacetate 70 30 mixture. The solid so obtained is filtered with suction 13g of white crystals, m.p. 102 105 C. Compound I so obtained, hereinafter also defined with the abbreviation MR 897, is practically in soluble in water, soluble in alcohols and in halohydrocarbons.

It is known the therapeutic use of the two starting materials for the compound of the invention acetyl salicylic acid and 4 acetylaminophenol known as pa racetamol . In respect to them, the novel compound MR 897 has the advantage of a ready and more pro longed absorption and of an enhanced analgesic, anti inflammatory and antipiretic activity, along with total lack of the typical acetylsalicylic adid s ul cerogenic effect. It is also known a similar activi ty of the acetylsalicylate of 4 acetylaminophenyl known as Benorilate . In respect to this drug, the compound according to the invention has the advanta ges of a higher bioavailability by the oral route, which is the preferred administration form for this kind of drugs, and of a more favourable pharmacokinetics.Particularly, MR 897 exhibits a more gradual and more prolonged absorption than both acetylsalicylic acid and 4 acetylaminophenol and, lastly, acetylsalicylate of 4 acetylaminophenyl. This prolonged effect is probably due to the particular compactness of theMR 897 molecule, which is stable even at very low pH s values, and to the lack of ionizable polar groups from this last factor probably depends also the complete lack of gastric damaging activity.PharmacologyMR 897 exhibits analgesic, antiinflammatory and anti piretic activity.In comparison with the administration of equiponderant doses of benorilate, MR 897 shows higher or comparable activities in addition to a longer duration of effect.Acute toxicityThe acute toxicity of MR 897 has been carried out in mice and rats administering single doses by the oral route.Benorilate has been used as a reference standard in the same experimental conditions.The LD50 values have been calculated according to the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon J. Pharm.Exp. Therap., 1949, 96, 99 .According to the results obtained, outlined in Table 1, it has been pointed out that MR 897 has a very low acute toxicity comparable to that of Beno rilate in the used experimental conditions.Table 1 Acute toxicity of MR 897 and Benorilate SIECIES ROUTE LD50 mg kg MR 897 BENORILATE mouse 08 2300 2150 rat os 3500 3500Pharmacological activityAnti inflammatory activityThe antiinflammatory activity of MR 897 and of benorilate as reference compound has been assessed by the tesof the edema induced by carrageenin according to the method of Winter et al.

Since the weight of the two substances is the same, the dose is at the same time equimolar.The blood drawings were performed at the following times hours 0.5 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 24The evaluation of plasma levels of salicylic acid has been performed by HPLC, with an HP 1084 B chromatograph provided with automatic inlet system and with UV VIS variable wave length detector.The average values of the average plasma levels obtained are shown in the Table 6Table 6 Plasma levels of salicylic acid after administration by oral route of MR 897 and benorilate, both at the dose of 200 mWkg in the monkey equiponderant and equimolar dose .Average values in ug ml of plasma i i m e Levels of salicylic acid after admini h stration of MR 897 Benorilate 0.5 30.1 35.0 1 59.6 68.3 2 88.7 96.5 3 98.1 108.4 4 102.6 69.3 6 110.4 42.6 8 112.8 21.8 10 71.9 9.4 24 1.8 1.6 From the same result9, the area under the curve AUC has been calculated, which turned out to be the following 1AUC of MR 897 1440.6 tug ml 1.h 1AUC of benorilate 597.8piml .h As it is possible to verify, the considerable advan tages of MR 897 in comparison with benorilate become apparent.a a considerably better bioavailability ratio of MR 897 about 2.5 times higher than that of be norilate, as from relative equation 1440.6 2.41 in favour of MR 897 597.8 b an equally better trend of the pharmacokinetic curve expressed in salicylic acid concentratio ns from which it turns out that benorilate rea ches a peak at about the third hour, to decrea se thereafter rapidly, with minimal levels at about the tenth hour, while MR 897 provides a plateau from the third, to the eighth hour, de creasing thereafter almost parallely with beno rilate, but allowing high concentrations even after the tenth hours.Such behaviour, supported by pharmacodynamics data clearly show that MR 897 can be considered a compo und endowed with prolonged activity, such as to al low a considerable decrease of the administrations frequency in comparison with benorilate, spectrum and clinical efficacy being equal.Toxicity after repeated administration The toxicity after repeated administrations from 4 to 24 weeks has been studied in the rabbit, in the rats and in the dog.Tests on rabbitsBourgogne Tawny rabbits of both sexes, divided in three groups, have been treated for 4 consecutive weeks with MR 897 by rectal route at the doses of 150 300 450 mg kg die. A fourth group has been used as the control group. The examined parameters were general status and behaviour mortality body weight haernatological and haematochemical data urine histopathological founds autoptic examination weight and histological examination of main organs. From the results obtained, there is evidence that the rectal treatment with MR 897, at the employed doses, has been well tolerated both locally and sistemically.Tests on the ratThree groups of animals, males and females, have been treated by the oral route for 24 consecutive weeks with MR 897 at the following doses 150 300600 mg kg die. A fourth control group of animals has been treated only with the vehicle.According to the considered parameters, similar to those described for the tests on the rabbit, it is possible to say that doses as high as 150 300 mg kg are well tolerated. With higher doses 600 mg kg a slower body weight s increase and changes in some haematochemical data were observed. Tests on the dogBeagle dogs, males and females, divided in 4 groups have been used. The compound under study has been administered, by the oral and rectal route, for 16 consecutive weeks at the doses of 250 and 500 mg kg die. The considered parameters were general status be haviour mortality, body weight haematochemical and haematological data urine histopathological founds.From these examinations MR 897 proved to be well tolerated in all treated groups, with the exception of the group treated by oral route with 500 mg kg die those dogs, in fact, showed some changes in the haematochemical parameters. Terato genesis The possible teratogenic properties of MR 897 have been examined in the rat and in the rabbit, treated by oral or subcutaneous route.Tests on the ratThe animals have been treated with MR 897 by oral route, at the doses of 200 400 600 mg kg aie, from the 6th to the 16th day of pregnancy.At the end of pregnancy, after mothers laparatomy, the following parameters have been assessed number of pregnant females number of dead and alive phoetuses number of reabsorptions medium weight of alive phoetuses possible somatic or scheletric deformations.According to the obtained results, it is possible to say that the product MR 897 is without teratogenic activity. However, in the group treated with the highest dosage, a negative effect of MR 897 on the reproductive function must be pointed out. This effect results in an increase of the number of reabsorptions and a decrease of the medium body weight of the phoetuses.Tests on the rabbitThe animals have been treated with MR 897, from the 6th to the 18th day of pregnancy, at a dose of 300 mg kg die by oral or subcutaneous route.The considered parameters, similar to those described for the rat, showed that MR 897 causes no toxic effects, in the rabbit and at the tested dose, on the mothers and on the offspring.TolerabilitySystemic tolerability. It has been assessed in the rabbit, administering MR 897 by intraduodenal or rectal route at increasing doses up to 500 mg kg. The considered parameters arterial pressure, heart rate and ECG have been assessed at different intervals after treatments. From these tests it came out thatMR 897, at the tested doses, does not modify in any way the considered parameters.The present invention also relates to all the applicable industrial aspects connected with the use ofMR 897 as an analgesic, antiflammatory and antipiretic agent. Therefore, an essential aspect of the invention is represented by the pharmaceutical compositions containing predetermined quantities of MR 897.The compounds of the present invention can be administered via the oral, rectal or topical route, in the form of tablets, granular, monodose sachets, suppositories, ointments or creams.
