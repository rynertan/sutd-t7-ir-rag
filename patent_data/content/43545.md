# Transmission with torque converter and lock up clutch with lubrication and pressurization system.

## Abstract
An automatic transmission includes a gear trans mission mechanism which can provide several speed stages according to selective supply of hydraulic pres sures from a control system a hydraulic fluid pump a torque converter incorporating a lock up clutch which is selectively engaged or disengaged according to selec tive supply of pressure a line fluid pressure control valve which receives a supply of pressurized hydraulic fluid from the pump and which provides a supply there of, regulated to a line pressure level, to the control system and a torque converter fluid pressure control valve which receives a supply of pressurized hydraulic fluid from the pump, and which provides a supply there of to the torque converter as a source of torque con verter pressure for filling it with hydraulic fluid and for selectively either engaging or disengaging the lock up clutch, this supply of torque converter pressure being regulated to a proper level by the torque converter fluid pressure control valve, when the supply of hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic fluid pump is plentiful, diverting therefrom an overflow flow of hydraulic fluid, which, when available, is supplied to the lubricating system of the gear transmission mechanism, to which the torque converter hydraulic fluid pressure is also always sup plied via a throttle element.
