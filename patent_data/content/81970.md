# WASTE YEAST AS FEED SUPPLEMENT

## Abstract
This invention relates to feed supplement for monogastric animals comprising liquid brewers yeast containing from 0.5 to 4 by weight based on the liquid brewers yeast of an added acid formate salt in which the formate anion to cation ratio is between 2 1 and 4 1 on a chemical equivalent basis. The cations are preferably one of ammonium, sodium, potassium and calcium. The acid formates used in the present invention reduce the duration of yeast deactivation from 72 hours for propionic acid to two hours.
