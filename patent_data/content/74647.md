# Foamed chlorinated polyvinyl chloride and compositions for making same.

## Abstract
Composition of matter that can be foamed to form an expanded product having density of less than 20 lbs ftÂ³ and containing a preponderance of the cells in the size range of less than 500 microns comprising a mixture of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, 5 to 50 parts by weight of chlorofluoroal kane of 1 to 2 carbon atoms as a primary blowing agent and 0.01 to 2 parts by weight of azodicarbonamide that is dispersed through the resin and forms cell nuclei from which expanded cells are created, all based on 100 parts by weight of the resin.
