## Description
Laundry Detergent Compositions Technical FieldThe present invention relates to cleaning compositions which contain low levels of certain alkoxylated polyamines. Optionally, the compositions further contain C12 C18 fatty acids alkyl or alkenyl carboxylate materials, especially alkyl or alkenyl succinates citric acid or citrate polyester soil release agents or mixtures of these optional ingredients. BackgroundEP PA 0 112 593, published July 4,1984, describes alkoxylated amines having clay soil removal anti redeposition properties when used in detergent compositions. EP PA 0 137 615, published April 17,1985 describes solvent based liquid detergent compositions containing alkoxylated polyamines. It has now been discovered that, when used at the levels exemplified in the patent literature, the alkoxylated amines may negatively affect overall cleaning performance. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide cleaning oompositions which contain alkoxylated polyamine clay soil remrval anti redeposition agents at levels high enough to provide the desired benefit, while not having or significant negative effect on other performance parameters. Summary of the InventionThe present invention relates to detergent copositions designed especially for laundering fabrics. Said compositions may be formulated in liquid, solid, or granular form the liquid form is preferred and such liquid form compositions are hereinafter referred to as heavy duty liquids or HDL S since they are designed to remove even the heavies soil loads from fabrics when used in a conventional laundering operation.Specifically, this invention relates to laundry detergent compositions comprising conventional detersive surfactants and, optionally, conventional deters ivy adjuncts, characterized in that they contain from 0.1 to 0.9 , preferably from 0.3 to 0.7 , of an alkoxylated polyamine of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R is hydrocarbyl having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms,R is C1 to C20 hydrobarbon, alkoxy is selected from ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, or mixtures thereof, wherein y is 2 30, n is an integer of at least 2, and is an anion. Detailed description of the Invention The e present invention is based on the discovery that art disclosed alkoxylated amine compounds, when used in detergent compositions at levels exemplified in the art, tend to negatively affect the overall cleaning performance of such compositions. The negative effects tend to occur when the detergent compositions are used under stress conditions, e.g. high water hardness more than 20 gpg, or more than about 3.4 mmol Ca per liter , and or high fabric softener load of the fabric, and or low clay soil load.It has now been discovered that detergent compositions can be formulated which contain the alkoxy polyamine compounds at relatively low levels, whereby the intended performance benefit is obtained without causing undesirable side effects, even under stress conditions. The e detergent compositions are described in more detail hereinafter. All percentages and ratios mentioned in this specification are by weight, unless otherwise specified. PolyaminesAlkoxylated polyamines suitable as clay soil removal anti redeposition agents, as well as their preparation, are disclosed in EP PA 0 112 593, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.It is to be understood that the term wpolyaminesw as used herein represents generically the alkoxylated polyamines, both in their amine form and in their quaternarized form.Such materials can conveniently be represented as molecules of the empirical structures with repeating units EMI4.1 Amine formEMI4.2 Quaternized formWherein R is a hydrocarbyl group, usually of 2 6 carbon atoms R1 may be a C1 C20 hydrocarbon the alkoxy groups are ethoxy, propoxy, and the like, and y is 2 30, most preferably 10 20 n is an integer of at least 2, preferably from 2 20, most preferably 3 5 and X is an anion such as halide or methylsulfate, resulting from the quaternization reaction.The e most highly preferred polyamines for use herein are the so called ethoxylated polyethylene imines, i.e., the polymerized reaction product of ethylene oxide with ethylene imine, having the general formula EMI5.1 wherein n is an integer of 3 to 5 and y is an integer of 10 to 20.Surfactants In addition to the polyamine, the compositions herein contain organic surface active agents surfactants to provide the usual cleaning benefits associated with the use of such materials.Water soluble detersive surfactants useful herein include well known synthetic anionic, non ionic, amphoter ic and zwitterionic surfactants. Typical of these are the alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl and alkylether sulfates, paraffin sulfonates, oleo in sulfonates, alkoxylated especially ethoxylated alcohols and alkyl phenols, amine oxides, alpha sulfonates of fatty acids and of fatty acid esters, and the like, which are well known from the detergency art. In general, such detersive surfactants contain an alkyl group in the Cg Cl8 range the anionic detersive surfactants are most comnonly used in the form of their sodium, potassium or triethanolammonium salts the nonionics generally contain from about 5 to about 17 ethylene oxide groups. U.S.Patent 4.111.855 contains detailed listings of such typical detersive surfactants. C11 C16 alkyl benzene sulfonates, C12 C18 paraffin sulfonates and alkyl sulfates, and the ethoxylated alcohols and alkyl phenols are especially preferred in the compositions of the present type. The e surfactant component can comprise as little as 1 of the compositions herein, but preferably the compositions will contain I to 40 , preferably 5 to 30 , of surfactant. Mixtures of the ethoxylated nonionics with anionics such as the alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and paraffin sulfonates are preferred for through the wash cleansing of a broad spectrum of soils and stains from fabrics.Fatty Acid Soap Ingredient Fatty acids generallyC12 C18 chain length and their water soluble salts i.e., common soaps , especially alkali metal soaps can be used in the present compositions not only for their detersive surfactant properties, but also to provide an additional detergency builder function by virtue of their ability to interact with water hardness cations. For these reasons, the fatty acids are highly desirable components of the compositions herein. mey are typically used at 5 30 by weight of the composition. Optional Ingredients The compositions herein can contain other ingredients which aid in their cleaning performance. For example, it is highly preferred that detergent compositions contain a detergent builder and or metal ion sequestrant. Compounds classifiable and well known in the art as detergent builders include the nitr ilotr iacetates, polyearboxylates, citrates, water soluble phosphates such as tri polyphosphate and sodium ortho and pyrophosphates, silicates, and mixtures thereof. Metal ion seguestrants include all of the above, plus materials like ethylenediaminetetraacetate, the amino polyphosphonates and phosphates DBQUEST and a wide variety of other poly functional organic acids and salts too numerous to mention in detail here. See U.S.Patent 3.579.454 for typical examples of the use of such materials in various cleaning compositions. In general, the builder sequestrant will comprise about 0.5 to 15 of the composition. Citrate is one of the most preferred builders since it is readily soluble in the aqueous phase of heavy duty liquid detergent compositions.Other examples of suitable builders are those of the general formula R CH COCH CH2 COCH i.e. derivatives of succinic acid, wherein R is C10 C20 alkyl or alkenyl, preferably C12 C16, or wherein R may be substituted with hydroxyl, sulfo, sulfoxy or sulfone substituents.The succinate builders are preferably used in the form of their water soluble salts, including the sodium, potassium, amnonium and alkanolamnonium Salts.Specific examples of succinate builders include lauryl succinate, myristyl succinate, palmityl succinate, 2 dodecenyl succinate preferred , 2 pentadecenyl succinate, and the like.The compositions herein also preferably contain enzymes to enhance their through the wash cleaning performance on a variety of soils and stains. Amylase and protease enzymes suitable for use in detergents are well known in the art and in commercially available liquid and granular detergents. Commercial detersive enzymes preferably a mixture of amylase and protease are typically used at levels of 0.001 to 2 , and higher, in the present compositions. Ingredients such as propane diol and or formate, calcium and boric acid, can be added to help stabilize the enzymes in well known fashion, according to the desires of the formulator. The e compositions therein also preferably contain soil release polymers having the generic formulaEMI8.1 in which X can be any suitable capping group, with each X being selected from the group consisting of H, and alkyl or acyl groups containing from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, in particular methyl. n is selected for water solubility and generally is from about 6 to about 120, preferably from about 10 to about 50. u is critical to formulation in a liquid detergent having a relatively high ionic strength. There should be little material, preferably, less than 5 , having u greater than 5. Furthermore, the weight average value of u preferably is in the range of from 1 to 2. The e R1 moieties are essentially 1,4 phenylene moieties. As used herein, the term Zthe R1 moieties are essentially 1,4 pbenylene moieties refers to compounds where the R1 moieties consist entirely of 1,4 phenylene moieties, or are partially substituted with other arylene or alkarylene moieties, alkylene moieties, alkenylene moieties, or mixtures thereof. Arylene and alkarylene moieties which can be partially substituted for 1,4 phenylene include 1, 3 phenylene, 1 ,2 phenylene, 1, 8 naphtylene, 1, 4 naphtylene, 2,2 b ipherlene, 4,4 biphenylene and mixtures thereof.Alkylene and alkenylene moieties which can be partially substituted include ethylene, 1,2 propylene, 1,4 butylene, 1,5 pentylene, 1, 6 hexamethylene, 1 ,7 heptamethylene, 1,8 octamethylene, 1,4 cyclohexylene, and mixtures thereof. For the R1 moieties, the degree of partial substitution with moieties other than 1,4 phenylene should be such that the soil release properties of the compound are not adversely affected to any great extent. Generally, the degree of partial substitution which can be tolerated will depend upon the backbone length of the compound, i.e., longer backbones can have greater partial substitution for 1,4 phenylene moieties. Usually, compounds where the R1 comprise from about 50 to 100 1,4 phenylene moieties from 0 to about 50 moieties other than 1,4 phenylene have adequate soil release activity. For example, polyesters made according to the present invention with a 40 60 mole ratio of isophtalic 1,3 phenylene to terephtalic 1,4 phenylene acid have adequate soil release activity.However, because most polyesters used in fiber making comprise ethylene terephthalate units, it is usually desirable to minimize the degree of partial substitution with moieties other than 1,4 phenylene for best soil release activity. Preferably, the R1 moieties consist entirely of i.e., comprise 100 1,4 phenylene moieties, i.e. each R1 moiety is 1,4 phenylene. Irrespective of the mechanism of action, it is surprising that the soil release polymers do show excellent benefits on fabrics other than polyester fabrics and the compositions herein are designed to clean all manner of fabrics and textiles. For the R2 moieties, suitable ethylene or substituted ethylene moieties include ethylene, 1,2 propylene, 1,2 butylene, 1,2 hexylene, 3 methoxy l, 2 propylene and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the R2 moieties are essentially ethylene moieties, 1,2 propylene moieties or mixtures thereof. Inclusion of a greater percentage of ethylene moieties tends to improve the soil release activity of the compounds. Surprisingly, inclusion of a greater percentage of 1,2 propylene moieties tends to improve the water solubility of the compounds. Moreover, the compositions herein can contain, in addition to ingredients already mentioned, various other optional ingredients typically used in commercial products to provide aesthetic or additional product performance benefits. Typical ingredients include pE regulants, perfumes, dyes, bleaches, optical brighteners, soil suspending agents, hydrotropes and gel control agents, freeze thaw stabilizers, bactericides, preservatives, suds control agents, bleach activators and the like.In a through the wash laundry mode, the compositions are typically used at a concentration of at least 500 ppn, preferably 0.10 to 2.5 , in an aqueous laundry bath at pH 7 11 to launder fabrics. The e laundering can be carried out by agitating fabrics with the present compositions over the range from 50C to the boil, with excellent results.
