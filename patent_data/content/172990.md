# Two component syringe assembly.

## Abstract
A two component syringe 20 includes a barrel 21 having a chamber 22 for retaining fluid 44 and a distal end 25 of the barrel 21 having a passageway 26 there through communicating with the chamber 22 . A by pass stopper 31 is slidably positioned in fluid tight engagement inside the barrel 21 . The stopper 31 has a distal rib contacting the barrel 21 , a recess on the proximal side of the rib and a groove in the rib for allowing fluid communica tion between the recess and the chamber 22 . This groove is positioned angularly with respect to the longitudinal ac cess of the barrel 21 so that liquid passing therethrough is directed angularly with respect to the longitudinal axis of the barrel 21 . The barrel 21 also includes a raised peripheral portion serving as a by pass and defining a by pass zone 34 . The by pass zone 34 is shorter than the length of the stopper 31 along the longitudinal axis of the barrel 21 . The by pass 34 is sufficiently long and raised enough to allow liquid to flow around the stopper 31 bet ween the proximal end of the stopper 31 and the recess when the proximal end of the stopper 31 is positioned in the by pass zone 34 . Also included is a piston 36 slidably positioned in fluid tight engagement inside the barrel 21 . This piston 36 is adapted to engage a plunger rod 37 to facilitate its operation.
