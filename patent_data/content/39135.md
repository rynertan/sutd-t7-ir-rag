# PRODUCTION OF AMMONIUM METATUNGSTATE

## Abstract
Ammonium metatungstate is produced by contacting the anolyte side of a cation exchange membrane with an aqueous solution of ammonium tungstate and applying an electrical potential across the membrane such as to effect the transport of ammonium ions from said solution through the membrane to lower the pH of the solution to a level at which ammonium metatungstate is formed.
