# Text processing system with communications data save facility.

## Abstract
In a text processor including a communications facility, different tasks, such as typing tasks and communications tasks are entered into the machine from different program diskettes. As each is so entered, in view of the fact that main memory space is limited, it overlays control data in the main memory relating to the previous task. In a communications session, the operator has to build a queue of documents for sending under the control of communications foreground control CFC and communications background control CBC blocks in the main memory. If the operator is required to terminate this task before its completion, his queue data is lost as it is overlaid by control data relating to a new task that is entered, so on return to the communications task, he has to start from the beginning. In order to enable him to exit the communications task without losing the queue data, an arrangement is employed whereby this data can be entered on to the communications program diskette prior to termina tion of a communications session.
