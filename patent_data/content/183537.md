# Borehole device actuated by fluid pressure.

## Abstract
Apparatus for actuating a tool downhole in a borehole includes a body 14, 15, 22, 23, 28 a port 48 to admit fluid pressure into the body and apparatus within the body in fluid pressure communication with the port for actuating the tool in response to a a fluid pressure level communicated through the port in excess of a first fluid pressure level greater than the hydrostatic pressure level, followed by b a decrease in the fluid pressure level communicated through the port from the first fluid pressure level to a second fluid pressure level less than the first fluid pressure level.
