# FUEL INJECTION PUMP FOR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE HAVING IMPROVED EXCESS FUEL DISCHARGER

## Abstract
Disclosed is a fuel injection pump arranged such that a movable free piston 5 is provided in a high pressure fuel chamber, and a first compression chamber 4 partitioned by the piston is supplied with fuel for determining the amount of fuel to be injected, while a second compression chamber 6 is supplied with fuel for determining injection timing, then fuel is compressed by means of a rotary com pressor mechanism, and the fuel highly compressed in the second compression chamber 6 is supplied to cylinders of an internal combustion engine, wherein the above mentioned free piston 5 has a valve mechanism which opens when the piston moves toward the second com pression chamber 6 , thereby to abruptly release the fuel for regulating injection timing compressed in the second compression chamber 6 .
