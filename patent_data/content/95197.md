## Abstract
Apparatus and process for the vaporization of a heavy hydrocarbon feedstock with steam. The apparatus comprises a first tubular element 2 and a second tubular element 3 surrounding the first tubular element 2 to form an annular space 8 , means 4 for introducing a heavy hydrocarbon feedstock into the first tubular element 2 , means 7 for introducing superheated steam into the annular space 8 , the first and second tubular elements 2, 3 being provided with open ends for the supply of the superheated steam as an annulus around a core of the heavy hydrocarbon feedstock, a frusto conically shaped element 10 connected to the open end of the second tubular element 3 . To avoid coke formation in the apparatus the frusto conically shaped element 10 diverges in a direction away from the second tubular element 3 and has an apex angle of at most 20 degrees.
