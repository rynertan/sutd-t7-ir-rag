# Hydropneumatic accumulator.

## Abstract
A hydraulic device especially a hydropneumatic piston accumulator, the freely displaceable piston of which divides the cylinder into a liquid and a gas chamber. In order to reduce the friction and the heat release connected therewith and at the same time guarantee an effective sealing it is suggested that the piston 12 during its initial or terminal movement close to its end position is arranged to cooperate with a sec ond sealing member 23 and 20 resp. at the end wall 14 of the liquid chamber 17 by means of a first sealing member 20 or 23 resp , and that between said sealing members 20, 23 a friction sealing 21 being arranged for preventing any flow of liquid from the piston to an inlet 16 at the end wall 14 but permitting flow of liquid in the opposite direction and besides the first sealing member 20 or 23 resp is limitedly axially displaceable in relation to the piston.
