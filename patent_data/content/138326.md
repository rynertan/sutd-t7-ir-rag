## Description
METHOD AND COMPOSITION FOR JOINING OPTICAL FIBERSBackground of the Invention This invention is in the field of joining or splicing optical fibers together. There are numerous methods, devices and techniques that have been used for splicing optical fibers to obtain the maximum optical coupling efficiency between the ends of the two fibers being joined together. Among the devices that have been used are groved plates in which the optical fibers are placed to align the fibers. The plates holding the optical fibers are then connected mechanically to align the fibers. Tubes have been used by inserting the ends of the fibers into the tube then joining the fibers.Machines have also been used to mechanically align and hold the fibers in proper position until they can be joined. The conventional methods used for joining or splicing optical fibers include fusion of the fibers and joining the fibers with of adhesive compositions. The adhesive compositions which have been used to join optical fibers together have been catalitically cured compositions, photo cured compositions, thermoset compositions and thermoplastic compositions. All of the devices, methods and compositions conventionally used to splice optical fibers have the common objective of obtaining the maximum optical coupling efficiency between the optical fibers being joined together. The conventional criteria for such splicing has been for refractive index matching not only the optical fibers being joined together but between the optical fibers and any adhesive or other coating composition that is used to assist in the splice. It is generally recognized that for an optical fiber splice to be acceptable, there should be no more than 0.3 db attenuation in the light being transmitted between the optical fibers joined together.General Description of the Invention This invention is directed to adhesive compositions for joining or splicing optical fibers which will withstand conditions encountered in commercial field use where the compositions are used. This invention is also directed to methods and adhesive compositions which provide an optical fiber splice which will withstand the conditions encountered in commercial use. The mere matching of refractive index and obtaining the maximum optical coupling efficiency of an optical fiber splice under controlled conditions is not sufficient for the conditions encountered in commercial use. The conditions encountered in commercial installations of optical fiber cables, whether in underground or aerial applications, involve constant temperature cycling as well as high humidity conditions. Other installations will involve fairly constant temperatures, which are sometimes elevated temperatures. The methods and adhesive compositions of this invention provide optical fiber splices which will maintain an acceptable optical coupling efficiency through one or more of the following three tests. The first test involves subjecting the optical fiber splice to temperature cycles of from about 30eC to about 60 C. The optical coupling efficiency is monitored continuously during this test because in field conditions the optical fiber will be in constant use during changes in temperature. The desired optical coupling efficiency is maintained through this temperature range when cycled from ambient temperature to the extremes of this temperature range and back to ambient temperature for three of these full temperature cycles in 24 hours through at least ten cycles. Thus, this invention provides the adhesive composition and means for maintaining the acceptable coupling efficiency of the optical fiber splice through the temperature extremes encountered in commercial installations of optical fiber cables. The second test reflects conditions of high relative humidity which is frequently encountered in commercial installations of optical fiber cables. The methods and adhesive compositions of this invention provide means of maintaining acceptable coupling efficiency of the optical fiber splice at 95 relative humidity at 400C for at least 10 days. The third test reflects the conditions of sustained elevated temperatures which is frequently encountered in commercial installations of optical fiber cables. The methods and adhesive compositions of this invention enable a splice in an optical fiber to maintain acceptable coupling efficiency at a temperature of 70 C for at least seven days. Other properties which are essential for commercial use of optical fiber splicing methods and compositions include the requirement that the composition used to join the wends of the optical fiber have sufficient shelf life at temperatures and conditions encountered during manufacture, storage, shipping, storage in the field frequently in a service truck , handling and final use.The adhesive compositions of this invention also provide the desired viscosity for handling and alignment of the optical fibers, The desired ease of use, including curing or setting time, for the composition for efficient field use are also provided by the adhesive compositions and methods of this invention. The compositions of this invention remain stable and usable when stored at 60 C for three months. This is an indication that the compositions will be usable under ordinary commercial conditions for about one year or more. The viscosity of the composition is one of the more critical properties which is satisfied by the adhesive compositions of this invention. If the viscosity is too low, the physical shock during handling of the compositions before they are used will form bubbles in the composition.The bubbles will then interfere with obtaining the maximum efficiency of the optical fiber coupling. In addition, one of the preferred methods of using the compositions of this invention is to place the composition in a tube suitable for receiving the ends of the optical fibers to be spliced. The adhesive composition is stored in the tube until ready for use then used by inserting the ends of the optical fibers into the tube. If the viscosity is too low, the adhesive will not remain in the tube and bubbles may be induced into the composition during handling. If the viscosity is too high it is difficult to align the optical fibers properly before the composition is cured. The compositions of this invention provide appropriate viscosities between about 200 centipoise and about 5,000 centipoise.The adhesive compositions of this invention have viscosities within this acceptable range at the temperatures encountered in the commercial use of these compositions in the field. The adhesive compositions of this invention provide the cure times and convenience of use normally desired for commercial installation. The adhesive compositions of this invention are preferably used with a conventional photo initiator which is compatible with the compositions and cured by radiation with conventional active light sources. In this method the composition is generally cured under about two minutes and most cure under about one minute with the use of a low pressure mercury vapor lamp, such as one having an output of 10 x l0 2 milliwatts per cm2, or a xenon arc lamp, which provide the required UV radiation. Another property the adhesive compositions of this invention have which contributes to the function of these adhesive compositions in maintaining the maximum coupling efficiency between the optical fibers is shrinkage of less than 20 and typically a shrinkage of about 10 or less. In connection with the shrinkage the adhesive compositions of this invention exhibit good release from other substrates, such as the walls of the tubes referred to above, particularly if a release coating is placed on the walls of the tube holding the composition. Specific description of the Invention The method provided by this invention for joining or splicing optical fibers comprises aligning the ends of the fibers to be joined, applying to the fiber ends an adhesive composition comprising a polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate monomer having three to seven acrylate or methacrylate groups and curing the polyfunctional monomer to bond the fiber ends in fixed relationship to each other. The polyfunctional monomers useful in the method of this invention have from three to seven acrylate or methacrylate groups appended to a backbone having 3 to 30 carbon atoms. The backbone of the monomer may be straight or branched chain alkyl, straight or branched chain oxyalkyl, aryl, hetrocyclic nitrogen ring or combinations thereof. Examples of these polyfunctional monomers are trimethylolpropanetriacrylate, pentaerythritoltetraacrylate, dipentaerythritolmonohydroxypentaacrylate, dipentaerythitolhexacrylate, tris 2 hydroixyethyl isocynanurate, trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate and pentaerythritoltrimethacrylate.

The adhesive compositions of this invention generally preferred to satisfy the commercial use requirement described above comprise a tri or tetra acrylate or methacrylate monomer in combination with a dicarylate or dimethacrylate monomer in a weight ratio of between about 3 2 and about 9 1, respectively, with the preferred weight ration being between about 8.5 1.5 and about 7 3. The adhesive compositions of this invention may be cured by heat, by use of catalysts, or by incorporating a photo initiator and applying appropriate light. The heat curing is sometimes slower than desired in commercial use. The catalytic curing usually is not convenient in that it requires mixing the catalyst with the adhesive composition just before use. The preferred way of curing the adhesive compositions this invention is by incorporating a photo initiator and curing with actinic light. Photo initiators of the type useful in this invention are those which are compatible with the compositions of this invention and include the benzoin ether type, such as benzoin methyl ether or benzoin isopropyl ether, substituted benzoin ethers such as anisoin methyl ether, substituted acetophenones such as 2,2 diethoxyacetophenone, or 2,2 dimethoxy 2phenylacetophenone, and substituted alpha ketols such as 2 methyl 2 hydroxipropiophenone, isobutyl benzoin ether, 2 hydroxy 2 methyl l phenyl propan l one, isopropryl benzoin ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin methyl ether, benzil, hydroxy cyclohexyl phenyl ketone, isopropyl thioxanthone, chlorine functional substituted benzophenone Acetocure X 500 , halogen substituted alkyl alkylketone Sandoray 1000 .

The tube is then taped closed for storage, transportation and handling. At the time of use the tape is removed from the ends of the tube, the optical fibers are inserted in the tube and aligned.The adhesive composition is cured by radiation with actinic light. It is further preferred that a zone curing technique be used to focus the light to first cure the adhesive composition at the center portion of the tube where the ends of the optical fibers are aligned, then cure the remaining portion of the adhesive composition extending in each direction from the center portion of the tube, thereby curing the remaining adhesive composition around the optical fibers.
