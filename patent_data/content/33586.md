## Description
This invention relates to a device for limiting the extent of current leakage which may occur during operation of an electrolytic cell, and in particular to a device for limiting the extent of current leakage which occurs during feeding of electrolyte to such a cell and or during the removal of the liquid products of electrolysis from such a cell. The production of chemical products by the electrolysis of solutions of ionisable chemical compounds, hereinafter generally referred to as electrolytes, is widely practiced in industry. For example, the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal halide to produce halogen and an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of sodium chloride to produce chlorine and an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, is practiced industrially on a vast scale. Electrolytic cells for the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride solutions generally are of three basic types, mercury cells, diaphragm cells, and membrane cells.In a mercury cell an aqueous solution chloride solution is charged to a cell comprising a flowing mercury cathode and anodes which may be of graphite but which in modern practice are generally made of a filmforming metal, e.g. titanium, having an electroconducting electrocatalytically active coating thereon, and sodium ions and chloride ions are liberated in the electrolysis, chlorine and a sodium amalgam being removed from the cell.Aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is produced by reacting the sodium amalgam with water in a denuder and the depleted amalgam is returned to the electrolytic cell. In a diaphragm cell comprising anodes and cathodes separated by hydraulically permeable diaphragms, for example, asbestos diaphragms, to form separate anode and cathode compartments, the aqueous sodium chloride solution is charged to the anode compartments of the cell where it is electrolysed and chlorine is removed from the anode compartments and an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide containing sodium chloride is removed from the cathode compartments of the cell.In a membrane cell comprising anodes and cathodes separated by hydraulically impermeable ion perm selective membranes to form separate anode and cathode compartments the aqueous sodium chloride solution is charged to the anode compartments of the cell where it is is electrolysed and chlorine is removed from the anode compartments and an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is removed from the cathode compartments of the cell. During use of electrolytic cells an electrolyte, for example aqueous sodium chloride solution, is charged from a reservoir of electrolyte at earth potential to the cell which is at a different electrical potential. The liquid products of electrolysis, for example, an aqueous solution containing sodium hydroxide, are discharged from the cell to a reservoir at earth potential designed to receive the liquid products and there is a difference in electrical potential between the electrolytic cell and the product reservoir.Because of this difference in electrical potential there may be a leakage of current between the electrolytic cell and the reservoir from which the electrolyte is charged to the cell, and between the electrolytic cell and the reservoir to which the liquid products of electrolysis are discharged from the cell. The leakage of current occurs particularly where a continuous stream of electrolyte is charged to the electrolytic cell and or where a continuous stream of the liquid products of electrolysis are discharged from the cell, the continuous streams providing a pathway for leakage of current.Whilst the leakage of current may not of itself be particularly serious in terms of the overall electrical energy required to carry out the electrolysis it does lead to serious corrosion problems in the electrolytic cell, and in particular in those parts of the cell through which the electrolyte is charged to the cell and through which the liquid products of electrolysis are discharged from the cell. Leakage of current and the associated corrosion problem is particularly severe in a installation comprising a large number of individual electrolytic cells to which electrical current is supplied in series, for example in an installation comprising a large number of membrane or diaphragm cells arranged in series. In such an installation certain of the cells, and in particular those at or near the ends of the series, will be at a high potential relative to earth, that is at a high positive or negative potential depending on the position of a particular cell in the series.For example, in a diaphragm cell installation for the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride solution comprising 100 individual cells arranged in series there may be a potential difference of as much as 200 volts between the cells at or near the ends of the series and earth. Thus, the leakage of current, and the associated corrosion problem, is particularly severe in the electrolytic cells at or near the ends of such a series. Various prior proposals haye been made to decrease the extent of this current leakage and the associated corrosion problem. For example, in Japanese patent publicationNo 53061591 on electrolytic cell for the electrolysis of alkali metal chloride solution is described in which it is proposed to discharge the liquor from the cell in a discontinuous manner by forming the liquor into droplets in a device comprising a plurality of small diameter tubes or rods. InJapanese patent publication No 53061592 it has been proposed to provide electrodes in a liquor discharging pipe in order to reduce the difference in electrical voltage at the outlet to less than 10 volts in order to suppress corrosion. InBritish Patent No 1523045 it has been proposed to so choose the lengths and diameters of the electrolyte feed and discharge pipes as to limit the current leakage per cell to not more than 4 of the electrolysis current per cell. The present invention relates to a particularly convenient device for use in charging electrolyte to an electrolytic cell and or for use in discharging the liquid products of electrolysis from an electrolytic cell The device is easy to operate and provides a discontinuous pathway for the electrolyte and or the liquid products of electrolysis.Thus use ofthe device results in a considerable reduction in the leakage of current from an electrolytic cell with consequent considerable reduction in the extent of the corrosion associated with such current leakage. The present invention provides a device, suitable for limiting the extent of current leakage which may occur during operation of an electrolytic cell, the device comprising a vessel having two or more separate compartments therein which are electrically insulated from each other, means for charging liquid sequentially to the compartments of the vessel, means for discharging liquid sequentially from the compartments of the vessel, the said charging and discharging means being operatively connected so that, in operationof the device,iliquid may be charged to a compartment of the vessel whilst liquid is discharged from a different and separate compartment of the vessel. , In operating the device of the invention liquid is charged to a compartment of the vessel whilst liquid is discharged from a separate and different compartment of the vessel. ashen these charging and discharging steps have been completed the chargig of liquid is switched to another compartment of the vessel, for example to that compartment which has just been discharged of liquid, and a different and separate compartment of the vessel is discharged of liquid, for example that compartment which has just been charged with liquid. As liquid is charged to and discharged from different and separate compartments of the vessel, use of the device thus provides a flow of liquid, for example from a reservoir of electrolyte to an electrolytic cell and or from an electrolytic cell to a reservoir for the liquid products of electrolysis, without at the same time providing a continuous liquid path between the reservoirs and the electrolytic cell. Thus, use of the device results in a considerable reduction in the extent of current leakage. In order to prevent leakage of current between the compartments of the vessel the compartments must be electrically insulated from each other, and suitably the vessel is made of an electrically non conducting material. It is to be understood that by separate compartments in the vessel of the device we mean compartments between which there is substantially no connecting liquid pathway. The device of the invention is particularly suitable for use with an electrolytic cell, although its use is not so limited. It may be used for example with electrolytic cells of the types hereinbefore specifically described, although it is to be understood that the device of the invention may be used with any electrolytic cell in which an electrolyte is electrolysed, and it is not limited to use with electrolytic cells for the electrolysis of solutions of alkali metal halides. Thus, electrolyte may be charged to an electrolytic cell through a device of the invention and or liquid products of electrolysis may be discharged from an electrolytic cell through a device of the invention. In a preferred embodiment of the device of the invention the vessel comprises two compartments electrically insulated from each other. In operating this preferred device liquid is charged to a first compartment of the vessel whilst liquid is discharged from a second compartment of the vessel, and thereafter liquid is charged to the second compartment of the vessel whilst liquid is discharged from the first compartment of the vessel. In a more preferred embodiment of the device of the invention the vessel comprises two compartments, is pivotally mounted about an axis, and is provided with means for limiting the extent of travel of the vessel about the axis, e.g stop members. In operating this more preferred embodiment of the device of the invention liquid is charged to a first compartment of the pivotally mounted vessel positioned at the limit of travel of the vessel about its axis in one direction and a first compartment is charged with liquid. The vessel is then pivoted about its axis to the limit of travel in the other direction and a second compartment is charged with liquid whilst the first compartment is discharged of liquid, for example, merely by the liquid overflowing from the first compartment. Although the vessel may be caused to pivot about its axis by use of suitable driving means, e.g. a motor, the pivoting motion may occur automatically merely by the act of filling and discharging of the compartments of the vessel. Thus, the shapes and dimensions of the compartments of the vessel may be so chosen that when a first compartment is charged with liquid the vessel is eventually caused to pivot about its axis thereby causing discharge of the liquid from the first. compartment. The second compartment is then charged with liquid and as the second compartment is filled the vessel is eventually caused to pivot about its axis in the opposite direction thereby causing discharge of liquid from the second compartment. Thereafter the sequence of filling and discharging the compartments of the vessel is repeated. The charging means for charging liquid to the vessel may be in a fixed position such that movement of the vessel, for example pivoting of the vessel about its axis, brings the compartments of the vessel sequentially into position to receive liquid from the charging means. The charging means may be a pipe leading from a reservoir of electrolyte and the discharge from the device may lead to a pipe through which the electrolyte may be charged to an electrolytic cell. Alternatively the charging means may be a pipe leading from an electrolytic cell and through which the liquid products of electrolysis may be charged to the divice, and the discharge from the device may lead to a pipe through which the liquid products of electrolysis may be removed from the device. The vessel is suitably made of an electrically non conducting material. For example, the vessel may be made of a plastics material. The plastics material should not be degraded by the liquid charged to the vessel and choice of the material will be governed accordingly. Suitable materials may readily be selected bearing in mind the nature of, for example, the electrolyte and or the products of electrolysis charged to and discharged from the vessel. For example, in a cell in which an alkali metal halide is electrolysed the alkali metal hydroxide solution discharged from the cell may be corrosive as it may be at a temperature of about 900C and it may have a concentration of 30 by weight or greater.In this case a suitable material of construction for the vessel is polypropylene, poly vinyl chloride or a fluorine containing polymer, e.g poly vinylidene fluoride or poly tetrafluoroethylene.It is preferred that the material of construction of the vessel is one which shows little or no tendancy for a film of liquid to spread over the surfaces of the vessel and which thus does not provide a liquid pathway for current leakage between the separate compartments of the vessel.For this latter reason it is preferred that the vessel is constructed of polypropylene or a fluorine containing polymer in the case where the liquid charged to and discharged from the vessel is an aqueous alkali metal chloride or alkali metal hydroxide solution. The more preferred embodiment of the device of the invention comprising a vessel having two compartments is simple in construction and easy to operate. Furthermore, it is capable of operating over a large range of rates of liquid flow substantially independently of the rate of liquid flow. Also, provided the capacities of the compartments in the vessel are known the more preferred embodiment of the device of the invention possesses the further advantage that it may itself be used to measure the rate of liquid flow merely by observing the time taken for the vessel to pivot about its axis in a one direction and then return to its original position by pivoting about its axis in the opposite direction. The invention provides a device comprising a vessel pivotally mounted about an axis and having two separate compartments therein electrically insulated from each other, means for limiting the extent of travel about the axis, and means for charging a liquid to the vessel so positioned that at the limit of travel of the vessel about the axis in a first direction liquid, when charged to the vessel, is directed to a first compartment, and liquid, when present in a second compartment, is discharged therefrom, and at the limit of travel of the vessel about the axis in the opposite direction liquid, when charged to the vessel, is directed to the second compartment, and liquid, when present in the first compartment, is discharged therefrom. The invention also provides an electrolytic cell incorporating one or more devices of the invention through which electrolyte may be charged to the cell and or liquid products of electrolysis may be discharged from the cell. An embodiment of the device will now be described with the aid of the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation in elevation of a device of the invention, andFigures 2 and 3 are further views of the device shown in Figure 1 illustrating the mode of operation of the device. Referring to Figure 1 the device comprises a container 1 having a top 2 , in which there is positioned a pipe 3 , and a base 4 which is inclined slightly to the horizontal and which leads to a pipe 5 . Within the container there is positioned a vessel 6 constructed of polypropylene and comprising two open topped compartments 7,8 having bases 9, 10 and a dividing wall 11 . The vessel is pivotally mounted on a bar 12 which is positioned between and which is fixed to the side walls not shown of the container. Stop bars 13, 14 are similarly positioned between and fixed to the side walls of the container, the stop bars limiting the extent of the travel of the vessel about the axis of the bar 12 in the directions indicated by the arrows A,B . Operation of the device of the invention will be described with reference to a diaphragm type electrolytic cell for the production of halogen and a diaphragm cell liquor, that is an aqueous solution containing sodium hydroxide and sodium chloride, by the electrolysis of an aqueous sodium chloride solution. Referring to Figure 2 the vessel 6 is pivotted about the axis of the bar 12 in the direction indicated by arrow A , so that the vessel engages the stop bar 13 , thereby limiting the extent of travel of the vessel, and the compartment 7 of the vessel is positioned below the pipe 3 .Diaphragm cell liquor from the cathode compartment of an electrolytic cell not shown flows down the pipe 3 and enters the compartment 7 of the vessel 6 . The amount of liquor in the compartment 7 progressively increases and the vessel 6 is eventually caused to pivot about the axis of the bar 12 in the direction indicated by the arrow B and to assume the position indicated in Figure 3 with the vessel engaging the stop bar 14 . The liquor in the compartment 7 is thus discharged and runs down the inclined base 4 of the container 1 and out of the container 1 via the pipe 5 , and the compartment 8 of the vessel 6 is positioned below the pipe 3 and receives liquor discharged from the pipe 3 .The amount of liquor in the compartment 8 progressively increases and the vessel 6 is eventually caused to pivot about the axis of the bar 12 in the direction indicated by the arrow A so that the vessel engages the stop bar 12 and the liquor in compartment 8 is discharged therefrom. Thereafter the sequence of charging liquor to compartments 7 and 8 and discharging of liquor from compartments 8 and 7 respectively is repeated. The base 4 of the container may have a suitable profile, for example a sloping profile, in order to minimise the extent of splashing of the liquor discharged from the compartments 7,8 . If splashing does occur there may be, but at most for only a very short period of time, a continuous liquid pathway formed through the device with consequent very small current leakage. The device of the invention described with reference to Figures 1,2 and 3 was used to receive the diaphragm cell liquor from an electrolytic cell and to discharge the liquor to a reservoir therefore.The cell was equipped with a titanium anode having a coating of a mixture of RuOz and TiO2 35 weight Ru02 and 65 weight Tit2 a mild steel cathode, and a porous asbestos diaphragm.In the cell an aqueous solution of sodium chloride 305 g l was electrolysed at a current density 2 of 2KA m , a temperature of 950C and a pH of 3.8, and the diaphragm cell liquor produced contained 9 by weight of sodium hydroxide and 15 by weight of sodium chloride. The electrolytic cell was at the end of a line of 100 cells connected in series and there was a 175 volt difference in potential between the cell and the reservoir at earth. After 3 months of continuous operation the mild steel pipe carrying the discharge of diaphragm cell liquor to the device of the invention was found to show notsigns of corrosion. By way of comparison, when diaphragm cell liquor from the same cell was discharged in a continuous stream through a mild steel pipe directly to a reservoir at earth potential the pipe carrying the discharge was found to corrode rapidly, and to lose by corrosion approximately 2 cm of its length per month of operation.
