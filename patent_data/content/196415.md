## Description
The present invention relates to the use of trichostatin A and or trichostatin C for the manufacture of an antitumour drug. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel use of a compound of the formula wherein X is a hydrogen atom or a group of the formula as for the manufacture of an antitumour drug which inhibits proliferation of tumour cells in human or animal by inducing the differentiation of the tumour cells. Tumours are generally classified into solid tumours and liquid tumours hematopoietic organs . Treatments of tumours are generally by surgical, drug and radiation therapies. For the treatment of a solid tumour such as gastric cancer, surgical therapy or a combination of surgical therapy and radiation therapy has been traditionally employed as the first choice. Once metastasis is observed, drug therapy is used as a secondary or tertiary method of treatment. On the other hand, in the case of a liquid tumour such as leukemia, drug therapy is applied immediately after the positive diagnosis. Tumours are not a single type of diseases and show different sensitivities to various therapeutic methods. As mentioned above, however, the significance of drug therapy is extremely great in any type of tumours. Such drug therapy includes chemotherapy, immunotherapy and hormonotherapy. Among them, the most important therapy at present is chemotherapy which inhibits the metabolism of tumour cells by a direct action to tumour cells, or which inhibits proliferation of tumour cells by suppressing the DNA synthesis. At least some tumour cells are considered to be undifferentiated cells wherein the differentiation is interrupted for some reasons. Heretofore, some studies have been made to differentiate such tumour cells to convert the undifferentiated cells to functional cells i.e. terminal cells. In general, terminal cells do not proliferate, and therefore a drug which is capable of inducing the differentiation of tumour cells, can be an effective antitumour agent. For instance, there have been known some substances which are capable of inducing the differentiation of Friend leukemia cells as one type of experimental models. For instance, low molecular polar compounds such as dimethylsulfoxide DMSO and hexamethylenebisacetamide HMBA which are believed to act on the cell membranes of tumour cells to exhibit their effectiveness, have strong activities for inducing the differentiation. However, such activities are obtainable only at a high concentration of from some mM to some hundreds mM Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A., vol. 73, No. 3, p 862 866, 1976, published by the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America . Therefore, it is difficult to use them for practical applications. On the other hand, some carcinostatic antibiotic substances such as bleomycin and mitomycin C which are believed to act on DNA, have been reported to have activities for inducing the differentiation of tumour cells at low concentrations. However, such activities are generally weak Cancer Research, vol. 38, p 841 849, 1978, published by the Official Organ of the American Association for Cancer Research, Inc. . In the case of Friend leukemia cells, there is a general tendency although there are some variations depending upon the particular cell strains used that substances acting on the cell membranes require high concentration although their differentiation inducing activities are strong, and substances acting on DNA are weak in their activities although they show the activities at a low concentration. Under the circumstances, it has been strongly desired to develop an antitumour drug which has high carcinostatic activities and which has high selective toxicity against tumour cells. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide the manufacture of an antitumour drug which not only exhibits strong carcinostatic activities at a low concentration but also exhibits extremely high selective toxicity to cancer cells, i.e. an extremely strong and highly safe antitumour drug. The present invention is based on a discovery that the compounds of the above mentioned formula I have such excellent antitumour activities. The compounds of the formula I are known compounds. Namely, the compound wherein X is a hydrogen atom is trichostatin A the Journal of Antibiotics, vol. 29, No. 1, p 1 6, 1976, published by Japan Antibiotics Research Association , and the compound wherein X is the group of the formula II is trichostatin C the Journal of Antibiotics, vol. 31, No. 10, p 939 944, 1978 . Both compounds have been known to have antifungal activities, but their antitumour activities have not been known. Thus, the present invention provides use of trichostatin A and or trichostatin C for the manufacture of an antitumour drug. Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. The compounds of the present invention may be in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. As such pharmaceutically acceptable salts, any salts may be used so long as they do not adversely affect the desired pharmacological effects of the compounds. The selection and the production thereof can readily be made by those skilled in the art. For instance, as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, an alkali metal salt such as a sodium salt or a potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium salt or a magnesium salt, a salt with an organic base such as an ammonium salt, or a salt with an organic base such as a triethylamine salt or an ethanolamine salt, may be employed. The carcinostatic activities of the antitumour drugs of the present invention were determined by using Friend leukemia cells see Test Example 1 given hereinafter . Friend leukemia cells are cells which are commonly used as one of experimental cancer models for the researches on the inducement of the differentiation of tumour cells Annual Review of Biochemistry, vol. 47, p 419 448, 1978, published by Annual Review Inc., U.S.A. . They are tumour cells of a mouse, which proliferate with the differentiation of the proerythroblasts being suspended by the infection with Friend virus. These tumour cells are undifferentiated proerythroblast cells, and therefore do not produce hemoglobin. However, once they are differentiated to red blood cells, such cells produce hemoglobin. Therefore, the degree of differentiation can be evaluated on the basis of the hemoglobin production. Various substances have been known as substances for inducing the differentiation of tumour cells. For instance, the above mentionied dimethylsulfoxide DMSO and hexamethylenebisacetamide HMBA may be mentioned. The fact that the antitumour drugs of the present invention exhibit strong activities for inducing the differentiation of tumour cells at an extremely low concentration, was confirmed also with respect to erythroleukemia cells derived from a mouse e.g. Friend leukemia cells, formed by the infection with Rausher virus see Test Example 2 given hereinafter . As substances able to induce the differentiation according to this test, 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate TPA , dimethylsulfoxide DMSO of hexamethylenebis acetamide HMBA are known. The fact that the antitumour drugs of the present invention have extremely high selective toxicity against tumour cells, has been confirmed by comparing the activities against the tumour cells formed by the infection with tumour virus SV 40 and against the normal parent cells see Test Example 3 given hereinafter . The antitumour drugs of the present invention may be administered orally or non orally. In the case of oral administration, they may be administered in the form of soft and hard capsules, tablets, granules or powders. In the case of non oral administration, they may be administered in the form of injection solutions, drip infusion formulations, or formulations such as suppositories whereby continuous membrane absorption can be maintained in the form of solid or viscous liquid of suspension. The selection of the method for preparation of these formulations and the vehicles, disintegrators or suspending agents, can readily be made by those skilled in the art. The antitumour drugs of the present invention may contain a further substance having carcinostatic activities, in addition to the compounds of the formula I or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The amount of the active ingredients in the antitumour drug may vary depending upon the formulation, but is usually from 0.1 to 50 by weight irrespective of the manner of administration. The dose is determined taking into consideration the age, sex and symptom of disease of the patient, the desired therapeutic effect and the period of administration. However, a daily dose of the active ingredient is preferably from 0.05 to 100 mg for an adult. Now, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to Examples and Test Examples. 5 mg of trichostatin A as an active ingredient of the antitumour drug, was dissolved in a mixture comprising 1 g of purified sesame oil and 100 mg of aluminum stearate gel. The solution thus obtained was introduced in an amount of 0.5 ml each into capsules to obtain capsules for oral administration. Culture medium used 9.4 g of Eagle MEM No. 1 culture medium manufactured by Nissui Seiyaku K.K. , 0.3 g of L glutamine and 2 g of sodium bicarbonate were dissolved in 1 liter of distilled water, and then fetal calf serum manufactured by Armour Pharmaceutical Co. was added in an amount such that the final concentration would be 12 by volume. Into a cluster dish with 24 perforations made of Coster Co., U.S.A., 0.5 ml of the above culture medium, 1 x 10‚Åµ cells ml of Friend leukemia cells DS 19 strain obtained from the Institute of Applied Microbiology of Tokyo University and the test compound in a concentration as identified in Table 1, were introduced, and the cells were cultured in a 5 carbon dioxide gas incubator at 37 Hexamethylenebisacetamide HMBA which has been known to exhibit the strongest differentiation inducing activities against Friend leukemia cells DS 19 strain, was tested at the same time, whereby the differentiation inducing rate was 75 at a concentration of 4 mM. As calculated from the data shown in Table 1, the amount required to obtain the same differentiation inducing rate, is about 1 310,000 as calculated from 0.013 ¬µM in the case of trichostatin A, or about 1 6,200 as calculated from 0.65 ¬µM in the case of trichostatin C. Thus, the antitumour drugs of the present invention have remarkably superior activities for inducing the differentiation of tumour cells. Culture medium used 10.2 g of RPM I 1640 No. 2 culture medium manufactured by Nissui Seiyaku K.K. , 0.3 g of L glutamine and 2 g of sodium bicarbonate were dissolved in 1 liter of distilled water, and then fetal calf serum manufactured by Armour Pharmaceutical Co., U.S.A. was added in an amount such that the final concentration would be 12 by volume. In the same manner as in Test Example 1, the differentiation inducing rate against erythroleukemia cells RV 133 derived from a mouse obtained from Institute of Applied Microbiology of Tokyo University was measured. The above data indicate that the active ingredients of the antitumour drugs exhibit strong differentiation inducing activities at an extremely low concentration at a level of less than 1 mg ml also against erythroleukemia cells formed by the infection with Rausher virus, as in the case against Friend leukemia cells. Toxicity of the active ingredients of the antitumour drugs was compared as between against normal fibroblast cells taken from the kidney of a C3H He mouse C3H 2K obtained from the Institute of Medical Science of Tokyo University and against tumour cells formed by the infection of the same cells with tumour virus SV40 SV40 C3H 2K obtained from the same Institute . Culture medium used same as used in Test Example 1 From the above data, it is evident that the difference in the toxicity of the active ingredients of the antitumour drugs of the present invention against the normal cells and against the tumour cells is extremely large, and thus proves that the active ingredients have remarkably high selective toxicity against the tumour cells. As described in the foregoing, the present invention provides antitumour drugs which not only exhibit strong carcinostatic activities at an extremely low concentration but also have extremely high selective toxicity against tumour cells, i.e. extremely strong and highly safe antitumour agents.
