# Circuit board assembly.

## Abstract
Integrated circuit components are loaded in Indian file in carrier tube and retained in position by headed pin at each end of the tube. The invention provides a spring bale to locate the tube in position on a support pillar, along which the tubes are fed under gravity, the spring bale providing a cam track for automatic engagement with a pin head so as to displace the pin to a position in which the chips can feed as the tube is assem bled to the pillar without requiring any separate manipulative action.
