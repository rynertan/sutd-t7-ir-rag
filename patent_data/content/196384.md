# CALIBRATION STANDARD FOR FLYING HEIGHT TESTERS AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SAME

## Abstract
A calibration standard for calibrating flying height testers by simulating predetermined flying height characteristics of magnetic heads comprises a substrate 30 , a reflective layer 34 supported by a surface 32 of the substrate, and a transparent layer 36 disposed over the reflective layer. The transparent layer has an upper surface 38 arranged at an acute angle α to the reflective layer, the acute angle representing a predetermined flying angle of a magnetic head over a disk. An optical reference is carried by the transparent layer 36 on the upper surface a finite distance from the reflective layer 34 as measured perpendicular to the upper surface. This finite distance represents a predetermined flying height d of a magnetic head over a disk.

## Description
This invention relates to calibration standards for flying height testers and to methods of manufacturing the same. In particular the present invention relates to calibration standards for calibrating flying height testers used to test flying height characteristics of magnetic heads. It is common to use read write heads which fly over the surface of a rotating disk. Aerodynamic surfaces on the head react against the air moved with the rotating disk causing the head to fly a small distance from the disk surface. In the manufacture of such heads, it is common to test the aerodynamic characteristics of the head so that the flying height characteristics are known, thereby avoiding use of heads which fly too high or too low in relation to the disk surface or at an improper angle to the disk. Flying height testing is ordinarily accomplished by means of a flying height tester using optical inter ference techniques. Such a flying height tester comprises, for example, a monochromatic light source such as a tunable monochromator directing monochromatic light at a glass disk. The glass disk is rotated at speeds simulating the rotation of a magnetic disk, and a head arm assembly being tested is positioned in a holder or clamp in flying relation to the revolving glass disk. Mono chromatic light is directed at the disk at a predetermined angle to the surface thereof. Light is reflected from the surface of the disk closest to the flying head, and from the surface of the flying head itself, and impinges onto a sensor, such as a television camera or other light sensitive sensor. With the head in its flying position, monochromatic light reflected from the disk and from the head impinge upon the sensor in additive constructive interference and substractive destructive interference modes to create a pattern of bright and dark sectors, the sectors being bounded by fringes as they are known in the industry. The distance between the fringes is representative of the angle between the head and the disk and the position of the fringes relative to the image of the edge of the head is representative of the distance, or flying height, between the head and the disk. A computer, such as a Hewlett Packard HP 85 computer, programmed to receive data from the flying height tester, can calculate the perceived flying height and angle of the head using the detected fringe pattern distances. For further details concerning flying height testers using optical interference techniques, see Techniques for the Measurement of Air Bearing Separations A Review by C. Lin, IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, Vol. MAG 9, No. 4, pages 673 677 December 1973 . In the past, calibration of flying height testers has been accomplished through the use of a standard head whose characteristics are known. However, arm flight characteristics, gimble spring characteristics, etc., of the standard head change after repeated use and abuse. Further, dust, skin oil and other foreign matter may alter the flying characteristics and or reflective surface of the standard head, altering the calibration of the standard head. Because the flying orientation of a head is in part affected by the speed, radius, and stacking height of the magnetic disk, the actual field conditions of a head could not be duplicated, and it was necessary that heads be accepted that have characteristics within given acceptable ranges. Calibration of production heads could only be accomplished in relation to the calibration of the flying height tester by a given standard the standard could not be calibrated in absolute terms. It was not possible to calibrate heads on different flying height testers with any degree of accuracy. The present invention seeks to provide a calibration standard for flying height testers which permits calibration in absolute terms, rather than in relative terms so production heads can themselves be measured in absolute terms, and which is insensitive to disk velocity, tilt or contamination and which is easily used without significant modification to the test procedure or equipment and in particular so that it is not necessary to remove the tester glass disk during calibration. The present invention also seeks to improve the calibration technique for flying height tests so that a plurality of such testers may be standardised in relationship to each other. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a calibration standard for calibrating flying height testers by simulating predetermined flying characteristics of a magnetic head characterised by comprising a substrate a reflective layer supported by a surface of said substrate a transparent layer disposed over said reflective layer, said transparent layer having an upper surface arranged at an acute angle to said reflective layer, said acute angle representing a predetermined flying angle of a magnetic head over a disk and optical reference means carried by said transparent layer on said upper surface a finite distance from said reflective layer as measured perpendicular to the upper surface, said finite distance representing a predetermined flying height of a magnetic head over a disk. Said transparent layer preferably has a side normal to said upper surface and said optical reference means comprises an edge intersecting said side and said upper surface. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing a calibration standard for calibrating flying height testers character ised by comprising the steps of depositing a layer of reflective material onto a surface of a substrate deposit ing a layer of transparent material over said reflective layer grinding opposite, substantially parallel surfaces at a predetermined angle to said reflective layer, said angle representing a predetermined flying angle of a magnetic head and etching said transparent layer normal to the ground surface of said transparent layer to define a predetermined flying height by the minimum thickness of the transparent layer. The invention is illustrated, merely by way of example, in the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to the drawings, and in particular to Figure 1, there is illustrated a magnetic head and a disk of a flying height tester, as is used in testing production heads for flying height characteristics and also is used in calibrating such testers in accordance with the prior art. As shown in Figure 1, a transparent disk 10, such as a glass disk, is rotated about its axis not shown so that a magnetic head 12 flies a short distance from a surface 14 of the disk 10 due to air flowing in the direction of arrow 11 caused by rotation of the disk 10. Monochromatic light from a source, such as a tunable monochromator not shown , is directed along a path through the disk 10 to reflect off the surface 14 of the disk and a surface 16 of the head 12 to be reflected onto a sensor not shown . Specifically, monochromatic light impinges on the disk 10 at an incident angle ϑ to a surface 18 and follows a path 2 The path 20 In the past, flying height testers were calibrated using a standard head whose flying height characteristics were known to be adequate. However, the absolute character istics of the standard head were not known. Production heads were tested with the calibrated flying height tester, but production heads could only be tested in relation to the standard established by the standard head, not in absolute terms. Repeated use of the standard head often altered its characteristics, thereby causing changes in the calibration of the flying height tester. Furthermore, it was not possible to calibrate relatively production heads tested by different flying height testers. The present invention concerns a method and apparatus for standardising the calibration of a flying height tester. As shown in Figure 2, a calibration standard 28 according to the present invention comprises a transparent substrate 30, such as of glass, having a surface 32 on which is partially deposited a reflective coating or layer 34, such as a thin layer of chrome. The layer 34 is deposited on the surface 32, and a glass layer 36 is deposited over the layer 34, the layer 36 having an upper surface 38 at an angle α to the surface 34, representative of a predetermined flying angle of a magnetic head. The layer 36 has a thickness established by the height of a surface 40 equal to a desired standard flying height. For example, the height of the surface 40 may be of the order of 0.25 microns, approximately equal to the dimension To calibrate a flying height tester using the calibration standard illustrated in Figure 2, the calibration standard 28 is positioned in the flying height tester. The disk is maintained a distance from the calibration standard 28 greater than the coherence 1ength of light so that it does not optically interfere with the fringe pattern on the sensor it is not necessary to remove the disk, nor to rotate it during calibration. Monochromatic light is directed at the standard 28 along a path 42. Particularly, light impinges on the surface 38 at an angle ϑ and follows a path 42 Due to the additive and subtractive nature of the reflected light following overlapping paths 42 Figures 3A to 3F illustrate a method of manufacture of the calibration standard 28 illustrated in Figure 2. The transparent substrate 30 has the layer 34 of chrome sputter deposited onto an upper surface thereof. The layer 34 is thereupon etched back to a rectangular configuration illustrated in Figure 3B, visually duplicating a head surface. The layer 36 of glass is deposited over the substrate 30 and the layer 34 as shown in Figure 3C. Although Figures 3A to 3C illustrate the calibration standard in its final angular configuration, it is under stood that the deposit of the layers 34,36 is accomplished in a more conventional orientation during manufacture. The substrate 30 and the layer 36 are thereafter lapped at their upper surface 38 at an angle α representative of the flying angle of a magnetic head a lower surface 44 thereafter being ground approximately parallel to the surface 38 and at the desired angle α to the surface of the layer 34. Thereafter, excess overcoat is etched away leaving the configuration illustrated in Figure 3E with the layer 36 deposited on the layer 34 with the layer 34 extending beyond the bounds of the layer 36. Etching the layer 36 ordinarily also etches the exposed portions of the substrate 30, as shown. After testing the calibration standard to be certain that the surface 38 is flat, the height of the surfaces 40,50 are measured such as with a stylus profilometer , and the angle α is precisely measured. Data reflecting the heights of the surfaces 40,50 and of the angle α are recorded such as by etching perceivable data onto a chrome layer deposited for that purpose or onto an appropriate location of the substrate 30 . Thereafter, excess of the layer 34 extending beyond the surfaces 40,50 is etched away, leaving the completed standard as shown in Figure 3F. The surface 38 of the layer 36 and the substrate 30 represents the plane of the disk, and the surface 40 represents the absolute height of the calibration standard 28. The height of the surface 40 is measured in absolute terms, so production heads can be calibrated with the calibration standard in absolute terms. With reference to Figure 1, it can be shown that the light reflected along the path 20 The present invention thus provides a calibration standard for calibrating flying height testers which is more reliable than past standards, is rugged in use, and provides accurate calibration in absolute terms. The calibration standard is easily used, with little change in calibration procedures, and provides an effective calibration standard for absolute calibration of flying height testers.
