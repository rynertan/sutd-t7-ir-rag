# Method and equipment for rapid, automatic chemical clinical analysis.

## Abstract
A detecting device is fitted so as to span a row of adjoining receptacles 5 which are set in a reciprocating continuous motion, so that each receptacle passes within the scanning field of the detecting device 18 . The latter sends the signals sequentially to a processor 31 for elab oration into point curves showing the courses of each reac tion through time. The row of receptacles 5 may be set in a reciprocating motion by a rack, a stepping motor, a cam type control or a coupling device, etc.
