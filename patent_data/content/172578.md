# HYDROCRACKING CATALYST OF IMPROVED ACTIVITY

## Abstract
A catalyst composition composed of a crystalline alumi nosilicate Y zeolite, normally having a silica to alumina mole ratio of about 6.2 or above, in combination with a porous, inorganic refractory oxide. The Y zeolite contains ion exchanged rare earth cations and ion exchanged Group VIII noble metal cations. The combination of the zeolite and the refractory oxide contains between 4.5 weight percent and about 6.0 weight percent water. Such a catalyst containing the recited amount of water has been found to have consistently high activities when used as a catalyst in a hydrocracking process. The zeolites used as part of the catalyst are typically prepared by contacting an ammonium exchanged Y zeolite with an aqueous solution of ammonium fluorosilicate.
