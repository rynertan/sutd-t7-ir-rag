# Solution heat treated engine poppet valves.

## Abstract
A new solution heat treated engine poppet valve has been developed which has a microstructure characterized by a large grain size in the head 2 for optimum high temperature creep and fatigue properties and a finer grain size in the stem 3 for good low temperature strength and fatigue properties.
