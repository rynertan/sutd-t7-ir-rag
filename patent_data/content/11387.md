# Glow discharge heating devices.

## Abstract
Dimensional stability of a glow discharge heating device having electrodes for focussing the electron discharge cur rent is improved, according to the present invention, by pro viding one or more heat pipes 22 for transferring heat from electrode 11 to cooling fins 23 outside the vacuum chamber. In the embodiment illustrated, a second electrode 13 is water cooled. The improved cooling not only permits of use of a struc ture which takes a short time to reach thermally stable condi tions due to the small heat capacity of the solid material but also permits of different parts of the gun assembly being operated at different temperatures.
