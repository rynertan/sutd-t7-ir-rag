# Polymeric thin film and products containing the same.

## Abstract
A novel polymeric thin film having a high density, high hardness and high toughness is prepared on the surface of a substrate by plasma polymerization. The gas used to provide the plasma contains a halogenated alkane and or an alkane and optionally hydrogen and or a halogen, the atomic ratio of halogen hydrogen in the gas being from 0.1 1 to 5 1 and the electron temperature of the plasma in the reaction zone being 6,000K or higher and lower than 30,000K. The polymer ic thin film obtained is useful on various articles for the purpose of protection, surface hardening, rust proofing, scratch proofing, providing a gas barrier, etc. In particular, it is suitable as the protective film for magnetic recording media.
