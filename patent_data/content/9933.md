# Aromatic amide plasticizer for ionic polymers.

## Abstract
Metal or ammonium neutralized sulphonated elas tomeric polymer having 10 to 60 sulfonate meq. groups per 100 grams of the neutralized sulphonated elastomeric polymer are plasticised with 8 to 75 parts by weight per 100 parts of said neutralized sulphonated elastomeric polymer of an aromatic organic amide having the formula
