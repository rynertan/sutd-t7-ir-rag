# Heat resistant toughened adhesive composition.

## Abstract
A structurally toughened heat resistant adhesive composition comprising a solution of a polyacrylic elastomer in polymerizable acrylate ester monomers. The adhesive composition also contains an adhesion promoter, a cross linking agent, a free radical generator and a free radical accelerator. The adhesive compositions are generally used as two part systems, and yield bonds with improved heat and solvent resistant properties. The polymerizable acrylate ester monomers may be monofunctional or a combination of mono and polyfunctional monomers. Among the useful classes of monomers are alkyl and cycloalkyl acrylates, alkyl and cycloalkyl methacrylates, alkoxy acrylates and methacrylates, alkylene diacrylates and dimethacrylates. A few of the preferred monomers are methyl methacrylates, lauryl methacrylates, isobornyl methacrylates, and tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylates. The preferred acrylic rubbers are generally the homopolymers of alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid homopolymers of alkoxy esters of acrylic or methacryllic acid or copolymers of either of these with a lower alkene. Most preferred are the rubbers formed from the copolymerization of ethyl acrylate with 2 chlorethyl vinyl either, or from the copolymerization of ethylene, methyl acrylate and a third monomer containing carboxylic curing cites.
