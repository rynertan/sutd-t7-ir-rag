## Description
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION a Field of the Invention This invention relates to an electrophoresis system for multiple agarose slab gels in series and to a method for the separation of components from a mixture of molecules of mixed molecular weights, in particular for the separation of multiple DNA samples. b Description of Prior Art The high sensitivity and resolving power of agarose gel electrophoresis combined with the simplicity of known methods for the preparation of bacterial plasmids provide an efficient means in recombinant DNA research for the isolation of specific genes and for the creation of gene libraries from different organisms. Plasmids carrying desired DNA fragments can effectively be identified even in the absence of suitable genetic markers or specific hybridization probes, on the basis of a close relationship between the size of the intact molecules and their electrophoretic mobility in agarose. This convenient procedure is, however, seldom used in large cloning experiments mainly because of the limited capacity of most of the custom made or commercially available electrophoresis systems.A researcher with two electrophoresis apparatuses and a single generally expensive power supply may take several days or weeks only to find a unique recombinant plasmid among many hundreds that will complete its collection. The main problem which faces the researcher as well as the industry is therefore the lack of an apparatus which could be used to carry out simultaneously a large number of tests with agarose slab gels of various sizes. Most of the commercially available apparatuses are expensive and since at the most only two commercially available electrophoresis systems can be used simultaneously with the same power supply unit, an operation which involves a large number of tests, i.e. many agarose slab gels, necessarily means an investment which is generally unacceptable. This is especially true, because power supply units and platinum electrodes which are normally used with this type of apparatus are very expensive. For example, let us suppose that it is intended to provide a system which is capable of achieving the simultaneous testing of twelve 12 gels. In such a case, there would be needed twelve 12 such commercial apparatuses which are each designed to operate with one single slab gel, and six 6 power supply units, since each unit is capable of being connected to two electrophoresis apparatuses. There is therefore a need for a system which can include a large number of agarose slab gels and in which the investment outlay is as small as possible1 while at the same time providing an arrangement which is easy to operate and reliable. A rough evaluation of such a system would indicate that each apparatus including two platinum electrodes at today s cost would amount to about 500 600. In addition each power unit costs about 3000. Therefore, to provide a system which is operational with twelve 12 slab gels, the total cost would run to approximately 10,000. In addition, it will easily be realised that a system including the above parts would be too cumbersome to be interesting. A review of the prior art indicates that electrophoresis systems are well known. In this connection, the following U.S. Patents should be noted 3,578,604 May 11, 1971 Uriel 4,059,501 November 22, 1977 Strickler 4,151,065 April 24, 1979 Kaplan 4,198,389 April 15, 1980 Wadsworth 4,391,688 July 15, 1983 Hamelin 4,416,761 November 22, 1983 Brown et al In an effort to provide a system which is more operational and adequate than one which results from a combination of a plurality of prior art apparatuses associated with a plurality of power supply units, I have designed a low cost agarose slab gel electrophoresis apparatus which allows the separation of multiple DNA samples on four different gel slabs using a single outlet of a power supply unit. In U.S.Patent No. 4,391,688,I proposed slab superposition as a solution to unpleasant shortages of electrophoresis units and or power supplies which needlessly prevent or delay the completion of other experiments in the laboratory. In normal operation, it can be used to test at least four 4 slab gels of variable sizes while being connected to one single power supply unit. Of course, since there are two outlets for each power supply unit, a second apparatus of the same type can be connected to the same power supply unit. The apparatus of my U.S. Patent 4,391,688 can therefore provide an increase of the number of gels over the commercial apparatuses, while ensuring an analysis which is easy and rapid and with large resolution. In addition, there is no risk of contamination of the large molecules of DNA with small RNA or DNA molecules as could be the case withKaplan U.S. 4,151,065 as will be discussed later. However, my apparatus has certain disadvantages. For example, because the operator has to pile the various slab gels to be tested, the handling of a plurality of slab gels at the same time is quite complicated.Also, because this system is based on the stacking of slab gels1 it is hardly possible to have more than two stacks of slab gels, the reason being that the handling is difficult and if three stacks would be considered this would be mostly impractical mainly because of the number of plies of wick that would be required. The system described in my U.S. 4,391,688 is therefore limited to two stacks of slab gels under normal operation. Therefore, at the most, when connecting two apparatuses to one power supply unit, the test would be limited to eight 8 slab gels. The system of Uriel, described in U.S. Patent No.3,578,604 on the other hand is designed to contain one single slab gel which may perhaps hold a plurality of samples. The system is not adapted to carry out the electrophoresis with different type gels. The Uriel apparatus is somewhat the equivalent of the first stack of my U.S.4,391,688, with the proviso that the two vessels holding the liquid would be set at a specific distance which could not vary. It would therefore be impossible to use it with slab gels of various sizes. On the other hand, the support which is used to hold the gel is very complex and the connection with the liquid is achieved with the gel per se.In any case, Uriel is mainly concerned with the preparation of a particular type of medium to effect the separation, said medium including acrylamide, which would of course prevent the separation of molecules of the type plasmid recombinant. U.S. 4,059,501 to Strickler disclosed a very sophisticated apparatus without any particular reason therefor. The fact that the slab gels are allowed to move longitudinally with respect to the apparatus prevents the carrying out of tests with many gels at the same time. At the most1 two 2 slab gels could be used simultaneously while it would be of high interest to test up to twenty 20 gels simultaneously. In addition, this apparatus would possibly create problems of electrical contact because of the spring means 46 and the fact that the slabs rise along the spring means 46. The Strickler device is therefore not adapted to test a plurality of slab gels at the same time. According to Kaplan U.S. 4,151,065, the apparatus described therein, which is of the well known commercial type, has two containers with two electrodes, the containers being maintained at a fixed distance with respect to one another. It can therefore be used only with one size of slab gels. The gel is connected to the buffer and consequently to the electrode by means of agarose. The latter should be used at high concentration in order that the wick be used repeatedly. It is well known the agarose is very expensive and that it deteriorates very rapidly. The use of such an apparatus is complicated by the fact that agarose bridges are involved. To overcome this problem to some extent the gel is immersed in the buffer. However, this creates a problem of electrical overcharge especially if the operation is fast. One must therefore use only one apparatus with each power supply unit. With respect to the number of gels, since the process using the Kaplan s apparatus is restricted to a gel of a given concentration per apparatus, the number of samples is limited and the process cannot operate simultaneously with gels of agarose of different concentrations. Kaplan has tried to overcome this disadvantage by using gels of large dimensions and by providing two series of wells. However, under these conditions of operation, the small molecules will mask the larger molecules and prevent any interpretation. U.S. 4,198,389 Wadsworth relates to the field of immunology. In addition he is strictly concerned with wells, and not with the formation of straight lines in a gel. Even if modified to accommodate a plurality of gels, there is no suggestion that this could be done. Furthermore, there is only one sample per gel and there is no teaching that a plurality of apparatuses could be modified to operate in series. U.S. 4,416,761 Brown involves the use of a gel which does not enable a sufficient separation. There is one single well per sample. The apparatus is complicated and the gels have to be submerged with all the disadvantages mentioned above. In any case, this patent is less relevant than my own U.S. 4,391,688.SUMMARY OF INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a system whereby a plurality, for example at least twelve regular agarose slab gels with multiple slots can be run in series using only one power supply outlet.

The apparatus shown is made mostly of Plexiglas It comprises a plurality, such as twelve identical elongated box like containers 1, 2, ... 11 and 12. Each container is completely open at the top, as shown in the drawings and has rectangular cross section as particularly shown in FIGURES 2 and 3. In each case, the container is made of vertical partitions la, 2a, ... lla, 12a and lb, 2b, ... llb, 12b.As shown, the partitions la and lb, 2a and 2b, ... lla and llb, 12a and 12b are respectively connected together by means of bottoms lc, 2c, ... llc, 12c, and end portions ld and le, 2d and 2e, ... lld and lle, 12d and 12e. All the parts just described may all be made of Plexiglas, although they may be manufactured from other suitable materials such as Teflon commat . To complete the assembly of the plurality of containers 1, 2, ... 11 and 12, removable vertical plates 13 and 14 are disposed vertically, lengthwise with respect to each container 1 and 12, all as shown in FIGURES 1 and 2.Each vertical plate 13 or14 defines an electrode support and is provided with one electrical outlet 15 or 16, each outlet being adapted for connection to a suitable single power supply not shown of a type which is well known to those skilled in the art. Each vertical plate 13 or 14 has a platinum wire 17 or 19 which runs from the outlet 15 or 16, along the vertical plate 13 or 14 into the running buffer 21 or 23 which is present in containers 1 or 12. This arrangement of each vertical plate 13 or 14 will effectively define an electrode which is associated with a respective container 1 or 12. The vertical plates are in practice made of Plexiglas commat , however Teflons or any other suitable material may also be used. Plexiglas is a trademark for methyl acrylate plastic while Teflon is a trademark for polytetrafluoroethylene.The other containers 2 ... 11 also contain the same type of running buffer 22 ... 24. In order to make sure that the vertical plates 13 and 14 remain in vertical position, in each container there are provided a pair of blocks 25 and 27 which are fixed respectively against the inner vertical partition lb and 12a.This is illustrated in FIGURE 1 of the drawings. Each container 1 and 12 is also provided with a third block 29 which is fixed against a respective outer vertical partition la or 12b. As illustrated in the drawings, it will be seen that the blocks 25, 27 and 29 are arranged inside a respective container 1, 12 so that the inner side of a vertical plate defining an electrode support 13 or 14 rests against the pair of blocks 25, 27. On the other hand, the outer side of an electrode support 13 or 14 rests against the third block 29.This arrangement enables each electrode support 13 and 14 to remain in vertical position. As shown, in the drawings, all the containers 1, 2, ... 11 and 12 are set substantially parallel to one another and are disposed in such a manner on a surface that the distance between two containers can be adjusted to vary according to needs. The device illustrated comprises a pair of agarose gel slabs containing horizontal plates 31 and 33 to cover all the gaps between the containers 1, 2, ... 11, 12. As shown1 the horizontal plates are arranged in bridging fashion over two consecutive elongated box like containers 1, 2, ... 11, 12. In arranging the plates 31, 33 over the containers 1, 2, ... 11, 12 care should be taken to make sure that their edges are parallel respectively with the inner partitions lb, 2a 2b, ... lla llb, 12a of the containers 3 and 5. In the embodiment which is illustrated, as it will be seen later, the outer edges of the plates 31, 33 extend slightly past the partitions lb, 2a 2b, ... lla llb, 12a for a more practical operation of the device according to the invention.Although only two plates have been shown to bridge consecutive containers, it is obvious that more plates can be disposed over the containers depending on the sizes of the plates and of the containers and the need to carry out a large number of tests at the same time. As mentioned previously, the gel 35 which is formed on the plates 31, 33 has a row of wells 37 which have been prepared by placing a well forming comb not shown over each plate 31, 33 at a distance of about 2 mm from the surface thereof, near the edges of the plates 31, 33 closest to the container 12. Once the plates 31, 33 have been placed over the containers 1, 2, ... 11, 12 in the manner shown in FIGURE 1 of the drawings a sheet of a two ply Nu GauzeX wick 39 is arranged to have one edge portion 41 covering the gel 35 all in the manner illustrated in the drawings. The other edge portion 45 is allowed to hang down as shown in the drawings so as to dip into the running buffer 23 which has been added to all the containers before initiating the test. Of course there are used two sheets 39 for each gel. The operation of the device is as indicated previously with reference to the description of the method.EXAMPLE The invention is also illustrated by means of the following example.Preparation of virus DNA Human cytomegalovirus HCMV strain AD169 obtained from Dr F. Rapp, Pennsylvania State University, Hershey was propagated in human IAFP 1 lung fibroblasts, and virus harvested from the extracellular fluids by polyethylene glycol precipitation. Virus particles were purified by velocity sedimentation through 10 50Yó sucrose gradients. DNA was isolated from purified virions by lysis with 1 SDS and 150 jug ml proteinase K Sigma followed by isopycnic centrifugation in CsCl ethidium bromide. Construction, transfection and isolation of recombinant plasmids The plasmid pAT153 which contains ampicillin and tetracycline resistance markers was extracted from Escherichia coli strain HB101 and purified by equilibrium CsCl ethidium bromide centrifugation as described by Spector et al. J.Virol. 1982, 42, 558 552 . Plasmid and HCMV DNAs were cleaved separately with 5 10 units of the restriction endonucleaseHind III Boehringer Mannheim Canada in 20 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4, 7 mM MgC12, and 60 mM NaCI at 370C for 2 h followed by inactivation of the enzyme at 70 C for 10 min. Viral HindIII restriction fragments were mixed with the linearized plasmid in a 4 1 molar ratio of free ends. The DNA concentration was adjusted to 20 rg ml and the mixture then incubated with 1 2 units of T4 DNA ligase BMC in 20 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgC12 10 mM DTT, 0.6 mM ATP at 40C for 16 h.Transfection of the ligated plasmids into E. coli was done by the CaC12 method of Hutchison and Halvorson disclosed in Gene 1980, 8, 267 278. Colonies of HB101 containing recombinantHCMV plasmids were picked directly from selection agar plates containing 50 pg ml ampicillin and 4 pg ml tetracycline into 1.5 ml of nutrient broth with ampicillin only and grown overnight at 370C. Bacterial pellets were prepared by centrifugation of the culture at 12,800 g for 1 min in an Eppendorf microfuge. Each pellet was suspended in 20 Sul of a solution containing 25 sucrose, 50 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.5, 100 mM EDTA, 0.1 Triton X 100, and 1 mg ml lysozyme. After 10 min at room temperature, the mixture was placed in boiling water for 40 sec, then centrifuged at room temperature for 15 min.The supernatant was removed without touching the gelatinous material at the bottom of the tube and kept at 700C for later plasmid analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis.Identification of recombinant plasmids by agarose gel electrophoresis A 10 P1 aliquot from each of the cleared lysates was loaded onto a 1 agarose slab gel 14 x 18 x 0.5 cm prepared in 100 ml of TBE buffer 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.3, 0.1 M boric acid, 2 mM EDTA . Agarose gels were carefully aligned two by two on the inner side of facing buffer chambers and DR covered at both ends with two ply Nu Gauzei Johnson and Johnson, Inc. wicks. Electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V for every pair of gels 900 V total for 4 h at room temperature. After the run, the twelve gels used were stained with 1 pg ml ethidium bromide and photographed under ultraviolet light illumination. Supercoiled plasmids of known molecular weight were included in each run as markers.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A total of 216 DNA samples were loaded on twelve different agarose slab gels resting on the inner side of seven buffer vessels and electrophoresed together at 900 V for 4 h using a single power supply. Sharp DNA bands were obtained in each case and the distance travelled by the recombinant plasmids of known size appeared as relatively constant from one gel to another FIGURE 2 . A close relationship between migration rate and size was also observed for each of the DNA markers. With the electrophoresis system according to the present invention, hundreds of DNA samples may thus be conveniently analyzed in one day using a minimum of expensive equipment. Results also confirm the versatility of the basic electrophoresis unit according to the invention. The DNA band found in the lowest part of the gels in FIGURE 2 lane 10 contains pAT153 without any insert. All the otherDNA molecules in the gels migrate less rapidly than the in tact cloning vector and thus contain at least one Hind III fragment of HCMV DNA. Such results indicate that both the insertion of foreign DNA at the Hind III site of pAT153 and the selection of recombinant E. coli clones were done in optimal conditions. The approx. size of each of the 192 recombinant plasmids was determined using fully characterized plasmids asDNA markers. As shown in FIGURE 3, plasmids carrying Hind III fragments appeared as well distributed in size between 4 and 10 Kb. Larger plasmids up to 42 Kb were less freque ntly observed than smaller ones. This may be related to the fact that transformation efficiency declines linearly with increasing plasmid size. Restriction endonuclease cleavage site analysis later showed that more than 70 of the HCMV genome was represented in the whole series of recombinants. Such results confirm the usefulness of the electrophoresis system according to the invention, in large cloning work. Agarose gel electrophoresis provides a simple, convenient and inexpensive way to analyse DNA molecules.Physical mapping of DNA genomes closely rely on such gels.It remains, however, that small DNA fragments below 0.3 Kb are sometimes difficult to detect in gel systems commonly used. When such fragments are missed during the construction of a physical map, it is then impossible to guarantee the exact position of all the restriction endonuclease sites on the DNA molecule. In this study, forty two recombinant plasmids only slightly larger than pAT153 were detected by screening the DNA molecules in their superhelical form FIGURE 2 . Frequently observed and always distributed among limited number of size groups FIGURE 4 , these plasmids most probably carry small Hind III fragments of the HCMV genome.The electrophoresis system according to the present invention is currently used not only to screen recombinant clones, but also to establish the restriction maps of different viral genomes or follow the activity of DNA modifying enzymes in column effluent fractions during purification. This unique system provides equivalent migration rates in more than twenty large scale gels to compare relative DNA band mobilities in numerous samples, and the results are definitively equivalent to those obtained by other systems which are more expensive to fabricate or purchase. Because of its high sample capacity and simplicity, less costly equipment is required per experiment. Versatility is another advantage of the system i large or small slabs can be run in series and ii simultaneous migration of DNA molecules in low and highconcentration gels is also possible. No particular problem has been encountered while running gels in series even if the technique requires the use of high buffer holding capacity wicks to provide uniform electrical paths between the electrodes and the gel slabs. The electrophoresis system thus according to the invention appears as a most effective and useful tool for DNA separation in agarose gels.
