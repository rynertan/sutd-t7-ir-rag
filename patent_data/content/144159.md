# Improvements in or relating to high gradient magnetic filters.

## Abstract
A high gradient magnetic filter is enhanced by the electrophoretic effect whereby the range of effectiveness of the conventional high gradient magnetic filter for collecting suspended magnetic solid particles from liquid streams, such as power plant coolant streams, is extended to collect suspended magnetic solid particles of submicron size as well as particulates not susceptible to a magnetic field gradient. A conventional high gradient magnetic filter is connected into a pipeline, through which a liquid stream containing the suspended solid particles to be removed is flowing, so that the filter is electrically insulated from the remainder of the pipeline, and a potential is applied to the filter to polarize same relative to the pipeline with a polarity which is opposite the polarity of the charged particles in the stream which are to be collected.
