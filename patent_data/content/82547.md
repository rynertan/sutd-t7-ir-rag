# Suspension system for coupled axles of industrial vehicles.

## Abstract
Suspension system for coupled axles of industrial vehicles, comprising, for each side of the vehicle, two rigid arms 8, 10 rotatably coupled to a central pivot 12 on the frame 9 of the vehicle and connected at their ends to the axles 2, 4 and an elastic means 22 secured to elements 28, 28 in the form of brackets which project from and are integrally formed with said arms and have the function of springing and dampening the vibrations. For each side of the vehicle one arm 10 has a geometrical configuration adapted to react to lateral thrust and the other 8 has the form of a rod articulated at its ends with ball joints 30, 32, 36 to afford a good degree of freedom in the coupling and impart to the system the capability of articulation and follow the unevennesses of the ground.
