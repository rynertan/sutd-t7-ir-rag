# PILE INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL MECHANISMS IN OFF SHORE RIGS AND METHOD OF USING SAME

## Abstract
A temporary rig of the jack up type for oil and gas exploration. The rig is towed to a selected site where the legs are lowered to the ocean floor and the deck is raised out of the water. Piles are then pushed into the ocean floor by a series of extensions of hydraulic jacks to anchor the legs. The piles can be pulled up by contracting the jacks in a similar manner so that the rig can be moved to a new location. The jacking mechanisms move within pile guides that form parts of the legs.
