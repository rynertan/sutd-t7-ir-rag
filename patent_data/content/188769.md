## Description
DYNAMIC TYPE SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a dynamic type semiconductor memory device in which a word line to be refreshed is selected by a shift register and when a power source is switched ON, only one bit of the shift register is used to select the output for selecting the word line. 2. Description of the Related Arts A dynamic type random access memory RAM requires periodical refreshing to prevent the disappearance of cell information. During this refreshing, all word lines of the memory are sequentially selected one by one, and all memory cells belonging to the selected word line are refreshed. That is, this refreshing is carried out by a method in which stored cell charges correspond to data 0 and N1N are returned to a correct value when data is written. For selecting the word line to be refreshed, conventionally, an address counter is used. Namely, an address counter counts clocks and generates an address which sequentially selects the word lines, and this address is input to usual access system for the word line.However, this has a drawback in that the operation becomes very complicated. For removing the drawback mentioned above, a device which provides a shift register having an input and output which is used exclusively for refreshing by sequentially selecting the word lines, has been proposed by the same applicant in United State Patent ApplicationSerial No. 648,506. The shift register has an input and an output connected to each other and operates in like a manner as a ring counter. In the device mentioned above, the refresh operation can be performed without applying any refresh address information to the device from the exterior as in the device including a refresh address counter. In addition, as the shift register has a simple circuit configuration as compared to the ordinary refresh address counter, it has an advantage in that each stage of the shift register can be laid out between word lines having a narrow pitch when formed as an integrated circuit. However, when more than two bits of the data held in the shift register are at 1 , the word lines are multi selected and the cell information is destroyed.Further, when the bits are all 0 , the word line is not selected and refreshing is not carried out normally.Despite such potential malfunctions, each stage of the shift register is in an unstable state when the power source is switched ON, and a plurality of bits may become 1 or all of the bits may become 0 . These data are maintained as long as the power source is kept in ON state, and thus, the malfunctions explained above may occur. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a dynamic type semiconductor memory device having a shift register in which only one bit becomes 1 selection level . In a dynamic type semiconductor memory device, a shift register holds data including only one bit at 1 and the remainder of the bits are at nOn. The data is circulated and sequentially selects only one word line at a time by a 1 output of the data to refresh the memory device. A set up circuit, when an output of a specified stage of the shift register is 1 , makes all outputs of remaining stages 0 , and when all outputs of all stages of the shift register are 0 , makes an output of a specified stage of the register 1 . According to the present invention, only one bit of the stages of the shift register is set at 1 and all the remaining stages are set at nO at least after one complete cycle of the data shift all around the stages even if plural stages have been set at 1 due to instability of the device immediately after the powerON. The one complete cycle of the data shift may be conducted as a warming up operation after power ON, and thus, the malfunction in which the outputs of all stages are nO , none of the word lines are selected or refreshing, or plural word lines are selected at a time, can be prevented. Further features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the ensuing description with reference to the accompanying drawings to which, however, the scope of the invention is in no way limited. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a diagram showing the outline of one example of a conventional dynamic RAM Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram of a shift register shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a diagram showing an outline of one embodiment of the RAM according to the present invention Fig. 4 is a diagram explaining the principle of the operation of the present application and Fig. 5 is a diagram showing one embodiment of a set up circuit according to the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Figure 1 is a diagram showing an outline of one example of a dynamic RAM according to the prior art. The dynmic RAM shown in Fig. 1 includes a word line driver portion 1 used exclusively for a refresh operation, and a shift register portion 2 which sequentially indicates the word lines which are selected in the driver portion 1, reference numeral 3 designates a memory cell array in which dynamic type memory cellsMC only one example is shown in the drawing and is a one transistor one capacitor type are connected at cross points between a plurality of word lines WL and a plurality of bit lines BL, reference numeral 4 designates another word line driver portion usually used for access, and reference numeral 5 designates a NOR gate portion which decodes external addresses A, for usual addresses via the address buffer and which makes the driver portion 4 select one word line WL. The operation timings of the two driver portions 1 and 4 are controlled by exclusive signals WDR, WDA, so that the two driving portions are not operated at the same time. A shift register portion 2 has the same number of stages as that of the word lines WL, wherein only one stage holds data 1 and the remaining stages hold data nOn. This data is circulated and the data 1 sequentially selects the word lines. Namely, the output of data 1 sequentially brings the word lines to a selection level via the driving portion 1. Figure 2 shows a concrete example of this shift register portion, wherein 21, 22, 23, ... represent shift registers of each of the stages.The shift registers 21, 22, 23, of each stage are formed by three transistors Qil X Qi3 and one capacitor Cil i 1, 2, 3, ... and are operated by receiving two clocks o 01 The clocks jo 01 are of opposite polarities, that is, when one clock is at the H power source VCC level, the other is at the L power source Vss 2Vth level. Hereinafter an explanation is given of the operation of the shift register stage 22. When the output N12 of the former stage 21 is at the H level, if the clock rises to Vcc , the transistor Q21 is turned ON, so that the node N21 is brought to the H high level.Thereafter, when the clock 00 decreases to V55 2Vth Vth is a threshold voltage of each transistor , the transistor Q21 turns OFF, the node N21 holds the H level, and as the clock 1 rises to VCC , the transistor Q22 turns ON, so that the node N22 is brought to the H level and the capacitor C21 is charged up. When the voltage of the capacitor C21 becomes higher than Vth , the transistor Q turns ON. When the transistor Q23 turns ON, charges in the capacitor C11 in the former stage are discharged, so that the level of the node N12 is lowered.When the level of this node N12 decreases and reaches Vss Vth , as the level of clock 0 is Vss 2Vth , the transistor turns ON again, so that charges in the node N21 are discharged via the transistor 423. As a result, the transistor Q22 turns OFF, the node N22 is brought to the H level and the node N12 is brought to the L level, and thus one shift operation is completed. That is, the capacitor C11 of the former stage is discharged so that the data becomes 0, and at the same time, the capacitor C21 of the own stage is charged so that the data becomes 1 n . Accordingly, the data 1 is shifted by only one stage of the register. This operation is repeated and the data 1 is sequentially shifted at each stage, so that the word lines are selected sequentially one by one.Furthermore, the output stage of the shift register is coupled to the input stage so that the data shift can be cyclically repeated. In the latter half of the shift cycle mentioned above O V55 2Vth t i1 Vcc I the node N22 is brought to the H level, but this is not written in the shift register 23 of the following stage. That is, at this time, as the clock 00 is at the L level, the transistor Q31 is OFF, the node N31 is at the L level, and therefore, the transistor Q32 is OFF, thus the capacitor C31 is not charged. However, this operation is based on the premise that the output N22 of the shift register 22 in a former cycle is O . Each stage of the above mentioned shift register portion 2 has a simple circuit configuration, therefore, it has an advantage in that it can be laid out between word lines having a narrow pitch when it is formed as an integrated circuit. However, when more than two bits of the data held in the shift register are at flu , the word lines are multi selected and the cell information is destroyed. Further, when the bits are all O , the word line is not selected and refreshing is not carried out usually, each stage of the shift register is in an unstable state when the power source is switched ON, and a plurality of bits may become 1 or all of the bits may become O . Figure 3 is a block diagram showing an outline of the present invention, in which a set up circuit 6 is added to the circuit shown in Fig. 1. Figure 4 is a detailed diagram showing an essential portion of the embodiment of Fig. 3 including this set up circuit 6.Namely, Fig. 4 shows a case wherein, as an example, the cell array 3 holds a total of 512 word lines from m0 to We511. The word line driver portion 1 and the shift register portion 2 are also formed in the 512 stage construction so as to correspond to the number of word lines. In Fig. 4, WD shows each stage of the word drivers and SR shows each stage of the shift registers.In Fig. 4, when the specified stage of the set up circuit 6, for example, an output of SR000 is 1 selection level , the SR000 output of 1 is used as a reset signal RST to reset the remaining stages fromSR1 to SR511 and the outputs thereat are made 0 nonselection level . When the outputs of all stages of the shift registers 2 are nO , the set up circuit 6 makes the output of the specified stage SR000 or another specified stage such as SR002 1 . The first function may be repeated every time the output of the specified stage SR becomes 1 , then this function may be added. The second function, whereby the outputs of all stages of the shift registers become 0 , occurs only during a special state such as the switch ON time for the power source and does not occur in a steady state.Therefore, this function also may be added. Figure 5 shows one embodiment of the present invention which is applied to the shift register shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 5, the stages SR000 X SR corre spond to those shown in Fig. 4 and the construction thereof is the same as the stages 21 to 23 shown inFig. 2. The outputs of the stages SR000 to SR51l are connected to the word drivers WD000 to WD511 as shown in Fig. 4. The output N5112 of the last stageSR511 is fed back to the input of the initial SR000 to form a ring counter. The set up circuit 6 is formed by a reset portion 61 and a selection level generating portion 62. As shown in Fig. 5, in the reset portion 61, transistors Q0014 , 40024 ... Q5104 Q5114 are connected between the outputs N0012 N0022 ... N5102 N5112 and the ground. The output N0002 of the special stage SR000 is connected to the gates of the transistors Q0014 Q5114. Therefore, when the output N0002 of the stage SR000 turns ON, the transistors Q00l4 , ..., 114 also turn ON, so that the outputs N0012N0022 r ..., N5102 t N5112 except N0002 are made 0 . Concretely, this means that the charges of the capacitorsC11 , C21 , ... shown in Fig. 2 are forcibly pulled out by the transistors Q0014 t Q5114 In the selection level generating portion 62, the gatesof transistor Qool5 , ..., Q5105 , Q5115 are connected the outputs N0012 N0022 ... N5102 N5112 the drains thereof being connected as a node N1 , and the sources connected to ground. The transistors Q0015 to Q5115 form a NOR gate and a depletion type transistor n is used as a load thereof. A depletion type transistor Q 2 and the transistor QA3 form an inverter, and the output of the NOR gate is connected to the gate of the transistor QA3. The transistors QA4 and QA5 form a push pull amplifier and the output of the inverter is connected to the gate of the transistorQA5 and the gate of the transistor QA4 receives the output of the NOR gate.The output of the push pull transistor is connected to the output N0002 of the specified stage SR000 The selection level generator circuit 62 shown inFig. 5 prevents the output N0002 of the initial stage SRooo from becoming 0 when the outputs N0002 X N5112 of the shift register 2 are all 0 . That is, when the outputs N0012 X N5112 all become 0 , the transistors Q015 X Q635 of the NOR gate having the transistorQA1 as a load all become OFF, so that the output N1 is brought to a high level H.Transistors QA2 Qd form an inverter which inverts this output N1 , and the inverted output N2 and the gate output N1 drive output stage push pull transistors QA4 QA5. Therefore, when the output N1 of the NOR gate is brought to the H level, the output GEN of the selection level generator circuit 62 is also brought to the H level, so that the output N0002 of the initial stage SRooo is forcibly made 1 . Concretely, this means that a forcible charge up is carried out via a capacitor for example, C11 and a transistor QA4 shown in Fig. 2.At this time, as the transistor a0014 N Q5114 turns ON, then the outputs of all stages except for the initial stage are made non Although the output N0002 of the initial stage SRooo does not always become 1 when the power source is switched ON, however, the shift operation is commenced when the power source is raised. Accordingly, the output of any stage becomes 1 , and the output N0002 of the initial stage eventually becomes 1 , so that the circuit 61 is operated. Up to this point, the outputs of the plurality of stages may be 1 , however, as the data is not written in the RAM at this time, no problem arises. In the above mentioned explanation, the initial stage SR000 is taken as the specified stage. However, the specified stage is not limited to the initial stage, i.e., the speciffied stage for the reset circuit 61 may be different from that for the selection level generator circuit 62. As explained above, according to the present invention, the operation is automatically set up in such a manner that only one bit of the content of the shift register for refreshing is brought to the selection level. Accordingly, destruction of the data due to the multi selection of the word lines at the following refreshing operation can be prevented, and also the problem in which refreshing is not carried out because the word line is not selected when the data held in the shift register is all 0 does not arise.
