## Description
Signal Processing Apparatus for Image Scanners This invention relates to image scanners ani, in particular1 to signal processing apparatus for use therewith In mechanical optical image scanners, a detector array of one or more detector elements, usually photoconductive detectors, is scanned by an image of a scene to be viewed and produces an electrical signal which is processed and fed to a display device to enable the image to be viewed. Generally, the signal processing equipment includes sampling means for sampling the signal at a sampling frequency higher than the frequency range of interest, means for amplifying, shaping, storing and otherwise further processing the sampled signal as required, and means for reconstituting the further processed signal ready for supply to the display device. The characteristics of the detectors, and likewise the signal processing techniques employed, tend to cause roll off at the higher frequencies,Although noise generated by the detectors and preamplifiers also tends to roll off, this noise roll off is not as fast as the fall off in signal response. In addition, noise present in the signal being sampled at a frequency above one half the sampling frequency tends to beat down with the sampling frequency to noise of a lower frequency in the range of interest, thereby worsening the signal to noise ratio, On the other hand, at frequencies below half the sampling frequency, there is a clear benefit to be obtained by boosting higher frequencies within the range of interest, since these Arequencies determine the sharpness and detail of the viewed image. It would therefore be advantageous to provide signal processing equipment which can boost higher frequencies in the range of interest while excluding noise of a frequency above one half the sampling frequency. However, in providing such a boost to higher frequencies in the range of interest, it is necessary to take into account any disturbance of the relative phases of the components of the original signal, since the effect of phase shifts is to increase the noise level at a faster rate than the resolution of the image is improved. The present invention has for an object to provide a solution to this problem. Accordingly, the invention provides signal processing apparatus for an image scanner comprising one or more detector elements scanned by an image of a scene to be viewed and producing an electrical signal representative of said image, sampling means operative at a predetermined sampling frequency B for sampling said electrical signal. to enable further processing thereof, means for reconstituting the sampled and further processed signal and a display device for receiving the reconstituted signal to enable said image to be viewed, wherein a filter means is located in the or each detector channel ahead of the sampling means in order to shape the band response, and a phase correcting means is located after the signal reconstituting means, said phase correcting means being constructed substantially to correct phase errors introduced prior to sampling by said filter means.The phase correcting means is preferably an asymmetric transversal filter. Thus, in accordance with the invention, a filter means, which may be a conventional band shaping filter, is located the or each detector channel ahead of the sampling means, in order to provide a selective boost to frequencies in a range having an upper limit adjacentF 2 while rejecting frequencies above F 2, and a single phase correcting means such as a transversal filter is located in the path of the reconstituted signal to restore the original phase relationships of the components of the original signal, which have been disturbed by the band shaping action of the filter means. It is to be noted that it is not necessary to provide a phase correcting transversal filter for each detector channel. A practical arrangement of signal processing apparatus in accordance with the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a block diagram of a chain of signal processing apparatus and Figure 2 is a circuit diagram of an asymmetrical transversal filter. The apparatus shown in Figure 1 comprises an array 10 of detector elements signal processing equipment 11 constituted by a sampling means 12, further processing means 13 such as amplifying means, shaping means, signal storage means and in general means for effecting any such further process functions on the signal as may be required, and signal reconstituting means 14 and a display device 15. For convenience and clarity the detector array 10 and the display device 15 are considered part of the signal processing chain, although they do not actually perform any signal processing function in themselves. The sampling means 12, which is of a kind conventional in such processing equipment, operates at a predetermined sampling frequency F above the range of frequencies of interest. In order to shape the band response for providing a boost to higher frequencies in the range of interest below F 2, a conventional band shaping filter 17 is provided in each detector channel between the detector array 10 and the processing equipment 11. In the drawing, filter means 17 for the first and nth detector channels are indicated For restoring phase errors in the components of the original signal, due to phase shifts produced by the filter. means 17, a transversal filter 16 is located in the path of the reconstituted signal between the signal processing equipment 11 and the display device 15. The transversal filter 16 is asymmetrically constructed with a frequency response function of the general form R f a 1 cos 21T f t b2 sin 2 f c1 cos 4 f c2 sin 4 f ...., where a, b2, b3 .... are tapping ratio coefficients of the filter and T is the delay parameter of the filter stages. One simple example of such a filter is shown in Figure 2, which has a response of the form R f a b1 cos 21T f b2 sin 2 f d1 cos 6 d2 sin 6 f f . In Figure 2, 18 designates the input and 19 designates the output, A indicates a differential amplifier, delay stages are marked and resistors are designated R. It is to be noted that R2 Rs1 and R3 R31. The differences in the values between these pairs of resistors, which may be referred to as the tapping ratios of the filter, determine the magnitude of the coefficients b1, b2, and d1, d2. In a conventional matsched phase symmetric transversal filter, R2 R21 and R3 R31, so that b2 and d2 are equal to zero. However, in the asymmetric filter in accordance with the invention, the tapping ratios of the filter are selected to determine the coefficients in the response function so that the necessary correction of phase errors is achieved. Thus, referring again to the general case, the modulus of the frequency response of the transversal filter is given by R f a b1cos2 f c1cos ... Ãª b2sin2 f c2 sin 4Tr f .0.0 2 and the phase e is determined by the expression EMI7.1 tb SEP SEP b2 SEP sin SEP 2 SEP ff SEP f SEP l SEP SEP c2 SEP sin SEP 4tr SEP f SEP tb SEP SEP tan SEP a SEP SEP b1 SEP cos SEP 2 SEP X SEP ft SEP SEP c1 SEP cos SEP 4XR SEP f SEP tb It is possible to select the coefficients independently in such a manner that a wide range of distinct amplitude and phase characteristics are obtained. Usually, however, such a complex determination will not be necessary.If, for example, it is only phase correction that is required tR f l is made equal to unity at the frequencies of interest. More generally, however, some trimming of the amplitude response is desirable In this case, to give one example, if the amplitude is made unity at f f1 and at f f2, the corresponding phases being 1 and 2. then if an asymmetric transversal filter is constructed based on four delay stages each with a delay parameter , four independent tapping ratios are available corresponding to specific values for b1, b2, c1 and c2, with a 1. Then 1 b1cos2 f1 c1cos4 f1 tan b2sin2 f1 c2sin4 f1 and 1 b1cos2 f2 c1cos4 f2 tan 2 b2sin2 f2 c2sin4 f2 . These two equations can be solved for, say, bt and c1, in terms of b2 and c2, and then substituted in the equations 1 b1cos2 f1 c1cos4 f1 Ãª b2sin2 f1 c2sin4 f1 Ãª 1 and 1 b1cos2 f1 c1cos4 f2 Ãª b2sin2 f1 c2sin4 f2 Ãª 1 thereby to give a pair of quadratic equations in b2 and c2, which may be solved for 2 and c2 and thence also determine b1 and c1. Finally, it should be mentioned that the invention is applicable to the case of an image scanner wherein a single detector element is employed.
