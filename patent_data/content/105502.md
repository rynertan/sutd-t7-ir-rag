# Perpendicular magnetic recording method.

## Abstract
A perpendicular magnetic recording method for record ing two kinds of signals 22, 24 on a magnetic recording medium 10 which has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, recording the first kind of signal 22 on the recording medium 10 with a linear recording density higher than 30 kBPI, and then recording the second kind of signal 24 on that recording track 14, 16, 18 on which the first kind of signal 22 has been recorded, with a linear recording density which is 15 or more kBPI lower than that of the previously recorded signal, whereby two kinds of signals can be recorded on the same recording medium 10 in such a way that they are superimposed on one another. These two kinds of signals are detected at the same time by one magnetic head and frequency separated by a reproduced signals processing circuit which is provided with high and low pass filters.
