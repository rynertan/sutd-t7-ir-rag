# Process for catalytic reforming of naphtha using a rhenium containing catalyst.

## Abstract
A naphtha reforming process using a rhenium promoted platinum catalyst in which the catalyst is contacted, on initiation of the reforming reaction, with hydrogen at a rate not exceeding about 75 percent of the rate of hydrogen required for maintaining the optimum C₅ liquid yield over the length of the operating cycle. The hydrogen rate is increased not later than the time of line out of the C₅ liquid yield to that required to maintain said optimum C₅ liquid yield.
