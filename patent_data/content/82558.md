# Control signal generator arrangement for semiconductor switches.

## Abstract
Power delivered to a load 1 by a three phase supply R,Y,B is controlled by six thyristors RU, RL, YU, YL, BU, BL which are controlled by a control signal generator comprising a programmed microcomputer 2 , a zero crossover detector 3 , a clock pulse generator 6 and a counter 7 in such manner that the thyristor conduction angles are determined by a digital signal applied to an input 17 of the microcomputer. In order to obtain a fast response to changes in the supply frequency and to take into account any unbalance between the supply phases the microcomputer repeatedly measures the actual length of each nominally 60 portion of a complete period of the supply by starting the counter 7 at a predetermined point within each portion, the counter subsequently being stopped by the output of the detector 3 when the next zero crossover occurs and then being read by the microcomputer. The microcomputer keeps a running record of the six results most recently obtained and generates the control signals at a predetermined time determined by the signal at its input 17 prior to the instant at which each subsequent zero crossover is expected to occur on the basis of when a zero crossover has already occurred and the current content of the record.
