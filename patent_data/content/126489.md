# Poly V Pulley and manufacturing method therefor.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a poly V pulley includes a process for slitting and compressing the peripheral edge portion of an essentially flat blank for forming widened and thickened flange wall 13 . A series of relatively narrow, deep, V shaped grooves 12 are cold rolled. The poly V pulley thus produced has the flange wall with poly V grooves, from the intermediate portion of which a web 18 extends radially inward. This structure provides good dyna mic balance of rotation for the pulley and thus prolong life not only of the pulley per se but also a belt to be put around the pulley. Further, the manufacturing method allows to manufacture relatively small diameter poly V pulley.
