# Gas compressor or blower.

## Abstract
A gas compressor or blower having a piston rod 88 carry ing pistons 162, 173 working within cylinders 161, 172. The piston shaft is driven to rotate and reciprocate so that each piston rotates and reciprocates in its respective cylinder, ports being provided to allow induction and after compression exhaust the gas from each cylinder during such movement. Each cylinder comprises a plurality of circumferentially adjoining sealing segments such as 203, 204 supported from bridge pieces such as 104, 106 by adjusting bolts such as 114, 123 . Each segment can be set independently of the others relative to support plates 101, 103 so that the clearance between the inner surface of the segment and the confronting surface of the piston is sufficiently low to limit axial leakage between the piston surface and the segment surface without the need for any piston ring and to limit leakage to or from respective ports form in certain of the segments both axially and circumferentially of the piston.
