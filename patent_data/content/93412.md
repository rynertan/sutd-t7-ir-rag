# Magnetron sputtering apparatusand a method for forming a magnetic thinfilm on the surface of a substrate.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a magnetron sputtering apparatus including a sputtering chamber, a substrate and target disposed within the sputtering chamber to form a desired space therebetween, device for applying a voltage between the substrate and target, and device for producing a magnetic field and the apparatus comprises the magnetic field producing device adapted to excite a magnetic field so that the direction of the magnetic field may be inverted on the magnetic symmetry axis within the space. The magnetron sputtering apparatus of the present invention can form metal films having no crack without heating of the substrate and also form a magnetic recording film layer having a increased coercive force perpendicular to the surface of the film.
