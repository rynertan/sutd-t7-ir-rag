# Frequency control for point to multipoint radio.

## Abstract
A multipoint radio system has a single node which com municates with a plurality of outstations on one frequency. The outstations using a different single frequency to com municate with the node. The node controls the transmission frequency at the outstations, eg by transmitting error sig nals which adjust the set points of frequency control loops in the oustations. In a preferred embodiment the node allows for residual errors by adjusting the decision threshold of its regenerator to the outstation on transmission.
