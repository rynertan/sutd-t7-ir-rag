# Card frames.

## Abstract
A card frame for housing electrical circuitry mounted on cards comprises end plates 10 separated by front and rear cross rails 12, 14 that mount card guides 16 in which the cards can slide. Each card guide 16 comprises end elements 28a, 28b engageable with the front and rear cross rails 12, 14 in first and second positions Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 spaced in both the top to bottom and front to rear directions of the card frame. Each card guide 16 additionally comprises a shank 30 formed separately from the end members 28a, 28b and assembled with them. If the shank 30 is of a first length the end elements 28a, 28b will engage with the cross rails 12, 14 in the first positions to accommodate a card of a first height, whereas if the shank 30 is of a second, smaller length the end elements will engage with the cross rails in the second positions to accommodate a card of a second, greater height.
