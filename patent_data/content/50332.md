# Corona discharge poling process.

## Abstract
A process is described for preparing piezoelectric film using a corona discharge device wherein a multi layer of pellicles, of which at least one or more is a piezoelectric sensitive film 31 and at least one other of the multi layer is a companion pellicle 71 i.e. a pellicle with a conductance no less than that of the piezoelectric sensitive peliicle when the conductance is measured under the poling conditions of the corona dis charge and in the direction of the discharge field , is subjected to a corona discharge between a pair of electrodes 35, 37 , of which at least one such electrode 35 has a textured surface 43 .
