## Description
This invention relates to a sensor for detecting low concentrations of silane gas in the air according to patent claim 1 and to a process of manufacturing same according to patent claim 3. In semiconductor factories, chemical factories, laboratories and the like, large quantities are used of certain gases which can spontaneously ignite and combust upon contacting or mixing with air or other gases even when existing in concentrations of a few percent. Examples of these gases are monosilane SiH4 , dichlorosilane SiH2Cl2 , trichlorosilane SiHCl3 , phosphine PH3 , diborane B2H6 , and arsenic hydride AsH3 . There are increasing incidents of fires caused by the leaking of such gases into the atmosphere followed by their spontaneous ignition. For this reason, there is a great need for a gas sensor which can detect low concentrations of these gases. However, up to the present time no such sensor has been developed. From DE A 28 16 331 is known a device for detecting carbon monoxide with an element comprising stannic oxide as bulk material, platinum to increase the sensitivity to carbon monoxide, and antimony trioxide to improve the temperature stability. An improved carbon monoxides sensing element can be prepared by mixing stannic oxide, antimony oxychloride and platinum in ratios of Sb Sn 2 8 mol , Pt Sn 2 10 mol and calcining said mixture at a temperature of from 600 to 850 C. Such sensing element is claimed in the not prepublished EP A2 0 114 310. In the course of experiments, the present inventors discovered that if a heating means were added to the carbon monoxide sensing element described above and the element was thereby heated to 260 Specifically, in their experiments, the present inventors prepared a mixture of SnO₂ H₂PtCl₆, and SbOCl with a Pt Sn molar ratio of .04 and an Sb Sn molar ratio of .06 and coated this mixture on two alumina porcelain tubes each having a pair of electrodes. The tubes were then calcined at 700 5 The initial resistance in air R After the second measurement of resistance in clean air, the resistance in each gas was again measured. This time, for Tube A, R For the third and subsequent measurements of resistance, the resistance in air R The above experiment was repeated using different calcining temperatures and different compositions for the mixture coated on the tubes. The value of R The silane gas sensing apparatus achieved by adding a heater to the carbon monoxide sensing element of Japanese Application No. 57 226510 and heating the apparatus at 200 400 It is the object of the present invention to provide a sensor for detecting silane gases which can detect even low concentrations of gaseous silanes in the air. It is another object of the present invention to provide a sensor for silane gases which exhibits only a small change in its sensitivity over use. The apparatus for sensing silane gases according to the present invention is basically the carbon monoxide sensing element of Japanese Application No. 57 226510 to which a heater has been added and which has been exposed to silane gas in order to stabilize its sensitivity to silanes. A sensor for silane gas according to the present invention comprises a silane sensitive element prepared by mixing SnO₂, SbOCl, and Pt such that the molar ratio of Sb to Sn is approximately .02 .08 and the molar ratio of Pt to Sn is approximately .02 .10, and calcining the mixture at 600 850 C, and exposing said element to a silane atmosphere comprising from 25 to 1000 ppm silane gas SiH4 for approximately 12 hours, while heating the element to a temperature in the range of 50 to 850 C and means for heating said silane sensitive element to a desired temperature. A preferred silane gas sensor is obtained when the element is heated during the exposure to the silane gas to a temperature in the range of 325 5 C. A process for making a silane gas sensor according to the present invention comprises the steps of Figure 1 is a graph of the electrical resistance in various concentrations of SiH4 gas of the two different gas sensors according to the present invention. Figure 2 is a graph of the change in electrical resistance as a function of the number of times used of a silane gas sensor according to the present invention which was calcined in air. Curve b shows the resistance in SiH₄ gas and Curve a shows the resistance in clean air. Figure 3 is a graph of the change in electrical resistance as a function of the number of times used of a silane gas sensor according to the present invention which was calcined in an oxidized antimony gas atmoshphere. Curve b shows the resistance in SiH₄ gas and Curve a shows the resistance in clean air. A silane gas sensor according to the present invention and a method for manufacturing this apparatus will now be explained in connection with the following illustrative examples. An aqueous solution of H₂PtCl₆ was added to SnO₂ in an amount such that the molar ratio of Pt to Sn was 0.04 and was well dispersed using ultrasonic waves. The dispersed solution was quick frozen at 40 Sixteen identical gas sensors were prepared according to the above method. The tubes of the apparatuses were then heated to 325 The maximum value of R Next, the 16 sensors were exposed to different concentrations of SiH₄ gas. The values of R Using the same method as for Example 1, sensors having various values of the Pt Sn molar ratio, the Sb Sn molar ratio, the sintering temperature in air, the temperature for exposure to the SiH₄ gas atmosphere, and the concentration of the SiH₄ during exposure were prepared. The characteristics and preparation conditions of the examples are shown in Table 3. Examples 17 24 were comparative examples. For the comparative examples, either the composition or the preparation conditions were outside the limits prescribed for the present invention. The asterick marks in Table 3 indicate which item was not in accordance with the present invention. Example 1 of Table 2 and Example 1 of Table 3 represent different batches of sensors prepared using the same method. For each example, 16 sensors were prepared. As was done in Example 1, each of the sensors was preheated to 325 The results of measurement are shown in the Table 3 in the form R The values shown in Table 3 are the averages of 16 sensors. It can be seen that all of the examples of gas sensors according to the present invention Examples 1 16 shown in Table 3 had good sensitivity to SiH₄ gas, both initially and after 10 measurements, and thus showed good stability. However, as can been seen from the results for the comparative examples, if the Pt to Sn molar ratio is greater than approximately .10 Example 21 , the resulting sensors have a large change in sensitivity to SiH₄ gas, as indicated by a large value for R If the molar ratio of Sb to Sn is less than approximately .02 Example 19 , the value of R If the calcining temperature in air of a sensor is below approximately 600 The concentration of silane gas to which an sensor prepared according to the present invention is exposed is defined as being approximately 25ppm 1000ppm. If the concentration falls below this range Example 23 , the value of R All of the preceding examples involved calcining in air. However, a silane gas sensor according to the present invention can also be prepared by calcining in an oxidized antimony atmosphere. The following examples illustrate silane gas sensors according to the present invention prepared by this second method. In a manner similar to that used for Example 1, an aqueous solution of H₂PtCl₆ was added to SnO₂ in an amount such that the molar ratio of Pt to Sn was 0.04 and was well dispersed using ultrasonic waves. The dispersed solution was quick frozen at 40 Up until this point, the method was identical to that used in Example 1. However, instead of performing calcining in air as in Example 1, calcining was instead performed in an oxidized antimony atmosphere. The oxidized antimony atmosphere was prepared by preheating a quartz tube I.D. 40mm, length of the portion of tube lying within an electric furnace 500mm to 700 5 The naturally dried alumina porcelain tube was then encapsulated in the quartz tube and calcined in the oxidized antimony atmosphere at 700 5 After calcining, the alumina porcelain tube was removed from the quartz tube and an electric heater was installed therein. Then, as in the method used for Example 1, the porcelain tube was heated to 300 50 Sixteen sensors were prepared in this manner. The sensors were then heated to 325 The maximum value of R The electrical resistance of these sensors was also measured in different concentrations of SiH₄ gas. The results are plotted as Curve b of Figure 1. Using basically the same method as for Example 25, examples of gas sensors were prepared using various values for the Pt to Sn molar ratio, the Sb to Sn molar ratio, the calcining temperature in the oxidized antimony atmosphere, the temperature of the silane gas atmosphere to which each sensor was exposed during preparation, and the concentration of SiH₄ in the silane gas atmosphere. The composition and preparation conditions for each of the examples are shown in Table 5. Examples 41 48 were comparative examples in which either the composition or preparation conditions fell outside of the bounds prescribed for the present invention. Those items falling outside the prescribed bounds are marked by asterick marks in the table. For each example, sixteen sensors were prepared. As for the previous examples, each sensor was heated to 325 As can be seen from the results of measurements on the comparative examples, if the molar ratio of Pt to Sn is below approximately .02 Example 45 or above approximately .10 Example 46 , the value of R If the molar ratio of Sb to Sn is less than approximately .02 Example 43 , the value of R If the calcining temperature in the oxidized antimony atmosphere is less than approximately 600 If the SiH₄ gas atmosphere to which an sensor is exposed during preparation contains less than approximately 25ppm of SiH₄ Example 47 , the value of R In contrast, all of examples 26 40 prepared according to the present invention had good initial sensitivity to SiH₄ R In order to measure the sensitivity of sensors according to the present invention to silane gases other than SiH₄, the resistance of sensors identical to Example 27 was measured in either SiH₂Cl₂ or CH₃ ₃SiCl. To illustrate the effects of different concentrations of oxidized antimony in the oxidized antimony atmosphere used in calcining, Examples 49 60 of Tables 8 and 9 were prepared. Examples 49 54 were identical in composition and method of preparation to Example 32 of Table 5 except that the amount of SbOCl which was calcined to produce an oxidized antimony atmosphere was varied from 0.25mg to 7.5mg. Example 52 exactly corresponds to Example 32 . The effective volume in the quartz tube in which the SbOCl was calcined was 628 cm³, so the concentrations of oxidized Sb in the quartz tube ranged from 2.3 x 10 ⁹ to 6.9 x 10 ⁸ moles cm³. The examples of Table 9 were similar to those of Table 8 except that Sb₂O₃ was used in place of SbOCl. For each example, 6 elements were prepared. Each of the elements was then heated to 325 As can be seen from both tables, if the concentration of oxidized antimony in the oxidized antimony atmosphere lies between approximately 1 x 10 ⁹ to 3 x 10 ⁸ moles cm³, the resulting element has good sensitivity to SiH₄ gas R In all of the preceding examples, when the sensors were exposed to a silane gas atmosphere subsequent to calcining, the silane gas atmosphere was at 25 In the above described examples, calcining either in air or in an oxidized antimony atmosphere was carried out for 30 minutes, and exposure to a silane gas atmosphere was carried out for 10 minutes. However, calcining may be carried for 5 to 50 minutes, and exposure to a silane gas atmosphere may be carried out for 2 to 60 minutes. Whereas in the above examples the sensors were dried by natural drying after the application of a paste, drying may be performed in a constant temperature bath. In the above examples, aging of the sensors was performed in unheated air and the sensors were heated by their heaters. Alternatively, a sensor may be aged in a constant temperature bath without use of the sensor heater. As the solvent for preparing a paste, isopropyl alcohol was used in the above examples. However, other organic solvents may be used, such as an organic solvent comprising 25 by weight of beta terpineol, 72 by weight of ethyl cellulose, and 3 by weight of butyl carbitol acetate. Whereas an alumina porcelain tube was used as a base for the above mentioned paste in the above examples, an electrical insulator which can withstand calcining having a tubular, plate like, or other shape can be used instead. The heating means provided in the sensor may be a conventional electrical heater or may be an infrared lamp or the like. In the above examples, the oxidized antimony atmosphere was prepared by calcining SbOCl or Sb₂O₃ Alternatively, the atmosphere may be prepared from a solid such as SbCl₃ or a gas such as SbH₃. As the silane gas atmosphere to which sensors were exposed following calcining, SiH₄ in air was used in the above examples. However, SiH₂Cl₂, C₂H₅O ₄Si, SiCl₄, CH₃ ₂SiCl₂, or other silane may be used instead of SiH₄.
