# Book making apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Apparatus for producing large books includes two apparatuses 50, 54, 58, 62 and 52, 56, 60, 64 which may be used independently to produce normal books. Each has a printing press 50, 52 for producing signatures, and a bindery 54, 56. Diverting means 66 are operable to take the output of the first press 50 and combine it with the output of the second press 52. Thus different portions of a large book may be printed by the two presses and then combined.
