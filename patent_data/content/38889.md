# Automatic cigar wrapping device.

## Abstract
A device for applying a chevron shaped cigar wrapper blank W around a double cigar body B comprising a mechanically driven nest including a plurality of parallel dri ven substantially cylindrical rods 60, 62, 64, 66 with body contacting surface for rotating the cigar body, a conveyor for moving the wrapper to the path of the nest such that the apex 24 converges with the midsection of the body B and a tuck lifter 212 for lifting the apex 24 of the blank W into contact with a midsection of the cigar body is improved by modifying certain driving rods 64,66 of the nest to provide clearance for the tuck lifter. This reduces the criticality of the operation of the tuck lifter. Clearance is provided by the provision of an axial gap in the aforementioned rods 64,66 .
