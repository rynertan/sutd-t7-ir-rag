## Abstract
A raster output scanner with laser diode and a holog raphic beam scanning system, an anti reflective coating 36 on the diode internal cavity facet 34 such that the diode internal cavity functions as a gain medium only, an exterior cavity 39 with lens for collimating radiation emitted by the diode into a bundle of parallel beams, a holographic grating for dispersing the beams by wavelengths, and means 50, 65, 70 for reflecting the beams at only one wavelength back on itself through the grating and lens to the diode front facet to force the diode to operate in a single longitudinal mode at the one wavelength. A second embodiment provides a unitary structure housing the laser diode and the external cavity forming elements with the beam splitting mirror in the form of a prism to guide the single mode beam of the diode along the scanner optical path. A third embodiment replaces the beam splitting mirror with a totally reflecting mirror, and a fourth embodiment replaces both the grating and beam splitting mirror by a reflective grating.
