# Polymer mixture comprising a polyphenylene ether and optionally a polystyrene and or a rubber modified polystyrene, and articles formed therefrom.

## Abstract
Polyphenylene ethers may show the property that their molecular weight increases considerably upon extrusion. This increase of the molecular weight leads to less good flow properties. It has been found that the addition of a con jugated, non aromatic diene compound or of a dienophilic compound suppresses the increase of the molecular weight under extrusion.
