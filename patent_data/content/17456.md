# Crystalline co polybenzyls and process of producing them.

## Abstract
Crystalline co polybenzyls useful in general thermoplas tic applications are prepared by the polymerization of 2,5 dimethylbenzyl chloride with a different 2,5 dialkyl ben zyl halide in the presence of a Ziegler type catalyst. The co polybenzyls are represented by the structural formula
