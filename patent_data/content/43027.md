# Electronic signature verification method and system.

## Abstract
Electronic signature and message verification is obtained using a central vault which is a physically secured Authenticator designed as a hardware automaton not under control of any operating system. All secure electronic signature verification transactions between terminals users at stations A and B are transacted through the vault. The vault and all terminals include an identical key controlled block ciper cryptographic facility wherein each user at a terminal has access only to his own key and wherein the vault has access to all user keys. User A first sends to the vault a message comprising a clear first part and an encrypted second part. The vault obtains A s key from the clear first part and decrypts the second part. The vault transmits to user B all encrypted under B s key, the encrypted second part and the decrypted second part, and user B performs a decryption using his key, and stores said encrypted second part. User B then initiates an equivalent return message procedure to user A via the vault. At the end of a transaction, user A and user B each have uniquely encrypted messages which can be utilized in later arbitration proceedings wherein user A cannot later deny having sent a message or its content and similarly user B cannot deny having received the message or its specific content.
