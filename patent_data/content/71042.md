# Memory array.

## Abstract
An electronic data storage or memory array having DC stable memory cells which utilize the principle of a unique substrate biasing mechanism, whereby a channel region defined by resistive substrate material and formed under a controlled electrode 20 becomes pinched off and, in the process, so affects the DC potential at that electrode as to maintain the pinched off condition. Consequently, the mem ory cell becomes established in a first DC stable state one state . The principle is preferably embodied in a field effect transistor 22 , the resistive channel region being connected in a DC conductive path to a fixed resistor R1 and a potential source V . Accordingly, when appropriate signal levels representing a binary one are applied to word and bit lines WL1, BL1 connected to a first controlling, or gate, electrode and to a second controlling electrode, respectively, of the FET, the described pinch off occurs, with concomitant ly high resistance R2 in the DC path, such that the potential adjacent the controlled electrode 20 is maintained in the one state that was initiated by the signals on the word and bit lines. On the other hand, when signals representing a zero are applied to the same controlling electrodes, the resistive channel region R2 under the controlled electrode 20 is no longer pinched off, whereby the memory cell becomes established in the second or zero DC stable state. Means for reading the stored data in the cell are integrated with the cell.
