# Adaptive electronic buffer amplifier system.

## Abstract
An adaptive electronic buffer system in which a set circuit 10 generates logic set signals for the buffer circuits 20 . Parallel sub buffers are switched on or off by the set sig nals, so that the specified charging and discharging times of the output 22 can be achieved. This setting compensates for the manufacturing process variations and operating conditions temperature, supply voltage of the buffer circuits 20 . The spread in the output conductance is reduced, thus reducing the risk of fast current variations, inductive voltage peaks and the associated loss of data.
