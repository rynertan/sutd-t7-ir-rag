# Integral brake and decoupling mechanism.

## Abstract
An integral brake and decoupling mechanism, which is particularly although not exclusively suitable for use with a hand held power saw, includes a drive shaft coupled to the motor of the saw and disposed adjacent to the drive shaft. First and second cylindrical surfaces on the drive shaft and drive cylinder, respectively, are engaged by a coil spring which functions to transfer torque from the drive cylinder to the drive shaft. The coil spring, drive cylinder and drive shaft rotate in unison during the transfer of torque from the motor to the blade. A mechanism is provided for selectively stopping rotation of the coil spring thereby decoupling the drive shaft from applied torque. A detecting mechanism is provided for sensing an abrupt movement of the saw for activating the stopping mechanism. Upon decoupling, overriding torque generated by the coil spring rapidly arrests rotation of the saw blade.
