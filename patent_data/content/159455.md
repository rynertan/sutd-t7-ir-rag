# System for producing wood tiles with listel components for the building industry.

## Abstract
The composition is obtained by approaching on the quadrilateral sides as many sets of iistels 1, 2, 3, 4 oblique ly cut off in order to get the adherence among the same on the diagonals. By employing a central square part 14 and a like set of listel components 1, 2, 3, 4 cut at 45 , a square tile can be obtained. The integral bond of the components on their adhesion walls is carried out by means of seizing and riveting points 15 on the plane standing behind. The tile can be set to work on a mastic bed.

## Description
System for producing wood floor tiles with listel components for the building industry .The invention refers to a new principle proceeding for manufacturing wood floor tiles, for the building industry and furnishings, which substantially foresees to fit integrally, around a quadrilateral cen tral part, a set of listels in parallel in adherence on the diagonal.The listel may have either a rectangular or square shape.The proceeding employs for the composition parts of different shape forming the central part, and singular components forming the set of listels, thus allowing to obtain composed forms like those of the present systems which can be merely carried out with the conven tional methods. At present, in order to get a quick mounting and an exposing plane not uniform in respect to the base system which employs singular listels by approaching, a second process foresees the fitting, by means of mastic, of a set of listels in parallel on the back square leaning base. In this case, the variability of the exposition plane drawing is obtained by setting the work the tiles on line with alternate orienting of the listels. If using this second proceeding, however, only one modular component does not obviate the repetioning effect of the base system. Moreover, respect to The former system enabling to fix the listels by means of riveting, the second proceeding carries out a precarious binding condition on the leaning slab on account of leaning base which fixes the listels on mastic.The presence of a drawing resulting from the combination of more components is a firYEunental point in good quality pavements and panels, however, these executions at present turn out to be particular ly expensive since they require the manufacture of separate components in different shapes, their classification and, therefore, their mount ing according to schemes of composition previously foreseen.The invent ed system permits a sector industrial advancement by performing a tile which can be quickly installed and foresees a drawing in exposing plane resulting from the combination of more components with different geo metre. This is possible because a form of composition is foreseen which can be carried out by approachlng, to the sides of a quadrilater part, four sets of listels obliquely truncated obtaining the adherence of the same sets. The components of the drawing, therefore, are given by the central part having a square structure, operating as a bulged mass as the centre of the figure and by each component of the sets operating as longitudinal component with different length tapering towards the centre.In this way, by employing a square tile, five forms will result in composition, four of which that compose the set, employed in four different drawing positions. In particular, when carrying out the square tile, the listel components will turn out to be truncated at roc50. Once the wished form is carried out by approaching the walls, the solidarity bound of the components of each listel set is obtained by means of clawing points. The integral bound of the four sets, which enables to get the tile, can be carried out by binding the equal listel components of the sets by means of riveting points which ensure an efficient binding condition on the diagonals.An execution fonm is illustrated in a merely indicative way and, as such, not limiting the proceeding, by the drawings of Table 1, where fig. 1 is the back side of the tile to show the clawing and rivetting binding poirrts. The central part can be observed which is con nected only by means of the clawing point pair to the intial component of two of the counterposed sets. The binding between the sets through two clawing points can be observed too which bind the listels by two, as well as the binding of the four sets obtained by means of other clawing points. Fig. 2 is the perspective view of the tile. Fig.3 is the view of the set components and of the central part.A square tile is manufactured with a cropper which, by cutting off at 450, fnrms the listel components 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the four sets. These one have an isosceles trapezium shape with slanting sides 5 and 6, 7 and 8, 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 symmetrical and arranged at 45 . The binding condition of the set of the listel components is obtained by connecting them with clawing points 13 applied on line by pairs. The binding between to sets of listels and the central body 14 is also obtained by clawing points. At last, the two renain ing sets are brought in composition too and are integrally bound to the first ones by means of riveting points on the composition diagonals.The tile shape may be square, rectangular or in connection with the employ requirements. The number of the components around the central part may vary. The tiles can be carried out in wood essences, derivated or other.
