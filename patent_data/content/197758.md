# Tone restoring apparatus.

## Abstract
In a tone restoring apparatus. a first and a second hold circuit 4, 5 latch at a period of 2T data signals read from a digital memory 2 in response to a first and a second address supplied to the digital memory 2 , and a first and second multiplier circuit multiply the data signals latched in the first and second hold circuit by a monotonously increas ing weighting function W₁ x 0 x NT, 0 W₁ x 1 or a monotonously increasing weighting function W₂ x 0 x NT, 0 W₂ x 1 . An adder circuit 8 adds the output signals from the first and second multiplier cirucits to each other.
