# IMPROVED MODIFIED PET POLYMERS AND COPOLYMERS FOR EXTRUSION BLOW MOLDING

## Abstract
There is disclosed an improved modified polymer suit able for use in making hollow containers by conventional extrusion blow molding. It is a specific type of end capped and branched polyethylene terephthalate polymer or copolymer. In the improvement, a the end cap comprises the reacted component of a monofunctional acid having a normal boiling point or sublimation point less than above 200 C and b the monofunctional acid is an aromatic monocarboxylic acid having the formula
