# Button.

## Abstract
A tack member 12 , which is adapted to be joined with a button body 11 for attachment of a button 10 to a garment fabric 13 , has a shank 23 of a hollow and solid combined structure. The shank 23 is composed of a tapering hollow end portion 24 and a solid base portion 25 . The hollow end portion 24 is deformable into a balloon like shape radially swelled and axially compressed as its tip end 24a is forced against a cap 16 of the button body 11 on its inner side during insertion of the shank 23 into a hollow hub 17 of the button body 11 , during which time the solid base portion 25 opposes bending or other deformation.
