# A hot melt adhesive composition.

## Abstract
The service temperature of hot melt adhesive compositions containing a partially hydrogenated thermoplastic elastomeric block copolymer, a tackifying resin and a mineral hydrocarbon oil is increased by the presence of a low molecular weight polyphenylene ether resin having a viscosity average molecular weight M The improved compositions are preferably used in the preparation of pressure sensitive adhesive tapes which are used where high service temperatures are required, for example, in paint shops where service temperatures of 110 120 C are desired.
