# EYE MOVEMENT MONITORING TECHNIQUE

## Abstract
An eye movement detection scheme is provided whereby both a subject s eye movements and the scene being viewed can be monitored simultaneously with compact, light, unob trusive yet effective equipment. Scene mounting as well as eye movement monitoring devices 19, 13 are mounted on a spectacle frame 1 worn by the subject. Signals from these devices are conveyed electrically and or optically from these frame mounted devices to circuitry 23 for generating video compatible signals so that the eye movements can be superimposed over the scene for purposes of observation and analysis. An additional advantage is a feature which facilitates use of corrective lenses suitable to the individual subject so that eye glass wearers can use the equipment as well.
