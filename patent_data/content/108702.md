# SERIAL TO PARALLEL DATA CONVERSION CIRCUIT

## Abstract
Serial to parallel conversion circuitry achieves phase synchronization and signal bit sampling of received asyn chronous serial data through use of a gate enable delay line oscillator having a selected response time, and selectably enabled in the presence of the received serial data to provide a sampling clock signal for shifting the serial data into register for parallel formatting at a frequency equal to the line frequency.
