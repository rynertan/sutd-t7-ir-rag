## Description
This invention relates to a method for manufacturing various kinds of discrete semiconductor devices or a semiconductor device such as a semiconductor integrated circuit device and so on. Upon manufacturing various kinds of semiconductor devices, there is frequently employed such a process for selectively etching a semiconductor layer such as a polycrystalline semiconductor layer or amorphous semiconductor layer. With reference to Figs. 1 to 9, an example of a prior art method for manufacturing a semiconductor device by forming a polycrystalline silicon semiconductor layer on a silicon substrate and then selectively etching the same will be described. In this example, an NPN type bipolar transistor is obtained. At first, as shown in Fig. 1, there is prepared a P type single crystalline silicon substrate 1 and an N type buried region 2 is formed on a main surface 1a thereof by a selective diffusion process or the like. As shown in Fig. 2, an N type silicon semiconductor layer 3 is epitaxially grown on the whole of the main surface 1a of the substrate 1 to thereby form a single crystalline silicon substrate 4. As shown in Fig. 3, a thick oxide insulating layer 5 is formed in the silicon semiconductor layer 3 of the substrate 4 by a selective thermal oxidizing the same except portions 3a and 3b in which an emitter or base region and a collector deriving electrode are to be formed respectively on the buried layer 2. As shown in Fig. 4, on the semiconductor layer 3 including the oxide insulating layer 5, there is thoroughly formed a P type impurity, for example, boron B doped polycrystalline silicon semiconductor layer 6 by a chemical vapor deposition method CVD method and this polycrystalline silicon semiconductor layer is patterned by selectively etching other portions except the portions which will finally become a base electrode derive region and a base electrode, for example. Then, on the whole surface including the polycrystalline silicon semiconductor layer 6, there is formed an oxide mask layer 7 of an SiO₂ similarly by, for example, the CVD method. As shown in Fig. 5, the photolithography is carried out for the mask layer 7 to selectively form a window 7a through a part thereof on the portion 3a of the semiconductor layer 3, particularly a portion on which the emitter region will be formed finally and the polycrystalline silicon layer 6 is selectively etched out through the window 7a so as to form a window 6a therethrough corresponding to the window 7a. As shown in Fig. 6, using the polycrystalline silicon layer 6 and the mask layer 7 thereon as a mask, a P type impurity doped region 8 is formed by selectively ion implanting a P type impurity, for example, boron B into the portion 3a of the semiconductor layer 3 through the windows 7a and 6a. As shown in Fig. 7, an SiO₂ oxide insulating layer 9 is formed thoroughly on the mask layer including the region 8 so as to close the window 7a by the CVD method or the like. Further, the ion implanted region 8 is activated by the annealing so as to become a base region, and a high concentration region 8a for use in deriving the base electrode is formed, for example, around the base region 8 by diffusing the impurities to the portion 3a from the impurity doped polycrystalline silicon layer 6 deposited directly on the portion 3a. As shown in Fig. 8, a window 9a is formed through a part of the region 8 by the photolithography of the oxide insulating layer 9 and a window 10 is formed on the other portion 3b of the semiconductor layer 3 by selectively etching the oxide insulating layer 9 and the mask layer 7 formed beneath the oxide insulating layer so as to expose the portion 3b to the outside. Then, an emitter region 11 and a low resistance region 12 for use in deriving a collector electrode are respectively formed by, for example, ion implanting N type impurity through these windows 9a and 10. As shown in Fig. 9, a window 13 is formed on a part of the polycrystalline silicon layer 6 contacting with the base electrode deriving region 8a so as to expose the polycrystalline silicon layer, and through the windows 9a, 10 and 13, there are respectively formed metal electrodes, for example, aluminium electrodes of an emitter electrode 14, a collector electrode 15 and a base electrode 16. In this case, a thin silicon polycrystalline layer 17 is formed by the CVD method, if necessary. As described above, an NPN type bipolar transistor is formed in the substrate 4 in which on the low resistance buried region 2, a part 18 of the portion 3a of the semiconductor layer 3 is made as the collector region the base region 8 is formed thereon and the emitter region 11 are formed thereon. According to the method for manufacturing the bipolar transistor as mentioned above, since the base electrode deriving region 8a of the base region 8 is formed by diffusing the impurities from the polycrystalline silicon semiconductor layer 6 which directly contact with the portion 3a of the semiconductor layer 3 and forms a part of the base electrode, a positional relation between the region 8a and the polycrystalline silicon layer 6 as the base electrode can be determined automatically, or they can be self aligned. As a result, it is easy to derive the base electrode from the narrow surface portion of the base region. However, in the case of being accompanied with the selective etching process like the above method for manufacturing the semiconductor device as mentioned above, there arise various problems. These problems will be described with reference to Fig. 10. Fig. 10 is an enlarged cross sectional view illustrating a main part of Fig. 7 under the state that the oxide insulating layer 9 is removed therefrom. In Fig. 10, like parts corresponding to those of Fig. 7 are marked with the same references. The first problem is When the polycrystalline silicon layer 6 is etched by a normal wet etching process, its etching rate has an isotropic property so that the etching window 6a of the polycrystalline layer becomes large in size as compared with the window 7a of the oxide mask layer 7, or a so called side etching occurs so that the etching window spreads into the under peripheral edge of the window 7a. As a result, when the region 8a is formed by diffusing the impurity of the polycrystalline silicon layer 6 to the semiconductor layer 3, a gap The above discussed first problem can be avoided by using a 2 step etching process as described e.g. in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 21, No. 10, March 1979, page 4236 by L. M. Ephrath. In a first step, the polycrystalline silicon is partially etched by reactive ion etching. The remainder of the layer is etched in a solution of pyrocatechol in ethylene diamine. The undercutting that occurs in this step is acceptable, since only a thin remaining layer is etched. However, even with this 2 step etching, other problems remain, which will not be explained in the following. The second problem is When the previously impurity doped polycrystalline silicon layer is used, if in the semiconductor integrated circuit a resistance element is formed by the other portion of the polycrystalline silicon layer, this portion is used also as the base electrode so that it is formed to have a low resistivity. As a result, in the portion which is used as the resistance element, the pattern thereof is formed as a fine pattern and the length of the resistance element is increased so that the high or large integrated scale of the integrated circuit is lowered. The third problem is Since the surface of the polycrystalline silicon layer 6 takes the form of concavity and convexity due to its particle, when the selective etching is carried out through the window 7a of the oxide layer 7 formed on this polycrystalline silicon layer, if the depth of the etching is confined to the surface of the semiconductor layer 3, a concave and convex surface 19 which inherits the concavity and convexity of the surface of the polycrystalline silicon layer 6 is formed. When such concave and convex surface 19 is formed, also the under surface of the base region 8 formed by the ion implantation from the surface 19 takes the form of concavity and convexity so that if the emitter region 11 is formed on this base region as described in connection with Fig. 8, the base width, or the distance between the emitter and the collector becomes irregular. Thus, there occur accidents such as a so called punch through and so on, and in addition a stable characteristic can not be obtained because of the unstable concave and convex surface and the characteristic thereof has poor control property and reproducibility. It is the object of the present invention to provide a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device comprising an improved sequence of steps concerning the etching of the polycrystalline silicon layer. The method according to the present invention for manufacturing a semiconductor device comprises the steps of Problem 1, concerning the undercutting, as discussed above, does not occur due to a 2 step etching as known from the above cited IBM Article. However, the undercutting can be reduced even more when an annealing process is performed between the two etching steps. This is the object of claim 2. Due to the annealing process, the concentration of implanted ions becomes lower in the remaining layer which has finally to be etched away isotropically, than in the adjacent parts of the non etched layer. The lower the impurity concentration, the higher the rate of isotropic etching. Therefore, the remaining layer is removed with a higher velocity than the adjacent parts of the layer by the isotropic etching. This obviously reduces undercutting. The second problem does not arise any longer as ions are implanted into the semiconductor layer not during the growth of the layer but afterwards. This makes it possible to provide the grown layer with low resistivity in its parts where it acts as an electrode layer, but with high resistivity in its parts where it acts as e.g. a resistance element. The third problem does not occur any longer due to the combination of several features. Ions are implanted into the semiconductor layer in such a way that the projection range, i. e. the implantation depth indicative of the peak value of the concentration, is distant from the boundary between the layer and the substrate, and the anisotropic etching is performed to a depth larger than the projection range. Additionally a monocrystalline semiconductor substrate is used, having a surface of a predetermined crystallographic orientation. The isotropic etching is made with a crystallographic etchant having a small etching rate for said predetermined orientation. Due to these features, the part of the layer remaining after the anisotropic etching can be etched very fast by the crystallographic etchant, whereas the substrate is etched very slowly. Therefore, the surface of the substrate remains flat. Referring initially to Fig. 11 and the followings, an embodiment of the method for manufacturing a semiconductor device according to this invention will be described in association with the similar NPN type bipolar transistor which was previously explained in connection with Figs. 1 to 9. In Fig. 11 and the followings, like parts corresponding to those of Figs. 1 to 9 are marked with the same references. As shown in Figs. 11 to 13, this invention takes the same processes as those of Figs. 1 to 3. That is, also in this embodiment, the silicon semiconductor layer 3 is epitaxially grown on, for example, the silicon semiconductor substrate 1 of the single crystal to thereby form the silicon substrate 4. As the substrate 4, there can be used such one of which the surface direction has 111 crystalline surface. In other words, the major surface 1a of the substrate 1 shown in Fig. 11 is selected to be the 111 crystalline surface so that the surface direction of the silicon semiconductor layer to be formed thereon is to have the 111 crystalline surface. Then, as shown in Fig. 14, on the substrate 4 with the surface direction selected to be Miller indices 111 , there is formed, for example, a polycrystalline silicon layer 26 so as to have a thickness of, for example, 3000 Å i.e. 300 nm, since 10 Å 1 nm by the CVD method. Particularly in this invention, when the polycrystalline silicon semiconductor layer 26 is formed, a polycrystalline silicon layer is initially formed with no impurity doped thereto and then impurity ion such as B , BF 2 or As and so on are implanted into the predetermined portion thereof with a predetermined impurity concentration distribution. In this case, the ion implantation to the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 is desired such that in order to prevent the concentration of the semiconductor layer 3 from being affected by the ion implantation as much as possible, the layer having the peak value of the impurity concentration distribution lies in the position distant from the boundary surface between the semiconductor layer 3 and the polycrystalline silicon layer, for example, the intermediate portion with respect to the thickness direction of the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 or the surface side thereof. As shown in Fig. 15, the oxide mask layer 7 is formed similarly on the whole surface area of the semiconductor layer by, for example, the CVD method. As shown in Fig. 16, the window 7a same as that of Fig. 5 is formed through the oxide mask layer 7 by, for example, photolithography and through this window 7a, the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 formed beneath the window is selectively etched to form a window 26a corresponding to the window 7a. Then, as shown in Fig. 17, P type impurity, for example, boron B is ion implanted to the portion 3a of the semiconductor layer 3 exposed through the windows 7a and 26a to thereby form an ion implanted region 8. As shown in Fig. 18, the same oxide insulating layer 9 as that of Fig. 7 is formed, by annealing the same, the ion implanted region 8 is activated so as to make the base region and P type impurity from the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 is diffused, for example, to the peripheral portion of the base to thereby form the base electrode deriving region 8a. As shown in Fig. 19, similar to Fig. 8, the insulating layer 9 which is on the base region 8 in the portion 3a of the semiconductor layer 3 and the insulating layers 7 and 9 on the portion 3b are respectively etched by the photolithography to thereby form windows 9a and 10. Then, N type impurity is ion implanted through these windows so as to form the emitter region 11 and the collector electrode deriving region 12 of low resistivity, respectively. As shown in Fig. 20, a window 13 is formed through the mask layers 7 and 9 formed on a part of the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 by the photolithography which becomes the base electrode. The base electrode 16 is formed on this portion and the collector electrode 15 and the emitter electrode 14 are respectively deposited on the regions 12 and 11 in ohmic contact. These electrodes 14, 15 and 16 can respectively be formed as desired patterns by selectively etching aluminium electrodes and so on which were evaporated on the whole surface of the regions. Also in this case, the thin polycrystalline silicon layer 17 can be formed on the surfaces thereof by the CVD method and the like as required. As described above, it becomes possible to obtain the same NPN type bipolar transistor as that of Fig. 9. Particularly in accordance with the manufacturing method of this invention, a special method is employed to form the window 26a through the polycrystalline silicon layer 26. That is, when the window 26a is formed through the polycrystalline silicon layer 26, the side etching which will enter into the under side of the peripheral edge of the window 7a of the mask layer 7 shown in Fig. 21 is not caused. To this end, in the process for forming the window 26a as shown in Fig. 16, the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 is etched away by a combination of the dry etching process capable of the etching with directivity therefor, for example, a reactive ion etching RIE and the crystallographic wet etching having isotropy relative to the polycrystalline silicon layer 26. More particularly, as, for example, shown in Fig. 22, the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 is firstly etched through the window 7a by the dry etching of RIE so that the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 is etched away to a predetermined depth Consequently, since the bottom surfaces of the emitter region 11 and the base region 8 formed by the ion implantation from the smooth surface of the portion 3a of the semiconductor layer 3 are respectively formed as the flat surfaces, the gap therebetween, or the base width can be obtained uniformly, stably and with good reproducibility. Further, since the emitter region 11 can be prevented from being punched through to the collector region due to the concavity and convexity of the surface, it is possible to obtain the transistor, or the semiconductor device of high reliability. As noted above, according to this invention, the window 26a is bored through the polycrystalline semiconductor layer 26 by the combination of the anisotropic etching based on, for example, the RIE and the isotropic etching based on the crystallographic etching. In this case, since in the RIE dry etching, the etching can proceed with directivity, or the etching can proceed only in substantially the thickness direction of the polycrystalline semiconductor layer 26, if the most of the thickness Further, the occurrence of the side etching can be avoided by the combination of the dry etching and the wet etching based on the crystallographic etching as mentioned above. According to employing this method, it becomes possible to obviate a disadvantage of the etching process in a case where the concentration of impurity implanted into the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 is increased so as to afford a sufficiently low resistivity. To be more concrete, when an impurity ion such as B , BF 2, As , P , Si and so on is ion implanted into the polycrystalline silicon layer, the etching rate of the etching is extremely lowered in portion where the above ion is highly doped. In this case, however, when the impurity ion is preliminarily doped into the polycrystalline silicon layer 26, if the peak of the concentration distribution of the impurity concentration lies at the intermediate portion remote from the boundary surface between the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 and the semiconductor layer 3 or at the surface side, in the afore described dry etching, the etching proceeds to the portion in which the impurity ion is doped with a high concentration, for example, to the position lower than the depth exhibiting the peak value of the concentration. Then the wet etching can be carried out properly, as the impurity highly doped portion is removed. Accordingly, since enough impurities are doped into the remained polycrystalline silicon layer 26 which will become electrodes and a wiring element, the electrode deriving region 8a of low resistance can be formed by diffusing the impurities therefrom into the semiconductor layer 3 and further the remained polycrystalline silicon layer itself can become the electrode of low resistivity or the wiring element. Further, the effects achieved in a case where the selective etching is carried out by using the dry etching based on the RIE and the succeeding wet etching will be described in detail with reference to Fig. 24 and the followings in association with an impurity concentration to an etching rate. In Fig. 24, a broken line curve 31 indicates a concentration distribution of an impurity in the polycrystalline semiconductor layer in a case where BF 2 ion of 5 x 10¹⁵ dose was implanted into the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 at an acceleration of 60 keV. In this case, the depth indicative of the peak value of the concentration, or Rp projection range is about 440 Å. Referring to the figure, a solid line curve 32 indicates a like concentration distribution of an impurity in the polycrystalline silicon layer in a case where B ion of 5 x 10¹⁵ dose was ion implanted into the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 at an acceleration of 30 keV. In this case, the projection range Rp indicative of the peak value of the concentration became about 1000 Å. The etching rates of the crystallographic wet etching for the polycrystalline silicon layers exhibiting the concentration distributions 31 and 32 are, as shown by a broken line curve 41 and a solid line curve 42 in Fig. 25, respectively, almost zero in the portions having high concentration distributions but become suddenly high in the portions having low concentration distributions. As mentioned above, the ion implantation concentration and the etching rate considerably depend on each other in the polycrystalline silicon layer. Accordingly, when the ion is implanted into the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 with the concentration distribution of the thickness direction as shown by the curve 31 in Fig. 24, if the dry etching is carried out to the depth Further, after the afore said dry etching but prior to the succeeding wet etching, if the annealing is carried out, the side etching can be suppressed more. That is, when the impurity is ion implanted into the polycrystalline silicon layer with a concentration distribution shown by a solid line curve 51 in Fig. 26, if, at that time, the polycrystalline silicon layer is subjected to the annealing, or the annealing after the ion implantation, the impurity at the peak portion is diffused to thereby present a moderate characteristic as shown by a broken line curve 51 in the figure. However, when the polycrystalline silicon layer having such concentration distribution 51 is removed from the surface to the position of the depth In this case, when the ion implantation is selected to be not lower than 10¹⁹ atoms cm³, its etching rate is lowered rapidly as mentioned becore. For this reason, it is desired to select the ion implantation condition such that after the annealing, the concentration in other portion than the portion with the groove formed by the dry etching exceed 10¹⁹ atoms cm³. If the concentration is selected as mentioned above, the resistivity of the aforementioned polycrystalline silicon layer can be made low enough to be used as a part of, for example, the base electrode. As described above, by a series of processes of the dry etching, the annealing and the wet etching in this order, the selectively fined pattern can be formed on the polycrystalline silicon layer 26 by the etching in fined degree. While in the above described embodiment the selective etching on the polycrystalline silicon layer is described, the above etching can be applied to manufacturing methods accompanied with an etching process of other polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductor layer with the similar effects being achieved. While in the above described embodiment the present invention is applied to the method for manufacturing the NPN type bipolar transistor, the present invention can be applied to a case in which various discrete semiconductor devices or various semiconductor integrated circuit devices such as a high or large integrated circuit and so on are obtained. As described above, according to the present invention, since the side etching can be controlled arbitrarily by the application of the concentration distribution determined by the ion implantation of impurity and the combination with the dry etching, the fined pattern of the polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductor layer can be formed as desired. Thus, it is possible to obtain the semiconductor device of high reliability and a high or large integration of, for example, the semiconductor integrated circuit can be attained. Further, in the manufacturing method of this invention, after the polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductor layer is formed, the impurity is ion implanted thereto. Accordingly, if the concentration pattern of the ion implantation is selected, when the resistance element is formed by the polycrystalline silicon layer in, for example, the semiconductor integrated circuit and so on, the resistivity of this portion can be increased so that the pattern of the resistance element can be made small, increasing the high or large integrated degree of the integrated circuit. As set forth above, when the crystallographic etching is applied, the surface of the polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductor layer where the portion is removed by etching can be formed as the smooth surface so that it is possible to obtain the semiconductor device of good stability, high reliability and good reproducibility.
