# Methods of and apparatus for sintering tubular ceramic articles.

## Abstract
In a pass through sintering furnace for sintering a suc cession of ceramic tubes 18, 19 fed lengthwise through the furnace 10, 11, 12 and rotated as they pass through the fur nace, the tubes 18, 19 , when heated in the furnace 10, 11, 12 , are kept apart by pushing each tube 18, 19 into the fur nace at one end with a pusher 24, 25, 26 and pulling it out from the other end with a puller 30 35 . The pulling speed is less than the pushing speed to ensure uniform firing through out the length of the tube, allowing for shrinkage as the tube is fired, but is sufficient to hold the pulled tube clear of the next following tube so as to obviate any pushing against the end of a hot tube.
