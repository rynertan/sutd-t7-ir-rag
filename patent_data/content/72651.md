# Wear reducing projectile.

## Abstract
A projectile suitable for firing from a gun barrel contains an additive which is dispensed along the gun barrel by the pressure of a gas propellant so as to reduce barrel wear. A charge of additive 11 is stored within a cylindrical recess in the rear face 12 of the projectile. In use, the pressure of the gas propellant acts on a nylon piston 6 slidably located within the tube 2 , which piston in turn pressurizes the charge 11 forcing it forward through the four extrusion ports 9 to the exterior of the projectile. The charge of additive 11 is preferably a mixture of a thermal insulator and a lubricant, best characterized by silicone oil or a paste mixture of titanium dioxide and silicone grease. The invention is particularly applicable to small arms bullets for firing from a rifled gun barrel, and may be incorporated in existing hollowed bullets, for example tracer bullets.
