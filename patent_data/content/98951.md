Gos.Farm, Inst., Perm, USSR Deposited Document 1981 VINITI 2966 81 June 1, 1981 describe the synthesis and antimicrobial activity of arylamides of N 4 pyridyl anthranilic acid. The invention relates to compounds having theFormulas I, IA or IB EMI2.1 wherein R is NH2, NH alkyl having 1 7 carbon atoms, 2furanylmethylamino, 2 thienylmethylamino, N alkyl 2 having 2 5 carbon atoms, l morpholinyl, 4 methyl l piperazinyl, orEMI2.2 wherein Y is a straight or branched chain alkylene radical having 4 8 carbon atoms and forming with the nitrogen atom a 5 8 membered ring, optionally substituted by a hydroxy group R is H, O2N, halogen, alkyl or 1 3 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1 3 carbon atoms, HO or Z NO2S, where Z N is amino, phenylamino, alkylamino or dialkylamino, alkyl having 1 3 carbon atoms R is H or alkyl of 1 3 carbon atoms R is H, 2 propenyl or alkyl of 1 3 carbon atoms and R is NH2 or l piperidinyl or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition or quaternary ammonium salt thereof. Compositions for lowering the blood pressure of a hypertensive mammal comprise an antihypertensively effective amount of a compound of Formula I together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. One can lower the blood pressure of a hypertensive mammal by administering to said mammal a composition comprising an antihypertensively effective amount of a compound of Formula I. One can prepare a compound of Formula I where R is other than hydroxy by converting a compound having theFormula II, IIA or IIB EMI3.1 to its acid halide, wherein halide is chloride, bromide or iodide, and reacting the latter with a compound of the formula H R. One can prepare any compound of Formula I by reacting a compound having the Formula III, IIIA or IIIB EMI3.2 or an acid addition salt thereof with a 4 halopyridine having the formulaEMI3.3 where X is chloro, bromo or iodo, or an acid addition salt or the N 4 pyridyl pyridinium halide hydrohalide of said 4 chloropyridine, wherein the halide is chloride, bromide or iodide. The halide used above is usually the chloride. In the process involving the reaction of the acid halide of compound of Formula II, IIA or IIB with ammonia or an amine H R , the reaction takes place readily in an inert solvent at ambient temperature. The acid halide can be formed from the free acid II, IIA or IIB by treatment with reagents known to convert carboxylic acids to acid halides, e.g. phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. Thionyl chloride is a preferred reagent. The intermediates of Formula II, IIA or IIB are in turn prepared by reacting 2 aminobenzoic acid or a derivative thereof EMI4.1 or corresponding 3 or 4 aminobenzoic acid with 4chloropyridine or an alkylated 4 chloropyridine or an acidaddition salt of said chloropyridines. The reaction takes place by heating the reactants in acetic acid medium at a temperature of about 100 1250C., conveniently at the boiling temperature of the acetic acid. The intermediate ofFormula II, IIA or IIB is obtained in the form of its hydrochloride salt. The latter can be readily converted to the free base with an alkaline substance such as sodium acetate.It is also possible to carry out the reaction between the aminobenzoic acid or derivative thereof with a 4 chloropyridine in an inert solvent at 100 1750C. in the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamineO In an alternative process the pyridinyl group is introduced as the last step by causing an intermediate ofFormula III, IIIA or IIIB to react with the compound ofFormula IV, or an acid addition salt thereof, according to the procedure described in the preceding paragraph. The intermediates of Formula III are in turn prepared by reaction of the appropriate amine H R with isatoic anhydride or a derivative thereof of the formula EMI5.1 Similarly, the intermediates of Formula IIIA orIIIB can be prepared by reacting the acid chloride of 3 or 4 aminobenzoic acid with ammonia or with piperidine.In place of the 4 halopyridine as a reagent for introducing the pyridinyl group it is possible to use the N 4 pyridinyl pyridinium halide hydrohalide in accordance with the general method described by Jerchel and Jakob, Chem. Ber.91, 1266 1959 . The reaction takes place by heating a compound of Formula III, IIIa or IIIb preferably in the form of an acid addition salt, with the N C4 pyridinyl pyridinium halide hydrohalide either alone or in an inert solvent such as sulfolane, dimethylsulfoxide, phenol or cellosolve at a temperature between about 1000C, and 2000C. Preferably the halide hydrohalide is the chloride hydrochloride. The compounds of Formula I wherein R is hydroxy are preferably prepared by demethylation of the compounds wherein Rt is methoxy. A preferred demethylation procedure comprises treating the methoxy compound with boron tribromide. The compounds of Formula I wherein R is bromo or nitro are prepared by conventional bromination or nitration, respectively, of the corresponding compounds of Formula I wherein R is hydrogen. Alternatively, the bromination or nitration can be carried out, if desired, at an intermediate stage of the synthesis, for example, on a compound ofFormula II or III or precursor thereof where R is hydrogen. The compounds of Formula I where R is Z NO2 S are preferably prepared by reacting a compound of Formula I where R is hydrogen first with chlorosulfonic acid and then with ammonia or an amine, Z NH. Alternatively, the aminosulfonyl group can be introduced at an intermediate stage, e.g., in a compound of Formula III where R is hydrogen. If compounds of Formula I where Rt is alkyl or 2 propenyl are desired, the R substituent can be introduced into a compound of Formula I, II or III where Rm is hydrogen by reaction with an alkyl halide or 2 propenyl halide in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride. The invention also contemplates pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula I.The nature of the acid addition salt is immaterial provided it is derived from an acid the anion of which is essentially innocuous to animal organisms. Examples of appropriate acid addition salts include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, methanesulfonate, maleate, citrate, tartrate, p toluenesulfonate, cyclohexanesulfamate, and the like. Although the compounds of Formula I theoretically possess two basic nitrogen atoms, the compounds tend to form only stable mono acid addition salts. Also contemplated are pharmaceutically acceptable quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds of Formula I, including those derived from lower alkyl halides, alkanesulfonates or arylsulfonates.

Evaluation of the compounds of the invention in laboratory animals has demonstrated that they possess antihypertensive activity. The primary screening test used involved oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats. The spontaneously hypertensive rat SHR is a genetically hypertensive strain developed from Wistar rats by Okamoto et al. Jap. Circ. J. 27 282 293 1963 by selective inbreeding. Unlike any other hypertensive animal model the SHR does not require any surgical intervention or chemical treatment, and it is widely recognized as a close model to essential hypertension in humans Folkow et al., Circ.Res. 32 Hypert. Suppl. XXI, I 2 I 16 1973 Pfeffer et al., ibid., I 28 I 38 1973 1. The methodology used was as follows Male spontaneous hypertensive rats SHR TaconicFarms weighing 300 350 g and with a systolic blood pressure of 160 220 mmHg were used. The rats were fasted for 18 hours prior to test agent administration. Each dose of each compound was tested in five SHR s whose blood pressure had been determined earlier that day Systolic blood pressure measurements at various times usually 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours after test agent administration were obtained with a photoelectric tensometer by the ankle rubber cuff method ofKersten et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. 32 1090 1098 1947 . Test agents were either solubilized or suspended in 1 gum tragacanth. The starting dose usually was 30 mg base acid kg administered orally in a volume of 1 ml kg. Further testing was done at 10, 3, 1, 0.3, etc. mg base acid kg in sequence. Testing is terminated when a dose is determined which does not cause an average reduction of 10 mmHg.Vehicle treated negative control , and known standard treated positive control animals were tested intermitten ly to monitor the stability and sensitivity of the assay. The effectiveness of a compound as an antihypertensive agent in the SHR is calculated in terms of the single oral dose mg kg which lowers systolic blood pressure by 40 mmHg at any time interval tested AHD40 . A further test procedure employed to evaluate the activity of the compounds of the invention entailed oral administration to conscious renal hypertensive dogs. The methodology used was as follows Young adult mongrel dogs of either sex weighing 9 18 kg were rendered hypertensive by bilateral renal encapsulation as described by Page, J.A.M.A. 113 2046 2048 1939 . Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored daily with a sphygmomanometer for 1 2 weeks prior to medication. The dogs were then dosed orally with the test compound for 3 5 consecutive days. Blood pressure was measured at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours after dosing and for 1 2 weeks after cessation of therapy. In several instances, the compounds of the invention were tested in the renal hypertensive dog in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, a well known diuretic and antihypertensive agent. The combination tended to produce a more uniform antihypertensive response, and in some cases the activity of the hydrochlorothiazide was potentiated even though the compound being tested showed no significant antihypertensive activity when administered alone. The following table gives the results of the testing on the compounds of the invention.

However, this is not indicative of inutility because there are several instances of clinically effective antihypertensive agents which are active in humans and in rats but not in dogs. The compound of Example 3 was active in the renal hypertensive dog when combined with hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg kg of each 20 55 mm fall in blood pressure. The compound of Example 32 was active in the renal hypertensive dog when combined with hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg kg of each 20 44 mm fall in blood pressure. The compound of Example 32 at a dose of 5.0 mg kg administered intravenously lowered blood pressure by 40 mm. The compound of Example l b , l 2 4 pyridinylamino benzoyl piperidine, is an especially preferred compound. This compound caused statistically significant dose related decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of anesthetized normotensive dogs from 0.3 to 10 mg kg, administered intravenously. It also caused a significant hypotensive effect and some reduction in heart rate in anesthetized cats when infused at dosages of 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg kg minute. The methiodide quaternary salt of 1 2 4pyridinylamino benzoyl piperidine when tested in the SHR caused a 23 mmHg reduction in blood pressure at 30 mg kg. The effects of 1 2 4 pyridinylamino benzoyl piperidine 2 mg kg in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg kg , administered orally to renal hypertensive dogs, were compared with the effects of either agent administered alone. The combination caused maximal reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 37 mmHg on the fourth day of treatment, with no effect on heart rate. The activity persisted for three days after withdrawal of treatment. The dogs appeared to respond more uniformly to the combination than to either agent alone. The peak effect of hydrochlorothiazide on diastolic blood pressure was significantly less than that achieved by the combination. The compounds of the invention can be prepared for use by conventional pharmaceutical procedures that is, by dissolving or suspending them in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, e.g., water, aqueous alcohol, glycol, oil solution or oil water emulsion, for parenteral or oral administration or by incorporating them in unit dosage form as capsules or tablets for oral administration either alone or in combination with conventional adjuvants or excipients, e.g., calcium carbonate, starch, lactose, talc, magnesium stearate, gum acacia, and the like.
