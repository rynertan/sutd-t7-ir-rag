# A process for preparing an aqueous emulsion or dispersion of a partly water soluble material and use of polymer particles prepared according to this process as a toner in xerography.

## Abstract
An aqueous emulsion or dispersion of a partly water soluble material is prepared in a two step process, a dispersion of polymer particles containing one or more materials having a very low solubility in water is prepared in the first step and a partly water soluble material is added in the second step which diffuses into the polymer particles obtained in the first step. Where the partly water soluble material is a polymerizable monomer, polymerization may be effected after diffusion of the monomer into the polymer particles.
