## Description
CSF INHIBITORY SUBSTANCE This invention relates to a substance inhibiting colony stimulating factor which is referred to as CSF inhibitory substance hereunder. The inventors of this invention found that on culturing a T3M 5 cell line CSF producing cells which had been established from human thyroid gland cancer cells at a high concentration the CSF activity was not proportional to its concentration, but was weaker than the expected level. They continued their study to seek the cause of the phenomenon and found the presence of a CSF inhibitory substance in the solution and isolated it to complete this invention. The CSF inhibitory substance isolated according to this invention has the following physicochemical characteristics.1 Molecular Weight 50,000 60,000 by gel filtration using Sephadex G 75 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , column size 10 mm diameter, 1,000 mm height, bed volume 78.5 ml, flow rate 4.0 ml hr, and eluent 0.01 M Tris HCl buffer solution con taining 0.15 M NaCI pH 7.4 . The standard curve was drawn on the basis of the volume of eluate with respect to the following proteins, and the molecular weight of the CSF inhibitory substance was determined based on the standard curve. protein molecular weight y globulin 160,000 albumin 66,000 ovalbumin 45,000 chymotrypsinogen A 25,700 cytochrome C 12,400 2 Isoelectric Point pH 4.7 The isoelectric point was determined by the flat bed isoelectric focusing method using Sephadex IEF PharmaciaFine Chemicals . The pH gradient in the bed from 2.5 to 5.0 was performed by electrophoresis with use of pharmalyte Pharmacia Fine Chemicals at 8 watts for 45 minutes and after applying the CSF inhibitory substance 144 mg to the bed, electrophoresed at 60 watts for 5 hours to determine the isoelectric point.3 pH Stability Stable at a pH of from 5 to 9. Inactivated at a pH lower than 3 or higher than 11. The CSF inhibitory substance was added to the buffer solutions of various pH, allowed to stand for 24 hours, and dialyzed against 0.01 M Tris HCl buffer solution pH 7 for one day, and then the CSF inhibitory activity was determined.4 Absorption in U.V. range Maximum absorption at 280 nm 5 Reactions with Enzymes Not inactivated with DNase 3.175 IU , RNase 76 IU or trypsin 0.2 Inactivated completely with pronase 5 IU Kaken Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan .6 Thermostability Stable at 370C and almost completely inactivated at 560C for 30 min. These characteristics of the substance of this invention differ in distribution, molecular weight, isoelectric point, etc., from those of several known substances inhibiting CSF, and this shows that the substance of this invention is novel. If fetal calf serum FCS which will be added to the culture medium used in the Example below is treated as in the Example, no substance of this invention is detected. This proves that the substance of this invention is not derived from serum. In addition to the above explained characteristics, the CSF inhibiting substance exhibits an activity which inhibits the colony formation of a K 562 cell line of human leukemic cells which is able to maintain their multiplication independent of the presence of CSF. This activity is observed at such a remarkably low concentration that normal cells are not adversely affected. Therefore, the substance is expected to be useful as an antileukemic agent.Example T3M 5 cells established from human thyroid gland cancer cells as CSF producing cells were suspended in a 10 FCS containing F 10 medium 500 ml in a count of 1.0 2.0 x 107. This cell line is preserved at Third Department ofInternal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo The Central Institute for Experimental Animals and TheLaboratories of Chugai Seiyaku Kabushiki Kaisha. The suspension was cultured in a roller bottle at 0.5 rpm. at 370C for one week. The supernatants of broth cultures similarly cultured in 20 bottles were combined to give a total amount of about 10R. After concentration thereof, the combined supernatants was subjected to a gel filtration with Sephadex G 75 which had been equilibrated with 0.01 M Tris HCl buffer solution containing 0.15 M NaCl pH 7.4 and 0.01 Tween 20 and fractions containing a substance with 50,000 60,000 molecular weight were collected. The fractions were applied to and absorbed on DEAESepharose CL 6B, and eluted with a buffer solution stepwisely increasing the concentration of NaCl, i.e. 0.04 M, 0.08 M and 0.15 M. Then, the eluate with a 0.1 M citric acid buffer solution containing 0.5 M NaCl were collected as CSF inhibiting substance containing fractions. After concentration with PM 10 the volume of the fractions containing CSF inhibiting substance was 7 ml which contained 1,000 mg of protein. In the colony assay method using mouse bone marrow derived cells in the presence of a sufficient amount of CSF, the addition of about 1,200 pg of the protein exhibited 90 inhibition. In contrast, 90 inhibition was observed at about 120 pg of the protein when human bone marrow derived cells were cultivated.
