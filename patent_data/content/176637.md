# Medium for plant protoplast culture.

## Abstract
A culture medium and method for the isolation and culture of plant protoplasts is disclosed which includes in it a quantity of neutral mammalian blood serum. An addition of 1 to 25 serum to protoplast media results in a greater yield of viable protoplast cells, helps to protect the protoplasts in culture, and makes it possiible to obtain and maintain corn protoplasts, a heretofore difficult task.
