# Disk storage apparatus.

## Abstract
A disk drive includes a housing 50 substantially symmetrical about a central neutral plane C and support ing bearings 22 and 24 for a spindle 20 supporting a hub 18 for a stack of magnetic disks 16 . The plane C is normal to the spindle axis. Voice coil motor actuators are disposed diametrically opposite each other relative to the spindle axis and offset on each side of the plane C , which bisects the stack. The drive is enclosed within a cas ing having cover plate and cover box to which filtered air under pressure is supplied. A bypass port 60 prevents air passing through bearing 22 when rotation of the disks reduces air pressure within the housing 50 . A sealing cap 64 seals off the bearing 24 . This reduces contamination by lubricant in the bearings, which would be collected by air passing therethrough. Thermally conductive rings be tween the bearings and the housing compensate for tem perature differential. Symmetry of the assembly ensures minimal vibration and resonance effects.
