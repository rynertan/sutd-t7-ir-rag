# Postage meter apparatus having microprocessor controlled D.C. motor for controlling a postage meter and process for use in the same.

## Abstract
A postage meter 10 which includes a plurality of loads, a d.c. motor 120 for supply of motive power for driving the respective loads and instrumentalities 470 for selectively coupling the source of motive power to the respective loads, further comprises a d.c. motor output shaft 122 adapted to be selectively coupled to the respective loads means 126 for sensing angular displacement of the motor output shaft 122 computer means 500 comprising a clock for generat ing successive sampling time periods, means for providing first counts respectively representative of successive desired angular displacements of the motor output shaft during successive sampling time periods, means responsive to the sensing means for providing second counts respectively representative of actual angular displacements of the motor output shaft 122 during successive sampling time periods, and means for compensating for the difference between the first and second counts during each successive sampling time period and generating a pulse width modulated control signal for controlling the d.c. motor 120 , the motor control signal causing the actual angular displacement of the motor output shaft 122 to substantially match the desired angular displacement of the motor output shaft 122 during succes sive sampling time periods and a signal amplifier circuit 300 for operably coupling the motor control signal to the d.c. motor 120 .
