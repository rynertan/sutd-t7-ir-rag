# Improved method of producing ethanol water azeotrope from crude ethanol.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for purifying crude ethanol, whether produced by fermentation or by the synthetic route, to produce a pure ethanol water azeotrope. The process uses only two distillation columns for fermenta tion ethanol or synthetic ethanol eventhough the latter has diethyl ether as impurity. The inventive concept lies in the design and specification of the columns and the specific high pressure and low reflux ratio distillation conditions which enable each of the impurities in ethanol to be reduced below ppm. Ethanol of such purity is most desirable when used for potable or pharmaceutical purposes.
