# Scroll type fluid compressor units.

## Abstract
A scroll type refrigerant compressor unit has a drive shaft 17 supported in a front end plate 11 of a housing by a single radial bearing 16 , and a disk rotor 21 having a drive pin 23 to effect orbital motion of an orbiting scroll member 24 is fixedly mounted on an inner end of the drive shaft and is supported on the front end plate by a thrust bearing 22 . The orbiting scroll member 24 has an axial boss 243 which is rotatably mounted on the drive pin by means of a second radial bearing 26 and a radial flange 271 which is supported by a second thrust bearing 28 on the rear surface of the disk rotor. The unit is assembled by inserting parts into the compressor hous ing in a predetermined order and by finally securing a front end plate onto the compressor housing by bolts, whereby the production of the compressor unit is simplified. The drive shaft, and, therefore, the compressor unit are made of reduced length and deflection and vibrations of the drive shaft are securely prevented. A lubricating system is pro vided to lubricate a shaft seal assembly on the drive shaft, whereby the oil in the compressor housing is directed to the shaft seal cavity 181 and returns to the interior of the compressor housing after lubricating the radial and thrust bearings and other parts. A mechanism for automatically reducing the compressed fluid amount at an increased high speed operation of the compressor unit is provided.
