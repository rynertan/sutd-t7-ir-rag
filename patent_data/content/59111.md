# PHOTOIONIZER

## Abstract
There is provided a photoionizer which includes a light source 11 comprising a hollow torus 13 , an ultraviolet transmitting window 15 substantially surrounding a pas sage 23 through the torus, a gas filling 17 within the torus, and means 100, 25 for creating an electrical dis charge within said torus. The photoionizer further includes an electrode means 25, 27 within said passage through said torus for collecting, or extracting, the ions produced by light from the light source impinging on a gas within said passage, means for passing a preselected gas sample through said passage containing said electrode means, and means connected to said electrode means for measuring the ions collected by said electrode means resulting from the interaction between the light from said light source 11 and said gas sample or extracting means 33 able to project a beam of ions from the ionization region or from an ion image outside the ionization region.
