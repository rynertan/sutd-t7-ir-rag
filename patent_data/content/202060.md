## Description
SILICATE MOLLIFIED EPDM CATALYST SYSTEM AND PROCESS Useful polymers of ethylene and propylene include the terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with a non conjugated diene. These polymers which have incorporated therein a site of pendant unsaturation are commonly known as EPDM polymers. They have wide utility because, unlike the ethylene propylene copolymers EP the EPDX polymers can be sulfur crossed linked. This characteristic is attributable to the presence of unsaturation which is lacking in the EP polymers. While unsaturation is a desirable property in the EPDM from the standpoint of utility it is the source of problems during polymerization. An idealized EPDfl polymer Es devoid of any branching other than the moomeric moieties attached to the EP backbone chain as sites of pendant unsaturation. In practice, however, these sites of unsaturation are points of initiation for branching as a result of chain coupling. While a wide range of chemical reactions can result in branching, it is especially likely when the residual olefin of the pendant group is capable of forming a tertiary carbonium ion and the Ziegler catalyst system employed to produce the polymer has considerableLewis acid character. The branching is believed to be catalyzed by cationic species arising from the Ziegler catalyst. Olefin functionality that can form a secondary carbonium ion is also believed to be susceptible to branching in the presence of acidic catalyst, as well as olefin structures which can rearrange to tertiary or secondary ions.Consequently, for residual olefin functionality in the polymer of the generalized structure EMI2.1 where n 0 m O R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 hydrogen, alkyl, cyclic or aromatic groups cationically catalyzed branching can be expected as long as n and m are not both zero when R1 and R4 are both Sy drogen. Examples of the diene monomers that tend to form branched structures with acidic Ziegler catalysts are as follows dicyclopentadiene 5 methylene 2 norbornene 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene tetrahydroindene methyl tetrahydroindene 5 isopropenyl 2 norbornene 5 2 butenyl 2 norbornene 5 methallyl 2 norbornene 5 isopropylidene 2 norbornene 2 methyl norbornadiene Excessive branching yields polymers with undesirably high bulk viscosity. Additionally, the corresponding vulcanizates have inferior physical properties.Furthermore, branching can also lead to unstable reactor operations during polymerization resulting in undesirable product quality variability. The Ziegler catalyst systems employed to produce ethylene copolymers and terpolymers generally com prise a vanadium compound catalyst z and an aluminum com pound cocatalyst. The preferred vanadium compounds of the prior art include halides, oxyhalides, and vanadates including dihalovanadates. British patent no.1132,662 discloses a suitable EP catalyst which utilizes a vanadium compound of the formula VX4 or VOX3 wherein X is halogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl or alkoxy. The vanadium compound is utilized in conjunction with a cocatalyst prepared by reacting an aluminum sesquihalide with an organic hydroxy compound. British patent no. 1,275,641 discloses a catalyst system for the preparation of polymers and copolymers of olefins which comprises a titanium or vanadium compound which can be a halide oxyhalide or haloalkoxy compound of vanadium or titanium. The cocatalyst is a compound of the formula Xm nM OR n, wherein X is a monovalent inorganic radical, R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical, M is a metal belonging to Groups Ia, Ila, IIb, Ilib and Villa of the PeriodicTable or boron, m is the valence of M and n is an integer such that 1 n m. U.S. patent nc. 3,288,768 discloses the catalyst system for the production of copolymers of alphaolefins which comprises 1 a vanadium chloride or oxychloride, 2 an alkyl aluminum dihalide and 3 a dialkyl aluminum alkoxide. U.S. patent no 3,597,367 discloses a catalyst system for the preparation of alpha olefin copolymers comprising a vanadium oxychloride or a vanadium halo alkoxy, an aluminum borohydride and a Lewis acid. U.S. patent no. 3,567,653 discloses a catalyst useful for the copolymerization of ethylene and higher alpha olefine comprising an alkyl aluminum and the reaction product of a vanadium compound and an alkyl titanate. The vanadium compound can be VOC13 or an alkylvanadate. U.S. patent 3,780,005 discloses a similar catalyst wherein the catalyst is tha reaction product of a vanadium oxychloride or tetrachioride with an aluminum alkoxide. U.S. patent no. 3,048,574 discloses the preparation of an alpha olefin polymerizatîon catalyst by reacting a Group I VII compound with an organoxysilane, U.S. patent no. 3,271,37 discloses a catalyst system for the preparation of the reaction products of vanadium oxytrichloride or vanadium tetrachloride, an alkyl aluminum dihalide, and an alkoxy silane. None of these prior art catalyst systems can taining alkoxides are directed toward producing EPDM with reduced branching. It is known to reduce branching during ethylene terpolymer polymerization by the addition of aLewis base, e.g. NH3, to the polymerization medium.While the Lewis base is effective to reduce branching it, too, reduces catalyst reactivity and efficiency.What is needed is a method for effectively eliminating branching during the preparation of ethylenelalpha. olefin non conjugated diolefin terpolymers while at the same time not otherwise changing the characteristics of the catalyst system being used. It has been surprisingly found that alkoxy silanes can be used as catalyst system modifiers to substantially reduce branching during ethylene terpolymer EPDM polymerization. Branching is suppressed without any effect on catalyst efficiency or reactivity. The catalyst used in EPDM polymerization is generally a vanadium halide or vanadium oxychloride. A cocatalyst is generally an alkyl aluminum halide, e.g., aluminum sesquihalide or dialkyl aluminum halide. The alkoxy silanes suitable for use as catalyst modifiers in the practice of this invention have the general formula Si OR xLy wherein x is 3 or 4, y 4 x, R is a hydrocarbyl moiety and L is halogen, hydrogen or R. The amount of silicate required to effectively suppress branching will vary depending on polymerization conditions and catalyst system utilized. The mole ratio of silicate to aluminum is preferably about 0.02 to about 0.5 moles mole. This invention relates to an improved process for the polymerization of EPDX polymers which are substantially free of branching. In particular it relates to a catalyst system modifier to suppress branching which comprises an alkoxy silane of the general formula Si OR xLy wherein L is halogen, hydrogen or R R is hydrocarbyl group, x is 3 or 4 and y 4 4 x. Preferably R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl or aromatic moiety. More preferably R is C1 C8 alkyl C6 Clo cycloalkyl, or a C6 C12 aromatic moiety.

Of the non conjugated dienes typically used to prepare EPDM terpolymers the preferred dienes are dicyclopentadiene, 1 ,4 hexadiene, 5 methyl 2 norbornene and 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene. Particularly preferred diolefins are 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene ENB and 1,4 hexadiene EPDM elastomers and their general method of manufacture are well known in the art. The preferredEPDM elastomers contain about 20 to about 90 weight percent ethylene, more preferably about 30 to 80 weight percent ethylene, most preferably about 35 to about 75 weight percent ethylene. The alpha olefins suitable for use in the preparation of EPDM are preferably C3 C16 alpha olefins. Illustrative non limiting examples of of such alphaolefins are propylene, 1 butene, 1 pentene, 1 hexene, l octene and l dodecene. The alpha olefin is generally incorporated into the EPDM polymer at about 10 to about 80 weight percent, more preferably at about 20 to about 70 height per cent. The non conjugated diene is preferably incorporated into the EPDM at about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent more preferably about 1 to about 10 weight percent, e.g., 5 weight percent. In carrying out the process of this invention the preferred catalysts are vanadium compounds with a vanadium valence of at least 3, and which are soluble in the polymerization diluent more preferably the catalysts are VX4 or an oxyvanadium compound of the general formula VOXn OR 3 n where n is an interge of 2 or 3,R is a hydrocarbyl radical and X is halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine. Preferably R is C1 C10 alkyl, phenyl or benzyl, more preferably R is C1 C4 alkyl, e.g., methyl. ethyl or butyl.The cocatalyst utilized to prepare the active catalyst species is an aluminum compound such as A12R 3X 3 alkylaluminum sesquihalides or AlR bX 3 b, wherein R is a hydrocarbyl moiety, Xl is halogen and b is 1 to 2. While the halogen can be chlorine, bromine or iodine, the preferred halogen is chlorine. The hydrocarbyl moiety can be eg C1 C20 alkyl1 cycloalkyl or aromatic group. Pref erably R is C1 C10 aikyl or cycloalkyl, phenyl or benzyl. Most preferably R is C1 C6 alkyl. Illustrative, non limiting examples of R are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso butyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl or mixtures thereof.In its preferred embodiment the aluminum compound is a dialkyl aluminum halide or alkyl aluminum sesquihalide. More preferably the aluminum compound is diethyl aluminum chloride DEAC or ethyl aluminum sesquichloride EASC . While a wide range of diluents are known to be suitable for EPDM polymerization, the diluent is preferably an organic compound which is a solvent for the monomers and polymers as well as the vanadium compound.In utilizing the catalyst system of this invention the vanadum ,compound and aluminum compound can be utilized at a Al V mole ratio of eg 1 to about 40, preferably about 2 to about 20, more preferably about 3 to about 10, e.g., 5 to about 10. The polymerization reaction can be conducted at a gage pressure of eg 0 Kpa to about 3000 Xpa and at any temperature suitable for Ziegler polymerization reactions. The preferred pressure range for carrying out the EPDM polymerization is about 100 to about 1500 Kpa, more preferably about 300 to about 1000 Kpa. The polymerization is preferably carried out at about 20 degrees C to about 150 degrees C, more preferably about 10 degrees C to about 100 degrees C, most preferably about 15 degrees C to about 60 degrees C. It is within the scope of this invention to incorporate hydrogen as a feed stream to moderate polymer molecular weight. The hydrogen is added at about 0 to about 30 mole percent based on the total monomer. The silicates of this invention can be utilized at lower concentration than the prior art branching suppressors and have the added advantage of allowing the use of less aluminum compound cocatalyst.The particular amount of silicate required to suppress branching will depend on the nature of the silicate, the diolefino the catalyst system, the Al V ratio and the polymerization conditions. Generally eg 0.02 to 0.5 moles of silicate to moles of aluminum can be used preferably about 0.04 to 0.3 mol mol are used. The efficacious amount of silicate needed for a given set of polymerization conditions can readily be determined by experiments using the technique described in the exams pies, infra. Increasing amounts of silicate compound are added to the polmerization reactor and the degree of long chain branching in the polymer is measured. The silicate concentration that just reduces branching to a minimum is the optimurn amount.The use of excessive amounts of silicates will result in reduced catalyst activity. The silicate concentration can also be expressed in terms of Si V mole ratio and can w y eg from about 0.1 to about 3.0 preferably about 0.3 to about 2.0 more preferably about 0.6 to about 1.3, e.g. about 0.4 to about 1.0. The vanadium and aluminum compounds can be added to the reactor either separately or premixed with one another. However, it is preferred that the silicate be added to the reactor separately and not in combina tion with any of the catalyst components. The advantages of the instant invention may be more readily appreciated by reference to the following examples. In the examples the polymerization was carried out in a liquid filled, continuous, stirred tank polymerization reactor. Reactor residence time was 13 minutes and polymerization temperature was 32 degrees C unless otherwise specified. Ethylene, propylene and 5 ethylidene 2norbornene ERK were fed to the reactor in a hexane solution. Conventional precautions were taken to purify all reactor feed streams so that air, moisture, and other catalyst poisons did not enter the reactor in significant amounts. Catalyst, cocatalyst and silicate were pumped into the reactor as dilute solutions in hexane. Hydrogen was fed as a gas to control polymer molecular weight. At the exit of the reactor the polymerization was quenched by mixing water with the polymer solution.Polymer was recovered by adding the solution to a tank of hot water sparged with steam to strip off the solvent and unreacted monomers. The wet polymer was then dried on a hot rubber mill. Polymerization rate was determined by weighing the amount of rubber obtained in a fixed time period.Monomer conversion and catalyst efficiency weight of polymer product wt. vanadium catalyst fed were determined to characterize the catalyst activity. Infrared analysis ASZM D3900 was used to measure polymer ethylene content while refractive index I.J. Gardner E G. Ver Strate, Rubber Chem Tech, 46, 1019 1973 was used for ENB content. Polymer Mooney viscosity was measured by ASTM D1646. Molecular weight number average, Mn weight average, M z average, Mz and molecular weight distribution lD, were measured using a Waters 150 gel permeation chromatograph equipped with a Chromatix KlW 6 on line light scattering photometer. The system is used at 135 degrees C with 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene as the mobile phase. Showadex Showa Denko America, Inc. polystyrene gel columns 802, 803 804 and 805 were used.The technique utilized is described in Liquid Chromatography of Polymers and Related Materials III, J.Cazes, editor, Marcel Dekker, 1981, p. 257, incorporated herein by reference. No corrections for column spreading are employed however, data on generally accepted standards, e.g., National Bureau of Standards Polyethylene 1484 and anionically produced bydroqenated polyisoprene demonstrate that such corrections on Mw Mn or Mz Mw are less than 0.05 units. Mw Mn was calculated from an elution time molecular weight relationship whereas .1z Mw is evaluated using the light scattering photometer. The MW Mn are used as an indication of MWD breadth the larger the value, the broader the MWD . The degree of branching in the EPDM was ascertained by measuring the solubility of non crystalline terpolymer samples. Polymers with no or low amounts of branching will dissolve completely in hexane at 25 degree C. When extensive branching has taken place, some fraction of the polymer is usually branched beyond the gel point and swells but does not dissolve in the solvent. The quantity of the gel fraction is taken to indicate the relative amount of long chain branching. To measure the quantity of gel, about 2 grams of polymer was placed in a jar containing about 250 ml of n hexane and allowed to stand for two weeks at ambient temperature with occasional gentle swirling during that period. Undissolved polymer was recovered by decanting the jar contents into a tared 350 mesh stainless steel screen which was then placed in a vacuum oven held at 60 degrees C. After 12 hours of drying to evaporate the solvent the screen was reweighed to determine the amount of undissolved polymer. rne ratio of the weight of undissolved polymer to original polymer charge is the fraction of gel. In the following examples polynerization was started with no or low feed of silicate compound to the reactor. After providing sufficient time to achieve steady state, a polymer sample was collected for analysis and the polymerization rate measured. The flow rate of silicate was then initiated or increased, and the reactor again allowed to reach steady state. A second polymer sample was obtained for analysis. This procedure was followed for several different levels of silicate feed rate. All other polymerization conditions were held constant for an experiment. The polymerization data is shown in Table I.EXAMPLE 1 A control polymerization using the conditions shown in Table I was carried out using VOC13 ethyl aluminum sesquichloride EASC as the catalyst system.No silicate was added. The polymer contained 19Z gel.Because of the large amount of insoluble fraction, molecular weight distribution could not be measured accurately by GPC analysis. Polymerization data are shown in Table II.EXAMPLE 2 Example 1 was repeated but ethyl silicate Si OEt 4 was added to the reactor. As seen from TableII the Mooney viscosity of the polymer dropped as the silicate feed rate was increased. At Si V ratio of 0.75, gel content was 5Z as compared to 19X for the control. Catalyst efficiency and propylene conversion are slightly reduced relative to the control. Raising theSi V ratio from 0.75 to 1.0 has a deleterious effect on catalyst activity without significantly reducing branching further.EXAMPLE 3 Example 1 was repeated except that methyl silicate Si OMe 4 was added to the reactor. As the silicate level was increased the polymer molecular weight dropped and the MWD breadth narrowed, as shown by the Mw Mn ratio, indicating that branching was being eliminated. At an Si V ratio of 1.0 the amount of gel was reduced to 3Z without significant loss in catalyst activity relative to the control of Example 1. SeeTable II.EXAMPLE 4 A control experiment using the conditions shown in Stable III was run carrying out the polymerization using VCl4 ethyl aluminum sesquichloride as the catalyst system in the absence of silicate. The gel content of the polymer was 46Z and the Mooney was quite high Ca 100 . The results are shown in Table II.EXAMPLES 5 8 Example 4 was repeated varying the quantity and type of silicate used as the chain branching suppressor. In all cases at ratios of 0.5 to 1 mole Si mole V gave polymers of narrow MWD with gel content of less than 2 wt Z. As shown in Table II at these silicate levels the detrimental effect on catalyst activity was minimal.EXAMPLE 9 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated with ethyl aluminum dichloride as cocatalyst and VOCl3 as the catalyst. Reactor temperature was 30 C and residence time was 13 minutes. Feed rates were as follows ethylene 2.53g lOOg hexane propylene 12.OgllOOg hexane VOC13 .0067g1100g hexaneIn the initial run, at an A1 V ratio of 10 and an NB feed of O.lSg lOOg hexane, a polymer containing about 4 wt ENB was produced. However, severe gellation occurred in the reactor leading to an extremely viscous polymer solution. Reactor operation was unsteady and no polymerization data could be obtained. S4B feed rate was halved, giving an improvement in reactor operability and producing a polymer with 2.3 wtZ ENB. This polymer contained 28I gel see Table II .Si OEt 4 was then fed to the reactor and the A1 V ratio was reduced to 6. As shown in Table II, , the addition of Si OEt 4 lowered polymer Mooney viscosity, narrowed MWD, and at a Si V ratio of 0.5 mol mol reduced the gel content to 4.7X. Surprisingly, the use of Si OEt 4 also led to improved catalyst efficiency and propylene conversion.EXAMPLE 10 A comparison experiment was run to demonstrate the effectiveness of silicates as branching suppressors as compared with the prior art branching suppressor, ammonia, a Lewis base. The polymerization was carried out with VOC13 ethyl aluminum sesquichloride EASC catalyst system using ammonia in one instance Case A andSi OEt 4 in the other Case B . The details of the polymerization and polymer characterization are shown inTable IV. The experiments were run identically except that in Case B the propylene feed was decreased to compensate for the higher reactivity of propylene when Si OEt 4 is used as the branching suppressor.Also, theA1 V ratio was reduced from 6 to 5 with the addition of Si OEt ,. The polymers produced were essentially identical but the use of Si OEt 4 instead of NH3 resulted in a 20 irprovement in propylene conversion.EXAMPLE 11 That the silicates of this invention have only a minor effect on polym.erization catalyst efficiency or activity was demonstrated by carrying out an ethylenepropylene copolymerization in the absence of ENB with increasing levels of Si OEt 4. As shown in Table V, incremental additions of silicate up to 0.5 Si V do not significantly disturb any of the catalyst activity or propylene conversion.
