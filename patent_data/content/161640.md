# ENCAPSULATED MOUSE CELLS TRANSFORMED WITH AVIAN RETROVIRUS BOVINE GROWTH HORMONE DNA, AND A METHOD OF ADMINISTERING BGH IN VIVO

## Abstract
Recombinant DNA constructs having an avian retroviral long terminal repeat LTR ligated to the bovine growth hor mone gene, were co transformed into a mammalian cell mouse culture in order to obtain a stable cell culture se creting large amounts of bovine growth hormone. The trans formed mouse cells were encapsulated in hollow fibers and implanted into animals, thereby producing circulating bo vine growth hormone.
