# Method and apparatus for discriminating platelets from red blood cells in a blood sample.

## Abstract
A diluted whole blood sample is hydrodynamically focused to a given point. A light beam is transversely focused on the same point and the principles of dark field microscopy are utilized, detecting scattered light and thereby discriminating platelets from red blood cells based on cell volume and refractivity.
