# Composites utilizing fillers of surface modified hollow microspheres.

## Abstract
Polymers that are stable under aqueous conditions of high ionic strength are combined with non fused, silicate based microspheres that are modified with multivalent metals but not washed or dried, said microspheres being present as filters.
