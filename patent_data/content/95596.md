# Process and apparatus for continuous slurry casting.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus 10 is described for slurry casting an ingot having a non dendritic structure across substantially its entire cross section. The casting mold 12 has a first chamber for extracting heat from the molten material. The amount of heat extracted from the molten material and the cooling rate of the molten material is controlled to initiate growth of primary phase particles and to form a semi solid slurry having a desired fraction solid. The mold also has a second chamber for casting the slurry into an ingot. Adjacent the exit portion of the first chamber and the inlet portion of the second chamber, a transition member is provided for delivering the slurry to the casting chamber and for preventing the ingot shell from extending back into the first chamber.
