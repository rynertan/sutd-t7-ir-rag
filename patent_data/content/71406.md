# Tube mooring line.

## Abstract
A tie line in the form of a mooring line comprising a tube 10 of elastomeric material 14 reinforced with coaxial layers 16, 17 of helically wound relatively inelastic filaments. Adjacent pairs of layers 16, 17 are spaced apart by the elastomeric material 14 and their filaments 18 are wound in oppositely handed helices. The tube 10 contains a pressu rized fluid which supplements the elastic properties of the tube 10 in resisting an axial load on the tube 10. The mooring line may be used to moor a buoyant wave energy device, and may be combined with a turbine 60 to form an electric power system.
