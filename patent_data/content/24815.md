# Background light intensity compensation method and circuit for a line scan camera system.

## Abstract
In an optical mark reader for automatically scoring from documents, a line scan camera system is employed to extract information from marks or characters on each document a memory circuit is used to store the average white and black video output from the camera so that a given white to black transition can be compared to stored adaptive white and black reference levels to compensate for variations in document background light intensity and aberrations associated with the lens of the line scan camera system. Each scan line is divided into a predetermined number of segments, so that said storing and comparing are effected on a segment by segment basis.
