# PREPARATION OF LIGNOCELLULOSIC ISOCYANATE MOLDED COMPOSITIONS USING A FUNCTIONAL POLYSILOXANE ISOCYANATE COPOLYMER RELEASE AGENT

## Abstract
In the compression molding of lignocellulosic composite articles, such as particle or flake board, in which polyisocyan ate binder systems are employed, a copolymeric reaction product of a hydroxy or carboxy containing polysiloxane and an isocyanate is provided as release agent on the mold surfaces to give multiple release. Optionally organopolysilo xane fluid may be employed along with the copolymer as a diluent.
