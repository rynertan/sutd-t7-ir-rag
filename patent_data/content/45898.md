# DUAL WAVELENGTH PHOTOMETER WITH MEANS FOR VARYING LIGHT SIGNAL WAVELENGTHS

## Abstract
An automated photometer is provided having a monochromator which generates light signals at least two controllable wavelength, for use in a dual wavelength analyzer system. Chopped light is alternately directed from two entrance slits 57 displaced from each other onto a fixed grating 60, thereby providing an alternating light source having light pulses at two defined wavelengths. The light signal is passed through one or more cuvettes 92A, 92B each containing a sample, and a photodetector 93A, 93B on the other side of the cuvette generates a periodic electrical signal representative of the absorbance of the test sample at the two defined wavelengths. An electronic processing channel 1, 2 is provided for each cuvette, adapted to process the periodic electrical signal which contains information derived at the two wavelengths and to provide output signals representative of the two absorbance values.
