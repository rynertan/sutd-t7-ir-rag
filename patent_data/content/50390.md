# Flexible tube for conveying a mixture of a liquid and a solid material.

## Abstract
A flexible tube for conveying a mixture of a liquid and a solid material containing objects with sharp points, edges or similar projections, the internal wall part of said tube consisting of an elastic material 1 , especially rubber, in which a wearproof material is present in the shape of rod shaped elements 2 which are provided essentially parallel and at a distance from one another in said internal wall part 1 in such a way that they extend themselves between the inner and the outer surface of said internal wall part 1 , the shortest dis tance between the most closely spaced wall parts of said elements 2 being at least equal to the greatest dimension D of the rod shaped elements 2 as seen in the radial direction of said elements 2 .
