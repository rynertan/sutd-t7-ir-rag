# Method for analyzing stored image details.

## Abstract
A method for analyzing stored image details for identifi cation purposes is disclosed in which slopes are abstracted from an image to provide three dimensional recognition information. Data representing light levels of an image are stored in a picture memory device, which is analyzed in a predetermined manner to select absolute illumination mag nitudes between fixed locations of the image. This informa tion is directly related to the slope between the locations. Steeper slopes and their corresponding locations are stored as recognition data in a learn mode. In an access mode, the previously obtained information is utilized to locate new data, and depending upon the degree of correlation therebe tween, an indication of recognition is either verified or rejected.
