# Apparatus for treating mixtures of liquid and gas.

## Abstract
Apparatus for treating gas liquid mixtures comprising a housing 3 surrounding a vertical tubular wall 5 defining an inner space 6 and an outer space 7. Swirl imparting means 10 are provided for imparting a rotary motion to a gas liquid mixture in said inner space to separate the liquid and the gas. A primary gas outlet tube 12 and liquid discharge openings 11 are provided for discharging separated gas and liquid respec tively, from the inner space 6, into the outer space while entrained gas can escape from the outer space 7 via a secon dary gas outlet tube 13. For further removal of liquid from the separated gas a layer of flow impinging means 15 is so arranged with respect to the gas outlet tubes 12 and 13 that entrained liquid can be removed from the gas while the layer is substantially only loaded with gas from the secondary gas outlet tube 13.
