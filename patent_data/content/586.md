# Method for rejuvenating ion sources.

## Abstract
Ion sources which become coated with insulative materials are rejuvenated by forming the repeller electrode 46 in the ion source of gold 50 and bombarding such repeller electrode with ions to sputter the gold onto the coated surfaces 49 to render them conductive again. Gold sputtering is accomplished by bombarding the gold repeller electrode 46 with inert argon ions. To perform this method, the slit of the extractor plate 52,53 in the ion source is greatly reduced in cross sectional area 51 such that the normally higher sputtering pressures may be maintained within the ion source itself. If a direct sample probe is used, it too may be formed of gold and used to provide the gold sputtering source.
