# Improvements in or relating to windows.

## Abstract
In order to achieve dissipation of heat from large areas of glazing in buildings in which solar radiation is directly incident, there are provided opposed glazing members as in an extruded panel 5 through which a heat exchange liquid flows in a closed circuit to dissipate its heat at a location remote from the window. The heat exchange liquid is col oured in such manner as to allow solar radiation incident on the front glazing member to pass through the heat exchange liquid so that its infrared component is at least partially absorbed and the colourings of the heat exchange liquid and of the glazing members are such that light is able to pass therethrough into the room provided with the glazing.
