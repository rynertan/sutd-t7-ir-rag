# A METHOD FOR COMBATTING BLACKGRASS IN CEREAL CROPS AND COMPOSITIONS THEREFOR

## Abstract
A method for obtaining satisfactory weed control includ ing control of blackgrass in cereal crops comprising pre emergent application of a mixture of terbutryne and triflura lin having a ratio of 1 2 to 2.5 1 and compositions for same, particularly liquid concentrate compositions which do not give crystalline precipitation within 24 hours of emulsifica tion, comprising a 7.5 to 18 terbutryne, b 15 to 25 triflu ralin, c 28 to 42 non phytoxic alicyclic ketone, d 5 to 15 emulsifier, and e stabilizing cosolvent selected from 1 1 to 3 mesityl oxide, or 2 8 to 15 lower alkyl esters of C 18 unsaturated fatty acids, or 3 a combination of 10 to 20 iso phorone and 1 to 3 di lower alkyl formamide.
