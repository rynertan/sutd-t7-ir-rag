# POWER SUPPLIES USING MOSFET DEVICES

## Abstract
A power supply for driving multi electrode semiconduc tor power devices such as field effect transistors FETs including an integrated circuit module providing control signals which are coupled to the primary winding of a transformer which has two secondary windings. Each secon dary winding is coupled to a drive circuit which is coupled to an FET. The FETs provide output voltages across an output transformer. Each drive circuit includes series connected NPN and PNP transistors, each having a capacitor in its current flow circuit so that, as each transistor turns on, current flows from the capacitor into the FET to turn it on, the capacitor being recharged as the FET conducts. The com bination of the transistors and capacitor acts like a power supply for the FET.
