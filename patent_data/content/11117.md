## Description
PHOSPHONITRILIC Cl lLOIDE PLEIONOtERS This invention relates to the preparation of liquid, linear phosphonitrilic chloride pleionomers having a number average molecular weight of at least about 1450. More specifically, this invention relates to a process for producing linear phosphonitrilic chloride pleionomers in relatively short time in which the pleionomer product is a viscous, light orange or yellow oil soluble in toluene and chloroform. Phosphonitrilic chlorides are well known materials and are generally distinguished as cyclic trimer, tetramer, pentamer, etc. or linear.Representative art relating to the preparation and reaction of cyclic PNC12 n polymers includes U. S.3,359,080 U. S. 3,367,750 U. S. 3,462,247 andU. S. 3,780,162. Linear phosphonitrilic chlorides may be further classified as oligomers, pleionomers or polymers depending on their molecular weight. According toThe Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology,Vol. 9, 485 1968 , oligomers have a molecular weight up to about 1,000, pleionomers have a molecular weight in the range of from about 1,000 to about 10,000 and polymers have a molecular weight above 10,000. Prior art relating to linear phosphonitrilic chloride oligomers, pleionomers and polymers include Paddock et al, Advances in Organic Chemistry and Radiochemistry,Vol. I, New York, Academic Press 1959 , pp. 351 353, 359 6Q1, wherein the reaction of NH4C1 with PCl5 and products therefrom are discussed. U.S. 3,545,942 patented December 8, 1970 discloses a method of thermally stabilizing linear phosphonitrilic chloride oligomers by heating at 2400 260OC. for 2 to 8 hours. Methods for preparing linear phosphonitrilic chloride pleionomers from linear oligomers have been disclosed in the art. For example, U.

However, this process ir. volves heating for long periods of time, the endpoint of the polymerization occurring about 40 to 60 hours after heating has been initiated. The product obtained via this process is reported to be a dark orange viscous oil. See also James M. Maselli, Thomas Bieniek andRip G. Rice W. R.Grace and Company , PhosphonitrilicLaminating Resins, Air Force Materials Laboratory,Technical Report AFML 65 314 Wright Patterson AirForce Base, Ohio June, 1965, page 18 which describes this same process. At page 47 of this report Maselli et al describe an experiment wherein oligomeric phosphonitrilic chloride was placed in a resin kettle fitted with a nitrogen inlet, stirrer and exhaust tube concenser. The resin kettle was heated to 2500 t 10 C. for a total of 55 hours while the oligomeric PNCl2 n was stirred under a blanket of dry nitrogen. Samples of the reaction material were taken at selected intervals of time during the heating for molecular weight determination. The resulting data were as follows MOLECULAR WEIGHT hours VPO Start 700 10 1200 40 3200 55 6900 According to the authors, when the heating was continued for an additional 8 hours at temperatures in excess of 250 C., the viscous, soluble oil m. wt. 6900 was converted to the familiar insoluble inorganic rubber . In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process for the production of linear phosphonitrilic chloride pleionomers in short reaction periods. Besides enabling the pleionomers to be formed in periods of 20 hours or less, the process tends to yield light orange or yellow pleionomers. The invention is described more particularly below and is illustrated by the examples, the accompanying figure being a schematic diagram of an apparatus as used in carrying out Example IV. More specifically, this invention provides a process for producing linear phosphonitrilic chloride pleionomers from liquid, linear phosphonitrilic chloride oligomers of lower molecular weight which comprises heating said lower molecular weight oligomers at a temperature of between about 2750C. and 350 C. for about 1 to about 20 hours while concurrently withdrawing phosphorus pentachloride vapor from the liquid phase.The phosphorus pentachloride is thought to be evolved by condensation of the oligomers. However, irrespective of the mechanism whereby the PC15 is evolved, it is an aspect of this invention that the PCl5 vapor is effectively removed from the liquid phase and reaction vessel during the heating of the liquid phase. Thus, fast removal of PC15 vapor is particularly preferred.Since a large proportion of the total amount of PC15 given off during the reaction is evolved during the initial stages, effective removal of the PC15 vapor during this time is important. Accordingly, removal of the PCl5 vapor during the first 1 4 of the reaction period should be substantially continuous and at an average rate of at least about 20 hr. based on the total amount of PC15 evolved during the entire reaction.More preferably, this average initial rate is above 30 hr., and the most preferred average initial rate is above 40 hr. Thereafter, PC15 evolution tapers off thereby making effective removal of the vapor easier.Preferably the PC15 evolved during the second stage i.e., during the final 3 4 of the heating period is removed from the reaction vessel substantially as fast as it is formed, although less effective removal methods may be employed if desired. it has been found in laboratory experiments that the amount of PCl5 evolved will vary according to such factors as temperature, method of PC15 removal and quantity of stating oligomers. As stated earlier, the rate of PCl5 evolution is much greater during the initial stages of the reaction than during the later stages. For example, in one experimental run at about 300 C almost 68 of the total amount of PCl5 evolved was given off during the first 1 4 of the reaction period. In a run at 330 ., 93 of the total amount of PCl5 given off was evolved during the first 1 2 of the reaction. There are several methods by which the PCl5 may be removed. In a preferred embodiment, the PC15 vapor is withdrawn by maintaining a partial vacuum above the liquid phase. In another preferred embodiment, an inert gas such as nitrogen is bubbled through the liquid phase to effect withdrawal bf phosphorus pentachloride. In still another preferred embodiment, an inert gas is swept across the surface of the liquid phase. Of course the volume of the inert gas swept across the liquid phase will vary according to factors such as the size of the reaction vessel, the quantity of oligomer liquid, and the desired rate of PCl5 removal.In laboratory rrk it has been found that gas sweep rates of between 4 and 12 liters min. in a 3 liter flask containing about 1200 grams of liquid oligomer caused efficient removal of the PC15 vapor. A flow rate of about 6 to 10 liters min. is especially preferred. Other modifications and combinations of these preferred removal methods may be used in the process of the present invention. For example, it is desirable to effect removal of the phosphorus pentachloride by bubbling an inert gas through the liquid phase while concurrently maintaining a partial vacuum above the polymer liquid. The present process may be conducted between 275 0C. and 3500C. Higher temperatures up to the decomposition temperature of the polymer about 3600C. may be employed as long as no deleterious effects, such as excessive cross linking, result. The temperature at which this process is conducted involves consideration of such factors as time of heating, degree of conversion, etc. Desirably, the oligomer liquid is heated from 1 to 20 hours so as to produce the linear phosphonitrilic chloride polymer of higher molecular weight. Preferably, the reaction is heated for 1 to 7 hours at 3000C to 3500C. The starting materials used in the process are linear phosphonitrilic chloride oligomers having the structural formula EMI6.1 where n is an integer from about 2 to about 10. Without being bound to a particular mechanism, it is believed the condensation effected by the present process causes a change in the maeup of the polymer end group. That is, the resulting polymer has the structural formulaEMI6.2 where m is greater than 10. Thus, the products formed in the process of this invention have a number average molecular weight of at least about 1450, and preferably between about 2000 and about 12000, as measured by theVapor Pressure Osmometry technique. As may be deduced, PC15 is evolved and the molecular weight increases as the reaction progresses.Therefore, for a known quantity of oligomer, a theoretical yield for PC15 in the complete conversion of oligomer to pleionomer may be calculated.In actual practice it will be found that due to temperature anc other reaction conditions, the amount of PC15 evolved will be somewhat less than predicted by theoretical calculations. PCl5 yields of 97 up to 1009 of the theoretical yield are generally obtained. The starting oligomers are toluene insoluble and waxy, generally having a number average molecular weight of 600 to 1200 as measured by the Vapor Pressure Osmometry technique. The oligomers may be prepared in various ways and their method of preparation is not critical to our process. For example, they may be produced by reacting an excess of phosphorus penta chloride with ammonium chloride under anhydrous con ditions in a retluxing solvent, which method is well known in the art. Preferably, the linear oligomers may be prepared via the process described in our co pending application That application discloses Åa process wherein PC13 and C12 are reacted in a suitable medium in the first step of a two step process.In the second step, PCl3, C12 and NH3 are concurrently fed into said medium while keeping the temperature at 1000C to 1400C. The feeds of the reactants are controlled so that until the first 1 2 of the NH3 has been reacted the molar ratio of PCl3 NH3 including the PCl3 of the first step is kept above 2. Thereafter, the feeds are adjusted so that with respect to the total amount of ammonia, said molar ratio is between 1.2 and 1.5. Linear phosphonitrilic chloride oligomers having a number average degree of polymerization from 2 to 9 are produced via the process in high yield.Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention linear phosphonitrilic chloride polymers are prepared by a introducing phosphorus trichloride and chloride intra a substantially anhydrous, inert liquid reaction medium b introducing hydrogen chloride into said reaction medium c introducing phosphorus trichloride, chlorine, and ammonia concurrently into said reaction medium while maintaining said medium at a temperature within the range of from about 1000C. to about 1400C., the rates at which the phosphorus trichloride, chlorine, and ammonia are introduced being regulated such that i The molar ratio of phosphorus trichloride to chlorine introduced initially is from 0.9 to 1.1, ii with respect to the first half of the total amount of ammonia being used, the average molar ratio of phosphorus trichloride of a is kept above two, and iii with respect to the total amount of ammonia being used, the average molar ratio of phosphorus tri chloride of a is within the range of from about 1.2 to about 1.5 d isolating the linear phosphonitrilic chloride oligomers formed in the reaction medium, and then, e heating said lower molecular weight oligomers in liquid phase at a temperature of between about 2750C. and 350 C. for about 1 to about 20 hours while con currently withdrawing phosphorus penta . chloride vapor from said liquid phase. In conducting the process of this invention, it has been found advantageous tb remove solid impurities from the oligomer liquid. Oftentimes, impurities appear in the form black specks dispersed in the oligomer liquid even after purifying the oligomer by means of a suitable solvent and filtration. These impurities may result, for example, from contaminants in the reagents used to make the starting material or from contaminants in the equipment used to manufacture the starting material. Since these impurities could affect the properties of the product, it is desirable that they be removed. Any method known to one skilled in the art may be employed including filtration, distillation, and centrifugation. There even greater purity is desired, the oligomer liquid may be swirled with a magnetic stirrer which causes the contaminants to mitrate to the vortex Selective removal of liquid at the vortex, e.g., by pipetting the liquid, effectively removes most of the contaminants. The phosphonitrilic chloride pleinomers prepared by the present process may be substituted with aryloxy and or alkoxy groups to form substituted pre polymers useful as hydraulic fluids, lubricants and flameretardants. Methods for such substitution are well known in the art and are described, for example, inU. S. 3,443,913 U. S. 3,856,712 U. S. 3,883,451 andU. S. 4,055,523. Alternatively, aryloxy and alkoxy substituted prepolymers containing ethylenic unsaturation can be compounded and cured by crosslinking to produce elastomers, coatings, adhesives, potting compounds, thermoset plastics and flexible or rigid foams. E At2LE I A 3 liter, five necked round bottom flask was fitted with a thermometer having a Therm o Watche temperature controller attached thereto, a nitrogen inlet tube, and two N2 PC15 outlet tubes. Into the flask were placed 1256 grams of liquid, linear, low molecular weight number average MW 500 1000 phosphonitrilic chloride oligomers. This liquid material was heated to 2800 20C. for 9.5 hours while being agitated by a mechanical stirrer. Nitrogen was swept across the liquid material by introducing a flow of N2 through the inlet tube which was positioned above the liquid level. In this way the PC15 vapors were effectively removed from the reaction vessel.The rate of N2 flow into the vessel was about 8 liters min. during the entire heating period. At the end of this time the reaction vessel contained 600 grams of higher molecular weight, liquid, linear product. This resultant polymer product was an orange, viscous oil which was soluble in toluene and chloroform. A sample was dissolved in toluene and when subjected to the Vapor Pressure Osmometry PO technique was found to have a number average molecular weight of 5720. ELEMPLE II The procedure of Example I was repeated using 1375 grams of starting material. In this case the N2 was dispersed throughout the polymer liquid to effect removal of the PCl5. The dispersal was accomplished by positioning the N2 inlet tube below the liquid level.The reaction time was 9.5 hours and 595 grams of higher molecular weight, liquid, linear product was obtained at the end of the reaction. The number average molecular weight was 6810. EXTiLE III In this experiment, the general procedure ofExample I was followed except that agitation of the oligomer liquid was effected by use of a magnetic stirrer. 1183 grams of starting material were reacted over a period of 14 hours. A sample taken from the 600 grams of product obtained was found to have a number average molecular weight of 4530. EXAMPLE IV In this instance PCl5 removal was effected by pulling a vacuum above the polymer liquid. Referring now to the drawing, a 2 liter, round bottom flask 10 was fitted with a mechanical stirrer 12, a thermometer 14 having a Therm o Watch temperature controller 16a and 16b attached thereto, and a 900 adapter 18.The flask was cradled in a heating mantle 20, the temperature of which was controlled by the Therm oWatch controller. A 2 liter separator funnel type flask 28 having a stopcock 44 was connected to the flask 10 by a stem 22 joining the adapter 18 to a vacuum take off adapter 24 mounted in the flask 28.Heating tape 26 was zapped around the stem in order to prevent condensation of the PCl5 vapor as it passed through the stem into the flask 28. The flask 28 was also fitted with a thermometer 32 also having a Therm o WatchS temperature controller 34a and 34b attached thereto and a pressure equalizing funnel 30.A heating mantle 36, the temperature of which was controlled by the Therm o Watchw controller 34a and 34b, supported the flask 28. A suction pump 40 and a pressure gauge 42 were connected to the vacuum take off adapter 24 by means of stem 38. Into the flask 10 were placed 1500 grams of low molecular weight, linear phosphonitrilic chloride oligomers. Into the 28 was placed 1 liter of 1,2,4trichlorobenzene so that the liquid level was below the outlet port of the vacuum take off adapter. While the temperature of the flask 10 was maintained at about 276 C. to 280 C., the temperature of flask 28 was kept at about 100 C. A partial vacuum of approx imarely 156 mm Hg. was maintained above the polymer liquid by the suction pump 40. As PCl5 vapor was generated during the reaction, it was carried through the stem 22 to the vacuum take off adapter 24 and into the solvent. When the solvent became saturated with PCl5, the saturated solution was discharged through the stopcock 44 and fresh solvent was introduced via the addition funnel 30. At various times during the reaction 1 gram supplies were dissolved in a suitable solvent and analyzed using P31 N5R to determine the degree of conversion of the oligomer to the polymer. Table I below sets forth the results.

The product was a yellowish, viscous oil having a number average x of 8100 as measured by the VPO technique. EXEMPLE V In this example the general procedure ofExample I was followed at 300 2 C. 1310 grams of starting oligomer were reacted for seven hours at the end of which time 580 grams of yellowish, viscous polymer remained in the reaction vessel. At selected intervals samples were dissolved in a suitable solvent and analyzed under p31 NMR to determine the percentage of conversion to the higher MW polymers. At each of these intervals, the reaction flask was welgrec in order to determine the amount of PCl5 evolved and the removal rate which is an average based on the average amount of PCl5 evolved divided by the total cf the PCl5 evolved .
