# Bleach composition.

## Abstract
A low temperature bleach system comprises a peracid precursor system and bromide ions. The bromide ions may be supplied by sodium bromide. A theoretical peracid to bromide equivalent ratio between 2 1 and 1 2 is preferred, but dye transfer and hygiene benefits are possible with a ratio up to 1 32. The precursor system is typically diph thaloyl peroxide or sodium perborate plus tetraacetyl ethy lenediamine TAED . If the perborate is in excess, a scavenger such as catalase should be included. The system may be used as such or incorporated in a conventional detergent base.
