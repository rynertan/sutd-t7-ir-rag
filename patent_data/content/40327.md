# Engine mounting structure for automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
An engine mounting structure for mounting an automo tive engine 1 on the body structure of an automotive vehicle, comprising the parallel combination of a main oscillatory system 37 adapted to damp vibrations produced by the engine 1 during medium speed cruising of the vehicle and an auxiliary oscillatory system 36 adapted to cancel the vibrations to be transmitted through the main oscillatory sys tem 37 under high speed cruising conditions of the vehicle for reducing booming noises to be produced in the vehicle cabin under such conditions. The auxiliary oscillatory system 36 comprises at least two rigid mass members 34,35 43,44 and at least three resilient blocks 31,32,33 41,42,46 structur ally intervening between the main oscillatory system 37 and the mass members 34,35 43,44 .
