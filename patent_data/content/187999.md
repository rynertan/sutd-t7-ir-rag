## Description
COPOLYESTER CARBONATE COMPOSITION BACKGROUND Or THE I5JENTION Copolyester carbonate resins are well known thermoplastic materials which, due to their many advantageous properties, find use as thermoplastic engineering materials. The copolyester carbonate resin may be conveniently propared by the react ion of a dihydric phenol, a carbonate precursor, ana an ester precursor. These resins exhibit, for example, excellent properties of toughness, flexibility, impact strength, and thermal resistance.However, conventional copolyester carbonate resins, due to their relatively high melt viscosities, are generally relatively difficult to process. The problem of providing copolyester carbonate resins exhibiting imporved processability has been met by workers in the art by adding. various types of additives to the copolyester carbonate resins which improve the processability of these resins.The addition of these additives, while generally being effective in improving their processability has the disadvantage of sometimes adversely affecting some of the other advantageous properties of copoly ester carbonate resins, particularly their heat resistance. It would thus be very advantageous if copolyester carbonate resins could be provided which retained, to a substantial degree, substantially most of their other advantageous properties, part icularly their high heat resistance, and also exhibited improved processability. It is, therefore, an object oT the instant invention to prove copolyester carbonate resins exhibiting improved porcessability and high heat resistance. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the instant invention there are provided copolyester carbonate resin compositions exhibiting improved processability and high heat resistance comprised of, in physical admixture i at least one high molecular weight thermoplastic aromatic copolyester carbonate resin the major portion of the ester component of said resin being isophthalate and ii an amount effective to improve the processability of said copolyester carbonate resin of at least one carbonate copolymer derived from a carbonate precursor, at least one dihydric phenol, and a di hydroxyaryl sulfone represented by the general formulaEMI2.1 wherein R1 is independently selected from halogen radicals and monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, and m is an integer having a value of from 0 to 4 inclusive. DESCRIP T ION OF THE INVENTION The instant invention is directed to copoly ester carbonate resins exhibiting good resistance to stress crazing and cracking, improved processability, and good heat resistance. More particularly the instant invention is directed to blends of particular copolyester carbonate resins and particular carbonate copolymers.The instant blends are comprised of, in physical admixture i at least one high molecular weight thermoplastic aromatic copolyester carbonate resin, the major portion of the ester component of said resin being isophthalate and ii an amount effective to improve the processability of said copolyester carbonate resin of a high molecular weight thermoplastic aromatic carbonate copolymer derived from a carbonate precursor, at least one dihydric phenol, and a di hydroxyaryl sulfone. Briefly stated the high molecular weight thermoplastic aromatic copolyester carbonate resins comprise recurring carbonate groups, carboxylate groups, and aromatic carbocyclic groups in the polymer chain in which at least some of the carbonate groups and at least some of the carboxylate groups are bonded directly to the ring carbon atoms of the aromatic carbocyclic groups. These copolyester carbonates contain ester bonds and carbonate bonds in the polymer chain, wherein the amount of ester bonds ester content is in the range of from about 25 to about 0 mole percent, preferably from about 35 to about 80 mole percent ester bonds ester content . For example, 5 moles of bisphenol A reacting completely with 4 moles of isophtbaloyl di chloride and 1 mole of phosgene would give a copolyester carbonate of 80 mole percent ester bonds ester content . The ester content of this copolyester carbonate would be comprised of 100 mole percent of the residue of isophthaloyl dichloride. The copolyester carbonates of the instant invention, as well as methods for their preparation, are disclosed, inter alia, in U.S. PatentNos. 3,169,121, 4,238,596, 4,456,820, and 4,238, 597, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The copolyester carbonates may be prepared by a variety of methods including melt polymerization, transesterification, and the interfacial polymerization processes. These copolyester carbonates may be readily prepared by the reaction of a at least one dihydric phenol, b a carbonate precursor and c at least one ester precursor, the major portion of said ester precursor being the isophthlate precursor. The dihydric phenols useful in the preparation of the instant copolyester carbonates may be represented by the general formula EMI5.1 whereon R is independently selected from halogen and monovalent hydrocarbon radicals A is selected from divalent hydrocarbon radicals, 0 , andEMI5.2 n is independently selected from integers having a value of from 0 to 4 inclusive and b is either zero or one. The monovalent hydrocarbon radicals represented by R in Formula I include the alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, and alkaryl radicals. Preferred alkyl radicals are those containing from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. Preferred cycloalkyl radicals are those containing from 4 to about 8 ring carbon atoms.

It is, of course,possible to employ a mixture of two or more different dihydric phenols in the preparation of the instant copolyester carbonates. The carbonate precursor may be a carbonyl halide, a carbonate ester, or a bishaloformate. The carbonyl halides which may be employed herein are carbonyl bromide, carbonyl chloride, cr mixtures thereof. Typical carbonate esters which may be used are diphenyl carbonate di halophenyl carbonates such as di chlorophenyl carbonate, di bromophenyl carbonate, di trichlorophenyl carbonate, etc. di alkylphenyl carbonates such as di tolyl carbonate, etc. phenyl toyl carbonate chlorophenyl chloronaphthyl carbonate etc., or mixtures thereof. The bishaloformates suitable for use herein include the bishaloformates of dihydric phenols such as the bischloroformates of hydroquinone, bischloroformate of bisphenol A, and the like or bishaloformates of glycols such as the bischloroformates of ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, and the like.The preferred carbonate precursor is phosgene, also known as carbonyl chloride. The ester precursor is such so as to provide a copolyester carbonate wherein the major portion of the ester component is comprised of isophthalate moieties. Generally, the ester component of the copolyester carbonate resin contains from about 60 to 100 mole percent isophthalate moieties, preferably from about 70 to 100 mole percent isophthalate moieties, more preferably from about 80 to 100 mole percent isophthalate moieties, and most preferably from about 90 to 100 mole percent isophthalate moieties.While the ester component may be comprised of 100 mole percent isophthalate msieties, it is usually quite useful i8 the ester component cortairs at least about 2 mole percent other ester moities such as, for example, terephthalate moities The ester precursor is thus generally comprised of from about 60 to 100 mole percent isophthalate precursor, preferably from about 70 to 100 mole percent isophthalate precursor, more preferably from about 80 to 100 mole percent isophthalate precursor, and most preferably from about 90 to 100 mole percent isophthalate precursor.The isophthalate precursor may be isophthalic acid or an ester forming reactive derivative thereof such as, for example, isophthaloyl dihalide such as isohthaloyl dichloride It is preferred that the ester precursor be the ester forming reactive derivative of the isophthalic acid. If a copolyester carbonate resin containing an ester component comprised of at least about 2 mole percent of an ester other than isophthalate is desired then the ester precursor will comprise a mixture of an isophthalate precursor and at least one of a difunctional carboxylic or an ester forming reactive derivative thereof other than isophthalic acid. Some of these difunctional carboxylic acids are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,169,121, which is incorporated herein by reference. A particularly useful ester precursor of this type is a terephthalate precursor, i.e., terephthalic acid or an ester forming reactive derivative thereof. Particularly useful ester precursors are those containing at least about 60 mole percent isophthaloyl dihalide, preferably isophthaloyl dichloride, preferably at least about 70 mole percent isophthaloyl dihalide, more preferably at least about 80 mole percent isophthaloyl dihalide, and most preferably at least about 90 mole percent isophthaloyl dihalide. Preferred ester precursors of this type contain from about 2 to about 15 mole percent of terephthaloyl dihalide, preferably terephthaloyl dichloride, preferably from about 2 to about 10 mole percent terephthaloyl dihalide, and more preferably from about 3 to about 9 mole percent terephthaloyl dihalide. Particularly useful copolyester carbonates are those containing from about 70 to about 80 mole percent ester content, said ester content being comprised of at least about 90 mole percent isophthalate. Preferred copolyester carbonates of this type have an ester content comprised of from about 90 to about 98 mole percent isophthalate and from about 2 to about 10 mole percent terephthalate, In these resins the carbonate precursor is preferably phosgene and the dihydric phenol is preferably bisphenol A. These types of resins are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,456,820, incorporated herein by reference. One method for preparing the copolyester carbonates of this invention is the interfacial polymerization process using an aqueous caustic solution, an organic water immiscible solvent such as methylene chloride, a catalyst, and a molecular weight regulator. The catalysts which may be employed are any of the well known catalysts that catalyze the copolyester carbonate forming reaction. These catalysts include, but are not limited to, tertiary gamines such as triethylamine, tripropyl gamine, N,N dimethylaniline, quaternary ammonium compounds, and quaternary phosphonium compounds. The molecular weight regulators are any of the known compounds that regulate the molecular weight of the copolyester carbonate by a chair terrrtinating mechanism. These compounds include, but are not limited to, phenol, tertiarybutyl phenol, and chroman I. The instant copolyester carbonates will have a weight average molecular weight in the range of from about 20,000 to about 200,000, and preferably from about 25,000 to about 100,000, Also included within the scope of the instant invention are the thermoplastic randomly branched high molecular weight aromatic copolyester carbonates. These randomly branched copolyester carbonates are derived from at least one dihydric phenol ofFormula I, a carbonate precursor, an ester precursor, and a minor amount of a branching agent. The branching agents are well known compounds and are generally aromatic compounds containing at least three functional groups which may be hydroxyl, carboxyl, carboxylic anhydride, haloformyl, or mixtures thereof.Some illustrative non limiting examples of these polyfunctional organic compounds include trimellitic anhydride, trimellitic acid, trimellityl trichloride, 4 chloroformyl phthalic anhydride, pyrommellitic acid, pyromellitic dianhydride, mellitic acid, mellitic anhydride, trimesic acid, benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid, and benzophenonetetracarboxylic anhydride so included herein are blends of linear and branched copolyester carbonates. t is critical to the instant invention that the ester component of the instant copolyester carbonates be comprised e a major portion of iso phthalate. It is the presence of this isophthalate, in major amounts, that renders the instant conolyeste carbonates more resistant to stress crazing and cracking. Particulary useful copolyester carbonates of this type are those containing at least 90 mole percent of isophthalate as the ester component. The polycarbonates which are blended with the copolyester carbonates described hereinafore are carbonate copolymers derived from a carbonate precursor, at least one dihydric phenol of Formula I, and at least one dithydroxyazyl sulfone represented by the general formulaEMI11.1 wherein R1 is independently selected from halogen radicals and monovalent hydrocarbon radicals and m is independently selected from integers having a value of from 0 to 4 inclusive. The halogen radicals and monovalent hydrocarbon radicals represented by R are the same as those defined for R hereinafore. The preferred di hycroxy2 y1 sulfor.es cf Formula II are those wherein R1 is independently selected from alkyl radicals, preferably the lower alkyl radicals containing from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, with the methyl radical being the preferred lower alkyl radical. Particularly useful di hydroxyaryl sulfones of this type are those wherein each m is twc.The preferred di hydroxyaryl sulfones of FormulaII are the dixylenol sulfones, with bis 3,5 dimethyl4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone being preferred. These polycarbonates generally contain from about 20 to about 80 mole percent of a residue of the di hydroxyaryl sulfone of Formula II and from about 80 to about 20 mole percent of a residue of a dihydric phenol of Formula I preferably from about 30 to about 70 mole percent of said di hydroxyaryl sulfone residue and from about 70 to about 30 mole percent of said dihydric phenol residue and more preferably from about 40 to about 60 mole percent of said di hydroxyaryl sulfone residue and from 60 to about 40 mole percent of said dihydric phenol residue. Mole percent of di hydroxyaryl sulfone residue and dihydric phenol residue is measured as the amount of said residues present in the total amount of the residues of said di hydroxyaryl sulfone and residues of said dihydric phenol present in the carbonate polymer.These types of carbonate copolymers are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,737,409, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. A particularly useful carbonate copolv,2r of tis type is cne derived from phosgene, bisphenol A, and bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone. Preferred carbonate ccpcl rners of this type are those contanlng from about 40 to about 6 mole percent of the residue of the di hydroxyaryl sulone of Formula II and from about 60 to about 40 mole percent of the residue of bisphenol A. The instant carbonate copolymers have a weight average molecular weight in the range of from about 20,000 to about 200,000, preferably from about 25,000 to about 100,000. The amount of the carbonate copolymer component ii present in the instant compositions is an amount effective to positively upgrade the processability of the copolyester carbonate resins, i.e., increase the melt flow rate and decrease the melt viscosity.Greater than these amounts may be employed so long as the properties desired for a particular application of these compositions are substantially maintained. That is to say, the amount of the polycarbonate component ii present is an amount effective to improve the processability of the copolyester carbonate resin but insufficient to significantly deleteriously affect substantially most of the other advantageous properties of the copolyester carbonate resin. Generally, a minimum of about 5 weight percent of the polycarbonate is sufficient to observe an improvement in processability of the copolyester carbonate. A minimum of about 7 weight percent of the polycarbonate is preferred, while a minimum of about 10 weight percent is more preferred.A level of about 70 weight percent of the polycarbonate should generally not be exceeded, prefrably a level of about 60 weight percent, and mcre preferably a level of about 40 weight percent. Weight percent is measured as the amount cf polvcarbonate present in the total cf ccpolyestr carbonate and polycarbonate. The composition of the instant invention may optionally have admixed therewith the commonly known and used additives such as, for example, antioxidants mcld release agents inert fillers such. as talc, clay, mica, glass fibers, and glass spheres ultraviolet radiation absorbers such as the benzophenones, benzotriazoles, and cyanoacrylates hydrolytic stabilizers such as the epoxides disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,489,716, 4,138,379 and 3,839,247, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference color stabilizers such as the organophosphite disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,305,520 and 4,118, 370, both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference impact modifiers and flame retardants. Some particularly useful flame retardants are the alkali and alkaline earth metals salts of organic sulfonic acids. These types of flame retardants are disclosed, inter alia, in U.S. PatentNos. 3,933,734, 3,948,851, 3,926,908, 3,919,167, 3,909,490, 3,953,396, 3,931,100, 3,978,024, 3,953,399, 3,917,559, 3,951,910 and 3,940,366, all of which are incorporated herein by refererence. These flame retardantcompounds are present in amounts effective to render the instant compositions flame retardant.In general these amounts range from about 0.01 to about 10 weight percent, based on the total amount of flame retardant, copolyester carbonate, and polycarbonate. Another embodiment of the instant invention is a copolyester carbonate resin derived from a carbonate precursor, at least one ester precursor, at least one dihydric phenol of Formula I, and at least one di hydroxyaryl sulfone of Formula II. This copolyester carbonate resin will exhibit improved processability while simultaneously exhibiting good heat resistance, i.e., heat resistance generally comparable to unmodified copolyester carbonate resins such as those derived from a carbonate precursor, at least one dihydric phenol1 and at least one ester precursor.The copolyester carbonates of this embodiment will generally have an ester content of from about 25 to about 90 mole percent and a carbonate content of from about 10 to about 75 mole percent, preferably an ester content of from about 35 to about 80 mole percent and a carbonate content of from about 20 to about 65 mole percent, more preferably an ester content of from about 70 to about 80 mole percent and a carbonate content of from about 20 to about 30 mole percent. The amount of the di hydroxyaryl sulfone residue present in the carbonate component of the copolyester carbonate resin will generally be from about 20 to about 80 mole percent, preferably from about 30 to about 70 mole percent, and more preferably from about 40 to about 60 mole percent. The carbonate component of these copolyester carbonates will thus generally be comprised of from about 20 to about 80 mole percent of the residue of a di hydroxyaryl sulfone of formula II, preferably the residue of a dixylenol sulfone such as bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone, and from about 80 to about 20 mole percent of the residue of a dihydric phenol of Formula I, preferably bisphenol A preferably from about 30 to about 70 mole percent of the residue of a di hydroxyaryl sulfone cf Formula II and from about 70 to about 30 mole percent of the residue of a dihydric phenol of Formula I and more preferably from about 40 to about 60 mole percent of a residue of said di hydroxyaryl sulone and from about 60 to about 40 mole percent of a residue of said dihydric phenol. Mole percent of the residue of the di hydroxyaryl sulone residue present in the carbonate component is measured as the amount of said di hydroxyaryl sulfone residue present based on the total amounts of the di hydroxyaryl sulfone and dihydric phenol residues present in the carbonate component. The carbonate precursor and the ester precursor utilized in the preparation of the copolyestercarbonate resins of this invention are generally of the type described hereinafore. Particularly useful ester precursors are those that provide copolyester carbonates containing, as the ester component, at least about 90 mole percent isophthalate. Preferred ester precusors of this type are those that provide copolyester carbonate containing a ester component comprised of from about 90 to about 98 mole percent isophthalate and from about 2 to about 10 mole percent terephthalate. The copolyester carbonate resin of this embodiment may be prepared by the conventional well known methods as set forth hereinafore. Also included within the scope of this embodiment are the randomly branched copolyester carbonates prepared by the reaction of a carbonate precursor, at least one ester precursor, at least one dihydric phenol of Formula I, at least one di hydroxyaryl sulfone of Formula II, anda minor amount of a branching agent of the type described hereinafore. The copolyester carbonate resin of this embodiment may optionally have admixed therewith the commonly known and used additives as described hereinafore, particularly the flame retardants and the impact modifiers. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRiEFERRED DiBODIMENTS In order that those skilled in the art may better understand how the instant invention is practiced the following examples are set forth.These examples are set forth by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. In the examples all parts and percentages are parts and percentages by weight, unless otherwise specified. The following example illustrates a copolyestercarbonate falling outside the scope of the instant invention in that it does not contain any of the carbonate copolymer admixed therewith. This example is presented for comparative purposes only. EXAMPLE 1 A copolyester carbonate resin containing a 75 mole percent ester content, 100 mole percent cf said ester content being isophthalate, and derived from the reaction of phosgene, bisphenol A, ard isophthaloyl dihalide, is fd to an extruder operating at 2 temperature of about 3060C. The extrudate is commuted into pellets and the pellets are injection molded at about 347 0C into test samples measuring 63.5 mm x 12.7 mm x 3.2 mm thick The following examples illustrate copolyestercarbonate compositions of the instant invention. EXAMPLE 2 A composition containing 90 parts by weight of a copolyester carbonate resin of Example 1, and 10 parts by weight of a carbonate copolymer containing equal molar amounts of the residue of bisphenol A and bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone, derived from bisphenol A, bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone, and phosgene, was prepared by physically blending the ingredients together. The resulting mixture was fed to an extruder operating at a temperature of about 3040C. The extrudate was comminuted into pellets and the pellets were injection molded at about 347 C into test samples measuring 63,5mm x 12.7mm x 3.2mm thick. EXAMPLE 3 The procedure of Example 2 was substantially repeated except that 80 parts by weight of the copolyester carbonate resin of Example 1 and 20 parts by weight of the carbonate copolymer ofExample 2 were used. EXAMPLE 4 The procedure of Example 2 was substantially repeated except that 60 parts by weight of the copolyester carbonate resin of Example 1 and 40 parts by weight of the carbonate copolymer ofExample 2 were used. The Heat Distortion Temperature Under Load DTUL of samples from Examples 1 4 was determined in accordance with ASTM D648, and the results are set forth in Table I. Also determined for the resin mixtures fromExamples 1 4 is the Kasha Index. The Kasha Index KT is an indication of the processability of the resin compositions. The lower the KI the greater the melt flow and, therefore, the better the processability of the composition. The KashaIndex is a measurement of the melt viscosity of the resinous compositions.The procedure for determining the Kasha Index is as follows 7 grams of resinous pellets, dried a minimum of 90 minutes at 1250C,are added to a modified Tinius Olsen modelT3 melt indexer the temperature in the indexer is maintained at 3000C and the resin is heated at this temperature for six minutes after six minutes the resin is forced through a 0.04125 inch radius orifice using a plunger of radius of 0.1865 inch and an applied force of 17.7 lbs. the time required for the plunger to travel 2 inches is measured in centiseconds and this is reported asKI. The higher the KI the higher the melt viscosity of the resin and the more difficult it is to process. The results of this test are also set forth in Table I. TABLE IExample DTUL No. KI C 1 50,670 162.4 2 36,300 165.8 3 34,850 164.2 4 37,200 174.0 As illustrated by the data in Table I the con positions of the instant invention Examples 2 4 exhibit a lower XI, and are therefore easier to process, than the control of Example 1. Further more, the heat resistance of the instant compositions, as indicated by the DTUL, is not in any way compromised relative to the control of Example 1. The instant compositions are useful in the manufacture of molded articles, films and sheets. The foregoing detailed description has been given for clearness of understanding only and no unnecessary limitations are to be understood therefrom. The invention is not limited to the exact details shown and described herein, for obvious modifications will occur to those skilled in the art.
