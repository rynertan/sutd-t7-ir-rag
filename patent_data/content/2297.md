## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF DL PHENYL GLYClNE AMIDE The invention relates to a process for the preparation ofDL phenylglycine amide, which is a suitable starting compound for the preparation of D phenylglycine amide. The latter compound can be converted into D phenylglycine, which is used especially as a S . tlng material in the synthesis of penicillin compounds. According to a known process see Netherlands Patent Applications 7513551 and 77COOq2 , D phenylglycine amide can be prepared from DL phenylglycine amide by means of an enzyme preparation. L phenylglycine is then obtained as a by product in an amount that is equal in principle to the amount of D phenylglycine amide.However no uses are known for this by product wherely the total amount of by product and the D phenylglycine amide can be utilized in an economically justified way. A suitable manner has now been found for converting L phenylglycine into DL phenylglycine amide. The process according to the invention for the preparation of DL phenylglycine amide is characterized in that L phenylglycine is converted into an ester with an alcohol, the ester is racemized in the presence of a concentrated strong acid, eg. sulphuric acid, oleum, benzene sulphonic acids, and p toluene sulphonic acid, and the resulting DL ester is converted into DL phenylglycine amide. In the process according to the invention, n ester ofL phenylglycine can be prepared by various known methods. A particularly suitable method is the esterification of L phenylglycine with an alcohol in the presence of a concentrated strong acid, e.g. sulphuric acid,oleum,benzene sulhcnLc acid and p toluene sulFhonic acid, which concentrated strong acid is also used in the racemization of the resulting ester according to the invention. The alcohol used by preference in the esterification is an aliphatic monovalent alcohol with 1 4 carbon atoms. As is usual in esterification, in practice excess alcohol should be present e.g. 5 10 times as much alcohol as is required stoichiometrically.The amount of concentrated acid present during the esterification may be varied, but to obtain good results preferably at least 2.5 equivalents of acid i.e. 1.25 moles of a dibasic or 2.5 moles of a monobasic acid are used per mole of phenyl glycine. To avoid hydrolysis of the ester during racemization, the water content of the concentrated acid should be as low as possible, and preferably should not exceed the water content of 96 ,o by weight sulphuric acid. The esterification can readily be carried out at temperatures that are normally used for such a reaction, e.g. a temperature of 50 90 OC The racemization of the resulting ester in the presence of a concentrated strong acid can be carried out by heating the ester and the acid, e.g. any of the abovementioned acids, at a temperature between 120 and 200 C, preferably 140 175 OC, for e.g.3 10 hours. The pressure used may be atmospheric. Both the esterification and the racemization is preferably carried out in the presence of concentrated sulphuric acid. In order to form the DL phenylglycine amide from the DL ester obtained in the racemization, the DL ester may be separated as such from the reaction mixture obtained in the racemization and be converted into the DL amide by means of ammonia in known manner. The separation from acid reaction mixture of the Ester as such is however not necessary.The entire reaction mixture if desired may be added to aqueous ammonia e.g. of concentration 10 35 by weight of NH and the amide be recovered from the 3 resulting reaction mixture, which contains nT phenylgiwvoine amide and the ammonium salt of the acid used in the racemization, e.g.ammonium sulphate, or the resulting reaction mixture containing amide may be used as such in the enzymatic conversion of DL phenylglycine amide into D phenylglycine amide and L phenylglycine. The temperature in this amide formation may be any temperature that is usual for the formation of an anide from an ester with ammonia, 0 e.g. a temperature of 20 50 C. The invention will be further elucidated in the following examples.Example I 21 millilitres 0.375 mole of 96 gO by weight sulphuric acid are added with stirring to a solution of 45.3 grams 0.3 mole of L phenylglycine in 120 grams of methanol. The mixture is then boiled at atmospheric pressure for 2 hours with reflux cooling.From the resulting reaction mixture, 106.8 grams of methanol water mixture are distilled at atmospheric pressure, by which a bottom 0 temperature of 160 C is reached. The resulting reaction mixture 0 containing ester is subsequently heated at 160 C and atmospheric pressure for 5 hours with stirring in order to be racemized. 97.2 grams of racemized reaction mixture are obtained. Amino acid analysis of a sample of the racemized reaction mixture shows that 6.1 by weight of phenylglycine is contained in this mixture.A second sample of said reaction mixture is fully hydrolysed by boiling it with reflux cooling for 24 hours with 100 grams of 6 N hydrochloric acid per 0.5 millilitre of sample. Amino acid analysis of the hydrolysed sample shows that it contains 46.1 7oby weight of phenylglycine.It can be calculated from the results of the two amino acid analyses that 86.7 y of the original amount of phenylglycine has been converted into ester. To determine the specific rotation of the racemized phenylglycine ester obtained, a 8.5 gram sample of the racemized reaction mixture is hydrolysed by boiling it with reflux cooling for 6 hours with 100 grams of 6 N sulphuric acid and, after neutralization of the hydrolysed product, separating the phenylglycine and the specific rotation of the resulting phenylglycine is determined.It amounts to 20 alD 2.1 c 1.0 1.0 N HCl Comparison of the measured specific rotation with the corresponding specific rotation of pure L phenylglycine 157.50 reveals that 98.6 of the phenylglycine ester have been racemized. 30 grams of methanol are added to 87.5 grams of the resulting reaction mixture containing DL phenylglycine ester in order to lower the viscosity of the reaction mixture, after which the 0 resulting solution is slowly added with stirring at 40 C to 225 millilitres of ammonia water 25 by weight of MH3 and the mixture 3 obtained is stirred at 40 OC for 4 hours. Next, the ammonia and methanol present are removed by distillaticn. The remaining reaction mixture 198 grams is dissolved in water to form 749 grams of solution. Amino acid analysis of a sample shows that this solution contains 4.0 by weight of DL phenylglycine amide and 1.4 0 by weight of DL phenylglycine. Hence, 85.4 of the total amount of DL phenyl glycine ester has been converted into the amide.Example II 42 millilitres 0.75 mole of 96 by weight sulphuric acid is added with stirring to a solution of 90.6 grams 0.6 mole ofL phenylglycine in 160 grams of methanol . The mixture is then boiled with reflux cooling at atmospheric pressure for 3 hours. From the resulting reaction mixture, 140 grams of methanol water mixture are distilled at atmospheric pressure, by which a bottom temperature 3f 140 OC is reached. The resulting reaction mixture containing ester is 0 subsequently heated at 140 C and atmospheric pressure in order 1 o be racemized. After the resulting racemized reaction mixture 172.3 grams has cooled, 40 grams of methanol are added. Amino acid analysis of a sample of the resulting racemived reaction mixture containing methanol shows 6.4 by weight of phenylglycine are contained in the reaction mixture obtained in the racemization. A second sample of said reaction mixture is fully hydr ysed by boiling it with reflux cooling for 24 hours with 100 grams of N hydrochlorid acid per 0.5 millilitre of sample. Amino acid analysis of the hydrolysed sample shows that it contains 42 t0 by weight ot phenylglycine. It can be calculated from the results oi the two amino acid analyses that 84.8 of the original amount of phenylglycine has been converted into ester. To determine the specific rotation of the racemized phenylglycine ester obtained, a 10 gram sample of reaction mixture containing methanol is hydrolysed in the same way as in Example I, after the methanol has been distilled off, and the specific rotation of the resulting phenylglycine is determined. It amounts to 20 3.8 c 1.0 1.0 N HCl DComparison of the measured specific rotation with the corresponding 0 specific rotation of pure L phenylglycine 157.5 reveals that 97.6 of thephenylglycine ester have been racemized.
