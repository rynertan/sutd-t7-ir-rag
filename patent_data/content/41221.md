# A wrist mechanism in an industrial robot.

## Abstract
A wrist mechanism in an industrial robot comprises a wrist 13 , a rotary type actuator 11 which is rotatable in clockwise and counter clockwise directions, a first positioning board 33 which can define arbitrary angular stopping posi tions, sensing devices 62 , and a second positioning board 35 which is arranged facing the first positioning board 33 , wherein the sensing devices 62 detect the angular position of the wrist 13 , which is driven by the rotary type actuator 11 , the rotary type actuator 11 is stopped by signals pro duced by the sensing devices 62 , and the second positioning board 35 with tapered receptacles 351 is pressed to the first positioning board 33 with tapered pins 331 , whereby the positioning of the wrist mechanism is carried out.
