# Batch placement system for electronic components or chips.

## Abstract
A batch chip placement system and method for position ing semiconductor chips 24A, B, C or the like upon a substrate 15 containing an array of chip sites or footprints whose actual position on the substrate deviates from the theoretical or nominal position over successive substrates. The positioning is achieved by first sensing the X and Y offsets of a pair of alignment marks 15A, 15N on the substrate from their theoretical or nominal position to determine the ΔX and ΔY correction factors required to obtain the actual X Y position of the alignment marks. The actual X Y position of the alignment marks is used to determine actual X Y chip position values, ϑ rotation and shrinkage factor corrections required to obtain proper orientation and positioning for batch chip placement.
