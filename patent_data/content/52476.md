## Description
COVERING METHOD BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention This invention relates to an improvement in the covering method for covering the periphery of a joint portion of a pipe, a cable or the like with a covering material comprising a heat shrinkable sheet or tube having a heating conductor wire included therein and a heat fusible adhesive layer on the inner surface of the heat shrinkable sheet or tube. 2 Description of the Prior Art As the conventional covering material having a heating conductor wire embedded therein, there can be mentioned materials disclosed in Japanese Laid Open PatentApplications No. 34903 80 and No. 34904 80 and JapaneseLaid Open Utility Model Applications No. 63723 80,No. 63724 80, No. 79023 80 and No. 79024 80. It is also known that these covering materials have an adhesive layer. Such covering material having a heating conductor wire embedded therein has been proposed as means for covering the periphery of a joint portion of a pipe such as a steel pipe or a cable relatively easily, even when external heating by a flame of a gas burner or the like is difficult to apply as in a cold district or a strong wind district. However, when the periphery of a joint portion of a steel pipe or cable is covered in a cold district with a covering material comprising a heat shrinkable material having a conductor wire embedded therein and a heat fusible adhesive layer bonded to the inner surface of the heat shrinkable material, if only electricity is applied to the conductor wire, various disadvantages arise and no good results can be obtained. For example, it is sometimes impossible to thermally shrink the covering material to the desired extent and bond it to the periphery of the joint.Furthermore, a long time is required for completing thermal shrinkage of the covering material or bonding of the covering material to the periphery of the joint, and the operation efficiency is very low. Moreover, the heat shrinkable material is undesirably degraded or molten because of high temperatures, before the surface of the adhesive layer of the covering material reaches the desired adhesion temperature of the adhesive i.e., an optimn fusion temperature providing the highest adhesion strength , with the result that a covering layer having a sufficient anti corrosive effect cannot be formed on the periphery of the joint. It now has been found that the main causes of the foregoing disadvantages are as follows. First, the conductor wire acting as a heat source is disposed in the central portion of the heat shrinkable material with respect to the thickness direction secondly, both the heat shrinkable material and the heat fusible adhesive layer are composed mainly of synthetic resin materials having a relatively low thermal conductivity and, thirdly, since the surface of the adhesive layer of the covering material is kept in close contact with the surface of the joint of a steel pipe or the like, heat is conducted to the joint, i.e., deprived of by the joint.It is considered, accordingly, that when electricity is applied to the conductor wire, the temperature of the portion of the heat shrinkable material adjacent to the conductor wire as the heat source is first elevated at a high temperafr re rising rate, but the temperature of the adhesive laxer of the covering material, which is located apart from tre heat source and kept in contact with the joint, is not readily elevated and a long time is required for the temperature of the surface of the adhesive layer to reach the adhesion temperature. For example, if a large quantity of an electric current is supplied at a high voltage to the conductcr wire of the covering material arranged around the periphery of a steel pipe or the like in order to avoid the above disadvantage, the temperature of the heat shrinkable material of the covering material is promptly elevated and thermal shrinkage of the heat shrinkable material is completed in a very short time. However, thermal degradation or deterioration of the heat shrinkable material commences or the heat shrinkable material is fused or broken down before the temperature of the surface bonding surface of the adhesive layer of the covering material reaches the desired adhesion temperature, with the result that the anti corrosive action of the covering material is not ensured. Furthermore, when the covering material is disposed around the periphery of the joint of a steel pipe or the like, if a relatively low electric current is applied at such a low voltage so as not to cause thermal deterioration of the heat shrinkable material, the temperature rising rate of the heat shrinkable material is low and uneven thermal shrinkage takes place. Furthermore, in this case, the surface of the adhesive layer does not reach the adhesion temperature of the adhesive, or G very long time is required for the surface of the adhesive layer to reach the adhesion temperature and the operation efficiency is drastically reduced. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to provide a method for forming a covering on the periphery of a joint portion of a steel pipe, a cable or the like, wherein thermal shrinkage of the covering material and bonding of the covering material to the joint portion of a steel pipe or cable can be definitely accomplished without thermal degradation, fusion or breakdown of the covering material, and the covering operation can be completed in a short time. It is another object of the present invention tc provide a method for forming a covering on the periphery of a joint portion of a steel pipe, a cable or the like, which is especially advantageously employed in a cold district. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method for covering a joint portion of a pipe, a cable or the like with a covering material, which comprises the steps of i disposing a covering material comprising a heat shrinkable material having a heating conductor wire embedded therein and a heat fusible adhesive layer on the inner surface of said heat shrinkable material, so that the covering material is wound to form a cylinder around the periphery of said joint portion and then ii supplying electricity in at least two stages of high and middle voltages to the conductor wire of the covering material through a controller capable of continuously performing the operations of a maintaining for a period of shorter than about 20 minutes such a high voltage V1 that the electric power consumption W1 per unit area of the covering material called power consumption rate is 0.75 to 1.5 watt cm2 b changing the high voltage V1 to a middle voltage V2 which provides a power consumption rate W2 of 0.6 to 0.9 x WI watt cm2 and c maintaining said middle voltage V2 until the surface of the adhesive layer reaches an adhesion temperature of the adhesive and then interrupting the application of electricity, whereby the covering material is shrunk and bonded to the periphery of the joint portion. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The method of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a perspective view illustrating an example of the covering material used in the present invention Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing the longitudinal cross section of the covering material shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a diagram illustrating one embodiment in which the covering operation is carried out according to the method of the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The covering material used in the present invention is a flat sheet like or tubular covering material 1 comprising a heat shrinkable material 2 formed of a thermoplastic synthetic resin, a heating conductor wire 3 and 3 embedded throughout the interior of the heat shrinkable material 2 and a heat fusible adhesive layer 4 formed on the entire inner surface i.e., the surface to be brought into contact with the peripheral surface of a joint portion 8 of a steel pipe, a cable or the like of the heat shrinkable material 2. Any materials satisfying the above structural requirements can be used as the covering material in the present invention, and the shape of the covering material is not particularly critical.

This covering material 1 is a sheet having two branched tongue like portions 7a and 7b and 7 a and 7 b on each of both the ends in the direction P of thermal shrinkage, in which heating conductor wires 3 and 3 are embedded in the body portion of the sheet, in the front tongue like portion 7a on one end of the sheet and in the back tongue like portion 7 b on the other end of the sheet, and said heating conductor wires 3 and 3 are arranged in a zigzag manner, as shown in the drawings, so that thermal shrinkage of the entire sheet is permitted, and a heat fusible adhesive layer 4 is formed on the entire inner surface of the sheet. The tongue like portions 7a and 7b and 7 a and 7 b are formed in order to bond both the end portions of the covering material 1 to form a cylinder of the covering material 1 Namely, as shown in Fig. 3, these tongue like portions are engaged with each other and bonded together. Furthermore, in the present invention, there can be used a covering material having an entirely flat sheet like form free of tongue like portions, which tongue like portions are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, on both the ends, in which an adhesive layer is formed on the front side of one end of the flat sheet and on the back side of the other end of the flat sheet, so that both the ends of the sheet can be strongly bonded to each other. There can also be used a double tubular covering material comprising an outer tubular layer of a heat shrinkable material, including a heating conductor wire therein, and an inner tubular layer of a heat fusible adhesive formed on the inner surface of the heat shrinkable material layer. The heat shrinkable material of the covering material may be a heat shrinkable film or sheet prepared by extruding, in the form of a film or sheet, a thermoplastic synthetic resin such as polyethylene, an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride or polyamide drawing the film or sheet at a high temperature cooling the film or sheet in the stretched state to render the film or sheet heat shrinkable and, if necessary to improve the heat resistance or thermal shrinkability, irradiating the film or sheet with radial rays, such as electron beams, to cross link the film or sheet to such an extent that the degree of gel fraction is in the range of from 20 to 70 , preferably 30 to 60 . As the heating conductor wire to be embedded in the covering material, there can be used metal wires composed mainly of metals, such as copper, copper alloys, nickel alloys and chromium alloys, and carbon wires. The kind of the conductor wire is not particularly critical, as long as it generates heat under application of electricity and has good flexibility and softness. From the viewpoint of the flexibility and softness and the heat generating property, it is preferred that a copper wire having a diameter of about 0.01 to about 1.0 mm be used as the conductor wire. In the present invention, it is preferred that the heating conductor wire be embedded and arranged in the covering material so that the electric power consumption per unit area of the covering material i.e., power consumption rate is in the range of from 0.4 to watt cm2 from 2 , more preferably, from 0.45 to 1.8 watt cm under a voltage of about 50 to about 500 volts. A pair of terminals 5 for connection to a power source or controller are preferably provided on the end portions of the conductor wire of the covering material. In the case where the covering material 1 has a pair of tongue like portions on each of both the ends, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, it is preferred that the heating conductor wire 3 embedded in the body portion and the heating conductor wire 3 embedded in the tongue like portions 7a and 7 b should form different circuits and that one end of the conductor wire 3 in the tongue like portion be connected to the terminal 5 of the conductor wire 3 in the body portion and a terminal 6 be provided on the other end of the conductor wire 3 . The adhesive constituting the heat fusible adhesive layer of the covering material may be any adhesive which is composed mainly of a thermoplastic synthetic resin which is neither softened nor becomes stickly at a temperature of not higher than about 500C, especially not higher than about 40 C, and of which an adhesion temperature providing a maximum adhesion strength when cooled to normal temperatures is in the range of from about 80 to about 1500C. The kind and composition of the adhesive are not particularly critical, as long as the above requirements are satisfied. It is preferred that the entire thickness of the covering material be 1 to 6 mm, more preferably about 1.2 to about 5 mm, and the degree of thermal shrinkage of the entire covering material be 20 to 80 , more preferably about 30 to about 60 . According to the covering method of the present invention, at the first step, the above mentioned covering material is disposed so that it winds in the form of a cylinder around a joint portion 8 of a steel pipe or cable, as shown in Fig. 3, and at the second step, electricity is supplied in at least two stages of high and middle voltages to the conductor wire 3 of the covering material 1 through a specific controller C capable of continuously performing the operations of a maintaining a specific high voltage V1 for a period of shorter than about 20 minutes, preferably for a period of 1 to 15 minutes, b changing the high voltage V1 to a specific middle voltage V2 and c maintaining the middle voltage V2 for a specific time and then interrupting the application of electricity, whereby the covering material 1 is thermally shrunk and bonded to the joint portion 8 of the steel pipe or the like. The above mentioned controller C is a kind of a transformer capable of continuously performing, especially automatically, operations of a maintaining for a period of shorter than about 20 minutes, preferably for about 1 to about 15 minutes, such a high voltage V1 that the power consumption rate W1 of the covering material is 0.75 to 1.5 watt cm , preferably 0.8 to 1.4 watt cm2 b changing the high voltage V1 to a middle voltage V2 which provides a 2 power consumption rate W2 of 0.6 to 0.9 x W1 watt cm preferably 0.7 to 0.85 x W1 watt cm , in the covering material, and c maintaining said middle voltage V2 until the surface of the adhesive layer of the covering material reaches an adhesion temperature of the adhesive and then interrupting the application of electricity. In the present invention, it is preferred that the controller C be capable of maintaining an initial voltage V0 providing a power consumption rate of 0.4 to 0.6 x W1 watt cm2 in the covering material for about 0.5 to about 10 minutes, especially about 1 to about 6 minutes, for preheating the covering material before of the high voltage V1 is applied and also of changing this initial voltage V0 to the high voltage V1. The specific times for maintaining the above mentioned voltages can be determined appropriately depending on the thickness of the covering material, the thickness of the steel pipe, the ambient temperature and other factors. If the controller C is connected to a computer D capable of calculating and indicating the respective times when such data are put in the computer D, the above mentioned voltages and the times for maintaining of these voltages can automatically be changed and the operation efficiency can be remarkably increased. Furthermore, there may be adopted a controller C which detects the surface temperature of the heat fusible adhesive layer 4 of the covering material 1 and emits an instruction to stop the application of electricity when the temperature reaches the adhesion temperature. In the present invention, it is preferred that each of the above mentioned voltages be in the range of from 10 to 500 volts, more preferably from 30 to 400 volts. In the present invention, the application of electricity under a high voltage to the conductor wire of the covering material for a long time is not preferred, because the covering material becomes thermally deteriorated or thermally fused or broken. Furthermore, the application of electricity under a low voltage is not preferred, because a long time is then required for completion of thermal shrinkage of the covering material and completion of the bonding operation. One embodiment of the covering method of the present invention, in which the covering material 1 is used, will now be described. At first, the covering material 1 is arranged so that it is wound to form a cylinder around the joint portion 8 of the steel pipe in the state where the tongue like portions 7 and 7 on both the ends of the covering material 1 are engaged with each other, as shown in Fig. 3.Then, the controller C connected to a power source V is connected to the terminal 5 of the heating conductor wire 3 of the covering material 1 and the terminals 6 of the tongue like portions are connected to each other through a switch, and application of electricity is commenced. The controller C used comprises a computer D capable of enabling the controller C to automatically supply voltages V0 , V1 and V2 providing power consumption rates of W0 , W1 and W2 , respectively, in the covering material.Various data are put into this computer D. When the application of electricity from the power source V through the controller C is commenced in the above mentioned state, the initial voltage V0 is first maintained for about 1 to about 10 minutes, so that the power consumption rate No of the covering material is 0.04 to 0.6 x W1 watt cm2, whereby the covering material is preheated and bonding of the tongue like portion 7 is partially completed. Then, the application of electricity is carried out for a period of shorter than about 20 minutes, preferably for a period of shorter than 15 minutes, more preferably for 1 to 10 minutes, under such a high voltage V1 that 12 a power consumption rate N1 of 0.75 to 1.5 watt cm is provided in the covering material, whereby the tongue like portion 7 is completely bonded and the entire covering material is thermally shrunk and brought into close contact with the peripheral surface of the joint portion 8 of the steel pipe. Then, the application of electricity is continuted under such a voltage V2 that a power consumption rate W2 of 0.6 to 0.9 x W1 watt cm2 is provided , whereby the surface of the adhesive layer 4 of the covering material reaches the adhesion temperature of the adhesive, and, when bonding of the covering material to the peripheral surface of the joint portion 8 of the steel pipe is completed, the application of electricity is interrupted. Thus, covering of the peripheral surface of the joint portion 8 of the steel pipe is completed. Incidentally, the application of electricity to the conductor wire 3 of the tongue like portion 7 may be stopped midway during the application of electricity to the conductor wire 3 of the body portion, by means of the switch not shown connecting both terminals 6 of the tongue like portions 7a and 7b to each other, whereby over heating of the tongue like portion 7 is prevented. According to the covering method of the present invention, the covering operation can be completed in a short time, and, furthermore, thermal shrinkage of the covering material and bonding of the covering material to the joint portion of a steel pipe or cable can be definitely accomplished without thermal degradation, fusion or breakdown of the covering material. Therefore, the covering method of the present invention is industrially advantageous and excellent, especially in the case where the covering operation is carried out in a cold district.
