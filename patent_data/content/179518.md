## Description
IUD EXTRACTOR THREAD The present invention relates to an intrauterine device IUD which is provided with a so called extractor thread. It is known and customary for IUD s fitted in the uterus for the purpose of preventing pregnancy to be provided with a so called extractor thread. This extractor thread, which, when the IUD is correctly fitted, has a length such that it is situated partly in the sterile uterus and partly in the non sterile vagina, and ensures that the IUD can, when desired, be rapidly extracted and also makes it substantially simpler to check that the IUD is still in position in the uterus. However, the presence of a thread of this kind also has disadvantages. Bacteriological tests have shown that the occurrence of infections near. at or in the uterus is significantly higher for the wearer of an IUD than in users of other forays of contraception.In addition, it was found that P.I.D. pelvic inflaniatory disease occurred significantly less frequently when use was made of an IUD without an extractor thread than in the case of the use of an IUD with an extractor thread. The conclusion thus appears to be that the extractor thread is in many cases responsible for carrying microorganisms to vulnerable or injured parts. In order to prevent the possibililty of direct infection, it occurs in practice that the doctor fitting the IUD will dip the entireIUD into a solution of an antiseptic The extractor thread of the IUD is then also to a greater of lesser extent impregnated with the antiseptic. The effect of this treatment is however of short duration and is generally too short to justify speaking of an effective long ter treatment. The introduction of an antiseptic, particulary into the vagina and cervix, in this way also increases the likelihood of undesirable side effects through action on the bacteria flora, while the possible systemic effects of an antiseptic applied locally in this manner are also not yet fully known. It has now been found that the problem of the occurrence of infections could be solved in many cases by providing the IUD with an extractor thread which is coated with a thin layer of metallic silver. This extractor thread coated with metallic silver will, during the entire time that the IUD is present in the uterus, prevent infections arising through the carrying of microorganisms from the vagina and cervix , and in this way makes a considerable contribution towards the reduction of the chances of infections. The extractor thread must usually be very thin. It preferably has a diameter not larger than about 0.2 to 0.3 D. In addition, the thread must have a high degree of flexibility and should obviously have a certain strength, which should not or should practically not be affected by a lenghty stay in the cervix and uterus A thin layer of metallic silver doe not influence the flexiblility of the thread, or does so scarcely at all, while the strength of the thread is certainly as great as that of uncoated thread. The core of the thread may be of any suitable material. However, a polymer material meeting the requirements in respect of strength and flexibility is preferably used. Examples of suitable threads which can be provided with a layer of metallic silver include, among others, nylon 6, nylon 66, polyethylene and polypropylene. A nylon thread coated with metallic silver, which can be effectively used for the present invention, is supplied by SwiftTextile Hetalizing Corp., Hartford, Conn., USA. The thread has a total weight of about 40 mg per meter, of which from 3 to 20 consists of metallic silver. The coated thread has an average diameter of about 0.2 ma. The IUD provided with an extractor thread according to this invention may be further improved, if desired, by dipping the entireIUD including the thread into a solution of an antiseptic material just before the insertion of the IUD into the uterus More preferably the IUD is provided with a thin layer or coating consisting essentially of an antiseptic substance contained in a polymeric material. The antiseptic substance will then be released from the polymer either by diffusion or by dissolution of the polymer including the antiseptic in the surrounding body liquid. Said thin layer or coating can be obtained by dipping the IUD in a solution of the polymer material and the antiseptic substance in a suitable liquid such as water or alcohol, followed by removing the solvent from the coating. Preferred antiseptic substances in this respect are benzalkonium chloride, sorbic acid, chlorhexidine and salts thereof, and iodine. Preferred polymers are water soluble polymers such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose HPMC and especially polyvinyl pyrrolidone PVP .
