# A distributed processing telex exchange.

## Abstract
A distributed processing telex switch having different levels of processor control to handle the calls between termi nations connected to the exchange is disclosed. A common control processor 1 occupies the highest level of processor control and function as the system wide manager. Next below common control is a plurality of master control processors 3, 6 which function to switch the command data between com mon control 1 and the lower levels of processor control, and to handle the conversation data generated by each of the terminations connected to the exchange. Connected to each master control processor is a plurality of group control pro cessors 8, 12, 28, 32 which control the flow of data to and from a number of terminations. Associated with each group control processor is a line control processor 10, 14, 30, 34 that cooperates with its associated group control processors to produce the signaling sequences in the terminations and to handle the conversation data from and to the terminations.
