## Description
This invention relates to a novel composition, element and method for the analysis of liquids. In particular, reducible ferric ion chelates and ferrous ion coordinating ligands are used to produce a colored complex in response to a reductant. This invention is particularly useful in clinical chemistry to assay human biological fluids. A large number of clinically and biologically significant substances e.g. enzymes can be quantifiably determined using a reaction or sequence of reactions that generate a detectable reductant such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form identified herein as NADH or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form identified herein as NADPH . Most known assays which monitor either NADH or NADPH do so by directly measuring either the change in absorbance due to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide identified herein as NAD or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate identified herein as NADP when they are reduced, or by measuring the fluorescence change which occurs with that reduction. These known procedures, however, present a number of problems. They are generally highly pH sensitive and subject to considerable error if strict pH control is not maintained. Further, NADH and NADPH are relatively unstable compounds. Also, the sensitivity of such methods is relatively low due to the low extinction of NADH. These methods require the use of complicated optical equipment capable of operating in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum and are subject to interferences which arise in that region. To improve the sensitivity of such assays and to avoid the problems with UV measurements, NAD or NADP reduction has been used with tetrazolium salts to yield formazan dyes. However, formazan dyes also have generally low extinction coefficients and the tetrazolium structures cannot be readily modified to increase the extinction. It is also known to use a ferric ion chelate in an assay which is reduced by NADH to form the corresponding ferrous ion chelate which has different absorption characteristics than its ferric ion counterpart. The ligand used chelates both ferric and ferrous ions. This assay has a serious drawback, however. It is laborious and time consuming since it requires a number of steps for successful completion. For example, enzyme reaction and NADH formation is carried out in solution at a suitable pH. After a desired time 5 20 minutes , the pH is changed by adding an acid or base to stop the enzyme reaction and resulting NADH formation. Simultaneously or subsequently to this, the ferric ion chelate is added to the mixture, and after another lengthy period of time, the resulting change in color of the ferrous ion chelate is measured. This laborious procedure is susceptible to inaccurate results and is not suitable for highly automated clinical procedures. A triglycerides assay is described in U.S. Patent 4,245,041. In this assay, free ferric ions, an electron transfer agent, suitable triglyceride reagents and a ferrous ion chelating agent are mixed in a solution with the liquid sample. In the presence of triglycerides, the reaction sequence produces NADH which then reduces the ferric ions to ferrous ions which coordinate with the chelating agent. The resulting ferrous ion chelate is a colored dye which is easily detected. However, this assay presents a problem because uncomplexed ferric ions remaining in the composition are gradually reduced by undetermined reductants in the assay environment. Hence, the amount of ferrous ion chelate dye formed increases with time, causing inaccurate determinations. Further, if reagent blanks are used in calibrating the spectrophotometer used to measure the dye, the blanks can change with time and the instrument will have to be calibrated frequently. Clearly these disadvantages make this assay undesirable in view of the need for rapid, inexpensive and reliable assays in clinical laboratories today. The problem of ferric ion instability in the triglycerides assay of U.S. Patent 4,245,041 was noted in Japanese Patent Publication 56 153961. This reference teaches the addition of a ferric ion masking agent i.e. a chelating agent to the assay solution to complex with excess ferric ions and to allegedly arrest undesirable ferric ion reduction. This addition occurs after the assay for the analyte has been completed. Use of such a masking agent, however, requires that the assay conditions be carefully tailored so that the masking agent will chelate with the ferric ions. For example, the chelation is highly pH dependent. So, the assay pH and the chelating agent pH must correspond in order for successful masking to occur, or the pH has to be changed when the masking agent is added. This procedure requires an additional step of adding the masking agent after dye formation, thereby complicating the assay and making it less desirable for highly automated analytical procedures. In general, the ferric ion chelates described in the art are formed from weak chelating agents. Therefore, the ferrous ion chelating agents readily complex also with ferric ions, thereby making the ferric ions more easily reducible by reductants that may be present as interferents. The problems noted above with regard to known assays are overcome with a composition for the determination of a reductant in a liquid comprising a chelate of ferric ions and a ferric ion coordinating ligand which chelate produces ferrous ions when reduced, This invention also provides a dry analytical element for the determination of a reductant comprising an absorbent carrier material containing a chelate of ferric ions and a ferric ion coordiating ligand which chelate produces ferrous ions when reduced, Still another feature of this invention is a method for the determination of a reductant in a liquid comprising the steps of The present invention solves the problems noted above using ferric ion chelates which can be reduced to produce ferrous ions which are preferentially complexed with a second coordinating ligand to form a colored complex. Advantageously, the assay of this invention is simple to use both in solution or dry analytical methods , rapid and highly reliable. In particular, it avoids the need to add masking agents after dye formation to stop undesired ferric ion reduction because unused ferric ions remain coordinated in the ferric ion chelate that is used in the assay. Further, the ferric ion chelates are formed from strong chelating agents. Thus, they are not readily reduced by mild reductants that may be present as interferents in the assay. The present invention provides an assay which can be reliably used in highly automated clinical analysis procedures. FIG. 1 is a graphical plot of the activity of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase I.U. 1 x 10 vs. the reaction rate for that enzyme as expressed in change in absorbance per minute measured at 560 nm. This figure is discussed in Example 3 below. FIG. 2 is a graphical plot of reflection density D FIG. 3 is a graphical plot of reflection density D This invention is useful for the determination of any reductant that can reduce Fe III to Fe II . It is particularly useful for the determination of NADH or NADPH, or of analytes that generate NADH or NADPH by one or more enzymatic reactions. Such analytes include living cells e.g. bacteria, yeast or fungi and enzymes such as creatine kinase or dehydrogenases e.g. glucose 6 phosphate dehyrdogenase, lactate dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase . Other analytes that can be detected with this invention are triglycerides, drugs e.g. theophylline, phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin and digoxin , antigens, antibodies or other immunologically reactive substances, enzyme substrates, and others known to one skilled in clinical chemistry. The invention can also be used to detect Fe II produced or left as residue in chemical or biochemical reactions, or occurring in aqueous liquids such as wastewater, ground water or cooling water. The analytical compositions and elements of this invention contain a chelate of ferric ions and a ferric ion coordinating ligand identified herein as LIG₁ , i.e. Fe III LIG₁, which when reduced by a reductant, generates ferrous ions that preferentially coordinate with a ferrous ion coordinating ligand described below to provide a colored complex. LIG₁ is a compound containing one or more ferric ion coordinating ligand sites which complex with the ferric ions. The LIG₁ compounds do not preferentially complex with ferrous ion as compared to ferric ion. Examples of useful ferric ion coordinating ligands include iminodiacetic acid derivatives, LIG₁ can be a polymeric or nonpolymeric compound. Particularly useful nonpolymeric LIG₁ compounds are those having an iminodiacetic acid moiety identified herein as iminodiacetic acid derivatives , such as iminodiacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, N 3 hydroxy 2 pyridylmethyl iminodiacetic acid, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, N benzyliminodiacetic acid, Preferably, LIG₁ is a polymer containing one or more of the ferric ion coordinating moieties described above. Examples of such polymers are those containing the recurring units L is a bivalent linking group such as substituted or unsubstituted alkylene, preferably of 1 to 6 carbon atoms e.g. methylene, ethylene, propylene, tetramethylene , substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkylene, preferably of 5 to 10 carbon atoms in the ring nucleus e.g. cyclopentylene, 1,4 cyclohexylene, 2 chloro 1,4 cyclohexylene , substituted or unsubstituted arylene, preferably of 6 to 10 carbon atoms in the nucleus e.g. In the above polymeric structure, R¹ is a ferric ion coordinating moiety such as CHR⁴COOM₁, or CHR⁴PO₃M₁M₂ wherein R⁴ is hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, preferably of 1 to 6 carbon atoms e.g. methyl, hydroxymethyl, ethyl, hexyl, etc. , and M₁ and M₂ are independently suitable monovalent cations, such as hydrogen, an alkali metal or ammonium. More preferably, R¹ is CHR⁴COOM₁ and R⁴ is hydrogen. Other useful polymeric LIG₁ compounds include In addition, useful polymers include nitrogen containing polymers quaternized with alkylating groups having appended ferric ion coordinating moieties, particularly polymers having recurring units of the structure Another class of polymers containing ferric ion coordinating moieties are active methylene group containing polymers i.e. polymers having pendant Particularly preferred polymers containing moieties which will coordinate with ferric ions are polymers comprising from about 5 to 100 weight percent of the recurring units having the structure The LIG₁ compounds described above are either commercially available or prepared by one skilled in synthetic chemistry using known starting materials and procedures. For example, details of preparation of the described polymers are given in The polymers described above can also contain up to 95 weight percent, but preferably up to 50 weight percent, of recurring units derived from one or more polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers other than the monomers described above. Such monomers include, styrene and related aromatic monomers, acrylic and methacrylic acids and esters, vinyl amides, sulfoalkyl acrylic esters and amides and others within the skill of a polymer chemist. In the context of this application, the term coordinate refers to the sharing of electron pairs by the ferric or ferrous ions and the LIG₁ or LIG₂ compound, respectively. The stability constant for the respective chelates can be determined by known procedures noted in Ferric ions and LIG₁ form a suitable chelate when mixed in a suitable vessel. Chelation generally proceeds at ambient temperatures and without the aid of a catalyst. The composition of this invention optionally, but preferably, includes an electron transfer agent identified herein as ETA which can transfer electrons from the reductant to the ferric ions of the ferric ion chelate. In general, the ETA has a reduction potential E ETA compounds useful in the practice of this invention include phenazine methosulfate, phenazine methosulfate, and similar compounds, and substituted benzoquinones and naphthoquinones. Combinations of different ETA compounds can be used if desired. The composition of this invention further comprises a ferrous ion coordinating ligand identified herein as LIG₂ which is a compound which preferentially complexes with ferrous ions to form a colored complex. Generally, the colored complexes so formed absorb electromagnetic radiation in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e. between 400 and 700 nm. More than one molecule of LIG₂ can complex with a single ferrous ion. These LIG₂ compounds do not form chelates with ferric ions to any appreciable extent. Useful nonpolymeric LIG₂ compounds are ferroine, cuproine and terroine type compounds such as those described by Smith in The nonpolymeric LIG₂ compounds can have a ballast group which renders it nondiffusible in an analytical element during the assay. Useful ballast groups are generally organic groups of such molecular size and configuration as to render the compound nondiffusable in an element. Particularly useful groups include long chain substituted or unsubstituted alkyl groups e.g. 6 to 30 carbon atoms , as well as aromatic groups phenyl, naphthyl along with alkyl groups. Representative ballast groups include Alternatively, the LIG₂ compound can be a polymer chain which has one or more ferrous ion coordinating moieties attached to the polymer backbone in a suitable manner. These polymers are generally bulky enough to be immobile in a coated layer, i.e. they are self ballasting. Polymers to which ferrous ion coordinating moieties can be attached are those having reactive groups that readily react with complementary reactive groups on a nonpolymeric LIG₂ compound or are polymerized from monomers containing such moieties. For example, groups which easily undergo condensation reactions are quite useful. Acid derivatives including free carboxylic acids, acid chlorides and anhydrides readily condense with hydroxy, amine, and mercapto groups to split out small molecules and form the desired monomer or polymer condensation product. The same can be accomplished with addition reactions, e.g. a hydroxy or amine group adds readily to an isocyanate group to form urethane or urylene linkages, or an activated unsaturated group acryloyl adds readily to an amine group, or by any other reactions known in the art. The monomers can then be polymerized to form the polymers using conventional polymerization techniques. Thus, any polymers or monomers, preferably vinyl polymers or monomers, containing requisite reactive groups complementary to reaction groups on the nonpolymeric LIG₂ compound to be attached to the polymer are useful in forming polymeric LIG₂ compounds or monomers useful in making same. Polymers and monomers containing carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid halides, carboxylic acid anhydride, sulfonic acid, hydroxy, epoxy, amino, isocyanate, etc. groups are especially useful. More specifically, copolymers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic anhydride, 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, have useful reactive groups. The preparation and properties of such polymers are given in various polymer textbooks such as M. P. Stevens Particularly useful LIG₂ compounds polymeric or nonpolymeric have one or more coordinating moieties which are represented by the structure In this structure, m is 0 or a positive integer of 1 to 3, n and p are independently 0 or 1, and R , R¹², R¹³, R¹⁴, R¹⁵ and R¹⁶ are independently hydrogen, amino primary, secondary or tertiary , hydroxy, mercapto, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy preferably of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g. methoxy, chloromethoxy, ethoxy, octyloxy, alkoxy substituted with imino , substituted or unsubstituted alkyl preferably of 1 to 20 carbon atoms in the nucleus, e.g. methyl, ethyl, chloromethyl, isopropyl, When R¹⁶ is a group defined above, p is 1 and Alternatively, if m is 0, R and R¹², R¹² and R¹³, and R¹³ and R¹⁴, taken together, can independently represent the carbon atoms and heteroatoms e.g. nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, selenium, etc. necessary to complete a substituted or unsubstituted 5 to 20 membered mono or polycyclic heterocyclic nucleus e.g. pyridyl, quinolyl, triazinyl, phenanthrolinyl, pyrimidyl . R¹² and R¹³, taken together, can also represent the carbon atoms necessary to complete a substituted or unsubstituted 5 to 20 membered mono or polycyclic carbocyclic nucleus e.g. phenyl, naphthyl . The nucleus so formed can be substituted with one or more oxo, alkyl, amino, imino, aryl, phosphino e.g. diphenylphosphino , alkoxy, amide, sulfonamide, thio or sulfo groups as defined above or a heterocyclic group e.g. pyridyl, pyrimidyl, thiazolyl, imidazolyl, thienyl . If m is 1, 2 or 3, R and R¹², R¹⁵ and R¹⁶ and R¹³ and R¹⁴, taken together, can represent the carbon and heteroatoms e.g. nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, selenium, etc. necessary to complete a substituted or unsubstituted 5 to 20 membered mono or polycyclic heterocyclic nucleus as defined above where m is 0. When R¹⁵ and R¹⁶ are so defined, p is 0 when Examples of useful nonpolymeric LIG₂ compounds which form colored complexes with ferrous ions include the following the λ Polymers useful as LIG₂ compounds are represented by the following structure The first LIG₂ compound illustrated above ferrozine is preferred in the practice of this invention. The LIG₂ compounds useful in the practice of this invention can be either obtained commercially or prepared using starting materials and techniques known in the art. The analytical composition of this invention can be used in both solution and dry element assays to detect or quantify an analyte e.g. defined above . Reductants which can be determined with this invention include NADH, NADPH, flavin adenine dinucleotide reduced form , flavin mononucleotide reduced form , thiols, such as dithiothreitol, dithioerythritol and 2 mercaptoethanol, and living cells, such as yeast and bacteria. The analytical composition can be prepared for use in a solution assay by mixing the Fe III LIG₁ chelate, the LIG₂ compound, and optionally the ETA, in water. The details of preparing a representative analytical composition are given in Example 1 below. Other optional components can also be included in the compositions, including buffers, surfactants, interactive compositions described below . When the compositions of this invention are used in solution assays, generally the Fe III LIG₁ chelate is present in a concentration of up to 10, and preferably from 0.06 to 1.2, mg ml of solution. When used, the ETA is present in an amount up to 0.3, and preferably from 5 x 10 ⁴ to 0.01, mg ml. The LIG₂ compound is generally present in an amount up to 20, and preferably from 0.5 to 5, mg ml. When NADH or NADPH are determined in response to the presence of another analyte in the assayed sample, the corresponding oxidized form, NAD or NADP, is generally added to the solution in an amount to provide up to 10, and preferably from 0.2 to 2.5, mg ml. The amounts of the other optional composition components e.g. buffer, surfactant, etc. and of the interactive composition described below are readily determined by one skilled in the clinical chemistry art. The compositions of this invention can be used to determine an analyte which is capable of producing NADH or NADPH by a reaction or series of reactions by including an interactive composition in such compositions which produces the reductant. Analytes which can be determined in this manner include triglycerides, dehydrogenases, creatine kinase, and others known to one skilled in the clinical chemistry art. The composition of this invention can also be used in competitive binding assays for determining immunologically reactive substances. This invention is adaptable to both solution and dry element assays. In a solution assay, generally the Fe III LIG₁ chelate, ETA if used , LIG₂ compound and interactive composition if included are physically contacted and mixed with a liquid test sample in a suitable container e.g. test tube, petrie dish, beaker, cuvette, etc. . The resulting solution can be incubated, if desired, for a suitable time at a suitable temperature. The sample is then evaluated by measuring the amount of colored complex produced upon coordination of LIG₂ and ferrous ions. The amount of colored complex detected can be correlated to the amount of reductant e.g. NADH or NADPH either initially present in the sample, or produced as a result of the presence of an analyte. Such an evaluation can be done visually or with suitable colorimetric detection equipment and procedures. Alternatively, the composition and method of this invention can be utilized with a dry analytical element which comprises an absorbent carrier material e.g. a thin sheet of a self supporting absorbent or bibulous material, such as filter paper or paper test strips and the components of the composition described above. Such elements can also contain an interactive composition for the analyte. These elements are known in the art as test strips, diagnostic elements, dip sticks, diagnostic agents and the like. When employed in dry analytical elements, the composition components can be incorporated into the absorbent carrier material by imbibition, impregnation, coating or another suitable technique. Useful absorbent carrier materials are insoluble and maintain their structural integrity when exposed to water or physiological fluids such as urine or serum. Useful absorbent carrier materials can be prepared from paper, porous particulate structures, porous polymers, cellulose, wood, glass fiber, woven and nonwoven fabrics synthetic and nonsynthetic and the like. A useful dry analytical element is made by imbibing a solution of the composition into the material and drying. Details for making such elements are well known in the art, as exemplified in U.S. Patents 3,092,465, 3,802,842, 3,915,647, 3,917,453, 3,936,357, 4,248,829, 4,255,384, and 4,270,920, and U.K. Patent 2,052,057. Preferably, the dry analytical elements of this invention have at least one porous spreading zone as the carrier material. This zone, alone or with other zones, can be self supporting i.e. composed of a material rigid enough to maintain its integrity , but preferably it is carried on a non porous support. Such a support can be any suitable dimensionally stable, and preferably, transparent i.e. radiation transmissive material which transmits electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength between 200 and 900 nm. A support of choice for a particular element should be compatible with the intended mode of detection reflection or transmission spectroscopy . Useful support materials include paper, metal foils, polystyrene, polyesters e.g. poly ethylene terephthalate , polycarbonates, cellulose esters e.g. cellulose acetate , etc. The porous spreading zone can be prepared from any suitable fibrous or non fibrous material or mixtures of either or both. The void volume and average pore size of this zone can be varied depending upon the use intended. Useful spreading zones can be prepared using materials described in U. S. Patents 4,292,272, 3,992,158, 4,258,001 and 4,430,436 and Japanese Patent Publication 57 1982 101760. It is desirable that the spreading zone be isotropically porous, meaning that the porosity is the same in each direction in the zone as created by interconnected spaces or pores between particles, fibers, polymeric strands, etc. The elements can have more than one zone, e.g. one or more reagent zones, spreading zones, registration zones, mordant zones, radiation blocking or light filtering zones, subbing zones, barrier zones, buffer zones, etc. The zones are generally in fluid contact with each other meaning that fluids, reagents and reaction products can pass between superposed regions of adjacent zones unless the zones are designed to inhibit the passing of certain materials. Preferably, the zones are separately coated superposed layers, although two or more zones can be a single layer. The components of the compositions of this invention, i.e. Fe III LIG₁ chelate, ETA if present LIG₂ compound, interactive composition if present , and other optional components can be incorporated in any of the zones of the elements that would be suitable for the particular analysis. For example, a mordant may be useful in the zone containing the resulting dye to reduce its tendency to wander. The location of individual components is within the skill of a worker in the clinical chemistry art. In the elements of this invention, the amount of the FE III LIG₁ chelate can be varied widely, but it is generally present in a coverage of up to 10, and preferably from about 0.2 to 2 g m². The ETA if used is present in a coverage of up to 1, and preferably from 0.01 to 0.1 g m². The LIG₂ compound is generally present in an amount of up to 10, and preferably from 0.2 to 2, g m². When NADH and NADPH are the reductants being determined in response to an analyte, the corresponding oxidized forms, NAD or NADP are generally present in the element in an amount of up to 8, and preferably from 0.3 to 2.5, g m². A variety of other desirable, but optional reagents and addenda can be present in the element in amounts known to one skilled in the art. Such materials include surfactants, buffers, binders, pigments, activators, mordants, subbing materials and reagents for the interactive compositions. One embodiment of this invention is a multilayer dry analytical element for determining an analyte. This element comprises a support having thereon, in order and in fluid contact, a registration layer containing a hydrophilic binder material natural or synthetic , such as gelatin or polyacrylamide, and a porous spreading layer. The element also comprises 1 an interactive composition which produces NADH or NADPH upon interaction with the analyte, 2 a Fe III LIG₁ chelate as described above, 3 an ETA as described above, and 4 a LIG₂ compound as described above. This element can also include a mordant layer between the registration and spreading layers. This layer can contain one or more polymeric mordants, such as those described in U.S. Patent 4,166,093. A variety of different elements, depending on the method of assay, can be prepared in accordance with the present invention. Elements can be configured in a variety of forms, including elongated tapes of any desired width, sheets, slides or chips. The assay of this invention can be manual or automated. In using the dry elements, the determination is made by taking the element from a supply roll, chip packet or other source and physically contacting it with a sample e.g. 1 100µl of the aqueous liquid to be tested so that the sample and the reagents in the element are mixed. Such contact can be accomplished in any suitable manner, e.g. dipping or immersing the element into the sample or, preferably, by spotting the element by hand or machine with a drop of the sample with a suitable dispensing means. After sample application, the element is exposed to any conditioning, such as incubation, heating or the like, that may be desirable to quicken or otherwise facilitate obtaining any test result. Determination of the reductant e.g. NADH, NADPH or an analyte is achieved when the LIG₂ compound coordinates with ferrous ions to provide a detectable colored complex. This complex can be detected visually or with suitable spectrophotometric means and procedures. The following Examples illustrate the practice of this invention. Several Fe III LIG₁ chelates were used in solution assays to determine NADH in the following manner. A 2 millimolar stock solution of NADH was diluted to obtain samples of stock solutions having NADH concentrations ranging from 0.031 to 0.2 millimolar. Each of these solutions was then diluted 1 20 in 0.1 molar KH₂PO₄ buffer pH 6.5 and the absorbance of NADH was determined using a known spectrophotometer at 340 nm. Three sets of solutions were prepared as follows, each having a different LIG₁ N 3 hydroxy 2 pyridylmethyl iminodiacetic acid LIG₁ , ferrozine LIG₂ and Fe NO₃ ₃ 9H₂0 were dissolved in distilled water to achieve solution having concentrations of 0.24 mg mℓ 1 millimolar , 2.55 g mℓ 5 millimolar and 0.4 mg mℓ 1 millimolar , respectively. This solution was prepared the same as Solution 1, except that LIG₁ was diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Gentle heating or sonication was used to improve dissolution of LIG₁. Poly N All of the above chelate solutions were diluted 1 5 with water. A 50 µl sample of each NADH stock solution was diluted 1 20 with each diluted chelate solution to form an assay solution. Diluted chelate solutions without NADH were used as Controls. A 50 µl sample of 0.2 millimolar phenazine methosulfate ETA was added to 950 µl of each assay solution and the absorbances A of the resulting mixtures were measured at 560 nm with a spectrophotometer. The absorbance of a Control solution no ferrozine was subtracted from the absorbance of each assay solution. The data obtained are presented in Table I below. Much higher absorbances were obtained using ferrozine registration at 560 nm of NADH with various Fe III LIG₁ compounds as compared to direct NADH detection at 340 nm. These results demonstrate the advantage of the present invention with several Fe III LIG₁ compounds. This example demonstrates the use of several LIG₂ compounds to determine NADH An aqueous ferric chelate solution containing 0.001 molar N 3 hydroxy 2 pyridylmethyl iminodiacetic acid LIG₁ and 0.001 molar Fe NO₃ ₃ 9H₂O was prepared. To separate 5 ml aliquots of this solution was added each of the LIG₂ ligands A, B, C, and D identified above to achieve an assay solution having a LIG₂ concentration of 0.005 molar. During LIG₂ addition, the pH of the solution was kept below 6.0. Compound C was first dissolved in 5 ml of 20 pyridine prior to the addition of 5 ml of the above chelate solution. All of the assay solutions were subsequently diluted to 25 ml with distilled water. Blank solutions without LIG₂ were also prepared for background measurements. To perform the assay, 50 µl of each NADH stock solution 2 millimolar to 0.003 millimolar prepared as in Example 1 and 50 µl of 0.2 millimolar phenazine methosulfate ETA were added to 900 µℓ of each of the above solutions. Control solutions lacking NADH were also prepared. The absorbance of each assay solution was measured at the wavelengths indicated in Table II for each LIG₂ compound. The absorbances were corrected by subtracting the absorbance of a control solution without LIG₂. The data of Table II indicate that all of the LIG₂ compounds were useful for NADH determination although maximum response was obtained with compounds A and C. This example demonstrates the determination of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase with the present invention. An aqueous reagent solution containing 0.005 molar ferrozine LIG₂ , 0.001 molar N 3 hydroxy 2 pyridylmethyl iminodiacetic acid LIG₁ , and 0.001 molar Fe NO₃ ₃ 9H₂O was prepared. This solution was diluted 1 5 with an aqueous solution containing 7 millimolar MgCl₂, 2 millimolar glucose 6 phosphate, and 1 millimolar NAD and its pH was adjusted to 7.0. A solution of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase 842 I.U. 1 was serially two fold diluted to yield solutions containing enzyme activity ranging from 842 to 26 I.U. 1. Fifty microliters of each enzyme solution and 50 µl of 0.2 millimolar phenazine methosulfate ETA were added to separate 900 µl aliquots of the above chelate solution. The change in absorbance at 560 nm was measured for each solution. A graph of enzyme activity plotted against enzyme rate as measured by absorbance change A₅₆₀ min is shown in FIG. 1. In the context of this disclosure, I.U. represents the International Unit for enzyme activity defined as one I.U. being the amount of enzyme activity required to catalyze the conversion of 1 micromole of substrate per minute under standard pH and temperature conditions for the given enzyme. Enzyme activity can be measured using conventional procedures. The data presented in FIG. 1 clearly demonstrate the utility of the method of the present invention for enzyme analysis. A dry analytical element was prepared according to the present invention for determination of NADH. This element had the format and components as illustrated below.
