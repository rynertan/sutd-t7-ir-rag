# Pull out fusible switches.

## Abstract
Assembly systems for compact No pole fusible pull out switches of different ratings use the same two part insulator bases 31,40 and the same insulator pull out heads in all switches. In one system, for switches of a given current rating but two different voltage ratings, there are two types of fixed contacts 80,80 in the base 31 but the contacts are the same for both voltage ratings the fuseholder stab contact mem bers in the head are the same for both switch ratings. The voltage ratings are differentiated from each other only by different base terminals 37 and by different insulator bar riers 88 over the base contacts. In another system, different current ratings and different voltage ratings are differentiated from each other only by different fixed contacts in the base, by different fuseholder stab members in the head, and by different insulator barriers. Both systems preclude misas sembly and misapplication in the field. A particularly compact fuseholder stab contruction is provided for high current rat ings.
