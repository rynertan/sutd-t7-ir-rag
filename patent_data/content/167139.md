Salmonella typhosa.Pseudomonas and Bacterium Proteus. The antibacterials of the invention are not limited to utility as medicaments they may be used in all manner of industry. for example additives to animal feed. preservation of food, disinfectants. and in other industrial systems where control of bacterial growth is desired. For example. they may be employed in aqueous compositions in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 parts of antibiotic per million parts of solution in order to destroy or inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria on iaedical and dental equipment and as bactericides in industrial applications. for example in waterbased paints and in the white water of paper mills to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. The compounds of this invention may be used in any of a variety of pharmaceutical preparations.They may be employed in capsule, powder form. in liquid solution, or in suspension. They may be administered by a variety of means those of principal interest include topically or parenterally by injection intravenously or intramuscularly . Compositions for injection. a preferred route of delivery. may be prepared in unit dosage form in ampules. or in multidose containers. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions.solutions. or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles.and may contain formulatory agents. Alternatively.the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution. at the time of delivery. with a suitable vehicle, such as sterile water. Topical applications may be formulated in hydrophobic or hydrophilic bases as ointments. creams, lotions.paints. or powders. The dosage to be administered depends to a large extent upon the condition and size of the subject being treated as well as the route and frequency of administration the parenteral route by injection being preferred for generalized infections. Such matters. however1 are left to the routine discretion of the therapist according to principles of treatment well known in the antibiotic art. In general. a daily dosage consists of from about 5 to about 600 mg of active ingredient per kg of body weight of the subject in one or more treatments per day. A preferred daily dosage for adult humans lies in the range of from about 10 to 240 mg of active ingredient per kg of body weight.Another factor influencing the precise dosage regimen. apart from the nature of the infection and peculiar identity of the individual being treated. is the molecular weight of the chosen species of this invention I . The compositions for human delivery per unit dosage. whether liquid or solid. may contain from 0.1z to 995 of active material. the preferred range being from about 10 60t. The composition will generally contain from about 15 mg to about 1500 mg of the active ingredient however. in general. it is preferable to employ a dosage amount in the range of from about 250 mg to 1000 mg. In parenteral administration, the unit dosage is usually the pure compound I in sterile water solution or in the form of a soluble powder intended for solution. The preferred method of administration of the formula I antibiotic is parenteral by i.v. infusion. i.v. bolus, or i.. injection. For adults, 5 50 mg of Formula I antibiotic per kg of body weight given 2, 3, or 4 times per day is preferred. Preferred dosage is 250 mg to 1000 mg of the Formula I antibiotic given two b.i.d. three t.i.d. or four q.i.d. times per day. More specifically, for mild infections, and particularly urinary tract infections, a dose of 250 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is recommended. For moderate infections against highly susceptible gram positive and gram negative organisms. a dose of 500 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d.is recommended. For severe. life threatening infections against organisms at the upper limits of sensitivity to the antibiotic, a dose of 1000 t.i.d.or q.i.d. is recommended. For children. a dose of 5 25 mg kg of body weight given 2, 3, or 4 times per day is preferred a dose of 10 mg kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. is usually recommended. Antibiotic compounds of Formula I are of the broad class known as carbapenems or l carbade thiapenems. Certain of these carbapenems are susceptible to attack by a renal enzyme known as dëhydropeptidase DHP . This attack or degradation may reduce the efficacy of the carbapenem antibiotic.Inhibitors of DHP and their use vith carbapenem antibiotics are disclosed in the prior art tsee published European Patent Applications No.79102615.6. filed July 24, 1979 application no.15573 and No. 82107174.3. filed August 9. 1980 application no. 72014 . The present I compounds may. where DHP inhibition is desired or necessary. be combined or used with the appropriate DHP inhibitor as described in the aforesaid published applications. Thus, to the extent that the cited European patent applications 1. define the procedure for determining DHP susceptibility of the present carbapenems and 2. disclose suitable inhibitors, combination compositions and methods of treatment, they are incorporated berein by reference. A preferred weight ratio of I compound DHP inhibitor in the combination compositions is about 1 1. A preferred DP inhibitor is 7 L 2 amino 2 carboxyethylthio 2 2,2 dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxamide 2 heptenoic acid or a useful salt thereof. These combination compositions and their use is another embodiment of the present invention. The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by any convenient process.A. One such process is illustrated in the following reaction equations EMI25.1 EMI26.1 wherein Z is a leaving group such as OPO O 2. EMI26.2 and the like, X is a leaving group such as Br. I, OSO2CF3.EMI26.3 or X is an anionic group such as BP4, SbF5, PF6 and the like and R0 is a protecting group such as p nitrobenzyl or allyl.R . L and R4 are as defined above. The side chain addition reaction is carried out in a solvent such as acetonitrile.dimethylformamide. dimethylacetamide or N ethylpyrrolidinone in the presence of a base such as N,N disopropylethylamine, triethylamine or 4 dimethylaminopyridine at a temperature of from 40 C to 25 C for a period of five minutes to ten hours. The alkylation reaction is conducted in a solvent such as dichloromethane, dimethylformamide.acetonitrile or dimethylacetamide at a temperature of from 20 C to 250C for a period of 1 to 24 hours.The deblocking reaction wherein Rb is p nitrobenzyl is usually conducted in an aqueous system containing cosolvents such as tetrahydrofuran, ethanol. n butanol, I amyl alcohol. or ethyl acetate and a pH 6.8 to 7.0 aqueous buffer. Suitable buffers include phosphate buffers and buffers derived from nonnucleophilic amines such as N methylmorpholine or morpholinopropane sulfonic acid. The reaction is conducted at O C to 40 C for 0.5 to 5 hours under 1 100 atmospheres of hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as 10t palladium on carbon or 20z palladium hydroxide on carbon. The final products are purified by ion exchange chromatography and or reverse phase chromatography. When a pharmaceutically acceptable ester of the final product is desired. the deblocking step is omitted and the appropriate R group is incorporated into the starting material. B. A second process is illustrated by the following set of equations EMI28.1 wherein Z. X. L, RO, R3 and and R4 are as defined above. The difference between the above process and that earlier described is that the side chain moiety is alkylated with the group R3 prior to addition to the carbapenem nucleus. The side chain addition step and deblocking are conducted as described above. A A third process is illustrated by the following set of equations EMI29.1 EMI30.1 wherein Z. X, L. R . R3 and R 4 are as previously defined. In this case the 2 mercapto intermediate is generated from the activated carbapenem upon exposure to sodium hydrosulfide in dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide at a temperature of from 500C to 20 C for a period of five minutes to one hour.The sulfur atom is alkylated in a solvent such as acetonitrile. dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide or the like in the presence of a base such as N,N diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine or the like at a temperature of from 400C to 250C for a period of from ten minutes to eight hours. The side chain alkylation, removal of R and purification of I is conducted as described above. D. A A fourth process is illustrated by the following set of equations EMI31.1 wherein Z, X. RO. R3, and R4 are as previously defined. The difference between this process and that described in process C is that the side chain moiety is alkylated with the group R3 prior to addition to the carbapenem nucleus. The side chain addition step and the deblocking are conducted as described above. The following examples illustrate the preparation of compounds of Formula I.
