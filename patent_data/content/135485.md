## Description
P9DCESS AND APPARATUS FOR SUPERFICIAL TREATMENT OF CYLJNDRICAL BODIES,IN PARTICULAR FOR PAINTING OPERATION. This invention relates to a new process and apparatus for surface treating cylindrical bodies, in particular for effecting a painting operation thereon. Surface treating of cylindrical bodies, such as, for example, metal barrels provided or not with a bottom or cover, water heater shells and the like, comprising, in particular, subssecting the bodies to a spray operation in order to externally or internally apply a paint thereon with the aid of manual or automatic devices, is normally performed in a spray booth in which appropriate spray devices are provided and into which the bodies to be treated are introduced after having caused them to divert from their line of production to which the bodies are brought back once the process is carried out. During process, said bodies are driven in rotation so as to uniformly treat them over their entire surface.Moreover, it is of great importance that the contact regions of said bodies with the holding and conveying means should be minimized thereby to prevent the contacted surfaces from being not thoroughly processed. According to a conventional technique utilizing apparatus known, provided inside a painting booth is a rolling device consisting of a number of generally truncated cone shaped rolls of horizontally directed axis, onto which the cylindrical bodies which also are disposed with horizontally directed axis are charged and then driven in rotation. In this way, the painting process becomes a long operation due to the idle times that are needed for having the drive rolls, and the cylindrical bodies carried thereon, set in rotation, for stopping this rotation following completion of the painting process and for effecting the translation operations in order to charge and discharge the cylindrical bodies. A further disadvantage of the above conventional technique is the friction phenomenon that is caused to occur upon charging the barrels onto the rolling device, with the risk of spark formation dangerous in a painting room if the rolling device is not stopped in due time. Apparatus have furthermore been proposed which provide for conveying the cylindrical bodies and driving them in rotation, while lying with vertically directed axis, the bodies being held in suspended position by the aid of gripping means that engage upper portions of said bodies. These systems, too, have a number of disadvantages, in particular in that the suspended bodies are likely to swing and oscillate, which hinders a good painting operation. Practically, these apparatus have found very little application indeed. This invention provides a new process, and a related apparatus, for the surface treating of cylindrical bodies, in particular for spray painting both the internal and external faces of said bodies, these new process and apparatus being so designed as to eliminate the disadvantages that are connected with the conventional technique. The process is essentially characterized in that it provides for translating the cylindrical bodies in order to have them supplied to, and discharged from, a rolling or revolving device within a painting booth, said cylindrical bodies being made to be set in rotation and to be maintained in rotating condition with respect to their own axis which is vertically directed.More specifically, the process of the invention comprises the steps effected in a sequential manner at a corresponding number of operative stations of removing cylindrical bodies from a respective line of production, causing said cylindrical bodies to be set in rotation about their vertical axis and at an adjustable speed, subjecting the cylindrical bodies, while rotating about their vertical axis, to a process operation, in particular a spray painting operation, slowing down and braking rotation of the bodies, and discharging the processed bodies back to the respective line of production. The apparatus for carrying out the above process is characterized in that it comprises a series of rotating and conveying means which are able to engage the cylindrical bodies at their lower base by making reduced contact areas therewith, and to drive the cylindrical bodies in rotation, the conveying means being so designed as to keep the cylindrical bodies rotating during their translation. A primary advantage that is achived by the process and apparatus according to this invention is that they significantly reduce the idle times for starting the rolling device at each processing cycle, which results in incresaig process efficiency up to values of 4 c to 5 , as compared with the processes of the conventional technique. A further advantage is the greater safety that. is ensured due to the absence or substantial reduction of the friction phenomena between the rotating cylindrical bodies and the rotating members of the rolling device, which permits spark formation in the processing booth, and, thus, the resultant danger of fire, to be prevented.The fact of having the cylindrical bodies disposed with their axis directed vertically in the painting booth, as provided by the process according to the invention, further allows for the paint spray guns to be disposed in a vertical, outwardly directed position in which said spray guns are more accessible and easier to reach for maintenance purposes. Further features and advantages of the process and apparatus of the invention will appear from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof, which is shown, by way of a non restrictive example, on the accompanying drawings and which is related to a paint spray plant for spray painting cylindrical bodies, in particular metal barrels or shells. In the drawingss Figure 1 is a block diagram schematically showing a painting process Figure 2 is a front view of said plant Figure 3 is a plan view of the plant in figure 2 and Figure 4 is a detail front view showing a rotating unit on a greater scale. With reference to the above figures, the block diagram in figure shows the station A in which a vertically disposed barrel having been removed from a production line L by conveying means of a conventional type , is driven in rotation about its vertical axis, is lifted, and is translated while being kept rotating to the station B in which a painting operation is carried out on the barrel which is disposed vertically and is rotating about its vertical axis. When the painting operation is completed, the barrel is lifted and is moved, without its rotation being stopped, to the slowing down and braking station C from which the processed barrel is discharged, by conveying means of a conven tional.type to a production line L . The process takes place in sequence so that as soon as a processed barrel is carried away from the processing station 3, a new barrel is charged into it without disrupting operations for stopping the rolling device and driving it again in rotation. As shown in figures 2 3 and in detail view, figure 4, the processing plant comprises a first rotating unit formed of a set of three rolls 1 of truncated cone shape and having a base 2 of increased diameter in order to afford an abutment surface for the lower face 3 of the vertically directed axis barrel 4 to bear against. The vertically directed axis rolls 1 are powered, adjustable speed rolls and are designed to drive the barrel 4 in rotation.Said rolls are circumferentially spaced apart by distances that, are of, advantageously, 120. see figure 3 . Similar rotary units having rolls 11 1 are provided in the two subsequent processing and braking stations B C respectively, and serve to support the barrel 4 therein and to drive it in rotation. The rolls 1 n in station C are idle rollers. Further provided are two translation units each of which consistsof a set of three rotary rolls 5 5 , respectively, that have a vertically directed axis and are of the same shape as the rolls 1 1t 1 are.These rolls 5 5 are angularly offset as seen in plan view, figure 3 with respect to rolls 1 1 1 , and are powered rolls designed to be movable both vertically and horizontally such that wnen displaced in a vertical direction, said rolls 5 5 will engage the barrel 4 to lift it from the potion in which the barrel is bearing on the rotary rolls 1 1t, whereas, when displaced in an horizontal direction, said rolls 5 5t cause the barrel 4 to be translated while being kepf rotating from station A to station B and from station B to station C, respectively. Following each barrel translation, the rolls are moved back to their starting positions for a next cycle. The processing station B may advantageously comprise a plurality of similar processing stations in order to have different stages of the painting operation carried out in a separate manner.
