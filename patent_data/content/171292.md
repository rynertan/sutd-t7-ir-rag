## Description
The present invention relates to semiconductor memory devices manufactured by the master slice method, and more particularly but not exclusively it relates to emitter coupled logic ECL type memory devices. Semiconductor memory devices such as ECL memory devices using bipolar transistors have been made with increasingly larger capacities in recent years. This has been accompanied by an increase of the load of word lines. To deal with this increased load, it is effective to form a driver circuit for the word lines in a two stage emitter follower EF construction or a darlington connection to raise the drive capacity. This enables higher speed operation and lower power consumption. Semiconductor memory devices such as ECL memory devices come in two types, 10K and 100K . The input and output levels of these may be almost the same, but their temperature characteristics may be different. That is, the 10K type may have a temperature coefficient the same as that of a forward voltage V Another difference between the two types lies in the voltage of the power source. An ECL memory device operates between an earth potential V The only difference in the conventional circuit constructions of the 100K and 10K types of memory device is that the 100K type provides a diode in an output buffer gate for compensating for the temperature characteristic of the output voltage and another diode for adjusting the threshold level of an input buffer gate due to receiving constant voltage swings. Therefore, 100K and 10K types can be manufactured by almost the same wafer process the additional diodes are always prepared fabricated and to manufacture the 100K type the wiring process is changed to add the diodes in those circuits. This method is called the master slice method. When a word line driver is constructed in two stages, the voltages of the word lines become low and the total levels are supplied to word lines and bit lines become low corresponding to a voltage drop of the word lines. This makes disadvantageous the power source margin in the 100K type, which must be operated by a relatively shallow supply voltage e.g. around 4.5V. Actually, most memory devices which have two stage word drivers cannot operate at 4.5V. This means that the word line driver in a 100K type must be constructed as a one stage word driver. When using the master slice method and conventional circuit technology, therefore, even the 10K type must have a word driver constructed in one stage. This, however, means high speed operation cannot be obtained even with a 10K type despite its sufficient power source margin. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a memory device, manufactured by the master slice method, able to be formed with a two stage word line driver if it has a sufficient power source margin, so as to operate rapidly, and able to be formed with a one stage word line driver when necessary, to secure a sufficient power source margin. An embodiment of the present invention can provide for the formation of an ECL type memory device having an optimal number of word line driver stages having regard to the power source margin at which the device will be used . According to the present invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device comprising a high potential source a low potential source a word line driver portion which is connected between said high potential source and a word line and which receives a selection signal to make the selection level of the selected word line by a predetermined potential lower than said high potential source and a plurality of memory cells connected to said word lines, characterised in that said semiconductor memory device forms a first device wherein said low potential source is connected to a first low potential source, or a second device wherein said low potential source is connected to a lower second low potential source that a plurality of driver transistors is provided in said word line driver portion to enable construction of a plurality of stages that in said first device, one stage is provided, which stage consists of one driver transistor having its collector connected to the high potential source, its base connected to said selection signal and its emitter connected to said word line, that in said second device, two stages are provided, which stages each consists of one driver transistor, the first of said driver transistors having its collector connected to said high potential source, its base connected to said selection signal, and its emitter connected to the second low potential source, the second of said driver transistors having its collector connected to the high potential source, its base connected to the emitter of said first driver transistor and its emitter to the word line, and that the selection level of the word lines in said first device is made higher than the selection level of the word lines in said second device. The number of stages of the driver transistors when the first low potential source is connected to the low potential source is thus smaller than when the second potential source is connected. The selection level of the word lines when the first low potential source is connected is made higher than when the second low potential source is connected. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a schematic circuit diagram of an ECL memory device. In Figure 1, 1 is an X address decoder for selecting a word line WL, 2 a Y address decoder for selecting a bit line BL, 3 a word line discharge circuit for discharging word lines WL so as to accelerate a fall in potential, 4 a sense circuit which amplifies selected cell information, 5 a circuit which controls read R , write W , and chip select CS operations, 6 memory cells CELL arranged in a matrix, and WD a word line driver shown schematically. When a chip select signal Figures 2A and 2C are circuit diagrams of essential portions of an embodiment of the present invention, including a construction from the X address decoder 1 to the word line driver WD in Figure 1. Figures 2B and 2D are level diagrams of the circuits shown in Figures 2A and 2C, respectively. For selectively forming, for example, a two stage or one stage construction, the word line driver WD is provided with two EF transistors T₂ and T₃. When a 100K type memory device having a high shallow potential source V In other words, in the case of a 10K type, a two stage construction is formed using the two EF transistors T₂ and T₃, an emitter resistor R₂ of the transistor T₂, and a constant current source J₂ connected by wire so as to raise the driveability driving ability . In this regard, note, as shown in Figure 2A and Figure 2C, that there are provided two kinds of load resistors R₁,R₁ and resistors R In Figures 2A and 2C, the values of the resistors R₁ and R₂, which constitute high power element means, are selected to be lower than the values of the resistors R₁ and R₂ , respectively, which constitute low power element means. In the case of the 10K type shown in Figure 2C, the resistors R₁ and R₂ are connected. As a result, the current i flowing in the resistor R₁ is smaller than the current i flowing in the resistor R₁ in the circuit of Figure 2A. By the provision of the two kinds of resistors and by change of the connection of the resistors, it is therefore possible to reduce the power loss. The relationship between the levels of the high potential source V For the 100K type of device, as shown in Figure 2A, the transistor T₂, resistor R₂, and constant current source J₂ are not used. Connection is made so that the output of the decoder 1 is directly supplied to the base of the transistor T₃, that is, the word line driver is formed in a one stage construction. As shown in Figure 2B, the potential of the selection level of the word line WL thus becomes higher by a value V As explained above, in the 10K type of device, since the low potential source V On the other hand, in the 100K type, since the low potential source V In the manufacturing process, a master bulk having the two driver transistors T₂, T₃, two resistors R₁,R₁ , R₂,R₂ , another resistor R₂, and current source circuit J₂, is manufactured for the both 10K and 100K type. In a process of forming wire patterns on the master bulk for producing finished devices, 10K and 100K type devices are selectively produced by connecting or disconnecting the nodes N₁ to N₆ as shown in Figure 2A and Figure 2C. Figure 3 is a circuit diagram showing a difference between the 10K and 100K types. As shown, a diode D as level shift means may be used for compensating for temperature in the 100K type, but not in the 10K type. This is achieved by connecting or not connecting the diode D between the nodes N₇ and N₈. The circuit is that of a usual ECL gate. In the case of a 10K type, the temperature characteristic of the EF transistor T The reason why the L level stabilises is that the reference voltage V Therefore, in the 100K type, the diode D is connected with the polarity shown in Figure 3. The base potential of the transistor T At the L level, the output level D Regarding the determination of the potential of the 100K type, a 100K type having such a temperature characteristic usually is required to be able to operate at a power source voltage shallower than a 10K type. If for example the word line driver is formed in two stages, the potential of the selected word line excessively decreases by an amount of one stage of V Figure 5 is a diagram of power source margins. It shows example ranges of usable voltages oblique line portions for 10K and 100K types made by the conventional common master slice method, the common master slice method of the present invention, and the conventional exclusive master slice method exclusive meaning methods exclusively for the 10K type and for the 100K type . The range of usable voltage is determined by taking a suitable margin between the minimum voltage which is required to operate the circuit elements as an upper limit and the high voltage at which breakdown of elements can be caused as a lower limit. The power source range of the 10K and 100K types made by the conventional master slice method is set so as to cover 5.2V to 4.5V for the purpose of operation even at 4.5V. Here, only the temperature compensation circuit is changed between the 10K and 100K types. The word line driver is a one stage construction in both cases. Even in conventional cases, 10K types have word line drivers of two stage constructions. However, this is in the case of the exclusive 10K method and does not operate by a 4.5V power source. In the case of the exclusive 100K method, the word line driver is of the one stage construction and operates by a 4.5V power source. Contrary to this, the 100K type of memory device produced by the common master slice method of the present invention may be the same as that produced by the conventional common master slice method and further the 10K type has a word line driver formed in a two or more stage construction. Although a power source near 5.2V, for example, is required by the 10K type and the driver cannot operate by a 4.5V power source, for example, the driveability driving ability increases. In the present invention, a common master slice method is used to produce 10K and 100K type semiconductor memory devices, e.g. ECL memory devices. Therefore, the word line driver is made to be able to be formed with one or two or more stages and a temperature compensation diode D is made connectable as a semi finished element provided on master slice . When the word line driver is formed in a two or more stage construction, other portions of the device should be adjusted correspondingly. For example, it may be required to adjust the level by inserting level shift means into other requisite portions, e.g., by connecting a diode D between the nodes N₉ and N₁₀ as shown in Figure 1. Such diodes are previously prepared. In the wiring process, the diode D is selectively connected according to the device type in the same way of the word driver circuit and driver gate in Figure 2A,2C. As explained above, in a semiconductor memory device such as an ECL type, generally the driver transistor of the word line driver is placed on for the selected word line to place it at a selection level lower by a predetermined level than the high potential source V Therefore, in the present invention, in the case of a 10K type having a large difference between V As explained above, according to an embodiment of the present invention, a 100K ECL memory device having no temperature coefficient at the ECL levels of output and a 10K ECL memory device having a temperature coefficient can be manufactured by a common master slice. Further, the word line driver in the latter can be formed in a two or more stage construction, enabling high speed operation. In general, an embodiment of the present invention can provide two types of semiconductor memory device manufactured by a common master slice. The first type of device is operable with power source voltages of a first power source margin, and has a word line driver portion including a first number of stages of driver transistors. The second type of device is operable with power source voltages of a second power source margin, greater than the first power source margin, and has a word line driver portion including a second number of stages of driver transistors, higher than the first number of stages of driver transistors.
