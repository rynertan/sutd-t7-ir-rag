# Fluid flow control structure for tundish.

## Abstract
An elongated tundish 10 for the continuous strand casting of molten metal has a plurality of outlet openings 22, 23, 24, 25 arranged in a row extending in the longitudi nal direction of the tundish. There is an elongated dam 30 extending in said longitudinal direction between the row of outlet openings and the location of impact 28 , on the tun dish bottom, of a ladle nozzle stream of molten metal. The dam provides uniform residence times in the tundish for molten metal exiting the tundish at inner and outer outlet openings in the row of openings. Fluid flow control structure 39 is located between the dam and the tundish side wall adjacent the row of outlet openings to avoid a dead zone in that region.
