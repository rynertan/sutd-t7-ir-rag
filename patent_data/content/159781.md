# Sensing apparatus.

## Abstract
A sensing apparatus has a probe 3 displaceable with re spect to a support arm 2 and to a reference position. The probe has a flat disc 1 5 mounting three transducers 7 which are spaced apart from one another at regular intervals. Each transducer has an elastomeric dielectric and is capable of pro ducing an electrical output signal in response to displacement of the probe from the reference position. An electrical circuit compares output signals produced by the transducers and evaluates the direction and or extent of probe displacement. Such evaluation may be used in the manipulator control system of an article handling equipment.
