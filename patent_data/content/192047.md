# FIXED ABRASIVE POLYURETHANE GRINDING MEDIA

## Abstract
A fixed abrasive grinding media is disclosed which includes a high open cell content polyurethane foam binder in which is dispersed a high concentration, from 50 to 70 by weight, of abrasive particles. The binder system includes one or two hydrophilic polyols an low molecular weight, highly reactive isocyanate a surfactant that controls open cell formation water and dual catalysts. One catalyst promotes the isocyanate water reaction and the other promotes only the isocyanate polyol reaction.
