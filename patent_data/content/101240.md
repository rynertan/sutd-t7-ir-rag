# Electrode for electrolyte circulation type cell stack secondary battery.

## Abstract
An electrode 18 for an electrolyte circulation type cell stack secondary battery includes a pair of microchannels 34, 34a for respectively supplying an electrolyte to or from an electrode member 30 and removing it therefrom. Each of the microchannels is formed with a first hindrance portion 361, 361a having a plurality of wall shaped projections 41, 42, 41a, 42a and a second hindrance portion 362, 362a integrally with a stepped portion 43, 43a in the electrode thickness direction and numerous small cylindrical projec tions 44, 44a arranged on the stepped portions in a staggered manner with respect to the flow direction of the electrolyte, thereby making uniform. Flow of the electrolyte on the surface of the electrode member is thereby rendered uniform, suppressing the formation of dendrites, providing uniform current density and improving the cell energy efficiency.
