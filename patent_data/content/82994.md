## Description
FLAME RETARDANT THESIOPLASTIC MOLDING COMPOSITIONS OF HIGH ELECTROCONDUCTIVITY This invention is directed to carbon black filled thermoplastic compositions which can be quickly fabricated by simple, elevated temperature molding techniques into structurally sound rigid articles which are both flame retardant and electrically conductive. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conductive plastic compositions have been well received as desirable raw materials for fabrication of a variety of specialized accessories and components, including static electricity dissipation devices, electrical heating elements, equipment parts for high frequency protection and or electro magnetic interference EMI shielding, video discs, anti static packaging profiles, and a variety of other electrical components such as electrodes, terminals, connectors, and the like. Thermosetting or heat curable polymer systems have, to date, been the most prominent of such conductive plastic materials which have been developed. For certain electrical applications, the resistance of many thermosetting materials to high temperature service conditions is a major consideration. However, generally a more important factor resides in the inherent reactivity responsible for the thermosetting character of these materials which tends to increase the polymeric interactions with the finely subdivided conductive solids e.g., metallic powders, carbon blacks and the like that must be incorporated into polymeric base materials in order to provide the appropriate levels of conductivity. Most thermoplastic resins, on the other hand, are considerably less likely to react with additions of finely divided solid fillers. This usually results in an actual deterioration of many structurally significant physical properties when thermoplastic resins loaded with carbon blacks, powdered metals and the like to the amounts required for reaching practical levels of electroconductivity. Such deficiencies have severely limited applications for these conductive thermoplastic compositions, confining them, for the most part, to the fabrication of at least partly supported auxiliary elements and secondary components like seals, gaskets, inserts and electrodes. In spite of such difficulties, filled thermoplastic systems have, of course, continued to receive attention since rigid thermoplastic resins offer definite advantages over most thermosetting materials.These advantaqes include, for example, ease of handling, melt processing convenience and the simplicity of fabricating finished articles therefrom by well known high speed plastic forming techniques such as, for example, extrusion and injection molding. Indicative of approaches which have been taken in an e ffort to develop carbon black filled thermoplastic compositions with the necessary overall performance and utility are those disclosted in the nublicaiions summarized below. U.S. 4,241,120 to Data et al discloses a method of formulating carbon black filled thermoplastic resin compositions wherein the carbon black particles are modified by grafting polymers onto the carbon black particles prior to adding them to a PVC base molding composition, said compositions containing from 12 to 409 carbon black suitable for video discs having low shrinkage characteristics. U.S. 4,228,050 to Martin et al discloses a carbon black filled compression molding composition containing from 128 to 408 carbon black suitable for video discs having low shrinkage characteristics. U.S. 4,151,132 to Khanna describes a carbon black filled molding composition containing 12E to 205 conductive carbon black particles, about 10 vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, 10e vinyl chloride maleate ester copolymer, and about 15 to 17 o polymeric plasticizers and processing aids with about 3.58 of two or more metal stabilizers and 1.5 of three or more lubricants, the remainder being a copolymer of vinyl chloride containing about 6 to 8X propylene. Additional approaches to solving the problems 0 providing thermoplastic molding compositions have been, for example, the use of graphite carbon fibers the use of special plastic materials such as hydroxy terminated polyether HTE and the like as reviewed, for example, inModern Plastics, p. 62 June, 1979 . These various products and or directions, however, appear to be limited in their application since they do not allow for the high speed, molten state, mixing and molding operations for which thermoplastics are so well suited and the reason for which thermoplastics are usually selected in commercial practice. Also, it will be appreciated that many of these materials will raise the cost of the manufactured item prohibitively when compared to the commercial alternatives already in use. In view of the apparent state of this art, a considerable need continues to exist for a flame retardant, thermoplastic molding composition of high electroconductivlty. In particular, a clear need is sensed for such compositions which are not only derived from a thermoplastic resinous matrix, but which can also be economically and conveniently prepared and dependably fabricated by conventional high speed techniques into a wide variety of shaped articles having both good conductivity and sound physical integrity.One of the most challenging raw material requirements in this field is the need for conductive thermoplastic molding and extrusion compounds suitable for forming flame retardant structural members of sufficient size, mass and complexity to serve as electronic equipment housings, dampers and or shields for absorbing or blocking out electromagnetic field effects or other high frequency electrical emissions. Thus, for example, the computer and auto industries have set guidelines which indicate that materials having a shielding effectiveness SE of 20 to 30dB will meet 50 of their needs, while an SE of 30 to 40dB will meet 95 of their needs.Shielding effectiveness is an absolute ratio normally expressed in decibels dB and defined on a logarithmic scale through the following equations SE 20 log Ei Et or SE 10 log Pi Pt where E is the field strength in volts per unit length, P is the field strength in watts per unit area, i is the incident field and t is the transmitted field. Alternatively, SE can also be expressed on a linear scale as a percent attenuation PA . PA is simply Ei Et x 100 or Pi Pt x 100 . Thus, 99 attenuation corresponds to 20dB 99.9 to 30dB and 99.99 to 40dB.Finally, it should be pointed out that there is often a crude correlation between the shielding effectiveness and the volume resistivity, such that a volume resistivity of lower than 6 ohm cm usual lav ensures that the shielding effectiveness will be at least 30dB. It is also understood, however, that this level of shielding effectiveness is not needed for anti static applications and, therefore, lower levels of protection will suffice, for example, volume resistivity levels of less than I x 108 ohm cm. Accordingly, a primary goal of the present invention is the production of a family of flame retardant, thermoplastic molding and extrusion compounds of high electroconductivity which can be readily shaped even by fast thermoplastic processing techniques to form rigid articles having well balanced all around physical properties and adequate structural stability for many diversified electrically conducting specialty applications. A more specific objective of the invention is to formulate flame retardant, thermoplastic molding and extrusion compounds, the ingredients and composition of which are further restricted and optimized so that exceptional levels of electroconductivity as well as outstanding physical properties are obtained in the articles molded therefrom without the need for grafting of the carbon black particles to a polymer.Such optimized molding and extrusion compounds are particularly needed for certain specialized structural uses, such as EMI shielding members, electronic equipment housings, and the like, as well as anti static materials such as video discs and packaging profiles, and thus represent a preferred embodiment of the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Broadly stated, the present invention comprises a flame retardant, thermoplastic molding and or extrusion compositions of high electroconductivity comprising between 28 and about 45z1 by weight of finely divided conductive carbon black substantially uniformly dispersed within a cementitious matrix having a chlorine content of at least about 24 by weight and composed predominantly of substantially thermoplastic resins not substantially less than half of which by weight are vinyl chloride polymers which have a vinyl chloride content of at least about 80 by weight and K values between about 45 and 70, said cementitious matrix also containing from about 38 to about 15 by weight of a well balanced combination of lubricants which are solid at temperatures from about ambient to about 50 C, together with effective stabilizers. Said cementitious matrix may also contain various optional additives compatible with the polymeric vinyl chloride base thereof. These optional additives include minor ingredients of the type normally used in very low concentrations, e.g., of the order of only 1 or 2t, such as, for example, liquid plasticizers and lubricants, dyes or pigments and various stabilization synergists, as well as a few auxiliary materials which may be incorporated in larger proportions, substantially the total content of which could run as high as about 10 by weight in some cases.However, the most significant of the optional additives are various solid polymeric adjuvants blendable with rigid vinyl chloride resins to modify properties such as processability, toughness and or high temperature strength, etc., the total amount of which most typically would equal. between about 5 and about 35 by weight, but may occasionally be as high as about 50 by weight of the cementitious matrix provided that the total chlorine content of said matrix is not below about 24 by weight. The most advantageous of these various polymeric adjuvants are those generally classified as impact modifiers.Wide variations are possible in the chemical composition of said polymeric impact modifiers, but they generally exhibit a fundamentally hybrid character reflecting the Presence. therein of segments or blocks varying significantly in compatibility with rigid vinyl chloride resins. Thus, effective polymeric adjuvants for this purpose are typically sufficiently compatible with the vinyl chloride resins to flux readilv therewith under normal melt blending conditions, but not to the point of total single phase miscibility. In the present case, they are preferably either copolymer products such as those obtained by so called graft polymerization process in the presence of preformed rubber, or chlorinated linear polyethylenes containing between about 25 and about 50 by weight of chlorine. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The vinyl chloride resins which serve as the basic and principal component of the cementitious matrix of the molding compounds of the present invention may be homopolymers and or copolymers containing not more than 20 by weight of suitable comonomers and having K values between about 45 and about 70, preferably between about 50 and about 60. These values correspond approximately to the lower to intermediate molecular weight range of such rigid resins, i.e., those from about 25,000 to about 110,000 in weight average molecular weight and preferably from about 40,000 to about 85,000.The best known of the suitable comonomers are vinylidene chloride, olefinic hydrocarbons like ethylene, propylene, etc., vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, vinyl aromatics such as stryene, acrylic acids and their derivatives e.g., ethyl acrylate, acrylamide or acrylonitrile and vinyl heterocyclics like vinyl pyridine. The most preferred of said base resins are those with K values between about 50 and about 60 and which contain at least about 80 by weight of vinyl chloride. The finely divided conductive carbon black suitable for use in the present invention generally are extremely finely divided, i.e., typically have an average particle size within the range of from about 25 millimicrons to about 35 millimicrons. Such conductive carbon black also has a bulk density range of about 125 g l to about 300 g l and a nitrogen surface area of from 2 about 200 to 1,500 m g. Examples of suitable carbon blacks which are commercially available will be found in the examples following below. In addition to the use of the finely divided conductive carbon black and the base vinyl chloride resins of lower to intermediate K value and or molecular weight as particularly described hereinabove, it is also essential to include in the cementitious matrix of the present invention a well balanced and highly effective stabilizer lubricant system of additives in order to enable thorough incorporation of said finely divided conductive carbon black particles to be effected with ease and safety and to assure adequate processability and stability in the carbon black filled thermoplastic compositions thus produced.This stabilizer lubricant system comprises at least three different classes of additive such that each of the three different classes comprises at least 1 by weight of the cementitious matrix and further characterized in that the total weight of this system does not exceed 15 of the total cementitious matrix weight. Thus, it can be seen that the total weight percent of this stabilizer lubricant system is from 38 to 15 , based on the weight of the total cementitious matrix. The first of these classes of additive is waxy lubricants. The waxy lubricants suitable for use in the present invention are preferably dervied from paraffinic hydrocarbon fractions found in mineral deposits such as petroleum, peat and coal or from essentially aliphatic hydrocarbon polymers such as polyethylene and similar polyolefins, including such materials which have been partially oxidized, animal and plant products such as wool wax and castor wax, as well as various mixtures of any of the same. These lubricants are solid at temperatures up to at least 50 C under normal pressure. Examples of waxy lubricants suitable for use in the present invention are, for example, 165 F waxes, such as Boler 1014 BolerPetroleum XL 165 American Hoechst oxidized polyethylene, such as AC 629A Allied Chemical ester waxes, including complex blends such as CW 2 NLIndustries polyethylene waxes, such as AC 6A AlliedChemical and amide waxes, such as Advawax 280F ThiokolChemical . The second class of additive in said sytem are fatty acid salts soaps of magnesium, lithium and or alkaline earth metals like calcium, strontium and barium, which may be primarily composed of a given soap such as calcium stearate or of mixed salts of two or more metals at least one of which is from this group with a given fatty acid or with mixed fatty acids containing between about 12 and about 24 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable fatty acid salts soaps useful in the present invention are, for example, Calcium stearate 392A SyntheticProducts and Magnesium stearate Synthetic Products . The third class of additive in the above said stabilizer lubricant system is stabilizing compounds ofGroup IVA or VA metals. These stabilizing compounds are primarily those containing tin, lead or antimony and include their soaps, e.g., stearates or octoates and other organic salts, for example, phenolates or maleates. In fact, many different inorganic and or organic salts of lead, for example, are satisfactory, such as sulfates, silicates, phosphites and phthalates. Basic forms of such lead salts i.e., those with empirical formulae reflecting the presence of some PbO are generally preferred.Specific examples suitable for use in the present invention are, for example, tribasic lead sulphate and dibasic lead stearate. The tin and antimony compounds of primary interest in the present invention, on the other hand, are mostly organometallic types such as the well known dialkyl tin compounds including, for example, dibutyl or dioctyl tin mercaptides or maleates and the like, and various antimony mercaptides or mercapto derivatives such as antimony trilauryl mercaptide, antimony triisooctylthioglycolate or butyl antimony dilauryl mercaptide. Although not necessary for providing electroconductive, flame retardant therm wlastic molding compositions with adequate physio properties ODW general use, the potential roles 4 tire present invention of several optional supplemental components need to be explored and discussed more fully in order to assure a full understanding of certain more limited embodiments or refined modifications which might be especially advantageous for particular purposes. As already indicated, the most advantageous class of optional ingredients, and the most important from the point of being advantageous in relatively large amounts, are the polymeric modifiers.These include many different types of essentially thermoplastic resins, but are generally limited to those with reasonably good compatability and at least gross miscibility with rigid vinyl chloride resins. The most important of these optional polymeric modifiers are those capable of improving impact strength of the thermoplastic resin based molding compositions.For demanding structural applications, the inclusion of such impact modifiers in amounts of from about 5 to about 20 by weight of the total cementitious matrix is highly recommended. In fact, even higher amounts of certain well balanced impact modifiers can be used, for example, up to about 50 by weight or more of said matrix provided they do not significantly diminish other desirable properties of the finished product such as their processability and high temperature strength.The preferred impact modifiers herein are the hybrid elastomeric plastomeric copolymer products formed by graft type polymerization of one or more suitable monomers from families such as the vinyl aromatics, acrylate monomers and acrylonitriles with a preformed rubbery backbone or elastomeric trunk polymer, particularly the well known butadiene containing rubbers.Other nongrafted polymeric impact modifiers are also known, such as, for example, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers and chlorinated polyethylenes7 and these sometimes can be used in appropriate amounts herein, either alone or together or in combinations with graft copolymers. Other polymeric modifiers of interest are generally wholly rigid thermoplastic resins which are completely miscible with a vinyl chloride base resin, hereafter referred to as processing aids. These may be added to improve melt flow and or processability of the molding composition and or to improve high temperature properties, and include post chlorinated vinyl chloride resins as well as a wide variety of low to high molecular weight miscible copolymers. Examples of such copolymers are, for example, those of methacrylate with ethylacrylate and or of acrylonitrile with styrene and or alpha methyl styrene.When used, these wholly thermoplastic resins can be included at any reasonable level, for example, from about 1 to about 40 by weight of the cementitious matrix, provided the total amount of all polymeric adjuvants is kept below about 50tO by weight thereof and the total chlorine content of said cementitious matrix is not reduced below about 24 by weight. The remaining optional ingredients such as pigments, opacifiers, colorants, liquid lubricants or plasticizers, syngerists or supplemental stabilizers, inert fillers and the like need very little additional comments since they are used in very minor amounts for special effects and in accordance with generally well established practices in the art. On the other hand, the total amounts of inert solid fillers and or liquid components do need to be monitored and limited to levels which do not seriously impair either electroconductivity levels or the overall balance of desirable physical properties.Thus, to avoid problems of this nature, the total amount of liquid components should not exceed about 5 by weight of the total thermoplastic cementitious matrix and the combination of inert fillers and liquid components should not total more than about 10E by weight thereof. Licuid components are those components, as described above, which are liquid at ambient temperatures at normal pressures. The preparation of thermoplastic molding and extrusion compositions of the present invention can generally be accomplished by adaptively coordinated use of known types of mixing equipment to combine the various components thereof into a homogeneously blended mixture consisting of a fused, resin based cementitious matrix through which the finely divided conductive carbon black particles are well dispersed with minimal damage thereto.Once achieved, this homogeneously blended dispersion of said carbon black particles through a continuous, fused mass of said cementitious matrix can be readily converted to compact pellets or granules by the usual plastic compounding techniques such as extrusion pelletizing, chopping, dicing, etc. To prevent extensive pulverizing or breaking up of said carbon black particles during their incorporation and dispersion through said matrix, any dry blending operations for combining. them with the matrix component should entail relatively mild or low speed agitation systems. It is preferable, but not critical, to have their ultimate thorough incorporation and dispersion through the matrix effected by a melt shearing and masticating step during which the resinous components reach a fused state and which is normally near the end of the overall mixing sequence. The characteristic slow speed kneading action of such a step enables said carbon black particles to be dispersed thoroughly into a softened, viscous, plasticated matrix without extensive damage of their structural integrity. A variety of plasticating and melt shearing equipment is available for such use, including essentially batch type mixing equipment such as Banbury and roll mills as well as essentially continuous mixers such as kneaders and mixing extruders represented by both twin screw devices and certain two stage, single screw devices. Certain of the minor auxiliary components of the present compositions can be introduced at almost any step of the overall mixing sequence. For example, any substantially inert filler materials can easily be added either at the matrix premixing state or along with said carbon black particles during or before the melt plastification stage. By the same token, certain other minor additives might logically be introduced along with such fillers, such as wetting agents, dispersion aids and or other processing aids. Even fine colorants or pigments like TiO2, especially in a predispersed master batch of same in a suitable carrier e.g., a compatible resin , can sometimes be successfully incorporated at the late stages of the mixing sequence. However, in the interest of overall production efficiency and economy, it is generally desirable to premix at least most of the matrix components, including, especially, such major ingredients as the rigid vinyl chloride base resin and the essential plasticizers and lubricants to form a homogeneous powder blend of substantially the full cementitious matrix before subjecting same to the melt shearing and plasticating step. It is also understood that adding the carbon black during this premixing is both possible and, in many cases, desirable. Normally, liquid components and at least a major portion of the more significant polymeric modifiers are also generally included in such powder blend premixes. Also understood is that the use of a starve fed hopper in a continuous mixer system is both possible and, in some applications, desirable. A wide variety of blending devices known in the art are satisfactory for preparing powder blends from a combination of ingredients such as those comprising a typical cementitious matrix of the present molding compositions, for example, a combination of ingredients having differing melting or softening points, but most o which are solids at ordinary room temperatures. The most efficient of such blenders are the high intensity, rotating blade types, including such commercially available makes as the Henschel Mixer, the Papenmeier DryMixer and the Welex Mixers. Due to the high intensity centrifugal action and turbulence created by their rotating blades, these mixers can rapidly create a homogenous powder blend of various particulate ingredients placed therein.A considerable amount of the kinetic energy of such mixers is simultaneously transferred to the ingredient materials as heat through the impacting and shearing performed thereon as well as resultant collisions and inpingements within the particulate materials. Such frictional heating is usually beneficial up to a point, e.g., by softening or melting some of the waxes and other low melting solids and assisting in a distribution throughout and in the assimilation of the other ingredients. However, the temperatures generated therein should not be allowed to rise sufficiently to cause fusion of major resin components such as the rigid vinyl chloride base resin.Although temperatures of 1500C or more may be safely reached by the end of said powder blending and premixing step, with most combinations of interest herein, there is usually little or no incentive for employing temperatures quite so high. It is preferred that the powder blend premixing be stopped when temperatures are still below 1250C, for example, at levels in the general range of about 800C to 12000. Such matrix component premixes can also be made by less intensive or lower speed powder blending techniques and equipment provided that minimizing the cycle time is not a paramount concern. Such a method is, for example, the mixing of ingredients using a ribbon blender. Supplemental heat, if needed, can be introduced in such cases from an external source, for example, and or by preheating of the component ingredients, if desirable, or expediting the attainment of a sufficiently hemogeneous powder blend.

The entire dry blended mixture for each batch was then introduced into a segmented twin screw counter rotating compounding extruder to produce a conductive carbon black filled thermoplastic resin based cementitious matrix. Conditions in the extruder were adjusted to obtain a melt temperature of said cementitious matrix of approximately 284 F to 3200F 140or to 1600C . This resulting material was then pelletized, and the pelletized material was injection molded at a stock temperature of 392 F 200 C into 1 8 thick, 6 wide, 8ski long test specimens and tested for electrical and mechanical properties with the following results TABLE I AElectrical Flexural Flexural Izod Impact StrengthBatch Wt.
