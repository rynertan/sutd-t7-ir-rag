## Description
PREPARATION OF DEKYDROPEPTIDES This invention relates to a process for preparing azlactones which have an unsaturated side chain.These azlactones, some of which are novel, are derived from peptides and are useful as intermediates for the preparation of dehydropeptides, some of which are novel, containing at least two amino acid residues. BACKGROUND ART In recent years peptide hormones and regulators of bodily functions have been discovered, e.g., bradykinin, enkephalin, TRK and LH RH. In addition, other peptides having valuble properties have been discovered, e.g. aspartame. In an effort to improve the activity and properties of these peptides, particularly to reduce their propensity to cleavage by enzymes, extensive research has been conducted. One of the approaches taken has been to attempt to introduce a dehydro amino acidinto the peptide sequence without adversely affecting the biological properties and optical activity of the compounds. Since most amino acids and peptides are optically active and only one stereoisomer has the desired biological properties, a sought after means to produce dehydropeptides is one that does not racemize the compound. This has been difficult to accomplish since processes which result in dehydro amino acids and dehydropeptides usually are conducted under conditions which result in an undersirable degree of racemization. Previous methods of producing dehydropeptides have generally been deficient since the processes result in low yields, are difficult to carry out, are limited as to the compounds which can be produced, or result in racemized compounds. Riordan et al, J. Org. Chem. 42,236 240 1977 discloses the reaction of N phthaloylglycyl D, phenylalanine and O chloranil in acetic anhydride to produce an unsaturated azlactone which is converted to an unsaturated N phthaloyl amino acid ester by ethanolysis. Carter et al, Org. Reac. 3,198 1947 and other reviewers of the chemistry of azlactones and unsaturated azlactones discuss a process wherein an azlactone is prepared in acetic anhydride from an N acyl glycine and condensed with an alkyl or aryl aldehyde in basic medium to form the unsaturated azlactone which is then hydrolyzed to form anN blocked dehydro amino acid which cannot be directly converted into a dehydropeptide. Schmidt et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 16,327 1977 and Ber. 108,2547 1975 as well as Shin et al, Bull.Chem. Soc. Japan 43,3219 1970 and 44,1657 1971 disclose syntheses of dehydro amino acids which lead to dehydro amino acid esters which are difficult to convert to a dehydroprotein. Olsen et al, J. Org. Chem. 42,2253,2256 1977 and Rich et al, J. Org. Chem. 42,3815 1977 have produced dehydropeptides directly from peptides. Olsen et al require the presence of a leaving group in the percursor peptide which is eliminated on treatment with a base. The leaving group is derived from the sulphur atom of cysteine or the hydroxyl group of serine, threonine or phenylserine. Rich et al use a mercaptan to protect the double bond of an N blocked dehydro amino acid.After the peptide is formed the mercaptan group is removed by oxidation and pyrolysis. This approach is disadvantageous since it has a multiplicity of steps and double bond cis and trans isomers are frequently formed. Doherty et al, J. Biol. Chem. 147,617 1943 produce unsaturated azlactones by the so called Bergmann method which invloves spontaneous dehydration of beta hydroxy amino acid azlactones to introduce double bonds. Erlenmeyer, Ann. 275, 1893 and Plöchl, Ber. 17,1616 1884 form unsaturated azlactones by reacting carbonyl compounds with acylglycines in the presence of acetic anhydride. King, U.S. Pat. 2478661, Cook et al, U.S. Pat.2569801 and Weitnauer, U.S. Pat. 2782203, disclose the preparation of azlactones with an unsaturated side chain by reacting amino acid compounds with acid anhydrides alone or in combination with a base such as pyridine or collidine. Morin et al, C. A. j7,92072g 1973 prepare dehydropeptides by oxidizing unsaturated azlactones with heavy metal acetates. Link, S.G. PhD. dissertation 77 18065 University of Psichigan 1977 reported making dehydroenkephalin i. e. tyrosylglycyl glycyl dehydrophenylalanyl methionine amide using a dehydrodipeptide produced by the Bergmann method. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a facile synthesis of optically active dehydropeptides having desirable biological properties and stability to enzyme cleavage. The dehydropeptides produced according to the present invention are generally characterized as being more resistant to enzyme degradation than the corresponding saturated peptide, more fat soluble than the corresponding saturated peptide, and having biological activity where the corresponding saturated peptide has biological activity. The azlactones with the unsaturated side chain are prepared by dehydrogenating the side chain of an azlactone formed from an N blocked peptide, preferably dipeptide, by reacting the azlactone with a benzoquinone oxidizing agent under alkaline conditions to introduce unsaturation at the alpha carbon atom, then converting the unsaturated azlactone to a dehydropeptide. Thus the process of the present invention comprises reacting an azlactone represented by the formula EMI4.1 wherein R is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aryl, or nitrogen containing heterocyclic group, and R is an N blocked amino acid residue or peptide chain, and stereoisomers thereof under basic conditions, with a quinone oxidizing agent to produce an azlactone with an unsaturated side chain represented by the formula EMI5.1 wherein R and R have the same meanings as in Formula I and stereoisomers thereof. As used herein alkyl means straight or branched chain alkyl groups having from one to eight carbon atoms, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, and octyl aryl means phenyl or naphthyl and heterocyclic means a 5 membered ring containing at least one nitrogen atom and at least three carbon atoms or a 5 membered heterocyclic ring containing one nitrogen and 4 carbon atoms fused to a benzene ring the substituents on the alkyl group may be hydroxyl, methylthio, guanidino, or amino groups the substiuents on the aryl group may be hydroxyl, iodo or phenoxy groups, the substituent on the heterocyrlic group may be a hydroxyl group. Formulas I and II include all stereoisomers and racemic mixtures of the compounds. This oxidation reaction can be depicted as follows REACTION SCHEME IEMI6.1 I II The azlactones which are used as starting materials in the process of this invention can be prepared by cyclizing N blocked peptides, preferably dipeptides, using known cyclization methods e.g, the mixed anhydride, acid halide or the carbodiimide method. Preferred for use in this invention is the use of the carbodiimide method. When utilizing compounds represented by FormulaI to form compounds represented by Formula II, stereoisomers and racemic mixtures of the starting compounds give rise to the corresponding stereoisomers or racemic mixtures of the final product. The preferred N blocked dipeptides can be any pair of amino acids or can be two of the same amino acid. Longer chain peptides can be used also. The peptides are optically active and can be in the racemic or the D or L forms. The choice of peptide depends on the dehydropeptide to be made. In every case the amino acid of the carboxyl terminal of the preferred dipeptide is the one which is dehydro genated. by the process of this invention. The amino acids which can be at the N blocked terminal of the peptide are, for example, glycine, serine, alanine, valine, norleucine, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, cysteine, cystine, methionine, arginine, lysine, ornithine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxy glutamic acid, phenylalanine, phenylserine, tyrosine, 3,5 diiodotyrosine, thyroxine, trytophan, proline, hydroxyproline, or histidine. The group which blocks the terminal nitrogen on the peptide must be one that is stable to weak bases, e.g , bases having a pK in a range of about 6 to 8. These blocking groups are known to peptide chemists. Examples of such groups are benzoxycarbonyl, tertiary butoxy carbonyl, biphenyloxy carbonyl, or phthaloyl groups. The amino acids which can be at the carboxyl terminal of the peptide are phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan or histidine. The preferred oxidation agent to dehydrogenate the azlactone of Formula I according to this invention is 2, 3 dichloro 5, 6 dicyano para benzoquinone DDQ . It has been found that while other benzoquinones, e.g., ortho chloranil, para chloranil and biphenylquinones can also cause dehydrogenation of azlactones according to this invention, they do not provide as high a yield as DDQ under the same conditions. About 5 to 10 lower yields than obtained with the process of this invention are obtained when the above mentioned Riordan et al method of oxidizing with o chloranil in the presence of acetic anhydride is used. The method of this invention requires the use of a basic catalyst. The base must be a weak base which is not strong enough to remove the N blocking group, racemize the peptide, or otherwise interfere with the reaction. If the base is too strong the yields are adversely affected. Bases which are suitable for use in this invention are weakly basic tertiary amines with pK s of about 6 to 8, e.g., collidine, pyridine, and imidazole. Preferred for use in the process of this invention is collidine. The solvents suitable for use in the process of this invention are organic solvents, such as dimethoxyethane or ethyl acetate. 1,2 Dimethoxyethane DME is the preferred solvent. The relative amounts of reactants used in the process can vary widely. Generally about one mole of the azlactone per mole of oxidizing agent is used.However, this can vary from 0.5 to 1.5 mole of azlactones per mole of oxidizing agent. Also the relative amounts of the oxidizing agents and the base can vary from about 0.25 to 1.5 moles of base per mole of oxidizing agent The preferred mole ratios are 1 mole of azlactone to 1 mole of oxidizing agent to 0.25 to 1 mole of base. The oxidation reaction is normally completed within 24 hours at room temperature, e.g., about 25 to 30 degrees Celsius. Nile these time and temperature reaction parameters are not critical, yields are usually adversely affected if the reaction is allowed to continue beyond 48 hours. Higher or lower temperatures also adversely affect the yields. The following Table I illustrates the effect of the reaction conditions on the yields.

To illustrate that the reaction does not cause racemization the following reactions were carried out. The azlactone of carbobenzoxy L prolyl dehydrophenylalanine was refluxed in tetrahydrofuran solution for 6 to 8 hours in the presence of pyridine, a weak base. No racemization occurred. The same azlactone was also refluxed in tetrahydrofuran in the presence of the strong base, triethylamine. Racemization occurred and was complete within 24 hours. From this one may expect that the presence of the weak base in the process of this invention will not cause appreciable racemization of the optically active stereoisomers. Racemization can be detected by NMR by treating both stereoisomers and the racemic unsaturated azlactone with alpha phenethylamine in boiling ethyl acetate.The amides obtained from the optically active azlactones showed a sharpdoublet for the methyl group in theNMR spectrum while the racemic compound gave an amide which showed a nicely separated pair of doublets corresponding to the expected diastereoisomers in the same region. Novel compounds which can be made by the oxidation process of this invention are those represented by the following formula EMI11.1 wherein R2 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aryl or nitrogen containing hetero cyclic group and Rod is an N blocked amino acid residue or peptide chain and stereoisomers thereof. Formula III is a general formula and it includes the racemic, the D and the L stereoisomers of the compounds within its scope. Preferred compounds within Formula III are those wherein R2 is phenyl and R3 is N blocked prolyl,N blocked alanyl, N blocked tyrosyl, N blocked leucyl,N blocked tryptophanyl, N blocked aspartyl andN blocked glutamyl. These compounds are preferred since they can be made into dehydropeptides that can be inserted into longer peptides to form compounds with useful activity. The most preferred novel compounds within formula III are those where R2 is phenyl and R3 is an N blocked prolyl. The unsaturated azlactones of Formulas II andIII can be converted into N blocked dehydropeptides having at least two amino acid residues and the corresponding dehydropeptides. The N blocked dehydropeptides in some cases have valuable biological properties but in all cases they can be converted to dehydropeptides which either have valuable properties or can be inserted into a polypeptide to modify and improve its properties.The process of this invention thus provides a means to tailor make dehydropeptides. The unsaturated polypeptides or their N blocked analogs which can be derived from the unsaturated azlactones of Formulas II and III according to this invention can contain up to fifteen amino acids including the dehydro amino acid. The identity of the amino acids in the polypeptide can vary depending on the particular polypeptide produced. All the amino acids found in biologically active polypeptides are contemplated.The dehydro amino acid can be anywhere in the polypeptide chain except at theN terminal The polypeptides which can be made according to this invention are those represented by the following formula A B m D E n IV wherein A is an N terminal amino acid in which the N can be blocked B and E are independently one or more amino acids and D is a dehydro amino acid selected from the group consisting of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and histidine m and n each are a whole number from 0 to 13 inclusive and the sum of m and n is from O to 13 inclusive acid addition salts, lower alkyl esters and amides thereof and stereoisomers thereof.Some of the compounds within Formula IV are novel and some are known. Those which are novel are represented by the following formula An D E1 n V wherein m and n are each a whole number from 0 to 13 inclusive and the sum of n and m is from 0 to 13 inclusive A1 is selected from the group consisting of N blocked pyroglutamyl, pyroglutamyl, N blocked aspartyl, aspartyl, N blocked arginyl, 3 mercaptopropionyl, arginyl, N blocked prolyl, prolyl, 3 mercapto 2 methylpropionyl, N blocked leucyl, leucyl, N blocked sarcosyl and sarcosyl B1 is selected from the group consisting of leucyl, alanyl, glycyl, prolyl, valyl, arginyl, and combinations thereof D1 is a dehydro amino acid selected from the group consisting of phenylalanine, tyrosine tryptophan and histidine E is selected from the group consisting of phenylalanine, methionine, serine, proline, arginine, histidine, leucine, valine, isoleucine, threonine, alanine, and combinations thereof acid addition salts, lower alkyl esters and amides thereof and stereo isomers thereof. The following are typical novel compounds ofFormula IV which can be made according to this invention.

One purpose in introducing unsaturatin into a peptide chain is to increase the binding of the peptides to active sites and protect the peptide from enzymatic cleavage, e.g. hydrolysis, in the bloodstream, thus enhancing activity. One method of measuring the stability of peptides to enzymatic hydrolysis is to treat the peptides with chymotrypsin which is specific for phenyl bonds. We have found that N blocked prolyl dehydrophenylalanyl phenylalanine, which is produced by reacting the azlactone ofN blocked prolyl dehydrophenylalanine with the tetramethyl guanidinium salt of phenylalanine in boiling aqueous acetone, is stable to chymotrypsin. N b enzyloxycarbonyl prolyl dehydrophenylalanylhistidinyl leucine, the analog of the C terminal tetrapeptide sequence of angiotensin I, was found to inhibit angiotensin I converting enzyme. When the tetrapeptide was freed of the blocking group by hydrogen bromide in acetic acid it was found to be inactive as an enzyme inhibitor. When glycyl dehydrophenylalanine is introduced into bradykinin BDK at the 4 and 5 positions BDK is Arg1 Pro2 Pro3 Gly4 Phe5 Ser6 Pro7 Phe8 Arg9 the BDK analog shows surprising activity in the guinea pig ileum contraction assay, i.e., withBDK as the standard at 100 the dehydro BDK shows a 247.6 increase in contraction. In addition, in the guinea pig blood pressure test, with BDK as the standard at 100 , the dehydro BDK decreased blood pressure to the extent of 6250 when given intravenously and when given intra arterially the reduction was 277.7 Dehydro BDK can be prepared by solid phase protein synthesis using a mixed anhydride coupling reaction. In addition, the dehydrophenylalanine analog of the long acting commercial analog of methionine enkaphalin is active in the guinea pig ileum contraction assay. This analog can also be made by solid phase protein synthesis. The compound leu dehydrophe val phe.OMe which inhibits renin can be produced from the azlactone of N blocked leu yl dehydrophenyl alanine by reaction with valyl phenylalanine tetramethyl guanidinium salt to form the N blocked compound leucyl dehydrophenylalanyl valylphenylalanine which can be deblocked by treatment with HBr HOAc, then esterified. It is also possible to introduce dehydropeptides into peptide hormones such as LH RH a decapeptide as well as the phenylalanine analog of TRH a tripeptide . Dehydropolypeptides can be produced either by conventional peptides synthesis once the dehydrodipeptide is made available by the process of this invention or the unsaturated azlactones of this invention can be used as precursors of polypeptides using various routes. The unsaturated azlactones can be converted directly into a dehydrodipeptide by the reaction with 32 hydrogen bromide in acetic acid at room temperature for about 0.5 to 1.5 hours. The resulting hydrobromide salt of the dehydropeptide can be recovered by precipitation. In order to use the unsaturated azlactone for other reactions, the N blocked dehydrodipeptide can be made by hydrolyzing the azlactone with IN sodium hydroxide removing the amount of product desired for other uses, then reforming the unsaturated azlactone by cyclizing the N blocked dehydrodipeptide with dicyclohexyl carbodiimide. The N blocked dehydropeptide can be freed of the blocking group by treatment with hydrogen bromide in acetic acid. The N blocked unsaturated azlactone can be converted by any one of three reaction sequences into a dehydropolypeptide. The most direct sequence is to treat the azlactone with the tetramethyl guanidinium salt of the peptide sequence to be added then deblocking the product with hydrogen bromide in acetic acid.

See Stewart et al, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Freeman Press, San Francisco 1969 .

REACTION SCHEME V EMI20.1 wherein R has the same meaning as in Formulas I and II R4 is an amino acid or peptide chain and P is a solid polymer such as a polydimethyl acrylamide or polystyrene. The N blocking group of the intermediate is removed by treatment with a conventional deblocking reagent. The addition of N blocked amino acids is then made in the desired sequence by first adding anN blocked amino acid to the peptide then deblocking and adding amino acids in the sequence desired. The polymer is removed by conventional means, e.g., treatment with HF or trifluoroacetic acid. Dehydropeptides which can be made in this manner are, for example Arginyl prolyl pro lyl glycyl dehydrophenyl alanyl seryl prolyl phenylalanyl arginine Sarcosyl arginyl valyl dehydrotyrosyl isoleucyl histidyl prolyl alanine Sarcosyl arginyl valyl tyrosyl soleucyl dehydrohistidyl prolyl alanine Sarcosyl arginyl valyl dehydrotyrosyl isoleucyl dehydrohi stidyl prolyl alanine Aspartyl arginyl valyl tyro syl i soleucyl hi stidyl prolyl dehydrophenylalanyl hi stidyl leucine Aspartyl arginyl valyl tyrosyl isoleucyl histidyl prolyl phenylalanyl dehydrohistidyl leucine Aspartyl arginyl valyl tyrosyl isoleucyl hi stidyl prolyl dehydrophenylalanine.
