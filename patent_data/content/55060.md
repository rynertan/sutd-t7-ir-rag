# Multiple element thermal actuator.

## Abstract
The actuator comprises a stack of bimetallic discs 18 and 20 in a housing 12 and held under compression by a spring loaded follower 32. The discs are concave to the right when cold and to the left when hot but are of two kinds, namely discs 18 with a lower transition temperature T1 alternating with discs 20 with a higher transition temperature T2. At temperatures be tween T1 and T2 the stack is expanded as shown. Below T1 and above T2 the discs all nest within each other and the stack is retracted. In an alternative embodiment permanently con cave discs alternate with the bimetallic discs and the stack is then retracted below T1, fully expanded above T2 and interme diately expanded between T1 and T2.
