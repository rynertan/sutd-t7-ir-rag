## Description
The invention herein concerns aspects of a process for production of ascorbic acid. It specifically relates to production of proteins using recombinant techniques and to the use of such proteins in chemical conversions. More particularly, the invention relates to the production of a single recombinant organism capable of synthesizing 2 KLG. The 2 KLG produced is a useful intermediate in the production of ascorbic acid vitamin C . Ascorbic acid has become a major chemical product in the United States, and elsewhere in the world, due to its importance in health maintenance. While there may be some controversy over its efficacy in ameliorating the tendency of individuals to contract certain minor illnesses, such as, for example, the common cold, there is no doubt that it is essential for human beings to ingest required amounts of vitamin C. It has become a matter of concern in recent years that natural foods may not provide adequate amounts of vitamin C. Accordingly, there has developed a large demand for ascorbic acid, both as an additive to foods which are marketed to the consumer with supplemented levels of this vitamin, and as a direct vitamin supplement. Furthermore, ascorbic acid is an effective antioxidant and thus finds applications as a preservative both in nutritional and in other products. There are a number of processes available, some commercially viable, for the production of vitamin C. Several of these result in the preliminary production of 2 keto L gulonic acid 2 KLG which can then be rather simply converted to ascorbic acid through acid or base catalyzed cyclization. Accordingly, 2 KLG has become, in itself, a material of considerable economic and industrial importance. Means are presently available in the art to convert relatively plentiful ordinary metabolites, such as, for example, D glucose, into 2,5 diketogluconic acid 2,5 DKG by processes involving the metabolism of prokaryotic microorganisms. See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,790,444 February 5, 1974 3,998,697 December 21, 1976 and EPO Application Publication No. 0046284 published February 24, 1982. The availability of this 2,5 DKG intermediate offers a starting material which is converted to the desired 2 KLG only by the single step of a two electron reduction. The reduction can be effected chemically or catalyzed enzymatically. Various bacterial strains are known which are capable of effecting this reduction. Such strains are found in the genera It is helpful to understand the context into which the present invention finds utility, by representing the process in terms of the relevant chemical conversions. An outline of a typical overall process for manufacture of ascorbic acid is shown in Reaction Scheme 1. The process conveniently begins with a metabolite ordinarily used by a microorganism such as, for example, D glucose which is the illustration chosen for Reaction Scheme 1. Through enzymatic conversions, the D glucose undergoes a series of oxidative steps to give 2,5 diketo D gluconic acid. It has been shown that this series of steps can be carried out in a single organism. U.S. Patent 3,790,444, EPO Appl. A20046284 supra such organisms are, for example, of the genus Gluconobacter, Acetobacter or Erwinia . Alternate preparations of ascorbic acid have circumvented the 2,5 DKG intermediate by a combination of fermentative and chemical oxidations, and are clearly more cumbersome than the process shown. Typical of these is the Reichstein synthesis which utilizes diacetone 2 keto L gulonic acid as a precursor to 2 KLG. This intermediate is generated through a series of reductive and oxidative steps involving fermentation, hydrogenation, and, e.g., permanganate oxidation, and the required sequence is clearly more complex than that involved in the reactions shown. The conversion of 2,5 DKG into 2 KLG can also be carried out enzymatically U.S. Patent 3,922,194 3,959,076 supra and 4,245,049 Jan. 13, 1981 . Means are presently well known in the art to convert the resulting 2 KLG into ascorbic acid. This may be done either in the presence of dilute acid and heat according to the method of Yamazaki, or in a two step process utilizing preliminary esterification in methanol, followed by lactonization in base. Effective procedures are described in Crawford, T.C., et al., Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry, Because of the availability of the appropriate genetic machinery, it is possible, as well as desirable, to transform an organism which is capable of producing the 2,5 DKG with the gene encoding the reductase. Thus, the same organism can effect the entire process of converting, for example, glucose or other suitable metabolite into the stable, storable intermediate 2 KLG. The present invention effects dramatic improvements in the process for converting a commonly available metabolite such as glucose into 2 KLG, a stable storable precursor for ascorbic acid. The pathway of the process described by the present invention encompasses the step of converting 2,5 DKG into 2 KLG. The current processes for formation of the 2 KLG intermediate involve, at best, the deployment of at least two organisms or killed cultures thereof, do not permit regulation of the enzyme levels available, and are limited to batchwise processes. One aspect of the invention is a process for the construction of a recombinant expression vector for the production of 2,5 DKG reductase. Other facets of this aspect include the expression vector so produced, cells and cell cultures transformed with it, and the product of such cells and cell cultures capable of effecting the reduction of 2,5 DKG stereospecifically to 2 KLG. The invention also relates to a process for converting glucose or other ordinary microbial metabolite into 2 KLG by fermentation by a single recombinant organism, and thereafter to ascorbic acid. It also relates to the recombinant organism capable of carrying out this process. Such an organism is conveniently constructed by transforming a host cell capable of effecting the conversion of the initial metabolite to 2,5 DKG with an expression vector encoding and capable of expressing the sequence for the 2,5 DKG reductase. Alternatively, such a recombinant organism is constructed by transforming an organism already producing the 2,5 DKG reductase with vectors encoding the enzymes responsible for the oxidation of metabolite to 2,5 DKG. In either event, use of proper inducible promoters and control systems within the construction of the expression vectors permit the regulation of enzymatic levels to optimize the rate at which the desired conversion steps take place. Figure 1 shows an expression vector for the 2,5 DKG reductase gene. Figures 2 and 3 show the construction of an alternative expression vector for the 2,5 DKG reductase gene. Figure 4 shows a sequence including the 2,5 DKG reductase gene and control regions of the pTrp1 35 expression vector. Figure 5 shows a stained gel of a protein extract from As used herein, 2,5 DKG reductase refers to a protein which is capable of catalyzing the conversion of 2,5 DKG stereoselectively to 2 KLG. In the specific example herein, the particular form of this enzyme present in Corynebacterium was purified, cloned, and expressed. However, other bacterial species, such as, for example, those from the genera It is well understood in the art that many of the compounds discussed in the instant specification, such as proteins and the acidic derivatives of saccharides, may exist in variety of ionization states depending upon their surrounding media, if in solution, or on the solutions from which they are prepared if in solid form. The use of a term such as, for example, gluconic acid, to designate such molecules is intended to include all ionization states of the organic molecule referred to. Thus, for example, both D gluconic acid and D gluconate refer to the same organic moiety, and are not intended to specify particular ionization states. It is well known that D gluconic acid can exist in unionized form, or may be available as, for example, the sodium, potassium, or other salt. The ionized or unionized form in which the compound is pertinent to the disclosure will either be apparent from the context to one skilled in the art or will be irrelavent. Thus, the 2,5 DKG reductase protein itself may exist in a variety of ionization states depending on pH. All of these ionization states are encompassed by the term 2,5 DKG reductase . Similarly, cells and cell cultures are used interchangeably unless the context makes it clear that one or the other is referred to. Transformation of cells or of a cell culture amounts to the same activity it is clear, of course, that it is the organisms themselves which take up the transforming material although it is a culture of them that is created with the cloning vehicle or other transforming agent. The cells and Microorganisms of this invention are defined to include any bacterial, or prokaryotic, organism. Expression vector includes vectors which are capable of expressing DNA sequences contained therein where such sequences are operably linked to other sequences capable of effecting their expression. It is implied, although not explicitly stated, that expression vectors must be replicable in the host organisms either as episomes or as an integral part of a chromosomal DNA clearly a lack of replicability would render them effectively inoperable. In sum, expression vector is also given a functional definition. Generally, expression vectors of utility in recombinant techniques are often in the form of plasmids, which term refers to circular double stranded DNA molecules which, in their vector form, are not bound to the chromosome. Other effective vectors commonly used are phage and non circularized DNA. In the present specification, plasmid and vector are often used interchangeably however, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors which serve equivalent functions and which are, or subsequently become, known. Recombinant cells refers to cells which have been transformed with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. Host cells refers to such cells before they have been transformed. In general, recombinant cells produce protein products encoded by such recombinant vectors and which they would not ordinarily produce without them however, the definition also includes cells which have been transformed with vectors encoding proteins which are, coincidentally, encoded in the bacterial chromosome or otherwise endogenously expressed in the recipient cell. The definition includes any cell which is producing the product of a xenogeneic sequence by virtue of recombinant techniques. Ordinary metabolite refers to such carbon sources as are commonly utilized by bacteria for growth. Examples of such metabolites are glucose, galactose, lactose, fructose or other carbohydrates which are readily available foodstuffs for such organisms. Such metabolites are defined herein to include enzymatic derivatives of such foodstuffs which are convertable into 2,5 diketo D gluconic acid. Such derivatives include D gluconic acid, D mannonic acid, L gulonic acid, L idonic acid, 2 keto D gluconic acid, 5 keto D gluconic acid, and 5 keto D mannonic acid. A preferred genus from which an organism is selected for preparation of pure 2,5 DKG reductase is In a preferred mode of preparation, the cell culture is grown under suitable conditions dependent on the strain of bacterium chosen, to an 0D Final verification of purification is achieved by size separation using, for example, sephadex gels, polyacrylamide gels, or TSK sizing gels using HPLC. For the enzyme contained in In summary, the purification of the enzyme involves the steps of cell lysis, anion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography and verification by size separation. With the exception of cell lysis, the steps may be performed in any convenient order, and the transition between steps monitored by assaying the activity according to the procedure in Example 2. The conversion may be carried out with the purified enzyme either in solution, or, preferably, in immobilized form. As the desired reaction is a reduction, a source of reducing equivalents is required the enzyme is specific for NADPH, and thus at least a catalytic amount of the coenzyme must be present and the reduced form constantly regenerated during the process. Sources of electrons for the reduction of the coenzyme may be provided by any reduced substrate in contact with an enzyme for its oxidation, such as, glucose glucose dehydrogenase formate formate dehydrogenase or glutamate glutamate dehydrogenase. The considerations in choosing a suitable source of reducing equivalents include the cost of the substrate and the specificity of the oxidation catalyzing enzyme which must be compatible with the NADP requirement of the purified 2,5 DKG reductase. Other systems for regenerating NADPH cofactors are known in the art using, for example H₂ as the source of reducing equivalents and lipoamide dehydrogenase and hydrogenase or ferredoxin reductase and hydrogenase as catalysts, as described by Wong, C.H. et al. In a typical conversion, the starting solution will contain 2,5 DKG in the concentration range of about 1 200 g L preferably around 10 50 g L with the pH of the medium controlled at about 5 7.5, preferably around 6.4. The pH may be maintained using suitable buffers such as, for example, phosphate buffer. The temperature range is about 15 C to 37 C, preferably around 25 C. The concentration of reducing cofactor NADPH typically around 0.001 mM to 2 mM, preferably around 0.01 0.03 mM with sufficient source of reducing equivalents to maintain such concentrations during the reaction. If the enzyme is supplied in solution, its concentration is of the order of 10 mg L of substrate medium, although, of course, the preferred concentration used will be dependent upon the desired rate of conversion and the specific enzyme chosen. If immobilized enzymes are used, the above described substrate solution is passed over a solid support containing adsorbed or covalently bound 2,5 DKG reductase. Ideally, the solid support will also contain a suitable catalyst as described above for conversion of the source of reducing equivalents in amounts sufficient to maintain the concentration of NADPH in the solution. For example, the solution in a typical conversion will contain an approximately equimolar amount of glucose, formate, glutamate or dissolved hydrogen to the 2,5 DKG concentration and the solid support will contain sufficient reducing catalyst to recycle continuously the NADP formed by the desired conversion to 2 KLG. Both the availability of large amounts of purified 2,5 DKG reductase and its ability to be generated The gene encoding 2,5 DKG reductase is cloned in either plasmid or phage vehicles from a genomic library created by partially digesting high molecular weight DNA from The complete functional gene is ligated into a suitable expression vector containing a promoter and ribosome binding site operable in the host cell into which the coding sequence will be transformed. In the current state of the art, there are a number of promotion control systems and suitable prokaryotic hosts available which are appropriate to the present invention. Similar hosts can be used both for cloning and for expression since prokaryotes are, in general, preferred for cloning of DNA sequences, and the method of 2 KLG production is most conveniently associated with such microbial systems. E. In general, plasmid expression or cloning vectors containing replication and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site, as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, By suitable cleavage and ligation of DNA sequences included in the aforementioned vectors and promoters with gene sequences prepared as outlined above encoding 2,5 DKG reductase, and by deleting any unnecessary or inhibitory sequences, prokaryotic host cells are transformed so as to be caused to produce the enzyme. The enzyme may then either be purified as outlined above, the intact or broken cells used directly as catalysts, or, alternatively, the host may be chosen so that once transformed it is capable of effecting the entire conversion of glucose or other suitable metabolite to the desired 2 KLG product. The availability of recombinant techniques to effect expression of enzymes in foreign hosts permits the achievement of the aspect of the invention which envisions production of 2 KLG in a single host organism from a readily available metabolite. This method has considerable advantage over presently used methods in that a single viable organism fermentation is substituted for two fermentations, and there is at least a partial balance of the oxidizing and reducing equivalents required for this conversion. At present there is no naturally occurring organism which is known to be capable of catalysis of this entire sequence of steps. Organisms are, however, known which effect the conversion of glucose or other ordinary metabolic substrate, such as, for example, galactose or fructose into 2,5 DKG. Another group of organisms is known which effects the conversion of the 2,5 DKG into 2 KLG, the latter conversion, of course, being catalyzed by a single enzyme within that organism, but utilizing the power of that organism to supply reducing equivalents. One approach to producing a single organism conversion that is included in this invention comprises construction of an expression vector for 2,5 DKG reductase as outlined above, and transformation of this vector into cells which are capable of the initial conversion of ordinary metabolites into the 2,5 DKG substrate for this enzyme. As outlined in Example 3 below, this transformation results in a single organism 2 KLG factory. The details of the vector construction, transformation, and use of the resultant organism in the transformation are outlined in the herein specification. An alternative approach is to clone and express the genes encoding the enzymes known to effect the conversion of glucose or other ordinary metabolite to 2,5 DKG from the organisms known to contain them as enumerated above to construct expression vectors containing these cloned gene sequences, and using such vectors transform cells which normally produce the reductase. A third approach is to transform a neutral host with the entire sequence of enzymes comprising the ordinary metabolite to 2 KLG scheme. This last approach offers the advantage of choice of host organism almost at will, for whatever desirable growth characteristics and nutritional requirements it may have. Thus, the use as host cells of organisms which have the heritage of a reasonable history of experience in their culture and growth, such as Once the organism capable carrying out the conversion has been created, the process of the invention may be carried out in a variety of ways depending on the nature of the construction of the expression vectors for the recombinant enzymes and upon the growth characteristics of the host. Typically, the host organism will be grown under conditions which are favorable to production of large quantities of cells and under conditions which are unfavorable for the expression of any foreign genes encoding the enzymes involved in the desired conversion. When a large number of cells has accumulated, suitable inducers or derepressors are added to the medium to cause the promoters supplied with such gene sequences to become active permitting the transcription and translation of the coding sequences. Upon suitable expression of these genes, and hence the presence of the desired catalytic quantities of enzyme, the starting material, such as glucose, is added to the medium at a level of 1 500 g L and the culture maintained at 20 C to about 40 C, preferably around 25 37 C for several hours until conversion to 2 KLG is effected. The starting material concentration may be maintained at a constant level through continuous feed control, and the 2 KLG produced is recovered from the medium either batchwise or continuously by means known in the art. In the examples below, the following general procedures were used in connection with probe construction, screening, hybridization of probe to desired material and in vector construction. Synthetic DNA probes were prepared by the method of Crea, R. and Horn, T., Plasmids were isolated from the identified cultures using the cleared lysate method of Clewell, D.B. and Helinski, Fragments of the cloned plasmids were prepared for sequencing by treating about 20 µg of plasmids with 10 to 50 units of the appropriate restriction enzyme or sequence of restriction enzymes in approximately 600 µl solution containing the appropriate buffer for the restriction enzyme used or sequence of buffers each enzyme incubation was at 37 C for one hour. After incubation with each enzyme, protein was removed and nucleic acids recovered by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Alternatively, plasmids were fragmented by DNAase I digestion in the presence of MnCl₂ Anderson, S. 1981 . Nucleic Acids Res. After cleavage, the preparation was treated for one hour at 37 C with 10 units Klenow DNA polymerase or T4 DNA polymerase in 100µl of Klenow buffer 50mM KPi, pH 7.5, 7mM MgCl₂, 1mM BME , containing 50 nmol dNTP. Protein was removed and nucleic acids recovered as above, and the nucleic acids suspended in 40µl of loading buffer for loading onto 6 percent polyacrylamide gel, as described above, for sizing. Alternatively, fragments may be cloned directly into an M13 vector. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method Sanger, F. et al 1977 . Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA DNA fragments, including cleaved expression plasmids were ligated by mixing the desired components e.g. vector fragment cut from 0.25 µg plasmid is mixed with insert cut from 1 µg of plasmid in 2O µl reaction mixture , which components were suitably end tailored to provide correct matching, with T4 DNA ligase. Approximately 10 units ligase were required for µg quantities of vector and insert components. The resulting plasmid vectors were then cloned by transforming Because 2,5 DKG is not readily commercially available, it was prepared by isolation from The following examples serve to illustrate but not to limit the invention The crude cell extract 1260 ml was adsorbed batchwise onto diethylaminoethylcellulose Whatman DE 52, 250 ml wet settled volume , and stirred for 0.5 hrs at room temperature, followed by recovery of the DE 52 resin in a glass filter funnel. The DE 52 resin was packed into a 5x30 cm column and washed with Tris buffer until baseline was established A280 0.7, A260 A280 1.7, indicating that nucleic acids were slowly washing off the column . The column was then eluted with a 0 1M linear NaCl gradient 1200ml at a flow rate of 110ml hr., and fractions were collected and assayed for DKG reductase activity. Two distinct peaks of activity catalyzing DKG reduction were found a peak eluting at approximately 0.4M NaCl contained the desired 2,5 DKG reductase which converts 2,5 DKG into 2 KLG another eluting at approximately 0.25M NaCl which did not convert 2,5 DKG into 2 KLG. The 0.4M eluting peak from the DE 52 column was dialysed overnight vs. 20mM Tris pH 8.0 and applied to a 2.5x4.5 column of Amicon Matrex Gel Blue A This resin consists of agarose beads with a covalently linked dye Cibacron blue F3GA which has an affinity for enzymes utilizing NADH or NADPH as a cofactor. The column was washed with Tris buffer and eluted with 1.0mM NADP. Fractions were collected and assayed for DKG reductase activity, and the activity pool concentrated 16 fold by ultrafiltration Amicon stirred cell, YM 5 membrane . The concentrated material from the Blue A column was dialysed overnight vs. 20mM Tris pH 8.0 and applied to an Altex TSK column 0.5x60cm buffered with 200mM ammonium bicarbonate. The TSK column separates proteins according to molecular weight. The 2,5 DKG reductase activity eluted in a single peak that corresponded to a molecular weight of 45,000 daltons and showed 99 percent purity i.e., was homogeneous according to this criterion. The enzyme was electrophoresed in an acrylamide gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS . Under both non reducing and reducing conditions, a single protein band with a molecular weight of approximately 34,000 daltons was found. No protein was found in the 45,000 dalton range as was found with HPLC . Amino acid sequence data show that the purified enzyme contains a single N terminal sequence. µ undetermined Amino acid hydrolysis data gives the following composition The following assay conditions were used to determine kinetic parameters No alteration of activity was observed in the presence of Mg Maximal activity was observed at pH 6.4. The enzyme is active over a broad pH range of 5.0 7.6. In order to quantitate the conversion of 2,5 DKG into 2 KLG, a reaction was carried out containing 2,5 DKG, 1.33 mM NADPH, 0.3mg 2,5 DKG reductase in 1 ml of 0.1M Tris Cl pH 7.5. After 5 h at 25 C the reaction had stopped and was analyzed for NADPH oxidation and 2 KLG production. A change in the absorbance at 380nm corresponding to 0.40 mM NADPH oxidized was observed. HPLC analysis on an organic acids column showed a single peak corresponding to 0.42 mM 2 KLG. No 2 KDG 2 keto D gluconic acid or 5 KDG 5 keto D gluconic acid was observed. HPLC analyses were verified by analysis of the GCMS of per trimethylsilylated derivatives prepared by addition of trimethylsilylimidazole pyridine 50 50 to a lyophilized reaction mixture for 30 min at 90 C, on a 25 meter 5 percent crosslinked phenylmethylsilicone fused silica bonded capillary column. Thin layer chromatography is also consistent with the above results. The Tm of the Genomic DNA was isolated from The colonies were picked into microtiter dishes, incubated overnight, and stamped onto nitrocellulose filters BA85 placed on LB plates containing ampicillin or chloramphenicol. The remaining portions of the colonies in the microtiter dishes are preserved by adding 25µl of 42 percent DMSO and storing at 20 C. The transferred portions of the colonies were incubated for 8 to 9 hours at 37 C and amplified by transferring the filters to plates containing 12.5µg ml chloramphenicol or spectinomycin and incubating at 37 C overnight. The plasmid library in Cells from positive colonies were grown up and plasmid DNA was isolated by the method of Clewell and Helinski Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA The 2,5 DKG reductase gene, accompanied by either its own or a synthetic ribosome binding site, is inserted downstream of the A cloned 2.2 Kb To mit12 single stranded DNA a deletion primer sequence The mitl2 RF DNA was digested with Cells are prepared for transformation by the method of Lacy and Sparks, Transformation is effected by incubation of 1 µg plasmid in 0.2 ml of competent cells at 0 C for 2 hr followed by heating to 42 C for 1 min. 3 ml of LB broth is added and cells are allowed to recover for 4 hrs at 37 C, then cells are plated on selective medium as described by Lacy and Sparks supra . Successful transformants are grown on LB broth to a density of 0.D.550 1.0, then centrifuged and resuspended in minimal medium in the presence of 0.2 percent glucose. IAA or IPTG is then added to the medium, and after 0.5 1.0 hrs, the cells recovered by centrifugation and lysed by treatment with lysozyme and a detergent Tween 80 . The supernatant is assayed for the presence of 2,5 DKG reductase as outlined in Example 2D. Table I , and the proteins analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Fig. 5 . The protein band representing the recombinant 2,5 DKG reductase was identified immunologically using the Western blotting procedure Tobin, H. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Cells of ptrp1 35 transformed Cells of ptrpl 35 transformed To demonstrate the production of 2 KLG from readily available carbon sources, the following experiment was performed. The production of 2 KLG by The glucose and the tetracycline were sterilized separately and added prior to inoculation. An inoculum was prepared by adding 1.0 ml of a frozen stock culture to 50 ml of Luria broth containing 5 g l glucose and 5 mg l tetracycline. The 250 ml baffled flask containing the inoculum was incubated at 30 C for 12 hours with shaking. A 250 ml baffled flask bias filled with 50 ml of the production medium above and inoculated with 1 ml of the inoculum. The flask was incubated with shaking at 30 C. The pH of the medium at the time of inoculation was 5.1 due to the acidity of corn steep liquor. After 57 hours the pH had risen to 8.71 and 2 KLG was shown to be present at a concentration of 0.6 mg ml by HPLC. The presence of 2 KLG was confirmed by HPLC and GC Mass Spectrometry.
