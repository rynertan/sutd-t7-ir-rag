# DOCUMENT COUNTER

## Abstract
Document counter with discharge means comprising a support for a wad of documents 14 , an endless conveyor belt 17 which can be moved about a rotational axis, means for guiding the conveyor belt in the plane of the support to engage the lowermost document on the support, and collect ing means comprising a flap wheel system 23 which can be rotated about a rotational axis which is parallel to the rota tional axis of the conveyor belt, flaps 25 extending from the periphery of the flap wheel system, said flaps forming pock ets mutually spaced circumferentially, which open in a direc tion opposite to the rotational direction of the flap wheel sys tem, and a receptacle 27 located at the moving path of the flaps for receiving the documents from the pockets of the flap wheel system. The discharge means and the collecting means are positioned adjacent each other with a holder gap positioned substantially n the circumference of the flap wheel system, and the rotational speed of the flap wheel system of the collecting means is lower than the rotational speed of the conveyor belt of the discharge means.
