# Progressive scan television receiver with adaptive memory addressing.

## Abstract
A video input signal S2 is stored in a memory 24 and read twice during a line interval to provide a processed video output signal having a doubled line rate 2FH for display on a display device 18 having a doubled horizontal sweep rate 2FH thereby providing a progressively scanned image having reduced visibility of line structure. The last address written in memory is used to control the starting time of the second memory read operation. This reduces the tendency of visible artifacts to occur in cases where the video input signal is non standard in the sense that the ratio of the color subcarrier frequency with respect to the line rate is such that there may not be a fixed number of color subcarrier cycles per line.
