# Magnetoresistive sensor for vertically recorded data and method of sensing such data.

## Abstract
An MR sensor for vertically recorded data, comprises a pair of thin film magnetoresistive strips R1, R2 connected electrically in parallel between two terminals T1, T2 . The strips are spaced apart a distance which is small relative to the density of the stored data to be sensed. The strips are mutually biased in opposite directions to corresponding points in the linear region of their respective curves by current from a constant current source attached to one terminal T1 . Since the resistances of the strips are equal, the current divides equally between the strips. The sensor is positioned adjacent the magnetic surface contaning stored data. Vertical components of the magnetic field from the vertically recorded data influence the resist ance of the strips differentially. When the sensor encounters a vertical flux transition, the output voltage V varies to produce a unimodal type pulse.
