# Continuously variable ratio transmission control system.

## Abstract
In a transmission mechanism having an actuator mem ber 98 which is movable to adjust the speed ratio of the transmission, the rate of movement of the actuator member is controlled to provide a desired overall response function. When the speed ratio error is less than a reference value, the rate of movement of the actuator member is controlled as a function of speed ratio, such that the overall rate of change of ratio produces stable response. When the speed ratio error is at or greater than the reference value, the rate of movement of the actuator member is controlled as a function of speed ratio error, such that the overall rate of change of ratio produces fast response consistent with drivability.
