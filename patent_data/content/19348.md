# Tri state encoding circuit for electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
One of three possible states of a device such as a switch 10 are encoded, utilizing only a single input line 22 from that device 10 . The tri state encoding circuit includes, in the case of a single pole, double throw switch 10 , a first signal source 18 which feeds signals of like frequency and duty cycle, but 180 out of phase to the respective fixed contacts 14, 16 of the switch. A first gating element 20 is interposed between a source of biasing signal and the movable contact 12 of the switch. Second and third gating elements 24, 26 receive control signals from the same or another signal source, these control signals being of like frequency and duty cycle but 180 out of phase. These second control signals are also of the same frequency as the first control signals, but may have a different duty cycle. The second and third gating elements 24, 26 are responsive to these control signals for controlling application of the signal on the movable contact 12 to first and second associated outputs A, B .
