# Production of dihydroxy arylophenones.

## Abstract
Production of a dihydroxy arylophenone by reacting a dia ryl carbonate in the presence of a fluoroalkane sulphonic acid. The diaryl carbonate is preferably diphenyl carbonate, the pro duct so formed being 4,4 dihydroxy benzophenone. The sul phonic acid is preferably trifluoromethane sulphonic acid.
