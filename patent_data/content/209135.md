## Description
The present invention relates to an electronic part insertion apparatus for inserting a large number of the same kind of electronic parts having leads, such as ICs integrated circuits , into a printed circuit board to perform a heating test, etc., of the electronic parts. In a conventional electronic part having leads, such as an IC, the IC is formed to have a function guarantee maximum temperature of 60 C to 70 C in an ambient temperature, and is formed practically to have a certain safety factor margin with respect to that temperature. However, defective or nearly defective ICs having defects or an inferior reliability sometimes occur. Therefore, before actually packaging the ICs on a printed circuit board, the ICs are usually tested by a high temperature heating test so called burn in test to confirm their acceptability. The high temperature heating test is performed under adverse conditions after housing many ICs of the same kind in a constant tem perature oven thermostatic chamber . Namely, a number of ICs, for example, 100, are inserted into a testing printed circuit board directly or through sockets, a plurality, for example, ten, of printed circuit boards are stacked one upon another in a box like shelf, the shelf being stacked in the thermo static chamber, connecters of the printed circuit boards are engaged with connectors provided inside the thermo static chamber, a temperature in the thermostatic chamber is increased to a predetermined high value for example, 120 C , a voltage for example, 5V , which is equivalent to the voltage actually used, is applied to respective ICs to cause the ICs to generate heat, and this state is maintained for a predetermined period of time for example, 72 hours or 48 hours to complete the high temperature heating test. Through this high temperature heating test, ICs having certain defects will be broken or damaged and are then rejected. After the heating test, a function test is performed on the ICs by a tester to determine acceptable and not acceptable ICs, and the accepted ICs are then packaged on a printed circuit board. When carrying out the high temperature heating test according to the prior art on the same kind of electronic parts such as ICs having leads, in most cases a worker must wear a grounding band when manually inserting the ICs one by one into a printed circuit board directly, or through sockets mounted on the printed circuit board.

In this embodiment, the size of a gap pitch W₁ Fig. 2 between the hands 44 is set to be twice the size of a gap pitch W₂ between the rows of sockets 18 shown in Fig. 3. The pitch W₂ between the sockets 18 is set to 25.4 mm, and therefore, the pitch between the hands 44 is set to W₁ 2W₂ , i.e., W₁ 50.8 mm. Accordingly, when inserting the ICs 10 into the printed circuit board 15 shown in Fig. 3, the ICs 10 are cycli cally inserted into four 13 socket rows among eight socket rows by four hands 44 when the printed circuit board is moves in the one direction, and cyclically inserted into four 12 socket rows when the printed circuit board 15 moves in the opposite direction. Namely, by the movement of the printed circuit board 15 in two different directions 100 ICs 10 can be inserted into the printed circuit board 15. If, for example, one lot comprises ten printed circuit boards 15, i.e., 1000 ICs 10, according to the present embodiment the one lot of ICs can be inserted within a short time of 30 minutes, so that the IC insertion time will be greatly reduced. Also, according to the present embodiment, the number of hands 44 can be easily increased and decreased as and when required. As described above, the inclined portion 30 of the present invention realizes an automatic supply of electronic parts ICs 10 having leads from an upper part to a lower part of the inclined portion 30 by allowing the electronic parts to slide down under their weight. The electronic parts ICs 10 which are posi tioned by the positioning mechanism 36 at the lower portion of the inclined portion 30 are transferred from the inclined portion 30 onto the printed circuit board 15, which is located horizontally, and are easily and automatically inserted into the printed circuit board 15 by the hand portion 40. As a result, the present invention has a simple structure and can greatly reduce the time needed for insertion of the electronic parts, and can achieve an excellent effect in that static electricity is thereby prevented from flowing into the electronic parts through contact with human operators.

The guide plate 361 is supported by a supporting member not shown in such a manner that the guide plate 361 can reciprocate in a back and forth direction a longitudinal direction of each guide rail 31 , and driven by a cylinder 363. When the ICs 10 are fed and slid one by one from the intermittent feeding mechanism 35, a forefront of the guide plate 361 proceeds near to the positioning piece 362 as shown in Fig. 8 to prevent the IC 10 from jumping out of position and to settle the IC 10 when the IC 10 is stopped by the positioning piece 362. After that, the guide plate 361 is retracted rearward upstream of the guide rail 31 from the position shown in Fig. 8 to be spaced from the IC 10. The positioning piece 362 is arranged at the lower end of each guide rail 31 in such a manner that it can reciprocate in a back and forth direction a longi tudinal direction of the guide rail 31 , has a pair of left and right receiving nails 362a adjacent to both side faces of the guide rail 31, and is driven by a cylinder 364. The positioning piece 362 is usually kept at a predetermined position shown in Fig. 8 to receive and stop the left and right leads 11 of the IC 10 which is fed from the intermittent feeding mechanism 35 and sliding under its own weight, by the receiving nails 362a, and to position the IC 10, using the leads 11 as a reference, at a predetermined position on an inclined surface of the guide rail 31, i.e., at a position corresponding to a first pivoted position of a hand 44 Fig. 1 indicated by the reference mark P₁. After the IC 10 is pushed and positioned by the hand 44, the positioning piece 363 moves frontward. The positioned IC 10 is then held by the hand 44 Fig. 1 . As des cribed above, the leads of the IC 10 are received and stopped to position the IC 10 by using the leads 11 as a reference so that the positioning of the IC 10 will be performed accurately. Further, an advantage is provided in that the leads 11 act to give a kind of cushioning effect when the IC 10 abuts against the positioning piece 362. In Fig. 8, 39 represents an IC guide plate fixed on the upstream side of the intermittent feeding mechanism 35, and this IC guide plate 39 is slightly spaced from the top of the IC 10. The operation of the above embodiment will be described with reference to Fig. 9, in which specific ICs are represented by the reference marks 10 1, 10 2, and 10 3 to assist with an easy understanding. The reference marks 351a and 352a represent reciprocating piston rods of the cylinders 351 and 352 respectively. As shown in Fig. 9 A , the rods 351a and 352a project, and the rod 351a stops the ICs 10 1 to 10 3 which are sliding downward on the guide rail 31. In Fig. 9 B , the rod 351a retracts to allow the ICs 10 1 to 10 3 to pass, and then the rod 352a stops the ICs 10 1 to 10 3. In Fig. 9 C , the rod 351a projects to push and position the IC 10 2 on the guide rail 31. In Fig. 9 D , the rod 352a retracts to release the IC 10 1. Accordingly, the IC 10 1 slides downward on the guide rail 31 under its own weight, and is stopped and positioned by the positioning piece 362 as described before. The rod 352a then projects and the rod 351a retracts, to become in a state as shown in Fig. 9 B , and the operations shown in Figs. 9 C and 9 D then follow. The ICs 10 2 and 10 3 are then successively and intermittently fed and positioned by the positioning piece 362. In the above embodiment, the positioning operations do not necessarily start from the operation of Fig. 9 A , but may start from the operation of Fig. 9 B if required. As described above, according to the present invention, the electronic parts 10 having leads can be fed one by one by the intermittent feeding mechanism 35 arranged in the middle portion of the guide rail 31, which constitutes the inclined portion 30. Further, the electronic parts 10 can be stably and firmly positioned on the guide rail 31 by the positioning mechanism 36 provided at a lower end portion of the guide rail 31. As a result, the present invention has a simple structure and contributes to an accurate and smooth automatic insertion of the electronic parts 10 having leads. Still another embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 10 and 11. The feature of this embodiment exists in a holding mechanism for holding an IC 10 having leads electronic part having leads which has been positioned on an inclined surface at a lower end portion of the guide rail 31 namely, at a first pivoted position P₁ of the hand 44 shown in Fig. 1. The embodiment comprises basically an inclined guide rail 31 a positioning piece positioning member 362 disposed at a lower end portion of the guide rail 31 and a hand 44 provided with a pushing member 44 27 for pushing and positioning an IC 10 on an inclined surface, the IC 10 having been placed on the inclined surface an upper surface of the lower end portion of the guide rail 31, and clamping nails for clamping the pushed and positioned IC 10 through leads 11 thereof. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, in this embodiment, four guide rails 31 are arranged side by side corresponding to respective stick container cassettes 21 of a stick container portion 20. Each guide rail 31 is inclined by an inclination angle α in this embodiment, α 35 and fixed on a supporting frame 38. The positioning piece 362 is a component of an IC positioning mechanism 36 and arranged at an lower end portion of the guide rail 31 in such a manner that the positioning piece 362 can recipro cate in a back and forth direction along the guide rail 31 . The positioning piece 362 has a pair of left and right receiving nails 362a adjacent to both side faces of the guide rail 31, and is driven by a cylinder 364. The positioning piece is usually kept at a pre determined position as shown in Fig. 3 to receive leads 11 of a sliding IC 10 by the receiving nails 362a and to position the IC 10 at a predetermined position on an inclined surface of the guide rail 31, i.e., at a position corresponding to a first pivoted position of a hand 44 indicated by the reference mark P₁. The hand 44 is constituted as shown in Figs. 10A and B, in which Fig. 10A is a side view partly broken, and Fig. 10B a front view partly broken. An outer frame 44 1 which is a hand proper having a frame shape is fixed to the bottom of a hand supporting plate 43. As shown in Fig. 10A, an inner frame 44 2 of an upside down U shape is disposed inside the outer frame 44 1. A pair of front and rear side members 44 lb of the outer frame 44 1 and a pair of front and rear side members 44 2b of the inner frame 44 2 are connected in such a manner that they are slidable up and down relative to each other through ball rollers 44 3. As shown in Fig. 10B, an upper member 44 2a of the inner frame 44 2 is provided with a pair of left and right pins 44 4 which are arranged in parallel with a center line C₃ Fig. 10 A to pass slidably through the upper member 44 2a. Upper ends of the pins 44 4 pass through an upper member 44 1a of the outer frame 44 1 and abut against the bottom of the hand supporting plate 43 by which the pins 44 4 are stopped. A spring receiver 44 4a is provided at an upper portion of each of the pins 44 4, and a compression spring 44 5 is wound around each pin 44 4 between the spring receiver 44 4a and the top of the upper member 44 2a. There are provided two springs 44 5 in total which are compressed in advance with a predetermined load in this embodiment, a 4 kg pre load is given to the two springs 44 5 . Therefore, by the springs 44 5, lower end faces of the side members 44 2b of the inner frame 44 2 are always biased against the tops of the lower members 44 1c of the outer frame 44 1 with a pressure of 4 kg in total. Supporting shafts 44 6 and 44 7 are arranged to pass through the side members 44 2b of the inner frame 44 2 Fig. 10 B . Clamping arms 44 9 and 44 8 are rotatably supported by the supporting shafts 44 6 and 44 7. Lower portions of the clamping arms 44 8 and 44 9 are arranged to perform the opening and closing movement in a left and right direction, i.e., in a direction indicated by an arrow mark D shown in Fig. 10B. The clamping arm 44 8 is formed to have substantially an L shape side face as shown in Fig. 10A, and to have substantially an upside down L shape front face as shown in Fig. 10B. An end portion of an upper portion 44 8a of the clamping arm 44 8 is rotatably supported by the supporting shaft 44 7 as described above, and a clamping nail 44 10 is fixed to a lower portion 44 8b of the clamping arm 44 8. An upper portion 44 9a of the clamping arm 44 9 is formed in a left and right inverted shape with respect to that of the clamping arm 44 8 as shown in Fig. 10B, and a lower portion 44 9b of the clamping arm 44 9 is formed in a front and rear inverted shape with respect to that of the clamping arm 44 8 as shown in Fig. 10A. An end of the upper portion 44 9a is rotatably supported by the supporting shaft 44 6, and a clamping nail 44 11 is fixed to the lower portion 44 9b. In the center portions of the upper portions 44 8a and 44 9a of the clamping arms 44 8 and 44 9, operation holes 44 8c and 44 9c, respectively, are formed which align with and pass through the center portions. Operation rings 44 12 and 44 13 are arranged in the operation holes 44 8c and 44 9c, respectively. The operation rings 44 12 and 44 13 are rotatably supported by a supporting pin 44 14 Fig. 10 B . The supporting pin 44 14 projects from the front and rear faces of an operation plate 44 15 which is arranged to be movable up and down between the upper portions 44 8a and 44 9a of the clamping arms. the operation plate 44 15 is con nected and fixed to an end of a piston rod 44 31a of a cylinder 44 31 which is fixed on an upper surface of the upper member 44 2a of the inner frame 44 2 along the center line C₃ Fig. 10 B . Therefore, according to the up and down movement of the piston rod 44 31a, the lower portions 44 8b and 44 9b of the clamping arms 44 8 and 44 9 are caused to perform the opening closing movements in a left and right direction in a direction indicated by an arrow mark D shown in Fig. 10B around the supporting shafts 44 7 and 44 6, respectively, and through the operation plates 44 15, the operation rings 44 12 and 44 13, and the operation holes 44 8C and 44 9c, respectively. The clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 are caused to perform the opening closing movements together with the clamping arms 44 8 and 44 9. According to the movements, the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 clamp or release the IC 10. As shown in Fig. 10A, socket pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 each having a frame like shape are arranged inside the inner frame 44 2. The pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 are connected to the inner frame 44 2 through ball rollers 44 18 in such a manner that the pressing members can slide up and down. As shown in Fig. 10 B , the pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 are arranged as a pair. On upper surfaces of the pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 are fixed two supporting pins 44 19, respectively, i.e., four pieces in total, in parallel with the center line C₃. An upper end portion of each pin 44 19 passes slidably through the upper member 44 2a of the inner frame 44 2, and is suspendingly fitted to the upper member 44 2a by a receiver ring 44 20 which is located on top of the upper member 44 2a. Between the lower surface of the upper member 44 2a of the inner frame 44 2 and the upper surfaces of the pressing members 44 16 and 44 17, compression springs 44 21 are wound around pins 44 19, respectively. Therefore, four springs 44 21 in total are arranged to have pre load which is given to the four springs totally in advance in this embodiment, the pre load of about 1.5 kg is given in total for four springs . As a result, the socket pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 are suspendingly fitted to the inner frame 44 2 through the supporting pins 44 19, and in a free state, pressed constantly downward with a pressure of about 1.5 kg in total 0.75 kg per pressing member given by the compression springs 44 21. As shown in Fig. 10 A , a pair of front and rear pins 44 22 only a front pin is shown pass slidably through the lower member 44 1c of the outer frame 44 1 with the center line C₃ being the center of the front and rear pins 44 22. The pins 44 22 are fitted to the upper surface of the lower member 44 1c by receiver rings 44 23 which are disposed in the middle of the pins 44 22, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10 A , a spring receiver plate 44 24 having an upside down L shape in cross section is fixed on an inner surface of the lower member 44 1c. An upper end portion of each pin 44 22 passes slidably through the spring receiver plate 44 24. Between the spring receiver plate 44 24 and the receiver ring 44 23, a compression spring 44 25 is wound around each pin 44 22. There are arranged two springs 44 25 in total to which a predetermined pre load for two springs in this embodiment, about 2 kg of pre load for two springs is given. Therefore, in a free state, the pin 44 22 is pressed against an upper surface of the lower member 44 1c of the outer frame through the receiver ring 44 23 by the springs 44 25 with the pressure of about 2 kg in total i kg per pin . A pusher plate 44 26 for pushing the IC 10 is fixed at the lower end portions of the supporting pins 44 22. The pusher plate 44 26 is slightly spaced from a lower surface of the lower member 44 1c of the outer frame. As shown in Fig. 10A, a pressing member 44 27 for pressing the IC 10 is arranged about the center portion of the pusher plate 44 26. The pressing member 44 27 passes slidably through the pusher plate 44 26 in parallel with the center line C₃. The pressing member 44 27 has at its lower end a head portion 44 27a for pressing the IC 10, and is fitted to an upper surface of the pusher plate 44 26 by a receiver ring 44 28 which is fixed to the upper end of the pressing member 44 27. Between the lower surface of the pusher plate 44 26 and the head portion 44 27a of the pressing member 44 27, a compression spring 44 29 is wound around the pressing member 44 47. The spring 44 29 is arranged to have a predetermined pre load in this embodiment, about 0.05 kg of pre load . Therefore, in a free state, the pressing member 44 27 is always pressed downward by the spring 44 29 with a pressure of about 0.05 kg so that the head portion 44 27a projects from the lowermost surface of the pusher plate 44 26. In Fig. 10 A , the reference numeral 44 30 represents a microswitch fixed to a recess formed on the lower member 44 1c of the outer frame. The microswitch 44 30 is actuated by the pusher plate 44 26 when an abnormal state such as an erroneous insertion of the IC 10 generates an abnormal signal. The hand 44 is constituted as mentioned above so that, as will be described later, the pressing member 44 27 can press and position the IC 10 on the inclined surface, and a pair of the left and right clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 can clamp the IC 10 through the leads 11 of the IC 10. Figure 10B shows a state in which the IC 10 is clamped in such a manner. The operation of the above embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 11A, B, C, D, and E, in which Figs. 11C and 11E are front views viewed from the arrow marks E₁ and E₂ shown in Figs. 11B and 11D and showing an opening closing state of the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11. As shown in Fig. 11A, the positioning piece 362 stops and positions the IC 10 which is sliding downward on the guide rail 31 under its own weight. In this case, the leads 11 of the IC 10 are stopped by the receiver nails 362a of the positioning piece 362 and positioned with the leads 11 as a reference of the positioning. After that, the hand 44 descends obliquely, and the pressing member 44 27 the head portion 44 27a approaches the upper surface of the IC 10. As shown in Fig. 11B, the head portion 44 27a of the pressing member 44 27 abuts against the upper surface of IC 10, and the pressing member 44 27 is pushed into the pusher plate 44 26 by a predetermined length. Note, the lowermost surface of the pusher plate 44 26 does not abut against the IC 10. Accord ingly, a compression deflection action is caused in the compression spring 44 29, and due to the pressure of the spring 44 29, the pressing member 44 27 presses and positions the IC 10 on the inclined surface of the guide rail 31. At this time, the front ends lower ends of the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 are positioned in an open state on the sides of the left and right leads of the IC 10 as shown in Fig. 11 C . In a free state, the left and right leads 11 of the IC 10 are opened outwardly from vertical lines by about 10 C. As shown in Fig. 11D, the positioning piece 362 moves retracts toward the front of the guide rail 31 after the IC 10 is pressed and positioned by the pressing member 44 27. As shown in Fig. 11E, the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 are closed, and the front edges lower ends of the clamping nails press inward on the left and right leads 11 to place the leads 11 in parallel with each other, thereby clamping the IC 10. It is preferable that the leads 11 be pressed and clamped at their lower portions. Thus, the clamping operation of the IC 10 is completed. As described above, according to the present invention, the electronic part 10 having leads is positioned on the guide rail 31 through the leads 11 by the positioning piece positioning member 362 provided at the lower end portion of the inclined guide rail 31 which constitutes the inclined portion, pressed and positioned on the inclined surface by the pressing member 44 27 of the hand 44, and pressed to be clamped from the sides of leads 11 by a pair of the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 after the positioning piece 362 is retracted. In this way, the electronic part 10 can be clamped with an apparatus having a simple structure so that a correct and smooth automatic insertion of the electronic part 10 having leads can be realized. Further embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 10 and 12. The feature of this embodiment exists in an insertion mechanism for inserting an IC 10 having leads electronic part having leads into a printed circuit board at a second pivoted position P₂ of the hand 44 shown in Fig. 1. The present embodiment comprises basically a pair of left and right socket pressing members insertion surface pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 which are movable up and down by springs a pair of left and right clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 which clamp the IC 10 through its leads 11 and is movable near to an insertion surface and a pusher plate pusher member 44 26 for pushing and inserting the IC held by the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 into the insertion surface. The size of a gap g₁ shown in Fig. 10 A between the lower surface of the upper member 44 2a of the inner frame and the uppermost surface of the pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 in a free state , and the size of a gap g₂ shown in Fig. 10 B between the lowermost surfaces of the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 in a clamping state of the IC 10 and the lowermost surface of the pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 in a free state are set to be substantially the same. In this embodiment, the sizes of g₁ and g₂ are set to about 3.5 mm respectively. The hand 44 is constituted as mentioned above, and as will be described later, the pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 press the insertion surface in this embodi ment, an upper surface of a socket 18 on a printed circuit board 15 for the IC 10 in advance to align the insertion surface with a reference surface in this embodiment, a horizontal surface the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 holding the IC 10 approaching the insertion surface to guide the leads of the IC 10 toward the top of insertion surface, and the pusher plate 44 26 pushing the IC into the insertion surface. The pressing member 44 17 44 16 and the clamping nail 44 11 44 10 indicated by alternate long and two short dashes lines shown in Fig. 10B only the right side is shown are in a state such that the clamping nail 44 11 has approached the socket 18 after the pressing member 44 17 has pressed the socket 18. The operation of the present embodiment will be described with reference to Fig. 12. As shown in Fig. 12A, the whole of the hand 44 descends, and lower end surfaces lowermost surfaces of the socket pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 about against an upper surface insertion surface of the socket 18. The descending movement of the hand 44 is carried out by the cylinder 45 shown in Fig. 1, as described before. The hand 44 then descends further, and the pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 are pushed inside the outer frame 44 1 Figs. 10 so that springs 44 21 four in total as shown in Figs. 10. are com pressed and deflected. Due to the spring force of the springs 44 21, the pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 press the upper surface of the socket 18 to align the upper surface insertion surface with a reference surface if the upper surface of the socket 18 is inclined with respect to the reference surface in this embodi ment, a horizontal surface due to warpage of the printed circuit board 15. At this time, the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 descend relative to the pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 to approach the socket 18. As shown in Fig. 12B, the hand 44 descends further, and the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 descend until the lower end faces of the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 nearly abut against the upper surface of the socket 18 to align the leads 11 of the IC 10 with insertion holes 18a Fig. 12A of the socket 18. As shown in Fig. 12C, the hand 44 descends further, and the IC pressing member 44 27 is pushed inside the pusher member 44 26 against the compression spring 44 29 wound around the IC pressing member 44 27. The lowermost end face of the pusher member 44 26 abuts against the upper surface of the IC 10 to push it succesively so that the leads 11 of the IC 10 are pushed into the insertion holes Fig. 12 A of the socket 18. At this time, the compression spring 44 25 will not be deflected because the insertion pressure of the IC 10 is set to about 1 kg. The leads 11 are inserted by sliding the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11, and the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 clamp the leads 11. Thus, the inserting operation of the IC 10 is completed. Although the above embodiment shows that the IC 10 is inserted into the socket 18 which is mounted on the printed circuit board 15, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment but obviously is applicable also to a case in which the IC 10 is directly inserted into the printed circuit board 15. As described above, according to the present invention, the pressing members 44 16 and 44 17 abut in advance against the insertion surface to align the insertion surface with the reference surface, the clamping nails 44 10 and 44 11 hold the leads 11 of the electronic part 10 approaching the insertion surface to align the leads 11 with the insertion holes of the insertion surface, and then the pusher member 44 26 push the electronic part 10 to insert the electronic part 10 into the insertion surface. As a result, a correct and smooth automatic insertion of the electronic part 10 having leads is realized by a simple structure.
