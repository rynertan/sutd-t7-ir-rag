# Optical playback apparatus, focusing elements, and focusing system for producing a prescribed energy distribution along an axial focal zone.

## Abstract
An optical playback apparatus for reading data from a record 10 includes a focusing system 12, 22, 34, 46 for focusing a scanning light beam 20 onto data on the record without need for precision positioning of the record and optical elements 34, 46, 48 . The data modulates the beam for transmission to a light detector 14 to produce a playback data signal 58 corresponding to the recorded data. Beam 20 has an axially symmetric intensity distribution and lens 34 designed to focus such light along an axial focal zone 52, 54 with a specified intensity distribution. A uniform distribution provides the detector with a modulated light beam 36 of uniform average intensity regardless of the record s position along to focal zone. An entire family of nonconical, aspheical axicon type focusing elements for focusing energy from given source to a prescribed focal zone intensity distribution and a method of design are disclosed.
