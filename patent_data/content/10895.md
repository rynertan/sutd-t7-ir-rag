# Method of making laminates of thermoplastic polymers by a single channel coextrusion process and melt injector block for use therein.

## Abstract
The melt injector block contains guides for defining the width of secondary streams. This gives edge trim of base polymer only. Recycle is easier and stenter clips do not get stuck in heat seal layers.
