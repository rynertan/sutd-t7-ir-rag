# Torque limiter.

## Abstract
A device for limiting torque transmitted between an input shaft 70 and an output shaft 78 comprises a spring loaded clutch 71, 72, 75 between the shafts 70, 78 and a brake 81, 82 operable by relative rotation between input 71 and output 72 elements of the clutch. The brake 81, 82 is initially applied by a torque overload, and an increase in the overload results in increased braking force and displacement of an abutment 77 against a further spring 83 this displacement operating a latched indicator 90, 91 . The indicator is not therefore responsive to low level transient torque overlaods.
