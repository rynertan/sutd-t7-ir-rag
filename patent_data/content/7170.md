# Method of inhibiting corrosion of aluminium tubes by toothpastes.

## Abstract
The tendency of gel toothpastes comprising silica thick eners, such as silica aerogel or precipitated silica, and a fluoride source, such as sodium monofluorophosphate or fluoride, to corrode aluminium tubes can be reduced by incorporating at least 0.01 by weight sodium or potassium hydroxide or carbonate, so that the pH of the toothpaste is at least 8.5.
