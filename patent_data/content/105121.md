# Method for detecting a fault in a data recording system read channel.

## Abstract
A method for diagnosing card failure in a data processing magnetic tape READ channel. An input signal of a nominal am plitude is applied to the READ channel and the response time of the various components of the READ channel is deter mined, as well as the amplitude response of the READ chan nel. Card failure can be so identified to alert a user that repair action is needed, cut down diagnostic cost and error, by the field engineer to avoid data processing errors produced by a defective machine.
