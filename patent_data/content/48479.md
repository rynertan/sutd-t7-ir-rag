# Package dispenser mechanism.

## Abstract
A computer controlled system is disclosed for dispens ing selected packages from a vending machine. The system includes an ejector mechanism 10 adapted to travel rectilinearly intermediate a pair of oppositely mounted stor age banks 12, 14 , each bank consisting of a plurality of vertically oriented adjacent compartments 12a, 14a in which distinct packages are stacked. The ejector mechanism 10 includes a carriage 20 mounted on a helical screw 22 rotatably driven by a travel motor 30 . An ejector lever 34 pivotally connected to the carriage 20 is mounted upon an actuator bar 26 rotatably driven by a pivot member 32 for independently actuating one of a pair of overlapping ejector arms 36a, 36b according to the directional rotation of the pivot motor 32 . Each ejection arm 36a, 36b is pivotally connected to the carriage 20 and configured to discharge a single package from beneath a stack when actuated. A microprocessor 33 controls the rotational drive of the motors and is provided feedback signals indicative of carriage location and package availability by sensors 42, 45 attached to the carriage 20 .
