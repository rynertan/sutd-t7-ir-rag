# Tractor power lift mechanism.

## Abstract
The control mechanism of a tractor hydraulic power lift has a known manually adjustable flow control valve 18, 27, 28, 31, 30, 33, 32 for regulating the rate of lowering an implement. However, when the valve is so adjusted that a heavy ground working implement is lowered to ground level at a rate slow enough not to cause damage, the implement is then very slow to penetrate the ground to the desired working depth. A manually operable overriding mechanism 15, 14, 35, 36, 34 preferably actuated by the main hand lever 16 of the power lift mechanism is therefore provided to enable the valve to be moved temporarily into its fully open position and allowed to return to its adjusted position. The overriding mechanism is operated as the implement reaches ground level and released when it reaches its working depth.
