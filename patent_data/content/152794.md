# MULTI LAYERED ELECTRICAL INTERCONNECTION STRUCTURE

## Abstract
An interconnection package or a plurality of semicon ductor chips and a method for fabricating same. The method includes the fabrication of a multi layered glass ceramic base 32 , and the repeated steps of depositing a conductor pattern 48 on the base and forming thereon a crystallizable glass di electric layer 50 which is then crystallized to a glass ceramic prior to further additions of conductor patterns and crystalliz able glass layers to form a monolithic compatible substrate 30 all through. The composition of the crystallizable glass di electric layers is a borosilicate glass containing 50 to 70 cor dierite.
