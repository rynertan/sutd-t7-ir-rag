# APPARATUS WITH FLUID PRESSURE RELIEF MEANS

## Abstract
Fluid pressure apparatus having means for the relief of excess pressure comprising a resilient sealing member 44 or 302 or 322 or 342 urged against the periphery L of an open ing to seal against said opening and the sealing member displaceable or deformable to relieve excess pressure acting at said opening. In one example, a sealing disc 44 is held against the opening periphery by a spring 34 which allows the pressure force of the disc to move it away from the open ing. In another example, a sealing arrangement 302, 314 or 322, 326 or 342, 344 comprises portions of greater flexural compliance that deform to vent the excess pressure.
