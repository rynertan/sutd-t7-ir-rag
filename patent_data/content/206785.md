## Description
The invention relates generally to memory arrays and in particular to biasing a region in a semiconductor integrated circuit to a se lected voltage level and, more particularly, to a system for preventing undesired charge injection for bipolar latchup in a integrated circuit. Recent advances in CMOS technology have allowed memory circuit designers to realize the power reduction inherent in CMOS design while achieving high density. However, as memory cell size decreases to allow for high density arrays, the susceptibility of alpha parti cle induced soft errors in the array increases. A CMOS DRAM utilizing PMOS memory cells disposed in an N well formed in P substrate significantly reduces this soft error susceptibility. The N well must be biased to a higher voltage level than the PMOS transfer gates in the memory cells and the P channel bit line connections to reverse bias the semiconductor junctions formed between these PMOS elements and the N well. If these junctions are for ward biased, then undesired charge injection takes place between the PMOS memory cells and the bit line connec tions in the N well, thereby destroying the information stored in the memory. Additionally, the various P type and N type regions in a CMOS array form bipolar transis tors. If the above described junctions are forward biased then the transistors may form a feedback current loop to allow high substrate current. This phenomenon is termed bipolar latchup. The active cycle of the memory is initiated by clocking a control signal received at a control input of the memory. During the active cycle, selected word lines are clocked to couple selected storage cells to the bit lines. The voltage level on half the bit lines in the array are pulled to the power supply level, V The N well may be biased to a multiple of V However, during initial power up, or during an excursion in the value of the power supply voltage V Accordingly, a system for preventing the for ward biasing of the junctions between the bit lines and the N well during the active cycle of the memory is greatly needed in the industry. This system must pro tect the memory during initial power up and during a V The present invention is a system for prevent ing forward biasing of the bit line junctions and memory cell junctions formed between the N well and bit line terminals and memory cells, respectively. The system is for use with a memory array where the bit lines are precharged to a fraction of V The invention includes a gating system for forcing the array into precharge during a critical time period when V According to a further aspect of the invention, a well regulator and charge pump maintain V If the array were driven into the active cycle during this critical time period, then half the bit lines would be pulled to V The gating system prevents forward biasing during the critical period by holding the array in pre charge to maintain the bit line voltage at V In a preferred embodiment, the gate control signal is clocked by a CMOS differential amplifier hav ing its inverting input coupled to V According to a further aspect of the inven tion, a well enabling circuit clocks a well enabling signal to disable the differential amplifier when V According to a further aspect of the invention, a holding transistor holds the gate control signal at V The differential amplifier consumes power when in operation. By disabling the differential ampli fier subsequent to termination of the critical time period, power dissipation of the system is reduced.
