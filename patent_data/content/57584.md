# Optical scanning apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical scanning system which utilizes a skewed lens array 12 to image scan line segments onto an area array 24 of detector units. Each line segment is imaged onto a multiple time integration segment which enhances effective exposure by integration of muliple scans for each line segment.
