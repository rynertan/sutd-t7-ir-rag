# An electroerosive machining method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An EDM method and system in which a DC output is pulsed to produce a succession of discrete, time spaced, essentially unidirectional current pulses of a short duration not in excess of 10 microseconds for finish machining a workpiece 1 with a tool electrode 2 across a fluid flooded EDM gap each of the discrete current pulses having an essentially half cycle sinusoidally rising and falling current time characteristic and a peak current in excess of a predetermined current level. A clamping circuit 17 to 21 clips a peak current portion of each of the current pulses beyond the predetermined level to produce a reformed gap current pulse which is substantially square or trapezoid edged and has the predetermined current level.
