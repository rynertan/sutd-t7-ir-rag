# Gate turn off thyristor.

## Abstract
In a gate turn off thyristor including two separate gate electrodes, a first turning off gate signal is applied to the first gate electrode 91 and then a second turning off gate signal is applied to the second gate electrode 92 after a predeter mined time has elapsed in order to increase the maximum controllable anode current and decrease the sensitivity to anode voltage rising rate. This is achieved because the flow distribution of the anode current is rendered asymmetrical with respect to the structural center of the GTO and therefore the internal resistance between the cathode K and the second gate Gâ‚‚ is reduced, so that it is possible to increase the magnitude of turning off gate current near the time when the anode current drops sharply or at the end of GTO switching off operation.
