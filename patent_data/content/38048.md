# LIGHT SCANNING ASSEMBLY FOR ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTING PLATE MAKING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A light scanning assembly for electrophotographic printing plate making apparatus of the type which com prises an enclosure which houses a copyboard, an opti cal train and a carriage. The carriage moves in a horizon tal path beneath a platen carrying a sheet of electro photographic material. The carriage has a corona device, a slit, a toning device, including an electrical develop ment electrode or bias plate and means for withdrawing excess toner from the electrophotographic sheet after toning. The copyboard is loaded in horizontal position and moved along a guide track to a vertical position. When the copyboard is vertically oriented, the light scanning assembly is translated across the face of the copyboard in synchronism with the movement of the carriage to project the pattern on the copyboard hori zontally through an optical train from hence it is deviated upward to cooperate with the slit. The light scanning assembly comprises a support bracket mounting a pair of illuminating lamps disposed spaced one above the other respectively each with an associated elliptically configured reflector, whereby the light from each lamp is directed to a common band location across the face of the copyboard. The support bracket is driven, for translation of the lamp pair and their common band, across the face of the copyboard synchronously with the movement of the carriage. The light scanning assembly further includes an additional illuminating lamp mounted with its associated reflector on a second bracket secured to the first bracket for movement therewith but, pivotally coupled thereto for independent rotation across the surface of the copy board. This additional lamp is energized only when a transparent master or original is carried by the copyboard and the first pair of lamps are not energized. The second bracket is pivotable to rotate said additional lamp and associated reflector along a predetermined arc during the vertical translation thereof so that the light emitted therefrom is focused along a straight line continuously directed to the center of the optical train so that the image always is in focus. A cam wheel on the bracket follows a canted or tapered guide surface formed on a vertically arranged leg supporting said light scanning assembly to effect pivoting of the said bracket, return of the bracket being effected solely by gravity.
