# Method for selective preparation of cis isomers of ethylenically unsaturated compounds.

## Abstract
The cis isomer of a disubstituted ethylenically unsatu rated compound is prepared by hydrogenating the corres ponding acetylenic compound under pressure in the pres ence of water, a hydroxide or basic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, and a palladium catalyst borne on an alumina carrier and partially inactivated with a poisoning element selected from zinc, lead and tin, the weight of pal ladium in the catalyst being from 3 to 15 based on the total weight of the catalyst.
