# IMPROVED BUILDING BLOCKS

## Abstract
A building block has an inner and an outer wall defining a cavity therebetween, the two walls being interconnected by two or more webs positioned intermediate the top and bottom of the block to provide upper and lower horizontal channels. The walls at the top each have a longitudinal projection extenaing along an inner portion which in a building locates the blocks by being positioned in the lower hori ontal channel. The block has two end portions which are either both a female recess or a male protrusion so that the block can be reversed if necessary. A building is formed by using a pluralitv of double male and double female blocks and interlocking them together, load being transmitted to below through the outer portions of the inner and outer walls.
