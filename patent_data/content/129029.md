# Low contamination closure for blood collection tubes.

## Abstract
A composite closure arrangement is provided for blood sample collection tubes, and particularly evacuated blood collection tubes for reducing exposure of a technician to any blood droplets or blood aerosol during removal of a sample of the blood from the container. The device also hides and con tains any such aerosol or droplets. Moreover, the device pro vides enhanced ease of removal of the stopper, when desired. A cap 30 is configured to be placed over and fitted onto the rubber stopper 18 of the tube 12 with the top portion 71 of the cap extending over and spaced from the top 35 of the stopper to define a cavity 32 between the overlying portion of the cap and the top of the stopper The center of the over lapping portion of the cap includes a sample needle access bore 38 providing access to the stopper diaphragm 41 Cooperating opposed abutments on the cap and the stopper maintain the cap on the stopper.
