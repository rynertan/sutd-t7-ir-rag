# Control apparatus for an on demand ink jet printing element.

## Abstract
In an ink jet printing element in which the drop is expelled by generating a current pulse through the ink in the nozzle, in order to reduce the control voltage, a first pulse Tr for heat ing the ink is generated, followed by a vaporization pulse Tv with a delay such as to make the printing position indepen dent of the direction of movement of the element with respect to the paper. The heating pulse Tr is generated by a circuit 31 controlled by a temperature sensor 34 so that the dura tion of the heating pulse has a negative temperature coeffi cient. The vaporization pulse Tv is generated by a circuit 32 manually controlled potentiometer 39 to determine the pulse duration on the basis of the desired strength of the printing. The delay between the two pulses is controlled by a delay circuit 38 , e.g. a monostable circuit. The two pulses are applied to a transformer 35 which generates the voltage between the electrodes. The two circuits 31, 32 may be constituted by one monostable circuit with separate RC net works sequentially enabled for determining the durations of the heating and vaporization pulses.
