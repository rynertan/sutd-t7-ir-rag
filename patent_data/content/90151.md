# Compositions convertible to reinforced conductive components and articles incorporating same.

## Abstract
Electrically und or thermally conductive reinforced compositions convertible to reinforced components are dis closed. The compositions comprise a polymeric material of little or no conductivity and high strength, metal plated composite fibers having a conductive semi metallic core and a thin, firmly adhered layer of an electrodepositable metal coating on said core. The metal coated composite fibers will not lose their conductive coatings during normal processing and provide conductivity without reducing the physical properties of the polymeric material. The com positions of the invention are convertible to conductive com ponents such as laminate prepregs, surface plys for lami nates, conductive adhesives, conductive inks, and conduc tive elastomeric gaskets. The components can be incor porated in improved articles such as structural parts for transportation vehicles, printed circuit boards, lighting shields and molded articles.
