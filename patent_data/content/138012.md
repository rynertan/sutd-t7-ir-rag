# Manufacturing process for plate or forging of ferrite austenite two phase stainless steel.

## Abstract
This invention to a process for producing a plate or forging bar, stamp work or the like , of ferrite austenite two phase stainless steel, containing at most 0.03 C, at most 2.0 Si, at most 2.0 Mn, 25 to 35 Cr, 6 to 15 Ni, at most 0.35 N, remainder Fe and inevitable impurities with or without the addition of 0.001 to 0.030 B with the following nickel balance value specified at 13 to 9 Ni balance value Ni 0.5 Mn 30 C N 1.1 Cr 1.5 Si 8.2 The process of the invention is characterized in that the average crystal grain size is controlled to at most 0.015 mm by heating an ingot of the above mentioned ferrite austenite two phase stainless steel at a temperature of at most 1,200 C and keeping the forging ratio by hot working at a value of at least 5.
