# ROM with redundant ROM cells employing a highly resistive polysilicon film for programming the cells.

## Abstract
The present invention comprises a unique FET with resistor 5 in its drain lead of undoped polysilicon which may be characterized by high resistance in the absence of the application of a biasing voltage across the FET and the resistor when the FET is conducting, which biasing voltage irreversibly changes the resistor to a high state of conductiv ity thereby selectively providing the two logic states. This device may comprise a redundant cell for a ROM memory.
