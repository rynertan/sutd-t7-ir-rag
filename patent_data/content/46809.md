# NAIL.

## Abstract
Nail with a strengthened removal preventing force. Most of conventional nails are provided with a removal preventing means such as a spiral groove or annular grooves formed on the end of the shank thereof. When a base material into which the conventional nail is driven is a porous soft substance such as foamed concrete, the removal preventing means of these previous types do not provide a sufficient removal preventing force and little removal preventing effect is expected. This nail includes a pair of shanks 1 , 1 longitudinally confronting each other with a bank like metal plate 2 therebetween, the ends of the shanks 1 , 1 being formed with tapered surfaces 5 on the insides. Thus, when the nail is driven into a base material 9 , the shanks 1 , 1 are gradually diverged into the base material 9 , while the metal plate 2 is compressed and deformed in a zigzag shape to thereby retain the expanding action of the shanks 1 , 1 from the inside and to engage the shanks 1 , 1 in the base material 9 , thereby preventing the removal of the nail and strengthening the removal preventing force of the nail. Further, the nail also includes a tightening ring 7 disposed around both shanks 1 , 1 and the metal plate 2 , thereby preventing the shanks 1 , 1 from expanding on the surface of the base material 9 and thus aiding the shanks 1 , 1 to penetrate deep into the base material 9 as well as preventing the nail hole on the surface of the base material 9 from expanding.
