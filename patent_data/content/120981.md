# Resin encapsulation type semiconductor device.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a highly reliable resin encapsulation type semiconductor device excellent humidity resistance as well as high temperature electric characteristics. The specific feature consists in the epoxy resin composition employed for encapsulation. This composition comprises a novolac type epoxy resin, a novolac type phenol resin, an organic phos phine compound and an organic phosphorus acid compound. The resin encapsulation type semiconductor device is markedly small in leak current under hot an humid conditions and has a prolonged life due to difficult deterioration through corrosion of electrodes and aluminum wiring, as compared with those of prior art.
