# An anti pollution floating barrier having main floating elements to be used as containers for the collection, transport and launching of the barrier sections.

## Abstract
The barrier of this invention is formed by barrier sec tions and each of them can be wound up about a reel or bobbin, which is pivotably mounted within a main floating hollow element, which not only has the task of receiving, transporting, towing, launching and trawling the barrier section housed therein, but also it serves to provide anchor ing points for this barrier. Each main barrier element is shaped in the form of a cage like container provided with at least a side vertical entrance passage, through which a barrier section can be returned inside the container, or this section can be caused to come out, each main floating element thus serving as floating container for the transport of at least one of the barrier sections to or from their use place.
