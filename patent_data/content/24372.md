## Description
P Lactam Antibiotics, their preparation and use This invention relates to certain 9 phenyldeoxyclavulanic acid derivatives to a method for their preparation and their use as anti bacterial and 6 lactamase inhibitory agents. British Patent Specification No. 1508977 discloses a compound of formula I EMI1.1 and salts thereof which are broad spectrum anti bacterial and ss lactamase inhibitory agents. This compound is now commonly referred to as clavulanic acid. We have now discovered a series of 9 phenyldeoxyclavulanic acid derivatives which besides being broad spectrum anti bacterial agents and inhibitors of ss lactamase enzymes have a particularly favourable level of activity against Staphylococci and B. coli. The compounds are therefore of value in the treatment of bacterial infections in man and animals, particularly domestic animals such as cattle, pigs and poultry, especially where the infection is caused by a ss lactamase producing strain of bacteria or where the causal organism. is either of the two notably susceptible organisms mentioned above.The compounds are also useful as disinfectants for mineral oils. To whichever of the above medicinal uses the 9 phenyldeoxyclavulanic acid derivatives of this invention are put, they may be used either alone or with a penicillin or cephalosporin to enhance the activity of these latter antibiotics against resistant microorganisms. Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of formula II EMI2.1 and salts and esters thereof wherein the hydroxyl group occupies position 2 or 4 R1 and R2 may be the same or different and represent hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, lower alkoxy or R1 and R2 when on adjacent carbon atoms may together represent a 1,4 buta 1,3 dienylene group or a polymethylene group containing from 3 to 5 carbon atoms When used herein lower alkyl and lower alkoxy mean alkyl and alkoxy groups containing up to four carbon atoms. Examples of suitable lower alkyl groups falling within the definition of R1 and R2 include methyl and ethyl. Examples of suitable lower alkoxy groups within the definition of R1 and R2 are methoxy and ethoxy. Examples of suitable halogen atoms within the definition of R1 and R2 are fluorine, chlorine and bromine, particularly fluorine and chlorine. One example of a polymethylene group which R1 and R2 may represent is trimethylene. Most suitably R1 is hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy and R2 is hydrogen. Preferably R1 and R2 are both hydrogen. The compounds of this invention fall into two sub groups depending upon the position of the hydroxyl moiety. The first such sub group is of formula IIa EMI3.1 and salts and esters thereof wherein R1 and R2 are as previously defined with reference to formula II . Example of this class of compounds are 9 2 hydroxy phenyldeoxyclavulanic acid, 9 2 hydroxy napth l yldeoxyclavulanic acid, 9 6 hydroxy 2 methoxy phenyl deoxyclavulanic acid, 9 6 hydroxy 4 methoxy phenyl deoxyclavulanic acid, 9 2, 4 dihydroxy phenyldeoxyclavulanic acid, 9 2,6 dihydroxy phenyldeoxyclavulanic acid and 9 3 cyclohexyl 2 hydroxy phenyldeoxyclavulanic acid. The second such sub group is of formula IIb EMI4.1 and salts and esters thereof wherein R1 and R2.are as previously defined with reference to formula II above. Examples of this class of compounds are 9 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxy phenyldeoxyclavulanic acid and 9 3 cyclohexyl 4 hydroxy phenyldeoxyclaw acid. The compounds of the formula II are suitably provided in the form of the free acid. Alternatively the compounds of the formula II are provided in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula II include the alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassiur,alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium, and ammonium or substituted ammonium salts for example those with lower alkylamines such as triethylamine, hydroxylower alkylamines such as 2 hydroxyethylamine, bis 2 hydroxyethyl amine, tris hydroxymethyl amine or tris 2 hydroxyethyl amine, cycloalkylamines such as bicyclohexylamine, or with procaine, dibenzylamine,N,N dibenzylethylenediamine, l ephenamine, N ethylpiperidine, N benzyl P phenethylamine, dehydroabietylamine or N,N bis dehydroabietylethylenediamine. Thus suitable salts of this invention include the sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and ammonium salts, of these the sodium, potassium and calcium salts are favoured. The compounds of the formula II may be provided as in vivo hydrolysable esters. Such esters are those which hydrolyse in the human body to produce the parent acid. Suitable in vivo hydrolysable esters include those esters known to give in vivo hydrolysis in penicillins. Thus suitable esters include those of the formula i CO O CHRa O CO Rb i wherein Ra is a hydrogen atom, or a methyl or phenyl group Rb is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenyl group, an alkyl group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms substituted by a phenyl group, an alkoxy group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenoxy group, or an alkoxy group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms substituted by a phenyl group or Ra is attached to Rb to form a 1,2 diphenylene or 4,5 dimethoxy 1,2 diphenylene group. Favourably Ra is hydrogen. When Ra is hydrogen suitably Rb is selected from methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, tert butyl, phenyl, benzyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n propyloxy and isopropyloxy. Preferably Rb is tert butyl. Favourably Ra and Rb are joined so that the ester is a phthalidyl or 3,4 dimethoxyphthalidyl ester. Of these esters those favoured as in vivo hydrolysable esters are the acetoxymethyl, acetoxyethyl, phthalidyl, ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl esters. The in vivo hydrolysable nature of the ester may be confirmed by administration to an animal such as a mouse or rat and determination of the presence of a compound of the formula II or a salt thereof in the blood or urine of the animal. Alternatively hydrolysis in human blood or serum may be determined. It must be realised that salts of the compounds of the formula II formed with pharmaceutically unacceptable ions are useful as they may serve as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts by ion exchange, or they may be useful as intermediates in the preparation of in vivo hydrolysable esters. An example of such a salt is the lithium salt. It is appreciated that compounds II have at least two acidic groups viz the carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups, but when salts and esters of compounds II are referred to salts and esters of the carboxylic acid moiety only are intended. Compounds II may be prepared by arylating a clavulanic acid ester with a phenol in the presence of a Friedel Crafts catalyst. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula II above, or a salt or ester thereof, which process comprises arylating a clavulanic acid ester of formula III or a derivative thereof that allows arylation to take place EMI7.1 wherein R3is an ester forming group, with an appropriate phenol of formula IV EMI8.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined with reference to formula II and position 2 and or 4 is occupied by a hydrogen atom in the presence of a Friedel Crafts catalyst and thereafter a where desired de esterifying the ester of formula II to form a free acid or its salt b optionally salifying or esterifying the free carboxylic acid if formed in step a c optionally converting the salt if formed in step a into a free carboxylic acid or an ester. Any convenient ester of clavulanic acid may be used in the process of this invention. Since it is frequently desirable to form a salt of compounds II , the ester of clavulanic acid employed is preferably one which is readily. converted to the parent acid or its salt by mild methods of hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis. In a further aspect therefore the invention includes a process for preparing a salt or free acid of a compound 11 , which process comprises de esterifying an ester of Åa compound of formula 11 made by the process of this invention.Particularly suitable esters of clavulanic acid for use in this process include methoxymethyl clavulanate, or a clavulanic acid benzyl ester optionally substituted in the para position by a lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or nitro group or a halogen atom. A preferred ester for use in this process is benzyl clavulanate. The phenol IV chosen for use in this invention is determined by the particular deoxyclavulanic acid derivative selected for synthesis. Accordingly with reference to formula IV examples of suitable lower alkyl groups falling within the definition of R1 and R2 include methyl and ethyl examples of suitable lower alkoxy groups within the definition of R1 and R2 are methoxy and ethoxy and examples of suitable halogen atoms within the definition of R1 and R2 are fluorine, chlorine and bromine, particularly fluorine and chlorine. Most suitably R1 is hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy and R2 is hydrogen. Preferably R and R2 are both hydrogen. Examples of suitable Friedel Crafts catalysts include aluminium trichloride, zinc chloride, zinc bromide, antimony pentachloride, ferric chloride, stannic chloride and boron trifluoride etherate or its chemical equivalent, of which boron trifluoride etherate is preferred. The reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a solvent, though the identity of the particular solvent selected is not critical to the success of the reaction provided that it is able to form a homogeneous solution of the phenol and the clavulanic acid ester and is substantially inert to the starting materials, product and catalyst. Suitable solvents may be selected by trial and error. We have found generally that the reaction may be conveniently carried out in non polar organic solvents such as halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride and ethylene chloride. The temperature at which the reaction is carried out depends upon the particular ester and phenol which have been selected and upon the nature of the catalyst. Generally, the reaction is carried out at moderate temperatures to low temperatures, i.e. less than 500C and as low as 700C. In order to prevent side reactions, it is preferred to keep the temperature in the range 20 to OOC while the reaction is taking place. It is of course understood that best results are obtained when reactions of the type described here are carried out under an atmosphere of dry air or a dry inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. In à further aspect this invention provides a,process for the preparation of an ester of a compound of formula II as defined above which process comprises rearranging a compound of formula V EMI10.1 wherein E and R2 are as defined with reference to formula II and R3 is an ester forming group, liter the rearrangement step, where desired, the ester of the compound of formula IT so obtained may be converted into a free acid or a salt. The rearrangement is generally carried out by heating a solution of compound of formula V in an inert high boiling solvent to a moderately high temperature, i.e. generally higher than about 80 C but less than that at which any significant thermal de composition takes place. Generally the temperature is in the range of 1000 1500C. . Convenient solvents for this process include high boiling aromatic hydrocarbons such as high boiling mono , di , or tri lower alkyl benzenes,examples of which include toluene, zylene and cumene. Xylene is a particularly convenient solvent since it has a boiling point of 1400C and the reaction may conveniently be carried out in this solvent under reflux. The time for which the reaction is allowed to proceed depends upon the particular starting material selected, but a suitable time period may be easily determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction by for example, high pressure liquid chromatography or more simply by thin layer chromatography on silica using for example ethyl acetate cyclohexane as a developing solvent. R3 may represent any convenient ester group forming group but since it is frequently desirable to form a salt of compounds II the group R3 employed is preferably one such that the compound II is readily converted into the parent acid or its salt by mild methods of hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis. Particularly suitable esters of compounds V for use in this process include the methoxymethyl ester. or a benzyl ester optionally substituted in the para position by a lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, or nitro group or a halogen atom. A preferred ester for use in this process is the benzyl ester. The groups R1 and R2 in compounds V are selected according to the requirements of the compound II to be produced. In a further aspect the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula II wherein a hydroxyl group is at the 2 position which process comprises reacting a compound of formula III EMI11.1 wherein P3 is the residue of an ester group witn a phenol of formula IV EMI11.2 wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and are defined as in relation to formula II , in the presence of a compound of the formula VI R40.CO.N N.CO.OR5 VI wherein R4 and P5 are independently lower alkyl, lower alkylaryl or aryl and a compound of the formula VII EMI12.1 wherein 1, m and n are independently 0 or 1 and R6, R7 and R8 are each independently a lower alkyl, lower alkyl aryl or aryl group thereafter a where desired de esterifying the.ester of formula tII so formed to form a free acid or its salt b optionally salifying or esterifying the free carboxylic acid formed in step a c optionally converting the salt formed in step a into a free carboxylic acid or an ester. The esters of clavulanic acid which may be used in this process are precisely the same as those which may be used in the Friedel Craft process and the rearrangment process described above. A preferred ester for use in this process is benzyl clavulanate. Suitable compounds of the formula VI include those wherein the R6, R7 and P8 groups are selected from methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, benzyl, phenyl and methoxyphenyl groups. It is generally convenient that R6, R7 and R8 are the same. Favoured compounds of the formula VI include triarylphosphines and trialkylphosphites. Particularly suitable compounds of the formula VI include triphenylphosphine, trimethylphosphite and triethylphosphite. A further particularly suitable compound of the formula VI is tri p methoxyphenylphosphine. Suitable compounds of the formula V include those wherein R4 and R5 are independently selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, phenyl, benzyl and like groups. It is generally convenient that R4 and P5 are the same. Particularly suitable compounds of the formula V include those wherein R4 and P5 each represent an ethyl or t butyl group. In general, roughly equal molar equivalents of the reagents are employed in the process of this invention. The reaction is performed in an inert organic solvent. The solvent used should be aprotic and unreactive towards the reagents involved. Suitable solvents include tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate and the like. Other solvents include l,2 dimethoxyethane and benzene. A particularly suitable solvent for the process of this invention is tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is normally carried out at a non extreme temperature such as 600C to 1000C, more usually from about 50C to about 500C, for example at approximately ambient temperature such as about 120C to 250C . For those reactions using a compound of the formula VI wherein 1, m, and n are each 0, the reaction is generally complete within a short time, for example normally within 2 hours, usually within 30 minutes and frequently almost immediately. For those reactions using a compound of the formula VI wherein 1, m and n are each 1, longer reaction times are required, for example up to 24 hours. The reaction of the compounds of the formula II , IV , VI and VIZ as hereinbefore defined may also lead to the preparation of an ester of a compound of formula V , wherein R1 and R2 are defined in relation to a compound of formula II . It is to be understood that a number of components are obtained as a result of this process, and that skilled and careful chromatographic techniques are to be employed to isolate the desired products. Compounds of formula V may be separated from compounds of formula II by gradient elution chromatography increasing polarity on silica gel in the first instance, followed by either high pressure liquid chromatography or further column chromatography as appropriate to the chromatographic qualities of the mixture. The ester of the compound II produced in any of these processes may be isolated by any standard method such as fractional crystallisation, counter current separation or chromatography. We have found that it is most convenient to separate the desired product by column chromatography. Esters of compounds II may be de esterified by conventional methods such as hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis. Suitable methods for hydrolysing esters of compounds II include mild base hydrolysis in aqueous solution.The reaction may be effected by maintaining the ester at a pH of 7.5 to 9.5 until hydrolysis is complete. Most suitably a readily hydrolysable ester such as the methoxymethyl ester is employed in this process. The pH may be maintained in the desired range in a pH stat by the addition of a solution of a base such as LiOH, NaOH, KOH,NaHC03 or the like at a rate that prevents accumulation of excess base which would cause the pH to increase unacceptably or by the use of a suspension of finely divided Ca OH 2, Mg OH 2, MgO, MgC03 or the like. Other bases which may be employed for hydrolysis include Ba OH 2,Sr OH 2 and the like. Suitable methods of hydrogenolysis of esters of compounds II include hydrogenation in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. Suitable hydrogenolysable esters are benzyl and substituted benzyl esters discussed above. The pressure of hydrogen used in the reaction may be low, medium or high but in general an approximately atmospheric or slightly super atmospheric pressure of hydrogen is preferred. The transition metal catalyst employed is preferably palladium on charcoal.The hydrogenation may be effected in any inert solvent in which the ester is soluble such as tetrahydrofuran or the like. If this hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a base then a salt of compounds II is produced.Suitable bases for inclusion include NaHC03, KHC03, Na2C03, K2C03, CaC03, MgC03, LiHC03, NHqOCOCH3, Mg OCOCH3 2, Mg OCOH 2 and the like. If no base is present then hydrogenation leads to the preparation of an acid within formula II which may then be neutralised if desired to yield a salt. Suitable bases which may be used to neutralise acids within formula II include LiOH,NaOH, NaHC03, KOH, Ca OH 2, Ba OH 2, MgO, Mg OH 2, NH40H and N C2H5 3. The lithium salts within formula II tend to be more easily prepared in pure crystalline form than other salts of compounds II . It is therefore often convenient to first form the lithium salt and then convert this into a further salt by ion exchange, for example by passing a solution of the lithium salt through a bed of a cation exchange resin in sodium, potassium, calcium1 ammonium or like form. Suitable cation exchange resins includeAmberlite IR 120 and equivalent resins. The salts of acid II may be converted to esters in conventional manner, for example by reaction with a reactive halide in solution in dimethylformamide or like solvent. Esters may similarly be prepared by the reaction in an inert solvent of an acid II with an alcohol in the presence of a condensation promoting agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. In general salts of the compounds II above may be prepared from the free acid by known methods as disclosed in British Patent Specification No. 1508977 for the preparation of clavulanic acid salts. Similarly, esters of compounds II are prepared from the free acid by known methods as disclosed in British Patent Specification No.1508978 for the preparation of clavulanic acid esters. In order to use the compounds II and their pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable salt and esters in human or veterinary medicine, these compounds are formulated as pharmaceutical compositions for human or veterinary use in accordance with standard pharmaceutical procedures. Accordingly the present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a compound of formula II or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptablec er. Suitable forms of the compositions of this invention include tablets, capsules, creams, syrups, suspnsions, solutions, reconstitutable powders and sterile forms suitable for injection or infusion. Such compositions may contain conventional pharmaceutically acceptable materials such as diluents, binders, colours, flavours, preservatives, disintegrants and the like in accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice in the manner well understood by those skilled in the art of formulating antibiotics. Injectable or infusable compositions of salts of a compound of the formula II are particularly suitable as high tissue levels of a compound of the formula II can occur after administration by injection or infusion.Thus, one preferred composition aspect of this invention comprises a salt of a compound of the formula II in sterile form. Unit dose compositions comprising a compound of the formula II or a salt or ester thereof adapted for oral administration form a further preferred aspect of this invention.

Such compounds are frequently used in the form of a salt or hydrate. Naturally if the penicillin or cephalosporin present in the composition is not suitable for oral administration then the composition will be adapted for parenteral administration. When present in a pharmaceutical composition together with a penicillin or cephalosporin, the ratio of a compound of the formula II or its salt or ester present to penicillin or cephalosporin present may vary over a wide range of ratios, for example 3 1 to 1 10 and advantageously may be from 2 1 to 1 5 for example, 1 1 to 1 3. The total quantity of antibacterial agents present in any unit dosage form will normally be between 50 and 1500 mg and will usually be between 100 and 1000 mg. Compositions of this invention may be used for the treatment of infections on inter alia, the respiratory tract, the urinary tract and soft tissues and mastitis in cattle. Normally between 50 and 3000 mg of the compounds of the invention will be administered each day of treatment but more usually between 100 and 1000 mg of the compounds of the invention will be administered per day, for example as 1 6 doses, more usually 2 4 doses. The penicillin or cephalosporin in synergistic compositions of this invention will normally be present up to or at approximately the amount at which it is conventionally used.

The materials present in such compositions may be hydrated if rdesired, for example ampicillin trihydrate or amoxycillin trihydrate may be employed. The weights of the antibiotics in such compositions are expressed on the basis of antibiotic theoretically available from the composition and not on the basis of the weight of pro drug.
