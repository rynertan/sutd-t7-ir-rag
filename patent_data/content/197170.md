# Storage stable, one package heat curable polyurethane adhesive compositions.

## Abstract
New and improved storage stable, one package, heat curable polyurethane adhesive compositions are disclosed which comprise a a mixture of or a prepolymer adduct of i an excess of a poly aliphatic isocyanate compound of the formula The compositions are curable upon exposure to elevated temperatures of from about 100 200 C to form high tensile strength, high adhesive strength bonds to a variety of substrates. The compositions have extended pot lives of up to six weeks and exhibit storage stability for up to six months.
