# Hub for tape reels.

## Abstract
A hub for a tape reel used for web material such as magnetic recording tape is disclosed. The reel may be advantageously employed in a reel to reel magnetic tape transport where magnetic tape is wound under tension that is converted to radial forces which subject layers of the tape disposed over discontinuities associated with the reel hub to adversely affect the transducing relationship between the reading head and the recording surface of the tape. The section of the cylindrical tape receiving surface 16 which is associated with a discontinuity is formed to function as a cantilever beam 25A, 25B with the distal end 28, 29 of the beam being capable of radial inward bending when tape is wound on the hub. The outer portion 11 of the hub is made of relatively compressible material, while the inner portion 10 is relatively solid. Compressibility of the outer portion is enhanced by providing a plurality of circum ferentially disposed cylindrically shaped openings 21 which also function to relieve radially induced forces on the tape layers.
