# Device for luminous scenographies with looking on pair of hemispherical caps turning in the inverse sense in synchronism with the supporting frame.

## Abstract
A pair of hemispheric caps 12, 13 is foreseen supported on an annular inside frame, rotating in the inverse sense in synchronism with the assembly rotation. Spotlights are employed fitted on the envelopes, the polychromous ray pencils of which, coming from parts having different movements, generate dynamic projection effects with different interference. The cap motion is given by a motor 14 inside fitted on the frame annular turning a conical gear 15 engaged on a pair of line conical gears 16, 17 driving a relevant shaft pair 6, 7 supporting them, stabilized on bearings with frame settlers to the rotation only. The assembly rotation is possible through another gear 18 engaged in opposition to the first one 15 on the two line gears 16, 17 driving a Cardan joint 20 fitted on the frame and turning on its stationary support.

## Description
Device for luminous scenographies with looking on pair of hemispherical caps turning in the inverse sense in synchronism with the supporting frame .The invention refers to an assembly turning with three movements of dynamic luminous scenographies, which substahtially employs a looking on pair of hemispheric caps, fitted on the annular frame inside it, rotating in inverse sense in synchronism with the assembly one.The scenographic animation si possible thanks to spotlights included in the envelopes of the two hemispheres and projecting integral from the relevant walls with the projection collars these ones being fitted on spherical surfaces, are determining ray pencils all with different trimming. The said light pencils foreseen with several colours fitted on two parts hav m g three different movements, generate effects of dynamic projection with different interference one with another giving rise to phantasmagorical room scenographies.The said turning assembly represents an industrial advancement in respect to the pre sent mobile devices for spotlight support, because these ones only drive the ray pencils constantly which, however, maintain their relevant positions and, therefore, do not give rise to interferences in their chromatisms. The inverse sense rotation of the caps is possible through a driving assembly fitted inside the frame annular structure which, in a central position in the said frame, rotates a conical gear engaging a transversal horizontal pair of line of other analogous gears, the axle of which passes through the centre of the said assembly. These gears drive cor responding shafts which are stabilized for the rotation only on the bearing foreseen on radial settlers integral on the two sides of the annular frame and, by means of blocking parts on their ends, are supporting the two screwed on caps.The assembly can rotate by means of another conical gear engaged in opposition to the first one driven by the motor assembly and engaged in the two line gears by transmission, a Cardan joint fitted on the frame is driven which turns on the stationary support bearing it.A not limiting execution form is illustrated by the drawings of Table I where Fig. I is the perspective view of the rotating assembly showing the inside frame borne by a stationary support, between the looking on hemispherical caps, on the settling box, by means of anchoring flanges on the plane or on the ceiling. On the two caps, the collars of the stA bilized projectors can be noted on the two envelopes.Fig. 2 is the longitudinal section of the rotating assembly showing the group of the four conical gears enclosed in the frame driving the synchro nical movement of the two hemispheres and of the device. Fig. 3 is the transversal section showing the settling of the two supporting and rota ting devices for the two hemispheres on the line. Fig. 4 is the side view of the annular frame to show one of the three arm stabilizers, which centrally supports a settling bearing of the relevant supporting arm of a hemisphere.In a version, the rotating assembly employs annular I of frame with side three arm stabiliser 2 and 3, which centrally support bearings 4and 5 for stabilising only the arm pair 6 and 7 on en thread ed cavities 8 and 9, these arms support hemispherical caps I2 and I3 by means of screws IO and II. The movement is given by the motor assembly I4 which drives conical gear 15 engaged on the line gears I6 and I7 integral with shafts 6 and 7 for rotating caps I2 and I3. The assembly is driven by the cinematic chain on gear 18 which, by means of shaft I9, drives Cardan joint 20. The device is supported on column 21 of stationary part integral with the flanged box 22. On the plate envelopes of the hemispheric caps, annulars 23 of the projectors are foreseen, with ray pencils of different colours. Practically, the particulars of execution the materials for the hemisphere manufacture, the transmission and movement determination devices, the number and type of the spotlights and everything else on order may be executed in different ways.
