# Method and apparatus for determining the mass of an impacting object.

## Abstract
Determination of the mass of loose parts in the primary cooling system of the nuclear reactor is important in assessing potential damage. However, prior art systems could not give information on the weight of the loose part. This invention uses an acoustic transducer to generate an impact signal which has a unique signature represented by its frequency spectrum. It generates under predetermined conditions with objects, each of definite weight and form, a series of impact signals for reference purposes that are stored in a read only memory device 13 . Then, the stored reference impact signals are read out one at a time and correlated with an actual impact signal from an unknown impacting object by comparing the frequency spectra 12 , thereby to indirectly recognize the impacting object.
