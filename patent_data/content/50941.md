## Description
TEMPERATURE CONTROL APPARATUS FOR CONVECTION OVEN SPECIFICAtION This invention relates to temperature control apparatus for a convection oven for cooking and or defrosting food by recirculating heated air. Background of the Invention Typically temperature controls in countertop ovens sample and measure the air temperature within the oven cooling chamber during cooking or defrosting a food product. Monitoring of the air temperature in the oven does not take into account the fact that the surface temperature and the internal temperature of the food may differ greatly depending upon the consistency of the food. For example, meat may be wart to the touch and look defrosted on its external surface but in reality is still frozen at its centre.Therefore the standard internal air temperature sensing devices of countertop ovens lack the ability either to defrost or cook foods accurately to a desired temperature. Some countertop ovens, e.g. microwave ovens, have achieved greater temperature control for cooking and or defrosting by adding a probe like apparatus with a temperature sensitive device in the probe for use in connection with the temserature control system.While these devices may have accounted for a degree of increased reliability in sensing temperature accurately, none provide for the detection of a malfunction of the temperature sensing element. In addition, most of the probe temperature sensing circuits are used in connection with browning elements to give the food an exterior appearance similar to one achieved in a conventional gas or electric cooking oven. Most countertop ovens defrost food by using a timing mechanism to control whatever type of heating element is used in that particular oven. This method is not particularly accurate, especially for meat products, because while certain meats may weigh the same their shape and size can vary the amount of time necessary either to defrost or cook such a product.Of course, the food product does not have to be meat.The food to be cooked or defrosted may be any one of a variety of foodstuffs such as casseroles, pastries, fish, etc. Summary of the Invention To achieve increased reliability and accuracy in cooking and or defrosting food in an oven of the convection air type a low voltage signal temperature control circuit is added to the standard line voltage thermostatic temperature control. In a convection air type oven, which cooks and or defrosts food by recirculating heated air, a temperature control means has been added for monitoring the actual internal temperature of the food being cooked and or defrosted.This temperature controL means is operable within a predetermined temperature range from an initial temperature of approximately OOC. to a desired internal food temperature between 370 and 940C. 1000 to 2000F. . The temperature control means comprises a temperature sensing means, a temperature selection means, and circuitry responsive to signals from the temperature sensing means and the temperature selection means for controlling the heating apparatus of the oven. The temperature sensing means uses a thermistor embedded in the tip of a stainless steel probe which is inserted into the food for measuring the actual internal temperature of that food. The probe is adapted to be removably connected to the oven. When connected to the oven the circuitry responds to the signals from the temperature sensing means and the temperature selection means to control the switching of the oven heating element on or off. If operation of the oven is desired without the probe, the temperature control circuit has means for permitting such operation using the line voltage thermostatic control. An additional signal indicative of a normally functioning or a malfunctioning temperature sensing means is fed into this circuit so that if the temperature sensing means malfunctions the oven will immediately shut off. While the oven is on, a lamp so indicating is lit. Whenever the oven shuts off the lamp is extinguished and an audible alarm sounds indicating that the oven has shut off. For the purpose of illustrating the invention, there is shown in the drawings an embodiment of the invention which is presently preferred. It should be understood however that the invention is not limited to the precise arrangement shown. In the drawings Figure 1A is a schematic representation of part of the temperature control circuit of the present invention. Figure lB is a schematic representation of the remainder of the temperature control circuit of the present invention. Figures 1A and 1B, when considered together, provide a complete schematic of the temperature control circuit. Figure 2 is a perspective view of the probelike temperature sensing means, cable and connector of the present invention. The present invention is best understood by referring to the drawings wherein like numerals indicate like elements. The oven of the present invention may be the oven described in U.S. Patent No. 3,828,760 which description is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Referring to Figure 2, the temperature sensing means of the present invention comprises a probe like device 10 comprising a stainless steel probe 12, handle 14, cable 16, and connector 18. The moulded parts such as the handle 14 and the connector 18 and the outer jacket of the cable 16 are made from materials which areFDA approved for use in food preparing apparatus and capable of continuous operation at 2320C. 4500F Any suitable material meeting these conditions could be used to form the above listed elements of the probe. The outer insulation of the cable 16 should have a thickness to withstand normal household use and able to withstand closure in an oven door without loss of operation.The cable 16 should measure approximately 292 mm between the handle 14 and the connector 18 to allow for partially removing the food from the oven without disconnecting the probe. The external sleeving or outer jacket of the cable 16 should be secured both to the connector 18 and to the handle 14 to prevent the sleeving from riding up over the conductors in the cable. The stainless steel probe 12 is a hollow tube tapering at one end to a point 20. Mounted internally of the point 20 is a temperature sensitive device such as a thermistor capable of withstanding 232 0C. for at least one hour without loss of operation. The temperature sensitive device is electrically and mechanically fastened to the internal surface of the tip 20 of the stainless steel probe 12 so as to be able to respond to temperature changes of the outside environment. The temperature sensitive device or thermistor is electrically connected to a signal wire within the cable 16 using high temperature solder. The cable 16 is provided with a braided outer shield to minimise rf signal pick up and is fed through the handle 14 to be electrically and mechanically attached to the.probe 12. The opposite end of the cable 16 is connected to the connector 18 by fastening the braided shield of the cable to the barrel or ground strap and the signal wire to the tip of the connector 18. The entire assembly, probe and connector should bemdde of material sufficiently unbreakable as to withstand drops from a height of1.22 metres 4 feet to a plastics tile floor over cement and be sealed against water or other liquid immersion and moisture penetration such as during normal. household cleaning, including being placed in a dishwasher. The connector 18 is configured to plug into a mating receptacle which may be located at any point along the side walls of the oven but preferably at a location just inside the door on the right side panel towards the top of the opening. The receptacle 32, shown only in the schematic in Figure LA, is connected directly to the temperature control circuit associatedwith with the probe. Referring now to Figures IA and lB, the temperature control circuit illustrated therein operates at a low voltage, 12 volts dc, rather thdn at line voltage as typical thermostatic controls in countertop ovens. The circuit receives its power from a transformer 22 with its primary winding connected to line voltage of approximately 120 volts ac. The transformer secondary winding provides 17 volts ac to a full wave rectifier Dl. The full wave rectifier D1 provides 17 volts dc to a voltage regulator VR1 which provides a fixed output voltage of 12 volts dc to the circuit. The voltage regulator may be any fixed output voltage type integrated circuit device currently available which will provide the desired voltage. The ground leg of the regulator is in parallel with a capacitor C1 having a value of 470 pf, for eliminating transients at the output of the rectifier. At the output of voltage regulator VP1 the circuit is divided into separate paths. The first path proceeds through diodes D2, D3 and continues across the resistive bridge network comprising resistors R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9. These resistors have values of 10K, lOK, 30K, 30K, and 470K ohms, respectively. The resistive network establishes a reference voltage of 10.6 volts at the junction of R6,R7 and R9. The path continues through resistor R10 having a value of 1K ohms to the non inverting input of differential amplifier 26 to be more fully described hereinafter. The second path from the voltage regulator VR1 proceeds through diodes D4, D5 to another resistive bridge network. The resistive bridge network comprises resistors Rll, R12, R13 and R15. The values for these resistors are 29.4K, 10.2K, 10.2K, and29.4Kohms,respectively These resistors are selected to vary only 1 from their stated value. This resistive bridge network provides a voltage of 7.9 volts at the junction of R11,R13, R14 and R15. Resistor R14 has a value of 1K ohms and is connected to the non inverint input of the oper ational amplifier 24. The probe assembly 10 is connected to the temperature control circuit by receptacle 32. The shield of the cable 16 is connected to the collar 34 and grounded. The conducting wire from the thermistor is connected to the spring contact 36 through the tip of the connector 18. Fixed contact 38 of the receptacle 32 is connected through resistor R4, having value of lOOK ohms, to ground.The relationship between the spring contact 36 and the fixed contact 38 is such that when connector 18 is not present and the probe assembly 10 is detached from the oven, resistor R4 connects the junction of Rill, R12 of the resistive bridge networkRll R15 to ground. When the probe assembly 10 is inserted into the receptacle 32 spring contact 36 moves away from fixed contact 38 by the force of the tip of connector 18 isolating resistor R4 and placing the thermistor with its variable resistance into the circuit.The specific function of resistor R4 will be more fully described hereinafter. The circuit includes four operational amplifiers 24, 26, 28 and 30, each connected as a differential amplifier. The first differential amplifier 24 has a feedback loop connecting its output to its inverting input. Such configuration makes the differential amplifier 24 a voltage follower with unitary gain providing an output voltage equal to the input voltage.Therefore, the voltage of 7.9 volts is passed along the output path from the differential amplifier 24 to the temperature selection means comprising potentiometer R17.There is little if any voltage drop across resistor R14 because of the high input impedance of amplifier 27. Potentiometer R17 has a variable resistance between 0 and 20K ohms and is connected in series with trim resistor R19 and resistor R20 to ground. Potenti ometer R17 is connected so as to make the voltage across it proportional to the temperature scale of the temperature control knob. Variable trim resistor R19 having a value of 10K ohms is used to calibrate potentiometerR17. Resistor R20 has a value of 15K ohms. Adjusting the potentiometer R17 gives rise to a voltage drop acrossR18, such that the voltage at the non inverting input of differential amplifier 28 is in the range of 4 to 7.9 volts. Resistor R18 has a value of 20K ohms. While the signal wire from the thermistor is connected through the contact 36 to the Rll, R12 junction in the resistive network comprising resistors Rll R15, it is also connected through resistor R16, having a value of 1K ohms, to the inverting inputs of differential amplifier 26, 28. Capacitor C3, having a value of .01 pf, is connected between the non inverting input of differential amplifier 28 and ground in order to provide a time delay for reducing any possible relay chatter. Considering first differential amplifier 28, the voltage from the temperature selection means resistor R17 having a range between 4 and 7.9 volts is applied to its non inverting input. A voltage proportional to the resistance of the thermistor, slightly delayed by theR C time delay network of R16, C3, appears at the inverting input of the differential amplifier 28. A feedback resistor R27 having a value of 20M ohms is connected between the output of differential amplifier 28 and its non inverting input. Differential amplifier 28 will provide an output voltage having a range between .64 and 10.8 volts depending upon the difference value between its inputs. If the thermistor voltage signal to the inverting input exceeds the pre set temperature voltage signal to the non inverting input the lower range value will be outputted.If the value of the non inverting input exceeds the value of the inverting input a voltage value will be outputted from the differential amplifier 28 ranging upwards towards the upper limit of the range.The value of 10.8 volts will occur at the output of the differential amplifier 28 when the two inputs experience a maximum differential in value. Another capacitor C7, having a value of 100 uf, isconnedted between the output of differential amplifier 28 and ground for creating a second time delay to allow any transient voltages produced through differential amplifier 28 to settle out. The output voltage is connected through a voltage divider network having resistors R21, R22 and R24. These resistors are all valued at 15K ohms. The voltage divider network serves the purpose of isolating and stabilising the input voltage to the inverting input of differential amplifier 30. Referring now to differential amplifier 26 whose inverting input is connected in parallel with the inverting input of differential amplifier 28, this differential amplifier serves as a probe sensing circuit to detect malfunctioning of the thermistor. The reference voltage set by the resistive network having resistors R5 R9 and passing through resistor R10 is applied to the noninverting input of differential amplifier 26. Thus a voltage of 10.6 volts appears on the non inverting input and a variable voltage depending upon the presence or absence of the probe and the value of the thermistor appears on the inverting input. If the voltage value on the non inverting input of differential amplifier 26 exceeds the voltage value on the inverting input a voltage of 10.6 volts will be outputted signifying that the probe is present and the thermistor has a resistance value within its normal operating range. If the voltage value on the inverting input exceeds the voltage value on the non inverting input the differential amplifier 26 will output 0 volts. Thus, the differential amplifier 26 acts as a logic gate for determining the status of the thermistor. The output of differential amplifier 26 is connected through resistor R23 having a value of 15K ohms to the non inverting input of differential amplifier 30. The non inverting input of differential amplifier 30 is also tied to ground through resistor R25 having a value of 22K ohms.The purpose of resistorR25 is to stabilise the output of differential amplifier 26 by reducing transients and providing a stable voltage level to the input of differential amplifier 30. Differential amplifier 30 acts in a similar manner to differential amplifier 26 by comparing the voltage value of the non inverting input to the voltage value of the inverting input. If the value of the noninverting input exceeds the voltage value of the inverting input a voltage of 10.6 volts will be outputted.If the voltage value of the inverting input exceeds the voltage value of the non inverting inputthedifferential amplifier 30 will switch and output 0 volts. The output voltage from differential amplifier 30 controls the transistor switch 40 which in turn controls the relay 42. The output voltage of differential amplifier 30 is reduced through resistor R26 having a value of 4.7K ohms to provide a correct voltage Vbe for the transistor 40. The output voltage through the resistor R26 is stabilised by connecting resistor R29 having a value of 2.2K ohms from the base connection on the transistor 40 to ground. The diode D6 acts as a voltage clamp to protect the transistor 40. The transistor may be any of the NPN type transistors which are capable of switching 12 volts.The collector of the transistor 40 is connected through the coil 44 of the relay 42 to the voltage regulator VR1. The emitter of the transistor 40 is connected to ground. When switched on the transistor 40 will permit the coil 44 to conduct, thereby latching the relay and permitting the heating element of the oven to heat the air and cook and or defrost the food located within the cooking chamber. The oven of the present invention operates by switching an oven timer switch to either constant or timed on. This timer switch provides the return voltage path through the relay 42 for the line voltage applied through the heating element and the thermostatic control measuring oven air temperature. The oven thermostatic control monitors the air temperature in the cooking chamber in order to cycle the heating element on and off while the motor constantly recirculates the air as described in U.S. PatentNo. 3,828,760. The recirculating of the heated air and the cycling on and off of the heating element will continue throughout either the constant or timed oven on period provided by the oven timer switch. The present invention also provides for a supplementary temperature control circuit for monitoring the actual internal temperature of the foodstuff being cooked and or defrosted in the cooking chamber. This supplementary temperature control circuit, using the thermistor embedded in a probe tip inserted into the foodstuff, is capable of overriding the thermostatic control and the timer by using the relay 42 in order to shut the oven off when the food reaches the desired temperature. When such temperature is reached the probe temperature selection circuit switches off transistor 40 rendering relay coil 44 non conductive thus allowing relay 42 to return to its normally open condition.When relay 42 opens the oven heating element, motor and lamp indicator are shut off and an audible alarm begins to sound until the oven timer switch is returned to off.If it is desired to cook and or defrost a particular food without using the probe temperature sensing device 10 the probe temperature control circuit is provided with a resistor R4 which provides for a voltage sufficient to enable the transistor switch 40 to remain on allowing relay coil 44 to conduct so that the thermostatic control and the oven timer will control both the oven temperature and length of cooking time. The probe temperature control circuit is operable in two modes with the probe inserted, and with the probe detached. With the probe inserted resistor R4 is isolated and the thermistor embedded in the tip 20 of the probe 12 provides the variable resistance giving rise to a range of voltages. It should be noted that the material from which the thermistor is made decreases in resistive value as the temperature increases and vice versa. It is also important to realise that the thermistor must function within a temperature range between approximately OOC. and 10oOC. or a temperature equivalent to boiling. The resistance exhibited by the thermistor at different temperatures within the range will vary proportionately in a decreasingly linear fashion as temperature increases.As an example of the operation of the probe temperature control circuit with the probe inserted assume that the probe temperature selection control, potentiometer R17, has been set at 660C. 1500F. . Further, the actual internal temperature of 0 the food is approaching 66 C. and, therefore, the ther mistor would be approaching 10.2K ohms. The thermistor would provide a signal voltage of approximately 5.8 volts which is applied to the inverting inputs of differential amplifiers 26, 28. With the temperature selection control, potentiometer R17, set at its range value of 66 0C. a voltage of approximately 5.95 volts will appear at the non inverting input to differential amplifier 28.Since the voltage value of the non inverting input of differential amplifier 28 exceeds the voltage value of the inverting input a signal of approximately i0.8 volts will be outputted through resistor R22 and voltage divider R21, R24 and appear at the inverting input of differential amplifier 30 as approximately 7.6 volts. The differential amplifier 26 having a voltage value of approximately 5.8 volts on its inverting input and a voltage value of 10.4 volts on its noninverting input will output a voltage of approximately 10.6 volts indicating that the probe is functioning normally. The output voltage of 10.6 will appear at the non inverting input of differential amplifier 30 as approximately 6.4 volts.The input signal voltage value on the inverting input of differential amplifier 30 as it approaches 7.6 volts becomes sufficient to switch the output of the differential amplifier from its high of 10.6 volts to its low of 0 volts thus switching off the transformer switch 40. As the inverting input of differential amplifier 30 approaches the voltage value of 7.6 volts the closer the actual internal food temperature is to the selected tempera ture of 66 0C. Therefore as the 66 0C. temperature is achieved the transistor switch 40 ceases to conduct by being deprived of its base voltage which in turn renders the coil 44 non conductive releasing the relay armature and shutting off the oven heating element, motor and lamp. If the food being cooked and or defrosted is not capable of having its internal temperature measured by the probe or the use of the probe is not desired it may be detached from the receptacle in the oven wall thus returning resistor R4 to the circuit. Resistor R4 provides a fixed voltage of 9.6 volts for no probe operation of the oven. Therefore 9.6 volts will be applied to both inverting inputs of differential amplifiers 26,28 resulting in a voltage output from differential amplifier 26 of the same 10.6 volts signifying normal functioning of the probe and a voltage of .64 volts from differential amplifier 28. The non inverting input to differential amplifier 30 will remain at 6.4 volts and the inverting input will have a value of 4.25 volts when no probe is present in the oven.This makes the output of differential amplifier 30 go high to 10.6 volts thus creating a sufficient base to emitter voltage for the transistor 40 to switch on. With transistor 40 on, the coil 44 will conduct,latching the armature of relay 42 and rendering the oven heating element, motor and lamp susceptible to control by the thermostatic control and the oven timer switch. Thus, the probe temperature control circuit of the present invention provides for the temperature sensing of the actual internal temperature of the food being cooked.and or defrosted in the cooking chamber of the oven. The circuit also provides for a probe sensor to monitor either the normal functioning or the malfunctioning of the thermistor embedded in the probe tip. If the thermistor exceeds the preselected resistance range the sensor will change outputs signifying such malfunction. The change in output will cause a transistor switch to turn off allowing a relay to spring back to its normally open position turning off the oven and initiating an audible alarm. If it is desired to operate the oven without the probe the detaching of the probe from its receptacle in the wall of the oven will not render the oven temperature control circuit inoperative. A provision has been made to enable the probe temperature control circuit to continur in operation keeping the transistor switch turned on in order to retain the relay in its latched position to allow the oven to be susceptible to control by the thermostatic temperature control and the oven timer.
