# Positioning system employing feedforward and feedback control.

## Abstract
A positioning system for moving a member 10 between positions in time optimal fashion employs concurrent feedforward and feedback control. The feedforward control system 20 provides coarse control and the feedback control system 21, 23, 24 provides fine control to correct for deviations between the actual and a nominal system. The feedback loop may thus be of low bandwidth permitting desensitization to high frequency disturbances or the employement of inherently low bandwidth controlled variables The feedforward control function includes successive portions of opposite polarity corresponding to acceleration and decleration of the member and also includes a subtractive velocity related component. This function represents the approximate input to an electromagnetic coil actuator 12 of a nominal system required to move such a member between positions in time optimal fashion.
