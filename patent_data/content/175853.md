# Rectifier circuit.

## Abstract
A rectifier circuit is disclosed in which the levels of an input signal and a reference signal are compared, and the polarity of the equivalent resistor 31 is set at positive or negative depending on the result of the comparison. The equivalent resistor 31 is connected, as an input resistor, to a differential amplifier 34 . A feedback resistor Rf is con nected between the input and output of the differential amplifier 34 . This arrangement enables the rectifier circuit, with only a single differential amplifier, to perform the rectifying operation with a gain.
