# A self deployable air spoiler assembly.

## Abstract
A self deployable front air spoiler assembly 10 mounted beneath a vehicle underbody 11 the air spoiler assembly 10 comprising a laterally extending airfoil 19 which in non deployed condition is situated in a semi concealed position. The airfoil 19 is supported at each side of the longitudinal center of the vehicle on swingable links 26, 27 each link being pivotally coupled at one end to the airfoil 19 and at the other end to the vehicle underbody. The pivot axes 28, 29, 32, 33 of the links are substantially parallel to the airfoil. Biasing means interposed between the air spoiler assembly 10 and the vehicle underbody 11 normally biases the airfoil 19 toward its deployed condition. As the air pressure against the front face of the airfoil 19 increases as the speed of the vehicle is increased, the airfoil 19 swings downwardly increasing the frontal area impacted by the airstream and restricting the flow of air beneath the vehicle underbody 11 .
