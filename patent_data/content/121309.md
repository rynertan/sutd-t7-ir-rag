# Scan line type dynamic observation apparatus.

## Abstract
A scan line type dynamic observation apparatus suitable for obtaining a static image of specific phase by successively sampling signals of specific phases from image signals of an object of observation which varies at a period particularly several Hz to several KHz. Sampling of signal is performed not in terms of a signal corresponding to a single point on a display image plane but every scanning line forming an image, thereby reducing image forming time. Also, sampling is performed at plural phase positions which repeatedly vary to display a scanning line corresponding thereto at a specific position on the image plane, whereby static images of plural specific phases can be simultaneously displayed on one and the same image plane.
