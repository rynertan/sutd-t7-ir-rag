# Assembly and method for producing endless drive belts.

## Abstract
An assembly and a method for producing an endless transmission belt is disclosed. The assembly comprises an open ended belt 2 of a thermoplastic elastomer and having reinforcing means 4 extending through the entire length thereof. The belt is cut to a required length and its two ends are connected in a permanent joint to form an endless trans mission belt. The joining means is in the form of an elongate splicing member 20 made of a thermoplastic elastomer and having reinforcing means 22 extending through at least a major portion of the length thereof. The splicing member is introducible, in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the belt, into a recessed zone 28 of limited longitudinal extent providable in both end portions of the belt, and is permanently bondable to the belt. The reinforcing means 22 of the splicing member are then sub stantially coplanar with the reinforcing means 4 of the belt.
