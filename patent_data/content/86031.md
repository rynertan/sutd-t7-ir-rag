# Spraying system.

## Abstract
A modular fluid spraying system 201 comprising at least one container 209 for the fluid or fluids to be sprayed, the container 209 being fluid plug connectable to at least one fluid pumping means which is in turn fluid plug connectable to at least one boom section 205 , the said boom section 205 carrying fluid supply connections and being fluid plug connectable to other boom sections 205 and to at least one sprayhead assembly 213 detachably securable to the said boom section 205 or sections 205 and at least one electronic data processing circuit electrically plug connectable to the system and pre set so as to regulate at least one electrically responsive operating parameter of the system 201 when the system is connected to a source of electrical power in use whereby various numbers of containers 209,210 and or various numbers of boom sections 205 may be added or subtracted to the system 201 to achieve a desired combina tion of fluid delivery and spray area.
