# A valve.

## Abstract
The valve 10 comprises a housing 12 having an open ended portion 14 of circular internal cross section, an inlet port and an outlet port, the ports being interconnected by a flow space 16 . An obturator 20 is located within the flow space 16 and attached to a movable head 18 such that fluid flow through the valve 10 may be regulated by the obturator 20 by movement of the head 18 . The head 18 retains a seal 30 which bears upon the inner surface of the portion 14 of the housing 12 so as to resist fluid flow past the head 18 . Preferred features include the provision of biasing means which maintain the seal 30 in a state of compression and a seal 30 which has the form of a hollow open ended cylinder in which the hollow is frusto conical in shape. A bellows 24 con necting the head 18 to the housing 12 and or a seal 28 provided on the head 18 and bearing against an external cover 26 to provide secondary seals against leakage from the flow space 16 . Included is the provision of a leak detector 64 , a readily dismantable valve and a specialised form of obturator 20 .
