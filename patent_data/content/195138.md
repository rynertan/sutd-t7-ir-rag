## Description
HEAT CURABLE CCMPOSITION The present invention is directed to a heat curable canposition comprising a polyepoxide, an unsaturated monomer, an amine, a trialkylsulphonium salt and a free radical curing agent. A large number of curing agents are knawn for epoxy resins but there is still a need to develop curable epoxy resin compositions which cure very rapidly at moderately elevated temperatures yet have very long pot life at roan temperature. It has now been found that certain triallylsuiphonium salts function as exellent accelerators for the amine cure of epoxy resin systems comprising certain unsaturated monomers. These accelerators are much more thermally latent than prior art accelerators such asBF3 oomplexes and give a much longer roam temperature pot life at equivalent 150 QC gel time. The present systems have lower viscosity thus enhancing the processability there of.

Another portion of each mixture was poured into two aluminium moulds containing a linear cavity 12.7 mm square to forrn bar castings. The sheet and bar moulds were placed in an oven and held for two hours at 80 OC and two hours at 150 OC. The sheet and bar castings were then removed from the moulds and tested for mechanical properties. Mechanical properties are given in Table 1. A nutter of salient points can be seen fran Table 1. First, all of the monomers tested gave considerable reductions in system viscosity. RDom temperature tensile strength, modulus and elongation were good in all systems tested. Heat deflection temperature HDT , however, were depressed in comparison with values for the undiluted systems control experiments last two experiments in table . Depression of HDr was greater for nonofunctional diluents than for mixtures of monofunctional and closely related multifunctional diluents. It was also greater for acrylate than for similar methacrylate mixtures.Diluent monomers containing nitrogen N vinylpyrrolidone and N,N dimethylacrylamide raised the gel time of the catalyzed mixtures somewhat in comparison with other monomers.

Samples for testing purposes were prepared as stated in Example 4. A third portion of each mixture was poured into a Ubbelohde viscometer which in turn was placed in a constant tererature bath set at 25 OC, Viscosity was determined periodically for each mixture. Fran the viscosity data was determined for each mixture a pot life , or the amount of time required for the viscosity to double from its initial value. Fran Table I one can see that all three sulphonium salts used Catalyst 1, Catalyst 2, and Catalyst 3 were considerably more latent accelerators than was the control BF3 diethyl etherate experiment 9 . The 25 C pot life of the system accelerated withBF3 diethyl etherate was by far the shortest of any system tested, although this system was in the range of the other accelerated systems in 150 C gel time. In the accelerated systems, progressive replacement of the styrene with divinylbenzene did not change the gel time greatly. All of the diluted systems were depressed in heat distortion temperature HDT in comparison with the undiluted system, with substitution of divinylbenzene for styrene only marginally effective for HDT recovery. Room temperature tensile properties of all of the systems were ccmparable. TABLE IIDivinyl 150 C Time min 25 C 25 CExp.

The gel times of the mixtures were determined on a hot plate at 150 OC, The mixtures were poured into visconneters which were then placed in a 25 C constant temperature water bath. Viscosity of each mixture was determined periodically. Data for each mixture are given inTable III. A number of salient points can be noted fran Table III. First, copper and zinc tetrafluoroborates appeared similar to BF3 diethyl etherate in catalysis of aromatic amine cure of epoxies with regard to 25 C pot life 150 0c gel time relationship. All three materials gave pot lives of 150 210 minutes at gel times of 75 85 seconds. Methyldiphenylsulphonium and ethyldiphenylsulphonium tetrafluoroborates showed an even less favourable combination of gel time and pot life with 25 C pot lives of 120 130 minutes at 150 C gel times of 75 92 seconds. Trietbylsuiphonium tetrafluoroborate showed a very favorable combinAtion of 960 minutes pot life and 107 seconds gel time. However, a strong sulphide odour was emitted during gel plate cure of the system accelerated with triethylsulphonium tetrafluoroborate. When sulphonium salt mixture K , L , or M were used as catalysts, only a very slight sulphide odour could be detected during cure. These latter catalysts also had favourable combinations of gel tie and pot life, with 25 C pot life ranging from 400 to 440 minutes at 150 C gel times of 65 to 95 seconds.
