# Improvements in and relating to electrical inverters.

## Abstract
An inverter which includes a resonant electrical circuit 3, 4 and a charging transistor 12 arranged to charge an energy storage component 3 of the resonant circuit periodically in synchronism with oscillations in the circuit so as to maintain the oscillations. A part of the oscillatory energy of the resonant circuit is transferred to an output circuit so that the inverter supplies output power. The charging transistor 12 forms part of a current limiting switch and is controlled by a control circuit which is arranged to monitor the potential difference across the transistor 12 and to switch it on to charge the resonant circuit 3, 4 at or near zero potential difference. The charging transistor 12 then adds energy to the resonant circuit 3, 4 until the current limit is reached. Charging is then stopped by the switching off of the transistor 12 . The inverter may include an automatic current limit adjustment to compensate for output voltage changes and may include also a start up circuit which operates when the charging transistor has not operated for a set time.
