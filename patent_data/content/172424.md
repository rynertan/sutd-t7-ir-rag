# New type of staggering rod for overhead electric traction contact lines.

## Abstract
Staggering rods for overhead electric traction contact lines, constituted by stainless steel tubes of square cross section. In order to enable their cross sections to assume a different shape while maintaining adequate rigidity, the two ends of the rod are reinforced by inserting into each of them a piece of tube of square cross section having a lesser side, then flattening, or they are firstly flattened and then introduced into pieces of rectangular tube and welded in the inserted section, or alternatively there is disposed at one end a suitable hook having a shank of square cross section which is introduced into the rod and welded in order to make it rigid therewith. Said rods have the advantage of lightness and corrosion resistance compared with those used in the known art.
