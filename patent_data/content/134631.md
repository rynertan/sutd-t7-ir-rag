## Description
This invention relates to peptides, pharmaceutical compositions, processes for producing the peptides, genes coding for the peptides, vectors including the genes and host organisms transformed with the vectors, and gene probes and antibodies for use in diagnosis. The calcitonin gene system has been the subject of considerable research in recent years. In particular, studies on rat calcitonin gene expression have demonstrated the generation, by RNA processing, of alternative mRNA species in an apparently tissue specific manner to produce different peptide hormones from a single gene. Craig R.K. In copending European patent applications EP Al 0070l86 and EP Al 0070675 R.K.Craig and I. MacIntyre there are described the production of human calcitonin and a carboxy terminal peptide designated PDN 21 Katacalcin . Human calcitonin and katacalcin are formed as a polyprotein encoded by the human calcitonin mRNA Craig We have now discovered a region of the human calcitonin gene which is transcribed in human medullary carcinoma cells, and is located distal to the 3 translated region of the human calcitonin mRNA. The region comprises a transcribed intron region, a splice junction, an open reading frame which encodes previously unknown human peptide sequences, and a 3 untranslated region terminating with a tract of poly A residues.

It is common, in the post operative stages of major heart surgery for example in open heart bypass operations , for the patient to react to the stress of the operation by extensive vasoconstriction. This has the effect of Increasing the patient s blood pressure, thus straining the heart. The peptide of the invention has been shown to act as a hypotensive agent and to increase the force of heart beat. These combined effects make it of potential use as a post operative treatment.

The human CGRP sequence contains no Met or Glu residues . The linkage may be a lysine arginine peptide diradical. Cleavage of this linkage may be achieved using a mouse sub maxillary gland protease or, preferably, clostripain EC 3.4.21.6 . The peptide of the first and second aspects of the invention is produced as a polyprotein in the body.

In an eleventh aspect of the invention we provide a peptide of the structure I, or a portion thereof including an antigenic determinant, wherein the peptide or the portion thereof has a detectable label attached thereto. The label may be an enzyme, a chromophore, a fluorophore or a chemiluminescent group.

It is also possible to assay for mRNA coding for PAF 37 or the nucleotide sequence including such mRNA. In an eleventh aspect of the invention therefore we provide a DNA hybridisation probe comprising a sequence of 15 or more nucleotides selected from the nucleotide sequence from 1 to 1256 as shown in Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings. The probe may be immobilised on a solid phase, capable of immobilisation on a solid phase or may be labelled with a detectable label. Such probes may be used to examine gene organisation or gene expression by DNA or RNA blotting techniques or to identify by A preferred probe of the thirteenth aspect of the invention comprises a sequence selected from the nucleotide sequence from 1 to 725 inclusive as shown in Figure 2. A probe of this preferred type may be used to examine human CGRP as opposed to human calcitonin gene organisation or expression. In particular the probe will hybridise to human CGRP mRNA and to the human CGRP structural genes. An alternative preferred probe of the thirteenth aspect of the invention comprises a sequence selected from the nucleotide sequence from 726 to 1256 inclusive as shown in Figure 2. A probe of this preferred type may be used to examine the organisation of the human calcitonin CGRP gene. In particular, the probe will hybridise to an intron region of the human CGRP structural gene. The invention is now illustrated by the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings in which In our copending European published application EP Al 0070675 there is described the construction of a cDNA library using total cellular poly A containing RNA isolated from human medullary thyroid carcinoma tissue see also Allison J Using isolated cDNA fragments from phT B3 and phT B58 we have established by Southern Blotting of restricted human genomic DNA that the cDNA cloned into phT B58 represents a partially processed polyadenylated RNA transcript. In addition to the intron identified by nucleotide sequence analysis, an intron has been mapped to the 3 side of the CGRP coding sequence, and others to the 5 side of the calcitonin coding sequence suggesting a genomic organisation very similar to that of the rat calcitonin gene Rosenfeld, M.G., Mermod, J J., Amara, S.G., Swanson, L.W., Sawchenko, P.E., Rivier, J., Vale, W.W. Evans, R.M. 1983 In order to produce human CGRP by a recombinant DNA technique, vectors capable of producing a fusion protein comprising an active portion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein CAT and a desired intermediate peptide were produced. The vectors are described generally in copending International patent application PCT GB 84 00179 and in British patent application 8413301 filed 24th May 1984 . A plasmid had been isolated by A Plasmid pAT Cm104b was linearised with These sets of DNA molecules were then transformed into Small scale plasmid preparations were performed. A number of plasmids which carried a single Plasmids pAB7, pAB8 and pAB19 were each digested with restriction enzyme These CAT The plasmid vector pCT 203 was cut with Hind III. This gave plasmid DNA having Hind III sticky ends which were then blunted with DNA polymerase. The resultant plasmid DNA was then further cut with Bgl II to yield DNA molecules having a Bgl II sticky end and a blunt end. The resultant DNA was then ligated with the Bgl II Pvu II fragment of plasmid phT B58 see Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 to give circular plasmid molecules. These plasmid molecules were then transformed into Evidence that the fusion protein produced, contains CGRP protein sequence was determined by radioimmunoassay of HB101 pCAT CGRP cell extracts. Cells from a 500 ml culture were harvested and lysed in a lysozyme sodium deoxycholate mixture 5 ml , then treated with DNase for 30 mins. at 5 C Emtage J.S. The tracer was iodinated using the Chloramine T method of Hunter and Greenwood. It can be seen from Figure 5 that HB101 pCAT CGRP protein extract displaced the tracer 5000 cpm using a 1 10000 serum dilution with a displacement curve similar to that of the human CGRP standard chemically synthesised . No displacement was observed using protein extract which had been previously digested overnight with trypsin 0.5 mg ml overnight at 37 C followed by inactivation of the trypsin with trasylol. Goat anti rabbit serum was used to quantitatively precipitate rabbit IgG and bound 125 The construction of the pCAT CGRP plasmid was checked by ScaI digestion this gave a DNA band on a gel that was bigger by the predicted amount, than the corresponding band obtained from pCT203. The plasmid construction was also checked by HaeII digestion. The BglII Pvu II cDNA fragment from phT B58 contains an HaeII site that is not present in pCT203 and the gels showed a cDNA band of the expected size. The fusion protein produced by pCAT CGRP comprises the amino acid sequence of CGRP with additional amino acid residues at the carboxyl terminal and the amino terminal see Figure 1 . The amino terminal includes the sequence Lys Arg immediately preceding CGRP. This provides a site for clostripain cleavage, although case must be taken in view of potential clostripain sites within the CGRP. Other unique cleavage sites may be used. Human CGRP in its amidated form fragments or analogues thereof, and PDA 4 were synthesised by Celltech Limited 244 250 Bath Road, Slough, Berkshire SLl 4D7, United Kingdom or by Peninsula Laboratories Inc., 61 Taylor Way, Belmont, California 94002 U.S.A. The standard techniques of peptide synthesis may be used for example the Merrifield solid phase peptide synthesis or the so called FMOC procedure see Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis A Reassessment by R.C.Sheppard from Molecular Endocrinology eds. MacIntyre and Szelke, Elsevier 1977 P 43 56 E.Atherton Using the amino acid sequence predicted by nucleotide sequence analysis of phT B58, amidated human CGRP has been chemically synthesised and then purified using a combination of ion and reverse phase chromatography. The final human CGRP preparation was pure as judged by mass spectrometry where a single ion was observed Mr 3786 . We have compared the cardiovascular effects of this preparation with a synthetic rat CGRP preparation of similar purity. Groups of 4 to 6 male Sprague Dawley rats 285 315 g were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone 60 mg Kg ¹ i.p. . The trachea, left carotid artery and left jugular vein were cannulated. Blood pressure was recorded from the carotid artery on a Grass polygraph via a Statham P23 ID pressure transducer and mean arterial pressure derived from the trace. Heart rate was measured by a tachograph Grass model 7P4 triggered by the blood pressure signal. Human CGRP was obtained either crude off the resin, then purified, or latterly in a purified form from Peninsula Laboratories. Purified rat CGRP was from the same source. All synthetic preparations were subject to mass spectrometry M Scan Ltd. to confirm structure and purity before use. Human CGRP, rat CGRP, propranolol hydrochloride Sigma , mepyramine maleate Sigma , cimetidine hydrochloride SK F , histamine diphosphate Sigma were dissolved in 0.9 w v saline. All compounds were administered intravenously except for mepyramine s.c. . Saline , human CGRP o and rat CGRP Δ were administered cumulatively in volumes of 0.1 ml per rat at 2 min intervals. The peak fall in mean arterial pressure MAP and heart rate HR after 2 min was measured. Saline administration did not alter MAP or HR, and both human CGRP and rat CGRP evoked a dose dependent fall in MAP and an increase in HR. Propranolol, 3.4 µmol Kg ¹ , 5 min before human CGRP did not prevent the increase in heart rate. Mepyramine 12.4 µmol Kg ¹ and cimetidine 59.5 µmol Kg ¹, as an infusion over 30 min significantly reduced the hypotensive response to histamine 10 ⁸ 10 ⁵ mol Kg ¹ but did not significantly alter the hypotensive effect of human CGRP. Seven injections of saline over the duration of the experiment did not significantly alter either MAP or HR in the presence of propranolol or mepyramine and cimetidine. In the pentobarbitone anaesthetised rat, intravenous human CGRP evoked a rapid dose related fall in blood pressure, maximal within 1 min, and representing a 50 decrease in blood pressure at a dose of 0.28 nmol Kg ¹. This was not significantly different p 0.05 t test from results obtained with rat CGRP 0.23 nmol. Kg ¹ Figure 5. The hypotension was associated with small but significant increases in heart rate. Since a fall in blood pressure may be evoked indirectly by basic peptides through the release of histamine Goth, A. 1973 In Histamine and antihistamines Ed. Schachter, M. Vol. I. Int. Encyclopedia of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Section 74, 25 43 Pergamon Press, Oxford , and human CGRP is a relatively basic peptide, we have examined the effect of pretreatment with the histamine H₁ receptor antagonist mepyramine and the histamine H₂ receptor antagonist cimetidine prior to human CGRP administration. Neither antagonist had a significant effect on the hypotensive response to human CGRP Fig. 6 or the associated tachycardia data not shown . It has also been suggested that rat CGRP may increase heart rate through increased sympathetic drive Fisher, L.A., Kikkawa, D.O., Rivier, J.E., Amara, S.G., Evans, R.M., Rosenfeld, M.G., Vale, W.W. Brown, M.R. 1983 Examination of the cardiovascular action of i.v. PDA 4 in phenobarbitone anaesthetised rats as described above showed a small but significant effect. As can be seen in Figure 7 PDA 4 was 50 100 fold less potent than human CGRP. Thus 1 ug kilo human CGRP resulted in an immediate 50 mmHg drop in mean arterial pressure and an increase in heart beat rate of 25 30 b.p.m. Whilst 10 ug kilo PDA 4 caused a drop in mean arterial pressure of 15 20 mm Hg and an increase in heart beat rate of 15 20 bpm. The mechanism of action of PDA 4 was not examined. The cardiac effects of human CGRP were also studied Male Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs 280 400 g were killed by cervical dislocation and exsanguinated. The heart was removed, the right atrium dissected out and mounted under 0.5 g tension in Krebs solution mM NaCl 118, KCl 4.7, CaCl₂ 2.5, KH₂PO4 1.18, NaHCO₃ 25, MgSO₄ 1.18 and glucose 11.1, at 34 C bubbled with 95 5 O₂ CO₂. Atrial force and rate were measured isometrically by a Grass FT.03 transducer and recorded on a Grass polygraph. Single doses of either human or rat CGRP were given in a random order. Preliminary experiments showed that two consecutive dose response curves to CGRP gave reproduceable results. Propranolol o 300 nM or cimetidine 100 µM , equilibrated for 30 min, antagonised the effects of isoprenaline 3 30 nM or histamine 500 nM respectively in the same experiments where these antagonists did not significantly reduce the increased rate and force evoked by CGRP. The antagonists alone did not significantly alter the basal rate 187 9 b.min ¹ or force 264 34 mg of the isolated atria. In the guinea pig right atrial preparation, human CGRP evoked concentration dependent increases in the rate and force of contraction Fig. 8 . In agreement with results obtained Our studies demonstrate that the peripheral cardiovascular effects of human and rat CGRP in the anaesthetised rat are similar to those reported for peripherally administered rat CGRP in conscious animals, though rat CGRP evoked a greater increase in heart rate in the conscious preparation possibly due to the blunting of cardiovascular reflexes by anaesthesia in our experiments Morrison, J.L. Walker, H.A. Richardson, A.P. 1950 Using the amino acid sequence predicted for human CGRP in Figure 2, we have raised antibodies in rabbits against amidated CGRP, and also the tyrosinated analogue Tyr CGRP amino acids 25 37 amide conjugated to ovalbumin Reichlin, M 1980 , Meth. Enzym. We have also localised human CGRP producing cells by immunocytochemical means at the light level in a paraffin wax embedded human medullary thyroid carcinoma tissue, using immunostaining by the peroxidase antiperoxidase method Sternberger, L.A. 1979 Immunocytochemistry 2nd Edition, J. Wiley Son, N.Y. , demonstrating the diagnostic application of these antibodies in the classification of human tumour pathology. We have also demonstrated the diagnostic value of human CGRP gene probes, to investigate tissue and cell specific calcitonin CGRP gene expression, and also to investigate CGRP gene rearrangement in tumour tissues. Total poly A containing RNA was isolated, from two different medullary thyroid carcinoma tumours and from the DMS 53 and 153 cell lines see Allison Investigation of genomic organisation of the human CGRP gene sequence after restriction endonuclease digestion of normal placental DNA and also MTC tissue DNA and blood lymphocyte DNA from a patient Figure 11 also produced differences in gene organisation. Thus 20 µg of each DNA sample was restricted with BamHI, and the fragments separated on the basis of size by electrophoresis on a 1 w v agarose gel, blotted onto Gene Screen Plus membrane NEN , then probed using a BglII PstI CGRP specific cDNA probe labelled to a specific activity of 10⁸ cpm ug. Hybridisation was performed overnight in 50 v v formamide, 1 w v SDS, 10 w v dextran sulphate in 50 mm Tris HCl pH 7.5. Filters were then washed successively in 2 x SSC at RTP 2 x SSC, 1 w v SDS at 65 C for 30 min., and 0.1 x SSC at 65 C for 15 min then autoradiographed for 48h. This demonstrated Figure 11 a single major band of hybridisation 2.8 kb and a minor band 2.6 kb in all DNA samples, but an additional minor band 3.0 kb in the placental DNA. Thus using a CGRP specific cDNA probe we have identified gene rearrangements, in this instance in a gene which shows homology with the probe, as opposed to being homologous. Such observations point to the diagnostic value of sequence specific probes in the investigation of gene rearrangements in tumour tissue, and in this instance the possibility of using a CGRP gene probe to investigate linked restriction enzyme polymorphisms in the familial form of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Our studies on human calcitonin gene expression at the molecular level, and investigation of the cardiovascular activity of synthetic human CGRP corroborates and extends work by others using the Tat calcitonin gene as a model system Amara, S.G., Jonas, V., Rosenfeld, M.G., Ong, E.S. Evans, R.M. 1982 Our observations that amidated human CGRP peptide PDA 4 have an effect on the cardiovascular system causing an increase in rate and force of contraction of the heart, and a hypotensive effect, suggests a role for the peptides in the clinical management of hypertension. Our studies also demonstrate that the peripheral action of CGRP is independent of catecholamine β receptors and histamine receptors. In the light of the rapid onset of the hypotensive response following the peptide, the present results are consistent with the view that CGRP may act directly on the cardiovascular system through a novel receptor mechanism independent of other mediators.
