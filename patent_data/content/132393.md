# Ticket reading device.

## Abstract
A ticket verification and reading device has a single read ing and writing head 20 . If a card to be read is inserted incor rectly into the entry 11 , rollers 23 and 13 rotate so as to return the ticket, inverting it as it passes round roller 13 . The correctly oriented ticket is then returned to the roller 13 from whence it passes the reading and writing head 20 to be read. Accordingly the device will accept incorrectly inserted cards, automatically re orientating them so that even though the device has only one reading head 20 the cards can be read and, if necessary, verified.
