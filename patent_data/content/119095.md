# APPARATUS FOR AND METHOD OF METALIZING INTERNAL SURFACES OF METAL BODIES SUCH AS TUBES AND PIPES

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for metalizing the interior of pipes or tubes is disclosed. The base metal pipe or tube to be internally metalized is moved axially while simultaneously being rotated at a relatively high rpm. A first pre heat means, preferably an induction heating means, heats a portion of the pipe and its interior to a first elevated temperature, and particles of the metalizing material are deposited into the interior of the pipe to be heated to said first elevated temperature, whereat the particles become at least molten or semi molten and part of a metalizing mass that is at least semi fluidized. The rotation of the pipe distributes the fluidized particles into laminae which, under the further influence of centrifugal forces, automatically distributes the semi fluidized particles effectively, to the end that in the final product the pipe or tube has therein a layer or annulus of metalizing material that strongly adheres to the inner wall of the tube or pipe, that unexpectedly displays great uniformity of character and of innermost surface concentricity, unusual hardness and compactness, and develops an excellent bond between the outermost lamina of metalizing material and the inner wall of the base or substrate. The fluidized metalizing material is bonded together and to the body substrate by application of a second induction heat at a higher heat level or temperature at which bonding occurs between the laminae of metalizing material and between the metalizing material and the base material of the tube or pipe. Preferably the process is performed in the presence of a non oxidizing gas such as pre heated nitrogen. Various means for deliver ing the metalizing powder to the interior of the pipe, at a region between the region of application of the induction heating pre heat and the region of induction heating to a fusing heat, are disclosed. One such means includes a cantilevered delivery tube and spray head from which a shower of metalizing particles is discharged at a controlled rate against the inner wall of the rotating tubular body being metalized. Another such means includes a rotating auger located in a surrounding tube, with rotation of the auger operating to deliver metalizing material at a controlled rate onto the region of the pipe located between the two induction heating means. A treating chamber is provided to shelter the induction heating means and the portion of the body that is being acted upon by said heating means.
