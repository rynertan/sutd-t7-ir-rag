# Process for the production of ethylene and propylene.

## Abstract
A process is described for producing ethylene and prop ylene in high selectivity from feed streams containing ethane and propane. The process involves separating the feed into ethane and propane fractions and subsequently cracking the ethane fraction to produce ethylene and dehydrogenating the propane fraction to produce propylene. The fractions are then combined and purified, and the ethylene and propylene pro ducts are recovered. Any unreacted ethane or propane is recycled back to the cracking or dehydrogenation units respectively.
