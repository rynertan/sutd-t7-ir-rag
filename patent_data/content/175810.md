# Lightweight torquemeter and torque measuring method.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a torquemeter 10 comprising a magnetostrictive element 12 which is formed in the shape of a ribbon upon the surface of the subject rotating member 14 and is capable of producing internal, avalanche Barkhausen reversals, permanent magnets 16 and 18 positioned adjacent to the subject rotating member 14 for successively triggering the avalanche Barkhausen reversals in the magnetostrictive element and for resetting the magnetostrictive element after each reversal, a pickup coil 20 for generating signals responsive to the avalanche Barkhausen reversals and a readout circuit 22 in communi cation with pickup coil 20 for correlating the responsive signal to an indication of the level of torque and or power in the subject rotating member 14 .
