# FREQUENCY SYNTHESISERS

## Abstract
An electronic circuit device, for facilitating channellising in a phase locked loop frequency synthesiser, consists of a plurality of capacitors 7 which may be individually coupled in through appropriate electronic switches 8 , at the input of a quartz oscillator 1 , according to a suitable logic controlled by a microprocessor drived decoder 9 in order to determine an exact shift of the system reference frequency.
