# VERTICAL PRESS

## Abstract
An improved insulated forming press for forming struc tures at elevated temperatures and pressures is disclosed. Vertical rams move vertical heated platens, vertical ram insulation blocks, and vertically oriented forming dies, to close about a workpiece. The workpiece, insulation blocks, platens, and dies are supported by two sets of interlocking support members. One ram is activated by a plurality of mechanical jack screws, and the other is activated by a plurality of hydraulic cylinders that utilize a nonflammable mixture of water glycol. After forming is completed, the tooling can be automatically separated by retracting the rams and the workpiece is removed vertically.
