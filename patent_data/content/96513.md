# Locks.

## Abstract
In a security door lock a pivoted detent 12 deadlocks the bolt 3 by engagement of its stump 22 in pockets 23,24 or 25. The detent 12 is normally held in its locking position by a cam surface 19 on the thrower 11 and by a pack of detainers 7. Rotation of the correct key aligns notches 16 in the detainers 7 with a probe 15 on the detent 12 and also positions a second cam surface 20 of the thrower 11 adjacent to the detent 12, so the detent can pivot to its unlocking position under the action of a spring 13, and thereby free the bolt 3. After the bolt 3 is shifted the final rotation of the key re engages the cam surface 19 against the detent 12 to drive the detent positively back to its locking position. If required, the bolt 3 can be double thrown by a second master key which lifts the detainers 7 to higher positions so that second notches 17 now align with the detent probe 15. This higher lifting of the detainers 7 also lifts a dogging slide 26 so that the stump 30 of the latter can pass over a projection 37 on the bolt tail. The first servant key cannot lift the detainers 7 far enough to lift the slide 26 and hence cannot throw or withdraw the bolt 3 to or from its double thrown position.
