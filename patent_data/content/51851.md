# Sunbeam concentrating and collecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A sunbeam concentrating and collecting apparatus comprising a lens system for concentrating sunbeams and a light conductor cable 5 . In order to obtain the most effective concentrating of the subeams, a beam receiving end face 5a of the light conductor cable 5 must be precisely registered with the focus of the lens system. For this purpose, a cable holding means for holding the beam receiving end face 5a is constructed so as to be able to move and adjust in three directions perpen dicular to one another at one point close to the focus of the lens system, by means of a position adjusting means.
