# Steam reforming hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Hydrocarbon steam reforming process and apparatus wherein blind ended, ie double pass, externally heated reform er tubes 52 are employed. The inner, ie return, tubes 80 are insulated so that there is only a small temperature drop be tween the reacted gas leaving the catalyst zone 90 and enter ing the return tubes 80 and the gas leaving the return tubes 80 . The outer, blind end, tubes 52 preferably have fins 54 and are surrounded by sheaths 56 through which the heating medium passes. The heating medium is preferably hot gas ob tained by subjecting the primary reformed gas to secondary reforming.
