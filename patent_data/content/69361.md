# Method and apparatus for correcting defects on a photomask.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for repairing defect portions of a photomask. A complex material 70 from which a light shading material can be deposited is applied over the photomask 5 . A white blank defect region 7 is irradiated with a continuous wave laser light beam projected in a slit like light image to thereby convert the complex material into the shading material. After washing, a half deposited portion 73 formed in a peripheral portion of the light shading region is further deposited by a post baking process. Those portions of the light shading film which depart from the desired mask pattern are removed together with black solid defect portion 6 originally present in the photomask through irradiation with a pulse laser light beam 47 . The pulse laser is constituted by a Dye laser, while the con tinuous wave laser is constituted by an Ar laser. A specific half mirror 39 which transmits therethrough Ar laser light while reflecting Dye laser light is displaceably provided. The white and the black defects are selectively centered on a same optical axis of an optical projection system including a slit 42 and a condenser lens 43 , whereby the white and the black defect portions are each removed through irradiation with the associated laser light projected thereto in a slit like light image through the same optical projection system.
