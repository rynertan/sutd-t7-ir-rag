## Description
This invention relates to blends of polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers with polyetherimides, and to molding powders, molded articles and films prepared therefrom. USP 4,313,868 teaches injection mouldable copolymers referred to as polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers, or PAI, comprising recurring polyamide units of the structure A which are capable of undergoing imidization and polyamide units of the structure B where the molar ratio of A units to B units is about 80 20 to 20 80 and wherein R is a divalent aromatic hydrocarbon radical of from about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms or two divalent hydrocarbons joined directly or by stable linkages selected from O , CH₂ , CO and SO₂ , and wherein X is a divalent aromatic radical and denotes isomerisation. The publication also states that these copolymers may be filled from about 30 to 60 weight percent with glass fibres, glass beads or mixtures thereof. USP 4,309,528 also describes these copolymers. USP 4,258,155 describes blends of polyetherimides and polyamideimides useful in the coating and moulding arts. These blends exhibit a single Tg which is below the reported Tg s for either of the pure components taken alone. Polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers are extremely rigid polymers which lack the inherent toughness needed to compete in those applications which require elevated temperature resistance and good impact strength. The lack of matrix toughness can cause problems when molding thick cross sectional parts, especially with the filled copolymers, since the copolymer matrix is not strong or tough enough to resist the molding cool down stresses which can result in internal cracks. The art has been looking for improvements in the impact resistance and toughness of the polymer, but it is essential that the additive not impair the excellent curing characteristics of the PAI or its thermal and strength properties, particularly the heat deflection temperature and tensile strength. This invention provides polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers containing polyetherimides and suitable for use as engineering plastics and particularly for use in injection molding. According to the present invention, there is provided a polymeric blend comprising i from 10 to 40 weight percent of a polyetherimide and ii from 90 to 60 weight percent of an amide imide phthalamide copolymer having recurring polyamide A units of which are capable of undergoing imidization, and polyamide B units of wherein the molar ratio of A units to B units is about 1 1, The invention also provides a polymeric blend comprising i from 10 to 40 weight percent of a polyetherimide and ii from 90 to 60 weight percent of an amide imide phthalamide copolymer having recurring polyamide imide A units of and polyamide B units of wherein the molar ratio of A to B units is about 1 1, These blends have excellent physical properties and can readily be injection molded to provide engineering plastics with excellent properties. The polyetherimides improve the physical properties and reduce mold part cracking of neat or filled amide imide phthalamide copolymers and also when glass fibres, glass beads, mineral fillers, graphite fiber or graphite powder are coated with the polyetherimides, these can more readily be incorporated into a molded amide imide phthalamide object. Polyetherimides have also been found to aid the manufacture of amide imide phthalamide films having a thickness of about 0.0127 to about 0.254 mm about 0.5 to about 10 mils . Films without polyetherimides are so brittle that they cannot be prepared from amide imide phthalamide copolymers having a thickness of about 0.5 to about 10 mils without cracking and tearing. Suitable polyetherimides comprise essentially chemically combined units of the formula where R is a member selected from the class consisting of a the following divalent organic radicals and b divalent organic radicals of the general formula where X is C where Q is a member selected from the class consisting of and x is a whole number equal to 1 to 5, inclusive. We have unexpectedly discovered that blends of polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers and polyetherimides disclosed herein over a wide range can be made in which the properties of the blend show a marked average improvement over the properties of the components of these blends, and in some instances, the improvements in properties are unexpected, considering the proportion of either the polyamide imide or the polyetherimide used. By making the above described blends, the utility for both these members in the blend can be considerably expanded. In addition, by blending the polyamide imide with polyetherimides, products can be obtained which are lower in cost than is usually associated with the use of the polyamide imide alone without significant sacrifice, if any, in thermal properties. The polyetherimides which are employed in the present invention can be made in accordance with the disclosures and teachings in U.S. Pat. No. 3,847,867 issued Nov. 12, 1974. The polyamide imides employed in the practice of the instant invention can also be made in accordance with the disclosures and teachings in U.S. Patents 4,313,868 and 4,309,528. The amide imide copolymers comprise recurring polyamide A units of which are capable of undergoing imidization, and polyamide B units of wherein the molar ratio of A units to B units is about 1 to 1 and wherein R is a divalent aromatic hydrocarbon radical of from 6 to 20 carbon atoms or two divalent hydrocarbons joined directly or by stable linkages selected from the group consisting of O , methylene, CO , SO₂ , and wherein X is a divalent aromatic radical and denotes isomerization. In the injection molded form, the polyamide A units have converted to the polyamide imide A units and the copolymer comprises recurring polyamide imide A units of and polyamide B units of wherein the molar ratio of A to B units is about 1 to 1 and wherein R and X are defined as above. The copolymers of this invention are prepared from acyl halide derivatives of dicarboxylic acid such as isophthalic acid or terephthalic acid and an anhydride containing substance and aromatic diamines. Useful acyl halide derivatives of dicarboxylic acid include and related compounds. Suitably, the anhydride containing substance is an acyl halide derivative of the acid anhydride having a single benzene or lower acyl substituted benzene ring. The preferred anhydride is the four acid chloride of trimellitic anhydride 4 TMAC . Useful aromatic diamines include para and meta phenylenediamine, oxybis aniline , thiobis aniline , sulfonylbis aniline , diaminobenzophenone, methylene bis aniline , benzidine, 1,5 diaminonaphthalene, oxybis 2 methylaniline , thiobis 2 methylaniline , and the like. Examples of other useful aromatic primary diamines are set out in U.S. Pat. No. 3,494,890 1970 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,140 1977 . The preferred diamine is meta phenylenediamine. The copolymers of this invention are prepared by reacting a mixture of an acyl halide derivative of an aromatic tricarboxylic acid anhydride and acyl halide derivatives of aromatic dicarboxylic acids with aromatic diamines. A preferred class of polyetherimides which are included by formula III are polymers comprising of from about 2 to 5000 or more units and preferably from about 5 to about 100 units of the formula where R¹ is previously defined, and R² is Included by the polyetherimides of formula III, are polymers comprising the following chemically combined units and mixtures thereof, where R¹ and R² are defined above. The polyetherimides of formulas III VI can be made by effecting reaction between an aromatic bis etheranhydride of the general formula and an organic diamine of the general formula There can be employed from 0.95 to 1.05 mols of aromatic bis etheranhydride per mol of organic diamine. In making the polyetherimides, there are employed from 0.95 to 1.05 mols of the aromatic dianhydride of formula VII per mol of the organic diamine of formula VIII. Preferably, one can employ equal or lower amounts of the bisanhydride and diamine. The aromatic bis etheranhydride of formula VII shown in the above mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 3,847,867, can be prepared from the hydrolysis followed by dehydration of the reaction product of the nitrosubstituted phenyl dinitrile and then continuing the reaction with a dialkali metal salt of a dihydric aryl compound in the presence of a dipolar aprotic solvent, where the alkali metal salt has the general formula The amount of the polyetherimide added to the polyamide imide phthalamide copolymer can be 10 to 40 weight percent. The addition of these polyetherimides increases the physical properties as follows Polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymers build their properties during the annealing step such that molded properties are significantly below the annealed properties as shown in Table 3. To build polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide properties, parts are annealed at temperatures up to about 277 C 530F but preferably about 260 to about 271 C about 500 to about 520 F . It is important that the polyamide imide phthalamide Tg is maintained above the maximum annealing temperature such that optimum properties can be built during annealing. It is also important that the polyamide imide phthalamide Tg is above the maximum annealing temperatures so that part distortion due to stress relaxation does not occur. After cure, a representative 20 percent polyetherimide neat polyamide imide phthalamide copolymer sample had total shrinkage of 1 percent 10 mils per inch while the control had a shrinkage of 0.8 percent 8 mils per inch . It should be particularly emphasized that when our polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers are blended with polyetherimides, an ideal two phase system is formed giving two specific glass transition temperatures, one at about 270 C and the other at about 215 C. Polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimides coated on sized fillers such as glass fibers give better molding characteristics and improved as molded properties. Thus polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymers, containing about 20 to about 60 percent fillers can be marketed without loss of the excellent cured thermal properties of our polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers. Cavity pressure measurements are used as quality control checks of polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide resin viscosity. Pressure buildup during the filling of an injection molded part is measured at a point in the cavity ejector pin . This is accomplished by placing a pressure transducer behind the ejector pin and recording the pressure with a chart recorder or other readout device. Cavity pressure normally rises as the mold is being filled and peaks as the molten resin is packed into the cavity. As the resin solidifies, cavity pressure decreases. We have found that resins that have low cavity pressure process poorly and that spiral flow measurements were not sensitive enough to discriminate between resins in the viscosity range of interest. Low cavity pressures indicate a large pressure drop between injection and cavity pressures. This indicates higher resin viscosities. In the same manner high cavity pressures indicate less pressure change between injection and cavity pressures, suggesting lower resin viscosities. Amide imide polymer and copolymer viscosities had been measured by spiral flop determination previous to the implementation of the cavity pressure procedure, see U.S. Patent 4,224,214. Cavity pressure was selected over spiral flow because of its greater sensitivity. The cavity pressure test has been implemented as an amide imide homopolymer and copolymer quality control procedure. Like spiral flow, cavity pressure is a test that can be done conveniently in a molder s shop. The injection molding machine was equipped with a horizontally mounted thermoset screw and barrel assembly. The mold was heated with hot oil from a Mokon Model 105 057 heating unit. Cavity pressure was recorded with a Control Process Model 241 recorded. The mold was equipped to handle pressure transducers at the ejector pins located at the gate end of the tensile bar and the gate end of the flex bar before beginning the work. Since it was desirable to make cavity pressure measurements at the dead end of the flex bar, it was necessary to make some modifications in the mold base to accommodate a transducer at this pin position. Resins were dried in a desiccant hot air circulating oven at 149 C 300 F for at least 16 hours before testing. Moisture in polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide system has a very significant effect on the copolymers and their flow properties. Therefore, special care was taken to be sure the samples were properly dried. This drying procedure was used before making flow rate and cavity pressure measurements. The flow rate procedure was patterned after the standard method described in ASTM D1238. A 335 C 635 F barrel temperature with a 30 minute preheat time was used. This is about the largest set of weights that can be used safely with the standard extrusion plastometer apparatus. A standard 2.096 mm 0.0825 in. diameter, and a 8.00 mm 0.315 in . long orifice was used. Special care was taken to be sure that each flow rate measurement was started when an equivalent volume of resin was in the barrel. Previous rheology work indicated that there is a very large barrel height effect on amide imide copolymers. Each flow rate measurement was initiated while the top of the piston collar was between the two scribe marks on the piston. This precaution is also required by ASTM in method D1238. Films having a thickness of about 0.0127 0.254mm 0.5 to 10 mils have been produced from our polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide resins. These films have properties as shown in Example 15. The reinforced polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymers may be prepared in various ways. For example, so called roving endless glass fiber strands are coated with the polyetherimide, disclosed herein, and then are further coated with the polyamic acid melt and subsequently chopped. The chopped fibers or the glass beads coated with polyetherimides may also be mixed with granulated polyamic acid and the resulting mixture melted in a conventional extruder, or alternatively the fibers coated with polyetherimides may be directly introduced into the polyamic acid melt through a suitable inlet in the extruder. Injection molding of the unfilled or glass filled polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymers is accomplished by injecting the copolymers into a mold maintained at a temperature of about 177 C 350 F to about 232 C 450 F . In this process, a 15 to 30 second cycle is used with a barrel temperature of about 304 C 580 F to about 354 C 670 F . The injection molding conditions are given in Table IV. The mechanical properties of the unfilled amide imide copolymers containing polyetherimides melt compounded and also the filled polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymers are given in Table V and it shows that these copolymers have improved cured mechanical properties and excellent thermal properties despite the fact that they contain about 10 to about 40 weight percent of polyetherimide. All of the materials studied were molded on the 10 oz. Stokes injection molder under Table IV molding conditions unless specified otherwise. A 10 oz. Stokes injection molder is fitted with a 1 1 compression thermoset screw which can hold approximately 365 grams of the polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymer approximately 0.8 lbs . Since each test tree weighs approximately 23 grams neat parts only 1 16th of the complete injection stroke shot volume is used during the molding evaluation. Under these conditions 18 second clamp , the total time the copolymer is trapped in the barrel is approximately 7.2 minutes total cycle is 27 seconds . This does not mean that the copolymer is in the melt state for the complete 7.2 minutes due to the temperature gradient front to rear in the barrel. For a complete material transition purge 16 20 shots must be taken before collecting data. Polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymer flow, under molding conditions, is determined by its cavity pressure which is measured at a point farthest from the sprue. In this test, a pressure transducer is fitted behind a knockout point located behind the flex bar. The higher the cavity pressure, the better the flow thus making for easier mold filling. To determine our polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymer reactivity a plot of cavity pressure vs. cycle time is drawn. A stable or non reactive resin will exhibit good flow characteristics under adverse molding conditions resulting in a melt insensitive to a change in cycle time. A reactive copolymer will be cycle time dependent in that its viscosity increases with cycle time. This is illustrated by a steep negative cavity pressure slope. Polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymer samples were all dried for approximately 16 hours at about 300 F in a hot air circulating oven containing a suitable desiccant. Polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimides were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 110 C 230 F . Samples were dry blended together and stored under vacuum in sealed containers. Polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymer samples were cured in a Blue M hot air programmable oven under a 7 day cycle with 1 day at 160 C 320 F , 204 C 400 F , 232 C 450 F , 246 C 475 F and 3 days at 260 C 500 F . Several tensile bars were cured under a 7 day cycle with 3 days at 268 C 515 F . The following examples illustrate the preferred embodiment of the invention. It will be understood that the examples are for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to be wholly definitive with respect to conditions or scope of the invention. A 3.8 l 10 gal , glass lined Pfaudler kettle equipped with a water cooled jacket and nitrogen inlet was charged with 4.48 kg 9.87 lbs of m phenylenediamine, 0.159 kg 0.35 lbs of trimellitic anhydride and 26.9 kg 59.2 lbs of N methylpyrrolidone. After solution had occurred under a nitrogen purge, an intimate blend of 4.32 kg 9.52 lbs of 4 trimellitoyl anhydride chloride and 4.16 kg 9.17 lbs of isophthaloyl dichloride was added over 2.5 hrs keeping the temperature below 35 C. The resulting viscous solution was brought to 50 C. When the Gardner viscosity had reached a Z3 viscosity the solution was precipitated by passage through a Fitzpatrick comminuting mill. The polymer product was washed five times with deionized water followed by air drying on a filter for 3 days. The product was then brought to a solids content of 98.3 per cent by heating in a forced air oven for 2 hrs at 470 Metaphenylenediamine 540 g and acetic acid 900 ml were placed in a five liter, three necked, round bottom flask, equipped with mechanical stirrer, pressure equalizing addition funnel and nitrogen sparge tube, and distillation head and condenser. The nitrogen sparge was set at 300 cc min and 765 g of acetic anhydride were added over 5 min. This was followed by the addition of 415 g of isophthalic acid and 480 g of trimellitic anhydride. The temperature of the bottom half of the spherical heating mantle surrounding the flask was set at 371 C 700 F and the top half of the mantle was heated with a Variac set at 50. After 105 min, 1730 ml of distillate were collected and the polymer had become very viscous. The heat was turned off and the polymer was cooled under nitrogen. A solution consisting of 533.3 grams of NMP, 300 grams of DMAC, and 58.0 grams of propylene oxide was stirred and cooled to 8 A 3.8 l 10 gal glass lined Pfaudler kettle equipped with a water cooled jacket and nitrogen inlet was charged with 4.48 kg 9.87 lbs of m phenylenediamine, 0.159 kg 0.35 lbs of trimellitic anhydride and 26.9 kg 59.2 lbs of N methylpyrrolidone. After solution had occurred under nitrogen purge, an intimate blend of 4.32kg 9.52 lbs of 4 trimellitoyl anhydride chloride and 4.16kg 9.17 lbs of isophthaloyl dichloride was added over 2.5 hrs keeping the temperature below 35 C. The resulting viscous solution was brought to 50 A round bottom, 2000 ml, 4 necked flask was charged with 1045 g dry N methylpyrrolidone NMP , 16.2 g 1.5 mol m phenylenediamine MPDA , and 4.3 g trimellitic anhydride TMA 0.0225 mol . The flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet tube, themometer, and a liquid addition funnel. During solution of the diamine and TMA, the additional funnel was charged with 248.0 g 1.178 mol 4 trimellitoyl anhydride chloride 4 TMAC and 60.9 g 0.30 mol isophthaloyl dichloride IPCl₂ and melted at 80 A polyamide imide phthalamide copolymer was, dry blended with various amounts of a polyetherimide and then the blend was melt homogenized in a Brabender mixing head for 6 minutes at a mixing speed of 47 rpm. The stock temperature was set at 340 Glass transition temperatures and ΔCp s were determined on the Omnitherm QC25 thermal analyzer. The calibration of the instrument was checked periodically over the time span that the samples were run. Five such calibration checks yielded an estimated precision of 1 C in Tg s and 3 in the ΔCp s. In this and the following Examples the polyamide imide phthalimide copolymer used was that described in Example IV. The polyetherimide used was Ultem 1000, man. General Electric Company. The above results indicate that the polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers are not miscible with the polyetherimide since two distinct glass transition Tg temperatures were observed, one Tg for each component. Solution blends of the polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers with polyetherimide were prepared in N methyl 2 pyrrolidone at ca. 80 100 C. The samples were then precipitated out, using H₂O, washed, filtered and dried at 150 C for several days under vacuum. Similar results were obtained where a two phase, non miscible blend was observed more than one blend Tg . These solution and melt blends of a polyamide imide phthalamide copolymer and polyetherimide form an ideal two phase system while those reported in U.S. Patent 4,258,155 where a single phase system was observed do not. Neat polyamide imide phthalamide copolymer polyetherimide blends can be prepared by physically blending the constituents together, either pellet to pellet, powder to powder, powder to pellet, or pellet to powder with or without a compounding step prior to injection molding or film extruding. It is preferred that the constituents are melt compounded, especially via a twin screw extruder. The filled polyamide imide phthalamide copolymer polyetherimide blends can be prepared as described above or the polyetherimide can be dissolved in a solvent and spray coated or dip coated on the filler and or reinforcement graphite fibers, glass fibers, and mineral fillers . When polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers are fiber filled and then injection molded into parts that have cross sections greater than 6.35 mm 250 mils , internal part cracking becomes a problem. It is believed that the low as molded prior to curing strength and toughness of the polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers cannot resist the cool down stresses during molding resulting in parts which have internal cracks. Thus the parts are not commercially useable. We have found that by alloying blending up to 40 by polymer weight of polyetherimide with the polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers as molded strength and toughness properties are substantially improved and that thicker wall parts can be molded crack free. The preferred blending ratio is 80 20 polyamide imide phthalamide copolymer polyetherimide. These alloys can be cured to temperatures up to 260 C 500 F and during the curing step the alloy increases its mechanical and thermal properties. With successful alloys, the property profile is either additive or synergistic, whereas with incompatible undesirable blend systems, the observed properties are lower than either polymer component. An ideal alloy would be one whose property profile is synergistic where the alloy exhibits properties superior to either polymer component. The polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymer blends are ideal two phase systems since they exhibit a synergistic strength profile trend where the tensile strengths of the alloy are greater than either of its polymer blend components. For example, the tensile strength of polyetherimide and polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers are less than 117.3MPa 17,000 psi while the 90 10, 80 20, 70 30 and 60 40 blends of the polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide have tensile strengths of 164.2, 157.3, 149.0 and 136.6 MPa 23,800, 22,800, 21,600 and 19,800 psi respectively. This synergistic property profile trend is novel to the polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide blends and different from other polyamide imides that are blended with polyetherimide. These other polyamide imide polyetherimide blends have tensile strengths which lie between the polyamide imide and the polyetherimide and can be estimated by the laws of mixtures. This difference in property response between the polyamide imides alloyed with polyetherimide illustrates that not all amide imides behave the same when blended with the same secondary polymer components. Neat polyamide imide phthalamide copolymer parts are extremely brittle and tend to crack or shatter during the ejection sequence of an injection molding run. This problem of cracking and shattering is reduced when the neat polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers are alloyed with polyetherimide. These alloys have improved strength and toughness allowing the alloy to withstand the ejection force of the knockout pins. The neat polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers have good flow properties at temperatures at and above 343 C 650 F and at ejection molding shear conditions. These polyamide imide phthalamide copolymers are thus alloyed to build properties and to improve the crack resistance of the copolymer. Polyamide imide phthalamide polyetherimide copolymer films can be fabricated on a single or twin screw extruder that have thickness in the 0.013 0.25mm 0.5 10 mil range. These copolymer alloys can also be extruded into thicker extrudates such as ribbons and sheets. An 80 20 polyamide imide phthalamide copolymer polyetherimide blend film was extruded on a Werner Pfleider ZSK 30 twin screw extruder and films from 0.025 0.25mm 1.0 10 mils were collected. This polyamide imide phthalamide alloy has good melt ductility characteristics allowing the hot melt to be drawn into a thin film. To illustrate the drawability of the alloy, samples were collected at take off speeds as high as 21.3m min 70 ft min machine limit resulting in a highly oriented 0.038 mm 1.5 mil film. The uncured films were resilient and could be creased in the transverse direction without tearing or shattering. The films were also translucent and cherry red in color and did not delaminate. Each of the films was cured at 208 C 515 F without stress relaxing and micro tensile tiers were die cut without any difficulty.
