# Process for ion exchange between fine particle size ion exchange resins and macrobead ion exchange resins.

## Abstract
Ion exchange can be carried out between ion exchange resins having a particle size of 0.01 to 1.5 micrometers and macrobead ion exchange resins having a particle size of at least 40 micrometers in batch and continuous processes. This can be used to place the fine resins in a desired ionic form either during their preparation or to regenerate them after use. Individual or mixed fine resins and individual or mixed macrobead resins can be used in this way.
