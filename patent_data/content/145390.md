# HIGHLY PURIFIED PROTEIN, PRODUCTION AND USE THEREOF

## Abstract
A substantially pure non glycosylated human inter leukin 2 protein having a specific activity of not less than 10‚Å¥ U mg is obtained by growing a transformant carrying a DNA having a base sequence coding for human interleukin 2 to cause production and accumulation of human interleukin 2 in the culture broth, and subjecting the thus obtained human interleukin 2 containing liquid to a purification process com prising a hydropholic column chromatography.
