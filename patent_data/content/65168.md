# Process for the purification of epsilon caprolactam.

## Abstract
Process for the purification of e caprolactam, obtained through rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime by means of sulphuric acid or oleum, by subjecting the caprolactam to be purified to distillation under reduced pressure, with separation of low boiling and high boiling impurities. The destillation is carried out in two steps with at least in the 1st step an evaporator with a rectification column containing packing material with a pressure drop of less than 2.5 mbar per theoretical tray. The caprolactam to be purified is supplied to the rectification column of the lst step, the low boiling impurities are carried off from this column, the bottom product remaining in the lst step is supplied to the 2nd step and in this step the high boiling impurities are carried off as bottom product. The purified caprolactam is recovered as top product.
