# A DOOR FOR A COMBINATION GAS OR ELECTRIC AND MICROWAVE OVEN

## Abstract
Described is a door for a gas or electric and microwave oven, comprising an outer peripheral frame having a first glass window secured thereto, an inner door provided with a second glass window, and a perforate metal screen interposed be tween the two windows. According to the invention, the inner door is detachably secured to the outer door frame and formed of first and second frame members arranged so as to form first and second microwave traps each having a length equal to about one quarter of the wavelength of the radiation employed and being oriented in mutually perpendicular directions. The invention permits a conventional door for a gas or electric oven to be readily modified for use with a combined gas electric and microwave oven so as to guard against the escape therefrom of microwave energy.
