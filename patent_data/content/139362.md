# Masking tape applicator.

## Abstract
A hand held tape dispenser and applicator 10 having a lightweight material plastics housing 12, 13 with a hollow hub 18 at one end mounting an exposed roll of pressure sensitive adhesive tape R and a hand grasped hollow finger 11 extending from the gub 18 to a dispensing outlet where a feed roll 53 receives the adhesive side of the tape and directs the opposite side of the tape to a press roll 62 for applying the tape to a surface. A thumb operatable slidable trigger 60 on the top of the finger selectively rocks a cutter head 60c over the press roll 62 to sever the dispensed tape. The housing is longitudinally split with the two mating components 12, 13 snap fitted together and easily pulled apart to insert the tape roll R and thread the tape over the feed roll. A belt clip 70 receives the hollow hub permitting the applicator to be releasably suspended from the waist belt of a user.
