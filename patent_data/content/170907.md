# Monolithic delta frame circuit.

## Abstract
A monolithic delta frame circuit comprises a high speed line address circuit 110 , demultiplexer 112 , line shift regis ter 114 , plurality of buffer amplifier 116 , array of difference frame elements 118 , reset circuit means 132 , plurality of sample and hold means 138 , multiplexer 139 and high speed line address circuit 140 . The high speed line address 110 clocks the single line video input at a fast rate into the de multiplexer 112 for demultiplexing into the line shift register 114 , the line shift register shifts the single line signals and noise into the elements of the array of difference frame ele ments 118 . As the data from the previous frame which con sists of noise or noise minus signals is still present in the differ ence elements only the signal of delta signal protion feeds through reset circuit means 132 at a slower rate to the multi plexer 139 . The rest circuit means 132 introduces offset noises into the signal which are substantially reduced by feed back through the reset circuit means. The high speed line ad dress register 110 is connected to the multiplexer 139 for controlling the video output signals through the video out ter minal. The video output is at the fast rate, to reduce this rate for minimizing display blind time the sample and hold circuits 138 are introduced between the reset circuit means 132 and mul tiplexer 139 . Thus the monolithic delta frame may be used to remove reset noise and rate conversion or in tandem to re move reset noise and offset noise as well as rate conversion.
