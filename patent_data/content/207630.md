## Abstract
An electrode assembly for effecting electrochemical reac tion between two fluid phases, the first of which is liquid, which apparatus is characterized by an electrode permeable to the fluids, means for containing the first fluid phase in contact with the electrode, means for charging the second fluid phase to the elec trode means for removing a reaction product of the two phases from the electrode, and means for rotating the electrode about an axis, such that when the second fluid phase is charged to the electrically charged, rotating electrode permeated with the first fluid phase, the second fluid phase permeates the electrode from the point of charging and the reaction product is removed from the electrode a series cell cascade comprising at least two such electrode assemblies in series and a process for effecting electrochemical reaction, using such an electrode assembly.
