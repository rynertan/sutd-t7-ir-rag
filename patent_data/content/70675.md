## Description
QUIIAN CALCITO IF PRECURSOR POLYPROTEIN STRUCTURAL C,E E This invention relates to the field of recombinant DNA biotechnology. In particular it relates to the use of recombinant DNA biotechnology in the production of human calcitonin precrsor structural genc, gene, the insertion of said geoc in a vector system, the cloning thereof and subsequently the production of human calcitonin. Calcitonin is a small polypeptide hormone consisting of 32 amino acid residues 3500 mol.wt synthesized and secreted in humans by the C cells of the thyroid gland. The main physiological function of calcitonin is to limit skeletal breakdown during times of calcium and phosphorus requirement, for example during growth, pregnancy and lactation. Thus for instance the absence of calcitonin during rapid growth in adolescence causes bone loss. A similar loss of bone may occur in pregnancy, when calcitonin secretion is absent. Calcitonin levels in men are higher than in women, and in both sexes, levels decline with age.This is particularly apparent in women after the menopause, where low levels of calcitonin appear to be an important factor in post menopausal bone loss and osteoporosis. It is prohable that should human calcitonin become commercially available in sufficient quantity, the peptide will be used alone or in combination with other drugs in the prevention and treatment of post menopausal ostcoporosis. Calcitonin may also be helpful in the treatment of elevated plasma calcium due to malignant deposits in bone. The commonest cause of this is cancer in the breast with secondary deposits in the skeleton. The action here probably reflects in part inhibitory action of calcitonin in osteoclas ts.The latter are partly responsible for increased bone destruction leading in turn to elevated plasma calcium levels. Cal ci toni n may also have a direct action on cancer cells in bone and thus may play a role in the action of calcitonin in lowering elevated plasma calcium levels due to malignant deposits in bone. At present, calcitonin purified from salmon is used in pharmacological rather than replacement doses, for the treatment of Paget s disease. This is a common condition affecting, in the main, people over 40 years of age. In this group as many as 4 ú of the population may be affected. Thus in the U.., for instance, although the disease is usually asymptomatic, there are tens of thousands of people needing treatment. Unfortunately prolonged treatment with salmon calcitonin has prove,d impracticable due to immuno in about 5 of cases logical rejection of the fish calcitonin variant . Consequently there is already a need for large amounts of human calcitonin We have elucidated the fine structure of a human calcitonin structural gene, which may be inserted into a prokaryote or eukaryote cell system by known recombinant DNA techniques, such that human calcitonin, in addition to other peptides encoded within the structural gene, may be synthesised in large quantities, purified, and subsequently used for pharmacological purposes. Total human poly A containing mRNA isolated from a medullary carcinoma of the thyroid directs the synthesis in cell free protein synthesizing systems of a major poly peptide of estimated mol.wt. 21000. This, and a series of minor polypeptides of lesser abundance are precipitable with antiserum raised against synthetic human calcitonin.The experiments conducted to show this are described shown in figure 1 hereinafter and the results contrast markedly with the known mol.wt. of calcitonin circulating in normal human serum 3500 . Analysis of the mRNA species which direct the synthesis of these high molecular weight presumptive calcitonin precursors, was carried out by a combination of recombinantDNA technology, DNA sequence analysis, and size determination of the calcitonin mRNA. Thus total poly A ccntaininy RNA known to direct the synthesis of high molecular weight immunoprecipitable forms of human calcitonin, was used as a template to synthesize a double stranded eDNA population.This was inserted into plasmid DNA using established procedures and transformed into a suitable E.coli host. Colonies containing cDN ,S sequences representative of the most abundant thyroid poly A containing RNA populations were selected using in situ hybridisatian y b r I di 5 a tic n procedures, and those containing calcitonin cDA sequence then identified by hybridisation translation. We also describe here the detailed analysis of two of these plasmids designated phT 3 and phT 56, and their subsequent use to determine the size, sequence and coding potential of those mRNA s encoded by the calcitonin structural gene s . The results depicted in Figure 2 demonstrate A That the recombinant plasmids contain additional DNA sequence phT B6, 490 bps phT B3, 590 bps when compared with the parental plasmid DNA, as determined by restriction analysis using the endonuclease Pst I. B That both recombinant plasmids contain sequences capable of hybridising a thyroid mRNA species which directs the synthesis of the presumptive human calcitonin precursor polyprotein in a cell free protein synthesizing system. C That both recombinant plasmids contain cDNA sequence in common as judged by restriction endonuclease mapping, but that phT B3 contains additional sequence at one end of a common fragment, and phT B6 additional sequence at the other. Figure 3 shows the results of an RNA blotting experiment using a 32P labelled phT B3 hybridisation probe. From this it is apparent that the mRNA species in question are present in large amounts in thyroid tissue and are 1000100 nucleotides in length.That data described above defines the source of calcitonin mRNA, the size of the mRNA and demonstrates that calcitonin is synthesized as a high molecular weight precursor polyprotein which in vivo must require extensive post translational processing prior to secretion. DNA sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA sequences i defines the relative position of the caleitonin peptide within this precursor polyprotein. ii reveals the amino acid sequence of the flanking NH2 terminal and CO0H terminal peptides. Figure 4 depicts the nucleotide sequence of cDA inserted into plasmids phT 83 and phT BG and Figure 5 depicts the DNA se quencing strategy employed to determine this sequence. One phT 36 contains the whole of the 3 untranslated region of the mRNA, part of the sequence encoding the calcitonin peptide, and reveals that the mRNA encodes 2 further 25 amino acids after the COOH terminal proline of calcitonin before a stop codon is encountered in phase.The other phT B3 contains a sequence which specifies the whole of the calcitonin peptide, the additional 25 amino acids of the flanking COOH terminal cryptic peptide, a 36 amino acid NH2 terminal cryptic flanking peptide, and most of the 3 untranslated region of the mRNA. In all we have sequenced 5E0 bases or 60 of the total human calcitonin mRNA using two overlapping cDNA clones. The human calcitonin structural gene s encode mRNA species of 1000 100 bases in length. Translation of these mRNAs gives rise to a 21,000 mol.wt. precursor polyprotein. The calcitonin pep tide resides towards the COOH terminus of this polyprotein, flanked on the COOH terminal side by an additional 25 amino acids, and on the NH2 terminal side by an amino acid sequence of as yet undetermined length though. greater than 36 amino acids in length. Thus, in one aspect the present invention comprises human calcitonin precursor polyprotein structural gene. The invention also comprises a DNA transfer vector, especially a plasmid, having an inserted polypeptide fragment including the following amino acid sequence cys gly asn leu ser thr cys met leu gly thr tyr thr gin asp phe asn lys phe his thr phe pro gln thr ala ile g ly val gly ala pro. The invention also includes DNA transfer vector, especially a plasmid, having an inserted polypeptide fragment which includes the following amino acid sequence val leu leu ala ala leu val gln asp tyr val gln met lys ala ser glu leu glu gln glu gln glu arg glu sly ser ser leu asp ser pro arg ser lys arg cys gly asn leu ser thr cys met leu gly thr tyr thr gln asp phe asn lys pile his thr phe pro gln thr ala ile gly val gly ala pro gly lys lys arg asp met ser ser asp leu glu arg asp his arg pro his val ser met pro gln asn ala asn . Further according to the invention a method of forming a DNA transfer vector having a nucleotide sequence coding for a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of human calcitonin comprises i providing mRNA coding for a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of human calcitonin, ii synthesizing a double stranded cDNA one strand of which has a nucleotide sequence complementary to that of the mRNA5 and iii inserting said double stranded cDNA in a DNA transfer vector. The mRNA is suitably provided by cells containing the mRNA originating from the thyroid gland of a calcitonin producing organism. Other sources of such cells include the lung and rain. The DNA transfer vector is suitably transferred to and replicated in a microorganism strain, e.g. a bacterium such as Escherichia coli. The invention also provides a polypeptide containing the amino acid sequence of human calcitonin which is processable, suitably by cleaving, to produce human calcitonin. Such polypeptide is suitably a fusion protein comprising a host protein in combination with a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence of human calcitonin. The invention still further provides a method for the production of human calcitonin comprising processing a polypeptide to produce human calcitonin in which said polypeptide has been expressed by a host organism which has been transformed with a gene containing DNA transfer vector comprising an inserted gene encoding a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of human calcitonin. There follows a description of experimental work undertaken to construct and characterise plasmids containing complementary DNA sequences to human calcitonin precursor polypro tein, and the subsequent production of human calcitonin from trp E calcitonin fusion proteins.I.

Craig, R.K. 1981 Biochem.J.196, 567 574 .b. Isolation of poly A containinq RNA from human medullary carcinoma of the thyroid the construc tion, transformation and selection of recombinant plasmids. Total RNA was isolated from frozen human thyroid medullary carcinoma tissue as described by Hall,L.Craig, 9.. Campbell, P.N. 1979 Nature London 277,54 56 , and residualDNA removed by digestion With deoxyribonuclease 2s described by Zimmerman, S.B. and Sandeen 0. 1966 Anal.Riochem.14, 269 277. Poly A containing RNA was then isolated by affinity chromatography on oligo dT cellulose, and a size selected double stranded cDNA population was then synthesized from the resulting poly A containing RNA population as described previously Craig et al., 1981 Hall,L.Davies, M.S. Craig, R.K. 1981 Nucleic Acids Res.9, 65 84 . The size selected double stranded cDNA was then extended at the 3 hydroxyl termini with d residues in the following manner. Double stranded cDNA 1 g ml was dissolved in 30mM Tris 100me cacodylic acid adjusted to pH7.5 with 10 4 l OH containing 2mM CoCl2, 0.1mM dithiothreitol, 50 g of nuclease free bovine serum albumin ml, and 0.1mM H dCTP 4Ci mmol . Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 300units ml was then added and the mixture incubated at 30oC.When a 30 50 residue long poly dC tail had been added approx. 1Smin as determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of 16ul amounts at 5min intervals , the was reaction terminated by extraction with phenol chloroform, and the nucleic acid was recovered by ethanol precipitationThe precipitate was washed twice with ethanol, dissolved in double distilled water and stored at 700C. Highly purified supercoiled pAT153 DNA prepared as described previously Craig et al., 1981 was digested with the restriction endonuclease PstI, then tailed with poly dG 12 essentially as described above, except that the DNA was present at 50,y ml. t HldGTP 1.7Ci mmol replaced dCTP as the radiolabelled deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was present at a final concentration of 800units ml. Poly dC tailed cDNA and poly dG tailed pAT153 DNA were then annealed in 10m Tris XHCl, pH7.6, containing 200m NaCl and 1mM EDTA, in polypropylene 0.4ml snap cap tubes at a final concentration of 0.4 g ml and 4 2 ml respectively.The mixture was heated in a water bath to 70ar for 30min, the water bath switched off, and the hybridization mixture allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. The amount of poly dO5 tailed cDNA used for transformation varied from 10 to 20 ng. The resulting chimaeric Dlasmid DNA was then used to transform Eacherichia coli hub101 Hub101 rec A foyer, H. Roulland Dussoix, D. 1969 J.tiol.Biol. 41, 459 472 , under conditions of good microbiological practice in accordance with the guidlines laid down by the British GeneticManipulation Advisory Group, using methodology described elsewhere Craig et al., 1981 . Transformed cells were selected on 1.5Z w v agar in L broth containing 12.5my of tetracycline ml. Individual colonies were then replica plated onto fresh agar plates containing 12.5 9 of tetracycline ml alone or 100f8 of ampicillin ml alone.Those colonies found to be sensitive to ampicillin were selected for subsequent experimentation.c. Identification of plasmids containing human calcitonin precursor polyprotein cDNA sequnces, and characterization of calcitonin precursor polyprotein mRNA. Colony filter hybridization in situ, plasmid growth and purification, positive hybridization translation, purification of individual cDNA sequences, and size estimation of individual mR.t9A sequences using the Northern transfer technique have been described elsewhere seeCraig et al., 1981 Burditt, L.J.Parker, D.Craig, R.k.

Unless specifically stated otherwise all restriction enzyme analyses were performed using the ionic conditions recommended by the manufacturers. Size analysis of restricted plasmid DNA was performed by electrophoresis on flat bed agarose gels as described elsewhere Craig at al., 1981 .d. Cell free protein synthesis and product analvsis. mRNA directed cell free protein synthesis in the wheat germ cell free protein synthesizing system and antibody precipitation procedures were as described byCraig et al., 1976 . SDS polyacrylamide gel electro phoretic analysis was performed using slab gels as described by Pascall et al. 19R1 . Fluorography followed the procedure of Bonner, W. Laskey, R.A. 1974 Eur.J.Biochem. 46, 83 88 except that dimethylsuiphoxide was replaced by glacial acetic acid Burckhardt, J.Telford, J. Birnstiel, M.L. 1979 Nucleic Acids Res. 6, 2963 2971 . II. Results e. Isolation and characterization of a ooly A containing RNA population from human medullary thyroid carcinoma tissue. Total human poly A containing RNA isolated from a medullary carcinoma of the thyroid was added to a wheat germ cell free protein synthesizing system, and the resulting 35Smethionine labelled proteins were analysed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The results Fig.1a demonstrate that a spectrum of proteins up to mol.wt.60000 was synthesized. The most prominent of these, a protein of estimated mol.wt.21000, proved to be precipitable with antiserum raised against human calcitonin. In addition to this protein, three less abundant peptides of estimated mol.wt.19500, 18000 and 15000 were also precipitated by calcitonin specific antiserum.It is believed that these may represent partially processed calcitonin precursor polyproteins, a result of post translational processing activities present in the wheat germ cell free extract seePascall et al. 1981 . Alternatively these may result from the translation of multiple poly A containing species encoding different polyproteins each containing the calcitonin amino acid sequence. These differences were particularly apparent at Flg2 concentrations which were suboptimal for protein synthesis. Thus at 1.5m g3 the predominant polypeptide was the mol.wt. 18000 calcitonin precursor polyprotein form whilst at 2.5mtA Mg , the optimum for protein synthesis, the mol.wt. 21000 calcitonin precursor polyprotein form predominant see Fig.1b .Immaterial of the t192 concentration, the predominant polypeptides remained precipitabie with antiserum raised against human calcitonin Fiq.1c . Overall, on the basis of the sources of tissue and the identification of polypeptide immunoprecipitable with human calcitonin antisera as the predominant products of mRNA directed cell free protein synthesis, we conclude that an abundant poly A containing RNA species present in human thyroid medullary carcinoma tissue directs the synthesis of calcitonin precursor polyprotein s .f. Construction of recombinant cD. A plasmids using total poly A containing RNA isolated from a human medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. All manipulations followed the procedures outlined for the construction of recombinant plasmids containing human and guinea pig milk protein cDNA sequences see traig et al., 1981 Hall et al., 1981 except where specifically stated in the Methods section using the overall strategy outlined in Briefly, cDNA representative of the total poly A FIg.6. containing RNA population isolated from the human medullary carcinoma of the thyroid was synthesized by using AMV reverse transcriptase. Size analysis using agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the bulk of the cDNA synthesized ranged in size from 500 to 1500 nucleotides in length. This was converted to a double stranded form using AMV reverse transcriptase, followed by S1 nuclease excision of the resultant hairpin loop. This population was then sized by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis and those sequences ranging from 300 to 2500 nucleotides in length were eluted from the gel, and their 3 hydroxyl termini extended with poly dC 50 using calf thymus terminal deoxynucleotid transferase. This population was then annealed with PstI restricted pAT153 DNA which had previously been extended at the 3 hydroxyl termini with poly dG 12. The resulting chimaeric molecules were used to tranform a rec A strain of E.coli HB101 under conditions of good microbiological practice. Transformants were selected on L agar plates containing tetracycline, and colonies containing recombinant plasmids were then selected by replica plating onto L agar containing ampicillin alone, or tetracycline alone. In total a single transformation using 20ng of double stranded tailed cDNA yielded 107 colonies that had lost sensitivity to ampicillin, and therefore were presumed to contain cDNA sequences inserted at the PstI site of pAT153.g. Identification and characterization of recombinant plasmids containing human calcitonin cDNA sequences. It was apparent from cell free protein synthesizing studies that the human medullary carcinoma of the thyroid poly A containing RNA population contained an abundant mRNA population which directed the synthesis of calcitonin precursor polyprotein s . Consequently total base cleaved 32P labelled poly A containing RNA from human medullary carcinoma was used to identify, in a preliminary manner using in situ hybridization procedures, those colonies most likely to contain calcitonin precursor polyprotein cDNA sequences see the Methods section . All the ampillin sensitive colonies were screened in this manner, and 17 16 showed significant hybridization over the background.Of these, 11 were selected and grown in liquid culture, the plasmid DNA was isolated, and the presence of additional DNA sequence determined by digestion with the restriction endonuclease PstI, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. This confirmed that all but one contained additional DNA as compared with the parental plasmid pA153. The detailed characterization of two plasmids, phT B3 and phT B6, is described. Size analysis of the inserted cDNA sequences by agarose gel electrophoresis after excision of the cONA by digestion with the restriction endonuclease PstI, showed Fig.2A that phT B3 and phT 86 contained 590 and 490 base pairs of inserted sequence. Identification of the coding sequences present in each plasmid was carried out by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the wheat germ cell free translation products of mRNA isolated by hybridization under stringent conditions to partially restricted denatured plasmidDNA immobilized on DBM paper filters see Craig et al., 1981 . This demonstrated that both plasmids contained DNA sequences complementary to the medullary thyroid carcinoma mRNA species which directed the synthesis of the abundant calcitonin precursor protein Fig.9n . In each instance, although cell free protein synthesis was performed in the presence of 2.5mt lg , , both the 21000 and 18000 molecular weight calcitonin precursor polyprotein forms were present.Subsequent mapping of these sequences using a variety of restriction endonucleases Fig.2C showed that both recombinant plasmids contained cRNA sequence in common, but that phT B3 contained an additional sequence at one end of the common fragment and phT 86 an additional sequence at the other. To determine the proportion of the calcitonin precursor polyprotein oRNA sequence within the characterized recombinants, the size of the mRNA was estimated using RNA blotting techniques Alwine, 3. C Kemp, D.J. Stark, G.R. 1977 Proc. Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A. 74, 5350 5354 after separation of glyoxal treated poly A containing RNA McMaster, G.K. Carmichael, G.G. 1977 Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A. 74, 4835 4838 by horizontal agarose gel electrophoresis Fig.3 . This demonstrated that the human calcitonin precursor polyprotein mRNA was 1000e100 nucleotides in length. Thus the cDNA sequence inserted into phT B3 and phT B6 represented in total 60 650 of the mRNA sequence.A parallel analysis of the non polyadenylated human thyroid medullary carcinoma RNA also revealed the presence of calcitonin precursor polyprotein mRNA of identical length, but also discrete bands of lower molecular weight, either partially degraded mR2lA or discrete lower molecular weight mONA species containing sequence in common with the defined calcitonin sequence see Fig.4 . Calcitonin precursor polyprotein mRNA was not present in detectable amounts, under the conditions employed, in total poly A containing RNA isolated from fullterm human placental tissue, or from T 47D cells, a human cell line of mammary origin see Fig.3 .

As described above, Figure 4 shows the nucleotide sequence of the human calcitonin precursor polyprotein structural gene and the amino acids it encodes. The amino acids labelled 1 32 correspond to the previously known amino acid sequence of human calcitonin. The amino acid sequence 1 to 36 represents the previously unknown cryptic NH2 terminal flanking peptide, and the amino acid sequence 1 to 25 the cryptic carboxylterminal flanking peptide. Arrows define the region of nucleotide sequence which may be deduced from the adjacentDNA sequencing ladder. Boxed amino acids 2 and 1 1 to 4 represent predicted sites for proteolytic processing in vivo see Steiner D.F.,uinn, P.S. Chan.S.J.Marsh J. and Tager H.S. 1980 Ann. N.Y. Acad.Sci. 343, 1 16 . The glycine resdue 1 , an important consideration in the construction of the expression vectors described below, is in vivo required during processing events for the amidation of the adjacent carboxyl terminal amino acids Kreil, G., Suchanek, G. and Kindas Mugge, I. 1977 fled. Proc. 36, 2081 2086 . Thus in human calcitonin glycine 1 is required for the amidation of the carboxyl terminal proline residue 32 , a feature required for biological activity. Figure 5 defines the nucleotide sequencing strategy carried out using the chemical cleavage procedure ofMaxam A.M. and Gilbert W.Procn. Natn. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74 560 564 1977 . Figure 6 depicts the overall cloning strategy. There now follows a description of the production, using the expression vector designated pOT37, the combination therewith of the human calcitonin sequence derived from plasmid phT P,3 to produce a fusion protein, and the production therefrom of either human calcitonin or human calcitonin with an additional glycine residue at the carboxy terminal end. ISOLATION OF THE TRYPTOPF..MI PROMOTER AND TRP E GENEThe tryptophan operon has been the subject of much attention in recent years. The result of this is the elucidation of the complete nucleotide sequence of the five structural genes and their control regions C Yanofsky et al Nucleic acids Res 9, 6647 6668, 1981 . The control regions and parts of the structural genes have also been used to construct vectors for the expression of foreign genes B E Enger Valk et al Gene 9, 69 85, t980 W Tacon, N Carey and J S Emtage, Molec Gen Genet 177, 427 433, 1980 R A Hallewell andJ S Emtage, Gene 9, 27 47, 1980 .Earlier work had also shown that the control regions and the complete trp E gene could be isolated from the E coli chromosome on a Hind III fragment of a 5700 bp A S Eopkins, N E Murray and W J Brammar J Mol Biol 107, 549 569, 1976 .The E coli operon has also been isolated from the DNA of trp transducing strains of phages d 80 and X B E Enger VaLk et al loc cit . Alternatively, the control region and trp E gene can be isolated using cosmid vectors and in vitro packaging B Hohn and K murrayProc Natl Acad Sci USA 74, 3259 3262, 1977 Collins, J and John, BProc Natl Acad Sci USA 75, 4242 4246, 1978 . Thus, E coli chromosomal DNA was partially digested with Sau 3A and the resulting fragments ligated to the 10.3 kb cosmid 3030 that had previously been divested to completion with Bam HI. The cosmid 3030 contains a unique site for Bam HI and confers resistance to ampicillin. After ligation, the mixture was packaged in vitro and used to infect a trp E strain of E coli K12.Recombinants were selected on L agar plates containing ampicillin from which they were replica plated onto M9 salts, glucose, casamino acids minimal agar plates supplemented with ampicillin.Recombinants were thus selected that complemented the trp E strain by their ability to grow in the absence of tryptophan. Several recombinants were identified and plasmid DNA isolated and characterised by restriction enzyme analysis. One cosmid, designated 3030 trp, producing a 5700 bp fragment on digestion with Hind III was selected for further use.Cosmid 3030 trp was digested with Hind III, the fragments separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and the 5700 bp fragment recovered from a gel slice. Finally, this 5700 bp fragment was cloned into the Hind III site of pAT153 to produce the plasmid ptrp E5700. CONSTRUCTION OF pCT12A schematic representation of a portion of the tryptophan promotercontaining fragment is given in Fig 7 From this figure it can be seen that the complete tryptophan promoter operator complex can be isolated on a Taq I restriction fragment of 234 base pairs bp if the DNA is digested under conditions where about 50 of the available sites are cleaved. Thus, 10 ug of ptrp E5700 was incubated in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.4, 100 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2 and 6 mM ss mercaptoethanol at 650C for 20 minutes with 4 units of Tag I. After incubation the reaction mixture was extracted with phenol, precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in water and electrophoresed on a 5 polyacrylamide gel.After electrophoresis the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and the 234 bp DNA band excised from the gel and the DNA recovered A M Maxam and W Gilbert, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 74, 560 564, 1977 .This DNA fragment was then inserted into the Cla I site of the plasmid pAT153 Twigg and Sherratt, Nature 283, 216, 1980 . 10 ug of pAT153 was digested to completion with Cla I and the 5 phosphate groups removed by incubation at 37 C for 1 hour with 0.5 units of calf intestine aLkaline phosphatase in 10 m 4 Tris HCl, pH 8.This procedure prevents the plasmid recircularising in the absence of an insertedDNA fragment. 100 ng of the above treated pAT153 was ligated at 150C for 4 hours to 5 ng of the 234 bp DNA in a reaction containing 50 51 Tris ECl pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mt1 dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP and 20 units of T4 DNA ligase.The ligated DNA was then used to transform competent E coli K 12 strain EB101 Boyer, H X and Roulland Dussoix, DJ Mol Biol 41, 459 472, 1969 by standard techniques Hershfield, V et al Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 71, 3455 3459, 1974 and the bacteria plated on L agar plates containing 100 Ag ml ampicillin. Several ampicillin resistant colonies were selected,plasmid DNA prepared and the presence of the 234 bp fragment confirmed by restriction analysis.The resulting plasmid, designated pCT12, has the structure shown in Fig .8. It should be pointed out that insertion of the Taq fragment into the CIa I site reforms a CIa I site at the end downstream from the trp promoter.MODIFICATION OF nCT12 pcTl2 was further modified to produce pCT28 and pCT29 as follows.2 ssg of pCT12 was digested to completion with Hind III and then incubated at 200C for 30 minutes with 60 units of SI nuclease in a buffer containing 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.3 M NaCl and 1 mM zinc acetate to remove the protruding Hind III ends. The reaction was terminated by raising the pH to 7.6 and extracting the mixture with phenol chloroform 1 1 . The DNA was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and a sample incubated with T4 DNA ligase as described above and then used to transform E coli K12 strain HB101. Several ampicillin resistant clones were selected, plasmid DNA prepared and the absence of the Hind III site confirmed hy restriction analysis.The resulting plasmid, designated pCT28, has the structure shown inFig a. pCT2S was further modified. 2 ssg of EcoRI digested pCT2S was incubated with 4 units of E coli DNA polymerase for 15 minutes at 100C in a reaction containing 50 mM Tris HCl pK 7.6, 10 mM MgCl, 10 mM ss mercaptocthanol, 0.2 mM dATP and 0.2 mM TTP. After incubation the mixture was extracted with phenol, with chloroform and then ethanol precipitated.This treatment causes the 4 nucleotides complementary to the 5t protruding ends of the EcoRI site to be filled in 5 AATTC5 AATTC 3 EMI22.1 3 TTAAG 0.6 g of the above treated pCT28 was treated with 50 units ofT4 DNA ligase in the presence of 30 picomoles of the 5 phosphorylated synthetic oligonucleotide pCCAAGCTTGG and in 10 ul T4 DNA ligase buffer at 250C for 16 hours. The mixture was then heated at 700C for 10 minutes to stop the reaction and the linkers cleaved by digestion with Hind III. The linear DNA, now with Hind III ends, was separated from the linkers by electrophoresis on an agarose gel from which it was subsequently recovered by electroelution and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Ligation, followed by transformation ofE coli K 12 strain BBl0l, isolation of plasmid DNA and identification of plasmids with Hind III and EcoRI sites, produced the plasmid designated pCT29.PREPARATION OF pCT29 FOR CLONING TRP E G2NE pCT29, Fig 9, contains the E Coli tryptophan promoter operator region and, as well, unique restriction sites for the enzymes Cla I,Hind III and EcoRI downstream of the promoter region. mso of these sites, the Cla I and Hind III sites, were used to insert the trp E gene 5 g of pCT29 was cleaved with CIa I and the 5 grotrudinq ends filled in as described above using E coli DNA polymerase in the presence of dCTP and dGTp. The polymerase reaction mixture was extracted with phenol, then with chloroform and the DNA finally precipitated with ethanol.The filled in DNA was then digested with Hind III and the resulting fragments separated by agarose gel electrophoresis.The largest fragment was isolated from the gel by first staining with ethidium bromide, locating the DNA with ultraviolet light and cutting from the gel the portion of interest. The DNA was recovered from the gel fragment by electroelution and concentrated by ethanol precipitation.ISOLATION OF THE TRP E GENEThe trp E gene is present on the plasmid ptrp E5700, a portion of which is shown in Fig 1 0. As described above however, ptrp E5700 also contains the trp attenuator, a region concerned in the control attenuator region 5ug of of transcription from the trp attenuator as follows. To remove the ptrp E5700 was digested with Kpa I and then treated with nuclease BAL 31.This nuclease is a highly specific nuclease that can be used to shorten DNA fragments from the ends. Further, its action produces blunt ended molecules. 5 ssg of Epa I digested ptrp E5700 was treated with 1.5 units of BAL 31 nuclease in 0.6 M NaCl, 12 mM CaCI2, 12 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA at 300C for 1.5 minutes. The mixture was then phenol extracted, chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated. This treatment removes 150 250 bp from each end of the DNA fragments and so will remove the attenuator region from cost molecules as it is 150 b from the Hpa I site.The above treatedDNA fragments were digested to completion with Hind III and then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA containing the trp E gene was isolated from the gel by first staining the gel with ethidium bromide, locating the DNA with ultraviolet light and cutting from the gel DNA in the size range 1800 1850 bp. This DNA was recovered from the gel fragment by electroelution and concentrated by ethanol precipitation.INSERTION OF THE TRP E GEODE INTO pCT29The trp E fragments isolated above can be inserted into pCT29 that had been modified as described above. Fig 10 illustrates the ligation reaction. 0.2 ssg of modified pCT29 and 80 ng of the trp E fragment were incubated at 200C for 16 hours with 100 units T4 DNA ligase in 50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 10 n MgCl2, 1 mM ATP and 20 m1 dithiothreitol.The mixture was then used to transform E ccli K12 strain EiB101. as described above and transformants selected on L agar plates containing ampicillin. Several ampicillin resistant colonies were selected, plasmid DNA isolated and examined by restriction analysis. This analysis confirmed the presence of the trp E gene and the loss or the alternator region. One of the plasmids with these characteristics, designated pCT37, was selected for further work involving the human calcitonin gene.CALCITONIN AND CALCITONIN GLY FUSIONS WITH TRP EThe scheme outlined in Fig11 shows the steps carried out to combine the human calcitonin sequence derived from plasmid phT B3 with the expression vector pCT37 described above to produce fusion proteins.The initial step involves the modification of the calcitonin sequence so that the ultimate amino acid in the fusion protein is either the proline corresponding to the authentic terminal amino acid in calcitonin or so that a further glycine is translated. The purpose of this construction relates to the final processing envisaged in calcitonin production and is described fully below.20 Ug of phT B3 were incubated in 6 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 6 mM MgCl2, 6 mM ss m.ercaptoethanol and 20 mM KCl with 10 units of Est NI for 60 minutes at 600C. After incubation the reaction was made 0.3 M in NaAcetate pE 6.0, extracted with phenol, then chloroform and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The precipitated DNA was washed with 70 ethanol, dried under vacuum and redissolved in 20 ul of water Step i Fig 11. Bst NI cuts the calcitonin sequence only in the proline at position 32 and in such a way that the T residue in the anti coding strand is removed.This T residue is added back in the next step ii . 10 Ug of the Bst NI cleavedphT B3 were incubated in 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM B mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM dCTP, 0.2 mM dTTP and 6 units of Klenow enzyme DNA polymerase large fragment supplied by the Boehringer Corporation London Ltd .After the incubation the DNA was phenol extracted, chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, washed in 70 ethanol and redissolved in 10 ul of water. The resulting DNA is now flush ended and can be ligated to other flush ended DNA molecules. The DNA was ligated covalently joined with two separate synthetic oligonucleotides designated A or B in Fig 11. A TAGGATCCTA ATCCTAGGAT B GGTTGATCAACC CCAACTAGTTGG Thus 2.5 Ug of the phT B3 derived DNA fragments were incubated in separate reactions with 400 ng of oligonucleotides A or B in 60 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5, 8 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 8 mercaptoethanol, 1 mM ATP and 1.5 ul T4 DNA ligase New England Biolabs Lot 17 for 24 hours at 160C. Ligase activity was destroyed by raising the temDerature to 700C for 5 minutes and the DNA ethanol precipitated, washed in 70 ethanol, dried under vacuum and redissolved in 10 ul of water.1 ul of both DNA samples ie ligated with oligonucleotide A or B was analysed for efficient ligation, as evidenced by its increase in size through concatetnarisation and visualised by staining an agarose gel with ethidium bromide following an electrophoretic size separation. Note that the two ligation reaction samples represent the start of two separate and parallel construction routes ie A or B gs shown in Fig11. The description of the experiments below apply for both series of constructions. The remaining plasmid DNA 9 ul was separated from unreacted oligonucleotides by Sephadex G 50 chromatography and concentrated by ethanol precipitation.The DNA was redissolved in 50 ul 6 mM Tris HCl, 50 mM NaCl,6 mM MgCl2, 6 mM ss mercaptoethanol and excess Sau 3A enzyme added to ensure complete cutting at all Sau 3 sites after l hour at 370C.The linker oligonucleotides contain the Sau 3A recognition sequence 5 GATC 3 and the Bgl II site 5 t AGATCT 3 is also a Sau 3A site so that after the Sau 3A digestion, the calcitonin sequence resides in DNA fragments about 110 base pairs long the exact length differing by one nucleotide depending on whether oligonucleotideA or B was used . These fragments were isolated following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE as described above Step iv Fig11 and following ethanol precipitation, were dissolved in water 10 ssl . The vector expression plasmid pCT37 described in detail above was prepared for their ligation into the Bgl II site as follows. 10 ug of pCT37 was incubated in 6 . Tris HCl, 50 t iM NaCl, 6 rn4 MgCl23 6 mM B mercaptoethanol and 10 units Bgl II for 60 minutes at 37 C The linearised DNA was diluted to 0.5 ml and made 0.3 M in sodium acetate pH 6.0. 5 Phosphate groups were removed by the addition of 3 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ClAP and incubation at 60 C for thirty minutes, after which a further 3 units of CIAP was added and a further 30 minute incubation carried out.Phosphatase activity was destroyed by one phenol, two chenol chloroEorm and three chloroform extractions, after which the DNA was ethanol precipitated and redissolved in water 10 ul . In Step vi the calcitonin containing fragments were ligated into the Bgl II site of pCT37 as follows. 0.1 ug of the Bgl II linearised and CIAP treated pCT37 was incubated with approximately 2 ng of the calcitonin containing fragments in 60 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 8 mM MgCl21 10 mM 8 mercaptoethanol, 1 mM ATP and 0.2 ul T4 DNA ligase New England Biolabs Lot 17 for 16 hours at 160C.The DNA was then used to transform frozen competentB coli HB101 using standard methods cf Methods in Enzymology Vol 68, pp 326 331 and transformants resistant to ampicillin selected onL agar plates containing 100 ssg ml ampicillin.Clones containing plasmids with the calcitonin sequence in the Bgl II site and in the correct orientation were dentified and the constructions confirmed by DNA sequencing using the method of Maxam, A and Gilbert, W ProcNatl Acad Sci 74, 560 t977 . At this stage the calcitonin DNA translation reading frame is out of phase with the trp E gene reading frame and if this reading frame is being used by a ribosome, a stop codon TAA will be encountered after amino acid 322 of the trp E gene.Thus in contrast to the parent expression vector pCT37 which directs the overproduction of the trp E gene product, these constructions would be expected to direct the overproduction of a novel truncated protein 323 amino acids long ie about 35K Daltons 1 Wt . That such a novel protein is indeed produced by coli harbouring these plasmids and only under appropriate inducing conditions, is see below .illustrated in Fig 12 Thus the final steps in the construction of plasmids directing the overproduction of the desired trp E calcitonin or calcitonin gly fusion proteins requires the calcitonin sequence to be brought into the same translation reading frame as the trp E gene. This can be achieved by adding 3n 2 nucleotides at the fusion junction between the trp E sequence and the calcitonin sequence ie at the recreated unique Bgl II site . The synthetic octomer 5 G A T C C C G G G G C C C T A G is suitable since it is of the correct length 8 3 x 2 2 , has an appropriate 5 overhang for ligation into the Bgl II site and in addition creates a new unique restriction site for the enzyme Sma 5 CCCGGG 3 at the fusion junction.Thus the plasmids l0 ssg were incubated in 6 mM Tris HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 6 mM B mercaptoethanol, 6 mM MgC12 with 10 units Bgl II and the phosphate groups removed from the linear molecules using CIAP as described above. Following phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation 0.1 Rg of the linear DNA was incubated with a 10 fold molar excess of the synthetic oligonucleotide GATCCCGG G G C C T A G in 60 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 8 mM MgC12, 10 mM S mercaptoethanol, 1 mM ATP and 0.2 ul T4 DNA ligase,for 16 hours at 160C step ix Fig 11 . The ligation products were used to transform E coli His101 cells and ampicillin resistant transformed cloned isolated on L agar plates containing 100 Ag m ampicillin .The majority of plasmidsin these clones were found to contain more than one copy of the synthetic oligonucleotide at the fusion junction.1 ug of plasmids with 2 inserted linkers was linearised by incubation in 6 mM Tris HCl, 6mM MgCl2, 6mM beta mercaptoethanol and 20mM YCl with 19 units of Sma I supplied by the Poehringer Corporation London Ltd , and following purification of the linear molecules from unlinearised plasmid, the DNA was religated with T4 DNA ligase and following a further round of transformation into HOlO plasmids with the structure shown at the bottom of Fig.11. were isolated.As illustrated the DNA junction is now such that the calcitonin sequence is in phase with the trp E sequence and such plasmids showed there fore direct the production of a novel fusion protein of the expected size about 38KDaltons M St, see Fig.12 . Verification of these con structions has been demonstrated in the following manner.Thus E.Coli cells harbouring either ne plasmids i.e. HOlOl cells described above, Fig.12 lane a or harbouring pcT37 lanes b and c or harbouring the constructions described above in which a stop codon is found after 323 amino acids lanes d and e were grown at 370C either in L broth lanes a and b in which the trp promotor is not induced, or in M9 salts in which it is lanes c,d,e,f,g see alsoR.A.Hallewell and J.S.Emtage, Gene 9, 27 47, 1950 and harvested by centrifugation. The cells were dissolved in SDS sample buffer Laemmli, U,K.Nature 227, 680 1970 .Protein equivalent to 50 il of original culture was electrophoresed on a 12.5 w v polyacrylamide gel and the secarated proteins visualized by staining with coomassie blue.It is clear from Fig.12 that pcT37 under conditions ofTrp promotor Induction overproduces the Trp E gene lane c, indicated by arrow cf. lane b, where growth is under noninduced conditions . In contrast, in its out of phase calcitonin containing derivatives lane d has the A type end defined in Fig.11 . while e has the B type end an appropriate sized novel protein is present as indicate. tlhere the two constructions contain the calci tonin sequence in phase lane f in the A type and lane g the B type construction novel proteins of the expected size can be seen. Identification of the presence of the calcitonin pep tide with bacterial cell lysates was performed by radioimmunoassay. The assay was carried out essentially as described by SI Girgis et al., 3.Endocrinol 78, 372 382 . As can be seen in Figure 13, dilutions from a lysate of an E.coli carrying the calcitonin gene inserted out of phase failed to compete out the 125I labelled human calcitonin. In contrast lysates obtained from E.coli carrying constructions of the calcitonin gene both A and B inserted in phase competed with 125I labelled human calcitonin in the expected manner for comparison compare with calcitonin standard . This confirms that the constructions resulted in the synthesis of a fusion protein containing the expected antigenic determinants of human calcitonin. CALCITONI.N FROM .4 TRP E CALCITONIN FUSION PROTEIN The ultimate aim of introducing the human calcitonin sequence into the trp E gene of E.coli in such a way that substantialiquantities of a trp E calcitonin fusion protein are produced is to liberate the calcitonin peptide in a commercially viable way. This may be done by several possible routes. As a first step the calcitonin peptide must be cleaved from the fusion protein. This can be achieved by the use of the enzyme typsin which will cleave exactly at the fusion junction since the initial cysteine residue is preceded by an arginine. Calcitonin contains no arginines but one lysine residue at position 18 which would also be liable to trypsin cleavage.This lysine can however be protected by citraconic anhydride Shine S,Fettes I, Nancy C.Y.Lan, Roberts,J.L.and Baxter,J.D. Nature 285, 456 461 . The peptide liberated by this procedure differs from authentic calcitonin only in that in authentic calcitonin the C terminal amino acid is a prolinamide rather than a proline or proline glycine amino acid. Conversion of the liberated peptide into authentic calcitonin is possible through the use ofC terminal modification activity of yeast carboxypeptidaseY Breddam, K, Widmer, F and Johanson, J.T.Carlsberg Res.Commun. 45, 237 247 and 361 367 1980 . Quite apart from the biological use of calcitonin produced in accordance with the invention, the availability of a cloned human calcitonin cDNA probe, also made possible by the invention, permits comparisons to be drawn between human calcitonin gene structure and expression in normal thyroid tissue, and in familial and sporadic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The probes may also be used for definitive studies of the molecular mechanisms involved in the ectopic synthesis of calcitonin, in particular by lung carcinoma, whilst the possibility also arises that cDNA probes may be used to investigate lined DNA polymorphisms, thereby providing a quick and reliable means of distinguishing between familial and sporadic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, saving patients and their relatives from uncomfortable, extensive and often invasive investigations.
