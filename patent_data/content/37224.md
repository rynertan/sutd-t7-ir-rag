## Description
Rare Earth Metal Carboxylates, Their Use As Antimicrobial Agents, And Medicinal, Cosmetic And Cleansing Compositions Containing Them The desirability of controlling or eradicating common disease causing microorganisms on, e.g., the bodies of humans and lower animals, textiles, hard surfaces, etc., is clearly accepted. For use on humans and other animals, it is highly desirable to provide compositions for controlling microorganisms without harming the host. When the microorganisms are bacteria, it is usually desirable to use antimicrobial agents that are capable of killing or controlling both Gram positive and Gram negative species. The present invention provides rare earth metal carboxylate surfactant compounds which are excellent antimicrobial agents for use in a wide variety of products. Various cationic and halogenated antimicrobial agents are known in the art. However, the present compounds offer several advantages over the art disclosed antimicrobials.The compounds herein are less toxic, orally, than the common cationic surfactant type antimicrobials, and they are less persistent in the environment than the halogenated antimicrobials. In contrast with many of the art disclosed antimicrobials, microorganisms do not appear to form mutant strains resistant to the present compounds. The compounds herein can be used at low concentrations to control bothGram positive and Gram negative bacteria, and they are acceptably mild even when relatively high concentrations are used in contact with skin. Moreover, they kill or control bacteria with only minimal contact time. Accordingly, the antimicrobial compounds herein are especially useful in hard surface cleaners, cosmetics and oral compositions such as dentifrices arid mouthwashes. Background Art us Belgian Patent 856,751 disclosures cerium salts of sulfadiazine, especially cerous sulfadiazine, for treating burns. These salts bbtained from reacting watersoluble salts of cerium, for example, cerium chloride or cerium nitrate, with an aqueous solution of sulfadiazine, for example, sodium sulfadiazine. The cerium salt of sulfadiazine is said to display antibacterial activity at low concentrations of 0.05 micromole ml. A. Yu Zimakov, et al., RARE EARTH ELEMENTS IN MEDICINE Kazanskii Meditsinskii Zhurnal, 57 3 268 271 1976 , relates generally to the antibacterial activity of rare earth metals. More specifically, this article discusses the antibacterial activity of inorganic salts of rare earth mentals, e.g., cerium nitrate at 1000 ppm inhibits Staphylococcus and molds. Reference was made to the therapeutic benefits of sulfates of neodymium, praseodymium, samarium and acetates of lanthanum in the treatment of tuberculosis. Sudi Burkes, et al., THE BACTERIOSTATIC ACTIVITYOF CERIUM, LANTHAtYlM AND THALLIUM, Journal of Bacteriology 54 417 24 1947 , reports the bacteriostatic properties of the captioned rare earth metals at concentrations ranging from 0.0006 to 0.0012 M. Inorganic salts of the captioned rare earth metals were found to have bacteriostatic properties at these concentrations. Charles Levinson, et al., LANTHANUM INDUCEDALTERATION IN CELLULAR ELECTROLYTES AND MEMBRANE POTENTIALIN EHRLICH ASCITES TUMOR CELLS, Journal of CellularPhysiology 79 299 308 1971 , reports the effect of lanthanum at varying concentrations from 0.01 to 2.0 nM on membrane potential and electrolyte composition of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. La 3 concentrations less than 0.02 iti had no effect. At 1.0 mM the effect was maximal and resulted in an 87 reduction in cellular potassium, 79 reduction in chloride ions and 21 reduction in sodium within 4.8 minutes. The sodium loss occurred even in the face of an electrochemicRl potential gradient favoring 3.sodium entry. In shorty this article shows that La affects the permeability of animal cell membranes.

Summary of the Invention The present invention encompasses water soluble compounds of th formula RCO2 3M , wherein M is a rare earth metal cation and R is a C8 C18 hydrocarbyl ethoxylate group containing from about 1 to about 15 ethylene oxide units, a C8 C18 hydrocarbyl glyceryl ether group, a C8 C18 hydrocarbyl monoglyceride group, a C8 C1g hydrocarbyl ester group, or an ammonium phosphonium or sulfonium group of the formulaEMI4.1 RÚ A4 R3 or RÚ CH wherein RÚ is a C8 C22 hydrocarbyl group, each Rê is aC1 C4 hydrocarbyl group or an ethylene oxide group containing from 1 to about 5 ethylene oxide units, x is 2 when A is N or P and x is 1 when A is S, and R is a Cl ClO hydrocarbyl group or an ethylene oxide group containing from 1 to about 10 ethylene oxide units. The invention also encompasses antimicrobial compositions comprising the above described compounds. The invention further encompasses methods for controlling microorganisms comprising contacting said microorganisms with a microorganism controlling amount of the compounds or compositions of the foregoing type. Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention is based on the discovery that compounds formed by combining certain rare earth metals and anionic or zwitterionic carboxylate surfactants possess synergistic antimicrobial properties. The term synergisticl as used herein means that combinations of the two discrete entities, i.e., the rate earth metal and the surfactant, provide antimicrobial activity far greater than either entity alone. Inorganic rare earth salts such as the lanthanum salts do not, by themselves, possess appreciable bactericidal activity This is demonstrated by the following data obtained from standard tests for measuring Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations using a 10 minute contact with the test agent at 37 C representing at least a 3 log unit reduction in viable cell count . Minimum Bactericidal ConcentrationCompound E. coli S . aureNis LaCl3.6H2O 3500 ppm 3500 ppmLa NO3 3.6H2O 4300 ppm 4300 ppmLa2 SO4 3.8H2O 7100 ppm 7100 ppm Certain anionic and zwitterionic surfactants are somewhat bactericidal to Gram positive bacteria at moderate to high concentrations, but none possess appreciable activity against Gram negative bacteria. However, it is believed that the rare earth metals potentiate the antimicrobial activity of the anionic and zwitterionic surfactants herein, rendering them bactericidal at low concentrations to both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.As will be demonstrated more fully hereinafter, these rare earth metal surfactant compounds provide superior, broadscale antimicrobial agents suitable for use in a wide variety of products. The antimicrobial compounds of the present invention comprise 1 a rare earth metal component M3 , and 2 a water soluble surfactant component RCO2 The Rare Earth Mental Component The rare earth metals useful in the compounds and compositions of the instant invention have a valence state of 3 and are selected from the group consisting of scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium. Mixtures of these metals e.g., the so called didymium salts can also be used. Preferably, the rare earth metal is selected from lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, erbium, ytterbium, and mixtures thereof.Most preferably, the rare earth metal is lanthanum. Lanthanum is readily available, inexpensive and stable over the broad pH range disclosed herein. It is noteworthy that rare earth metals having a valence state of 4, for example cerium IV, or a valence state of 2 are not effective for use in the present invention. Other polyvalent metals, such as aluminum, calcium, magnesium, iron, and indium are also ineffective as components in the instant antimicrobial compositions. The rare earth metals herein are used in the form of their water soluble salts, such as the chlorides, nitrates, or sulfates. The chloride salts are especially preferred. The Surfactant Component The surfactants useful in the present invention are certain anionic and zitterionic surfactants having a hydrophilic, water solubilizing carboxylate end group and a hydrophobic hydrocarbyl tail . In the general formula for the antimicrobial compounds herein, the water soluble surfactant component is represented by the formula RCO2 , wherein R is a C 5 C18 hydrocarboy ethoxylate group containing from about 1 to about 15 ethylene oxide units, a C8 C18 hydrocarbyl glyceryl ether group, a C8 C18 hydrocarbyl monoglyceride group, a C8 C18 hydrocarbyl ester group, or an ammonium phosphonium or sulfonium group of the formula EMI7.1 wherein R1 is a C8 C22 hydrocarbyl group, each R2 is a C C hydrocarbyl group or an ethylene oxide group containing from 1 to about 5 ethylene oxide units, x is 2 when A is N or P and x is 1 when A is S, and R3 is a C1 C10 hydrocarbyl group or an ethylene oxide group containing from 1 to about 10 ethylene oxide units. As used herein, the term hydrocarbyl is intended to describe any straight or branched chain alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkaryl e.g., alkyl phenyl or alkyl benzyl , or substituted hydrocarbyl e.g., hydroxyalkyl group. Of course, the R substituent herein could be any of the corresponding groups based on the alkene series. It will also be recognized that for chemical stability or ease of synthesis, various short chain alkylene e.g., methylene or ethylene , hydroxyalkylene or alkenylene groups can be used to connect the above R substituents with the CO2 group. With respect to the anionic surfactant components described above, R is preferably a C8 C18 alkyl or alkyl phenyl ethoxylate group containing from 1 to about 15 ethylene oxide units, a C8 C14 alkyl glyceryl ether group, a C8 C14 alkyl monoglyceride group, or a C8 C14 alkyl ester group. More preferably R is a C C18 alkyl ethoxylate group containing from about 3 to about 10 ethylene oxide units.Most preferably, R is a C12 C16 alkyl ethoxylate group containing from about 6 to about 8 ethylene oxide units. It is to be understood that simple alkyl and alkyl aryl carboxylates are not useful as the surfactant component herein because they form poorly soluble precipitates with the rare earth metals. Typical exarrtplas of anionic surfactants useful herein include the alkyl glyceryl ether carboxylates, especially those ethers of the higher alcoho ls derived from tallow and coconut oil coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride var boxylates carboxylic acid derivatives of th reaction product of one mole of a higher fatty alcohol e.g., tallow or coconut alcohols and from about 3 to about 10, preferably about 6 to about 8, moles of ethylene oxide Cg alkyl phenyl ethylene oxide carboxylates containing about 4 units of ethylene oxide per molecule and monococonutalkyl esters of succinic acid, maleic acid, and tartaric acid. Zwitterionic surfactants useful herein, along with methods of synthesis, are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,862,058,Nirschl, et al., issued January 21, 1975 U.S. Patent 4,051,234, Gieske, et al., issued September 27, 1977 and U.S. Patent 2,199,397, Engelmann, issued May 7, 1940, all incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, a preferred process for preparing alphÅa halo carboxylic acids, from which the alpha substituted zwitterionic surfactants herein can be derived, is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,148,811,Crawford, issued April 10, 1979, incorporated herein by reference. In the general formula for the zwitterionic surfactants herein, R is preferably an ammonium group. More preferably R is a C12 C22 alkyl dimethyl ammonio group in which R is a C1 Cs alkylene group. Most preferably, R is 3 a C12 Cl6 alkyl dimethyl ammonio group in which R is a C3 C5 alkylene group. Specific examples of other anionic and zwitterionic surfactants useful herein include C12 13 alkyl triethoxy methylene carboxylate C9 alkyl phenyl hexaethoxy methylene carboxylate C16 pentaethoxy methylene carboxylate coconutalkyl ethoxy avg. 71 methylene carboxylate coconut monoglyceride methylene carboxylate 5 S methyl S dodecyl sulfonio 3 hydropentane 1 carboxylate 3 N,N dimethyl N decylammonio propane 1 carboxylate 3 N,N dimethyl Nhexadecylammonio 2 hydropxypropane 1 carboxylate 5 N,Ndi 3 hydroxypropyl n decylammonio 2 hydroxypentane 1carboxylate and 4 N,N dimethyldopdecylammonio butanoate. The rare earth surfactant compounds herein exhibit their antimicrobial properties in aqueous systems. The preparation of these compounds. involves simply admixing the anionic surfactant preferably in the form of an inorganic salt, such as the sodium, potassium or ammonium salt or the zwitterionic surfactant, water, and the water soluble rare earth metal salt, e.g., rare earth metal chloride preferred , nitrate or sulfate. In solution, the chloride, sulfate or nitrate radical would become the counter ion for the cationic charge center of the zwitterionic surfactant. Preferably the molar ratio of the surfactant to the rare earth metal salt is about 3 1, but ratios of from about 1 1 to about 10 1 surfactant rare earth metal salt can optionally be used.Once prepared, the rare earth surfactant compounds herein need not be isolated from solution in order to provide their desirable antimicrobial benefits, but can be used in situ. Since the compounds herein or their rare earth metal components precipitate from solution at pH s above about 8 see Moeller and revers, Chem. Rev. 37 114 1945 , it will be appreciated that the antimicrobial compositions herein should be manufactured and used in solution at a pH of less than about 8, and preferably from about 4 to about 8. Of course, compositions intended for oral use should have a pH above about 4 to avoid damage to dental enamel.Such compositions preferably have a pH of from about 4.5 to about 8. With certain species of microorganisms, especially with Pityrosporm ovale which is the causative microorganism for dandruff, the compositions herein are optimally active in the pH range of 4.0 4.5 The antimicrobials provided by the present invention can b2 usez in a wiac variety of products.Specific, but non limiting examples of compositions employing the instant antimicrobial agents. include orl products such as debtifrices toothpastes, toothpowders , mouthwashes, oral lozenges, and chewing gum, shampoos, l aundry or dishwashing detergent products, hard surface cleansers and sanitizers, skin sanit izers e.g., surgical scrubs, bar soaps , deodorants, eye drops, nose drops, and various other medicaments for use in treating human and lower animals, and th like. Oral products prepared according to this invention comprise a a safe and effective amount of the aforedescribed antimicrobial and b an orally acceptable carrier. For example, the carrier for mouthwashes can be water or an organic solvent such as various alcohols, or mixtures thereof. Mouthwashes generally comprise a water ethyl alcohol solution and optionally contain other ingredients such. as standard flavors, sweeteners, humectants, and the like, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,067,962,Juneja, issued January 10, 1978, incorporated herein by reference. The alcohol helps solubilize the rare earth surfactant antimicrobial, and controls product sudsing, etc. Mouthwashes according to this invention contain about 0.01 to 5.0 of the rare earth surfactant antimicrobial 0 to 40 ethyl alcohol 02 to 20t preferably 5 to 208 glycerine or other humectant 0 to 28 preferably 0.1 to 2 sudsing agent 0 to 0.5 preferably 0.05 to 0.5 sweetening agent such as saccharin and 0 to 0.3 preferably 0.05 to 0.38 flavoring agent and the balance, water. Dentifrices prepared according to the instant invention contain the instant antimicrobial, as well as various abrasive polishing materials, sudsing agents, flavoring and sweetening agents, humectants, binders and water. See U.S. Patent 4,067,962 for disclosures of typical materials and methods for preparing dentifrices. 11 Cewrtain ingredients used in many commercial dentifrice compositions are preferably avoided in dentifrices containing the present raXe earth surfactnt antimicrobials. For example, soluble fluorides react with the rare earths and precipitate as the metal fluorides. Certain phosphate dentifrice abrasives are somewhat soluble and can undesirably cause precipitation of rare earth phosphates. Various inert dentifrice abrasives useful herein are known, including, by way of example, the condensation products of urea and formaldehyde as disclosed by Cooley, et al. in U.S. Patent 3,070,510, issued December 25, 1962 silica xerogels such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,538,230 to Pader, et al., issued November 3, 1970 and mineral abrasives coated with cationic polymers such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,110,083, issued August 29, 1978, and in U.S. Patent 4,157,357, issued June 5, 1979, both to Benedict. The disclosures in the above patents are incorporated herein by reference. The antimicrobial compounds herein can also be used in oral products intended for ingestion by humans and lower animals. Such products would be effective in controlling bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. These compositions contain a safe and antimicrobially effective amount of the compounds herein and a non emetic carrier material. Suitable carrier materials are any of the usual pharmaceutical recipients, including water, alcohol, sugars, starches, cellulose and its derivatives, malt, gelatins and the like. Within the realm of sound medical judgment, the dosage of the antimicrobial compound to be administered in such oral products will vary with the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition, and the duration of treatment employed. However, single dosages can range from 1 to 100 milligrams mg per kg of body weight. The carrier employed in conjunction with the antimicrobial compound is used at a concentration sufficient to provide a practical size to. dosage relationship.Preferably, the pharmaceutical carrier comprises from about Q.18 to about 99 by alight of total oral composition. The antimicrobial compositions herein are also useful in a wide variety of situations where santization of environmental or body surfaces is desirable. Skin sanitizers comprising safe and antimicrobially effective amounts of the rare earth surfactant compositions and a cosmetically acceptable cleansing type carrier at a pH within the range from above about 4.5 to about pH 7, and shampoo compositions comprising a safe and antimicrobially effective amount of said compositions in an acceptable shampoo type carrier having a pH within the range of about to about 4.5, are typical of the uses of the present compositions. Likewise, hard surface sanitizing cleansers comprising the present compositions and hard surface cleanser type carriers are another use.Of courser any of these types of products are equally appropriate for both human and veterinary use, and any of the products exemplified can be used with pets and domestic animals of all types. As can be sen from the foregoing discussion and the following examples, the present invention provides an excellent method for controlling microorganisms, including bacteria and environmental or pathogenic fungi. The antimicrobial compounds herein are especially useful in water containing systems at a pH in the range of 4 to about 8. Aqueous compositions containing the rare earth surfactant compositions of this invention safely provide broad spectrum antimicrobials at usage levels in the range of ca 8 ppm, and above, preferably ca. 25 30 pp, and above, depending on the microorganism.
