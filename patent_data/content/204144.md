# Fluoroalkoxy cyclic phosphonitrile esters.

## Abstract
A fluoroalkoxy cyclic phosphonitrile ester represented by the formula 1 H CF₂CF₂ mCH₂O ₂n ℓ CF₃CF₂CH₂O ℓPnNn 1 wherein CF₂CF₂ m is a single segment of the unit CF₂CF₂ multiplied by an integer or indicates conjoint presence of segments having different chain lengths and each comprising the unit CF₂CF₂ multiplied by an integer, m is 2 in the case of the single segment or, in the case of the presence of segments of different chain lengths, represents the average of the chain lengths, means the average number of repeating units CF₂CF₂ and is in the range of 1.3 m 2.8, ℓ is in the range of 2 n 1 ℓ 1, and n is the number of repeating PN units of the phosphonitrile cyclic skeleton, or represents the average number of repeating PN units and is a real number in the range of 3 n 4.3 when rings of different numbers of repeating units are conjointly present.
