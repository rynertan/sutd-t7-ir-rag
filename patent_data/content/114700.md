# Automotive suspension system with vehicle height control.

## Abstract
An automotive suspension system includes a height control system 300 for controlling vehicle height and a damping force adjusting system 400 for adjusting damping force produced by a shock absorber 20 . The height control system and the damping force adjusting system are coordin ated such that the damping force is decreased when the height control system shifts the vehicle body upwards, and the damping force is increased when the height control system shifts the vehicle body downwards. Furthermore, the height control system is responsive to the height of the vehicle body and the vehicle speed to shift the vehicle body up and down so that the vehicle body is held to within a predetermined range of height.
