# Furnace heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A heat recovery system recovers heat from flue gases from a furnace 10 or the like and a hot water cylinder 50 . Flue gases are passed through series of chambers 24, 28, 30 in which coils 42, 44, 48 are located. Water is passed through the coils in a direction opposite to flue gas flow to maximise heat transfer and the heated water is passed to either a heat radiating system or into preheater tank for the hot water supply. The coils for the heat radiation and water heating are in separate circuits 40, 46 and the flue gases for the hot water is passed only over the coil 48 used for water heating. Pumps 15, 52 are used for water recirculation in both the heat radiating circuit and the water heating circuit. The system has application to domestic and industrial furnaces which provide gaseous combustion products with recoverable thermal energy and permits the use of a small diameter exhaust vent 23 without adversely affecting the ignition and combustion system of conventional furnaces.
