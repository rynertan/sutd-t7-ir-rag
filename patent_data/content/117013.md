# ADDITIVE FILM AND METHOD

## Abstract
The addtive film and photographic method for forming a hard gradation, maximum density image on such film involve association of a photoactive coating of a nitrogen containing compound on a transparent supporting film base of which the surface is hydrophilic and oleophobic. Image formation on this film is effected by exposing the surface carrying the nitrogen containing compound to ultraviolet light through an image bearing master and treating the exposed coating with an image developing emulsion.
