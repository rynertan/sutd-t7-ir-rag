## Description
COMPOSITIONS FOR USE IN PPEVENTING PROLIFERATION OF REMNANT LENS EPTTEIELIAL CELLS AFTER EXTRACAPSULAR EXTRACTION Extracapsular cataract extraction has recently become a more popular method of removing cataracts, probably because of its lower incidence of postoperative complications in terms of cystoid macular edema and possibl.e retinal detachment. The advent of an improved extracapsular extraction technique such as phacoemulsification and the requirement of an intact posterior lens capsule for implantation of a wide variety of intraocular lenses have certainly played an important role in influencing such a trend.The only possible disadvantage of extracapsular cataract extraction is the high incidence of posterior lens capsule opa.cification, which requires additional surgical procedures posterior capsulotomy or repolishing of the posterior lens capsule to cbtain good vision. The pathogenesis of posterior lens capsule opacification after extracapsular cataract extraction is known the remnant lens epithelial cells proliferate on the posterior lens capsule to form abortive lens fibers and bladder cells i.e. Elschnig s pearls . As reported in Contact and Intraocular LensMedical Journal, Vol. 5, o. LL, Oct Dc. 1979, pp. 175 178, After Cataract Studies of Chemical and RadiationInhibition, by Roy et al, chemical and radiation means have been attempted to try to find a method associated with extra5 1 sular cataract sureery which mould lower the incident of after cataract growth As reported in this publication the chemicals used vincristine and vinblastine were tried to chemically inhibit subcapsular epithelial cells because they had been found to have a direct inhibitory effect on cell mitosis Goodman, L.S., and Gillman, A The PharmacologicalBasis of Therapeutics, Maximilan, New York 1965, pp. 1373 1376 . Vincristine and vinblastine were found to inhibit the corneal wound so that it healed poorly, and because of the deletory effects to the cornea and iris it was the opinion of the authors that these drugs should not be used in further animal studies to try to inhibit subcapsular epithelial perforation.The authors further stated that radiation given the second day after surgery appeared to be the most effective of all dosage schedules, however, they indicate that there is some danger of injury, the authors concluding that it is difficult to say, however, that if one used radiation in humans whether there would be problems or not. The authors further pointed out that if there were a drug or chemical system that could be found which would inhibit selectively the subcapsular epithelial cells, this might be a useful way to help prevent after cataracts. PRIOR ART STATEMENT Applicants are unaware of any art teaching the inatillation of the mitotic inhibitors methotrexate and retinoic acid, or mixtures thereof, in the anterior chamber of the eye in minimal effective dosages at the end of one lens epithelial cell cycle, which instillation effectively prevents posterior lens capsule opacification without ocular compromise after extracapsular cataract extraction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a method of selectively inhibiting subcapsular epithelial growth by instilling mitotic inhibitors,that is, methotrexate or retinoic acid, or mixtures thereof, into the anterior chamber of the eye immediately following cataract surgery in initial concentrations to provide a minimal effective dosage of each agent. This is accomplished by realizing the minimally effective dosage of each agent, the lens epithelial cell cycle.time, the rate of aqueous humor formation and exit, and the volume of the anterior segment compartments after lens extraction. The initial concentration can then be calculated as set forth in the subsequent description of preferred embodiments. Colchicine, in such minimal effective dosage, prevents posterior lens capsule opacification, but with some optic nerve toxicity. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a method of selectively inhibiting the subcapsular epithelial cells to help prevent after cataracts. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of preventing future proliferation of the remnant lens epithelial cells, hence preventing the opacification of the posterior lens by instilling methotrexate, retinoic acid or colchicine or mixtures thereof, into the anterior chamber of the eye after extracapsular cataract extraction. A further object of the present invention is the provision of a method in which the drug is concentrated in the anterior segment compartments of the eye above the minimal effective dosage at the end of one lens epithelial cell cycle. Other and further objects, features and advantages appear throughout the specification and claims. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED D2ODIMENTS Mitotic inhibitors, methotrexate or retinoic acid at precalculated dosages are instilled into the anterior chamber of the eye, preferably immediately after extracapsular cataract extraction which effectively prevent future proliferation of remnant lens epithelial cells, hence preventing the opacification of the posterior lens capsule. Methotrexate is a cycle dependant antimetabolite, it inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase and thus interferes with the maintenance of intracellular pools of reduced folates. Retinoic Acid, the exact mechanism is unknown, appears to inhibit either cellular division or DNA synthesis or both . Colchicine arrests mitosis at metaphase by binding to a protein present in microtubules, hence interfering with the structure of the mitotic spindle. Methotrexate, retinoic acid and colchicine are all known chemical compounds, are readily available, and no detailed description thereof is given or deemed necessary. Since all of the structures in contact with the anterior and posterior chambers corneal endothelium, ciliary epithelium, iris pigment epithelium, muscle, and neural elements are postmitotic, cycle dependant mitotic inhibitors theoretically should affect only the actively dividing lens epithelial cells. It is essential to determine the necessary initial concentration of each mitotic inhibitor In the anterior segment compartments. This can be accomplished by realizing the minimal effective dosage of each agent, the lens epithelial cell cycle time, the rate of aqueous humor formation and exit, and the volume of the anterior segment compartments after lens extraction. The initial concentration can then be calculated from an approximated first order linear differential equation describing the aqueous humor dynamics v volume of anterior segment compartments r rate bf aqueous formation assumed to be equal to aqueous exit in steady state C concentration of the drug Co initial concentration Ct concentration at time tThen 0.00357t 4.284 assuming Ct t 1,200 t 1,200 minutes For Methotrexate Ct 10 6M C e 4.284 t C 10 6M e 4.284 10 4M 0.0454 mg cc Retinoic acid Ct 10 6M C e 4.284 10 6M e4.284 10 4M M 0.033 mg cc Colchicine 4.284 1 C 10 6M C e 4.284 6 4 284 6 C0 10 6M M e 4.284 72.5 x10 6M 0.04 0.04 mg cc The carrier solution can be a variety of solutions.

The diluents used are either BSS for MIOSTAT andZOLYSE or sterile sodium chloride solution for CATARASE.Example 1 In this example, extracapsular cataract extraction by phacoemulsification was performed in both eyes of three older primates Macaca fascicularis and three pigmented rabbits Oryctolarls cuniculus . Methotrexate, retinoic acid, and colchicine was instilled above each of their minimal effective dose into the anterior chamber of one eye of each of the primates and pigmented rabbits immediately following cataract surgery, with the other eye of the same primate and rabbit serving as an operate control. To determine the effects of the mitotic inhibitors on the remnant epithelial cells, the rabbits were sacrificed six weeks postoperatively despite te lack of any opacifcations along the posterior capsules in either the control operated or experimental operated plus mitotic inhibitor instillation . The isolated posterior capsules of the control and experimental. animals were processed for electron microscopy and infiltrated in Epon Araldite. Characteristic light and electron micrographs were taken. Consistently with all three mitotic inhibitors, light microscopy revealed a homogeneous population of spindle shaped cells in the angles between the collapsed thick anterior and thin posterior capsules.Uniformly, with all three mitotic inhibitors, any remnAnt lens epithelial cells along the anterior capsules were non mitotic, non pycnotic, and contained contorted interphase nuclei, atrophic mitrochondria, and bloated, irregular rough endoplasmic reticulum. With all three mitotic inhibitors, the spindle cells ultrastructurally were not lens fibers but were transformed arrested lens epithelium that was induced by the mitotic inhibitors to become elongated cells with non pycnotic nuclei, atrophic mitochondria, and irregular rough endoplasmic reticulum. Each primate and rabbit was followed with slitlamp photographs of the posterior lens capsule, endothelial cell counts, and corneal thickness measurements preoperatively, then again at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 8 months postoperatively. Electroretinograms ERGs and visual evoked responses VERs were recorded preoperatively and then at 6 weeks, 4 months and 8 months postoperatively. The most striking clinical result was in the eyes instilled with methotrexate. There was a crystal clear posterior lens capsule in the experimental eyes whereas the posterior lens capsule in the control eyes had been completely opacified by the proliferating lens epithelial cells with early developing Elschnig s pearls. In the eyes instilled with retinoic acid there was a clear central posterior lens capsule with tiny islands of proliferating lens epithelial cells in the far periphery. In the contralateral control eyes there was also a clear central posterior capsule. EIowever, extensive islands of lens epithelial cell proliferation occurred in the mid periphery. The posterior lens capsules in the colchicineinjected eyes were clear centrally with peripherial lens epithelial island however, the control eye showed large islands of epithelial cells with a suggestion of cells breaking through to the posterior clear capsule. From the sequential ERGs, VERs, endothelial cell counts, and corneal thickness measurements, no ocular toxicity was found in the eyes instilled with methotrexate or retinoic acid, but apparent optic nerve toxicity was seen in the eyes instilled with colchicine.Example 2 In this example, extracapsular cataract extraction by phacoemulsification was performed in both eyes of four younger primates approximate human equivalent of 7 10 year old . Methotrexate was instilled in one eye of each of the primates as inExample 1. At two months post operation, 2 of the 4 pbsterior lens capsules from the controlled eyes had opacified while all 4 posterior lens capsules instilled with methotrexate remained clear. From the foregoing examples, and the data obtained, methotrexate and retinoic acid are safe agents to use to prevent posterior lens capsule opacification, with no apparent ocular toxicity or adverse side effects. Colchicine does prevent posterior lens capsule opacification, but apparently there is some optic nerve toxicity associated with its use. The instillation of methotrexate and retinoic acid in the precalculated dosage as set forth above, provide effective methods to prevent posterior lens capsule opacification without ocular compromise after extracapsular cataract extraction, while instillation of colchicine prevents posterior lens capsule opacification but with some optic nerve toxity. The use of these mitotic inhibitors minimizes opacification of an intact posterior lens capsule postoperatively, and thereby greatly reduces the complications of cataract surgery, such as cys to id macular edema, retinal detachment, and the corneovitreous touch syndrome. The present invention, therefore, is well suited and adapted to attain the objects and ends and has the advantages and features mentioned as well as others inherent therein. tvihile presently preferred embodiments have been given for the purpose of disclosure, changes can be made therein which are within the spirit of the invention as defIned by the scope of the appended claims.
