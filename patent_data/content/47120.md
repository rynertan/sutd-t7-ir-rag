# Monomer compositions, polymer concrete compositions containing them and their use.

## Abstract
Monomer compositions comprising dicyclopenteny loxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate and hydroxyalkyl methac rylate are used in polymer concrete compositions which additionally comprise inert inorganic aggregate material and polymerization catalyst comprising peroxide and aromatic amine, optionally with polyvalent metal complex or salt or hydroperoxide and polyvalent metal complex or salt. The polymer concrete may be used to form or patch previously formed or laid concrete floors and road oavements.
