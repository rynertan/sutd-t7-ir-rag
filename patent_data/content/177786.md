## Description
Title of the Invention Anti corrosion treatment process for iron materialsField of the Invention This invention relates to an anti corrosion treatment process for iron materials iron and iron alloys . More particularly, this invention relates to an anti corrosion treatment process for iron materials comprising forming a zinc coating on the surface of an iron material and thereafter treating the coated surface with a non aqueous chromating treatment composition.Background of the Invention It is well known to coat the surface of steel materials with zinc by hot dip plating or electrolytic plating. Rather recently, a method of coating an iron material with zinc has been developed, said method comprising projecting onto the surface of said material a blast material comprising an aggregation of particles each comprised of an iron core and a zinc crust surrounding the iron core with intermediate layers of iron zinc alloys Japanese Laid Open Patent PublicationNo. 45372 81 . This is an improved version of the socalled mechanical plating, which has been known since around 1965 as disclosed in British Patent No. 1,041,620. The method of Japanese Laid Open Patent PublicationNo. 45372 81 comprises projecting onto the surface of an iron material a blast material which is an aggregation of independent particles comprised of a core substantially of iron a crust substantially of zinc which is formed on the surface of the core particle with iron zinc alloy layers between the core and the crust. Here substantially of iron , means the core is pure iron or iron alloy containing a small amount of silicon, manganese, chromium, nickel, etc. and substantially of zinc means pure zinc or zinc alloy containing a small amount of copper, aluminum, magnesium, silicon, tin, etc. The intermediate iron zinc layers are a plurality of layers of different Fe Zn intermetallic compounds. The zinc blast material can be prepared by melt coating or diffusion coating. The proportion of iron and zinc in the blast material is 10 95 by weight of iron to 5 90 by weight of zinc, preferably 10 70 by weight of iron to 90 30 by weight of zinc, more preferably, 15 65 by weight of iron to 85 35 by weight of zinc. A suitable proportion in this range is selected in accordance with the intended use.The particle size is generally under 16 mesh.Blasting can be effected using blast machines of various types including tumbler type, barrel type, etc. The mechanical plating method is advantageous in that equipment cost and energy consumption are low and the environmental pollution factors are much limited. Although the method and material of said JapanesePatent Publication have radically overcome the defects of earlier mechanical plating, zinc coating formed by this method is still insufficient in corrosion resistance and red rust is generated on an iron 2 material coated with zinc at 100 mg dm2 by this method within 24 hours in the salt spray test. It is considered that this is because the formed coating film is of an iron zinc alloy and is porous. Therefore, even by the above mentioned improved mechanical plating method hereinafter referred to as blast zinc plating sufficient corrosion resistance cannot be expected unless it is used in combination with some other suitable method. A rather simple anti corrosion measure is the chromating process, of which there are three types of the baking chromating process, aqueous chromating process and non aqueous chromating process. The baking chromating process comprises coating a surface to be treated with a composition comprising a water soluble chromic acid compound, a reducing agent and water, and baking the coated material to reduce the chromic acid compound so as to form a water insoluble chromate coating film. Hynack ofPennwalt Company, Dacromet 100 of Diamond ShamrockCompany, etc. are well known agents for the process of this type. The formation of a coating film in the baking chromating process is based on reduction of the chromic acid on heating in the presence of a reducing agent, and therefore, the reduction of the chromic acid is effected without fail, even if the substrate is an iron zinc alloy coating formed by the blast zinc plating.However, such treatment is disadvantageous in that a step for removing excessive treating agent adhering to the substrate being treated and steps for drying and baking the green substrate are required and thus it requires higher equipment cost, more extensive plant space, increased number of the process steps, and increased consumption of energy, and as a result the production cost is higher. The aqueous chromating process comprises treating the surface of a galvanized steel material with a mixture of a water soluble chromic acid compound, a strong acid and water. This is an age old well known technique disclosed in several text books such as Mekki Gijutu Binran published by Nikkan Koqyo Sinbunsha, etc. The aqueous chromating treatment is effective for pure zinc, but is not so effective for iron zinc materials as for pure zinc, since the formed film is considerably irregular. The aqueous chromating composition is a mixture of water, a water soluble chromic acid compound and a strong acid such as sulfuric acid, the zinc reacts with the strong acid on the surface being treated to produce nascent hydrogen, which reduces the chromic acid to form a chromate film on the surface.The reaction takes place at the zinc plated surface and therefore, a thick film cannot be easily formed. Also the aqueous chromating solution produces waste liquid containing a large amount of chromic acid and thus the cost of the equipment required for waste liquid disposal and the operation therefor is huge. Therefore, it is not suitable to combine this process with the blast zinc plating, which is free from the problem of disposition of waste liquid. The composition used in the non aqueous chromating process essentially consists of a chromic acid compound, an organic solvent usually halogenated hydrocarbon and an alcohol as a solubilizer, and it may contain a stabilizer and a reaction promotor for formation of chromate film and they are disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 5288 65 Du Pont ,Japanese Patent Publication No. 3363 67 Du Pont , japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 62970 81 Tokuyama Soda ,Japanese Laid Open Patent PublicationNo. 97476 80 Nippon Paint and Japanese Laid OpenPatent Publication No. 139679 81 Nippon Paint .Rather recently, a very stable non aqueous chromating treatment composition containing chlorofluorocarbon as the solvent was invented copending Patent Application No. In the process of this invention, any nonaqueous chromating treatment composition can be used, but it will be advantageous to use a composition in which a chloroflurotarbon solvent is used. We studied various chromating processes to be combined with blast zinc plating and found that a combination with the non aqueous chromating treatment exhibits the best corrosion prevention effect and completed this invention.Summary of the Invention This invention provides a process for treating the surface of iron materials comprising forming a zinc coating layer on the surface of an iron material by projecting a blast material which is an aggregation of particles each comprising a core comprising substantially iron, intermediate layers of iron zinc alloys and an outer crust substantially comprising zinc and treating the thus zinc coated surface with a non aqueous chromating composition comprising a chromic acid compound, halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, an alcohol solubilizer. The process of this invention compensates for the insufficiency in the corrosion prevention effect of blast zinc plating without impairing its advantage.Specific Description of the Invention The blast zinc plating employed in this invention is described in detail in the above mentioned JapaneseLaid Open Patent Publication No. 45372 81. However, an outline of the pertinent portions thereof is set out in the following. The iron particles for the cores of the blast material of this invention can be manufactured by any known method such as the carbon reduction process, gas reduction process, atomizing method, mechanical pulverization process, etc. It is desirable to modify the shape and properties thereof by cold working and or heat treatment in accordance with the treatments which the particles have undergone.That is to say, the particles should be made as round as possible, the surface layer is hardened by cold working, so as to obtain iron particles having excellent abrasion resistance and impact resistance.Further, the toughness of the iron particles can preferably be improved by alloying some of the abovementioned elements. Such improvement in the toughness of the core iron particles contributes to prevention of fracture of the blast material having zinc crust, although fracture of the blast material is not practically observed. Metallic zinc is rather brittle. Therefore, it is preferred that the zinc for forming the zinc crust of the blast material contains 3 5 aluminum and or 0.2 1 copper. The impact resistance of the blast material is improved by alloying such elements. The blast material having an alloy crust is prepared by the melt coating process. The blast material having a neat zinc crust can also be prepared by the diffusion process.The diffusion process comprises heating a mixture of iron particles and zinc powder. Specifically, neat iron or alloyed iron particles are mixed with zinc powder, preferably further with 0.5 3 on the basis of the metals of ammonium halide, preferably chloride added, in a container of iron or silicon carbide, at a temperature in the range of 400 7000C for 3 20 minutes so as to form zinc iron alloy layers and a zinc crust around the iron cores.This process can be carried out by a batch wise or continuously. When it is continuously carried out by feeding iron powder into an auger type or a pusher type externally heated furnace. The resulting material is made into zinc crusted iron particles by simple crushing treatment. The thus obtained blast material is substantially the same as obtained by the melt coating process. The organic solvent used in the non aqueous chromating treatment is a halogenated hydrocarbon this term encompasses chlorofluerocarbon having 1 2 carbon atoms and chlorine and or fluorine atoms as well as possible remaining hydrogens. That is, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, trichlorotrifluoroethane, trichloromonofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, tetrachlorodifluoroethane, etc. and mixtures thereof can be suitably used.The factors to be considered in selecting solvent is that the solvent is homogeneously miscible with other components of the composition, it is in the liquid state at the temperature at which the chromating reaction proceeds at a significant reaction rate, etc. Chromic acid used in this invention is what is called chromic acid anhydride or chromium trioxide having a chemical formula CrO3. Said chromic acid anhydride is used in an amount of 0.01 10 parts preferably 0.1 8 parts, more preferably 0.2 5 parts by weight hereinafter referred to simply as parts per 100 parts of the halogenated hydrocarbon solvent.With an amount less than 0.01 part,.the chromating reaction proceeds very slowly and with the amount in excess of 10 parts, decomposition of the used halogenated hydrocarbon solvent and solubilizer is accelerated and invites formation of incomplete coating and abatement of anti corrosion effect. The solubilizer used in this invention is a secondary or tertiary alcohol having 3 20 carbon atoms which is soluble in said halogenated hydrocarbon solvent. Generally, secondary propanol, tertiary butanol, tertiary amyl alcohol, triphenyl carbinol, etc. can be suitably used. Tertiary butanol hereinafter referred to as t butanol is most suitable because it dissolves homogeneously in most of the compositions of this invention, is stable over a long period and is inexpensive.At least 1 part of the solubilizer per 100 parts of the halogenated hydrocarbon solvent is required, and 20 parts or larger amount can be used. As an increased amount of the solubilizer is used, an increased amount of chromic acid anhydride can be dissolved. With less than 1 part of the solubilizer, solubilization in not sufficient. More than 20 parts thereof can be used, but it may make the composition inflammable according to the use condition. Therefore up to 20 parts will be preferably used. The more preferred range is 2 10 parts. The stabilizer used in this invention can be selected from a wide range of known compounds such as amines, quinones, nitro , azo , azoxyaromatic compounds, thiourea, dienesorganic nitrite salt, zinc fluoride, zinc oxide, etc. The stabilizer is unnecessary when chlorofluorocarbon is used as the solvent, and therefore, chlorofluorocarbon is preferred.Examples of the stabilizer are N nitrodiphenylamine, azoxybenzene, hydroquinone, diisobutylamine, pentadiene, amyl nitrite, etc. These compounds can be used singly or in combination, and are used in an amount 0.001 5 parts per 100 parts of the halogenated hydrocarbon solvent. Outside of this range, little or no effect is expected or no correspondingly better effect is expected. The preferred range is 0.05 3 parts and the more preferred range is 0.1 2 parts. The reaction promotor used in the process of this invention is hydrogen fluoride, an organic acid, water, etc. This component is not essential and can be omitted from the composition depending upon. the condition.An organic acid having 1 20 carbon atoms can be used.Preferably an organic acid having a general formulaR COOH n, wherein R is may be a straight chained, branched or cyclic hydrocarbyl group, and may be substituted, and n is an integer of 1 3. Examples of these organic acid are formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, stearic acid, oxalic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, etc. and mixtures of thereof. These reaction promotors can suitably be used in an amount 0.001 10 parts, preferably 0.003 1 part, and more preferably 0.005 0.5 part per 100 parts of the halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, and hydrogen fluoride and organic acids are preferably in an amount of not more than preferably 0.12 part, Water should preferably be used within the limit that it dissolves homogeneously in the system. Under the lower limit, the effect as a reaction promotor is not expected, and above the upper limit, corrosion effect thereof on the materials or articles to be treated and the apparatus becomes manifested or the homogenity of the system, is impaired. The preferred content of the reaction promotor is 0.005 0.12 part. The chromating treatment composition used in the process of this invention is substantially non aqueous, and the halogenated hydrocarbon solvent acts as a degreaser as well as makes the system nonflammable the solubilizer renders all the ingredients to dissolve homogeneously in the system. It is essential that all the ingredients dissolve homogeneously in the system. If not, the resulting coating is non uniform and does not bring about satisfactory anti corrosion effect. The procedure of the chromating treatment is as follows. The chromating treatment composition is kept at a temperature between 50C and the boiling point and metal articles to be treated are contacted therewith for 1 second 60 minutes, preferably for 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Thereafter, the metal surface is dried. When the temperature of the composition is lower than 50C, the chromating reaction does not substantially proceed and when the contact time is shorter than 1 second, substantially effective coating is not obtained and when it is longer 60 minutes, non uniform coating is sometimes formed which is not desirable because of poor appearance. Iron materials to be treated should preferably be degreased beforehand. However, not too large amount of oils on the surface thereof can be removed during the chromating treatment. It is of course possible to improve the anticorrosion performance by heating or irradiating ultraviolet rays after the treatment. As has been described above, the process of this invention is substantially non aqueous all through the process, and no measures for waste liquid disposal are required. Thus excellent anti corrosion coating can be formed very economically. When the product obtained by the process of this invention I , those obtained by the hot dip zinc plating process II and the product obtained by treating hot dip zinc plated material by the nonaqueous chromating treatment composition III are compared, product III is best in corrosion resistance, product I comes second and product II is inferior.But the cost for preparing product III is three times that of I . Corrosion resistance of product 11 is sufficient for ordinary uses. Thus it can be said that product III is of excessively superior quality.Specific Description of Embodiments of the Invention Now the invention will be explained in detail by way of working examples and comparative examples.However, the invention is by no means limited to such working examples.Example 1 melt coating of iron particles Iron particles smaller than 16 mesh were filled in a cylindrical container of silicon carbide, and annealed using a tunnel kiln furnace at 9200C with a residence time of 6 hours.

The mixture was filled in a cylindrical container of iron and placed in a heating furnace heated at 6500C, by which a reaction temperature of 5500C was rapidly achieved in the container, and the container was kept in the furnace for five minutes.Thereafter the container was cooled in the atmosphere and the resulting crusted particles were taken out.In this case, although zinc is heated higher than its melting point, iron particles and zinc do not coagulate prevented by the oxide film existing on the surface of the zinc powder Therefore, no crushing is required.
