# Improvements in or relating to the production of tubular members.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an arrangement for forming an elbow in a length of pipe comprising two internal die pins 1,2 each mounted for rotation, as limbs of cranked assemblies, about the same axis 8 , the internal die pins being angled with respect to the axis of rotation and meeting each other in surfaces 9,10 lying in a plane normal to the axis of rotation, the surfaces being intersected by said axis of rotation means for contra rotating the cranked assemblies from a position at which the die pins are co axial to a position at which they are aligned at a pre determined angle with respect to each other.
