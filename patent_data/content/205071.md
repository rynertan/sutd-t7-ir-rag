## Description
GENES INVOLVED WITH HYDROGENASE AND NITROGENASE ACTIVITIES IN RHIZOBIUM JAPONICUM EMI1.1 CONTAINING SAME Background of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to nitrogen fixa tion by leguminous plants. More particularly, it relates to those genes involved in nitrogen fixation and the oxidation of hydrogen producedEMI1.2 by product of nitrogen fixation.2. Descri tfon of the Prior Art The process of biological nitrogen fixation consists of the reduction of elementary nitrogen to ammonia by living organisms. This biologically fixed nitrogren is the major source of nitrogen available for the formation of protein, which ts essential in maintaining the world food supply. The economic importance of biological nitrogen fixation on the Earth cannot be over emphasized. It has been reported that nitrogen fixation by all biological organisms accounts for 90 percent of the nitrogen fixed on Earth per year.Leguminous and non leguminous symbionts alone account for about 5.5 million tons of nitrogen fixed per year in the United States. About 13tO00 species of leguminous plants exist, the vast majority of which are involved in a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen fixing bacteria,Some of the economically more important legumes include soybean, peas, clover and the like. As a result of increased world population there has been increased activity in enhancement of world food sources. One food crop which in recent years has received ever increasing emphasis is soybean because of its high protein content.Much of the enhanced protein content of soybean results from the superior nitrogen fixing capabilities ofRhizobium japonicum the nitrogen fixing bacteria associated with soybean. Nitrogen fixation in R. aponicum is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrogenase. Nitrogenase catayses both the ATP dependent reduction of N2 to NH4 and protons to H2. The evolution of H2 by the nitrogenase reaction is a substantial energy loss during nitrogen fixation Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci. USA 73t1207 1211, c1976 .Some strains of R. japonicum express a membrane bound H2 uptake hydrogenase system as bacteriods in soybean nodules Arch fur Mikrobiol 85 193 201, 1972 . In 1972, Dixon proposed that theH2 uptake mZy be used to i reoxidize the H2 evolved from nitrogenase for additional ATP and reductant for nitrogen fixation, ii utilize the excess O2 to protect the oxygen imbile nitrogenase, and iii prevent the H2 inhibition of nitrogenase Arch fur Mikrobiol 85 193 201, c1972 . In both greenhouse and field studies, soybean plants inoculated with R. japonicumHup strains have been shown to possess increased plant dry matter and increased amounts of nitrogen in seeds as compared to the plants inoculated with R. japonicum Hup strains Agronomy Jour. 73 369 372, c1981 and 72 555 559, c1980 . The R. japonicum strains which possess an H2 uptake capability in bacteriods can also utilize H2 in free living culture when growing chemoautotrophically under microaerophilic conditions Proc. Natl. Acad. SciUSA 76 1788 1792, c1979 J. Bacteriol. 141 664 670, c1980 . Chemoautorophic growth conditions have been exploited to isolate numerous R. japonicum hydrogenuptake Hup negative mutants J. Bacteriol.146 614 620, c1981 and 145 533 540, c1981 . Biochemical and physiological characterization of some of these Hup mutants have helped to elucidate the components involved in H2 uptake, and also how the system is regulated.Hydrogen oxidation activity is reconstitued when cellfree extracts from two different R. japonicum Hup mutants are combined J. Biol. Chem. 257 2092 2096, c1982 . Other mutants have H2 uptake systems that are hypersensitive to repression by carbon substrates and 2 J. Bacteriol. 150 101 167, c1982 . One of the most interesting classes of mutants are those which are defective in both nitrogenase Ni nE hydrogenase Hup activities. Nif Hup mutant strain R139 lacked activity for hydrogenase and both of the nitrogenase component proteins. However, reversion studies indicated that strain SR139 has only a single lesion which affected both nitrogenase and hydrogenase J. Bacteriol.155 926 929, c1983 . Furthermore, tRis mutant strain produced nodules containing normal levels of leghemoglo bin, and had, a growth rate in free living cultures like that of the parent strain. These results indicate the lesion is specific for the symbiotic properties of if and Hup. The isolation of Nif Hup mutants indicate that common biochemical and or genetic components are involved in both nitrogen fixation and hydrogen oxidation. Studies on the organization of genes responsible for H2 oxidation in Rc japonicum have been int tiated. Cantrell et. al. Proc. Natl. Acad. USA 80 181 185, c1983 have used an Ro Japonicum gene bank to isolate a H2 uptake gene hup by complementation of an uncharacterized Hup mutant. When several hup gene cosmids were transferred by conjugation into a differentHup mutant, Hup transconjugants appeared at a low frequency. These results show that the cosmid may contain one hup gene and a part of another. Recently, Huagland et. al. J.Bacteriol. 159 1006 1017, c1984 have reported that some hup genes of R. iasonicum DES122 are linked in one area of its chromosomes, and organized in a minimum of two transcriptional units, They showed that approximately 15 kb of DNA of cosmid pHUl are encoded for hup genes. H2 is oxidized by the hydrogenase enzyme andCO2 is fixed by a RuBP carboxylase Lepo, J. E,I Hanus, F.J., and Evans, H. J., J. Bacteriol 141 664 670, c1980 . Strains which possess such chemolithotrophic capacity may have an increased chance of survival in the soil where there is a limitation of fixed carbon substrates. Highly active hydrogen oxidi2ing systems have been found only in about 25 of R. japonicum strains and in no strain of R. trifolii or R. meliloti Evans, H. Je, Purohit, K., Cantrell, M. A., Eisbrenner, G.,Russell, S. A., Hanus, F. J., Lepo, J. E., Current Perspectiveo in Nitrogen Fixation, eds. Gibson, A. H. BR Newton, W. E. Elsevier North Holland, New Yorki NY 84 96 , Most strains of R. leguminosarum are Hup and with a few exceptions the Hup strains of this species recycle only A small proportion of the H2 produced by the nitrogenase reaction Nelson, L. M. and Salminen, S. O., J. Bacteriol. 151 989 995, c1982 . It would be beneficial if Hup strains of any one of the several species of Rhizobium could be modified to Hup , e.g. by a transfer of the genes for the Hup prototype from highly active Hup strains. Beneficial effects of the transfer of genes for the Hup phenotype could include not only the ability to utilize H2 per se but also the ability to grow chemolithotrophically. At least some of the determinants for the Hup phenotype have been shown to be plasmid borne and transmissible in Alcaligenes eutrophus Friedrich, B.,Hogrefe, C., Schlegel, H. G., J. Bacteriol. 147 198 205, c1981 and in R. leguminosarum Brewen, N. 3., DeJong, T. M., Phillips, D. A. and Johnston, A. W.B., Nature 288 77 79, c1980 . In both R. leguminosarum and A. eutrophus, the Hup phenotype was carried on large, naturally occurring plasmids which must carry many other genes. The plasmid carrying Hup determinants in R. leguminosarum also was shown to carry determinants for nodulation specificity and for N2 fixation. The host range for this plasmid may be limited Brewen, N.J., DeJong, T. M., Phillips, D. A. Johnston, A. W. B.Nature 28 77 79, c1980 , and recipients of this plasmid may only be able to form effective nodules on pea plants. Techniques for measurement of H2 uptake have been described Hanus, F. J., Carter, K. R. Evans, H. J., Methods Enzomol. 69s731 739, cm980 , Bethienfalvay, G. 3. Phillips, D. A., Plant Physiol. 63 816 820, c1979 . Colonies of Azotobacter chroococcum have been screened for expression of hydrogenase activity by observations of differences in rates of reduction of methylene blue by Hup and Hup Azotobacter colonies Postgate, J. R., Partridge, C. D. P., Robson, .R. L.,Simpson, F. G., Yates, M. G., J. Gen. Microbiol. 128 905 908, c1982 . But none of these methods relates to the isolation of Hup Rhizobium colonies from a large number of putative recipients.

Media and Growth Conditions Rhizobium japonicum was routinely grown in either the mannitol yeast extract MYS medium described by Lim and Shanmugam Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 584 479 492,.c1979 or the yeast extract medium YE described by Hom et. al. LB medium was used as described by Miller to cultivate E. coli 3. Bacteriol. 145 533 540, c1981 . Since Stults and co workers have recently shown that nickel is an integral component of hydrogenase in R. japonicum SR J. Bacteriol.159 153 158, c1984 , BM no carbon medium was supple mented with 5r lm m NiC12. After inoculation, agar plates 1.5 Noble agar were placed in gas tight 20 liter capacity polyethylene buckets. The container was first sparged with N2 and then with a gas mixture consisting of 10 H2, 5 CO2, 1 02, And 84 N2. The buckets were incubated at 300C for 7 14 days and resparged with the gas mixture every 2 days. B. Bacterial Filter Mating Technique Late log phase E. coli donor cells and mid log phase R. japonicum recipient cells 109 each were mixed together, collected onto a metrical membrane filter 25 mm diameter, 0.454m m pore size Gelman Instrument Co., Ann Arbor, Mich. , and incubated on YE agar plates at 300C for 5 days. The cells were then resuspended in 5 ml of Tween 40 10.01 vol vol l, serially diluted, and aliquots were spread onto the appropriate selection plates. The plates were incubated at 300C for 7 14 days.The titer of recipients at the time of plating onto the selective medium was determined by spreading aliquots onto mannitol glutamate agar plates, and incubated at 30 C for 7 days. C. Determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration MIC The MIC is defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration at which no colonies appeared. Mid log phase R. japonicum cells were cultivated and aliquots containing 100 300 cells were spread onto MYS agar plates containing increased levels of tetracycline as described J. Bacteriol. 159 335 340 c1984 . D. Hydrogen Uptake Induct ion and Assay H2 uptake activity of free living cultures of R. japonicum was measured by the induction procedure ofMaier J. Bacteriol. 145 533 540, c1981 with minor modifications. After growth in YE supplemented with 50 g ml tetracycline when tranconjugants were cultured to an OD540 of 0.5 0.7, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 1500 x y710 min at room temperature and resuspended in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 2.5 mM MgC12. Then 10 ml of cells OD540 of 0.5 were dispensed into 160 ml serum bottles No.223748 Wheaton, Millerville, NJ . Serum bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers 13 x 20 mm fitted with aluminum collars, and then sparged with 10 H2, 5 Co21 And 84 N2. The bottles were incubated at 300C for 48 hours on a rotary shaker 100 rpm Model G 24, New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ . H2 uptake specific activities were measured amperometrically as described 20, 30 except that the amperometric chamber size was 4.5 ml. Cell numbers were estimated by utilizing a standard curve of colony forming units versus optical density at 540 nm. E. Soybean Nodulation and Nitroyenase Assays Rhizobium japonicum strains were checked for effectiveness nitrogen fixation with Essex soybean Glycine Max, L. Merr . Seeds were surface sterilized by immersicn first with 95 ethanol and then with 0.2 HgClzt rinsed 10 times with sterile distilled H2O and incubated in the dark for 4 days at 300C on the surface of 1 water agar plates, as described by Vincent Vincent, J. M. ZA manual for the practical study of root nodule, bacteria. International Biological Proyram, Blackwell Scientific Publications. Oxford, England.1970 . Rhizodum laponicum cultures for seed inoculation were grow in MSY medium as described previously J. Bacteriol. 159t335 340, c1984 . This medium for growing transconjugants was supplemented with 50 4 g ml tetracycline. Germinated soybean seeds were inoculated with 109 Rhizobium japonicum cells. Soybean plants were grown for 6 weeks by the pouch method as described Science 201 448 450, c1978 . Uninoculated control plants did not form nodules. Nitrogenase activities were measured by placing root sections containing nodules into a 160 ml serum bottle. After sealing the bottles with rubber stoppers fitted with aluminum collars, acetylene was added to a final concentration of 108 vol vol . After incubating for 30 minutes at room temperature, acetylene reduction ethylene formation was determined by gas chromatography as described J. Bacteriol. 159 335 340, c1984 . Acetylene reduction activity was linear through this time period. Rhizobium zaponicum strains responsible for infection were reisolated from nodules by the nodule surface sterilization procedure of Vincent, which utilized 95 ethanol and 3 hydrogen peroxide. Nodules were crushed onto MSY agar plates containing 60 y ml tetracycline. These agar plates were incubated at 300C for 10 days. F. Nitrogenase Induct ion and Assay Nitrogenase activity in free living cultures ofR. aponicum was induced by the procedure of Ayarwal andKeister Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 45 1592 1601, c1983 .Tetracycline 509 g ml was included in the induction culture of R. aponicum transconjugants. Prescription bottles 250 ml vol were used instead of 500 ml reayent bottles. Acetylene 10 vol vol was added at the beyinning of the incubation period. Nitroyenase activities and estimation of cell numbers were measured as described in the previous section. G. Cosmid DNA Isolation and Bacterial Transformations Cosmid DNA from SR139 transconjugants was iso lated as described by Kado and Lui 13 , with modifications. Rhizobium japonicum transconjugants were grown in YE 50g.ml tetracycline to late log phase, washed twice with 40 mM Tris acetate containing 2 mM EDTA pH 7.9 E buffer plus 3 NaCl wt vol , and once with E buffer minus 3 NaCI to remove the exopolysacharides.The final cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml E buffer, and the cells were lysed with 1.0 ml of 39 SDS wt vol inE buffer pH 12.6. After incubation at 650C for 1 h, the preparation was extracted with 1.5 ml of unbuffered phenol chloroform 1 1 and centrifuyed at 8000 xg for 15 min. The DNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated by adding 1 10 vol of 2.5 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 2 vol of cold ethanol. After incubation at 20 C overnight, the DNA was harvested by centrifuyation for 15 min in a microfuge at 40C. After drying the DNA pellet, the DNA was resuspended in 6 mM Tris, 0.1 mMEDTA, 10 mM NaCl pH 7.4. Competent E. coli HB101 cells were prepared by the procedure of Maniatis Maniatis, T., E. F. Fri ach, and J. Sambrook. Molecular cloning a laboratory manual . Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold SpringHarbor, NY. 1982. III. Results A. Complementation of an R. 3aponicum Nif Hup Mutant with an R. japonicum Gene Bank The Nif Hup mutant, strain SR139, was con Jugated with the pLAFRl cosmid clone library. Rhizobium japonicum colonies able to yrow autotrophically Aut with hydrogen and carbon dioxide as sole energy and carbon source were selected. In filter matings between E.coli donors containg the R. japonicum 1 110 clone bank and SR139 recipients, the frequency of Aut colonies per recipient 3.2 x 10 6 was two times yreater than that of spontaneous SR139 Aut revertants 1.6 x 10 6 . TheAut strains were isolated and then screened for growth on MSY agar plates containing tetracycline 60 H g ml Out of 156 Aut colonies tested, twenty seven tetra cycl1ne resistant TCr strains were isolated. Three randomly chosen Aut Tcr strains SR139 pSH7 , SR139 tpSH14 , SR139 pSH20 1 possessed substantially increased tetracycline resistance compared to SR139. The single cell minimum inhibitory concentration MIC for tetracycline for these three strains was 150 g ml, which was at least three times greater than that of the SR139 parent strain 45 q g ml . Moreover, all Tcr Autl isolates possessed the stretomycin and kanamycin resistances of the SR139 parent. These results suggest that the Tcr Aut strains are SR139 transconjugants that harbor a clone containing gene which complemented the Hup phenotype. B. Hydrogen Uptake and Nitroyenase Activities in Putative SR139 Transconjugants Reversion analysis of strain SR139 had previously shown that the genetic defect which resulted in the Hup Nif phenotype was a single mutation J.Bacteriol. 155 926 929, c1983 . SR139 revertants able to grow autotrophically were shown to possess both hydroyen uptake and symbiotic nitroyenase activities.To further established positive complementation of both defects of SR139, oxygen dependent H2 uptake activities were measured amperometrically on whole cells of SR139Tcr Aut transconjugates. The results are set forth in the following Table II. TABLE II Hydrogen Oxidation Activities of SR139 Transconjugants Hydrogen uptake ActivityaStrain nmol H2 oxidized h 148 cells SR 136SR139 0SR139 0SR139 201 SR139 156SR139 102SR139 45SR139 78SR139 53SR139 84SR139 158SR139 76 SR139 82SR139 83SR139 62SR139 112SR139 93SR139 153SR139 45SR139 68SR139 126SR139 76SR139 84SR139 11G SR139 79 SR139 91 SR139 69SR139 131 a Cells were grown, harvested, resuspended in 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, and depressed for 48 h in an atmosphere containing 84 N2, 10 H2, 5 CO2, and 1 02 as described in the methods section.Oxygen dependent hydrogen uptake specific activities were determined amperometrically as described in the methods sections. As is apparent from Table II, all transcon mutants possessed high levels of H2 uptake specific activities. That the various transconjugants containH2 uptake activities that range from 30 to 1501 of wild type should not be seen as unusual because variability in H2 oxidation rates even in a single strain after depression has been previously observed. Secondly, nitrogenase activities acetylene reduction assays were measured on root sections containing nodules from soybean plants that had been inoculated with s i,x transconjugates. These six transconjugÅants were chosen for analyses because casmido that were isolated from item complemented strain SR139 at a requency of 1.0. The results are as set forth in the following Table III. TABLE IIISymbiotic Nitrogenase Activities of SR139 Transconjuyants Hydroyen uptake ActivityaStrain umole C2H2 reduced h gmn fresh nodule wt SR 17.8 SR139 0 SR139 pLAFR1 O SR139 pSH1S 0.59 SR139 pSH16 1.02SR139 pSH17 0.52 SR139 pSHl9 1.06SR139 pSH22 0.50SR139 pSH26 0.22 a Six week old soybean plants were harvested and nodu les on root sections were assayed for acetylene reduction as described in the methods section. As is apparent from Table III modules from plants rnocu I lated with the transconjugates possessed nitrogenase specific activities approximately 1 69 of that for the wild type SR strain. On the other hand, nodules from plants inoculated with SR139 or SR139 tpLAFRl did not have nitrogenase activity.Tetracycline resistant Hup strains have been reisolated from nodules from soybean plants that had been inoculated with these R. japonicum transconjugates. C. Analysis of Cosmids Containing the Nif Hup Gene Cosmid DNA from fifteen SR139 transconjugants was isolated and transferred to E. coli HBlUl by transformation. There cosmids were generally designated pSH.A representative example of these cosmids pSH 22 is obtainable from Escherichia coli HB101, NRRL numberB 15906. This biologically pure culture is available from the permanent collection of the Northern RegionalResearch Laboratories, Agricultural Research Services,US Department of Ayricultural under the above accession number, Peoria, Illinois, USA. The permanancy of the deposit of the culture, and ready accessbility thereto by public are afforded throughout the effective life of the patent in the event the patent is granted. Access to the culture is available during the pendency of the application under 37 CFR1.14 and 35 USCSll2. All restrictions on the availability to the public of the deposited culture will be irrevocably removed upon granting a patent.The nif hup cosmids are unique because they contain a nif hup gene that is involved in bothtnitro enase andhydroyenase activities. The specific vector DNA used pLaFRl is not itself new. Other vector DNA may be similarly usable so lony as it can be easily introduced or maintained R. laponicum and a bacterium such as E. coli commonly used in yenetics laboratories. The hup DNA and nif DNA contained in the cosmid is the insert DNA which produces the Hup and Nif character. The hup nif DNA may come from any organism which contains hup and nif genes, but preferably is served from R. japonicum.The characteristics of the rut nif DNA listed below should not be construed as iimiting, nor need the functional characteristic be specifically associated, with DNA fragments having the molecular sizes listed in Table IV. Cosmid DNA from the HB101 transformants was digested with restriction endonuclease EcoRl and DNA restriction fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Using conventional techniques, the restriction pattern resulting from the ge electrophoresis for each of the transcon mutants resulted in a number of common DNA fragments, the approximate molecular size of which in kilobase pairs are set, forth in the following Table IV. TABLE IV Frayment Molecular size kb 1 21.6 2 13.2 3 4.0 5 3.0 6 2.5 The 21.6 kilobase fragment which co migrated with the linearized PLAFR1 vector was derived from the vector, and therefore is not a fragment of hup DNA or nif DNA. The DNA used as the source of the hup nif DNA was orignally digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI.Accordingly the hup and nif DNA can be easily cleaved from the vector, PLAFR1, by partial digestions withEcoRI using procedures well known in the art. The isolated hup and nif DNA can be joined with different vectors and used to insert such hup and nif DNA into otherHup and or Nif bacteria species also using conventional vectors and methods to. To show the presence of the nif hup gene in cosmid clones, randomly chosen representatives cosmids, having the restriction pattern of Table IV, were transferred via conjugation from E. coli HB101 SR139 HupNif using conventional conjugation techniques as for example those described inEMI19.1 and evaluatea tor their ability to grow under autotrophic conditions using the procedures described inEMI19.2 The results of these eva lotions are set forth in the following Table V.

Randomly selected Tcr Hup SR139 transcon mutants from each mating were evaluated to determine whether they possessed whole cell ex planta nitrogen nase activity. The procedure employed is described inEMI19.3 The results of these studies are set forth in the following Table VI.

Transfer of a Cosmid containing the Nif Hup Gene into Other R. japonicum Hup Mutants Since the nif hup gene cosmid possessed an insert of approximately 23 kb, there existed the possibility that other genes involved in the expression of hydrogenase were encoded on this recombinant cosmid. A series of experiments were conducted to determine the nature of the genes on the insert. In these experiments, representative cosmid pSH22, which complemented NifHup SR139 was transferred by conjugation from E. coliHB101 to fifteen other Hup mutants using the proceduresEMI20.1 dies, the nature of the defect causing a hup phenotype was shown to differ amongst the various Hup mutants.Tetracycline resistant transconjugants were isolated using the procedureEMI21.1 ahd then screened for their H2 uptake capability by their growth response under autotrophic conditions using the procedure ofEMI21.2 The results are set forth in Table VII.

All of these mutants are Hup but Nif . The results show that the nif hup cosmid pSH22 as well as other cosmids having the restriction pattern on Table IV contains at least one and perhaps other hup genes which are involved in H2 uptake activity exclusively. When nif hup cosmid pSH22 was transferred to 15 R. japonicum Hup Nif mutants.Hup transconjugants were detected at a frequency of 1.0 per cosmid transfer for mutant strains 5R114, SR11B, Sill9, 5Rl40, SRl46, and 5U306 47. These six Hup Nif mutants do not possess any whole cell H2 uptake activity when oxygen or methylene blue is used as the electron acceptor Maier, R. J, J. Bacteroil 145 533 540 1981 , Moreover, the hydrogenase polypeptides which were detected in bacteroid extracts of the wild type after two dimensional protein polyacrylamide gel analysis were not detected in any of these six mutnats E. B.O Hara,Ph.D. thesis, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD., 1984 . On the other hand, some of the R. japonicum mutants that were not complemented by nif hup cosmid pSH22 possessed different characteristics, For example, unlike strain SR139, strain SR143 was a Nif Hup mutant that was deficient in the production of heme Moshers, F. L., et.a., J. Bacteriol 155 926 929 1983 . Therefore, the lesion in this mutant is not directly related to nif or hup. Another Hup mutant that was not complemented by the nif hup cosmid pSH22 was strain So166, Strain SR166 lacked whole cell H2 uptake activity when it was coupled to oxygen, and this Hup mutant possessed Hup activity when methylene blue or phenazine methosulfate was used as an electron acceptor Maier, R. J. Ibid . Strain SR166 apparently retains a functional hydrogenase, but it may lack an electron transport component s operating betwen hydrogenase and the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen Maier, R. J. Ibid . Another mutant not complemented by the nif hup cosmid was strain SR122. StrainSR122 is Hup , but it is Aut due to a deficiency in ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity Maier, R. J. ibid . Finally, some other, uncharacterized Hup strains were not complemented. These results suggest that other distinct genetic determinants for the simultaneous expression of nitrogenase and hydroyenase activities, electron transport components for H2 oxidation, carbon dioxide fixation, and H2 uptake are not on nif hup cosmid pSH22. These genetic determinants may be located on the DNA sequences adjacent to the ends of the n hup DNA insertion or may be unlinked. The successful completion of two types of R. japonicum mutants i.e., Nif Hup and Hup . suggests that nif hup recombinant cosmids such as pSH22 may contain a cluster of genes involved in H2 uptake activity and at least one gene also involved with both of the nitrogenase components proteins.
