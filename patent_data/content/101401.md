# Apparatus and method for roof flashing.

## Abstract
Apparatus for flashing rooves, particularly inclined rooves, around vent pipes or the like using a relatively thin sheet of material to surround the pipe 10 and form part of the roof. The apparatus comprises an inner sleeve member 12 adapted to fit over the pipe 10 and pass through a hole in said sheet which accommodates the pipe. The sleeve 17 has an inclined flange 13 which bears on the underside of said sheet 11 . A further similar sleeve 16 is adapted to fit over the inner sleeve 12 . The outer sleeve 16 has a flange 17 which bears on the upper surface of the sheet 11 and a locking cap 18 threadably engages the upper end of said inner sleeve 12 in a manner forcing the outer sleeve 16 downwardly such that the two flanges 13, 17 clamp the sheet therebetween. An annular rubber washer is provided for insertion between the flange 17 and the sheet 11 to form a weather seal and a neoprene weather apron 19 is provided to slide over the pipe 10 in resilient engagement therewith to provide weather protection over said locking cap 19 . The apparatus avoids the need for using relatively thick lead sheets in roof flashing and so saves time in installation.
