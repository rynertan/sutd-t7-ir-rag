# Crystalline zeolite catalysis.

## Abstract
Crystalline zeolite catalysts are stabilized against reducing and moisture containing atmospheres by provid ing and maintaining substantial metal cationic sites in the zeolite during use in chemical reactions encountering reducing and or moisture rich atmospheres at high temp erature.
