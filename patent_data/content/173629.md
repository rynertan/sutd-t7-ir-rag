FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the general area of antibody systems capable of delivering metal ions to target sites in vivo or in vitro.For embodiments in which the metal ions are radioisotopes or another detectible ion, the antibody systems are capable of being identified and or detected owing to the radioisotope or other detectible ion attached to the antibody. More particularly, the invention is directed to water soluble antibody metal ion complexes comprising metal ions attached by coordinate bonding via a compatible chelator to an antibody molecule which substantially retains the immunospecificity and immunoreactivity of the original antibody. The invention also relates to several methods for preparing such antibodymetal ion complexes as well as antibody chelator conjugates which are useful in preparing such complexes. The antibody metal ion complexes of the invention may be used in a variety of in vitro or in vivo applications involving detection or delivery of a labeled antibody or a metal ion, including, but not limited to, immunological assays, imaging of specific tissues and delivery of metal ions and or radioisotopes to specific tissue sites. 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A number of agents have been utilized as carrier molecules with limited success in imaging systems. In practice the carrier should be non toxic and target site specific. Ideally there should be a mechanism for maintenance of the detectable compound or agent at the target site. Radiopharmaceutical techniques currently used in non invasive in vivo imaging methods are based upon the ability of the target organ to remove the radiopharmaceutical label from the circulation. These techniques utilize various substances to deliver radioactive compounds to desired target such substances include substrates, substrate analogs, ligands, hormones, radionuclides, bifunctional chelates linker groups containing a chelator at one end which is able to bind a heavy metal or radioisotope and a reactive group at the other end which can covalently attach to a target cell and liposomes Eckelman andLevanson, 1977, Intl. J. Appl. Radiat. Isot. 28 67 82 . Other non invasive techniques currently available are emission tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and in vitro spectroscopy. A method employing isothiocyanate as a coupling agent has been used to attach fluorescent compounds to antibody molecules for use in fluorescence microscopy Brandtzaeg, 1973, Scand. J. Immunol. 2 273 290 . 2.1. RADIOIMMUNOIMAGING USING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES Monoclonal antibodies produced by the hybridoma technique of Kohler and Milstein 1975, Nature 256 495 497 1976, Eur. J. Immunol. 6 511 519 or related techniques provide distinct advantages for use as carriers for imaging systems. First, monoclonal antibodies bind to only one molecular site i.e., an epitope with specific binding constants. Second, such antibodies are homogeneous and thus are purified with relative ease. Third, monoclonal antibodies can be made in large quantities by particular hybridoma cell lines. The discovery of tumor produced or tumor associated antigens has allowed the preparation of monoclonal antibodies which are immune specific for solid tumors such as human colon, breast, heptatoma, melanoma and germ cell tumors see reviews by Carrasquillo, et al., 1984, Cancer TreatmentRepts. 68 317 328 Kennel, et al., 1984, Bio. Sci. 34 150156 . Methods have been developed for detecting and locating tumors utilizing antibodies or antibody fragments specific for a variety of categories of tumor associated antigens, including oncofetal antigens, placental antigens, oncogenic or tumor virus associated antigens, tissue associated antigens, organ associated antigens, ecotopic hormones, normal antigens and variants thereof.For example,Goldenberg, et al. have demonstrated clinical detection of tumors in human patients using 131I radiolabeled antibody specific for carcinoembryonic antigen 1978, New Eng. J. Med.298 1384 1388 see also disclosures in United States PatentNo. 4,331,647 issued to Goldenberg, United States Patent No.3,927,193 to Hansen, et al. . The methods utilized byGoldenberg, et al., however, required either repeated injection of other radioactive materials or single injection of mixtures of radioactive antibody in order to attain sufficient resolution to distinguish tumors from non target areas. The development of monoclonal antibodies specific for myosin, a contractile proteinaceous substance that is accessible to circulating antibody upon cardiac cell death or damage, has allowed development of methods utilizing radioimsunoimaging to locate and quantify myocardial infarcts see United States Pat. 4,036,945 to Haber . Strauss 1984,Diagnostic Imaging Feb. 1984, p. 54 highlights possible uses and potential problems with such antibodies. 2.2. ATTACHMENT OF RADIOLABELS A number of radioisotopes including 125Iodine, 131Iodine, 111Indium, and 67Copper have been attached to monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies for use in detection of tumors in vivo in animal models. Vincour 1984, DiagnosticImaging, Feb. 1984, pp. 56 61 reviews the problems experienced with such radiolabeled antibodies, noting especially the need for development of radiolabels which remain more stably affixed to the antibody molecule Id. at 57 . Recently Hnatowich, et al. 1983, Science 220 613615 and Powe, et al. 1984, Cancer Drug Delivery 1 125 135 described a method of attaching 111In to antibody molecules or fragments utilizing the water soluble cylic or bicyclic anhydride of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid DTPA . In both these references the antibody was attached to the water soluble chelator, DTPA, via an acylation reaction. 2.3. RADIOIMMUNOIMAGES AND LOCALIZATION A common feature of prior art in vivo images generated either with radioactive metal chelates or 131Iodine attached to antibodies is non targeted localization in organs such as liver or spleen or thyroid for 131I . Such nonspecific localization results in images which do not accurately delineate the position, orientation or size of the intended target. Frequently, background subtraction of non specifically localized radioactivity does not adequately compensate. 2. 4. RADIO IMMUNOTHERAPY The primary distinctions between the materials used in radioimmunoimaging and radioimmunotherapy are the amount and type the radiation employed. In a therapeutic context, radiation is employed to kill target cells while causing minimal toxicity to non targeted cells. Thus, the radiation ideally has high energy and a short travel range in tissue.Since therapeutic applications involve antibody conjugates which are lethal to cells, any non specific localization presents a serious problem for which one cannot compensate by background subtraction . Consequently, products and methods which provide limited success with in vivo imaging may not be suitable at all for therapeutic applications. 3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the general methods of the present invention, a metal ion is attached to an antibody or antibody fragment directed against a target antigen. Attachment is accomplished using chelators i.e., compounds that are able to donate electrons and combine by coordinate bonding with a metal ion to form structures termed chelates or chelation complexes between the metal ion and the antibody. After formation of antibody metal ion complexes, non specifically attached metal ions should be removed. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention then, removal of non specifically attached metal ions from the complexes is accomplished using a high performance liquid molecular sieve chromatography system.This enhances the precision and resolution of the radioimages obtained when using the complexes in vivo, and represents a significant improvement over prior methods in which less than 50 of the metal ion may be specifically bound to the chelator portion of the antibody chelator conjugate, and in which some of the antibody may be aggregated. In its most general concept, the invention contemplates site selective attachment of compatible chelators to those areas of antibodies or antibody fragments which are not a part of nor directly involved with the antigenic site of the molecule. Thus, after selective attachment of a compatible chelator to one of these sites located outside the antigen binding region , the antibody conjugate formed has substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the unconjugated antibody or antibody fragment. In one embodiment of the present invention, compatible chelators containing an amine group selected from the group consisting of primary amine, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine, semicarbazide and thiosemicarbazide groups are attached directly to the oxidized carbohydrate moieties of the antibodies or antibody fragments according to methods of attachment described here in. In another embodiment of the present invention, compatible chelators having certain reactive groups capable of reaction with a sulfhydryl group may be attached to reduced antibodies or reduced Fab 2 fragments. 4.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The instant invention concerns antibody metal ion complexes prepared by attaching a metal ion to an antibody or antibody fragment directed against a target antigen.Compatible chelators capable of coordinate bonding with a metal ion are utilized to attach the metal ions to the antibody or antibody fragment. Such chelators are selectively attached to those areas of antibodies or antibody fragments which are not a part of nor directly involved with the antigenic site of the molecule. In particular, the invention concerns methods for preparing antibody metal ion complexes, comprising a reacting an antibody or antibody fragment with an oxidizing agent to form an aldehyde group in the carbohydrate moiety of the antibody or antibody fragment b reacting the aldehyde group of the resultant oxidized antibody or antibody fragment with a compatible chelator containing an amine group selected from the group consisting of primary amine, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine, semicarbazide and thiosemicarbazide groups to form an antibody chelator conjugate having substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the unconjugated antibody or antibody fragment and c combining the antibody chelator conjugate with a metal ion under conditions which allow chelation of the metal ion to the chelator of the antibody chelator conjugate to form an antibody metal ion complex. In certain circumstances, it may be desirable to separate the above described method for preparing antibodymetal ion complexes into two parts. The first part would produce an antibody chelator conjugate, which may be considered an intermediate in the production of the final antibody metal ion complex. Such antibody chelator conjugates may be stored for later combination with the particular metal ion of interest. Thus, the first part of the two part method would involve steps a and b above to form the intermediate antibody chelator conjugate. The second part, possibly at a later point in time, would involve complexing the antibody chelator conjugate with a metal ion to produce the final antibody metal ion complex. Such antibody metal ion complexes can also be made by alternate methods, as, for example, by first coordinately bonding the compatible chelator to the metal ion, and then reacting the antibody or antibody fragment with the chelator metal ion complex to form the antibody metal ion complex. Thus, the invention further includes a method for preparing an antibody metal ion complex, comprising a reacting an antibody or antibody fragment with an oxidizing agent to form an aldehyde group in the carbohydrate moiety of the antibody or antibody fragment and b reacting the aldehyde group of the resultant oxidized antibody or antibody fragment with a chelator metal ion complex, said chelator metal ion complex comprising a compatible chelator containing an amine group selected from the group consisting of primary amine, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine, semicarbazide and thiosemicarbazide groups coordinately bound to a metal ion, to form an antibody metal ion complex having substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the unconjugated antibody or antibody fragment. In this embodiment, the compatible chelator is coordinately bound to the metal ion prior to covalent attachment of the chelator to the antibody or antibody fragment. The invention is also directed to intermediates and final products of the above described methods. More specifically, this invention is directed to antibody chelator conjugates comprising a compatible chelator attached through a covalent bond to a carbohydrate moiety of an oxidized antibody or antibody fragment, said antibody chelator conjugate having substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the unconjugated antibody or antibody fragment.Additionally, the invention concerns antibodymetal ion complexes comprising an antibody chelator conjugate comprising a compatible chelator attached through a covalent bond to a carbohydrate moiety of an oxidized antibody or antibody fragment, said antibody chelator conjugate coordinately bound through said compatible chelator to a metal ion to form an antibody metal ion complex having substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the unconjugated antibody or antibody fragment. Also encompassed by the invention are antibodychelator conjugates and antibody metal ion complexes in which the compatible chelator is attached to a sulfur atom of a reduced antibody or Fab fragment. These embodiments of the invention involve a method for preparing an antibody metal ion complex, comprising a reacting an antibody or the Fab 2 fragment of an antibody with a mild reducing agent to form a reduced antibody or Fab fragment having a sulfhydryl group b reacting said sulfhydryl group with a compatible chelator containing a reactive group selected from the group consisting of haloalkyl groups, p mercuribenzoate groups, and groups capable of Michael type addition reactions, to form an antibody chelator conjugate having substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the unconjugated antibody or Fab fragment and c combining the antibody chelator conjugate with a metal ion under conditions which allow chelation of the metal ion to the antibody chelator conjugate to form an antibody metal ion complex. Alternatively, the same antibody metal ion complexes can be made by another method, comprising a reacting an antibody or the Fab 2 fragment of an antibody with a mild reducing agent to form a reduced antibody or Fab fragment having a sulfhydryl group and b reacting said sulfhydryl group with a chelator metal ion complex containing a reactive group selected from the group consisting of haloalkyl groups, pmercuribenzoate groups, and groups capable of Michael type addition reactions, said chelator metal ion complex comprising a compatible chelator coordinately bound to a metal ion to, form an antibody metal ion complex having substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the unconjugated antibody or Fab 2 fragment. The product antibody metal ion complex comprises an antibody chelator conjugate comprising a compatible chelator attached through a covalent bond to a sulfur atom of a reduced antibody or Fab fragment, said antibody chelator conjugate coordinately bound through said compatible chelator to a metal ion to form an antibody metal ion complex having substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the unconjugated antibody or Fab 2 fragment. Furthermore, the invention contemplates the intermediate antibody chelator conjugate which comprises a compatible chelator attached through a covalent bond to a sulfur atom of a reduced antibody or Fab fragment, said antibody chelator conjugate having substantially the same immunoreactivity and immunospecificity as the unconjugated antibody or Fab 2 fragment. Independent of the method by which the antibodymetal ion complexes of the invention are made, it has been found that improved results may be obtained in ensuing uses of the complexes, particularly in vivo, when the complexes are purified to separate the antibody metal ion complexes from non chelated metal ions to obtain antibody metal ion complexes substantially free of non chelated metal ions. By substantially free of non chelated metal ions is meant at least about 80 90 percent free of such ions. More specifically, the purified complexes of the invention contain metal ion chelated to the chelator, but are substantially free of metal ion adventitiously bound to antibody, that is, metal ion associated with the antibody protein or carbohydrate and not complexed to the chelator. The purification can be accomplished by any suitable purification method, including but not limited to high performance gel permeation liquid chromatography. This purification step has the additional benefit of removing undesirable aggregates of antibodies prior to administration. Any such antibody aggregates or denatured antibodies would be taken up by the reticuloendothelial system for removal, and this transport away from the target site or specific tissue to be imaged would diminish the degree of localization or the quality of the image. The antibody metal ion complexes of the invention are ideally suited for high resolution tissue imaging in vivo. Such imaging of specific tissue involves administering to a human an effective amount of an antibody metal ion complex, wherein said antibody metal ion complex is immunoreactive with and immunospecific for an antigenic determinant of said specific tissue and substantially nonimmunoreactive with and non immunospecific for non specific tissue and said antigenic determinant is not found in substantial amount in non specific tissue. As demonstrated in the examples hereafter, this method can be used to localize specific tissue with a minimum of background dispersal of metal ion. Further in vivo uses of the antibody metal ion complexes of the invention include therapeutic treatment of cellular disorders. Such methods comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody metal ion complex of the invention, said antibody metal ion complex being immunoreactive with and immunospecific for a target site associated with said cellular disorder and substantially non immunoreactive with and non immunospecific for tissue not associated with said cellular disorder, and wherein the metal ion emits cytotoxic beta particles or alpha particles. Finally, the complexes of the invention may also be used in methods for testing for antigen, which involve, for example, a mixing an antibody metal ion complex with a sample suspected of containing a particular antigen, the antibody metal ion complex being immunoreactive with and immunospecific for said antigen, and b detecting any interaction of said antibody metal ion complex with any antigen in the sample. Other applications for in vitro uses may similarly be found and developed by one of ordinary skill. 5.1. ANTIBODIES According to the present invention, antibodies directed against any antigen or hapten may be used. Although conventional antibodies antisera may be used, monoclonal antibodies offer several advantages. Each monoclonal antibody is specific for one antigenic determinant.Additionally, large amounts of each monoclonal antibody can be produced. Antibodies used in the present invention may be directed against any target, e.g., tumor, bacterial, fungal, viral, parasitic, mycoplasmal, histocompatability, differentiation and other cell membrane antigens, pathogen surface antigens, toxins, enzymes, allergens, drugs and any biologically active molecules. Drugs of particular interest are opioids, amphetamines, barbiturates, steroids, catecholamines, dilantin, theophylline, histamine, cannabinoids, and the like. For a more complete list of antigens, see U.S. Patent 4,193,983, particularly columns 7 11, which patent specification is incorporated herein by reference. When it is desired to image cardiovascular disease or damage following, e.g., myocardial infarcts, antibodies directed against myosin or another cardiac cytosol protein may be used. Additionally, a combination of antibodies reactive to different antigenic determinants may be used.Immunoglobulins which may be used as carriers include certain classes of antibodies such as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgM certain classes ofIgG or certain fragments of immunoglobulins, e.g., half antibody molecules a single heavy light chain pair , or Fab,Fab , or Fab 2 fragments. Use of antibody fragments may be advantageous for tissue imaging systems because these antibody fragments permeate target sites at an increased rate. The Fab fragments of IgG immunoglobulins are obtained by cleaving the antibody molecule with pepsin resulting in a bivalent fragment, Fab 2 or with papain resulting in 2 univalent fragments, 2 Fab . Parham, 1983, J. Immunol. 131 2895 2902 Lamoyi and Nisonoff, 1983, J. Immunol. Meth. 56 235 243.The bivalent Fab1 2 fragment can be split by mild reduction of one or a few disulfide bonds to yield univalent Fab fragments. The Fab and Fab 2 fragments are smaller than a whole antibody molecule and, therefore, permeate the target site or tissue more easily. This may offer an advantage for in vivo imaging since conjugates will more readily penetrate in vivo sites e.g., tumor masses, infection sites, etc. . An additional advantage is obtained when using conjugates formed with antibody fragments because these fragments do not cross a placental barrier. As a result, using this embodiment of the invention, an in vivo site such as a tumor may be imaged in a pregnant female without exposing the fetus to the imaging compound. 5.2. COMPATIBLE CHELATORS As used herein, the term compatible chelator means any compound that a is able to donate electrons and combine by coordinate bonding with a metal ion to form structures called chelates or chelation complexes and b is suitable for attachment to an antibody or antibody fragment without loss of ability to chelate metal ions or destruction of the immunoreactivity or immunospecificity of the antibody or antibody fragment. Where necessary, derivatives of known chelators may be synthesized such that the product is a compatible chelator suitable for attachment to antibodies or antibody fragments by methods of the invention. Of additional interest are compatible chelators which have multiple sites for chelation of metal ions. For multiple site compatible chelators, a single covalent attachment to an antibody or antibody fragment would result in a conjugate capable of binding metal ion at a number of sites. Radioactive complexes of such conjugates would have high specific radioactivity, that is, high radioactivity per antibody molecule. Alternatively, higher specific radioactivity or higher ratios of metal ion to antibody molecule can be achieved by attachment of a single site compatible chelator at a plurality of sites of the antibody or antibody fragment.This plurality of sites may be introduced into the antibody or antibody fragment by either of two methods. First, one may generate multiple aldehyde groups and or sulfhydryl groups in the same antibody molecule. Second, one may attach to aldehyde or sulfhydryl of the antibody molecule a branched linker having multiple functional sites for subsequent attachment to compatible chelators. The functional sites of the branched linker may be aldehyde or sulfhydryl groups, or may be any chemical site to which compatible chelators may be attached. Still higher specific radioactivities may be obtained by combining these two approaches, that is, attaching multiple site compatible chelators at several sites on the antibody or antibody fragment. Immediately below are identified some important classes of compatible chelators suitable for use in the present inventions. Compatible chelators include, but are not limited to, derivatives of diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA , d imere aptosuce in ic acid, 2, 3 dimercaptopropanesul fonic acid, metallothioein and cryptates, such as those recently described by Gansow, et al. 1981, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 18 297 . 5.2.1. COMPATIBLE CHELATORS FOR CARBOHYDRATE ATTACHMENT As previously explained, compatible chelators are utilized to attach metal ions to antibody molecules.According to the present invention, suitable compatible chelators for reaction with oxidized antibodies or oxidized antibody fragments include those containing an amine selected from the group consisting of primary amine, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine, semicarbazide and thiosemicarbazide groups. Such reactive functional groups may exist as part of the structure of the chelator, or may be introduced by suitable chemistry on chelators not containing such groups. For example, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid DTPA lacks the appropriate amine group for facile attachment to oxidized carbohydrate. However, chemical modification can produce a variety of suitable derivatives, such as amine containing derivatives of mixed anhydrides ofDTPA including, but not limited to p aminoaniline DTPA, hydra z ide DTPA, phenylhydraz ide DTPA, hydroxylam ine DTPA, semicarbazide DTPA, thiosemicarbazide DTPA, polyethylene imine DTPA, p phenylenediamine DTPA, DTPA mono 4 aminophenyl methyl amide and amino acid containing derivatives of DTPA, including, but not limited to N DrPA L lysine, glycyl tyrosyl lysine DTPA and L lysine benzyl ester DTPA. 5.2.2. COMPATIBLE CHELATORS FOR SULFHYDRYL ATTACHMENT According to the present invention, suitable compatible chelators for attachment to reduced antibody or antibody fragments include chelators having certain reactive groups capable of reaction with a sulfhydryl group of a reduced antibody or Fab fragment. Such reactive groups include, but are not limited to, reactive haloalkyl groups including, for example, haloacetyl groups , pmercuribenzoate groups and groups capable of Michael type addition reactions including, for example, maleimides and groups of the type described in Mitra and Lawton, 1979, J.Amer, Chem. Soc. 101 3097 3110 . By the term haloalkyl is meant any alkyl group of one to three carbon atoms substituted with bromine, iodine or chlorine. Iodoalkyl groups, for example, may be introduced into the structure of known chelators, including, but not limited to, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, dimercaptosuccinic acid, 2,3 dimercaptopropanesul fon ic acid, metallothioe in and cryptates. 5.3. METHODS OF ATTACHMENT TO ANTIBODIES AND ANTIBODY FRAGMENTS According to the methods of the present invention, a compatible chelator or compatible chelator metal ion complex is attached to an antibody directed against a target antigen, by a attachment to the carbohydrate moieties of the antibody or antibody fragment, or b attachment to sulfhydryl groups of the antibody molecule. Whichever method is used, the attachment must not significantly change the essential characteristics of the antibody or antibody fragment, such as immunospecificity and immunoreactivity.Additional considerations include simplicity of reaction and stability of the antibody conjugate produced. 5.3.1. ATTACHMENT TO OXIDIZED CARBOHYDRATE MOIETIES Glycoproteins are biologically important macromolecules which share structural characteristics including carbohydrate residues covalently attached to a polypeptide backbone. Since antibodies are glycoproteins, compounds may be attached to the carbohydrate moiety of the molecule. Some of the carbohydrate moieties are located on the Fc region of the immunoglobulin and are required in order for C1 binding to occur. The carbohydrate moiety of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin may be utilized in the scheme described herein. Alternatively, the Fab or Fab fragments of any immunoglobulins which contain carbohydrate moieties may be utilized in the reaction scheme described herein. An example of such an immunoglobulin is the human IgM sequenced by Putnam, et al. 1973, Science 182 287 . As explained in detail below, the carbohydrate side chains of antibodies or Fab or Fab fragments may be selectively oxidized to generate aldehydes. The resulting aldehydes may then be reacted with amine groups e.g., ammonia derivatives such as a primary amine, hydroxylamine, hydraz ine, hydraz ide, phenylhydraz ine, semicarbazide or thiosemicarbazide to form a Schiff base or reduced Schiff base e.g., imine, enamine, oxime, hydrazone, phenylhydrazone, semicarbazone or thiosemicarbazone, or reduced forms thereof . Alternatively, the carbohydrate moiety of the antibody may be modified by enzymatic techniques so as to enable attachment to or reaction with other chemical groups.One example of such an enzyme is galactose oxidase which oxidizes galactose in the presence of oxygen to form an aldehyde. 5.3.1. 1. CHEMICAL METHODS OF OXIDATION Oxidation of the carbohydrate portion or moiety of antibody molecules leads to formation of aldehyde groups. A variety of oxidizing agents can be used, such as periodic acid, paraperiodic acid, sodium metaperiodate and potassum metaperiodate. Among these, oxygen acids and salts thereof are preferred since secondary or undesirable side reactions are less frequent. For a general discussion, see Jackson, 1944, Organic Reactions 2, p. 341 Bunton, 1965, Oxidation inOrganic Chemistry, Vol. 1 Wiberg, ed. , Academic Press, NewYork, p. 367. Oxidation of antibodies with these oxidizing agents can be carried out by known methods. In the oxidation, the antibody is used generally in the form of an aqueous solution, the concentration being generally less than 100 mg ml, preferably 1 to 20 mg ml. When an oxygen acid or a salt thereof is used as the oxidizing agent, it is used generally in the form of an aqueous solution, and the concentration is generally 0.001 to l0mM and preferably 1.0 to 10my. The amount of the oxygen acid or salt thereof depends on the kind of antibody, but generally it is used in excess, for example, twice to ten times as much as the amount of the oxidizable carbohydrate. The optimal amount, however, can be determined by routine experimentation. In the process for oxidizing antibodies with oxygen acids or salts thereof, the optional ranges include a pH of from about 4 to 8, a temperature of from 0 to 370C, and a reaction period of from about 15 minutes to 12 hours. During the oxidation of the glycoprotein with an oxygen acid or a salt thereof, light is preferably excluded to prevent over oxidation of the glycoprotein. 5.3.1.2. ENZYMATIC METHODS OF OXIDATION Oxidation of the carbohydrate portion of antibody molecules may also be done with the enzyme, galactose oxidase Cooper, et al., 1959, J. Biol. Chem. 234 445 448 . The antibody is used in aqueous solution, the concentration being generally 0.5 to 20 mg ml. The enzyme generally is used at about 5 to 100 units per ml of solution, at a pH ranging from about 5.5 to about 8.0. The influence of pH, substrate concentration, buffers and buffer concentrations on enzyme reaction are reported in Cooper, et al., supra. 5.3.1.3. PREPARATION OF ANTIBODY CHELATOR CONJUGATES The antibody chelator conjugates or antibody metal ion complexes when pre chelated metal ion is attached to the chelator prior to reaction of the chelator with antibody of the invention may be produced by reacting the oxidized antibody with a compatible chelator having an available amine group selected from the group consisting of primary amine, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine, semicarbazide and thiosemicarbazide groups.The immediately resulting products antibody chelator conjugates or antibody metal ion complexes contain a carbon nitrogen double bond resulting from elimination of a molecule of water from the initial addition products EMI25.1 For a general discussion of the reaction of aldehydes with hydrazides, see March, 1978, Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, McGraw Hill Co., NewYork, p. 824 825. A solution of the oxidized antibody at a concentration of from about 0.5 to 20 mg ml is mixed with the compatible chelator molar ratios of reactive chelator group to antibody aldehyde ranging from about 1 to about 10,000 and the solution incubated for from about 1 to 18 hours.Suitable temperatures are from 0 to 370C and pH may be from about 6 to 8.5.3.1.4. STABILIZATION OF THE ANTIBODY CHELATOR CONJUGATES After the antibody chelator conjugates or antibody metal ion complexes have been formed between the antibody and a compatible chelator as described in Section 5.3.1.3, they can optionally be stabilized with a suitable reducing agent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride EMI25.2 Reducing agent is generally added to a molar excess of from about 10 to 100 fold molar excess over available aldehyde groups. For a general discussion, see Jentoft and Dearborn, 1979, J. Biol. Chem. 254 4359. 5.3.2. ATTACHMENT TO SULFHYDRYL GROUPS Free sulfhydryl groups can be generated from the disulfide bonds of the immunoglobulin molecule. This is accomplished by mild reduction of the antibody molecule. The disulfide bonds of IgG which are generally most susceptible to reduction are those that link the two heavy chains. The disulfide bonds located near the antigen binding region of the antibody molecule remain relatively unaffected. Such reduction results in the loss of ability to fix complement but does not interfere with antibody antigen binding ability Karush, et al., 1979, Biochem. 18 2226 2232 . The free sulfhydryl groups generated in the intra heavy chain region can then react with reactive groups of a compatible chelator to form a covalent bond which does not interfere with the antigen binding site of the immunoglobulin.Such reactive groups include, but are not limited to, reactive haloalkyl groups including, for example, haloacetyl groups , pmercuribenzoate groups and groups capable of Michael type addition reactions including, for example, maleimides and groups of the type described in Mitra and Lawton, 1979, J.Amer, Chem. Soc. 101 3097 3110 . By the term haloalkyl is meant any alkyl group of one to three carbon atoms substituted with bromine, iodine or chlorine. Details of the conditions, methods and materials suitable for mild reduction of antibodies and antibody fragments as described generally herein may be found inStanworth and Turner, IN Handbook of Experimental Immunology,Vol. 1, Second Edition, Weir ed. , Chapter 10, Blackwell Scientific Publications, London, 1973, which chapter is incorporated herein by reference. Antibody chelator conjugates or antibody metal ion complexes when pre chelated metal ion is attached to the chelator prior to reaction of the chelator with antibody which are produced by attaching a compatible chelator to a free sulfhydryl group of a reduced immunoglobulin or reduced antibody fragment do not activate complement. Thus, complexes of the conjugates may advantageously be used in in vivo imaging systems where release of the metal ion is not desirable. 5.4. PREPARATION OF COMPLEXES Chelator metal ion complexes may be prepared by attaching the metal ion directly to the chelator.Conventional methods of attaching metal ions to chelators may be utilized to accomplish binding to chelator. For example, 111Indium 111In may be attached to a water soluble chelator compound by incubation of 111In C13 in sodium acetate with the chelator, e.g., for 1 hour at 370C. As explained previously, according to the present invention, the metal ion may be attached to the chelator either before or after the chelator is attached to the antibody molecule. Whatever method of attachment is utilized, it may be significant for many applications that any metal ion not specifically attached to the chelator compound be removed before the complexes are used, particularly in vivo. According to the preferred embodiment, the non specifically attached metal ion is removed using a high performance liquid molecular sieve chromatography system. For in vitro detection systems, e.g., improved immunoradiometric assay systems, the antibody molecule or antibody fragment may be attached to a compatible chelator according to methods described herein, and the antibodychelator conjugate intermediate may be purified, if necessary, and stored frozen at 200C until needed. The metal ion may then be attached to the antibody chelator conjugate.For instance, 111Indium may be attached by incubation of 111InC13 with the antibody chelator conjugate in acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 370C for 1 hour. Such method of attachment advantageously allows purification of the antibody chelator intermediate without exposing the preparer to excessive handling of radioactive materials, and without necessity of lengthy storage of radioisotopes in the work areas. 5.5. USES OF ANTIBODY METAL ION COMPLEXES The antibody metal ion complexes of the invention are useful in a variety of therapeutic and in vitro and in vivo diagnostic applications. Throughout this application the term cellular disorders is meant to include all neoplasms, including cancers, adenomas, and hyperplasias certain immunological disorders, including autoimmune diseases, graft versus host diseases e.g., after bone marrow transplantation , immune suppressive diseases, e.g., after kidney or bone marrow transplantation. Treatment of such cellular disorders involving, for example, bone marrow transplantation, may include purging by killing undesired cells, e.g., malignant cells or mature T lymphocytes. 5.5.1. IN VIVO THERAPEUTICS Therapeutic applications center generally on treatment of various cellular disorders, including those broadly described above, by administering an effective amount of the antibody metal ion complexes of the invention. The properties of the antibody in being immunospecific for and immunoreactive with a particular antigen render it ideally suited for delivering metal ions to specific cells, tissues, organs or any other site having that particular antigen. According to this aspect of the invention, the antibody or antibody fragment of the antibody metal ion complex functions to deliver the complex to the target site, at which site the metal ion, which is chosen for its cell killing properties, is able to destroy nearby cells. Suitable beta emitting ions for therapeutic uses include 46Scandium, 47Scandium, 48Scandium, 72Gallium and 73Gallium. Suitable alpha emitting metal ions include those with a relatively short half life of about four days or less, including 211Bismuth, 212Bismuth, 213Bismuth and 214Bismuth, with 212Bismuth being preferred. In vivo administration may involve use of pharmaceutical compositions of antibody metal ion complex in any suitable carrier, including serum or physiological saline, with or without another protein, such as human serum albumin. Dosage of the complexes may readily be determined by one of ordinary skill, and may differ depending upon the nature of the cellular disorder and the metal ion used.Route of administration may be parenteral, with intravenous administration generally preferred. 5.5.2. IN VIVO DIAGNOSTICS In vivo diagnostic applications involve imaging of specific tissues or cellular disorders by administration of a sufficient amount of the antibody metal ion complexes of the invention to enable the complexes to localize at the tissue in the appropriate time frame. Dosage and other aspects of administration of the complexes in vivo are generally discussed in the preceding section. A wide variety of metal ions suitable for in vivo tissue imaging have been tested and utilized clinically. For imaging with radioisotopes the following characteristics are generally recognized as desirable and or necessary a low radiation dose to the patient b high photon yield which permits a nuclear medicine procedure to be performed in a short time period c ability to be produced in sufficient quanitites d acceptable cost e simple preparation for administration and f no requirement for subsequent isolation of the patient.These characteristics generally translate into the following a the radiation exposure to the most critical organ is less than 5 radt b a single image can be obtained in several hours c the radioisotope does not decay by emission of a particle e.g., ss or d the isotope can be readily detected and e the halflife is less than four days. Lamb and Kramer, CommercialProduction of Radioisotopes for Nuclear Medicine , INRadiotracers For Medical Applications, Vol. 1, Rayudu ed. ,CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, pp. 17 62. An alternative method for imaging with radioisotopes involves positron emission tomography. Suitable positron emitting isotopes include 43Scandium, 44Scandium, 52Iron, 55Cobalt and 68Gallium. Tissue imaging may also utilize nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions such as 54Iron, 56Iron, 57Iron, 58Iron, 157Gadolinium and 55Manganese, which are detectible by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Tissues which one may image include any solid neoplasm, certain organs such as lymph nodes, parathyroids, spleen and kidney, sites of inflammation or infection e.g., macrophages at such sites , myocardial infarction or thromboses neoantigenic determinants on fibrin or platelets , etc. 5.5.3. IN VITRO DIAGNOSTICS In vitro analytical procedures for detecting a particular antigen using the antibody metal ion complexes of the invention employ standard immunoradiometric assay techniques. For a general review of such techniques, seeHales and Woodhead, Methods in Enzymology 70 334 355 1980 .Generally, immunoradiometric assays IRA involve labeled antibodies to detect unlabeled antigens. Numerous variations of.the immunoradiometric assay have been developed, including for example, the two site IRA and the indirect IRA. These two methods are discussed generally below. The objective of the two site IRA is to use a specific antibody on a solid phase, e.g., cellulose orSepharose, to extract antigen. While the antibody remains bound to the solid phase, a second labeled antibody is bound to another site on the antigen. The second antigen can then be measured as a function of the amount of bound labeled antibody. In this method the antigen is bound to two different antibodies at two sites on the antigen. In another method purified antigen is adsorbed or coupled to a solid phase support. In the indirect IRA the first antibody used for measuring antigen is indirectly labeled through the use of a labeled antibody to the immunoglobulin of the same species as that in which the first antibody is raised. This labeled anti immunoglobulin antibody is then reacted with the first antibody and antigen. The labeled antibody can also be used in the conventional or two site IRAs. These diagnostic techniques and others are intended to be encompassed by the present invention. In the context of this invention, all of these IRA methods for testing for antigen have in common the following two steps a mixing an antibody metal ion complex with a sample suspected of containing the antigen, and b detecting the interaction, if any antigen is present, of said complex with the antigen. For in vitro diagnostics, all of the gamma and positron emitting metal ions, as well as the paramagnetic metal ions in Section 5.5.2, as well as 153Gadolinium are suitable. For fluorescence diagnostic assays, lanthanides may be employed, including Praseodymium, Neodymium, Samarium,Europium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium,Thulium and Ytterbium. 6.

ATTACHMENT OF CHELATOR TO ANTIBODY AND METAL ION The specific monoclonal antibody utilized in the following experiments for injection into experimental animals was a rat IgG antibody specific for a Class I major histocompatability complex MHC antigen of Brown Norway BN rats. This antibody, designated CYT 015, was prepared by fusion of spleen cells from Lewis rats previously immunized by injection with cells from BN rats, with myeloma cell lineSP2 0 AG14 according to the method described by McKearn, et al. 1979, Immunol. Rev. 47 91 115 . After cloning, CYT015 containing ascites were generated by intraperitoneal injection of cells into pristane primed nude mice.IgG monoclonal antibody was purified from this ascites by specific elution on a Protein A Sepharose column PharmaciaFine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ . A mouse monoclonal IgG antibody specific for a monomorphic determinant of a human Class I major histocompatibility complex was used as a carrier antibody for conjugates injected into control animals. This antibody is designated CYT 012. 6.2.1. FORMATION OF ANTIBODY CHELATOR CONJUGATES Radiolabeled antibody metal ion complexes were prepared according to one method of the instant invention by first forming antibody chelator conjugates. The carbohydrate moiety of the antibody CYT 012 or CYT 015 was oxidized by reacting approximately 1 mg ml glycoprotein in phosphate buffered saline PBS with 10 mM sodium metaperiodate Nab4 pH 6.0 for 1 hour on ice in the dark. The sample was then passed through a Sephadex G 25 column Pharmacia FineChemicals, Piscataway, NJ and the protein fractions pooled.The oxidized antibody was then attached to a compatible chelator and either used immediately or stored frozen at 200C. For example, glycyl tyrosyl lysine diethylene triaminepentaacetic acid GYK DTPA was coupled to oxidized antibody by incubating an aliquot of the antibody with a 200 fold molar excess of GYK DTPA in PBS pH 6.0 for 30 minutes at room temperature. To stabilize the product sodium cyanoborohydride NaCNBH3 was added to a final concentration of 10mM, and the reaction mixture was maintained at room temperature for a period ranging from 2 hours to overnight.The sample was then passed through a Sephadex G 50 column Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ and the protein fractions were pooled. In other experiments, oxidized antibody was coupled either to p aminoaniline diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ADTPA or polyethyleneimine diethyenetriaminepentaacetic acid PEI DTPA by the same method except that a 2000 fold molar excess of ADTPA or PEI DTPA was utilized. 6.2.2. FORMATION OF ANTIBODY METAL ION COMPLEXES Radioactive metal ion was then attached to the antibody chelator conjugates in order to form radioactive antibody metal ion complexes useful for imaging systems. For example1 20 ul of stock 111Indium chloride 111In Cl3 New England Nuclear, Boston, MA representing 1 2 mCi was added to 20 lll 0.5M sodium acetate pH 6.0 , and incubated with antibody chelator conjugate prepared as described above 50 200 g for 1 hour at 370C. The sample was then eluted through a Sephadexe G 50 column PharmaciaFine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ and the protein fractions pooled. The pooled 111In labeled antibody metal ion complex was rechromatographed through a Waters Protein Pak 300SW high performance liquid chromatography HPLC column WatersAssociates, Milford, MA , and fractions were collected.The fraction corresponding to the elution volume of IgG in molecular weight represents the antibody metal ion complex. FIG. 1, for example, illustrates an HPLC chromatogram obtained during purification and isolation of 111Indium labeled anti Brown Norway major histocompatibility complex antibody metal ion complex, 111In CYT 015 ADTPA. As shown in FIG. 1, the optical density of the fraction containing peak radioactivity reveals the similarity of the antibody metal ion complex to monomeric unconjugated IgG. 7.

EXAMPLES IMAGING USING RADIOLABELED ANTIBODY METAL ION COMPLEXES The following examples illustrate methods for in vivo imaging to locate specific tissue or organ components utilizing the radiolabeled antibody metal ion complexes prepared according to the instant invention. 8.1. TUMOR IMAGING In one series of experiments, radiolabeled antibody metal ion complexes were utilized to specifically locate tumorous tissues in experimental animals using a rad ioimag ing system. Nude mice were injected subcutaneously in the left hindquarter with 1 X 106 BN rat lymphoma cells. Seven days post injection when tumor sizes ranged from 2 4 mm in diameter, the animals received a retro orbital sinus or intravenous injection of 10 iig 111Indium labeled anti BN major histocompatability complex MHC antibody metal ion complex,111In CYT 015 ArDTPA. No animal received more than a single injection with complex. Two groups of animals served as controls. One control group of non tumor bearing nude mice were injected either in the retro orbital sinus or intravenously with 10 ug 111In CYT 015 ADTPA. Another control group of nude mice bearing BN tumors were injected with 10 llg 111In CYT 012ADTPA. Radioimaging was accomplished as follows at 24, 48 or 72 hours post injection with radiolabeled antibody metal ion complex, animals were placed directly upon the inverted face of a gamma camera General Electric Maxi Camera 37 interfaced with an ADEC Clinical Data System . Ten thousand 25,000 counts were routinely accumulated on exposed X ray film without correction for background radiation. FIG. 2 illustrates in vivo images of radioactivity accumulated within BN tumor bearing nude mice injected with 1111n CYT 015 ADTPA. Images A, B, C and D were taken 24, 24, 48 and 72 hours after injection, respectively. FIG. 2 clearly demonstrates that the complexes of the invention are specifically localized at the intended target with extremely low levels of non specific localization. FIG. 3 illustrates in vivo images of radioactivity in BN tumor bearing control mice described above. Images E and F were taken 24 and 72 hours after injection, respectively. As shown, in FIG. 3 there was no detectable localization of radioactivity in BN tumor bearing nude mice injected with 111In CYT 012 ADTPA in which the antibody is specific for Class I human MHC antigen. FIG. 4. presents in vivo images of non tumor bearing nude mice injected with 111In CYT 012 ADTPA. Images G and H were taken 24 and 72 hours after injection, respectively. As shown in FIG. 4, there was also no detectable localization of radioactivity in non tumor bearing nude mice injected with radiolabeled antibody metal ion complex, 111In CYT 015 ADTPA, specific for BN tumor antigen. 8. 2. RENAL TRANSPLANT IMAGING In another series of experiments, radiolabeled antibody metal ion complexes were utilized to specifically locate transplanted renal tissues by in vivo radioimaging. Experimental rats bearing a transplanted functioning kidney or renal allograft were prepared as follows the left kidney of a Lewis rat was surgically removed and a kidney from a BN x Lewis F1 rat was implanted in its place. The recipients immune response against the foreign kidney transplant was chemically suppressed see Stuart, et al., 1980, Immunol. Rev. 49 127 165 . Thus, the recipient rats possessed two functioning kidneys, only one of which carried the BN MHC antigen specifically recognized by CYT 015 antibody. Six to twelve months post transplantation, the recipient rats were intravenously injected with 10 iig 111In CYT 015 ADTPA, and imaged as described in Section 8.1. In FIG. 5, images A and B were taken approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes after intravenous injection. As shown in FIG. 5, image A, the radionuclide localized within the transplanted kidney within approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes after intravenous injection of the labeled antibody metal ion complex. Minimal accumulation of radioactivity was detected in the animal s kidney, lungs, spleen or liver. FIG. 5, image B, illustrates the image obtained when the same recipient animal was injected with a commercially available renal imaging agent, 99Technetium DTPA chelate Mallinkrodt, St. Louis, MO . Clearly, images obtained with 99mTechnetium DTPA chelate are inferior to those obtained with the antibody metal ion complexes of the invention. Both kidneys of the recipient animal were clearly functioning.
