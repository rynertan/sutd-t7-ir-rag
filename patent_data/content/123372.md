# Hybrid plasmid with marker.

## Abstract
Decombinant plasmids adopted for transformation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts having an insertion site for at least one DNA fragment are provided. In a preferred embodiment, nucleotide sequences coding for methotrexate resistant dehydrofolate reductase and a nucleotide sequence, a portion thereof coding for a promotor, are ligated into the insertion site.
