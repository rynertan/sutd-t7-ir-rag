## Description
This invention relates generally to the field of CMOS complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology and, more particularly, to a process which uses a single masking step to form self aligned dual wells tubs and self aligned field doping regions in a CMOS structure forming a part of a semiconductor device, such as a field effect transistor. In dual well twin tub CMOS technology, it is highly desirable to utilize as much of the semiconductor chip area as possible. In the past, several lithographic masking steps were required for making integrated circuit chips having densely packed elements and devices thereon, but each masking step inherently requires the dedication of chip areas which otherwise could be occupied by the devices ultimately formed in the chip. Also, in the past, the doping concentration of the dual wells and also of the field regions were dependent upon each other, and or both P and N field isolation regions were doped with a conductivity determining impurity of a first type, one region masked, and the other region doped with a conductivity determining impurity of the opposite type to form the required P doped and N doped field isolation regions. In forming field isolation regions between devices on a chip, it is necessary to provide field doping beneath these isolation regions to provide electrical isolation between adjacent devices or active regions on the same substrate which is, typically, a lightly doped silicon wafer. The fabrication step or steps that produce these isolation regions affects the spacing between devices i.e. the device packing density on the chip, as well as the electrical characteristics of the device. The field doping beneath the isolation regions is often referred to as a parasitic channel stopper doping, and it is used to control the parasitic MOS threshold voltages outside of the active region of a device, such as an FET, and to eliminate unwanted conduction due to inversion under the field isolation when lightly doped substrates are employed. There are many prior art techniques for aligning the field doping to the field isolation. One technique is to use an extra lithographic masking step however, the disadvantages of such an extra masking step have already been discussed. In order to form a recessed isolation oxide with a self aligned field doping, it is also known to provide an oxidation barrier layer, such as silicon nitride, for delineating the device regions. Thin silicon dioxide layers may be provided on either side of the silicon nitride layer to aid in its delineation and to prevent damage to the underlying silicon substrate. The photoresist pattern used to define the device regions also serves as the implantation mask, and the resist regions are located over the future device areas. U.S. Patent No. 4,144,101 Rideout discloses the broad concept of providing a self aligned field doping using only one lithographic masking step. It is important to employ as few masking steps as possible since the lithographic masking steps involved in preparing integrated circuits are among the most critical. Lithographic masking steps require high precision and registration and extreme care in execution. Each additional lithographic masking step in a process introduces possible masking defects and increases mask to mask registration problems that decrease the processing yield and, accordingly, significantly increases the fabrication cost. Although other factors affect the yield and cost, such as, for example, the number of high temperature heat treatments, a basic objective in FET integrated circuit fabrication is to minimize the number of basic lithographic masking steps required to produce a particular integrated circuit array of desired device structures. U.S. Patent No. 4,144,101 discloses a process wherein the incorporation of the doping beneath the preselected isolation regions and the fabrication of the isolation regions require only a single lithographic masking step. More specifically, this patent discloses a process for providing ion implanted doped regions in a substrate beneath preselected regions of an existing layer on the substrate, wherein the doped regions are self aligned to preselected subsequently fabricated regions of the existing layer. The process includes providing a first layer of silicon dioxide on a silicon substrate. Ion implanted doped regions are to be later formed beneath preselected portions of the oxide layer. A resist masking layer is formed on the oxide layer, and active impurities are ion implanted through the oxide layer in those regions not covered by the resist masking material in order to provide ion implanted regions beneath the oxide layer, whereby the resist and oxide layers act as a mask to prevent the implanted ions from penetrating therethrough. A lift off material, such as aluminum, is deposited over the oxide layer and resist layer, and then the resist layer is removed, taking with it the lift off material deposited on it. Then, the portion of the oxide layer which was beneath this layer is removed by etching, using the remaining lift off material as a mask. Then, the remaining lift off material is removed from the oxide layer beneath it, whereby there are obtained implanted regions in the substrate which are self aligned at the edges to the boundaries of preselected fabricated regions of the oxide layer located above the ion implanted regions. In other words, by the use of this lift off technique, the masking pattern is actually reversed from over the device region before implantation, to over the field isolation region after implantation. After the formation of the field doping regions which are self aligned at the edges to the overlying isolation field oxide regions, further lithographic and ion implantation steps are used to form the oxides, device doping and conductors required to complete the fabrication of an FET having gate, source and drain regions. This lift off technique is used in one embodiment of the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 4,435,895 Parrillo et al discloses a dual well or twin tub CMOS process using only a single lithographic masking step for forming self aligned contiguous P and N wells. A silicon nitride layer and a silicon dioxide layer of different thicknesses are used to achieve this self alignment of the wells however, this patent does not address the problem of forming field doping beneath field isolation regions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,280,272 Egawa et al discloses a process of making a twin well CMOS FET by using the conventional method of employing two masking steps to form spaced N and P wells. U.S. Pat. No. 4,244,752 Henderson, Sr. et al discloses a process for making CMOS FET integrated circuits having both P channel and N channel structures, and in which only a P channel well is formed. Both silicon dioxide and silicon nitride layers are formed on a P type wafer to produce a silicon dioxide silicon nitride sandwich, and a first masking step is used to etch away this sandwich to define the active areas of both the P channel and N channel devices to be formed later in those areas covered by the sandwich. A second masking step is used to form a photoresist pattern to enable ion implantation to form a P channel well. With the oxide nitride sandwich serving as a mask, field doping regions are formed by ion implantation of a P type dopant boron . This implant goes into the field regions of both the N channel well, where it is required, and the P channel well where it is not desired. Field isolation oxides are then formed over the field doping regions, using the silicon nitride layer as a mask to prevent oxidation of the active areas of the P channel and N channel devices. The primary object of the invention as claimed is to provide an improved process for making a CMOS dual well semiconductor structure with field isolation doping, wherein only a single lithographic masking step is required for providing self alignment both of the wells to each other and also of the field isolation doping regions to the wells. A simplified version of this process provides a structure having N wells only within a P type semiconductor body. Another object is to provide such a process wherein the slower diffusing N well dopant may be driven in independently of the P well dopant. Another object is to provide such a process which enables independent control of both the well and field dopant profiles. In summary, the invention achieves the above objects by the use of a single lithographic masking step to form a well mask and define an oxidation barrier which, then, acts as an implant mask absorber during the ion implantation of a field dopant of one type an oxidation barrier over one well during the oxidation of the opposite type well to form over the one well a sacrificial oxide layer which forms the alignment marks for subsequent formation of the field doping regions and a dopant transmitter during the ion implantation of an opposite type field dopant which is simultaneously absorbed by the sacrificial oxide. More specifically, in a preferred embodiment the invention involves depositing a silicon nitride layer over a silicon dioxide layer which is disposed over an epi taxial silicon layer. A photoresist mask defines on the silicon nitride layer the positions of the N wells and the P wells, leaving the N well areas exposed, and the silicon nitride layer is removed from those areas. An N type conductivity determining impurity is implanted through the exposed silicon dioxide layer and into the epi layer, using the photoresist as a mask for the P wells. A lift off material, which may be chosen to withstand high temperatures, is deposited over the structure through lift off techniques, and the photoresist with its lift off material is lifted or removed from the P wells. The N well dopants may then be independently driven into the epi layer to form the N wells. A P type dopant is then implanted into the structure for the formation of the P well regions, using the lift off material as a mask to keep the P dopants out of the N well regions. The lift off material is then removed from the N well regions, and an annealing step is used further to drive in the dopants to complete the formation of the profiles of both well regions. During the same step, a relatively thin sacrificial silicon dioxide layer is grown over the N well region not covered by the silicon nitride layer. This grown oxide layer provides an alignment mark for subsequent processing steps. P type field dopants are then implanted into the thin original silicon dioxide layer, which is over the P well regions and underneath the nitride layer, and into the thicker grown silicon dioxide layer over the N well regions. The silicon dioxide layer over the N wells is removed, using the nitride layer as a mask to protect the silicon dioxide layer over the P wells, and a new silicon dioxide layer is grown in its place. An N type dopant is implanted into the new silicon dioxide layer over the N well region, with the nitride layer now absorbing and preventing any N type ions from reaching the silicon dioxide layer over the P wells. Then, the already established alignment mark can be used in subsequent lithographic masking steps to form a complete device. For example, a thick oxide layer is deposited and defined by a lithographic masking step to provide field isolation regions around the well regions. During the definition of the field isolation oxide regions, the previously doped oxide layers in the active device regions of both type wells are removed, thereby leaving the remaining doped layers over only the defined isolation regions a subsequent heat cycle drives the N and P type dopants out of their respective remaining oxide layers and into the selected epi regions to form the field dopings beneath the oxide field isolations. One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the drawings which illustrate one preferred embodiment, in which In the preferred embodiment of the process for forming, with a single lithographic masking step, a CMOS semiconductor structure having twin wells, which are self aligned to each other, and an alignment feature self aligned to the wells for use in subsequent lithographic masking steps for forming, for example, field isolation regions, the following sequential steps are employed. If desired, the lift off steps may be eliminated so that only N wells are formed in a P type substrate. Otherwise the same steps are employed, but the photoresist masking layer 16 is removed in a separate step between the implant step 7 and the anneal step in step 8 .
