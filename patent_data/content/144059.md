# Photographic element.

## Abstract
A photographic element containing, as a mordant, a polymer comprising a monomer unit having at least an imidazole ring and a monomer unit having at least a sulfinic acid group. The mordant provides dye images of high transfer density and improves fastness of the dye images to light or high temperature and humidity.
