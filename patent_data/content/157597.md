# Means for quantitative determination of analyte in liquids.

## Abstract
A testing module is provided having units which can be ar ranged seriatim to provide narrow through passageways linked to each other for quantitative determination of analytes pass ing through the units as by electrical testing with electrodes. Auxiliary passageways are preferably used in one unit to allow flushing of a first sample chamber without contamination from a second sample chamber. An electrode holder carries a mem brane backed by a gel to aid in electrically linking the membrane to an electrode and to support the membrane in a substantially planar condition in use.
