# Capping mechanism for preventing nozzle blocking in an ink jet system printer.

## Abstract
An ink jet system printer includes a capping mechanism 10 for covering a printer head 8 when a carriage 7 is located at a stand by position 7B . The capping mechanism 10 includes a cap member 20 supported by a slidable plate 30 . The slidable plate 30 is shifted toward the printer head 8 as the printer head moves to the stand by position 7B through the use of links 32 , whereby the cap member 20 covers the nozzle portion included in the printer head 8 as the printer head moves to the stand by position 7B through the use of links 32 , whereby the cap member 20 covers the nozzle portion included in the printer head 8 . That is, the slidable plate 30 is shifted by the travelling force of the carriage and, therefore, a separate drive source is not required for the slidable plate 30 .
