## Description
The present invention relates to a thyristor device and particularly to a thyristor device providing a protection means which protects a thyristor from an external surge, such as is known from EP A 0 100 626. A device shown in Fig. 1 has been proposed as a thyristor device of this type. Fig. 1 is a block connection diagram indicating a thyristor device, in which numeral 1 denotes a thyristor, 2 is a protection element connected in parallel to the thyristor 1 through the connecting conductors 3, 4. Numeral 5 is an object to be controlled by the thyristor, and this control object 5 and thyristor 1 are connected through the connecting conductors 6, 7. Said protection element 2 forms so called a surge absorption circuit and is composed of an RC circuit and an avalanche diode as the non linear element. Particularly, if a control object is an inductive load such as a motor, a flywheel diode, for example, is used as the protection element. Moreover, a lead or cable having a constant current capacity is used as the connecting conductors 3, 4, 6 and 7. Operations of the device shown in Fig. 1 are explained. It is assumed that a surge or short circuit of control object 5 is generated when a lightning surge occurs or the switch is opened or closed. In this case, a surge voltage reaches the thyristor 1 through the connecting conductors 6, 7 from such control object 5 or from the control object 5 itself. Thereby, the protection circuit 2 absorbes such surge voltage in order to prevent breakdown of thyristor 1. The thyristor device of the prior art providing a protection device is constituted as explained above and therefore a problem has arised that a surge current coming from the side of control object 5 flows into the connecting conductors 3, 4 such as lead wire and cable which connects the thyristor 1 and protection device 2 resulting in a fear of causing inductive interference on the electrical circuits near these connecting conductors 3, 4 and thereby it is necessary to separately provide a measure to said electrical circuits in order to avoid such inductive interference. Moreover, this thyristor device has a disadvantage that the device as a whole including a thyristor 1, a protection circuit 2 and connecting conductors 3, 4, 6, and 7 occupies a large space. The present invention as claimed in claim 1 has solved said disadvantages of the prior art and therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a thyristor device which suppresses inductive interference by a surge current to an external circuits by reducing the conductors connecting the thyristor and protection circuit as much as possible and realizes reduction in size of device. Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detail description taken in conjunction with the preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a block diagram indicating the thyristor device of the prior art. Fig. 2 is a block diagram indicating the thyristor device of the preferred embodiment of the present invention. An preferred embodiment of the present invention is explained hereinafter. In Fig. 1, a reference numeral 11 is a flat type thyristor and two surfaces thereof form the electrodes. 12 is a protection element as the flat type protection device and two surfaces thereof form the electrodes. A thin copper or aluminum conductive plate 13 is held between the one electrode connected in common on the circuit of the thyristor 11 and protection element 12. 14 is a Operations of the above mentioned device are then explained. Even in such a thyristor device, if a surge voltage is supplied to the thyristor 11 from the side of control object 5, the protection element 12 absorbs such surge voltage through the conductive plate 13 in order to protect the thyristor 11. In addition, this conductive plate 13 may be formed as a thin conductive film. Therefore, the conductive plate 13 is an alternative of a long connecting conductor 4 shown in Fig. 1. However, it is very short in length and therefore it is not provided near the external circuits and does not have the function of antenna. Accordingly, it does not result in inductive interference due to the switching surge, etc. on the external circuits. The embodiment also assures the advantages that the space occupied by the device can be reduced and the device itself can also be formed small in size by omission of connecting conductor 4 of the prior art. In above embodiment, an existing connecting conductor 4 is eliminated and the conductive plate 13 is used. Moreover, it is also possible that a further space saving type small size thyristor device can be formed by eliminating the connecting conductor 3 and using the pressurizing material 14 itself as the conductive material. In this invention, the conductive plate connects the one electrode of thyristor and the one electrode protection device with a very short distance. Therefore, the conductive plate is no longer in contact with external circuits and thereby any inductive interference is not generated from this conductive plate to the external circuits. Since the electrodes are not connected with leads or cables, it is not required to provide extra space to the device and the thyristor device as a whole can be reduced in size.
