# Angular rate measuring device.

## Abstract
Three perpendicular axes define a spin axis z of a rotor 10 , a gimbal axis x of a gimbal 20 mounting the rotor, and an input axis y for angular rate to be measured. The rotor has opposed masses 17 which render it unsymmetric al, although statically and dynamically balanced. The gimbal is coupled to a support 30 by cantilever springs 40 . A pair of piezoelectric crystals 50,50 are mounted to one spring to sense angular movement between the gimbal and the support caused by torque applied about the gimbal axis by an oscillatory Coriolis force due to the input angular rate and the spinning unsymmetrical rotor. The gimbal coupling is tuned to twice rotor frequency to increase sensitivity to the Coriolis force. The device achieves reduction of certain gyroscopic instabilities, imbalances and errors, and is useful in navigation instruments.
