# ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE INTERLAYER FOR ELECTRICALLY ACTIVATABLE RECORDING ELEMENT

## Abstract
In an electrically activatable recording element including an electrically activatable recording layer improvements are provided by an electrically conductive interlayer ECI layer . The ECI layer separates the electrically activatable recording layer from the electrical activating means used to form a latent image in the recording layer. The ECI layer comprises electrically conductive particles uniformly dispersed in an electrically insulating binder. The interlayer enables imaging with increased sensitivity and a minimized air gap between the recording layer and electrical activating means.
