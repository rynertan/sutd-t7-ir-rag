# LINK BAR OPERATOR FOR ROTATING BLADE DAMPERS

## Abstract
An operator for rotating blade dampers including a frame and a plurality of interconnected blades adapted for rotation within the frame, which operator comprises a pair of pivotally interconnected members operatively associated with the blades of the damper and the damper frame, and an actuator for causing articulation between the operator members, thereby rotating the damper blades between a fully open and a fully closed position. A variety of actuators may be used, including cable type actuators as well as electrically and pneumatically operated actuators. The operator is configured so that the amount of rotation of the damper blades which is caused by a given amount of operation of the actuator increases as the damper blades move toward the open position, and so that an over center position is defined wherein the operator members are sub stantially longitudinally aligned and in which the blades of the damper are locked in position.
