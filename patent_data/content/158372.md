# Covering piece and material for therapeutic purposes.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a cover or shield for therapeutic purposes consisting of one or more layers of insulating ma terial in which at least two electrodes are embedded, which electrodes are interconnected through electrical conductors. If the cover or shield is positioned in close proximity parallel to a human or animal body it will form an equipotential sur face parallel to that body.

## Description
COVERING PIECE AND MATERIALIt is well known, that through different causes the human and animal body can show signs of lack of health. This can go with unfavourable tension of muscle groups and or disturbed circulation of blood in skin and underlying tissues.It is also known, that these symptoms can be relieved by balancing body surface tension between certain spots on the skin.Thus, European patent application 0107258 describes a garment or belt, provided with metallic electrodes, designed to be in direct physical contact with the skin, which electrodes are arranged so as to touch the acupuncture spots on the skin, and which electrodes are interconnected by means of conductive wires or strips.However, the use of uncovered electrodes poses some applicational restrictions. Thus, some people are allergic to direct contact with metal surfaces, such as copper, brass, aluminium and nickel.It has now been found, that the symptoms of ill health can also be relieved by means of a therapeutic shield or cover, consisting of one or more layers of insulating material, in which two or more electrodes are embedded, the electrodes being interconnected by means of an electric conductor, the shield or cover being designed in such a manner, that it may be positioned in close proximity substantially parallel to the body surface. It has appeared, that by means of this construction it is possible to establish an equipotential surface in the shield or cover without the use of any external source of electricity, which equipotential surface is substantially parallel to the body surface, whereby the symptoms of ill health are relieved. N I The terms shield1 or cover are used to denote generally any object intended to be for therapeutic purposes for some length of time in close proximity to the human or animal body, such as a single or multilayered piece of clothing, a facial mask, an inlay sole, a piece of furniture or a preformed or elastic cover for a piece of furniture. The material can be woven or knitted or made from so called stretch materials. It can also be made from plastic, rubber, leather, or similar materials.The term therapeutic purposes , apart from referring to the recovery of human or animal ailments, includes also the alleviation of bodily discomfort and the improvement of the feeling of well being, e.g. as a result of the disappearance of a feeling of tiredness, or nervous strain.The shield or cover according to the invention contains at least two electrodes, embedded in the sheet of elec . trically insulating material. The electrodes may be manufactured from sheet or gauze material. The gauze material can be braided or woven from wire, strip metal or multiple twisted wire. The sheet material can be provided with mechanical strengthening means on the side away from the body, with protrusions to fix the conductor to the layer of insulating material.The diameter of the electrode is usually about 1 cm, but it may be larger, e.g. 3 12 cm, depending on the intended use of the shield or cover. The electrodes may have the shape of e.g. a cross, a ring, a spiral or a wire wound as a spiral. The thickness of the material, from which the electrode is manufactured, depends on the strength and the flexibility required for the particular purpose.For sheet material this is for instance between 0,05 and 1,5 mm. In the case of a gauze material the space betweer the wires is not necessarily uniform.The electrodes may be connected by several parallel conductors. The material can be copper, brass or another well conductive material. If desired, electrodes and interconnecting conductors can be formed from one single sheet, for instance by means of punching.The position of the electrodes can be adapted to the size and the shape of the body, for which it is designed. The exact positioning of the electrodes can be based on research on the individual for which it is being designed, or on epidemological research.For more general applications the shield or cover according to the invention is of substantially fixed shape and dimensions. Special reinforcing material may be used to realize this effect, such as leather and hard PVC. It has been found that these articles are easy to manufacture, e.g. in mass production. Moreover, the electrical connection is independent of the frequency of use of the shield or cover.For most applications, the position of the electrodes is irregular and non periodic. However, the electrodes can also be placed in a mattress deck in a matrix of e.g. 15 by 15 cm, in rows, of 4 across and 5 in the length of the body.An example of a suitable embodiment of the invention is a bucket chair seat. In this case there are for instance five electrodes that have been put between two cloth layers. For instance there are two electrodes where the lower edge of the buttocks would be seated, each of them symmetrical to the middle of the buttock concerned. The third electrode will be positioned opposite the coccyx and be connected with the first and second. The fourth electrode will be opposite the connection of sacrum and fifth lunar vertebra, and is connected to the third electrode. The fifth electrode is situated between the first lumbar and the twelfth thoracic vertebra and is connected to the fourth electrode. The electrodes may have a diameter of 3 12 cm, preferably 5 10 cm. The chair seat can be executed as a loose cloth element, as a cover, or as an inlay. The chair seat can also be rigidly integrated with the electrodes in place, for instance in a bucket chair. The chair can also be designed as a bench or a carseat.It is known, that certain ailments find expression in certain characteristic features in e.g. the face, the palm of a hand, or the sole of a foot. For these reasons it is possible to analyse a photographic portrait, or a print of a hand or a foot to discover such characteristic features and then to design a cover or a shield according to the invention to remedy the shortcomings found in the analysis. For use in connection with a foot one will use an inlay sole provided with electrodes according to the invention for a face, a facial mask similarly designed, will provide the desired relief from the symptoms of the ailment. The electrodes used in an inlay sole or a facial mask usually have a diameter of approximately 1 cm.
