# Middle distillate fuel flow improver composition.

## Abstract
An additive composition for improving low temperature flow properties of a wax containing petroleum distillate fuel comprises A. an amorphous, normally solid, essentially saturated hydrocarbons fraction substantially free of normal paraffin hydrocarbons B. a wax modifying random copolymer of ethylene and an unsaturated ester and C. a fuel soluble liquid or solid ether. Examples of the components are A those obtained from deasphalting a residual petroleum fraction and removal of normal paraffins, B ethylene vinyl acetate and ethylene methyl methacrylate polymers, C an alkyl diphenyl ether in which the alkyl group is a dimerized C₁₆ alpha olefin. Preferred treat rates are from 0.15 to 0.75 wt based on the middle distillate fuel, particularly one boiling within the limits 120 C to 450 C.
