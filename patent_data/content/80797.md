# Metal racket frame.

## Abstract
A racket frame comprises a thin, elongated tubular metal member 12 of hollow oval cross section bent to form a head portion and a handle portion. The elongated tubular member is filled with a rigid foamed core 15 therein, thereby reducing the weight of the frame as well as vibration induced upon stroke.

## Description
METAL RACKET FRAME This invention relates to a frame of a racket for tennis, badminton etc., and particularly to those made of metals. Generally, rackets with metal tubular frames are constructed in two forms, oval shaped tubular structure and I beam with two tubular ends. As racket frames are principally designed for strength and stiffness, such metal frames usually cannot possess a minimum desired weight due to the characteristic of the materials.Additionally, when striking the ball, shock and vibration will be transmitted to the hand of the player, especially when the stroke point is not at the centre of the racket. Therefore the player will easily feel fatigued and sometimes even get hurt. The preferred form of metal racket frame to be employed in this invention is oval shaped tubular structure. It is proposed by the inventor after he made a test for rigidity of the above two structures. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic illustration with data of tests for rigidity in respect of the above two forms of frame, both of which have similar dimensions A, B,C and D as shown. During the tests, the handle portions thereof are supported fixedly and a load of 15 pounds is hung at the other free end of the frame. It is seen that the oval shaped tubular structure is bent such that the free end thereof deflects to a position having a distance of 20.2 mm from the original position, the cross sections being 152.4 mm and 304.8 mm distant from the free end deflect to a position 9.9 mm and 5.6 mm distant from the original position respectively.Similarly, the I beam frame makes a deflection that the free end, the cross sections being at 152.4 mm and 304.8 mm distant from the free end move to the positions 23.92 mm, 11.2 mm and 6.11 mm distant from the original positions. From these data it is seen that the oval shaped tubular frame has higher strength and rigidity than the other one. The object of the invention is further to improve the characteristics of the frame. A racket frame according to this invention comprises an elongated metal tubular member of hollow oval cross section bent to form a head portion and a handle portion, characterised in that the oval section metal tubular member includes an elongated rigid foamed core filled therein. In this way the wall thickness of the metal may be reduced, thereby reducing the weight of the frame. Furthermore, the foamed core reduces the vibration induced upon stroke. Advantageously, the oval section tubular member is made of aluminium alloy and the foamed core is formed of a foamable polyurethane based composition. This and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent in the following description of a preferred embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic illustration of prior arts showing some experimental data with respect to tests on rigidity for two kinds of frame Figure 2 is a perspective view of a frame constructed according to the present invention Figure 3 is a sectional view taken along the planeA A of Figure 2 and Figure 4 is a diagram comparing the vibrational condition of the frame according to the present invention and the oval section frame of the prior art. As shown in Figure 2, a racket frame 10 of the present invention comprises a thin, elongated metal tube of oval cross section bent to form a head portion 11 and a handle portion 12 of the frame This metal tube is made of aluminium alloy and the inside thereof is provided with a rigid foamed core 15 as shown inFigure 3. This rigid foamed core is formed by inserting a foamable polyurethane based composition into the tube, heating to a certain temperature, and allowing it to expand and cure. The formed frame 10 has an elongated metal shell 13 and a rigid foamed core 15 to reduce the weight of the frame. Thus, the wall thickness of an aluminium alloy frame may be reduced to from 0.70 to 1.05 mm, compared to the 1.1 mm wall thickness shown inFigure 1 as being commonly used in prior art frames. Due to the presence of the foamed core 15 the metal tubular frame 10 is also improved in that the vibration characteristic thereof becomes less when comparing with the metal frame without foamed core. Figures 4 b and a are the diagrammatic representations of the vibration of the frame 10 constructed according to the invention and the frame without foamed core. With the invention thus explained, it is apparent that obvious modifications and variations can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. It is therefore intended that the invention be limited only as indicated in the appended claims.
