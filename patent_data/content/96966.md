# AUTOMATIC CORRECTION CIRCUIT FOR RECEIVED DIGITALLY ENCODED SIGNALS

## Abstract
An automatic correction circuit is responsive to suitable bit patterns in a bit stream being received from a transmis sion medium, to generate an error amplitude map of signal distortion being introduced by the transmission medium. The error amplitude map is digitally stored or recorded. After each non zero bit occurrence in the signal stream a synchronized output signal corresponding to the recorded error amplitude map is generated and added to the bit stream being received to reduce signal distortion, whereby information recovery from the received bit stream is im proved.
