# Device and method for the quantitative determination of heparin in mammalian blood plasma and method for preparing the device.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a device for the quantitative determination of heparin in mammalian blood plasma, a method for the preparation of such device and a method for determining the plasma s heparin concentration using the device. The device, which is prepared using a freeze drying technique, compris es a first upper layer of a carrier matrix material containing a buffer, AT III and thrombin and a second, lower layer of a carrier matrix containing a thrombin sensitive fluorogenic or chromogenic substrate being capable of interacting with thrombin in such a manner that a time related chemical change detectable by fluorometric or spectrophotometric means takes place when thrombin and the substrate are contacted in a suitable liquid environment.
