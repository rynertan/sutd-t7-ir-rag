# Decoding device for a stream of code symbols which are word wise protected by a double Reed Solomon code with a minimum Hamming distance of 5 over the code symbols and an interleaving mechanism between the two codes, and also a player comprising such a decoding device.

## Abstract
For the decoding of a data stream which is word wise protected against errors by a double Reed Solomon code with symbol wise interleaving over the code words, first the reliability information for the constituent symbols is aggre gated for a code word. The strategy is determined therefrom, entailing the number of erase symbols and the maximum number of error symbols to be corrected. The correction re sult is compared with a reliability code and on the basis thereof all symbols obtain an at least trivalent secondary reliability indication for decoding in the second code.
