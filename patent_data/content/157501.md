# METHOD OF CONNECTING AN OPTICAL FIBER

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method for connecting an opti cal fiber using a connector formed by making three supporting rods 1,2,3 into a bundle. According to the invention the said rods 1,2,3 are bundled together by means of one or several elastic sleeves 4 , whereby when applying pressure to the connector from the direction of one supporting rod, the central opening 5 between the rods is made larger so as enable the insertion of the fibers 6 to be joined, and whereby the connec tion is locked when releasing the pressure. In the same manner it is also possible to undo the connection thus obtained, for example for servicing purposes.
