# Facsimile receiving apparatus and method of operation thereof.

## Abstract
A facsimile apparatus adapted to receive transmittend signals representing black, white and gradations of gray, has stylus drive circuitry with means 36 48 for producing a stylus control signal representative of the black, white and gray gradations of an image transmitting location. Further more, means 12V, 56, 60, 62 are provided for esta blishing a signal threshold level and means 64 94 are provided for generating a stylus drive signal substantially li nearly related to the stylus control signal when the control signal exhibits a step change at the threshold. In this way blished by the means 12V, 56, 60, 62 but which drive signal exhibits a step change at the thresold. In this way the apparatus can achieve varying degrees of grayness on a copy medium such as aluminized papers.
