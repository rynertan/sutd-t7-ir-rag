# COMBINATION PROCESS FOR UPGRADING CRUDE OIL INCLUDING DEMETALLIZING AND DECARBONIZING THEREOF

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with upgrading crude oil by zeolite catalytic cracking and particularly the residual portion of atmospheric distillation or that portion of crude oil boiling above about a middle distillate fraction after treatment by the combination of vacuum distillation, demetallizing and decar bonizing a vacuum resid portion with concentrated acid thereby concentrating metal contaminants in an asphalt pro duct thereof separated from a liquid product more suitable for catalytic upgrading with vacuum gas oil.
