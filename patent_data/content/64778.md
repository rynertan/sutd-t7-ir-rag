# Apparatus for shingling stack of flat articles.

## Abstract
Apparatus for taking a stack of flat articles such as folded newspapers, and delivering them successively to a conveyor 84 in an overlapped or shingled arrangement to move to a processing station for labelling or addressing or for opening them to receive inserts. A rectangular hopper or gate 24 is located over a travelling belt 16 to hold a stack of such flat articles with a converging angle pointing downstream. Each bottom article 72 is gripped by the belt which is subject to suction in the area under the stack, and is pulled under the gate 24 and downstream thereof. When a given article is only partially through the gate, the succeeding article is gripped primarily by its side portions and pulled under the gate in overlapping or shingled relation with the preceding one, each article being arranged with its side edges at a substantial angle to the direction of travel. A shield 26 underlies the rear portion of the stack to prevent gripping the rearmost portions of the articles until they are moving with the speed of the belt to prevent distortion or damage.
