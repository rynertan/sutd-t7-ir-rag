# APPARATUS FOR PROVIDING RADIATION OF CONTROLLED SPECTRAL COMPOSITION

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for providing radiation of controlled spectral composition, comprising radiation sources 51, ... 5n each emitting a quasi monochromatic radiation, a control unit 9 operating the radiation sources 51, ... 5n corresponding to a predeter mined spectral composition, and a dispersing element 1 irradiated by the radiation sources 51, ... 5n to produce the radiation of the predetermined spectral composition. In a preferred embodiment having no moving parts the radiation sources 51, ... 5n or outlet ends 71, ... 7n of fibre optic elements 61, ... 6n attached to them, the dispersing ele ment 1 e.g. a concave reflecting grating and an exit slit 2 for the radiation produced by the dispersing element 1 are in a fixed position with respect to each other, and the radia tion sources 51, ... 5n or the outlet ends 71, ... 7n of said fibre optic elements 61, ... 6n are located with respect to the dispersing element 1 so that they are imaged onto the exit slit 2 via the dispersing element 1 . The apparatus may be used as a double monochromator or a radiation synthetizer.
