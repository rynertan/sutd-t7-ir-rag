## Description
The invention is directed to a bit select circuit of a bipolar random access memory. Random access memories employing CTS type memory cells are known to the art. See for the example, the Gerbach Patent 3,863,229, the Dorler et al IBM TDB, Vol. 16, No. 12, May 1984 publication, and the Dorler et al IBM Journal of Research and Development Article A 1024 Byte ECL Random Access Memory Using a Complementary Transistor Switch CTS Cell , Vol. 25, No. 3, May 1981, pages 126 34. The known random access memories and the in particular those employing CTS memory cells have two relatively serious bit selection short comings. First, the bit decode transistor has to drive a number of bit columns across the chip. Due to long metal line and large fan out current, voltage drop along the bit decode line is high. The cells at the end of the bit decode line may have insufficient voltage across their 1 bit rail resistors to provide adequate gate currents into the cells. This may lead to potential data retention problems on the selected cells. Secondly, both selection and deselection of the bit rails are slow due to the fact that the bit decode transistor has large fan out loadings. Discharge speed of the bit rails is limited by the bit rail resistors. The bit selection scheme in accordance with the invention obviates the above recited shortcomings of known RAMS and in particular RAMs using CTS cells. In high performance arrays using cells like CTS, selection of a cell is accomplished by lowering its word lines and raising its bit rails. Known designs use a fixed current source to pull down the selected word lines. There are three problems usually associated with this method of word selection in current mode . Some solutions for those problems are given in The object of the invention is to provide a bit selection circuit of a bipolar random access memory to improve the speed of selection of bit lines. The solution of the object is summarized as improved bit selection circuitry for a RAM, in particular one using CTS Complementary Transistor Switch cells. The bit select circuitry includes interconnected first and second level matrix decoders, each memory column has a pair of bit lines, each pair of bit lines has connected thereto bit select circuit means, each of said bit select circuit means being connected to an output of said second level decoder, a bit up level clamp circuit connected to each of said bit select circuit means of each pair of bit lines, each of said bit select circuit means including first circuit means for increasing the speed of selection of the selected pair of bit lines, said bit up level clamp circuit cooperating with said bit select circuit means of said selected pair of bit lines for positively limiting the upper potential level of said selected pair of bit lines, and each of said bit select circuit means including second circuit means for increasing the speed of deselection of the selected pair of bit lines. The invention is set forth in claim 1. The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In high performance arrays using CTS cells, selection of a cell is done by lowering its word lines and raising its bit rails. As depicted in Figure 1, known designs use a fixed current source to pull down the selected word and drain lines. There are three problems frequently associated with the current mode method of word selection. The above problems are overcome and obviated by the voltage mode word selection technique as disclosed herein. Figure 8 shows the schematic diagram of this scheme. Also known high performance arrays using CTS cells have bit selection concerns or short comings. Again referring to Figure 1, these concerns are as follows The above problems and concerns are addressed and overcome by the random access memory disclosed hereinafter. The above problems are overcome by using distributive bit select circuits and word line selection circuits illustrated in Figures 3, 3A, 8 and 9. For purpose of illustration, Figure 2 shows a 1k x 4 RAM in accordance with the invention. This RAM has an array density of 4096 cells arranged in 64 words rows by 64 bit columns . The 64 bit columns are further divided into 4 data groups, so that it will write 4 bits therefore 4 data inputs and read 4 bits 4 data outputs at a time. The RAM has 6 word addresses to select 1 out of 64 rows and 4 bit addresses to select 4 out of 64 bits . Read and write operations are controlled by the RW input. Referring to Figure 3, a two level matrix decode scheme is employed for bit address decoding. The first level decode includes two groups of 4 address lines BA0 BA3 and BA4 BA7 formed from output emitter dotting of the four bit address receivers. The bit address receivers are current switch emitter follower circuits as shown in Figure 4. They convert the address inputs to true and complement signals. By means of emitter follower output dotting of the address receiver pairs, a partial decode of 1 out of 4 is formed from each group, hence, giving a total of two selected low level lines. The second level decode function is performed by the 16 bit decoders Figure 5 , which have current switch inputs and high speed push pull outputs. Input 1 of the bit decoder is connected to one of the 4 lines in BA0 BA3 address group, and input 2 is connected to one in the BA4 BA7 group. Of the 16 BD output lines, only one is decoded to a selected up level. Each BD line fans out to drive four bit columns one from each data group , so that four cells are selected at a time for READ or WRITE operation. Each bit column has a bit select circuit Figures 3 and 6 to perform bit line select and deselect functions. The selected bit lines up level is set by a bit up level clamp circuit Bit UPCL, Figure 7 , so that the cells read and write operating points can be readily adjusted by changing the up clamp UC level. The bit select circuit s modes of operation are described below. In an unselected state, the BD line is held low by its corresponding bit decoder to a voltage close to V When a bit column is selected, its BD line is actively pulled up by the corresponding bit decoder to a voltage about a V During a READ operation, both PDL and PDR lines are high at around V In the selected state, since the BD line s voltage level is higher than node 1, diode T4 as well as Schottky D1 and D2 are OFF. No current will flow into or out of the BD line, hence no voltage drop will exist along this line as compared with prior designs . Furthermore, the selected cell s read currents are sourced directly from V In the WRITE mode, bit lines selection is similar to that of the READ mode as described above. The only difference here is that one of the WRITE control lines either PDL or PDR, depending on the data to be written is driven negative to a voltage close to V During WRITE mode, node 1 s up level is also clamped by diode T3 to a voltage set by the UC line. The write reference voltage is typically 600 800 mV above the READ reference voltage, so that sufficient write current is always guaranteed to ensure fast write performance. As in READ mode, the write current is also sourced directly from V When a bit column is not selected, its corresponding bit decoder output falls to a low level. Node 1 of the bit select circuit is pulled negative by diode T4 to turn OFF T1 and T2. The bit lines, at the same time, are also pulled down actively by Schottky diodes D1 and D2 and will discharge into the BD line. After the bit lines are fully discharged to unselected down level, D1 and D2 will stop conducting. The bit column is said to be in an unselected state. The disclosed bit select scheme has particular utility in arrays using CTS Complementary Transistor Switch, Figure 1A cells. With this scheme, at least the following two advantages have been achieved over the known designs. The improved bit selection circuit means, in accordance with the invention includes the following elements The improved word line decoder and control circuitry represented by the block labelled Word Decode in Figure 3 is shown in detail in Figures 8 and 9. Figure 8 shows the voltage mode word selection scheme whereas Figure 9 discloses in detail the circuit of the word decoder. Referring to Figure 8, there are 6 word addresses to decode 1 out of 64 rows. A two level matrix decode scheme similar to that of the bit path is employed for word address decoding. The first level decode includes three groups of 4 address lines WA4 WA3, WA0 WA7, and WA8 WA11 formed from output emitter dotting of the 6 word address receivers. The word address receivers are current switch emitter follower circuits Figure 4 . They convert the address inputs to true and complement signals. By means of emitter follower output dotting of the address receiver pairs, a partial decode of 1 out of 4 is obtained from each group, hence giving a total of three selected low level lines. The second level decode function is performed by the 64 word decoders Figure 9 . Each word decoder has three current switch inputs IN1 IN3 and two high speed high power push pull outputs WL and DL . IN1 of the word decoder is connected to one of the four lines in WA0 WA3 address group. IN2 is connected to one in the second group WA4 WA7 , and IN3 is connected to one in the third group WA8 WA11 . All these three inputs have to be low in order to select a row line. The two outputs of the word decoder are connected to the word line WL and drain line DL of the memory cells as shown. Operations of the word decoder, in accordance with the invention, are explained hereinafter. An unselected word decoder will have at least one of its three inputs high. Decoding transistors T5, T6 or T7 are turned ON to pull down node 1. Transistors T9 and T10 form a dual phase level shifter, so that node 4 is also pulled negative to a voltage close to V To enable fast switching speed, transistors T9 and T10 are never shut OFF but kept in slight conduction. The active pull up devices T11 and T When a word decoder is selected, all its three inputs are low. Transistors T5, T6 and T7 are OFF. Node 1 goes high to turn ON T9 and T10 hard. Node 3 is pulled down by T9 s collector to keep T11 T When the word and drain lines are fully selected, T11 T Since the selected drain line is pulled down by a high power open collector transistor T After a row line has been selected for a READ or a WRITE operation, it is deselected back to its stand by state. A deselecting word decoder will have at least one of its inputs go positive. Decoding transistors T5, T6 or T7 are turned ON again, driving node 1 down to shut OFF the open collector transistor T A cell is selected for the READ operation when its row lines WL, DL and bit lines BL, BR are both selected Figure 12 . The row lines are selected by the voltage mode word selection scheme as previously described. The bit lines are selected by the bit selection scheme explained earlier Figure 3 . After a cell is fully selected, read currents I With voltage mode word selection technique, WRITE operation is performed in three sequential steps Figures 13 and 14 . As in READ operation, the magnitude of write current I The above write scheme is denoted Differential Mode Write , since one side of the bit line is raised high while the other side is being held low during write time. The key advantage of this write scheme is that since the drain line is selected to a fixed voltage a V As is submitted to be evident from the above description the use of the voltage mode word selection technique, in accordance with the invention, particularly in CTS RAMs, provides the following benefit and advantages The proper operation of a voltage mode word selection scheme in a CTS RAM requires a bit up level clamp circuit to define the selected cells operating levels. This is particularly important for the READ operation. A read reference voltage is generated by the bit up level clamp to track with the selected cells in temperature, power supply V Referring to Figure 12, the voltage level required at the emitter of the clamping diode T12 in READ mode can be determined by summing up the potential rises falls from V Cancelling the V Equating expressions 1 and 2 , we have V 1 is the voltage across the 1 side of the bit rail resistor. It is this voltage potential across RBL that defines the gate current I and V 0 V 1 V Furthermore, temperature effects on the devices are also equally cancelled out. In a WRITE mode the R W input is low. Transistor T15 is OFF and T16 is ON. Node 1 is high to pull up T17 while node 3 is down to shut OFF T12. The WRITE reference level at the UC line is given by The operation of circuitry represented in Figure 3 by the block labelled sensing circuitry will now be explained with particular reference to Figures 10 and 11. Figure 3A illustrates the sensing scheme employed for the RAM shown in Figure 2. The 64 bit columns of this RAM is divided into four data groups of 16 bits. Each data group contains a sense amplifier Figure 10 for READ sensing. The state of the sense amplifier is determined by the selected cell within its data group. Data read by the sense amplifier is sent off chip through an off chip driver OCD circuit. Figure 11 illustrates the sense amplifier arrangement for a data group. Within a data group, each bit column has a pair of sensing transistors TL and TR attached to its bit lines for voltage sensing. When a cell is selected for READ, its row lines WL and DL are pulled down by its corresponding word decoder, and its bit lines BL and BR are raised up by its bit select circuit. Since there are 16 bit columns per data group, bit selection is always 1 out of 16. Of the thirty two bit lines, only two are up at any one time. The higher of these two selected bit lines turns on the corresponding sensing transistor in the sense amplifier circuit. Figure 10 illustrates a high speed sense amplifier circuit designed for the above sensing scheme. The circuit uses current steering technique to enable very fast switching performance. Its sensing speed is independent of the number of bit columns in the data group. Referring to Figure 10, the thirty two sensing transistors TL1 to TL16 and TR1 to TR16 form a big current switch input for the sense amplifier. The bases of these transistors are connected to the sixteen bit columns in the data group. Transistors T18 and T19 are emitter followers providing dual phase outputs to drive the off chip driver. Transistors T20 and T21 are set to be ON all the time to define a fixed voltage at nodes A and B, so that switching of these two devices is done in current mode. At any time, either bit left or bit right of a selected bit column is up at a high voltage level. The higher voltage bit line turns on its corresponding sensing transistor. The sense current I Since voltage levels at node A and B will never be switched but remain fixed, any capacitance at these nodes, therefore will have no effect on the switching time. In fact, the circuit s delay will stay constant, disregarding the number of sensing transistors attached to its input stage. Furthermore, transistors T18, T19 and T20, T21 are active all the time hence, their switching delay is kept to a minimum. The features of the sense amplifier circuit in Figure 10 are summarized as follows
