# Pressure sensitive recording material and process for its production, coating composition, capsules and microcapsules therefor.

## Abstract
A self contained pressure sensitive record material car ries a coating composition comprising both pressure rupturable capsules containing a solution of a substantially colourless chromogenic compound and pressure rupturable capsules containing a solid acidic resin which reacts with said chromogenic compound on contact therewith to form a col oured image forming compound. The composition is applied to the substrate in a single coating step. The resulting record material affords good imaging characteristics and a low degree of print bleed.
