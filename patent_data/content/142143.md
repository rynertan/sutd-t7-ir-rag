# Process for the production of polyethylene compositions.

## Abstract
A process for producing a polyethylene composition which comprises polymerizing ethylene in the presence of a catalyst comprising A a contact treatment product of a a high activity catalyst component and b a filler, and B an organoaluminum compound. This process has no need for an deashing step. i.e., a step to remove the catalyst after polymerization, since the catalyst has a remakably high activity. In the polyethylene composition produced, the filler is dispersed uniformly and the separation of the filler from the polyethylene is scarcely observed.
