# Enhanced selectivity signal receiver.

## Abstract
A receiver which has a plurality of inter connected stages 10, 20 and a demodulator 22 , and where there appears at its input a desired signal which occupies substan tially a predetermined bandwidth, and at least one undesired signal which occupies a bandwidth different from, though partially overlapping the predetermined bandwidth, a signal selector 71, 48, 30, 76, 78, 80, 82, 83 coupled to receiver terminals 18, 28 upstream of the receiver demodulator 22 for selecting the undesired signal so as to substantially isolate it from any other signals, a gain controlled feedback stage 32, 35, 37 connected with one input thereof to an output of the signal selector 71, 48, 30, 76, 80, 83 for negatively feeding back the undesired signal to the receiver terminals 18, 28 , and a comparator 40, 41 for comparing a predetermined level of the undesired signal with a reference level so as to control the undesired signal fed back to the receiver terminals 18, 28 is characterized by the signal selector 71, 48, 30, 76, 78, 80, 82, 83 normally continuously selecting the signal appearing across the receiver terminals 18, 28 , by the comparator generating an error control signal feeding a continuously variable gain controlling input of the gain controlled feedback stage 32, 35, 37 , by the predeter mined level being the output level of a frequency dependent selection device 30, 48 included in the signal selector, and by the reference level 42 being settable over a wide and non critical range, so as to force any remnants of the undesired signal still appearing at the input of the demodula tor 22 to assume a controlled level below a level of the desired signal thereat.
