## Description
Anti caking agent, a process for its production and its use The present invention relates to an agent for the treatment of products which tend to cake, particularly for the treatment of fertilizers, in order to make these products free flowing and non dusting. More particularly the invention relates to such an agent which comprises both an inorganic powder material and organic compounds and which agent is in the form of prills, granules or the like. The t invention also relates to. a process for the production of the agent and to the use of the agent for anti caking treat ment of fertilizers. It is well known to treat salts and fertilizers containing water soluble salts to prevent them from caking during storage, transport and handling. Anti caking treatment can be carried out either with solid or liquid agents and in one or several steps. Different types of organic surface active compounds, such as fatty amines, salts of fatty amines, sulphonates etc. have since long been used for anti caking. treatment. Further, inorganic powder materials, such as talcum, lime and clay, have been used to a great extent, as they are advantageous from an economical point of view. The inorganic materials are generally used in combination with organic surface active compounds. However, one disadvantage in using powders is that they often give rise to serious dusting problems. According to the present invention it has been found that an agent having extremely satisfactory anti caking effect and which does not give rise to annoying dusting problems is obtained by a combination of inorganic powder material, wax and mixtures of fatty amines and fatty acids, which composition is in the form of prills or granules. The inorganic powder in the present anti caking agents is completely mixed into the organic phase and the composition is converted into particle form, e.g. to prills or granules, by means of a special treatment step. The present anti caking agents are non dusting in themselves, and can be handled, transported and applied without dust problems.Products with a tendency to caking have a very low tendency to dusting after having been treated with the present agents. The agents according to the invention contain 20 60 per cent by weight of an inorganic powder material, 20 60 per cent by weight of a mixture of a cat ironic fatty amine and a fatty acid, whereby the mole ratio of amine to fatty acid is within the range 80 20 to 30 70, 10 35 per cent by weight of a wax and 0 20 per cent of a fatty amide. By the above given combination of specific components in specific amounts an agent is obtained which gives surprisingly good anti cakingeffect, and products treated with the agents have a considerably reduced tendency to dusting. compoilents and their amounts make a complete mixing of the inorganic material into the organic phase possible, and makes a conversion of the composition to particle form possible. The agent is solid at room temperature and, owing to the complete mixing of the inorganic material into the organic phase, the agent has a very good stability to decomposition. Any known powder material can be used in the present agent, e.g. kieselguhr, talcum, clays or mixtures thereof.The particle size of the powder material is not of a critical importance. It is, however, suitable that 50 per cent of the material has a diameter below 110 40,um and preferably 50 per cent of the material has a diameter below 20 sum. A high content of inorganic material is, of course, preferable from an economical point of view. Too high contents may, however, give problems at the production of the agents, reduce their storage stability and cause dusting and the content should thus not exceed 60 per cent by weight. The content should be within the range 20 to 60 per cent by weight and preferably within the range 35 to 50 per cent by weight, based on the total composition. A mixture of amine and fatty acid is present in the agents in amounts of 20 to 60 and preferably 30 to 35 per cent by weight. The amines are monoamines or diamines of the general formula RNH2 or RNH CH2 nNH2 wherein R is an aliphatic, hydrophobic, hydrocarbon group having at least 12 carbon atoms, suitably 12 to 24, and preferably 16 to 20 carbon atoms, and n is an integer of 1 to 5, preferably 2.The hydrophobic group can be straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated. It is preferred that R is an alkyl group and monoamines of the above given formula are preferred to the diamines. As exemples of suitable amines can be mentioned tetradecylamine, hexadecylamine, octadecylamine and eicosylamine. Particularly suitable are the commercial amines which are mixtures of amines having varying carbon chain lengths and which are obtained from different animal and vegetable fats and oils, for example from tallow. The fatty acids in the agents contain an aliphatic, hydrophobic.group having at least 6 carbon atoms, suitably 6 to 24 and preferably 14 to 22 carbon atoms. The hydrophobic group can be straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated. Saturated fatty acids are preferred. As examples of suitable fatty acids can be mentioned. lauric acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid.. Mixtures of amines and fatty acids as above are present in the anti caking agents of the invention and the mole ratio of amine to fatty acid is within the range 80 20 to 30 70. It is preferred to use about equimolar amounts of amine and fatty acid, or to have only a minor excess of amine or fatty acid, and the mole ratio is thus suitably within the range 70 30 to 40 60 and preferably within the range 60 4Q to 40 60. When the term mixture of amine and fatty acid is used herein it should be understood that these to a certain extent, depending on the molecular ratio, are present in salt form. The term mixture thus also includes fatty acid salts of amines, and optional excess of one or the other of the components.. The agents contain 10 to 35, and preferably 10 to 25 per cent by weight of a wax. As wax material it is possible to use polyolefins, such as polyethylene, natural or synthetis paraffin waxes, microcrystalline waxes and mixtures of such waxes. The waxes can be oxidized or modified. Part of the wax can also be replaced by fatty amides, i.e. amides of the general formula RCONH2, which contain a hydrophobic group corresponding to those defined for the amines in the agents. Amides can hereby be present in a weight ratio of up to 2 1 with respect to the wax.The wax should suitably have a melting point below 120 0C. The wax is selected with respect to suitable viscosity at the following conversion of the total composition into prills or granules and with respect to the required melting point for the total composition, at the treatment of the products which tend to cake. The agents according to the invention can be prepared by mixing the components at a temperature above the melting point of the organic compounds in order to obtain an intimate, molten down, mixture of these and the inorganic material. When the components are warmed, a salt is generally formed of the amine and the fatty acid. The obtained mixture is then converted to a particulate form, e.g. to granules, prills or pellets, and this can e.g. be carried out by treatment in a granulator or spraying in a cooling tower for the formation of prills. At the blending of the components, coloring agents or fluorescent agents can, if desired, be introduced into the anti caking agents. The obtained particulate anti caking agent should suitably have a diameter exceeding 0.4 mm. The diameter should not be greater than 4 mm. The agents according t o the invention ar.e maiRly used for treatment of fertilizers. Treatment of fertilizers with anti caking agents according to the invention is suitably carried out at a temperature above the melting point of the agents and the agents are suitably applied to warm fertilizers to melt out on these, and this could e.g. be carried outin a drum. It is of course also possible to apply the agents in other manners, it is e.g. possible to cover the inner side of the treating drum, into which the fertilizer is introduced, with molten anti caking agent. The amount of anti caking agent required to obtain a satisfactory effect will, of course, vary with the composition of the fertilizers and their tendency to caking. Amounts within the range 0.03 to 0.4 per cent by weight, based on the fertilizer, can for example be used.Amounts within the range of 0.08 to 0.20 per cent by weight are used in most cases. Fertilizers, and other salts, treated with the agents of the invention have improved storage capability and reduced tendency to dusting, and, at the same time, the agents themselves do not give rise to dusting and they can, owing to their specific form, be handled and metered out in a simple manner. The invention also relates to a process for the production of the agents and to the use of the agents, in accordance with what has been said above and as defined in the claims. The invention is further illustrated in the following examples which, however, are not intended to limit the same.Parts and per cent relate to parts by weight and per cent.by weight respectively, unless otherwise stated.Example 1 A mixture of 21 per cent by weight of fatty amine having a carbon chain length of C16 l8, 24 per cent by weight of technical stearic acid and 25 per cent by weight of polyethylene wax was melted in a reactor at 90 0C during vigorous stirring. 30 per cent by weight of talcum were then added at continued stirring and the obtained mixture was sprayed in 0 a cooling tower at 90or. The droplets became solidified dur ing the free fall and prills having the following particle size distribution were obtained 2 4 mm 7 , 1 2 mm 78 , 0.63 1 mm 13 , C 0.63 mm 2 . Example 2 2000 grams of NPK 15 15 15 in the form of granules were warmed to 850C in a rotating bowl, whereafter 0.15 of anti caking agent, based on the fertilizer, were added.The rotation was continued at a constant temperature for 10 minutes and the anti caking agent did hereby melt out completely and covered the fertilizers granules with a thin layer. The treated fertilizer was thereafter subjected to an accelerated storage test for 68 hours with programmed temperature variations between 35 and 380c at a relative humidity corresponding to the CRH of the fertilizer under a pressure of 150 kPa, which corresponds to a storage height of about 15 m. After storage the crush force, which is a direct measure of the caking tendency, was determined. The tendency to dusting of the treated fertilizer was determined by rotation of a sample of this in a drum for two minutes. The treatment was carried out with different anti cak ing agents according to the invention in the form of small prills. In all agents talcum was the inorganic powder material, the fatty acid was a technical stearic acids the amine had a carbon chain length of C16 18 and the wax was polyethylene wax.The composition of the agents were as follows a 45 amine fatty acid mixture with a mole ratio of 70 30, 15 wax, 40 talcum b 40 amine fatty acid mixture with a mole ratio of 70 30, 20 wax, 40 talcum c 35 amine fatty acid mixture with a mole ratio of 70 30, 25 wax, 40 talcum d 45 amine fatty acid mixture with a mole ratio of 50 50, 15 wax, 40 talcum e 40 amine fatty acid mixture with a mole ratio of 50 50, 20 wax, 40 g talcum f 35 amine fatty acid mixture with a mole ratio of 50 505 25 wax, 40 talcum g 30 amine fatty acid mixture with a mole ratio of 50 50, 10 fatty amine, 20 wax, 40 talcum The results are shown in the table below.
