# Digital display for dictation transcriber.

## Abstract
A display for a record playback apparatus where the record medium includes end and instruction indicia signals recorded thereon, of which the end signals delimit segments of dictation on the medium, including displays for the time remaining in the present segment, the number of segments yet to be reached going in the forward direction 11 , the number of instruction indicia signals within the present segment 12 and the playback time remaining until the next instruction signal is reached. A counter 31 counts the end signals and also provides an address to an addressable memory 30 in which the number of instruction signals counted by a second counter 29 is stored. During move ment of the record medium in a forward direction, the number stored in the addressable memory 30 are loaded back into the counter 29 . The time remaining until next indicia signal segments are controlled by up down counters which count pulses corresponding to movement of incre ments of the record medium past a transducer. The contents of the counters are written into and read out of addressable memories during movement of the record medium. Also shown is apparatus which latches an advance signal which will fast wind the record medium in a particular direction until it is within a predetermined distance of the next indicia signal as detected by a comparator. Also shown is a counter which may be preset to skip a particular number of the indicia signals until the advance signal is removed.
