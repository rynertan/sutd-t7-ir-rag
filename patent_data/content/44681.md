# Annular fluid seals.

## Abstract
A face seal arrangement for effecting a fluid seal between a housing 12 and a shaft 13 rotatable therein and comprising a sleeve like diaphragm 15 interposed between an annular shell 14 and a sealing member 16 has a compression spring 17 of rectangular section material loading the diaphragm 15 outwardly relative to the shell 14 , the spring 17 being disposed between radial flanges 18 of the diaphragm. Each flange 18 has a tapered rim 26 at its axially outer face, the rims 26 being engaged in seatings 23, 33 in the shell 14 and sealing member 16 respectively. The arrangement is a unitized structure in that the sealing ring 36 is held captive relative to the shell 14 with the spring loaded sealing member 16 interposed therebetween and freely movable in the axial direction of the arrangement.
