# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TREATING CROPS IN ROWS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for treating crops in rows to destroy weeds in and adjacent to the crop rows. First and second probes 15, 16 are provided, preferably connected up to a high voltage source of electricity, and mounted so that they extend into crop row from opposite sides thereof. A frame mechanism 12 mounted for movement in a given direction is provided, and the probe mounting structures 20 are pivotally mounted to the frame mechanism 12 for movement about a vertical axis with respect to the frame mechanism. The probe mounting devices 20 are operatively tied together by a turnbuckle assembly 44 or the like, so that the probes 15, 16 will move with each about their respective vertical axes and engage crops in the rows, the crops center ing the probes. The probes 15, 16 are also mounted for pivotal movement about a horizontal axis B B so that they will move out of the way of unyielding obstructions they might encounter. Third and fourth probes 50, 51 also are preferably provided horizontally spaced from the first and second probes 15, 16 , and mounted so that they contact all plants on either side of the crop rows, and after contacting of the plants therewith is terminated the first and second probes 15, 16 contact all of the plants in and around the crop rows. The first and second probes 15, 16 slant backwardly from the frame mechanism 12 , opposite the given direction of movement, while the third and fourth probes 50, 51 are generally perpendicular to the given direction of movement.
