# HUMAN NONSECRETORY PLASMACYTOID CELL LINE

## Abstract
A human non secretory plasmacytoid continuous cell line, established for five years in more than 150 passages, is karyotypically normal, easily grown and has the characteris tic features of a plasmablast excepting for its secretory defect, and can be used for the preparation of human human hybridomas with human B lymphocytes and separation of the resulting hybridomas from the plasmacytoma cell line by growth in COâ‚‚ containing media, or by fluorescence acti vated cell sorting, or both.
