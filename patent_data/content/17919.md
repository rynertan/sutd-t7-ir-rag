# Diffused resistor.

## Abstract
A diffused resistor for an integrated circuit comprising two resistor portions 21, 22 . Each of the resistor portions comprises a semiconductor substrate 23 of a first conducti vity type, an isolated epitaxial region 25, 30 of a second con ductivity type, a diffused region 27, 31 i.e. a resistance layer of the first conductivity type, a contacting region 28, 32 of the second conductivity type and terminals 35, 36, 37, 38 . An end portion of the resistance layer 27 in one 21 of the resistor portions 21, 22 is connected to one of the ends of the resi stance layer 31 in the other resistor portion 22 so that these resistance layers 27, 31 combine into a resistor. In the other resistor portion 22 the other end portion of the resistance layer 31 is connected to the contacting region 32 . Depletion layers generated in the resistor portions 21, 22 vary so as to maintain the resistance of the diffused resistor constant.
