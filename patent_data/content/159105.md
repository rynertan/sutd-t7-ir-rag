# A FLUID LEVEL CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
An axial housing 16 contains a differential 25 and a hydraulic actuator 24 controlling a clutch for locking and unlocking the differential. Actuating fluid for the actuator 24 is pumped from a main transmission housing 12 by a pump 22 . The axial housing 16 is part full of cooling lubricant but the actuator 24 tends to leak and cause the fluid level to rise. In order to provide for simple return of excess fluid to the transmission housing 12 through a return line 20 , having an opening 30 at a suitable level in the axial housing, this housing is pressurized by connection to a turbocharger 34 for the vehicle engine 35 . A flow restrict ing orifice 36 allows enough pressure to be created in the axial housing 16 without significantly reducing the tur bocharger efficiency.
