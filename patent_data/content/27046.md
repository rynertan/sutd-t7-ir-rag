# Magnetic brush apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic brush apparatus which minimizes the escape of toner and or carrier particles by means of a magnetic field shaping device which minimizes the pre sence of magnetic lines of force projecting axially outward from the ends of the magnets 34 positioned within the magnetic brush roller. Examples of magnetic field shaping devices are a piece of ferro magnetic material 54 and or a magnetic field shaping magnet 48 , placed axially adjacent the end of at least one of the magnets, either with or without an intervening air gap 50 or a piece of non magnetizable material.
