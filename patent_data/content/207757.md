# Continuously variable transmission oil pressure control system.

## Abstract
A control system for a continuously variable transmis sion has a spool valve 40 for controlling the line pressure of oil supplied to a cylinder 9 of a drive pulley 7 . A hydraulic circuit is provided for supplying oil to a port 41a of the line pressure control valve 40 so as to shift the spool 42 . A pressure reducing valve 60 is provided in the hydraulic circuit for keeping the pressure in the circuit constant and a control valve 65 is provided in the hydraulic circuit so as to control the quantity of the constant pressure oil supplied to the end of the spool 42 .
