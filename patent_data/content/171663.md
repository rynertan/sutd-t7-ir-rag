# Field directed screen help technique.

## Abstract
A field directed screen help technique for a data entry system responds to a user request for help by overwriting a portion of the data entry screen with explanatory text that relates to the field the user is currently entering. The explanatory text may overlay other fields on the screen but leaves the related field area in view. The explanatory text is highlighted and linked to the data entry field so that the user can see the explanatory text in the context of the field. The explanatory text disappears when the user presses a re sponse key.
