# Etching method.

## Abstract
Materials whose elemental constituents are selected from groups III and V of the Periodic Table are photochemically etched in a reducing environment. Etching is carried out by il luminating a halogenated hydrocarbon gas, eg methyl iodide, with ultra violet light in the vicinity of the material. The reduc ing environment is provided by the presence of sufficient hydrogen to suppress the effect of any oxygen leaking into the system. Methods according to the invention may be used in par ticular in the production of opto electronic devices.
