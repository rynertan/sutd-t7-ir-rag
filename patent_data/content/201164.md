## Description
This invention relates to graft polymers, more especially, graft polymers derived from oil soluble linear carbon carbon backbone polymers grafted on which are units derived from a functional monomer obtained by reacting an unsaturated aldehyde or ketone with an amine having at least one nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring. These graft polymers are suitable as additives for hydrocarbons, including hydrocarbon lubricating oils, and provide improved properties for such hydrocarbons. As is well known to those skilled in the art, hydrocarbon fuels and lubricating oils must be formulated, e.g. by addition of various additives, so as to improve their properties. It is found that lubricating oils, such as those employed in railway, automotive, aircraft or marine service, become degraded during use, due A viscosity index improver and dispersant additive with an oxidized degraded copolymer of ethylene and propylene as a backbone for a vinyl ester of a saturated carboxylic acid, an N vinyl lactam or an N oxohydrocarbon are taught in GB A 1244 435. US A 3872 019 teaches the use of an oil additive which comprises an ethylene propylene backbone polymer grafted with a formaldehyde reactant and a primary or secondary aliphatic amine. It is an object of this invention to provide a new additive system which can be incorporated into hydrocarbon lubricating compositions. In one embodiment, this invention provides a graft polymer comprising an oil soluble, substantially linear, carbon carbon backbone polymer having graft polymerized thereon units derived from a functional monomer which is the reaction product of i an ethylenically unsaturated aldehyde or ketone, and ii a primary or secondary amine which contains at least one nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, with the proviso that the monomer is not the reaction product of crotonaldehyde and N 3 aminopropyl morpholine which has been functionalized with phenothiazine if the backbone polymer is an ethylene propylene copolymer. This invention also provides a process for the production of such graft polymers, and hydrocarbon compositions containing such graft polymers as additives. The charge polymer which may be employed as the graft base in the process of this invention is an oil soluble, substantially linear, carbon carbon backbone polymer. Typical polymers prepared from monomers bearing an ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable double bond which may be employed include homopolymers or copolymers prepared from monomers containing the groupings wherein A may be, for example, hydrogen hydrocarbon such as alkyl or aryl carboxy, or derivatives thereof or halogen. R may be a single bond or a divalent hydrocarbon group, typified by alkylene, alkarylene, aralkylene, cycloalkylene or arylene. Illustrative of such monomers are acrylates methacrylates vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride styrene olefins such as ethylene, propylene or butylene and dienes such as butadiene, isoprene, hexadiene or ethylidene norbornene . Although homopolymers of olefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene or polyisobutylene , or copolymers or ethylene with e.g. butylene and higher olefins may be employed, the preferred carbon carbon backbone polymers include ethylene propylene copolymers EPM or EPR and ethylene propylene diene terpolymers EPDM or EPT .

The EPM and EPT polymers may contain minor portions typically less than 30 of other units derived from other copolymerizable monomers. In the process of this invention, there are grafted onto these oil soluble, substantially linear carbon carbon, backbone polymers, graft units derived functional units derived from the reaction product of i an ethylenically unsaturated aldehyde or ketone, and ii a primary or secondary amine which contains at least one nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring. The carbonyl compounds aldehydes or ketones which may be used according to this invention may have the formula wherein R¹ and R², which can be the same or different, are unsubstituted or inertly substituted hydrocarbyl, or R¹ can be hydrogen, but at least one of R¹ and R² is ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbyl, or R¹ and R², together with the carbonyl group represent the atoms necessary to complete a cycloalkenone ring. Unsubstituted or inertly substituted hydrocarbyl can be alkyl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or alkenyl. When R¹ is alkyl, it may typically be methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, i butyl, sec butyl, amyl, octyl, decyl or octadecyl. When R¹ is aralkyl, it may be benzyl or beta phenylethyl. When R¹ is cycloalkyl it may be cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, 2 methylcycloheptyl, 3 butylcyclohexyl or 3 methylcyclohexyl. When R¹ is aryl, it may be phenyl or naphthyl. When R¹ is alkaryl, it may be tolyl or xylyl. When R¹ is alkenyl, it may be vinyl, allyl or 1 butenyl. R¹ may be inertly substituted, i.e. it may bear a non reactive substituent such as alkyl, aryl or cycloalkyl. Typically inertly substituted R¹ groups include 3 chloropropyl, 2 ethoxyethyl, carboethoxymethyl or 4 methyl cyclohexyl. The preferred R¹ groups are lower alkenyl, i.e. C₂ C₁₀ alkenyl, e.g. ethenyl, n propenyl or preferably butenyl. R² may have the same meaning as R¹, excluding hydrogen, or R¹ and R² may, together with the carbonyl group form an unsaturated cycloalkenone group, e.g. cyclohexenone. At least one of R¹ and R² is an ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbon. The ethylenically unsaturated carbonyl compound is a ketone or, more preferably, an aldehyde.

In the process of this invention, 100 parts by weight of charge EPM or EPT may be added to 100 to 1000 parts by weight, e.g. 300 parts by weight of solvent. Typical solvents are hydrocarbon solvent such as n hexane or n heptane, tetrahydrofuran, or mineral oil. A preferred solvent is commercial hexane containing principally n hexane isomers. The reaction mixture may then be heated e.g. to a temperature of 60 to 180 The functional monomer, which is to serve as grafting monomer, is added, preferably in an amount of 1 to 40 parts by weight, e.g. 10 parts by weight, followed by a solution in hydrocarbon of a free radical initiator. Typical free radical initiators include dicumyl peroxide, di t butyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, di isopropyl peroxide, and azobisisobutyronitrile. The solvent is preferably the same as that in which the EPM or EPT is dissolved. The initiator may preferably be added in an amount of 0.2 to 10 parts by weight, e.g. 4 parts by weight in 0.8 to 40 parts by weight, e.g. 16 parts by weight of solvent. The free radical initiator may be mixed with the graft solvent, monomer, and the polymer at a temperature below the decomposition temperature of the initiator. For instance, mixing may be carried out at below 40 Reaction is typically carried out at 60 to 180 Typical graft polymers contain one unit derived from graft monomer per 12.5 to 10,000, e.g. 167, carbon atoms of the charge backbone polymer. Alternatively expressed, there may be 0.1 to 80, e.g. 6 graft units per 1000 carbon atoms of polymer backbone. For ease of handling, the polymerization solvent may be exchanged with a heavier solvent, such as SUS 100 oil. Product graft polymer is typically obtained as a solution of 6 to 12 parts by weight, e.g. 8.5 parts by weight thereof in 88 to 94 parts by weight, e.g. 91.5 parts by weight of solvent.

The viscosity index is determined by ASTM Test D 445. Dispersancy is determined by the Bench VC Test BVCT . In this test, the turbidity of an oil containing an additive is measured after heating the test oil to which has been added a standard blow by. The result, which correlates with dispersancy, is compared to three reference standards Excellent, Good and Fair , tested simultaneously with the test sample. The numerical rating decreases with an increase in dispersant effectiveness. Results similar to or lower than that of the Good reference indicate that the additive is a good candidate. It is possible to obtain product polymers which serve as multi functional additives which permit attainment of a dispersant, anti oxidant, viscosity index improver when added to a hydrocarbon lubricating oil or to a synthetic type lubricating oil.
