# Process for preparing vinyl chloride monomer.

## Abstract
The energy requirements for preparing vinyl chloride monomer can be reduced by a process which includes the steps of purifying by distillation ethylene dichloride, com pressing the ethylene dichloride vapor from the distillation column to a temperature and pressure sufficient for direct feed to a pyrolysis furnace. Up to 80 of the heat presently used after distillation and before pyrolysis can be saved.
