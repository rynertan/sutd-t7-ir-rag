# Motorcycle.

## Abstract
A motorcycle including a head pipe 2 with rectangular main pipe 3 and down pipe 4 elements rigidly attached to an engine 6 to define triangular truss structures to create a rigid frame. Brackets 5,7 cooperate with the ends of the main pipes to secure the same relative to the engine. The brackets may be employed as part of a sub assembly including the rear suspension. A rear swing arm 11 and the cushion member 15 are both attached to the bracket structure and may be removed from the frame together. Other components may be advantageously coupled with the bracket structure to avoid excessive use of the frame itself for such mounting functions. Such items as footpegs 104 , a gear shift pedal 103 and a rectractable stand 101 may be fixed to side brackets 7 for easy pre assembly and reduced complexity.
