# Axial magnetic field gradient coil suitable for use with NMR apparatus.

## Abstract
A cylindrical coil for providing a magnetic field having a substantially linear gradient in an axial direction within the volume of the cylinder includes a cylindrical coil support structure and electrically conductive winding turns wound on the outer surface of the support structure. The winding turns are electrically insulated from each other and are located such that the axial density of the winding turns increases linearly from the center of the coil to each axial end thereof. Preferably, the winding turns are located so that the angular position of the spiral path of the windings on the surface of the cylindrical support structure satisfies the relationship determined by the equation The coil may also include additional electrically conduc tive winding turns for compensating for variations in the linearity of the magnetic field gradient which are due to the coil being of finite length. Coils in accordance with the instant invention may be utilized to provide an improved nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and analysis system.
