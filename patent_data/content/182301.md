Many patent applications have so far been for cephem or carbacephem compounds, among which ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, ceftriaxone, etc. are known as those having a heterocyclic thio group at the 3 position. As a cephem compound having a heterocyclic thio group at the 3 position, a compound represented by the formula wherein R wherein R wherein R Antibiotics having wide antibacterial spectrum and strong antibacterial activity are always in demand. US A 4,150,156 relates to 3 substituted thio 7 substituted methyl cephalosporin compounds of the general formula wherein the methyl substituents are i.a. substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or heteroaryl residues, R³ is a hydrogen or halogen atom or an alkoxy, alkylthio group, R⁵ is i.a. a heteroaryl or heteroaralkyl group, A is CH₂ or S and R⁶ is PO OH ₂, SO₂ OH , SO₂NH₂. The present invention relates to carbacephem and cephem compounds represented by the formula I wherein X is S or CH₂, n is an integer of 1 to 5, R₁ is an unsubstituted or substituted heterocyclic group, wherein the heterocyclic group is a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic group having 1 to 4 of O , S and N atoms, wherein the substituents on the heterocyclic group include straight or branched lower alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms methyl, ethyl, etc. , hydroxyl, amino, nitro, or CH₂ wherein R₄ is an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl or 2 aminothiazolyl group wherein the substituents of the phenyl group include straight or branched lower alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a hydroxyl, amino, nitro, carboxyl group, etc., or a group represented by the formula wherein R₆ is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and R₇ is a lower alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or phenyl, or by the formula and when the substituent of the heterocyclic group is a lower alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or CH₂ The compounds I have a strong antibacterial activity on not only the gram negative bacteria, but also gram positive bacteria. In the definition of R₁, the preferred heterocyclic groups are 5 or 6 membered monoheterocyclic groups having only 1 to 4 N atoms and the largest possible number of non cumulative double bonds, 5 and 6 membered monoheterocyclic groups having only one S or O atom and the largest possible number of non cumulative double bonds, or 5 or 6 membered monoheterocyclic groups having one S or O atom and one or two N atoms and the largest possible number of non cumulative double bonds. More specifically, the preferable heterocyclic groups include, for example, pyridyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, oxazolyl, triazolyl, pyrimidyl, imidazolyl, triazinyl, etc. In the definition of R₃, the alkali metal atom includes sodium, potassium, etc., the alkaline earth metal atom includes calcium, magnesium etc. A process for preparing the compounds I is described below wherein R ₂ represents R₂ or R₂ whose amino group is protected by an amino protective group R ₃ represents a carboxyl protective group A represents chlorine or a group represented by the formula OSO₂R₈, wherein R₈ is a lower alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms for example, methyl or an unsubstituted or substituted aryl group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms for example, phenyl, naphthyl, tolyl, etc. , X has the same meaning as defined above to reaction with a thiol compound represented by the formula HS CH₂ Any amino protective group can be used in R ₂ of the general formula II , so long as it is an easily releasable amino protective group as used in the peptide chemistry, and particularly it is exemplified by trityl, formyl, chloroacetyl, bromoacetyl, 2,2,2 trichloroacetyl, t butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, etc. Any carboxyl protective group can be used as R ₃, inasfar it is an easily releasable protective group as used in the peptide chemistry. Particular examples of this group are t butyl, benzyl, p nitrobenzyl, benzhydryl, trityl, trimethylsilyl, etc. The inert solvent to be used in the reaction of the compound II with the thiol compound includes dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, methylene chloride, acetonitrile, etc. As a base, a metal hydride such as sodium hydride, lithium hydride, etc., an organic amine such as triethylamine, N,N diisopropylethylamine, N methylmorpholine, etc., can be used. The reaction is carried out at 0 to 90 C, and it is preferable to use 1 to 4 equivalent weights of the thiol compound on the basis of the compound II and also it is preferable to use an equivalent weight of the base on the basis of the thiol compound. The thus obtained product is subjected to the successive removal of protective group before or after purification by silica gel column chromatography, etc. A compound I where R₁ is a quaternary ammonium group can also be prepared according to another procedure, i.e. by subjecting a compound II to reaction with a thiol compound represented by R ₁ CH₂ The removal of the protective group can be carried out according to the procedure frequently used in the cephalosporin chemistry without deteriorating the functional groups of the compound. For example, conversion to carboxyl group can be attained with trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid, etc. when R ₃ is a t butyl or benzhydryl group, or by catalytic reduction when R ₃ is a p nitrobenzyl or benzhydryl group. When the protective group in R ₂ is t butoxycarbonyl, it can be removed with trifluoroacetic acid or formic acid, and in the case of a trityl group, it can be removed by acetic acid or hydrochloric acid. In the case of a benzyloxycarbonyl group, it can be removed by catalytic reduction. However, the simultaneous release of the carboxyl protective group and the amino protective group is desirable. The thus obtained compound I 1 is, if necessary, subjected to reaction with various inorganic and organic bases or to an esterification reaction, according to the conventional procedure, whereby the compound I with R₃ other than hydrogen can be prepared. The compound I has a strong antibacterial effect on the gram positive bacteria and the gram negative bacteria, whereas its toxicity is very low. For example, LD₅₀ values of the compounds obtained in the following Examples 2, 9 and 11 by intravenous administration to mouse are 1.8 g kg, 1.8 g kg and more than 2.5 g kg, respectively. Thus, the compound I is useful for treatment of various infections, as a sterilizer and as an antiseptic component.
