# Method and apparatus for handling hollow cylindrical articles such as metal containers.

## Abstract
Apparatus for handling hollow cylindrical containers 22 ejected axially in succession from a turret 13 rotating continuously or intermittently, comprises a receiving device 20 having a part cylindrical surface adapted to engage as a close fit against the cylindrical wall of each container, the part cylindrical surface being formed with a recess 23 , and suction means 24 for evacuating air from the recess so as to create a vacuum in the recess when covered by the cylindrical wall of a container. The receiving device is arranged so that a container ejected from the turret moves along the part cylindrical surface and progressively covers the recess so that suction is generated rapidly in the recess when it is finally closed off by the container. The suction in the recess draws the container into frictional sliding contact with the part cylindrical surface so as to arrest the container and hold it against the surface. The container is released onto a conveyor 39 by connecting the recess to atmos phere. The receiving device may comprise a turret arranged to carry containers to a discharge station above a conveyor.

## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HANDLING HOLLOW CYLINDRICAL ARTICLESSUCH AS METAL CONTAINERS This invention relates to a method and apparatus for transferring hollow articles having cylindrical side walls, such as for example hollow cylindrical metal containers open at one end, between two stations, and is concerned more particularly with a method and apparatus for catching and orientating hollow articles which have been ejected axially by air pressure from holding devices such as mandrels or chambers. Machines for manufacturing or treating metal containers in mass production commonly comprise a turntable or turret fitted with holding devices for the containers, the turntable being rotatable at high speed intermittently or continuously past loading and unloading stations. It is common practice in machines of this type for the containers to be elected axially from the holding devices by a timed blast of air so as to engage the containers against a plate rotated or indexed in unison with the turntable of the machine. The containers are held to the plate by the use of magnetic or suction devices so that they can be carried clear of the machine for discharge onto a conveyor or runway.With such machines the noise on impact of the containers with the magnetic or suction devices is considerable, and it is difficult to dampen this noise even with cushioning material because the containers are drum like structures which tend to generate sound when even the slightest impact occurs on the base. Factory noise is a matter of growing concern in the container making industry, and the object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for transferring hollow articles having cylindrical side walls between two stations by pneumatic pressure without undue shock or impact on the articles. According to the present invention there is provided a method of transferring a hollow article having a cylindrical side wall from an unloading station to a receiving station, the article being arranged in the unloading station with the axis of the article aligned approximately in the general direction of a receiving device at said receiving station, the receiving device having a part cylindrical surface adapted to engage as a close fit around part of the cylindrical side wall of the article, the method comprising ejecting the article by pneumatic pressure from the unloading station in the axial direction of the article towards the receiving device, and drawing the article by suction upon arrival at the receiving station to bring the cylindrical side wall of the article into frictional sliding contact with said part cylindrical surface so as to hold the article against said surface. According to the invention there is also provided apparatus for transferring a hollow article having a cylindrical side wall from an unloading station to a receiving station, comprising a holding device adapted to locate the article in a predetermined position in the unloading station with the axis of the article aligned approximately in the general direction of the receiving station, means for ejecting the article by pneumatic pressure from said predetermined position in the unloading station in the axial direction of the article towards the receiving station, and a receiving device adapted to arrest the axial movement of the article upon arrival at the receiving station, the receiving device having a part cylindrical surface extending approximately parallel to the axial direction of the article in said predetermined position and adapted to engage around part of the cylindrical side wall of the article as a close fit, and suction means operable to draw the article by suction upon arrival at the receiving station to bring the cylindrical wall of the article into frictional sliding contact with the part cylindrical surface of the receiving device and hold the article against said surface. The present invention enables the noise factor in container making machines to be substantially reduced, by bringing each container to rest gradually, when ejected, using the friction between the side wall and the shaped receiving device against which it is held by the suction means, thus avoiding impact with the base. The position at which the container finally comes to rest is dependent on air and vacuum pressures and machine speed, so that the final positions of succeeding containers tends to vary. This inconsistency may cause problems when the containers are released onto the output conveyor at very high speeds of operation, and means may be provided for limiting this variation and for bringing the containers back to a constant position with the open end very close to a conveyor surface. For example, the machine may be provided with an abutment for stopping the axial movement of the containers after their speed has been substantially reduced by frictional sliding contact with the part cylindrical surface of the receiving device. In a case in which the receiving device is a turret, cam guides may be provided to adjust the position of the containers upon rotation of the turret.In this way, precise control of the movements of the containers can be achieved over a range of machine speeds and without precise air pressure controls. It has been found in practice that apparatus according to the invention need require only about half the air pressure used for some conventional container making machines carrying out the same operations, thereby resulting in lower energy requirements and less noise from the air blast itself. The present invention is an ideal counterpart to the high speed container feeding system described in British PatentSpecification Neo.1591158 and apart from other applications is very suitable for use with machines as described in British PatentSpecification Nos. 1498795and15718O7, all relating to continuously rotating high speed container cleaning and treating machines. Thus according to the present invention there is also provided apparatus for transferring to a conveyor a plurality of hollow articles of the same size having cylindrical side walls and mounted on individual holding devices on a main turret which is rotatable to pass each holding device in succession through an unloading station, the articles being arranged in the holding devices with their axes substantially parallel to the rotational axis of the main turret, said apparatus comprising a receiving turret rotatably mounted about an axis substantially parallel to the rotational axis of the main turret, the receiving turret having at least one part cylindrical surface adapted to engage around part of the cylindrical wall of each article as a close fit, the centre line of the radius of curvature of the or each part cylindrical surface being substantially parallel to the rotational axis of the receiving turret, and the receiving turret being rotatable to pass the or each part cylindrical surface through 2 receiving station in which the part cylindrical surface is arranged to receive an article ejected from a holding device at the unloading station, the or each part cylindrical surface also passing through a discharge station above said conveyor upon rotation of the receiving turret, means for continuously rotating said turrets in synchronism such that when a holding device on the main turret is at the unloading station the or a part cylindrical surface on the receiving turret is at the receiving station, means operable to eject by pneumatic pressure an article in a holding device at the unloading station in the axial direction of the article and towards the part cylindrical surface at the receiving station, and suction means operable to draw the article by suction upon arrival at the receiving station to bring the cylindrical wall of the article into frictional sliding contact with the part cylindrical surface so as to hold the article against said surface, and means operable to release the suction upon further angular movement of the receiving turret to a position in which the partcylindrical surface carrying the article is in said discharge station so that the article falls onto the conveyor. One form of the invention is also applicable to machines in which the turret rotates intermittently from station to station. A machine of this type for printing and drying metal containers is described in British Patent Specification No. 1489746. The invention will now be described with reference to the drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of apparatus according to the invention applied to a machine for handling hollow cylindrical containers and having an intermittently rotating turret such as that described inBritish Patent Specification No. 1489746 or in the corresponding specifications of Swedish Patent Application 7416182 9, German PatentApplication P24 59 588.8, Dutch Patent Application 74.16686, BelgiumPatent 823667, French Patent Application 7442358, or Italian PatentApplication 30833 A 74 . Figure 2 is a section through the unloading station on the line X X in Figure 1 with a container on a mandrel about to be ejected by compressed air. Figure 3 is a section on the same line showing a container which has been released into a discharge chute and the following container as it is brought to rest by the receiving device. Figure 4 is a view in direction of arrow B in Figure 2. Figure 5 is an elevation in direction of arrow B in Figure 6 showing the invention applied to a machine for handling hollow cylindrical containers and having a continuously rotating turret of the type described in British Patent Specification No. 1498795 or in the corresponding specifications of Swedish Patent Application 7503225 0,German Patent Application P25 11 548.4, Dutch Patent Application 75.03423, Belgium Patent 826964, French Patent 7508785, or ItalianPatent 1034466 . Figure 6 is a section on the line Z Z in Figure 5 and 7. Figure 7 is a section on the line Y Y in Figure 6 showing a drive mechanism synchronising the rotation of a main turret with rotation of a receiving turret, and a mechanism for ensuring accurately positioned containers at the instant of transfer to a discharge conveyor, and Figure 8 is a side elevation of the receiving turret showing guide means for correcting the position of the containers. Referring to Figures 1 4 of the drawings, an intermittently rotating turret 1 carries a number of mandrels 2 which hold hollow cylindrical containers 3 retained in position by vacuum applied through a conduit 4 in each mandrel during the processing sequences of the machine, the turret being rotatable into index positions in which each mandrel in succession is in register with an unloading station, with the container on the mandrel in a predetermined position at the unloading station. A container receiving device 5 is positioned at a receiving station adjacent the unloading station.The receiving device has a part cylindrical surface 6 shaped to be a close fit around part of the cylindrical wall of each container 3, and the receiving device is positioned with the axis of curvature of the surface 6 approximately in line with the central axis of each mandrel when it is in register with the unloading station. A recess 7 is formed in the part cylindrical surface 6, and a port 8 opens into the recess for evacuation of air therefrom by a suction system not shown . A valve system actuated by the indexing mechanism of the machine not shown connects the port 8 and recess 7 to the suction system when the turret is in the stationary indexed position and to atmosphere when the turret is rotating. At each index position of the turret, the container 3 on the mandrel 2 which is in register with the unloading station is forcibly ejected from the mandrel by compressed air supplied to the conduit 4.The container is ejected in the axial direction of the mandrel, which as explained previously is in line with the axis of curvature of the part cylindrical surface 6 on the receiving device, so that the container moves across the receiving device in close proximity to the surface 6. At the index position of the turret, the suction means is evacuating air from the recess 7 and thereby inducing a flow of air into the recess to replace the evacuated air. When the container reaches the position A shown in Figure 3, the corner 9 of the container closes off the recess, thereby stopping the flow of air into the recess and immediately generating a vacuum in the recess.Suction is thus applied suddenly to the part of the cylindrical wall of the container covering the whole area of the recess 7 so as to draw the container into frictional sliding contact with the curved surface 6 of the container receiving device and thereby bring it to rest with very little sound. Wlen the turret rotates again to bring the next mandrel to the unloading station, the valve system disconnects the recess 7 from the suction system and opens the recess to atmosphere so that the container falls into a discharge chute 11. The exact position of each arrested container depends on the eject air pressure and the intensity of the suction system.To allow for some variation the open end 12 of the discharge chute is played out and an abutment 10 is provided to limit the travel of the container in extreme cases. Figures 5 8 show the application of the invention to a machine having a continuously rotating turret of the type described in ourBritish Specification No. 1498795. This machine comprises a main turret 13 carrying a number of holding devices 14 spaced at equal intervals around the turret and each having an open topped annular cavity adapted to hold a hollow cylindrical container 22 with the axis of the container approximately parallel to the rotational axis of the turret 13, the turret being rotatable to pass the holding devices 14 in succession through an unloading station, and a receiving turret 20 rotatable about an axis parallel to the rotational axis of the main turret 13.The receiving turret 20 has six part cylindrical surfaces 21 spaced at equal intervals around the turret and shaped to be a close fit around part of the cylindrical wall of a container22 the axes of curvature of the surfaces 21 being parallel to and spaced at equal distances from the rotational axis of the receiving turret. The receiving turret is rotatable to pass each part cylindrical surface 21 in succession through a receiving station in which the surface 21 is arranged to receive a container ejected from a holding device 14 at the unloading station. Each part cylindrical surface 21 has a recess 23, a suction port 24 and an abutment plate 25 similar to the recess 7, port 8 and abutment 10 of the arrangement of Figures 1 4. The receiving turret 20 is attached by screws 16 to a sleeve 26 which in turn is secured to a gear 27 by screws 28, and the assembly of the turret, sleeve and gear is rotatably mounted on a tubular stationary shaft 51 by a ball bearing 18 at the upper end and by a journal bearing 30 at the lower end of the shaft 51. The shaft 51 is secured to the frame 17 of the machine by screws 29. The pitch circle diameter of gear 27 is substantially the same as the pitch circle diameter on which lie the axes of curvature of the surfaces 21. The gear 27 is in mesh with a large ring gear 31 secured to the underside of the main turret 13 by screws 32, and the holding devices 14 are secured to the main turret 13 in spaced relationship with their centres lying on substantially the same pitch circle diameter as the ring gear 31. In this way the turrets 13, 20 are caused to rotate in unison, with each part cylindrical surface 21 on the receiving turret passing through the receiving station at the same time and at the same velocity as a holding device 14 on the main turret is passing through the unloading station. The receiving turret is provided with suction valve means comprising a collar 33 clamped to the stationary shaft 51 by a locking ring 34, and a cylindrical valve hub 35 secured to the collar 33 by screws 36, the hub being engaged as a close running fit within an internal cylindrical bore in the receiving turret. The hub has a central chamber 38 which is connected through the central passageway in the tubular shaft 51 with suction means not shown , and the side wall of the hub is formed with a slot 37 Figure 6 which allows suction from the chamber 38 to be applied to the ports 24 whilst the turret is rotating, the slot 37 covering an angle of approximately 1500, and with a further slot 44 arranged to connect each recess 23 to atmosphere when the associated part cylindrical surface 21 is at a discharge station. A take off belt conveyor 39 having a series of holes 43 in the belt and guide rails 40 extends through the discharge station.The belt passes over a suction box 41 connected to a suction fan system not shown and a longitudinal slot 42 in the box 41 is arranged to apply suction to the holes 43 in the belt so that containers dropped onto the belt are held by suction and thereby steadied as they are conveyed away from the machine. In operation the main turret 13 is rotated in a counter clockwise direction as viewed in Figure 6 to bring the holding devices, loaded with containers, successively to the unloading station. As explained previously, a part cylindrical surface 21 on the receiving turret is in register with the receiving station whenever a holding device is at the unloading station, and the recess 23 in the partcylindrical surface is connected to the suction neans through its port 24, the slot 37, chamber 38 and the central passageway in the shaft 51. Just before each holding device reaches the unloading station, valve mechanism not shown applies compressed air to a conduit 19 in the holding device to eject its container rapidly from the cavity in the holding device.The container then slides up the part cylindrical surface 21 at the receiving station, and is brought to rest at the position B Figure 5 by the friction imposed on the cylindrical wall of the container as the air flow is shut off and the suction force is developed in the recess 23. When the container carried by the receiving turret reaches the discharge station shown at E in Figure 6, the port 24 associated with the part cylindrical surface carrying the container comes into alignment with the slot 44, thereby releasing the suction in the recess 23 and causing the container to drop onto the belt conveyor.The rails 40 guide the container onto the belt. It will be appreciated that some variation in positioning of the containers on the receiving turret will arise, as shown by the containers at positions B, C D and E in Figure 5, but this is permissible for normal operating conditions, and the extreme high position of a container is of course limited by the abutment plate 52 It will also be appreciated that when the machine is running at high speed centrifugal force will tend to throw the containers into sliding contact with the part cylindrical surfaces at the receiving station at position B, thus adding to the reliability of the transfer.Also, at position E centrifugal force will tend to throw containers out of contact with the receiving turret and against the guide rails 40, thereby again increasing the reliability of the system. For high speed operation, the receiving turret is preferably provided with a heavy swash plate 47, as shown in Figure 7, for guiding the containers to a position directly above the belt conveyor upon rotation of the turret. The plate 47 is freely rotatable on an inclined shaft 48 which is secured in the top of the valve hub 35, the plate being in running contact with an annular flange 49 on the turret 20. The plate is thus driven at substantially the same peripheral speed as the receiving turret. The underside of the plate 47 is formed with an annular flange 50 arranged to position the containers progressively as the turret rotates so as to bring the lower edge of each container into close proximity to the belt conveyor upon arrival at position E. This guide system is particularly suitable for use with a machine adapted to provide a surface coating to containers, since there is no rubbing action of the swash plate on the base of the container. Figure 8 shows an alternative positioning system which comprises stationary guides 45 and 46 arranged to engage the ends of the containers upon rotation of the receiving turret and guide the containers into a position just above the belt conveyor upon arrival at the discharge station.
