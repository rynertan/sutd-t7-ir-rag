# HYDRAULIC MASTER SLAVE CYLINDER CLUTCH WITH SAFETY SYSTEM TO ASSURE POSITIVE CLUTCH ACTUATION

## Abstract
A hydraulic master slave system for clutch actuation includes a safety system to prevent a vehicle from being started unless the clutch is positively actuated. The preferred safety system comprises a pair of Hall effect sensors located respectively in the master cylinder and the slave cylinder to detect whether the cylinders are operating properly. Both sensors would have to be actuated to start the vehicle. Other detecting systems useful in the present invention include fluid pressure sensors, optical bar code readers or micro switches.
