# Sleeving method.

## Abstract
A sleeving method wherein a metal sleeve 16 is inserted into a tube 10 so as to bridge a defective re gion of the tube 10 . The sleeve 16 has teeth 40 on the outside thereof which tightly contact the inside sur face of the defective tube 10 and create a labyrinth type seal. The sleeve 16 is then internally pressurized in the area where the teeth 40 are located. This expansion of the sleeve 16 causes the teeth 40 to engage the tube 10 . The other end of the sleeve 16 can then be either similarly attached to the tube 10 or welded to the tube 10 . Next, the remainder of the sleeve 16 is expanded which causes the sleeve 16 to shrink in length which results in the teeth slightly penetrating the inside surface of the tube thereby creating a leak tight seal therebetween.
