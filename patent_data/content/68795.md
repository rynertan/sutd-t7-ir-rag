# Process for producing vinyl acetate.

## Abstract
A process for producing vinyl acetate which comprises decomposing ethylidene diacetate in the presence of at least one compound selected from fluorides, bromides, chlorides, iodides, halogens and mixtures thereof is disclosed. Accord ing to this invention decomposition rate of ethylidene diacetate is high and selectivity to vinyl acetate is also high.
