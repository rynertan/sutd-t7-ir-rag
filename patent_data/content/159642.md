# Thermal head.

## Abstract
A thermal head for use in a dot matrix printer is dis closed in which a plurality of heating elements 51, 54 for printing dots on recording paper 8 are arranged in a line oblique with respect to the moving direction of the thermal head, the dimension W of the heating surface of each heat ing element in a direction A parallel to the moving direc tion of the thermal head is made smaller than the dimension H of the heating surface in a direction B perpendicular to the above moving direction, each of wiring conductor pairs 52, 53 55, 56 for supplying a current to the heating ele ments is extended from both ends of the heating surface in the lengthwise direction thereof, in a direction B perpen dicular to the moving direction of the thermal head, one wir ing conductor of each wiring conductor pair is connected to a common wiring conductor 62 , and the other wiring con ductor of each wiring conductor pair is connected directly to the drive circuit.
