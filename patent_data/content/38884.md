# Method of making flexible wallcoverings and wallcoverings so made.

## Abstract
A flexible wallcovering is made by applying a foamable composition to a woodchip paper by a screen printing process and then foaming the composition. The woodchips 14 expose a clearly observable relief on the surface which is to carry the foamable composition. The woodchip paper comprise a single paper ply 12 or prefer ably, the wallcovering is of two ply construction with a wood chip content between the plies and the paper is formulated so that the upper ply is dry removable from the lower ply. The woodchips 14 are at least 2 mm in average length and the woodchips 14 form 20 to 35 by weight of the paper.
