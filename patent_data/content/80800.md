# A method of manufacturing a radial flow ceramic turbine rotor.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a radial flow turbine rotor is disclosed, which comprises the steps of injection molding a rotor body including a conical shaft 1 and a plurality of blades 2 formed on the periphery of the shaft 1 and at an angle to the axis of the shaft 1 from a ceramic material using a mold having parting lines corresponding to the blade edges such that projections 5 are formed on the blade edges, sintering the molding thus obtained, and grinding the edge surfaces 6 of the blades facing a casing. The blades 2 are thus provided with projections 5 on their inlet and outlet edges 3 and 4 which face a fluid passage.
