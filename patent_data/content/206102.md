# PROGRAMMABLE INTERFACE

## Abstract
A programmable interface to selectively couple the termi nals of an electronic system to desired circuit locations within the system. By applying programming signals to the input terminals of the interface in a prescribed sequence, the inter face is programmed so that subsequently applied control sig nals will be coupled to the desired circuit locations. The func ton served by each terminal thus depends on the programm ing sequence. Reprogramming can change the function of each of the terminals by coupling them to different circuit loca tions.
