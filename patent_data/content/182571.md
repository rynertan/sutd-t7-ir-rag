# Semiconductor switching device.

## Abstract
A compound transistor pair 11, 12 is provided with an auxiliary transistor 30 and a zener diode 31 so that while the compound transistor pair is conductive the voltage threshold switching means 31 blocks current supply from the base B of the bipolar transistor 11 to the control terminal of the auxiliary switch 30 and when the compound transistor pair is switched off the resultant rise in voltage across the voltage threshold switching means 31 causes the latter to supply current from the base B of the bipolar transistor 11 to the control terminal of the auxiliary switch 30 so that the latter becomes conductive between the base B of the bipolar transistor 11 and said source S of the field effect transistor 12. Preferably a voltage divider 32, 33 is also provided to control the maximum current IC through the switch.
