# Yarn brake for a textile machine.

## Abstract
A yarn brake 18 for a textile machine comprises a stationary clamping plate 25 and a movable clamping plate 24 . The plates 24 and 25 are forced together by first biasing means 52, 62 and second basing means 45, 50 to provide full braking pressure on a yarn passing between the plates 24, 25 . De activating means 72, 73 and 75 operate to selectively nullify the effect of the second biasing means 45, 50 to provi de partial braking pressure on the yarn, or to nullify the effects of both biasing means 52, 62 and 45, 50 so that there is no braking pressure on the yarn. The invention also includes a weft yarn braking system for a multi weft loom utilizing a yarn brake 18 of the present invention for each weft yarn. Control means 88 , operating in timed relation to the loom, operate the brakes in a programmed sequence. The yarns are fully bra ked when not being inserted into the loom. When a weft yarn is inserted into the loom, its brake 18 is fully de activated so that there is no braking pressure on the yarn during the major portions of its insertion into the loom and the brake 18 is par tially de activated during the latter portion of said insertion to provide partial braking of the yarn.
