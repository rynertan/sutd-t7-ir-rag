# Fire guard.

## Abstract
A fire guard is provided which consists substantially of a row of spaced apart vertical pipes 7 which, when erected in front of a radiation source, such as an open fire 1 , are heated by the radiation emitted by the source, in their turn heat the air inside them and thereby convert the radiation heat into convection heat, so that the pipes 7 then operate as chimneys, whereby cool air is drawn out of and heated air is ejected into the room to be heated. The characterizing feature of this fire guard is the fact that all adjacent pipes 7 are detachably hinged 11,12 to one another.
