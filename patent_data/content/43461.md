## Description
Electrode for cardiac stimulators and process for its manufacture This invention refers to an electrode for cardiac stimulators pacemaker comprising a metallic tip with a porous surface of contact with the cardiac wall.As compared with a smooth surface tip, a porous surface tip presents several advantages, such as a good fastening to the cardiac wall owing to a better growth of the cardiac tissue on the porous substrate low polarization losses owing to increased contact surface at a parity of impulse from the pacemaker, a greater current directly transmitted to the cells of the cardiac muscle and therefore a wider safety margin a lower voltage threshold, which permits the use of impulses at a lower energy level without decreasing the safety margin increased sensitivity of the electrode to the endocardic signals thanks to a lower attenuation of the latter at their passage from the cells to the tip.The known tips with porous contact layer are constituted by stainless steel. An object of the present invention is to provide an electrode with improved contact tip, able to further enhance the above recalled advantages. A further object of the invention is to provide a process for obtaining such improved contact tip.In the electrode according to the invention the contact tip comprises a body of platinum iridium alloy coated with platinum sponge. The diameter of the pores of the platinum sponge is advantageously of the order of 40 microns. The thickness of the coating is preferably of the order of 0.1 mm greater thickness values don t improve the result.Still preferably, the weight ratio platinum iridium in the alloy which forms the body of the tip is at least substantially 90 10.The process according to the invention is basically characterized in that the coating of platinum sponge on the body of platinum iridium is formed by porous layer electrolytic deposition as distinct from compact layer deposition , whereupon, preferably, the obtained electrolytic layer is consolidated by sintering.The electrolyte preferably consists of chloroplatinic acid H2PtCl6 .H20 dissolved in deionized water in a proportion of about 3g per 100 cc watcr. The applied voltage on the electrolyzer can vary from 2 to 10 V.In order to obtain a platinum deposit of desired poro sity, the current density should be maintained in the range of 1 2 Amp sq.cm, preferably 1.5 Amp sq.cm. The necessary thickness of the coating is obtained in a time from 1 to 5 minutes. After rinsing it is possible to proceed with sintering, preferably at about 13000C for about 20 minutes. In the sintering furnace, or during the subsequent cooling of the tip, no particular protective atmosphere is necessary.An electrode according to the invention is illustrated in axial cross sectional view in the enclosed drawing.Reference 1 denotes a sheath of silicone rubber of an endocardiac probe, containing an electric conductor 2 in form of a helical spiral, which can be monofllament but preferably is composed of three filaments for reliability reasons, according to the known art.Reference 3 denotes the body of the tip of the electrode, from which a tubular shank 4 extends towards the sheath 1. The body 3 and the shank 4 are of platinum iridium 90 10. The spiral 2 extends beyond the sheath 1 and penetrates into the shank 4, which is crimped on a length of the spiral containing a small metallic cylinder 5 acting as anvil or mandrel against the crushing of the spiral during crimping. The shank 4 and the adjacent end portion of the sheath 1 are covered by a silicone rubber sleeve 6. ,,The body 3, forming a sort of mushroom on the shank 4, is coated with a porous platinum layer, denoted by 7, having pores of a diameter of about 40 microns. For obtaining such layer, the body 3 was dipped into an electrolute as hereinbefore described. The electrolysis was carried out in 5 minutes, with a voltage of 2.5Volt and a current density of 1.5 Amp sq. cm. The obtained coating was then sintered at l3000C for 20 minutes.
