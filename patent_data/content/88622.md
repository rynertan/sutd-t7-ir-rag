# Animal interferons, processes involved in their production, compositions containing them, DNA sequences coding therefor and expression vehicles containing such sequences and cells transformed thereby.

## Abstract
The basis of this disclosure rests on the discovery, identifi cation and isolation of a class of animal interferon polypeptides and to their production via recombinant DNA technology in all of its aspects including microbial and cell culture exploitation. A number of bovine interferons are illustrated as representative of the class.
