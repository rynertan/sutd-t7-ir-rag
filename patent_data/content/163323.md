# Cosmetic container and applicator.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an improved cosmetic container and appli cator comprising a a container 15 having an open end 75 and a closed end 80 b an applicator 10 including a cap 5 , an elongated rod 35 , and a brush 65 c an upper wiper element 30 located at or near the open end 75 of the container 15 and d a lower wiper element 55 located further from the open end 75 of the container 15 than the first wiper element 30 , the lower wiper 55 serving to divide the container 15 into two chambers 50, 70 . The upper wiper 30 removes excess makeup 40 from the brush 65 when it is removed from the container 15 and, preferrably, also wipes the surface of the rod 35 clean when the rod is removed from the container 15 . The lower wiper 55 cleans the brush 65 after every use, thereby virtually eliminating the building up and drying of makeup 40 that would otherwise occur on the brush 65 .
