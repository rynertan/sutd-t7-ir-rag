## Description
The present invention relates to an eddy current diagnostic device which is suited for measuring thickness, for detecting flaws and for measuring the size of flaws in structures such as conduits. An eddy current method has been extensively used to non destructively inspect metallic materials, and the state of the art is new such that flaw can be precisely measured. The conventional method of precisely measuring flaws based upon the phase method has been announced in the journal Mitsubishi Jyuko Giho entitled Eddy Current Flaw Detecting Technique for Heat Conducting Pipes , Vol. 13, No. 3, May 1976, pp. 33 39. With this method, the phase of flaw detection signal changes depending upon the depth of the flaw, the ratio relative to the whole thickness, whereby the size of the flaw is measured. This method can be effectively adapted when the shape of flaw does not change, but is not effective for detecting flaws of a variety of shapes such as cracks in an object, since the phase does not change linearly in such cases. The object of the present invention is to provide equipment which is capable of precisely measuring the thickness and flaws of an object relying upon the eddy current method. The invention is set out in claim 1. The preamble of claim 1 is based on DE U 7638775. The logical background of the present invention will be described below, first, in conjunction with Figs. 1 to 4, prior to explaining the present invention. The present invention is based upon the phenomenon that the half value width of signals being detected by an eddy current scanning probe changes with the depth of penetration of eddy current, thereby enabling precise measurement of the thickness of the object and the dimensions of the flaw. Fig. 1 shows schematically measurement of a flaw based upon the half value width. In other words, Fig. 1 shows the relation between the scanning position x of the eddy current probe 1 and the amplitude V of the flaw detection signal. If explained using a coordinate x, z to simplify the description, the flaw 3 in the object 2 has a width w and is located at a position of a depth d from the surface of the object 2. Described below is a principle of the invention to measure the size of the flaw 3. That is, if a coil excited by an AC current is brought close to a conductor which is an object, an eddy current is generated in the conductor due to electromagnetic induction. The intensity of eddy current varies with the surface conditions, magnetic properties and electric properties of the object. According to the eddy current flaw detecting method, the change in the intensity of eddy current is detected as the change of impedance of a coil thereby to measure the flaw and properties of the object Hideyuki Ito et al., Electromagnetic Induction Testing, Handbook of Non destructive Inspection, Chapter 5, published by Nikkan Kogyo Shimbunsha, 1978 . Referring to Fig. 1, if the probe 1 is scanned, the amplitude V of flaw detection signal starts to change from the position x₁, i.e., increases and then decreases and returns to the initial balanced value. Here, the amplitude V varies because of the reasons described below. That is, equilibriums has been so accomplished that the amplitude V becomes O when the probe 1 is placed on an object 2 that contains no flaw, the probe 1 then scans. Here, however, equilibrium is lost as the probe 1 approaches the flaw 3, and the amplitude V which is equivalent to an unbalanced signal increases. Therefore, the unbalanced condition peaks when the probe 1 scans directly over the flaw 3, and the amplitude V peaks. As the probe 1 moves away from the position just over the flaw 3, the amplitude V decreases and equilibrium is restored where the amplitude V is O. Here, the scan distance Shi in which the amplitude V is greater than a predetermined value V₀, is affected by the depth δ The predetermined value V₀ may be experimentally found from a relation S N of the measuring system, or may be set to a value that is smaller than a maximum amplitude by a predetermined ratio, or may be set to a value that is larger than the initial balanced value by a predetermined ratio. Here, if the distribution C of eddy current or the depth δ of penetration is changed depending upon the frequency f for exciting the probe 1 or the intensity H of DC magnetic field applied to the object 2, another scan distance Shj is obtained for the same flaw. The scan distance, in this case, is given by the following equation 2 , Further, if the width w is eliminated from the equations 1 and 2 , the following equation is obtained 3 where, Therefore, if calibration curves are prepared in advance by experimentally or theoretically finding ralations between the difference ΔSh of scan distance and the depth d of flaw, the depth of flaw can be obtained from the difference ΔSh of scan distance when an unknown flaw is inspected. Fig. 2 shows a calibration curve which experimentally demonstrates the fact that the difference ΔSh of moving distance for the depth of flaw can be represented by a single curve even when the flaw has a different width w. It has been pointed out that the depth δ of penetration of eddy current can be changed depending upon the excitation frequency f or the DC magnetic field intensity H for the object. The reason is obvious from the widely known equation 4 , where, Permeability µ of the object apparently changes depending upon the DC magnetic field intensity H applied from the external side. For instance, the permeability µ decreases with the increase in the DC magnetic field intensity H. Therefore, the depth δ of penetration changes depending upon the excitation frequency f or the DC magnetic field intensity H. Fig. 3 shows relations between the DC magnetic field intensity H and the depth δ of penetration of eddy current, wherein the parameter is the aforementioned threshold value V₀ set for the amplitude of flaw detection signal. It will be understood that as the threshold value V₀ is set high, the magnetic field intensity H must be increased to increase the depth δ of penetration. The depth d of flaw is measured as described above. An explanation is given below on how to find the width w of flaw. It has been explained that the scan distance Sh of eddy current probe changes depending upon the depth d and width w of flaw when the depth δ of penetration of penetration of eddy current is maintained constant. From the equation 1 , it is obvious that the width w of flaw is found as given by the following equation 5 , The first term on the right side of the equation 5 can be measured. The second term can also be found by calculation from a calibration curve that is obtained relying upon known flaws. Thus, the width w of the flaw can be found. Fig. 4 shows simulated results of eddy current distribution as an example of the function W δ In the above description, the eddy current probe scans the direction of the axis in Fig. 1. However, even when the eddy current probe scans in the direction of y axis, the width of flaw can also be found in the direction of y axis. In the foregoing were described the theoretical background and principle of the invention. Next, equipment required for invention will be described. Fig. 5 shows the structure of an eddy current diagnostic equipment of the present invention for calculating the size depth, width, length of flaw from the difference of moving distance of the eddy current probe. A direct current is supplied from a direct current source 3 to the eddy current probe 1, and a high frequency current is supplied from a high frequency oscillator 4 to the eddy current probe 1, so that the object 2 is DC magnetized and an eddy current penetrates thereinto. An eddy current detecting circuit 5 detects the eddy current in the object 2 via the eddy current probe 1 that is mechanically coupled to a scanner 6, and sends the amplitude V of flaw detection signal, which is a detected result, to a flaw measuring circuit 7 of the next stage. The flaw measuring circuit 7 calculates the depth d and width w of flaw in the object 2 upon receipt of the amplitude V and a probe position signal x or y from the scanner 6 and based further upon the aforementioned function W and the threshold value V₀ that have been input in advance. The flaw measuring circuit 7 feeds a desired excitation frequency f and a desired DC magnetic field intensity H that are necessary for calculating the depth and width of flaw, back to the high frequency oscillator 4 and to the direct current source 3. Here, the eddy current probe 1 may be an ordinary one using a high frequency coil, or may be of the structure which is further equipped with a DC magnetization coil. Further, the eddy current probe 1, direct current source 3, high frequency oscillator 4, eddy current detecting circuit 5 and scanner 6 may be those that operate as described above, and the existing devices can be utilized. However, the direct current source 3 and the high frequency oscillator 4 must be provided with external terminals to introduce the desired DC magnetic field intensity H and the desired excitation frequency f , respectively. Fig. 6 shows a structure of the flaw measuring circuit wherein the amplitude V of flaw detection signal from the eddy current detecting circuit 5 and the position signal x or y of eddy current probe 1 from the scanner 6 are alternately stored as a pair in the moving distance measuring circuits 73, 74 with memory via an A D converter circuit 71. First, the amplitude V and position signal x are stored in the moving distance measuring circuit 73 with memory when the DC magnetic field intensity is Hi or the excitation frequency is f The algorithm will be described below briefly. The algorithm finds a scanning position at which the amplitude V is greater than the threshold value V₀ and a scanning position at which the amplitude V is smaller than the threshold value V₀. Namely, an amplitude V k at a k th scanning position and a probe position x k are read from the memory to find such a k that V k 1 V₀ V k , and a scanning position x However, when there exists such a k that V k V₀ and V k 1 V₀, the scanning position is found according to the following equation, As for the scanning position x However, when there exists such a k that V k V₀ and V k 1 V₀, the scanning position x By finding a difference between x where, The changing width Δf of excitation frequency is controlled until the difference ΔSh of moving distance becomes larger than the significant difference ε. Even when the DC magnetic field intensity is to be changed, the control operation is performed in the same manner as above in accordance with the equation 11 . Here, symbols have the same meanings as those of the equation 10 . Here, whether the excitation frequency f should be changed or the DC magnetic field intensity H should be changed, is easily determined. When the object 2 consists of a ferromagnetic material, both the excitation frequency f and the DC magnetic field intensity H may be changed, but giving priority to the latter. When the object 2 is not composed of a ferromagnetic material, only the excitation frequency f need be changed. As mentioned above, the present invention makes it possible to easily and very precisely measure the size depth, width, length of flaws that could not be correctly measured with the existing eddy current method. Furthermore, the equipment of the present invention is simply constructed, and can be adapted to diagnosing structures and materials in a variety of fields relying upon the eddy current method.
