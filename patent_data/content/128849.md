## Description
BACKGROUND OF. THE INVENTION This invention relates to the isolation and purification of beta type transforming growth factor TGF beta from human blood platelets and human placental tissue, respectively. Transforming growth factors are biologically active peptides which induce anchorage dependent, non neoplastic cells to lose contact inhibition and to undergo anchorage independent growth. This property is unique to transformation growth factors TGFs , and it can be quantitated by measuring the formation of colonies of cells in soft agar. Two classes of transforming growth factors have been identified on the basis of their relationship with epidermal growth factor. Type beta TGFs are defined by an ability to compete with 125I labeled EGF for binding to theEGF cell surface receptor. They are single chain, low molecular weight Mr 10,000 peptides which have been found in the conditioned medium of transformed cell lines. In contrast, type beta TGFs do not bind to the EGF receptor, but they require EGF or TGF ci for expression of their biological activity. See Roberts, et al., ColdSpring Harbor Conf. Cell Proliferation 9 319 332 1982 Anzano, et al., Anal. Biochem. 125 217 224 1982 andAnzano, et al., Cancer Res. 42 4776 4778 1982 . Although type beta TGFs are present in transformed cells, they have also been detected in a variety of non neoplastic tissues see Roberts, et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.78 5339 5343 1981 suggesting a physiological role for these factors in modulating normal cell growth. One likely role for such growth factors is to participate in tissue repair and regeneration TGF beta, in conjunction with EGF, is an effective promotor of wound healing in vivo. The recent identification of TGF activitiy in serum and platelets further suggests a possible role for TGF beta in tissue repair see Childs, et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.U.S.A. 79 5312 5316 1982 . The biological effect of TGF beta has been well documented, but little is known about its major site s of synthesis and storage. Moreover, the lack of purifiedTGF beta has precluded many studies of its structure and mechanism of action. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been discovered that platelets contain 40 100 fold more TGF beta than do the other non neoplastic tissues examined to date. Complete purification of this platelet factor now shows that TGF beta is a polypeptide of about 25,000 daltons which is probably composed of two 12,500 dalton subunits held together by disulfide bonds.Its molecular weight, subunit structure, and amino acid composition differ from those of platelet derived growth factor PDGF . In contrast to most growth factors, platelet derived TGF beta does not appear to exert its growth promoting property by directly stimulating total DNA synthesis. Acidic ethanol extracts of human platelets induced non neoplastic NRK fibroblasts to undergo anchorage independent growth. Less than 100 ng ml of the crude extract elicits 50 of the maximal biological response when assayed in the presence of epidermal growth factor 2.5 ng ml . In the absence of epidermal growth factor the potency of the extract decreased 1000 fold. These results show that platelets contain a type beta transforming growth factor TGF beta . The specific activity of the platelet extract is 100 fold greater than that of other non neoplastic tissues. The growth factor was purified to homogeneity by sequential gel filtration, first in the absence and then in the presence of urea. These results, as well as its amino acid composition and its lack of strong mitogenic activity, show that this protein is distinct from platelet derived growth factor.When completely purified, platelet derived TGF beta elicits 50 of its maximal biological response at concentrations less than 5 x 10 12 M. It has also been discovered that a polypeptide transforming growth factor TGF , which induces anchorage dependent rat kidney fibroblasts to grow in soft agar, can be isolated from human placenta and purified to homogeneity. This polypeptide is classified as a type betaTGF because it does not compete with epidermal growth factor EGF for membrane receptor sites but does require EGF for induction of anchorage independent growth of indicator cells. Purification of this peptide was achieved by acid ethanol extraction of the placenta, followed by gel filtration, cation exchange and high pressure liquid chromatography of the acid soluble proteins. Homogeneity of the TGF beta from the final column was shown by its constant specific activity and amino acid composition across the peak of soft agar colony forming activity and by its migration as a single band at 23,000 to 25,000 molecular weight after NaDodSO polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under reducing conditions, the protein migrated on a gel as a single band at 13,000 molecular weight. The purified placental TGF beta caused half maximal growth stimulation of indicator cells in soft agar at 64 72 pg ml 3 x leo 12 M in the presence of 2 ng ml 3.4 x 10 10 M of EGF. Although TGFs.were originally found in tumor cells and were postulated to be involved in transformation and neoplastic cell growth, their presence in adult cells and tissues, in platelets, and in embryos as reported inTwardzik, et al., Cancer Res. 42 590 593 1982 imply thatTGFs have a normal physiological function as well. The purification of placental and platelet derived TGF beta to homogeneity, in accordance with the present invention, facilitates investigation of this function, since it permits the develpment of both receptor binding and radioimmunioassays. Such assays not only allow a specific, quick procedure for quantitation of TGF beta but will also permit investigation of the mechanism of action and the control of expression of TGF betas under normal and neoplastic conditions.Moreover, structural analysis of purified TGF beta provides information for initiation of cloning experiments. This information will allow eventual production of large quantities of human TGF beta, which is expected to have useful therapeutic applications in enhancement of wound healing and tissue repair. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 1. TGF Beta Derived from Platelets Transforming growth factors have been detected in a variety of non neoplastic tissues, but major sites of storage have not been identified. However, a comparison of both specific activities in initial extracts and yields of purified TGF beta shows that platelets are a major storage site for the growth factor they contain 40 100 fold moreTGF beta than do the other non neoplastic tissues which have been examined. This finding, in conjunction with the known role of platelets in wound healing, supports the hypothesis that at least one physiological role of TGF beta is to facilitate tissue repair and regeneration. The total purification of platelet derived TGF beta was facilitated by both the high specific activity of the platelet extract and the aberrant elution of the polypeptide during gel filtration. Contaminants with molecular weights similar to the TGF 25,000 daltons were removed on a column of acrylamide in 1 M acetic acid. In this system TGF beta elutes with proteins of half its mass. An apparent discrepancy in one fraction high biological activity and no detectable protein at 25,000 daltons was due to the fact that detection of TGF beta by bioassay is at least 100 fold more sensitive than chemical detection of the protein by electrophoresis and silver staining. Addition of urea to the eluant prevented this retardation and resulted in the complete separation of TGF beta from the lower molecular weight peptides. The overall recovery of biological activity from the purification procedure is somewhat low about 5 , but control studies showed that other platelet factors modulate TGF beta action. The specific activity of TGF beta decreased at least 10 fold when it was assayed in medium containing 10 plasma derived rather than whole blood derived serum data not shown. Removal of these factors during the purification procedure may well explain the observed decreases in total TGF beta biological activity.The maximal biological activity of PDGF also requires the presence of other bio active peptides. Purified, platelet derived TGF beta was characterized chemically and biologically Tables 1 and 2 .Its molecular weight 25,000 daltons , subunit structure two 12,500 dalton polypeptides indistinguishable bySDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and amino acid composition differ from that of PDGF. Moreover, PDGF is a potent mitogen whereas platelet derived TGF beta is, at best, weakly mitogenic. Using similar biochemical criteria platelet derived TGF beta is also distinct from the platelet protein family comprised of CTAP III, beta thromboglobulin, and platelet factor 4. The role of platelets as a source of growth factors has received widespread attention since the identification of PDGF. A platelet derived peptide C TAP III 9300 daltons has been purified to homogeneity and shown to be mitogenic for connective tissue cells. Two platelet growth factors distinct from PDGF have been identified on the basis of their isoelectric points. Recently, it has been shown that TGF activity is present in platelets and that the activity is enhanced by EGF. These studies with partially purified preparations yielded two active components during gel filtration Mr 12 16,000 and 6,000 . The larger protein is likely the 25,000 dalton TGF beta described herein eluting with an aberrantly low molecular weight during gel filtration in the absence of denaturant.The smaller TGF was not detected but attention has been focused only on the most active TGF species in platelets. Transforming growth factors having specific activities less than 10 of that of the 25,000 dalton TGF beta would not be detected with the activity limits imposed herein. Studies implicating PDGF in atherosclerosis and control of cell division have emphasized its physiological release from platelets during their aggregation at a site of injury. However, the characterization of PDGF as a competence factor suggests that platelet mediated control of cell growth likely involves a complex synergism between several bio active peptides. Platelet derived TGF beta has strong growth promoting ability, but it is not a strong mitogen. This unusual combination of biological properties suggests that this protein may play a unique role in those physiological and pathological processes where platelet derived factors modulate cell proliferation. A Examples of Platelet Derived TGF BetaPurification and Analysis Platelet Extraction Platelet concentrates 20 30 units, 2 5 days old were obtained through the courtesy of the National Institutes of Health Blood Bank Bethesda,Maryland, U.S.A. and centrifuged 3200 x g, 30 min, C to remove remaining plasma proteins. The platelets were washed twice by suspension in 500 ml portions of Tris HCl citrate buffer, pH 7.5 and centrifugation as described above.Washed platelets 20 30 g wet weights were added to a solution of acidic ethanol prepared as described elsewhere and immediately extracted in a homogenizer 4 ml acidic ethanol per g platelets , After incubation overnight at 40 C, precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was adjusted to pH 3 by addition of NH40H. Proteins and TGF activity were precipitated from the solution overnight at 4 C by addition of ethanol 2 vol, OOC and ethyl ether 4 vol, OOC . The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and suspended in 1 M acetic acid 10 ml . TGF activity was solubilized during an overnight extraction at 40C. Centrifugation clarified the solution the supernatant was freeze dried or subjected directly to gel filtration.The amount of protein in the extract was determined by weight or by reaction with Coomassie Blue using bovine plasma albumin as reference. Purification of Platelet Derived TGF Beta The solubilized platelet extract 10 ml in 1 M acetic acid was gel filtered at a flow rate of 20 ml h on a column 4.4 x 115 cm of acrylamide gel equilibrated in 1 M acetic acid.Fractions containing 5 ml were collected. The elution position of TGF beta was determined by bioassay as described below, and the fractions containing the peak of activity were pooled and freeze dried. The amount of protein in the pool was determined as described above. The residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 M acetic acid containing 8 M ultra pure urea and gel filtered at a flow rate of 3 ml h on a column 1.6 x 85 cm of acrylamide which had been equilibrated in the sample solvent. Fractions containing 0.5 ml were collected. To preclude the formation of cyanate in the solvent, the ultra pure urea was dissolved at pH 2 in 1 M acetic acid. The resulting solution was adjusted to final conditions by addition of glacial acetic acid and water. Aliquots of selected column fractions were tested for TGF beta activity.Fractions containing the peak of TGF beta activity were pooled, dialyzed against 1 M acetic acid to remove urea, and quick frozen for storage at 200C. The amount of TGF beta in the final solution was determined by amino acid analysis see below . Bioassay of TGF Beta The bioassay of TGF beta determines the ability of the polypeptide to induce anchorage independent growth in non neoplasticNRK fibroblasts by measuring the formation of colonies of cells in soft agar. The assay was performed as described inRoberts, et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77 3494 3498 1980 except that 1 3500 cells were used per dish, 2 incubation proceeded for 7 days at 370C in a humidified atmosphere of 10 CO2 in air, and 3 TGF beta activity was determined in the presence of EGF 2.5 ng ml . Samples were sterilized in 1 M acetic acid and freeze dried in the presence of bovine serum albumin 100 vg as carrier prior to analysis. Stained colonies were quantitated by number and size.One unit of TGF beta activity is defined as that biological response resulting in 50 of maximal colony formation colony size 3000 pom2 in the presence ofEpidermal Growth Factor EGF 2.5 ng ml . The maximal response of the assay is about 2500 colonies 3000 ism2 per dish. Mitogen Assay NRK fibroblasts were suspended in medium Dulbecco s Modified Eagles Medium supplemented with 100 units per ml penicillin and 100 g per ml streptomycin , 10 in calf serum. Cells 4 x 103 in 0.1 ml were seeded in 96 well microtitre plates and incubated overnight. All incubations proceeded at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere of 10 C02 in air. The resulting monolayers were washed twice with 0.2 ml portions of serum free medium and once with 0.2 ml of medium containing 0.2 calf serum. DME, 0.2 in calf serum 100 pal , was added to the washed monolayers. The cells were incubated for 3 4 days during which time they reached about 75 confluency. Test samples 50 iil, freeze dried from 1 M acetic acid and redissolved in 20 pl of sterile 4 mM HC1 and 40 p1 of serum free medium were added to the growth arrested cells. After incubation 17 h , 3H thymidine 80 Ci mmol was added 1 pCi in 50 pl of serum free medium . Four hours later the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed 10 min at 4 C with ice cold 5 trichloroacetic acid 0.2 ml . Fixed cells were washed 4 times with 0.2 ml portions of 5 trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated radioactivity was solubilized by incubation in 0.5 M NaOH 0.15 ml per well for 30 min at 370 C . Amino Acid Analysis The amino acid composition of purified TGF beta 5 20 pmo.l was determined by hydrolysis 24 h at llO0C in vacuo with 6 N HC1 containing a trace amount of phenol. Analysis was performed on a modified amino acid analyzer using o phthalaldehyde reagent, a fluorometer, and the following sodium citrate buffers pH 3.28 adjusted to pH 3.25 by addition of 300 P1 of 6 N HC1 and 18 ml isopropanol per 900 ml buffer , pH 4.25, and pH 7.4. To remove trace amounts of free amino acids from preparations of TGF beta, the peptide solution 10 50 pmol in 0.1 0.5 ml of 1 M acetic acid was dialyzed in a microdialysis unit against 1 M acetic acid prepared withHPLC grade water.Contaminating amino acids remaining after dialysis were quantitated by analyzing equivalent amounts ofTGF beta with and without hydrolysis. The amount of each amino acid in the unhydrolyzed sample was about 5 of that in the hydrolyzed sample except for serine 15 and glycine 20 . B Functional Characteristics of Platelet DerivedTGF Beta The biological properties of purified, platelet derived TGF beta are shown below in Table 1. In the presence of EGF, the TGF elicits near maximal transforming activity at a concentration of 1 ng ml. In agreement with the data of others using impure TGF beta, the activity of the growth factor is destroyed by reduction stimulation of colony formation by an EGF reduced TGF beta mixture was no greater than that of EGF alone. Moreover,TGF beta, assayed in the absence of EGF, gave the basal level shown by 10 calf serum of transforming activity.Other experiments showed that TGF beta 1 ng ml does not compete for the binding of 125I labeled EGF to the EGF receptor. TGF beta can be detected in the platelet extract at protein concentrations showing no mitogenic activity. Table 1 shows that purified TGF beta 1 ng ml does not stimulate 3H thymidine incorporation into NRK fibroblasts despite the fact that these cells respond to established mitogens. Decreased 3H thymidine incorporation, relative to basal was observed with TGF beta when used at concentrations greater than 0.1 ng ml. At no concentration tested 0.01 10 ng ml did the TGF stimulate 3H thymidine incorporation. In addition to confirming that platelet derived TGF beta is biologically distinct from PDGF, these data suggest that the role of TGF beta in inducing cell growth in soft agar may be unrelated to a direct stimulation of total DNA synthesis. The sensitivity of TGF beta to treatment with dithiothreitol Table 1 indicates that disulfide bonds likely play an important role in conferring structure to the molecule. The molecular weight of platelet derived TGF beta, as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is affected by treatment with reductant.This result indicates that the native protein Mr 25,000 is composed of two polypeptide chains of very similar molecular weight Mr 12,500 which are maintained in covalent association by disulfide bonds. The inability to detect contaminants in the presence as well as absence of reductant further confirms the purity of the protein. Table 2 shows the amino acid composition of purified, platelet derived TGF beta obtained after hydrolysis of the polypeptide in acid. As expected from the data of Table 1, half cystine is present. The analysis differs from that of PDGF in the number of Thr, Glu, Val,Ile, Tyr, and Arg residues present per mol protein.Importantly, TGF beta as about 10 more tyrosine residues per mol protein than does PDGF, indicating that the TGF does not arise from proteolysis of PDGF.

EGF was used at 2.5 ng ml, its concentration in the TGF beta bioassay. The growth factors were dissolved in 1 M acetic acid with 10 pg BSA as carrier and freeze dried prior to analysis.To prepare reduced TGF beta, the lyophilized growth factor and BSA carrier were treated with a molar excess of dithiothreitol 0.05 M in 0.2 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 3 h at 370C . The solution of reduced TGF beta was acidified with acetic acid 40 it , dialyzed against 1 M acetic acid in a microdialysis unit, and freze dried prior to analysis. EGF was added to the sample after dialysis. A mock reduction performed in the absence of dithiothreitol had no effect on TGF beta transforming activity. In the mitogen assay, the basal level of 3H thymidine incorporation determined in the absence of mitogen was 9000 10,000 CPM.The mitogenic activity of TGF beta was not determined ND in the presence of EGF.

TGF Beta Derived from Placenta The acid ethanol extract of human placenta displayed activity that stimulated anchorage dependent NRK cells to form colonies in soft agar. EGF markedly enhanced 150 fold the activity of this placental TGF. As has been previously demonstrated for other TGFs, the activity of a partially purified placental preparation was destroyed by treatment with either trypsin or dithiothreitol. Chromatography of the undialyzed crude residue from the combined acid ethanol extractions of 11 placentas on a column in 1 M acetic acid gave two peaks of activity when assayed in the presence of EGF pool A, apparent Mr 5,000 9,000 and pool C, apparent Mr less than 3500 . No colony stimulating activity was detected when equivalent aliquots were assayed in the absence of EGF. Therefore, all subsequent soft agar assays were performed in the presence of 2 ng ml EGF. None of the 3 pools competed with 125I EGF for EGF membrane receptor sites on CCL 64 cells. The placenta derived TGF of the present invention is therefore clearly a member of the TGF beta family. Pool A, which contained 47 of the recovered protein, had 17 of the recovered TGF beta activity seeTable 4 while pool C, with only 3.3 of the protein, contained 18 of the recovered activity. Pool B did not give a valid assay for TGF activity because of the presence of a growth inhibitory substance. This inhibitor could be separated from the soft agar colony forming activity by further chromatography. As indicated in Table 4, 69 of theTGF activity found in the crude residue was present in the pool B fraction that eluted from the column. Pools B and C were therefore used for further purification. Application of the protein from the gel filtration column to a cation exchange column, and subsequent elution of the applied material w ith a linear sodium chloride gradient, gave a single peak of soft agar colony forming activity. Although 85 96 of the applied protein was recovered from the column, only 10 45 of the applied TGF activity was detected. Whether this loss of activity is due to specific loss of the TGF protein, to denaturation of theTGF, or to the separation of the TGF from an activator is, at this time, not clear. Fractions were pooled and chromatographed on high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC column using an acetonitrile 0.1P TFA gradient. The TGF activity for both pools eluted from the column as a single peak at an acetonitrile concentration of 35 . Rechromatography of this material on a CN support equilibrated in n propanol O.ls TFA yielded a single peak of TGF activity at 35 n propanol which corresponded to a strong absorbance peak. The homogeneity of the final preparation was indicated by a constant amino acid composition Table 5 across the peak as well as by gel electrophoresis. The final degree of purification of placenta derived TGF beta from the crude extract was 110,000 124,000 fold with a 1.1 recovery of activity in pool C and 4.8 in pool B.Only 64 72 pg ml of placental TGF beta was needed to obtain a half maximal growth stimulatory response ED50 in the presence of 2 ng ml of EGF. The purity of the final TGF preparation was also demonstrated by NaDodSO4 polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. In the absence of beta mercaptoethanol, a single polypeptide band with an apparent molecular weight of 23,000 25,000 was observed for TGF from either pool B or pool C. Reduction of the protein with beta mercaptoethanol produced a single band at approximately 13,000 molecular weight. When the gel was sliced into 0.5 cm strips and the unreduced protein eluted into 1 M acetic acid, all the TGF activity was found in the slice that corresponded to a molecular weight of 23,000 25,000, clearly indicating that the TGF activity corresponded to the only detectable protein band.Thus, the purified, placenta derived transforming growth factor of the present invention is a protein of molecular weight 23,000 25,000 and is composed of two polypeptide chains of approximately 13,000 molecular weight held together by disulfide linkages. Whether these chains are identical or different remains to be determined.Although the protein contains 16 half cystine residues, it is not yet known whether all of these residues are involved in disulfide linkage. However, the extreme stability of theTGFs to acid treatment and heat denaturation suggests the presence of a large number of such bonds. A Examples of Placenta Derived TGF BetaExtraction, Purification, and Analysis Soft Agar Assay Soft agar colony forming activity was determined as described previously except that the cells were stained at the end of one week in assay and the number and size of the colonies were determined using image analysis system. Extraction Normal term human placentas were frozen on dry ice within 30 minutes after delivery and stored at 600C until used. Placentas were extracted using a procedure previously described in Roberts, et al., Proc.Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77 3494 3498 1980 , except that the homogenized tissue 600 lOOOg was stirred in the acid ethanol solution at room temperature for 2 to 3 hr prior to centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was adjusted to pH 3.0 and protein precipitated with ether and ethanol. The precipitate was collected by filtration and redissolved in 1 M acetic acid 1 ml g of tissue . Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, the supernatant lyophilized and the residue 27 mg per gram wet weight placenta stored at 200C. Gel Filtration Chromatography The lyophilized extract 239 g from 11 placentas 8.8 kg was redissolved in 1 M acetic acid 50 mg residue per ml and applied in two separate portions 107 g and 132 g residue to a column 35.6 x 90 cm containing acrylamide gel 100 200 mesh, equilibrated and eluted 1.6L hr with 1 M acetic acid at room temperature. Fractions 800 ml were collected and aliquots of the even numbered fractions were assayed for protein and for growth promoting activity in soft agar. The fractions containing TGF activity were combined into three separate pools A C and lyophilized. Pool B 6 g residue per column was redissolved in 1 M acetic acid 60 mg ml and applied to a column 10 x 91 cm containing P 6 acrylamide gel equilibrated with 1 M acetic acid.The protein was eluted from the column with 1 M acetic acid 150 ml hr , collecting 37 ml fractions. Aliquots of even numbered fractions were assayed for TGF activity. The fractions containing this activity were pooled and lyophilized. Ion Exchange Chromatography Twenty four percent of pool B from the P 6 column 2.1 g protein and pool C from the P 30 column 1.9 g protein were redissolved separately in60 ml 0.01 M acetic acid. The pH was adjusted to 4.5 and the conductivity to 1.2 1.5 mS cm. Each sample was then applied to a cation exchange column CM Trisacryl M, LKB, 5 x 10 cm equilibrated in 0.05 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5 buffer A . The column was eluted with 300 ml of buffer A 145 ml hr followed by a linear sodium chloride gradient to 0.70 M sodium chloride in buffer A at 0.8 mM min. After 70 fractions 29 ml fraction , the column was washed with 1 M sodium chloride, 0.05 M sodium acetate, pH 2.5 and then reequilibrated with buffer A. Aliquots from the even numbered fractions were removed for determination of protein and TGF activity.The peak of activity was combined for further analysis. Reverse Phase HPLC The sample from the ion exchange column was made 10 v v in acetonitrile, 0.1 v v in trifluoroacetic acid TFA and the pH adjusted to 2.0. It was then pumped onto an HPLC column 10 vm particle size, 0.78 x 30 cm equilibrated in acetonitrile water TFA 10 90 0.1 , pH 2. After washing the sample onto the column with 50 ml of the initial solvent, the column was eluted 1.2 ml min with a 60 min linear gradient from 25 75 0.1 to 45 55 0.1 acetonitrile water TFA, pH 2. After 75 fractions 1.2 ml fraction the column was stripped with acetonitrile water TFA 80 20 0.1 , pH 2, collecting 2.4 ml fractions. Aliquots 5 P1 were removed for assay of TGF activity. The peak of TGF activity from the HPLC column was combined, lyophilized, redissolved in n propanol water TFA 30 70 0.1 , pH 2, and applied to a CN column 10 pm particle size, 0.38 x 30 cm equilibrated with the sample solvent. The column was then eluted 1.1 ml min with a 153 min linear gradient from 30 70 0.1 to 45 55 0.1 n propanol water TFA, pH 2. Forty five fractions 2.2 ml fraction were collected and aliquots were removed for bioassay, amino acid analysis, and gel electrophoresis. NaDodSO4 Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis Samples were analyzed on f.5 mm slab gels using either a polyacrylamide gradient of 15 to 28 or a 15 polyacrylamide gel and a discontinuous buffer system. Proteins were fixed with formaldehyde and stained using a silver staining technique. In some cases, samples were boiled with 5 beta mercaptoethanol for 3 min prior to application to the gel. Other Procedures Total protein was determined either by the dye binding method or fluorescamine assay using bovine serum albumin as standard or by amino acid analysis. Quantitative amino acid analyses were done with a modified amino acid analyzer equipped with a fluorometer for the detection of primary amines using o phthalaldehyde reagent solution and a computing integrator. Lyophilized samples 7 40 picomoles were hydrolyzed in 100 u L constant boiling HC1 containing 0.1t liquid phenol at 1500 for 2 hr in sealed, evacuated tubes. These modified conditions of shortened hydrolysis at elevated temperature yielded results for several test proteins which were identical to or better than those obtained after conventional acid hydrolysis 1100, 24 48 hr . Assays for EGF competing activity were performed as previously described. A summary of a general extraction procedure found to be preferable to previously used procedures, is given below. Example of a Placenta Derived TGF Beta Extraction Protocol 1. Placentas are placed on dry ice immediately after delivery and are stored at 700C or colder until used. 2. Approximately 24 hr before extraction, thaw placentas at 200C. 3. Chop 1 kg of placenta into pieces and place into extraction solution 4 L solution kg tissue . Extraction solution 3189 ml 95 ethanol 770 ml water 66 ml concentrated HC1 210 mg phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 12 mg pepstatin A 4. Mince in a blender to give a slurry. 5. Stir slurry at room temperature for approximately 2 1 2 hr requires heavy duty stirrer . 6. Centrifuge 17,000 x g 10 min Discard pellet, save supernatant. 7. Adjust the supernatant to pH 3.0 with concentrated ammonium hydroxide. 8. Add 0.55 volume of 5.5 M Nazi. 9. Precipitate overnight at 4 C. 10. Centrifuge 17,700 x g 10 min. Discard pellet, save supernatant. 11. Concentrate supernatant to 1 5 volume or less. We used a hollow fiber concentrator with a 5000 MW nominal cutoff membrane . 12. Add 2 volumes 5.5 M NaCl to concentrated supernatant. 13. Precipitate overnight at 40C. 14. Centrifuge 17,700 x g 10 min. Discard supernatant. Save pellet for gel filtration chromatography and further purification. Table 4. Purification of TGF Beta from Human Placenta.

Biophys. Res. Commun.106 354 361 1982 . In the TGF of the present invention, a significant amount of TGF a like activity was not detected.Although some soft agar colony forming activity was found in the crude residue in the absence of EGF, this activity did not compete with EGF in a receptor binding assay and it was stimulated 150 fold by the addition of 2 ng ml of EGF, indicating that most, if not all, of the TGF present was of the type beta class. Also, as the placental TGF was purified, it became totally dependent on exogenous EGF for soft agar colony forming activity. Part of this difference may be explained by the fact that in Stromberg, et al. 1982 colonies of 6 cells or greater were considered to be significant while for the present invention colonies had to contain at least 60 cells in order to be counted. Because placenta contains much blood, it is possible that the placental TGF beta of the present invention 10 ng per gram of tissue originated from the platelets. However, even assuming that the placenta was 100 blood and that platelets comprised 0.2 of this blood, platelet TGF would account for only 8 of the recovered placental TGF. Also, blood platelets contain another peptide, platelet derived growth factor PDGF . However, placental TGF beta is notPDGF, as clearly demonstrated by the amino acid composition of TGF beta Table 2 , which is different from that reported for PDGF, and by the results from two different assays. In the first assay s placental TGF beta did not have any chemotactic activity when tested under conditions where PDGF displayed strong chemotactic activity. Similarly, placentalTGF beta did not compete with PDGF in a radioreceptor assay.
