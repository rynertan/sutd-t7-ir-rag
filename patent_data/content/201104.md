# Acoustical panel.

## Abstract
A movable, prefabricated wall panel having a rigid rect angular frame. A core structure 19 is disposed in the re gion bounded by the frame 16 , which core structure 19 preferably comprises at least one honeycomb layer 21 . Sheetlike skins 22 are fixedly secured to opposite sides of the frame 16 and extend across the region bounded by the frame 16 for confining the honeycomb layer 21 therebe tween. A plurality of small openings 26 27 are formed in either or both of the skins 22 so that they communicate with cells 23 on the honeycomb layer 21 to create Helm holtz sound absorbing chambers. Each sheetlike 22 skin is covered by a layer of porous fiberglass material for absorb ing sound, which layer includes an inner thin mat of high density fiberglass 33 which is in turn covered by a relative ly thick outer layer of low density fiberglass 34 . This outer layer 34 ha a variable density gradient across the thick ness thereof, which density gradient progressively in creases across the thickness toward the mat.
