## Description
Description of the patent for an industrial invention entitled Method and device for cleaning rotors in spinning machines of the open end type . It is known that with spinning machines of the open end type, whenever the yarn breaks, all the imparities and fibres present in the rotor have to be removed before carrying out re attachment of the broken yarn. By re attachment we mean the several oDerations, which may be carried out by hand or automatically, necessary for the spinning process to be re started. Briefly, the operations to be carried out are the following recovery of the yarn on the bobbin onto which it is being wound introduct ion of the yarn into the spinning chamber activation of the feed of the fibres rapid extraction of the yarn which has by now been connected. It may also be necessary to cause a preventive break it the yarn so as to clean the rotor when tt is wished that the quality of the yarn should remain better than the specified limits laid down. In fact it is known that, as time gqes by the quantity of impurities which build up in the rotor increases and causes a more and more noticeable decline in the quality of the yarn produced. In the present state of the art the residual impurities and fibres are removed by means of various manual or automatic systems. When the rotor is cleaned by hand, the operatorin charge opens the spinning unit and thereby causes the rotor to stop he then cleans the inside of the rotor with a brush and or spatula without removing it from its seating. If an automatic device is envisaged for the cleaning of the rotors, the operation is carried out in this case with means pre arranged either in each unit or on a movable trolley which can work along the whole machine. The means known so far are brushes, spatulas, air blowers, jets of liquid and .suction elements, and said means. can be used individually or .jointly. Basically, with the present known state of the art, the cleaning is done with means which depend on the system em ployed, with the unit open or closed, but in all cases with out the rotor being removed. The foregoing cleaning method involves a series of shortcomings, amongst which is the long time needed to re start .production of the spinning unit when the yarn breaks, for it .is hard especially with waxy or very dirty materials to eliminate readily and wholly all the impurities which have been deposited in and are adhering to the inside of the rotar furthermore, periodical maintenance of the unit is required,and the rotor has to be disassembled and cleaned thoroughly. The main purpose of this invention is to eliminate or reduce as much as possible all the drawbacks arising from the known cleaning systems. In accordance with said purpose the invention has as its objects a method and the relative device to carry out that method according to said method, only a dirty rotor or a rotor complete with a relative support is replaced automat ically by a clean rotor, and thereafter the dirty rotor is cleaned and made available as a replacement for another rotor. The replacing operation is particularly easy in spinning .untts suitably pre arranged or provided with removable rotors, .such as is the case, for instance, in units equipped with .the so called indirect support . The invention also comprises a device with a movable .trolley to carry out the aforesaid method, whereby said de Device is characterized by including means suitable for keep ing in a continuous traversing movement along the working face or faces of one or more machines a trolley and some means fitted to halt the movement thereof in front of the unit where the yarn is broken or in front of a unit which it is .wished to clean furthermore, said trolley is characterized .by the fact that it is provided with grasping means able to take and remove the rotor from the machine, following on the .opening of the corresponding unit, so as to transfer said rotor to a cleaning group and to replace it quickly with a clean rotor, whilst the cleaning group takes steps to clean the dirty rotor thoroughly with suitable means which are not restricted by the structural geometry of the machine the .trolley carries out said operations in the time required for .them but not limited by the production requirements, another feature of the device which carries out the method that is our object lies in the fact that the trolley forming a part of the device, besides being equipped with cleaning organs, is also provided with means able to hold or store temporarily one or more rotors, after the latter have been removed and cleaned, so as to make the replacement of dirty rotors a quicker operation. The more evident characteristics of the invention are described hereinafter with reference to the attached drawings, which are given for demonstration purposes only and wherein Fig.I is a diagrammatic view of a device with a trolley according to the method which is our object as applied to an open end spinning machine Figs. 2 3 give a diagrammatic representation of two successive phases of the working cycle of the cleaning unit .linked to the trolley Fig.4 is a side view of a rotating turret means provided .with means for grasping a rotor of an open end unit Fig.5 is a front view of the turret means of Fig.4 Figs.6 to 9 show in a diagrammatic manner the main phases of the working cycle by the activation of which the turret .means shown in Figs.4 5 replaces a dirty rotor with a clean rotor in an open end spinning un.it Fig.IO gives a perspective of a detail linked to the .cleaning trolley fitted on an open end spinning machine Figs.II, 12 13 show in a diagrammatic manner the main phases of the working cycle set in operation by the detail represented in Fig. 10, following on which a dirty rotor re moved on the turret means is replaced with a clean rotor Fig. 14 is a perspective and diagrammatic view of one type of indirect support Fig.I5 gives a diagrammatic representation of another known kind of gas type support Fig. 16 gives a diagrammatic representation of a known .type of active magnetic support Fig.I7 is a d iagrammatIc perspective of a non restrict ive example of the means that permit a rotor to be withdrawn jointly with the corresnonding support Fig. 18 shows diagrammatically a plan view on a small scale of the positions which can be taken up by the cleaning device in respect of a spinning machine. We must begin by saying that Fig.I4 shows diagrammatically a known indirect support, wheretn I. indicates the spinning rotor solidly fixed to the shaft 2 set in rotation andkept tn position by the wheels 3 3a and belt 4, whilst the wheel 5, which acts as a thrust bearing, determines the axial position of the shaft 2 and rotor I Fig.I5 gives a diagram of another known type of indirect support working by means of a cushion of gas introduced into the chambers 6 6a which support the shaft 2 solidly fixed to the rotor I likewise Fig.I6 is a diagram of a known indirect support working by means of an active magnetic field generated by the stators 7 7a. In all the examples shown in Figs.14, 15 16 and in other known cases which we have not shown, provided that the rotor I can be withdrawn from its tndirect support together with the shaft 2, it can be subjected to the method and the cleaning device which are our subject. With reference to Fig.I, II is an open end spinning mach ine provided with spools 12, of which each is installed on a swinging arm IS. From the container C the sliver D is fed to the corresponding spinning unit consisting of the rotor I . mounted on its indirect support and of the spinning chamber group and organs to open the fibres, the whole being protected by the cover 14 represented with continuous lines in its open position and with lines of dashes in the position It takes up when the rotor is active. The spinning machine II is provided, for instance, with immovable lengthwise rails 15 16 engaged with sliding means 17 18 solidly fixed to the trolley 19, which thus runs along the front of the spinning machine II and, therefore, along a plurality of spinning stations I to 14 aligned along.said spinning machine. The trolley 19 is driven along the rails 15 16 by mot or organs governed by automatic devices controlled by suit able sensors linked to a programmer means and comprises a two way hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder 21 mounted immovably .on the trolley 19, whereby the piston rod 22 of the cylinder has its end 20 solidly fixed to a small trolley 23 equipped with turret means 24 that can turn around the axis of its sloping shaft 25 said turret means 24, which in the instance shown has a quadrangular plan and trapezoidal crosswise sectlions but which could have any other shape such as that of a .truncated cone, bears on each of its sloped side faces 24a Figs.4 5 a grasping organ 26, such as an expansion type mandrel for example, which is able to hold temporarily a rotor I from any spinning station forming part of a spinning .machine II. Each trolley 19 is also equipped with a two way cylinder .28 having a vertical axis and a piston, of which the rod 29, is mounted so as to be able to revolve and run within a sleeve 30 and is solidly fixed to a horizontal arm SI provided with gasping organs 32 situated symmetrically opposite to each pother in respect of the axis of said cylinder 28 and at such a distance from each other that in the position shown in Figs.I 3 one of the organs 32 is vertically aligned with the grasping organ 26 borne on the upwards facing side 24a of the turret means 24 when the small trolley 23 is in its posts ion furthest away from the spinning station, whereas the other opposed organ 32 is vertically aligned with the cavity of a washing vessel 33 located at a height convenient for the pur poses described hereinafter. The small shift 25 of the turret means 24 receives from the small trolley 23 rotational impulses for arcs of 90 the small shaft. 30 solidly fixed to the arm 32, besides carrying out an alternating movement in a vertical direction, receives impulses of rotational movement in one single direction cover ing arcs of 180 all the movements are automatic and take place at programmed twines. The working of the device described so far ts as follows the trolley I9 moves along the rails 15 16 Fig.I and istable to reach and stop in front of any of the spinning stat ions I toI4 of the spinning machine II having reached the unit where it is desired or is necessary to replace the rotor because the latter Is dirty, It halts thereafter, by meansof devices not shown here, tt opens the cover 14 automatic ally and brings It from the position shown with lines of dashes to that shown with continuous lines it arranges to stop the rotor I and to ratse the. tangential belt 4. There latter the cylinder 21 brings back its own piston and takes the rod 22 from the position of Fig.I to that of Fig.2 to gether with the small trolley 23. and turret means 24 the latter has a grasping organ 26 which is free and has its own horizontal axis in a position coaxial with the small shaft 2 of the rotor I which has to be cleaned, whilst at least one of its other grasping organs 26 bears a clean rotor Ia 2a Figs.6 to 9 inclusive . At the moment when the small trolley 23 and turret means 24 move forwards, the latter is In its position of Fig.6 in relation to the unit concerned and indicated with 33 fn Figs. .6 to 9 inclusive. The free grasping organ 26 is aligned with the rotor I 2 and moves forward with the small trolley 23 until it .seizes the rotor in programmed sequence thereafter the cyl .inder 21 arranges to bring back the whole group comprising .the small trolley 23 together with the turret means 24 to .the starting position as shown tn Fig.3. In this latter postt .ton the rotor I 2 is wholly withdrawn from the correspond .ing spinning unit. Thereafter the turret means 24 rotates in an anti clockwise direction, as regards Fig.3 and Figs.6 to 9 tnclusive, through an arc of 90 and thereby brings the clean .rotor Ia 2a, with which it was provided, to the position of the dirty rotor I 2.Thereafter the cylinder 21 brings the small trolley 23, turret means 24 and rotor Ia 2a back .again to the position of Fig.2 or else to a position advanced towards the unit previously deprived of the rotor I 2. The clean rotor is thus positioned on the support 3, 3a, 4 and 5, and the small trolley 23 returns to its initial backward po sitlon, while the cover 14 is closed. The trolley 19 ts thus free to restart its traversing movement along the front of the spinning machine II.When the small trolley 23 has taken .up again its backward position in relation to the front of the spinning machine II Figs.I 3 , the turret means 24 .completes a further angular movement of 90 in an anti clock .wise direction and brings a preuiously removed dirty rotor 1 2 into vertical alignment with one of the seizing organs .32 solidly fixed to the arm SI, which is associated with the rod 29 of the cylinder 28 the second seizing organ 32 of said arm 31 is vertically aligned with the bath or cleaning unit 33.At that moment the cylinder 28 is activated and .thrusts the rod 29 and arm 31 downwards until they bring the seizing organ 32, which is aligned with the small shaft 2 .of the rotor 1 2, into contact with the end thereof said seizing organ grips the end of said small shaft 2, whilst thereafter the seizing organ 26 of the turret means 24,which .was gripping the rotor I, frees the latter.The essential phases of the working cycle of the mov ..able group comprising the cylinder 28, arm SI and seizing .organs 32 are shown in Figs.lI, 12 IS. As can be seen in Fig. II, it is preferable that the seizing organ 32 aligned vertically with the cleaning bath 33 should always carry a rotor Ia 2a which has already been cleaned, the object being to carry out a quick replacement of the dirty rotor I 2 already removed, which, as is shown in Fig.12, Is withdrawn by the arm 31 and replaced Fig.13 at once by a rotor ration of 180 and a successive lowering of the arm itself. By an operation of this kind the twofold purpose is fulfilled of supplying the turret means 24 again at once with a cleanrotor and of subjecting the dirty rotor at the same time to .cleaning operations in the cleaning bath 33. Clearly, the .cylinder 28 can ratse the arm 31 moderately so as to disen gage the end of the small shaft 2a of the rotor Ia which has .been cleaned and taken by one of the organs 26 of the turret .means 24, whilst the dirty rotor I 2 is allowed to remain sunder the action of the cleaning unit 33.It is also clear .that both the seizing organs 26 of the turret means 24 and .the seizing organs 32 of the arm SI can be activated and disactivated independently, while adl their diverse movements are automatic and are coordinated owing to the employment of known devices. According to an evident variant the cleaning operation .can be carried out at one or more unmoving stations located along the path of the trolley I9 Fig.18 at one or more of the points indicated with numbers from I to VI inclusive and .provided with cleaning means and with means to collect and discharge rotors onto and from the trolley 19, which in such a case is equipped with means 21, 22, 23 24 to remove dirty rotors and instal clean rotors but lacks the cleaning unit 28 SI. Depending on the number of operations which the trolley 9 can be foreseen to have to carry out during its run in reelation to the structure and lay out of the spinning machines Fig.18 and also in relation to the capacity of the storage means, the cleaning unit, I to VI inclusive, is positioned suitably. In particular, If the capacity of the trolley is enough to serve two or more machines, the cleaning unit may be positioned at any of the stations indicated with numbers from . I to VI inclusive in Fig.I8 if the capacity of the trolley. is enough for only one machine, the unit can be at I and IV or II and V or III and VI, whereas if the capacity of the .trolley Is enough for only one face of a machine, then the unit will have to be at I and III for the first machine and .at It and VI for the second machine.The determination of the .capacity of the tanks needed to serve a certain number of spinning units without stopping at the cleaning station can .be calculated with the following formula N x n x t C S 1000 60 x 1000 where in c capacity of the tank S stock of rotors X number of operations to be carried out per 1000 spindles per hour n number of units to be served t average time in minutes needed by the trolley to keepI000 spinning units In production including supervision and machine operations . Rith reference to Fig.I7, which shows a rotor I with a .conventional support 8, 9 is a part of the spinning unit .solidly fixed to the spinning machine frame II, whilst 10 is a pair of removable pivots on which the bosses 8a of the supsport 8 can be hinged at IOa. By realising a solution of this kind or any other solution able to permit the rotor to be withdrawn together with .its corresponding support and by equipping the trolley 19 adequately, the method an 7 the device which are our subject cdn also be used advantageously with spinning units having rotors with a direct, rigid support. Clearly, the invention is not limited by what has been described and shown for demonstration purposes alone but can be applied to all practical realizations that are comprised within the scope of the method which is the subject of the Invention.
