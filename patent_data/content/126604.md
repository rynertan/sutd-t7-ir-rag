## Description
BACKGROUND TO TEE INVENTION TillS ISYESTIOS relates to conveyor idlers or rollers of the type adapted to support conveyor belts used in mining, industrial and like applications. Conveyor rollers generally comprise a rigid sleeve or drum which is rotatably mounted buy means of suitable bearings on a shaft, the shaft being supported in a cradle or frame which in turn is mounted to a foundation. Generally the sleeve is formed from a steel tube. Problems with steel or metal sleeves occur when the idler jams due to bearing seizure or for other reasons. When this occurs, tne belt runs over a stationary idler causing the steel sleeve to heat up and wear away, resulting in the belt being damaged. Other problems arise when the conveyor is carrying uneven loads which from a protruberance on the underside of the belt which impinges on the conveyor idler as the protruberance passes over the idler. This can cause denting of the sleeve as well as jolting and possible damage to the bearing assembly. Further problems with conventional rollers occur because the outer surface of the sleeve is not absolutely concentric with the axis of rotation.Rotation of an eccentric roller causes rapid deterioration of the bearing assembly as well as setting up harmonic vibrations in the belt. Also, because the steel sleeve is smooth, the belt will tend to wander relative to the idler which is considered undesirable. In attempts to alleviate at least some of the abovementioned problems conveyor idlers have been developed being formed of or having a outer cover of rubber of soft plastics which absorbs some of the shocks to which conveyor idlers are subjected. In this regard reference may be made ot British PatentsNo s 1076499, 1319 316, 1344 533, 1366 389 and 1405 679. In particular British Patents No 1076499 describes a roller having a cylindrical drum covered with a rubber sleeve. The drum is supported off its bearings by means of rubber rings. A problem with rubber or like synthetic plastics materials such as polyethelene is that once the roller jams, the relative movement between belt and stationary roller causes rapid breakdown of the cover, eventually leading to damage to the belt. Also, such materials tend not to be dimensionally stable, and as soon as an eccentricity occurs in the roller, further rotation causes rapid deterioration of the eccentric condition. It is an object of the invention to provide a conveyor idler wnich runs smoothly and whicn has superior wear or operational characteristics in at least some applications. According to the invention there is provided a conveyor roller comprising a drum rotatably supported on a shaft by a bearing assembly, the drum comprising a right circular cylindricalP7 ,1 tubular inner sleeve formed of metal, and a coaxial right circular cylindrical outer sleeve formed of a hard, wear resistant, plastics material. Preferably tne hard plastics sleeve will De self supporting and tne metal sleeve will be formed of thin steel tube. Further there is provided for the plastics material to have self lubricating cnaracteristics. Specifically it is envisaged tnat the plastics material will nave physical characteristics similar to that of rigid polyvinyl cnloride rigid PVC , polypropylene, or high density polyethelene. Further there is provided for the outer surface of the drum to be machine turned such that the axis of the outer surface is concentric with tne axis of rotation of the roller. During turning a fine helical groove or a plurality of concentric cirucular grooves may be cut into the outer surface of the plastics sleeve, along substantially the entire length of the sleeve. The fine groove will not materially affect frictional resistances to movement tangentally to the sleeve but will increase frictional resistance to movement parallel to the axis of rotation of the idler The bearing assembly by means of which the drum is supported on the shaft may comprise a pair of roller bearings preferably mounted in end caps formed of a hard plastics material. The plastics material of the end caps may be a nylon 66 derivative and will preferably be moulded to the required shape.The shape may include a ribbed formation. It is envisaged that the plastics material of the sleeve will have characteristics substantially as follows mass density 1350 1460 kg m3 heat reversion less than 3.08 specific neat capacity 0,85 2.10 kJ kg C vicat softening point 82 85 tensile strength commat 20 C 56 MPa at yield modulus of elasticity 3,2 GPa comprehensive strength 80 IAPa Further tnere is provided for the polymeric sleeve to comprise a length of rigid PVC piping which during assembly of the idler is heat shrunk onto the metal sleeve. This material is suitable as it has a low coefficient of friction with a conveyor belt. It will also be possible for tne plastics sleeve to have electrically conductive particles interspersed tnerethrougn which will assist in reducing electrostatic buildup on the roller in use. The end caps may be press fitted into the drum or alternatively may be screwed into thread formations formed on the inner surface of the drum. The invention extends to a method of assembling a conveyor roller, the conveyor roller in tne assembled condition comprising a right circular cylindrical drum having an inner sleeve formed of metal and an outer sleeve formed of hard plastics material, the drum being supported off a shaft by means of bearing assemblies located on the shaft near each end thereof, the bearing assemblies being mounted in suitable end caps which seat in each end of the drum, the method including the steps of 1 heating at least the outer sleeve, to a condition of slignt plasticity, 2 placing the sleeves in end to end coaxial relationship 3 urging the outer sleeve over the inner sleeve such that the two sleeves are concentric thereby forminy a composite drums and 4 allowing the composite drum to cool. Further in accordance with this aspect of the invention there is provided for the method to include the steps of inserting centering means into the composite drum and rotating the drum about its axis, a cutting tool being used to shave a layer off the outer surface of tne outer sleeve. Alternatively the cutting tool may be rotated around the drum. The cutting tool may be used to cut a circular or helical groove into tne outer surface of the outer sleeve. The urging of the outer sleeve over the inner sleeve may be achieved with the aid of an hydraulic ram or other mechanically assisting device.BRIEF DESCRIPTIQG OF TIRE DRawINGs The invention as described below by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a part cut away isometric view of a conveyor roller1 Figure 2 shows a part cut away side elevation of a conveyor roller assembling device, Figure 3 shows a plan view of the device of Figure 2, and Figure 4 shows an enlarged side view of tne drum of a conveyor roller before assembly. DETAIT Uen DESCRIPIIOS OF TEE DRARiBGS Referring initially to Figure 1, a conveyor roller comprises a rigid metal shaft 1 the ends 2 of which are snaped to fit into special formations on a support cradle not shown . A drum 3 is rotatably supported on the shaft 1 by means of bearings 4 which seat on suitable journaled formations on the shaft. A labyrinth type seal 5 situated between the bearings 4 and the end 2 of the shaft inhibits the inyress of foreign particles into the bearing 4. Tne bearing 4 is mounted in a suitable end cap or bearing housing 6 which fits into the end of the drum 3 to tnereby ensure that the drum 3 is rotatably mounted on the shaft 1.The end cap 6 may be a press fit into the end of the drum 3 or, suitable thread formations on the inner surface of the drum may be engaged by co operant thread formations thread formations formed on the outer surface of the end cap 6. The bearing 4 will preferably be a thrust roller bearing. Thread formations are shown at numeral 30. A cover plate 7 screws into thread formations in the end cap to further prevent the ingress of foreign particles into the bearing assembly. The drum 3 is a composite drum and comprises a inner metal sleeve 8 and an outer plastics sleeve 9. It is envisaged that the outer sleeve 9 will be formed of a rigid polyvinyl chloride uPVC , high density polyethelene, or polypropelene.Other materials which may be used are a suitableZytel a Dupont product . Preferably the outer sleeve will be formed of a plastics material which is sufficiently wear resistant to withstand the rigours of use as a conveyor roller, and will not be brittle. However, it is considered important that the plastics material will have self lubricating characteristics such that relative movement between a conveyor belt and the surface of the roller is possiDle without too severe frictional resistance to relative movement. It is envisaged that the end caps 6 will be moulded or otherwise formed from a nylon 66 derivative plastics material. This has the advantage in that sucn a material is to some extent resilient and thus shocks or transverse forces experienced by tne roller will to an extent be absorbed in the end caps ratner than being transferred directly to the bearings 5. The inner metal sleeve will preferably be formed of steel tube having a wall thickness of between 1 and 2 mm. The end caps 6 have a radially projecting lip 10 the thickness of the lip being similar to the thickness of the metal sleeve 8. Tnus, when the end cap is inserted in the end of drum 3 the lip 10 overlies the end of the metal sleeve and in this way corrosion of tne metal sleeve will be minimized. The end caps 6 may be formed having a multiplicity of cavities 11 formed tnerein which will reduce the quantity of plastics material needed to form an end cap as well as assistiny in providiny a resilient nature to the end cap. It will be appreciated that it is important that relative movement between the outer sleeve 9 and the inner sleeve 8 is not possible. For this reason it is advantageous if the outer sleeve can be tightly in contact with the inner sleeve 8. A most satisfactory method of manufacture which has been developed by applicant is to place tne inner and outer sleeves ln end on relationsnip in a suitable heating chamber. Thereafter, the two sleeves are heated and thereafter the outer sleeve is urged over the inner sleeve by compressing tne two sleeves together. The outer sleeve is heated to a temperaturewhicn allows the sleeve to become slightly plastic whereafter the sliding of the outer sleeve over the inner sleeve is possible.It will De appreciated that the diameter of the inner sleeve is the same or sligntly larger than the internal diameter of the outer sleeve such that when the outer sleeve cools down, the outer sleeve will neat shrink into fixed contact with the inner sleeve 8. It has been found that no bondiny material is required Detween the two sleeves. The apparatus for urging the two sleeves into coaxial allignment is shown in Figures 2 to 4.The apparatus comprises a metal frame 20 to wnidh a cylindrical heating chamber 21 has been mounted.Heating coils 22 located on the inner surface of the heating cnamber 21 are adapted to heat the interior of the heating chamber. An nydraulic piston and cylinder assembly 23 is mounted to the frame adjacent tne heating chamber and control means and timing devices 24 are used to vary the load, the temperature, and the time of operation of the device. A central rod 25 which extends tnrough the heating chamber 21 is adapted to have the drum of the conveyor roller threaded thereon The hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly is adapted to press the unassembled drum against a bulkhead 26 located on the opposite side of tne heating chamber from tne hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly. The drum prior to assembly is shown in Figure 4.It comprises the outer sleeve 9 and the inner sleeve 8 which are held concentric with tne elongate rod 25 Dy means of spacing elements 27. The spacing elements have formations which nold the sleeves in the correct position of end on alignment. Tne bulKhead 26 may nave a central portion 28 which may be removed in order to provide access to the heating chamber. This removable portion is shown more clearly in Figure 3.In use, after heating of the unassembled drum, the two spacing elements 27 will be urged together by means of the hydraulic piston and cylinder assembly which will cause the outer sleeve 9 to move over tne inner sleeve 8. Thereafter the drum will be removed or detacned from the spaciny elements 27 and the drum can be removed for further processiny. After assembly of the composite drum, the composite drum will be taken to a turning device such as a latne. Tne composite drum will be mounted on tne lathe in rotatable manner and thereafter a layer of pre determined tnickness will be shaved off the outer surface of the plastics outer sleeve. This turning of the composite drum will nave the affect of ensuring that the outer surface of the drum is concentric with the axis of rotation of the roller. In addition, it will ensure that the outer surface is round. It is envisaged that tne turning tool will form a nelical groove in the outer surface of the outer sleeve the said groove serving to improve tne cnaracteristics of travel of the belt over tne roller. It is envisaged that tne groove will to some extent, at least, prevent the belt wandering relative to tne conveyor roller. It has been found that a suitable plastics pipe may oe used to form tne outer sleeve.A suitable plastic pipe presently being used by applicant has physical properties as follows mass density 1350 1460 kg m3 heat reversion less than 3.0 specific heat capacity 0,85 2,10 kJ kg C vicat softening point 82 85 tensile strength commat 20 C 56 MPa at yield modulus of elasticity 3,2 GPa comprehensive strength 80 MPa It is envisaged that the metal inner sleeve will be formed of thin steel tubing. The steel tubing will serve as a support to tne plastics outer sleeve and as such will add tne strength to tne composite drum.Tne thin steel tube will not nowever be as thick as steel sleeves conventionally used with conveyor idlers and tnerefor the weignt of tne composite drum will be substantially the same or less than the weight of comparable steel drums. A further advantage of using thin steel tube is that should for some reason or other the conveyor roller jam, the thin steel tube will wear away relatively rapidly after the plastics outer layer has worn away. The wearing away of the steel tube within a short time will ensure that the belt is not damaged as has often happened with thicker steel rollers. In effect the thin steel tube will collapse after the belt has worn against the steel tube for any period of time.As previously mentioned, it is envisaged that because the outer layer is formed of a plastics material having suitable self lubricating characteristics the time taken to wear through the outer sleeve will be quite substantial and during normal maintenance checks the fact that a particular roller is not rotating should lead to the replacement of that particular roller before any damage can have been done. There may be many variations to the above described embodiment without departing from the scope of the invention. As previously mentioned, the material from which the outer sleeve 9 may be formed can be varied although it is important that the material is both hard and has self lubricating characteristics. Thus, the material will have a low co officient of friction relative to a conveyor belt. It will also be possible for the outer plastics sleeve 9 to have carbon powder, copper flakes or similar metalic filaments interspersed therein which will serve to reduce static build up on the roller. This may be an important aspect where the rollers are to be used in potentially combustive conditions. End caps which screw into the drum have an advantage in that the idler may be serviced or repaired in situ without specialist tools.
