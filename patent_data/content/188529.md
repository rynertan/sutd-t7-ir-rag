# ELECTROLYTE SOLUTIONS AND IN VITRO USE THEREOF

## Description
This invention lies in the field of The vital functions of highly developed organisms are closely dependent on the internal aqueous medium and on the maintenance in it of extreme constancy of chemical and physical properties. Typically In this disclosure we propose the first major basic advance in these solutions for the It has long been recognized that all animal intracellular and extracellular body fluids contain inorganic electrolytes, and that these electrolytes are involved in, and profoundly influence, various life processes. Attempts to make artificial electrolyte fluids which may bathe tissues or be administered to the human bloodstream have been known since about 1880, and, although modern analytical tools and procedures have clarified compositional details of blood electrolytes, the use of various aqueous electrolyte solutions for Those inorganic electrolytes characteristically found in normal human blood serum at respective concentration levels above about 1 millimole per liter are shown below in Table I. Also, for comparative purposes, in Table I are shown some representative compositions of various aqueous electrolyte solutions that have been previously prepared and used for Comtemporarily, a large number of different aqueous electrolyte solutions or their salt concentrates are prepared and sold in commerce, and used in Even a cursory examination of Table I will confirm the medical dicta that plasma is an unmakable solution . The solutions listed in Table I illustrate this belief. The essential problem is that plasma contains, in addition to major inorganic electrolytes, trace quantities of various electrolytes plus various metabolites including plasma proteins. In practice, it has not been possible to construct synthetically a replication of plasma extracellular fluid or intracellular fluid because of their complexity. Blood, extracellular and intracellular fluid, and even plasma can be regarded as tissues. In most prior art electrolyte solutions, the concentration of chloride anions Cl is higher than in human plasma or serum. For example, the Krebs Henseleit solution see Table I contains a concentration of Cl which is about 20 higher than in fluids such as plasma. This anion gap, that is, the difference between the positive cations and the negative anions, is now known to be due largely to the anionic metabolites in such fluids plus the contribution of acidic amino acid groups found on plasma proteins. Referring to Table I, it is seen that the total positive cations in, for example, human plasma is 142 154 meq l while the total anions is only about 128 137 meq l leaving a deficit of about 14 17 meq l of anions. For convenience, the anion gap in such fluids can be expressed as the ratio of sodium cation milliequivalents per liter to chloride anion milliequivalents per liter. From Table I, it is clear that the Kreb s Serum substitute Kreb s, H.A. The alternative to Krebs Henseleit is essentially Krebs Ringers Phosphate or Delbecco s tissue culture media where Pi is present in amounts about 10 to 25 times normal plasma concentrations. Such media are used so as to eliminate HCO₃ CO₂. Both such solutions, used respectively in perfusion or cell culture not only have too high Pi which induces an abnormal intracellular ΣATP ΣADP ΣPi ratio but also have too low a Na Cl ratio inducing hyperchloremic acidosis. The alternative use of lactate or pyruvate alone induces severe abnormalities in cellular redox state and phosphorylation potential. The use of gluconate induces abnormalities in the nexosemonophosphate pathway. Indeed, all previously used organic ions violate the safe entry points or the normal Na Cl ratio as herein defined. In addition to the use of lactate, gluconate, fumarate, glutamate, pyruvate, and citrate anions in current commercially available prior art electrolyte fluids, and wherein such anions are typically employed at levels above those found in the plasma or serum of healthy humans, many such prior art commercial fluids also employ high levels of nonionic metabolites, such as fructose and glycerol, which induce separate redox state and phosphorylation potential abnormalities of their own. Thus, fructose causes severe abnormalities in phosphorylation potential with rapid destruction of liver purine nucleotides and their release into blood sometimes leading to renal shutdown due to uric acid deposition in the kidneys see Woods, H.F., Eggleston, L.V., and Krebs, H.A. Mammalian systems normally operate at temperatures between about 37 38 C whereas, by common thermodynamic convention, neutral pH is taken to be about 7 at 25 C. It is clear that changes in pH, the negative log₁₀ of H concentration necessarily affect the fundamental energetic relationships occurring in living cells. Also, enzymes have sharply defined ranges of H concentration in which they perform their catalytic functions in a normal manner. Deviation of mammalian plasma pH down to 6.9 or above 7.7 from its normal range of 7.35 7.45 is therefore fatal to most mammalian organisms. Massive changes in the cellular redox and phosphorylation states also disorder cellular homeostasis. The pH of human plasma is normally maintained by the human body in the range from about 7.35 to 7.45 while the pH of human cellular cytoplasm is about 7.2 see Veech et al. in The major chemical system maintaining body pH within this narrow normal range is the CO₂ HCO₃ buffer system. The CO₂ of blood is maintained minute to minute by a portion of the mammalian brain called the respiratory center which senses brain cell pH and adjusts the depth and speed of respiration in response to changes in pH by increasing or decreasing CO₂ according to the famous Henderson Hasselbalch equation Henderson, L.J., Even though pH is thus seen to be a critical factor in mammalian blood, many commercial electrolyte solutions used The compositions and methods of the present invention overcome the above indicated prior art problems. These compositions and methods employ definite ratios of bicarbonate carbon dioxide , l lactate pyruvate , and d betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate . Each of these mixtures constitutes a near equilibrium couple which is known to be a normal constituent of mammalian plasma. While each of these pairs of components has been previously employed at least on a laboratory basis in solutions used for animal mammalian experiments, these mixture pairs have never previously been used in an electrolyte solution to obtain a normal Na Cl milliequivalent ratio or to solve the anion gap problem. All previous electrolyte solutions, and plasma substitutes, induce severe and measurable pathogenic abnormalities and no prior art electrolyte solution or plasma substitute has both a employed at least one of the three mixture pairs of this invention and b achieved a normal Na Cl milliequivalent ratio as taught herein. Thus, for example, the Krebs Henseleit solution contains the HCO₃ CO₂ buffer system but contains excessive chloride ions . Schimassek Schimassek, H. The making of a Krebs Henseleit electrolyte solution or other prior art electrolyte solution and the incorporation thereinto of a mixture of l lactate and pyruvate anions, or of a mixture of d betahydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate anions did not, and could not, result in the making of an electrolyte solution wherein the anion gap problem was overcome or wherein the milliequivalent ratio of sodium cations to chloride anions was normalized , in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, because each of such resulting solutions would still contain excessive chloride anions and so would inevitably cause hyperchloremia if and when used under In general summary, the prior art describes a series of electrolyte solutions typically of about 270 320 milliosmoles or higher comprised of a 1 to 4 metallic cations of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium in amounts greater than 0.5 mmol l, b 1 to 5 inorganic anions of chloride plus also H₂PO₄² HPO₄¹ the later also called Pi herein , sulphate SO₄² , c 0 to several organic carboxylic or bicarbonate anions, d 0 to about 12 nonionic materials in concentrations of greater than about 0.5 mmol l from the group comprising CO₂ gas, glucose, urea, glutamine, and others, and e sometimes one or more high molecular weight substances, such as albumin, hemocel, and the like. None of these solutions, for the reasons herein above explained, either normalizes the milliequivalent ratio of Na Cl at all, or normalizes this ratio without causing profound and adverse physiological consequences. In the present invention, there are provided processes and compositions of a complex fluid nature for This invention provides in one aspect an The invention also provides a fluid medium for living animal cells comprising on the basis of one liter of solution This invention provides electrolytes of the class indicated wherein physiologically normal concentrations of the divalent cations Mg² and Ca² may be included without precipitation. When used for contacting mammalian or avian cells or organs in accord with the present process teaching, such a solution generally In such One first class of such solutions characteristically utilizes contains an inorganic class of anions comprised of chloride and bicarbonate. These solutions have a physiological pH which is broadly in the range from about 5 to 9, preferably in the range from about 6.9 to 8.6, more preferably in the range from about 7.35 to 7.45, and most preferably about 7.4. When HCO₃ is present, dissolved carbon dioxide must be present in these solutions. CO₂ must also be present in the amounts specified so as to achieve the pH desired. When used, these solutions not only tend to maintain a normal Na Cl ratio in the surrounding fluid media, but also tend to set regulate the treated cell s internal e.g., intracellular fluid pH within normal limits of about 7.35 to 7.55. A second, preferred class of such solutions characteristically utilizes contains chloride anions and a class of carboxylate anionic couples comprised of at least one pair from the group consisting of a a mixture of l lactate anions and pyruvate anions, b a mixture of d betahydroxybutyrate anions and acetoacetate anions, and c a mixture of both a and b . These solutions have a physiological pH which is as above defined in connection with such first class of solutions. When administered, these solutions not only tend to maintain the treated cells redox state within a normal range, but also tend to maintain that cells phosphorylation potential within a normal range. A third, more preferred class of such solutions characteristically utilized contains both chloride anions, and bicarbonate carbon dioxide mixture, as in such first class of solutions, but also utilizes contains such class of carboxylate anionic couples, as in such second class of solutions. When administered, these solutions achieve the above indicated effects obtained from the use of such first class of solutions and the above indicated effects obtained from the use of such second class of solutions. The specified milliequivalent ratio of sodium to chloride in normal mammalian blood generally is believed to be in the range from about 1.28 1 to 1.45 1. Broader ranges of ratios centering around these ratios are employed in solutions used in the practice of this invention although marked deviations from the normal ranges may also be used to achieve special purposes. The total quantity, or sum sigma , of bicarbonate anions and carbon dioxide present in a solution of this invention ranges from 0 to 55 millimoles per liter of solution. The ratio of bicarbonate milliequivalents to dissolved carbon dioxide milliequivalents in a liter of a solution of this invention can range from about 6.3 1 to 55 1. Preferably, bicarbonate concentration ranges from about 20 mmol l to 50 mmol l and such ratio ranges from about 10 1 to 32 1, and more preferably such total ranges from about 23 mmol l to 35mmol l while such ratio ranges from about 19 1 to 21 1. A ratio of 19.95 1 for HCO₃ CO₂ gives a pH 7.4 which is presently particularly preferred. The total quantity, or sum sigma of l lactate anions and pyruvate anions present in a solution of this invention ranges from 0 mmol l to 55 millimoles per liter of solution. The ratio of l lactate anion milliequivalents per liter to pyruvate anion milliequivalents per liter in a solution of this invention can range from about 30 1 to 1 1. Preferably, such total quantity ranges from about 0.5 mmol l to 10 mmol l and such ratio ranges from about 3 1 to 15 1, and more preferably such total quantity ranges from about 2 mmol l to 8 mmol l while such ratio ranges from about 5 1 to 12 1. The total quantity, or sum sigma of d betahydroxybutyrate anions and acetoacetate anions present in a solutions of this invention ranges from about 0 mmol l to about 55 millimoles per liter of solution. The ratio of d betahydroxybutyrate anion milliequivalents per liter to acetoacetate anion milliequivalents per liter in a solution of this invention can range from about 6 1 to 0.5 1. Preferably, such total ranges from about 0.5 mmol l to 10 mmol l and such ratio ranges from about 4 1 to 1 1, and more preferably such total ranges from about 2 mmol l to 5 mmol l while such ratio ranges from about 3 1 to 1.5 1. By the term milliequivalent ratio as sometimes used herein, reference is made to the ratio of milliequivalents per liter of one substance to milliequivalents per liter of another substance in an aqueous medium. The bicarbonate carbon dioxide couple generally tends, to regulate the concentration of hydrogen ions in the bathing media and in treated cells, and each one of the near equilibrium couples employed in the practice of this invention generally tends to normalize the redox state of each of the three pyridine nucleotide couples. The phosphorylation potential also generally tends to be normalized. Also, each such near equilibrium couple when used as herein described constitutes a safe entry point into the metabolic system of a treated cell. By the term safe entry point as used herein reference is generally had to a metabolite which, in living tissue or cells Further, each such above described near equilibrium couples in this invention exhibits a distribution or permeability between intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid such that the ratio of the concentrations in, respectively, intracellular fluid to extracellular fluid ranges from about 1.0 1 to 1.5 1 in most all mammalian cells. Nonionics incorporated with the solutions of this invention preferably should each constitute a safe entry point. For example, glucose concentration is below 13 mmol l under normal physiological conditions in a healthy man. Use of glucose at concentrations above 13 mmol l as in the widely used 5 glucose solution is acceptable as a calorie Source, apart from considering the source of pathology, or the carboxylate couples, discussed herein. The extreme ability of the mammalian body to regulate metabolism of glucose makes glucose to be preferred over other possible nonionics, such as fructose or glycerol, which enter the metabolic system in an uncontrolled manner causing pathologic changes such as those already referenced, and so such non ionics are not safe entry points. In the special cases where tissue water may need to be removed, as in the case of cryo preservation of tissues, very high concentrations of osmotically active substances may be used. Characteristically, a solution used in the practice of this invention contains from about 130 to 170 millimoles per liter of sodium cations, and more preferably from about 129 to 163.5 mmol l and most preferably from about 136 to 155 mmol l. In addition, a solution contains sufficient chloride anions to produce a milliequivalent ratio of sodium cations to chloride anions in the range above defined. Optionally, in addition to sodium, a solution of this invention contains at least two of the following additional metallic cations each in a respective quantity as below indicated Optionally a solution of this invention can have additionally incorporated dissolved therein from 0 to about 6000 millimoles per liter of at least one substantially nonionic including zwitterionic osmotically active substance which is preferably metabolizable . A solution used in the practice of this invention is further characterized by generally having Examples of usable such nonionic substances include glucose, glycerol, fructose, sorbitol, urea and the like. Glucose is presently most preferred for nutrional purposes, and glycerol presently most preferred for cryopreservation purposes. Also optionally a solution of this invention may have incorporated in it from 0 to 55 meq liter of a polyanion incorporated in it, preferably in the Na form. As hereinbelow explained, the processes and the solutions of the present invention find use in a wide variety of Various additional objects, aims, purposes, features, advantages, application, variations, and the like will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings of the present specification taken with the claims. In biological cells, most reactants are catalyzed by enzymes of which an average cell may have of the order of 10⁴. In one classification, enzymes may be grouped in only six major functional categories Since co enzymes take part in multiple intracellular reaction within a given cellular compartment, the chemical portential of the co enzyme couple becomes of central imporatnce in energy transformation and oxido reductions occurring in living matter. The thermodynamic characteristics of a particular whole set of oxido reduction reactions is dependent upon the ratio of the free concentrations strictly speaking, the activities of the free NAD and free NADH ratio. The ratio NA P D NAD P H , thus represents and defines the redox state, at a given pH, of a particular pyridine nucleotide couple, and this ratio then determines The term redox state as thus used herein can be considered to refer to the oxidation reduction state of any one or more of the three main pyridine nucleotide couples. Each of these couples are The three pyridine nucleotide couples or pools each achieve different redox potentials because of the chemical energies of the substrates to which they are linked by their respective enzymes since the standard redox potential of NAD NADH is about 0.32 V. Thus, the near equilibrium NAD linked dehydrogenases have a Keq of about 10 ¹¹M, the mitochondrial NAD linked dehydrogenases have a Keq of about 10 ⁹M, and the cytoplasmic NADP linked dehydrogenases have a K The oxidation of l lactate anions to pyruvate anions that is, the lose of 2H and 2e from lactate is accompanied by the reduction of pyridine nucleotide NAD . That is, NAD gains two electrons and one H being liberated into the aqueous media where its activity is indicated and controlled by the HCO₃ CO₂ couple. In general, the term redox state may also be defined as a ratio of oxidized substrate reduced substrate . The half or mid point potential E In the case of a living cell, a plurality of oxidation reduction reactions occur simultaneously. Under normal conditions, these reactions occur in a normal healthy cell in a predictable manner. How these various redox states are regulated has just been described in thermodynamic terms. The normal healthy cell keeps the redox state of its free cytoplasmic NAD NADH redox couple at a ratio of about 500 to 1500 which corresponds to a voltage of about 0.2 volts. In this way, the cytoplasmic pyridine nucleotides can accept the H and e from the substrates or food presented into energy. When the cell is metabolizing very reduced substrates, such as fatty acids, the cytoplasmic NAD NADH is about 400 800. When the cell is metabolizing carbohydrates or amino acids, it is obvious that these compounds are already partially oxidized. Therefore, the free cytoplasmic NAD NADH reflects the oxidation level of its substrate and becomes more oxidized in the range of about 800 to 1500. The redox state of the free cytoplasmic NAD NADH NADH couple can be determined by various techniques, such as by measuring the ratio of l lactate pyruvate a in freeze clamped tissue, b in the venous effluent leaving the organ in question, or c in the medium bathing the tissue in question. Alternatively l malate oxaloacetate or α glyerophosphate dihydroxyacetone P ratios in tissue may be measured, if desired. The value of cytoplasmic NAD NADH can then be calculated. In healthy living mammals, the ratio of l lactate pyruvate is about 6, but can range, under special situations, such as starvation, to about 15 20. A l lactate pyruvate ratio below about 20, as occurs after ethanol consumption because of its links to the cytoplasmic NAD NADH , is pathologic. A characteristic in all cells having a low NAD NADH ratio is believed to be demonstrable observable pathologic consequences, such as tissue swelling, low phosphorylation potential, low plasma membrane voltage, and abnormal electrolyte distribution between intracellular and extracellular H₂O. Similarly, the redox state of the free mitochondrial NAD NADH can be determined by various techniques using tissues such as, for example, kidney or liver, by measuring the ratio of d beta hydroxybutyrate acetoacetate a in freeze clamped tissue, b in the venous effluent leaving such tissue, or c in the fluid bathing isolated such tissues. A determintion of the free mitochondrial NAD NADH in other tissues, such as brain or heart muscle, is more complex, but, in some cases, can be accomplished by measurement in freeze clamped tissue of the alpha keto glutarate NH₄ glutamate ratio see Miller A.L., Hawkins, R.A., and Veech, R.L. The normal ratio of mitochondrial NAD NADH is between about 5 and 20, and the normal ratio of beta hydroxybutyrate acetoacetate is about 1.3 to 5. The value of mitochondrial NAD NADH can then be calculated. The redox state of the free cytoplasmic NADP NADPH couple is, of course, affected by the CO₂ of surrounding fluids. Because of the lack of substrates which are permeant to the cell wall without significant and variable gradients, this redox state cannot at present be directly and totally regulated other than by the intracellular metabolic links with the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial NAD NADH . See Krebs H.A. and Veech, R.L. Pyridine Nucleotide Interrelations , 1969 in Pyruvate l lactate and CO₂ are permeable to cell wall in a simple fashion, as are d betahydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate , while malate² and other dicarboxylates are not. While the importance of redox state to the maintenance and normalization of intracellular metabolic porcesses and bioenergetics has long been recognized, there has never been previously so far as is now known any attempt to regulate or to normalize the redox state in cells being manipulated Exisiting electrolyte fluids make no attempt to maintain or normalize cellular redox potentials in any way whatsoever. In fact, most existing electrolyte fluids for Just as the NAD NADH ratio is defined as a redox state , by analogy, it is customary to define the energy state of the adenine nucleotide co enzyme couple as the phosphorylation state or the phosphorylation potential . Because in living cells ATP, ADP, and HPO₄ exist in several charged forms, and in various complexation states with Mg² , it is customary to define these forms as sigma ATP, sigma ADP, and sigma Pi. The phosphorylation potential is thus defined by the relationship sigma ATP sigma ADP sigma Pi . It is clear that the reaction of oxidative phosphorylation is influenced by both the redox state of mitochondria and the cytoplasmic phosphorylation potential. The phosphorylation potential cannot apparently be controlled directly by addition ATP or ADP to the media surrounding cells because cell walls are impermeable to these compounds. However, there is another reaction which is in near equilibrium with the cytoplasmic sigma ATP sigma ADP sigma Pi see Veech et al. in Metabolism in any living cell may be considered to be an ordered process whereby H and electrons e are removed from substrates and passed to co enzyme acceptors which are largely cytoplasmic NAD . This cofactor thus has a potential in the cell far more oxidized at about 0.19 volts than its standard potential of about 0.32 volts so that it may accept these electrons. The H and e gathered in the cytoplasm, or even created in the mitochondria, may then be transferred to mitochondria by mechanisms involving other substrates linked to mitochondrial NAD NADH , which has a lower potential of about 0.28 volts in most mammalian cells. If e and H are produced with a higher voltage, such as for example, from the oxidation of succinate or fatty acids, they reduce FAD to FADH which has a more oxidized potential and therefore less potential energy. H and electrons produced from NADH linked substrates produce 3 ATP for each 1 2 O₂ consumed while those from flavo protein FAD acceptors produce only 2. This difference in energy is due to the fundamental difference in the chemical reactions involved in producing the H and e . The fundamental process of cell respiration where NADH is oxidized to form heat and energy is called oxidative phosphorylation. It occurs in cellular organelles called mitochondria in a series of redox reactions called the electron transport chain. The mitochondrial electron transport system takes two electrons 2e from substrates and passed them up the chain to reduce 1 2 O₂ forming H₂O. The energy realized in this process is conserved in the cell in a chemical form of the anhydride bond in the terminal phosphate group of adenosine triphosphate ATP . The formation of three pyrophosphate bonds of ATP leads to the formation of H₂O and requires 3H in addition to the formation of the 1 H₂O formed from NADH plus H plus 2e taken from the substrates being oxidized by the cell. The reaction of oxidative phosphorylation is a spontaneous one see Veech et al. in cited reference . The phosphorylation potential of living cells can be measured by determining the cellular contents of the components of certain metabolites see Veech, R.L., in Since on theoretical grounds Veech et al. in J. Biol. Chem. 254, 6538 6547, 1979, showed that the creatine creatine P ratio is in near equilibrium with the cytoplasmic sigma ATP sigma ADP ratio, it follows that the phosphorylation potential in skeletal muscle or brain may be evaluated in living cells by measuring the sigma creatine P sigma Pi ratio without resorting to freeze clamping of the cells by the use of ³¹P NMR nuclear magnetic resonance as has been done by Chance and others see Chance, B. et al. Because the cytoplasmic sigma ATP sigma ADP sigma Pi or phosphorylation potential is related to the cytoplasmic NAD NADH or redox state by a near equilibrium reaction catalyzed by glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and 3 phosphoglycerate kinase, it is possible to alter and regulate and normalize the phosphorylation potential of a living cell by affecting its redox state as is believed to be accomplished in the present invention . If a simple, reliable chemical means were known and or could be devised to change the intracellular redox state, it would of necessity have to change the other components of the reaction which include the phosphorylation potential and would be of obvious fundamental importance in medicine and in many other related fields of biochemistry, physiology, molecular biology, tissue culture, veterinary medicine, and like endeavors. Such a chemical means is provided by the teachings of the present invention. As above indicated, a large portion of metabolism is devoted to energy generation which involves the removal of H and e from substrates in cytoplasm or mitochondria for delivery to mitochondrial electron transport scheme for conversion of 2H plus 2e with 1 2 O₂ to yield H₂O with the liberation of about 1 volt or 54 kcal mole 226 kJ mol of energy which is conserved in the sigma ATP sigma ADP sigma Pi couple. In mammalian and other cells, the sigma ATP sigma ADP sigma Pi has a delta G free energy of between 13.6 kcal mol 57 kJ mol and 14.1 kcal mol 59 kJ mol . The transfer of this H and e is accomplished by a series of co factors, the major one being NAD nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and its phosphate called NADP . Oxidation is defined as the removal of electrons, and reduction as the addition of electrons. The removal or addition of e plus H from substrates is catalyzed by enzymes, the major group of which are called dehydrogenases, as indicated above. The enzymes catalysts control the rates at which reactions occur, but the extent and the direction of a reaction, and the amount of energy delta G which may be liberated by a reaction, is determined by the inherent energy in the chemical bonds delta G and the concentrations of the reactants and products. Determination of any redox or energy state must always involve a ratio of chemical compounds, product reactant and oxidized co factor reduced co factor . The overall reaction is thus comprised of two individual redox systems, one of which is oxidized, while the other is reduced. Those enzymes within a cell which are of sufficiently high activity relative to the flux through the enzyme to catalyze a state of near equilibrium are suitable for controlling the redox state. A reaction may be experimentally determined to be in a state of near equilibrium by measuring the equilibrium constant K Various cytoplasmic and mitochondrial NAD linked dehydrogenases appear to be capable of controlling or setting the NAD NADH ratio in each of cytoplasm and mitochondrium. However, only the enzymes LDH l latate dehydrogenase or E.C. 1.1.1.27 , or d Betahyroxybutyrate dehydrogenase possesses permeant metabolites capable of directly and completely regulating intracellular redox states in most cells. For example, one member or the other of such a redox couple may not be capable of permeating or penetrating a cell wall without a severe gradient in concentration being present. In other instances, one or the other of the partners of a redox couple when given above as is currently practiced in the art would lead to demonstratable toxicity when administered to a cell. The near equilibrium redox active metabolite carboxylate couples employed in the practice of the present invention, specifically, l lactate pyruvate and d betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate , constitute safe entry points and appear to be unusual in their ability to not only normalize the redox state in cytoplasm through the reaction of l lactate and pyruvate with LDH, but also to regulate the redox state in the mitochondrial through reaction of and d betahydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate with the enzyme d beta hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase E.C. 1.1.1.30 which is apparently present in most tissues at a high enough activity to maintain near equilibrium conditions at most times. As indicated above see Table I and related text , previous attempts to normalize the sodium to chloride milliequivalent mole ratio of about 1.36 were usually done In the solutions of the present invention, one employs at least one near equilibrium couple mixture. In each couple mixture, the two member components are employed in a definite milliequivalent ratio relative to one another. Such a ratio is needed in order to control either the plasma pH, or the redox state and consequently the phosphorylation potential , or both. Among the possible mixture couples which could be used, the couples were selected because, for each couple When solution levels of, respectively, l lactate pyruvate, d betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate, and bicarbonate CO₂ in the bathing fluid are maintained within their normal limits, then the redox state, the phosphorylation state, and the pH of fluids and cells each tend to be normalized which is achieved as a result of the use of such solutions. Intracellular concentrations of each member of each couple is achieved through the extracellular fluid because each of the monovalent anions chosen, namely, l lactate and pyruvate, d betahydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate, and also bicarbonate, distribute themselves between extracellular water and intracellular water in concentration ratios or gradients which are the inverse of the hydrogen ion, thereby achieving a gradient or ratio of about 1.35 between extracellular and intracellular fluid. The nonionic dissolved CO₂ distributes itself substantially equally between extracellular fluid and intracellular fluid. Those learned in the art realize a redox state must be defined at a certain pH, or H ion concentration. The near equilibrium couple HCO₃ CO₂ defines the cellular pH or H concentration. This near equilibrium couple is therefore an integral part of the redox state. Preferably the level of sigma HCO₃ plus CO₂ present in any given solution of this invention may vary under normal physiological conditions from about 10 mmol l to 55 mmol l, but in general, is when present in the range from about 25 to 35 mmol l. The milliequivalent ratio of HCO₃ CO₂ , in effect, is defined so as to give a H ion concentration, or pH, in the physiological range as defined above. The redox and phosphorylation states in various tissues in the rat have been given by Veech et al. By the term plasma or blood plasma as used herein, conventional general reference is had to the liquid part of the blood as distinguished from the corpuscles. Plasma can be prepared by various techniques well known to those familiar with this art typically using centrifugal force to separate a supernatant which is plasma after non coagulated blood is centrifuged. By the term extracellular fluid as used herein conventional general reference is had to all body fluids in extracellular spaces outside of the circulatory system e.g. the blood and outside of intracellular fluid in a mammal typically constituting about 15 of the weight of a mammal . By the term intercellular fluid as used herein conventional general reference is had the fluid within cells which constitutes about 57 of total mammalian body weight. It is well known that see Black, Thus, in summary, the compositions of this invention tend to normalize a fluid pH, b composition of major fluid inorganic electrolytes, including the milliequivalent ratio of Na Cl and the anion gap , c the redox state, and d the phosphorylation potential. These normalizations are obtained and achieved without the abnormal, pathological consequences inherent in all known art solutions. No other man made solutions are presently known which will accomplish this combination of results. The electrolyte solutions of the present invention can be prepared by any convenient or conventional procedure. As a matter of accuracy, the compositions of this invention can be described in terms of their ion contents which can be expressed either in terms of millimoles per liter of solution, or milliequivalents per litre of solution. It is standard practice in this art in describing a given solution to separate anions from cations, and nonionics from ionic materials this practice is followed herein in the main. As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, a translation or conversion of millimoles per liter of solution, or of milliequivalents per liter of solution, into grams of a given salt added per liter of water is routine and is given in any standard text book in the field, such as, for example, The solutions of this invention, and the component materials incorporated thereinto, are, in general, formulated, so as to achieve the desired physiological Na Cl milliequivalent ratio normality, and the desired capacity to regulate, correct, and normalize the conditions and states above identified herein. Thus, by this practice of this invention, one can accomplish in a physiologically acceptable manner the removal of metabolic products from cellular water, the replacement of cellular fluids and electrolytes, and the administration of nutrients, and the like, and the growth of cells in culture. The solutions may be administered in any fashion desired so long as they contact living tissue, cells or aggregations of cells. Contacting can be accomplished by any convenient technique, such as, for example, by perfusion of whole organs, across a semi permeable membrane in cell suspensions, in tissue slices, in cells cultured either on plates, in roller bottles, in suspensions and the like, as those skilled in the art will readily appreciate. The solutions of this invention as prepared are, in general, well suited for the administration of therapeutic agents to cells in any form Those skilled in the art will realize that in any given solution of this invention one can incorporate an excess of one or more individual members of any one mixture couple of this invention so that a the ratio of one member to the other of any given couple and b the total quantity of both mixtures or members lies outside of the ranges hereinabove described. Such a single member excess is not recommended when practising the present invention. However, if such a single member excess does occur, the amount of the excess can be calculated by determining the maximum ratio of one couple member to the other which can be present in accord with the above teachings, and then the quantity of one couple member remaining or present which is outside of this ratio range may be considered to constitute an excess. The effect of such an excess is evidently merely to cut down, but not to eliminate, the efficacy of what effect would otherwise be obtained by using only a solution which contains mole ratios and quantities of respective mixture couples within the spirit and scope teachings of this invention. In the making of solutions of this invention, it is preferred to employ the optically active l lactate salts or l lactic acid which will make the desired l lactate anions in solution , and also similarly to employ d betahydroxybutyric acid or d betahydroxybutyrate salts will make the desired d betahydroxybutyrate anions in solution . Choice of particular salt or acid or mixture used in any given case depends among various factors, such as upon the other starting inorganic salts which a formulator desires to use based upon availability, cost, and like factors , all as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. Racemic d,l mixtures could be used, but their use is preferably avoided. If such are used, the ratios of one member to another in the respective near equilibrium couples involved should be based upon the quantity of particular optically active form present e.g. either l lactate or d betahydroxybutyrate , as the case may be . The carbon dioxide, when used, can be introduced either as a gas, preferably using conventional aeration apparatus to effect a solubilization of CO₂ in a solution, or it can be generated As elsewhere indicated herein, if desired, a solution of this invention can also contain various known additives such as, for example, as Basal Eagle s Media for use in tissue culture. For a listing of the small and varied components usually added to the Balanced Salt Solution of tissue culture media described here see Eage, H. In general, a solution of this invention should contain as a minimum of total of sigma lactate pyruvate and or sigma betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate and or sigma bicarbonate carbon dioxide which is at least about 0.1 millimoles per liter as indicated. Below these levels, benefits in normalization of body metabolism as explained above are apparently achievable, but such benefits become increasingly difficult to demonstrate and prove by state of the art techniques of measurement. Consequently, it is preferred to avoid, if possible, homeopathic possibilities by using minimum concentrations as above indicated. When bicarbonate is present, the total quantity of sigma lactate pyruvate and or betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate used can generally be reduced which is now believed to be desirable. Thus, when bicarbonate is present, the total sigma l lactate pyruvate and or d betahydroxybutyrate acetoacetate is preferably about 2 to 17 millimoles per liter. When a solution of this invention contains at least one metabolizable nonionic or zwitterionic osmotically active substance, added to provide nutritional requirements no account of the proper Na Cl ratio need be considered as for instance after addition of glucose and glutamine. When for examples, compounds like Na glutamate or lysine Cl is added in a nutritive mixture, amounts over 1 meq l can be compensated for by adjusting the Na and Cl within the basic balanced salt mixture. In summary, the present invention relates to an the relationship between said water and all solutes in said water being such that said solution is characterized by having In summary compositions of this invention can be described by the following Table IV the relationship between said water and said components being such that In practice, the compositional limits of electrolytes used in a balanced salt solutions for tissue culture, b perfusion media for perfusion of organs, or c incubation media for tissue slices, minces, homogenates, or isolated cells and the like, are much smaller that the corresponding limits used in Also in practice, perfusion media may contain bovine serum albumin as known in the art see Table II above . If a non binding polyanion is used, no compensation is needed for example, when carboxymethyl starch is substituted for albumin . In tissue culture it is not customary to add polyvalent anions in concentrations which require use of increased cation levels since fetal calf serum is added typically as a 10 solution . Thus, in the main, the solutions of this invention are intended to provide an improved electrolytes composition with a normal Na Cl ratio, a physiologic pH, and a regulation of redox state and phosphorylation state if desired. To such a solution one may add any combination of nutrients, macromolecules, or the like so long as the sodium and chloride on such additives are compensated for so as to maintain such concentrations at those herein described. Osmotically active substances including zwitterions may be used as desired. It is clear that, basically, as Table III shows, the existing balanced salt mixtures are either Krebs Henseleit with altered Ca² Mg² see Ex. 10, 22, 23, 24, and 25 of Table III or Krebs Ringers phosphate see Ex. 26 and 11 of Table III . It is further clear from Table V that examples A E differ radically from prior art balanced salt solutions. They also differ from all prior art perfusion media see Table II, Ex. 15 19 which have an abnormal Na Cl ratio with the exception of solution 20, Table II which normalized the Na Cl with acetate with the now known toxic consequences since acetate does not constitute a safe entry point. The way that the albumin was used in the prior art did not correct the abnormal Na Cl ratio in the prior art solutions. In the prior art, albumin was used to get improvied flow through capillaries improved viscosity during perfusion and reduced sticking together of cells during incubation. These prior art benefits may be utilized in the present invention if albumin is added to a balanced salt solution of the present invention. New results are obtained, not known to or achieved in, the prior art because, for one thing, the present solutions offer the ability to maintain a normal Na Cl ratio and a normal anion gap. The present invention is further illustrated by reference to the following examples. The compositions here described in Table V are balanced salt solutions of the present invention prepared as taught by Dawson et al., reference cited. Table VI Examples F I illustrates the compositional differences which exist for compositions according to the invention which contain polyanions. Fibroblasts are grown in tissue culture balanced salt solutions of two types to which is added Eagles Basal Media to both salt mixtures. References Cells are grown in roller bottles in the conventional manner, one in 5 CO₂ the other in 6 CO₂ with media changed every two days. It is noted that the firbroblasts reach confluence in 7 days using salts from example C, but take 10 days to reach confluence using salts from example 22. It is concluded that the new salt mixture facilitates growth of cultured cells. On day six of the culturing procedure, 1 hour after the media was changed, the cells were killed by addition of perchloric acid and then metabolite contents were measured as described in Veech et al It is noted that the phosphorylation potential is significantly elevated in the cells grown in Earle s salts and normal for fibroblasts grown in the salt solution of the present invention. Another set of cells is exposed to glutaraldehyde and fixed for electron microscopy. It is noted that fibroblasts grown in earle s salts have disordered or abnormal intracellular structure whereas those grown in the salt solution of the present invention appear like normal fibroblasts. It is noted that the phosphorylation state of cells incubated in Krebs Henseleit is abnormally elevated whereas that of cells incubated in so called Krebs Albuminate solution of the present invention with a normal Na Cl ratio have a normal phosphorylation state. Hepatocytes are made and incubated as described by Crow, K.E., Cornell, N.W. Veech, R.L. One set is incubated in Krebs Henseleit solution to which is added 5 mmoles l a sum of Na lactate and Na pyruvate in a 7 1 ratio solution 10, Table III and another set of cells is incubated with lactate pyruvate as described in Krebs Albuminate solution of the present invention example G Table VI . After 1 hour incubation the cells are centrifuged into perchloric acid under bromododecane and their metabolite contents measured. We note that the phosphorylation potential in cells incubated in Krebs Henseleit with a Na Cl rates of 1 12 is greater than the phosphorylation potential in hepatocytes incubated in Krebs Albuminate where the Na Cl ratio is 1 34. This shows that the NaCl ratio in the external media surrounding the cells can influence the central internal energy status of the cell. It further shows that the system behaves like a near equilibrium one. It will be appreciated that many variations and further embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing teachings.
