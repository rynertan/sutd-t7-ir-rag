# Thin film solar cell with free tin on transparent conductor.

## Abstract
A thin film solar cell structure having a free metal layer between a transparent conductor front face contact and the front face surface of the actual thin film photovoltaic device. The free metal, preferably tin, may be formed by glow dis charge reduction of the transparent conductor surface or by direct deposition of free metal.
