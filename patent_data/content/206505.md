# An overcurrent protective circuit for modulated conductivity type MOSFET.

## Abstract
An overcurrent protective circuit for a BIFET 1 which has a voltage direction circuit 12, 13 for detecting a voltage between the drain and source of the BIFET 1 and a main switching circuit 14 for lowering a voltage between the gate and source of the BIFET 1 and preventing the failure or delay of turn on of the BIFET 1 according to the output of the voltage detection circuit 12, 13 . There is a constant time delay before an instant at which the main switching circuit becomes turned on during the initial turn on period of the BIFET 1 upon reception of the ON gate signal. Such a situation can be prevented that during the initial turn period of the BIFET 1 , the overcurrent protective circuit oper ates so as to cause the BIFET not to be turned on, or to be turned on after some delay.
