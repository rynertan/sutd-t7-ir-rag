## Description
TITLE Quinoxalinyloxy Ethers as Selective Weed Control AgentsTechnical Field This invention relates to quinoxalinyloxy ethers which are useful as selective weed control agents.The compounds are especially useful for controlling grass weeds in broadleaf crops such as soybeans. The presence ofndesirable vegetation causes substantial damage to useful crops, especially agricultural products that satisfy man s basic food and fiber needs, such as cotton, soybeans, bean and the like. The current population explosion and concomitant world food and fiber shortage underlie the need for improvements in the efficiency of producing these crops. Preventing or minimizing the loss of a portion of such valuable crops by killing or inhibiting the growth of undesired vegetation is one way of improving this efficiency. A wide variety of materials useful for killing or inhibiting controlling the growth of undesired vegetation is available such materials are commonly referred to as herbicides.

Formulations Useful formulations of the compounds of FormulaI can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid diluent s. More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions TABLE XXV Weight Percent Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a Surfactant or a Diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed.,Interscience, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at OOC. McCutcheon s Detergents andEmulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood,New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co.,Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning, Agglomeration , Chemical Enineering, December 4, 1967, pp. 147ff. and erry s Chemical Engineer s Handbook , 5th Ed., McGraw Hill, New York, 1973, pp. 8 57ff.

Use The test results to follow suggest that the compounds of the present invention are useful when applied as pre and or post emergence treatments for broad spectrum control of a wide variety of weed species growing on industrial sites, storage lots, along fences and building foundations, along railroad and utility rights .of way, etc. In addition, it appears that the compounds of this invention should have utility for weed control in certain crops, such as soybeans, cotton, sugarbeets and beans. The tested compounds have been shown to be particularly useful for selectively removing and controlling grass weeds, including volunteer corn, in broadleaf crops including soybeans, cotton, sugarbeets, beans, flax, cabbage, tomatoes, potatoes, peanuts, carrots, cucurbits, endive, beets, etc. Grassweeds include crabgrass Digitaria sp. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli , wild oats Avena fatua , etc. Some of the compounds also may control certain broadleaved weeds, and some are tolerant to certain grass crops such as rice and wheat.Tests indicate that the compounds of this invention generally show a remarkable and unexpected degree of safety to broadleaf crops and an unusual phytotoxicity to grass weeds whether applied to the soil before weeds and crops emerge, that is, pre emergence or whether applied post emergence including spraying on the weeds and crdps. In addition, the compounds are useful when applied as pre emergence or post emergence treatments alone or in combination with other herbicides or surfactants for broad spectrum control of a wide variety of weed species growing on industrial sites, on storage lots and along fences, building foundations, railroad, highway and utility rights of way, etc. The precise amount of the compounds of this invention to be used in any particular situation will vary according to the end result desired. Factors affecting the optimum rate of application include the particular compound to be used, the plant species to be controlled, soil type, formulation used, prevailing weather conditions, foliage density, length of time for which residual activity is desired, etc. Broadly speaking, the compounds are used at levels of about 0.005 to 20 kilograms per hectare, with the preferred range being about 0.02 to 10 kilograms per hectare. Not all of the compounds of this invention will be active at the lower levels of the stated application rate ranges. In general, the higher rates of application from within this range will be selected for adverse conditions or where extended persistence in soil is desired, and the lower rates for weed control in crops. The herbicides effectively control grass weeds as demonstrated by the examples, but they generally do not control broadleaf weeds at low application rates. To obtain control of a wider spectrum of both broadleaf and grass weeds, combination treatments consisting of compounds of this invention with other herbicides effective on broadleaf weeds may be used to advantage. Combination treatments may be used with the components applied simultaneously as in a tank mix or mixed formulation, or sequentially with either or both components applied preplant incorporated, pre emergence, post emergence, post emergencedirected, broadcast, band or spot treatment or any combination of these methods.The following examples of canbination utility are cited Compounds of this invention with Other Herbicide Use bentazon post Soybeans 2,4 DB post Peanuts, Soybeans Alfalfa, CloverSimazin pre Nursery, Citrus Peaches, Established Alfalfa Other Herbicides Use pyrazon pre , early post Sugarbeets silvex Fence lines, rights of ways dichloroprop post Brush, Release of EvergreensMCPB early post 2 peas dicamba pre flax and rape desmedipham post Sugarbeets prometryn pre Celery and CottonPhenmedipham post Sugarbeets acifluorfen Blazer Post Soybeans 2 chloro N 4 methoxy 6 methyl 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl aminocarbonyl benzene sulfonamide flax l methylethyl 2 4, 6 di methoxy 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl aminocarbonyl aminosulfonyl benzoate flax l methylethyl 2 4 methoxy 6 methyl 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl .aminocarbonyl aminosulfonyl benzoate flax dinoseb post Soybeans lenacil pre Sugarbeets bromoxynil post Wheat and barley fluometuron pre Cotton 1 2 4,6 dimethoxypyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonyl aminosul fonyl benzoyl pyrrolisine Soybeans 2 propenyl 2 t 4,6 dimethoxy pyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonyl aminosulfonyl benzoate Soybeans pyrazolate Rice naproanilide Rice Compound µ Compound 1 Methyl 2 14 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxy propanoate, m.p. 108 1110 2 Methyl 2 4 2 quinoxalinyloxy phenoxy propanoate, m.p. 110 115 3 Methyl 2 4 6 chloro 2 quinoxalinyloxy phenoxy propanoate, N oxide, m.p. 137 142 4 Methyl 2 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxy 2 methylpropanoate, m.p. 83 870 5 Methyl 4 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxylpentanoate, oil 6 Methyl 2 t4 6 or 7 trifluoromethyl 2 quinoxalinyloxy phenoxy propanoate, oil 7 Sodium 2 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxy propanoate 8 Methyl 2 4 6,7 dichloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxy propanoate, m.p. 100 105 9 Allyl 2 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxy propanoate, m.p. 64 690 10 2 4 2 quinoxalinyloxy phenoxy pro panoic acid, m.p. 137 141 11 Ethyl 2 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxy3propanoate, m.p. 65 750 12 Butyl 2 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxy propanoate, m.p. 64 720 13 Methyl 4 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxy pent 2 enoate, oil 14 Methyl 2 4 3 methyl 2 quinoxalinyloxy phenoxy3propanoate, m.p. 83.5 880 15 Methyl 2 4 7 bromo 2 quinoxalinyloxy phenoxy propanoate, m.p. 93 95 16 2 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalinyloxy phenoxy propanoic acid, m.p. 104 1070 17 Methyl 2 4 6 or 7 fluoro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxy propanoate, m.p. 113.1160 Compound t Compound 18 Methyl 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxylacetate, m.p. 94 98 19 Methyl 2 t4 6 or 7 methyl 2 quinoxa linyloxy phenoxylpropanoate, m.p. 103 111 20 Methyl 2 4 6,8 dichloro 2 or 3 quinoxa linyloxy phenoxy propanoate, m.p. 100 110 21 Benzyl 2 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quinoxalin yloxy phenoxy propanoate, m.p. 77 830 22 S cyclohexyl 2 4 6 or 7 chloro 2 quin oxalinyloxy phenoxy propanethioate, oil 23 .
