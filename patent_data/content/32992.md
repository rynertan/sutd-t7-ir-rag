# Circuit for interfacing a half duplex digital data line with a simplex transmitting and a simplex receiving line, and vice versa.

## Abstract
The present circuit, which serves as a twin simplex half duplex interfacing, includes a triple input NAND gate 28 , the output of which is connected directly to the outgoing simplex conductor 30 . Signals on the incoming simplex conductor 34 are applied to the three inputs of NAND gate 28 through separate signals paths which introduce different delays. One signal path introduces an intermediate delay before applying the incoming signal to NAND gate 28 in an inverted form. The half duplex line 16 is connected to this signal path. While incoming signals are applied at all three inputs to NAND gate 28 as well as to the half duplex line 16 , a lack of coincidence at the inputs prevents any incoming signal from passing through the circuit to the outgoing simplex line 30 .
