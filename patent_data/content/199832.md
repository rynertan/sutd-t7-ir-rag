# Variable speed transmission.

## Abstract
A variable speed transmission 20 includes a sprocket 46 mounted on a first shaft 22 for rotation therewith. A variable effective diameter pulley 30 is mounted for rotation on a driven shaft 32 . The pulley includes a pair of pulley halves 80, 82 having opposed inclined belt engaging surfaces 84, 86 and splines 90, 94 extending from the pulley halves. The splines are intermeshed so that the pulley halves may be drawn together or separated while rotating as a unit. A split shaft 130 , including two half shafts 132, 134 , extend within the pulley halves. Each half shaft engages one of the pulley halves such that as the half shafts are moved relative to one another, the pulley halves are moved one relative to the other. A pulley control mechanism 66 is provided for moving the halves of the split shaft simul taneously such that the center line of the pulley remains fixed as the pulley halves move together or apart. An endless chain assembly 60 is mounted around the gear and variable effective diameter pulley arrangement to transmit rotation therebetween. The belt includes edge portions 234 for engaging the pulley and an intermediate portion 230 for engaging the sprocket 46 . An idler pulley 50 is controlled by an idler tensioner actuation mechanism 52 to maintain tension on the belt as the effective diameter of the pulley is varied.
