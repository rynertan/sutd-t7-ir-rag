# An automatic focus control device.

## Abstract
An automatic focus control device used in an exposure apparatus comprises, a first light emitting device 3A for emitting a first light ray to a sample 2 a second light emitting device 3B for emitting a second light ray to the sample a first light detecting device for detecting the second light ray reflected by a surface of the sample, the first light detecting device having a plurality of light detecting ele ments 5a, 5b a second light detecting device for detecting the first light ray reflected by the surface of the sample, the second light detecting device having a plurality of light detecting elements 5c, 5d and a device for discriminating between an inclination of the sample and a variation of focus on the surface of the sample on the basis of an output of the first and second light detecting devices wherein the first light emitting device and the first light detecting device are located at a position symmetric to the second light emitting device and the second light detecting device with regard to a center axis of a light beam for exposing the sample.
