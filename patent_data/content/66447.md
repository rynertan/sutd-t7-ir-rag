# Reaction of a phenol, aldehyde and amine to produce hardening agent for epoxy resins.

## Abstract
A reaction product is obtained by reacting together a phenol and a polyamine at a temperature of 70 to 100 C, adding to the mixture 1.1 to 2 moles formaldehyde or a precursor thereof per mole of the phenol, allowing reaction at 70 to 100 C with stirring, and heating to 100 to 180 C to substantially remove the water formed. Optionally 0.1 to 1.5 moles of acrylonitrile are then added in this case the ratio of amine to phenol can be 1 2.5 1 otherwise the ratio must be 2 2.5 1. Exemplified phenols include phenol, cresol, and alkyl, aryl and aralkyl phenols the polyamine can be an alkylene, aralkylene or alicyclic polyamine. The product contains not more than 5 of unreacted phenol and not more than 35 of unreacted amine and so is not harmful to the skin of a user. It is easily used as hardening agent for a epoxy resin, e.g. of the bisphenol, novolak or cyclohexene oxide types, with good hardening properties.

## Description
Reaction of a phenol, aldehyde and amine to produce hardening agent for epoxy resinsThe present invention relates to a process of producing a hardening agent for epoxy resins. More particularly, this invention relates to a process of producing a hardening agent for epoxy resins which is a low viscosity product having an ureacted phenol content of 5 or less obtained by reacting a phenol, formaldehyde and an amine.Several reaction products obtained by reacting a phenol, an aldehyde and an aliphatic polyamine are known and are widely used in many industrial fields as hardening agents for epoxy resins at from low temperature to ordinary temperature or as hardening agents on wet surfaces. However, when such hardening agents contain more than 5 of unreacted phenols, they can be harmful to the users furthermore, epoxy resin hardening agents with a high content of unreacted amines are very likely to cause a rash on the skin of workers who handle them.In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for low viscosity epoxy resin hardening agents that are products of the reaction of phenol, aldehyde and amine and which have a low content of unreacted phenol. There is also a great demand for such hardening agents which also have a low content of unreacted amine. However, it is difficult to product a reaction product that meets all of these requirements, i.e. low contents of unreacted phenols and amines, and low viscosity.A reaction product of phenol, aldehyde and amine is conventionally produced by one of the following four methods 1 a phenol is first reacted with aldehyde, and then amine is added to the resulting product 2 amine is first reacted with aldehyde, and them phenol added to the resulting product 3 phenol and amine are mixed, and aldehyde is added to the mixture to cause the three components to react with each other and 4 phenol, aldehyde and amine are simultaneously reacted with each other. The third method is recommended for industrial use, and every prior publication relating thereto specifies that aldehyde be added to the mixture of phenol and amine at a temperature not higher than 400C.If the amount of aldehyde to be added is not great, it is possible to produce a hardening agent at a temperature not more than 40 C, but if the amount of aldehyde to be added is increased, the reaction between aldehyde and amine will produce an increased amount of a white product which is insoluble in the reaction mixture, thereby making it difficult to further agitate or blend the mixture. If the amount of aldehyde added is small, the resulting reaction product contains more of the unreacted phenol and amine, and so such product does not have the properties desired for an epoxy resin hardening agent.A reaction product with low content of unreacted phenol could be obtained without such disadvantage by the first method wherein phenol is reacted with aldehyde before addition of amine. However, this method unavoidably produces a highly viscous reaction product, and the viscosity further increases if more aldehyde is used. It is therefore difficult to use such a reaction product without using a large amount of a diluting agent however, the use of a large amount of diluting agent results in a hardening agent that cannot harden an epoxy resin without adversely affecting the physical properties and chemical resistance of the resin.In the second method wherein amine is first reacted with aldehyde before addition of phenol, use of a large amount of the aldehyde gives a viscous reaction mixture which is very difficult to stir in practice. To reduce the amount of unreacted phenol in the reaction product, a relatively large amount of aldehyde must be used, whereby the viscosity of the reaction product increases and, at the same time, white product tends to be formed in a large amount due to the reaction between aldehydes and amines. For such reasons, the second method is also not suitable for making the hardening agent.In either of the above conventional methods, the viscosity of the reaction product can be effectively decreased by adding more amine, but if the resulting product, i.e.hardening agent, contains a large amount of unreacted amine, it is highly likely to cause a rash on the skin of the workers who handle it. In addition, the epoxy resin being hardened by the resulting product absorbs carbon dioxide in air and turns white, which damages the appearance of the hardened resin. In particular, when the hardening agent is applied to multiple coated layers, the absorption of carbon dioxide may cause undesirable separation of the layers.We have found that a reaction product suitable as a hardening agent for epoxy resins having a low viscosity and a reduced content of the unreacted residual phenol can be produced by simultaneously reacting phenol, formaldehyde and amine in specified proportions and under specified reaction conditions, and also found that by further reacting the above reaction product with acrylonitrile, a reaction product having a low content of unreacted amine can be produced.The present invention provides a process for producing a hardening agent for epoxy resins having a low viscosity and a low content of unreacted phenol and amine, comprising mixing at least one phenol with at least one polyamine, adding 1.1 to 2 mols formaldehyde per mol of phenol to the mixture while it is at a temperature between 70 and 100 C, stirring the resulting mixture at a temperature between 70 and 1000C to react the three components with each other, heating the reaction mixture to between 100 and 18006 to remove the water produced during the reaction, and optionally reacting acrylonitrile with the resulting reaction product.In the known method 3 , the molar amount of amine does not exceed that of phenol and the amount of aldehyde does not exceed that of phenol.The characteristic feature of this invention is that the reactants are reacted in specified proportions and temperature. It is surprising that the invention provides a reaction product with an extremely low viscosity although it uses a large amount of formaldehyde.If formaldehyde is used in an amount less than 1.1 mole per mole of the phenol, the amount of unreacted phenol remaining in the hardening agent increases, and if formaldehyde is used in an amount more than 2 moles, a highly viscous product is formed.In the embodiment where the reaction product obtained by reacting the phenol, amine and formaldehyde is modified by reaction with acrylonitrile, the amount of the amine used can vary over a wider range, down to 1 mole. If no such modification is effected, the amine is used in an amount of from 2.0 to 2.5 moles per mole of the phenol. If the amine is used in an amount less than 1 mole per mole of the phenol, the viscosity of the hardening agent increases, and if the amount of amine is more than 2.5 moles, the amount of unreacted amine in the hardening agent increases.The greater the amount of the amine used, the smaller the amount of the unreacted phenol in the hardening agent, and hence the lower its viscosity. However, if the amine is used in excess of 2.5 moles, it absorbs carbon dioxide from the air and an epoxy resin hardened by the resulting hardening agent turns white, which damages the good appearance of the resin. Further, if the hardening agent is applied to multiple coated layers, the excessive amine may cause undesirable separation of the layers.The formaldehyde is added to the mixture of phenol and amine at a temperature of from 70 to 1000C. If the reaction temperature is below 700C, the white substance produced by the reaction between amines and formaldehyde dissolves so slowly that the reaction mixture cannot be stirred thoroughly.There is no particular limitation on the period over which formaldehyde is added to the mixture of the phenol and amine, but a too prolonged addition is not practical. If desired, a tertiary amine may be added to the reaction system as a catalyst.Examples of phenols which can be used in the process of the present invention include phenol ortho , meta or paracresol alkyl phenols such as n or iso butyl phenol, octyl phenol, nonyl phenol and xylenol aryl phenols such as phenyl phenol, tolyl phenol and xylyl phenol and aralkyl phenols such as benzyl phenol and styrenated phenol. These phenols may be used alone or in a mixture thereof. If desired, polyfunctional phenolic compounds such as 4,4 dihydroxydiphenylmethane and 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane may be used.The formaldehyde is usually employed in the form of an aqueous solution thereof. If desired, para formaldehyde, trioxane and other compounds that produce formaldehyde may be used.Examples of amines are polyamines such as linear aliphatic polyamines such as ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine, tetramethylenediamine and hexamethylenediamine aromatic ring containing aliphatic polyamines such as metaxylylenediamine and para xylylenediamine, and alicyclic polyamines such as 1,3 or 1,4 bis aminomethyl cyclohexane and N aminoethylpiperazine. These amines may be used alone or in a mixture thereof.If acrylonitrile is used, it is added to the reaction product after substantially removing the water produced during the reaction, in an amount of from 0.2 to 1.5 moles per mole of the phenol. There is no particular limitation on the temperature for this reaction between acrylonitrile and the reaction product, and any temperature not exceeding 1000C may be used. The addition of acrylonitrile is effective not only for reducing the amount of free amine but also for extending the pot life of curable epoxy resin compositions, whereby the operability of the hardening agent can be markedly improved. These advantages are not obtained if less than 0.2 mole of acrylonitrile is added.If acrylonitrile is used in an amount more than 1.5 moles, it takes much time to harden the epoxy resin, and in addition, the hardened product does not have satisfactorily high waterproofness and moisture resistance.The reaction product obtained by the method of the present invention contains not more than 5 of the unreacted phenol and not more than 3596 of the unreacted amine, and has an amine value usually in the range of from 350 to 650 mg KOH g and a viscosity of not more than 8000 cps at 25 0C, but usually at least 2000 cps. The reaction product is therefore very suitable for use as a hardening agent for epoxy resins. Any known epoxy resins can be hardened by the reaction product obtained by the process of the present invention, such as conventional bisphenol type epoxy resins, novolak type epoxy resins and cyclohexene oxide type epoxy resins.If solid epoxy resins are used, they are preferably dissolved in a suitable known solvent before they are hardened. The amount of the hardening agent used can be determined by calculating the active hydrogen equivalent with respect to the epoxy equivalent. In determining the amount of hardening agent, other factors such as the characteristics required for the hardened epoxy resin should also be considered.When the hardening agent produced by the process of this invention is incorporated into an epoxy resin, other additives which are conventionally used in epoxy resins can also be added, for example, diluents e.g. benzyl alcohol, dixylylmethane or dixylylethane , low viscosity xylene formaldehyde resins e.g. Nikanol LL of Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company,Inc, number average molecular weight of 350 to 380 , monoepoxy compounds e.g. butylglycidyl ether, phenylglycidyl ether andCardular E of Yuka Shell Epoxy Co., Ltd., which is a glycidyl ester of a C12 14 aliphatic monocarboxylic acid and has an epoxy equivalent of 240 to 250 , pigments and fillers.The epoxy resin into which the hardening agent of the present invention is incorporated can be hardened even at temperatures as low as 0 to 5 C or on wet surfaces. The hardened product has satisfactory surface gloss and smoothness, and is excellent in other properties such as resistance to chemicals, moisture and corrosion, and has very strong bonding properties.For these reasons, the hardening agent produced by the process of the present invention can be used for a wide variety of uses.The present invention is described hereinafter in greater detail by reference to the following examples and comparative examples, wherein percentages are by weight.
