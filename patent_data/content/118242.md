# Computer apparatus and remote keyboards therefor.

## Abstract
Computer apparatus comprising a central computer 13 having a data input port 12 , means 5,6,7,8,9 connecting two or more remote chord keyboards 1,2,3,4 to the input port, means 10 for identifying with each respective keyboard alpha numeric and like character data and com mand instructions generated by operation thereof and received through the input port the central computer being programmed to process and combine the character data from the keyboards in accordance with the commands and to output resultant information for display in common by video and or audio display means 14 in a preferred embodiment the key switches U,S,O,E, SPACE and CONTROL are connected in an R 2R resistive ladder network so that operation thereof either singly or in combinations of two to all will produce ratiometric changes in an analog output voltage VI P that uniquely varies as the binary weighting of the operated switch or switches combination, an analog to digital converter 10 being connected to the input port of the computer.
