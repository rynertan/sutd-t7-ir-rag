# Asymmetric current distributor.

## Abstract
An asymmetric woven wire mesh current distributor 5 for an electrode 2 contains more conductive elements or portions 8 in one direction than 9 in the other direction when installed in use in an electrode so that the greater number of wires 8 is perpendicular to the major current feeder bars and span the narrow part conductive path of the rectangular air cathode 2 . Preferably, the current distributor is a woven wire mesh wherein the ratio between the number of the perpendicular wires 8 to the parallel wires 9 ranges from about 1.5 to 3 1.
