# Metal spray device.

## Abstract
A metal spray gun of the arc spray type has a nozzle positioner member 50 of electrically insulating material that is disposed between a gas inlet 38 and an arc zone 120 . A primary stream of gas is flowed through a through passage in the nozzle positioner member, and seat surfaces 72 in the through passage receive tips 70 of individual electrically con ductive contact tube assemblies 66 that are biased outwardly away from one another. The nozzle positioner member 50 aligns the contact tube assemblies 66 and configures the gas stream such that each metal wire 14 is immediately en veloped in gas flow as it emerges from its contact tube and re mains in that enveloping gas flow throughout the region be tween the contact tube tip 70 and the arc zone 120 . The spray gun produces quality metal spray coatings with lower gas pressures and has lower noise levels.
