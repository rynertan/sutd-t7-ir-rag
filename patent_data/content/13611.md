# Electrochemical sensing apparatus.

## Abstract
A disposable gas sensor, such as for monitoring pOâ‚‚ in blood or administered gases, includes a housing 101 , a pas sageway 102 therein for blood or gas, a membrane anode cathode polarographic assembly 105, 106, 107 , and a temp erature sensing element 119, 121 . The temperature sensing element penetrates the housing and includes a removable thermistor 121 , which is matable with the housing for ther mal contact with a metallic element 119 , and which in turn is in direct contact with the fluid being monitored.
