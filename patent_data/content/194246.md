# A regulator means for use in heat pipes.

## Abstract
A radiator pipe comprising means for regulating the transfer of steam heat. The radiator pipe comprises a con denser part 3 , an evaporator part 1 and an interconnecting conduit 4 extending between and joining together said two parts. The regulator means comprises a valve having a valve seat 6 which is fixedly secured to the radiator pipe and a valve body 5 of a material having a different coefficient of thermal expansion than the material of the radiator pipe. One part 7 of the valve body 5 is fixedly connected to the radiat or pipe. Another part 8 of the valve body 5 cooperates with the valve seat 6 and together with said valve seat it delimits an opening gap in said valve the size of which varies in de pendence of the degree of heating of the radiator pipe.
