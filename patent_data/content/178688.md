# Refractory binder and method for making it.

## Abstract
A refractory binder comprises a suspension of colloidal particles the oxide of which will not act as a fluxing agent to alumina silica fibers at temperatures above 815.5 C, and a tackifying agent in intiminate admixture with the said suspension. This binder is made by reacting a colioidal suspension of particles selected among the group consisting of alumina, silica or zirconia with a tackifying agent. The binder may be applied to a refractory material comprising a plurality of refractory fibers.
