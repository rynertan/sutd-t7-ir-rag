# Method and electrolytic display for selectively displaying an image.

## Abstract
An image is displayed in an electrolytic display cell 10 by the reversible deposition ou electrodes having non scattering surfaces of a deposit having light scattering properties. The deposit scatters incident light out of the specular direction and the image is formed from one only of the specular and non specular components of the emergent light. The cell 10 is illuminated by a lamp 50 through an infra red mirror 51 and aspheric lens 52 . The lamp is backed by a reflector 53 . The illumination system produces a partly collimated converging beam of light with relatively limited angular divergence which strikes the cell 10 obli quely at an angle of about 45 degrees. Specularly reflected rays are reflected towards a retro reflector 54 which returns this light in the general direction of the cell. A proportion of scattered light from the written electrodes is collected by a projection lens assembly 55 and projected onto a screen.
