## Abstract
A method for attaching a diamond component to metal is described, wherein a layer of brazing material is provided at the interface between the diamond and the metal. A laser is used for heating the brazing material. The laser beam is focussed through the diamond at least substantially on the interface between the diamond and the metal.
