# Process for production of m phenoxybenzyl alcohol.

## Abstract
A process for producing m phenoxybenzyl alcohol which comprises reacting chlorobenzene with m hydroxybenzyl alcohol in the presence of a copper com pound as a catalyst and a base, characterized in that chlorobenzene is added to a polar solvent having a higher boiling point than chlorobenzene, the amount of chloroben zene being 0.05 to 4.0 times the weight of the polar solvent at least one compound selected from alkali hydroxides, alkali carbonates and alkali bicarbonates is used as the base in an amount of 1.0 to 2.0 gram equivalents per mole of m hydroxybenzyl alcohol and the reaction is carried out at a temperature of 140 to 200 C while removing the generated water as an azeotrope with chlorobenzene.
