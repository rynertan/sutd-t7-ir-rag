# A process for producing a latent heat bulkable polyethylene terephthalate yarn, the so produced yarn and its use in producing a bulked fabric.

## Abstract
A process for producing a latent heat bulkable polyethylene terephthalate yarn comprising melt spinning a polyethylene terephthalate fiber forming polymer into a plur ality of filaments 10 , cooling the melt spun filaments in quench zone 14 below the second order transition tempera ture and taking up the filaments as a yarn at a speed in excess of 8000 feet per minute, characterised in that the cooled melt spun filaments are divided into at least two groups and at least one of the groups is subjected to a heat treatment above the second order transition temperature, the filaments then being recombined.
