# NUMERICAL CONTROL METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for numerically controlling at least two tools which are arranged to move in unison while maintaining a constant positional relationship with respect to one another, the tools being moved relative to a workpiece on the basis of absolute com mands to subject the workpiece to a prescribed machin ing operation. A single current position register XR, ZR , consisting of one section XR for storing X co ordinates and one section ZR for storing Z coordinates, is provided to store the current position of a first tool. Further provided are arithmetic means AS , responsive to a command for setting coordinates, for computing the current position of a second tool which is to be used next, as well as pulse distribution means PD . The method includes the steps of storing the position of the first tool in the current position register XR, ZR prior to machining the workpiece with that tool, moving the first tool to machine the workpiece on the basis of the current position and an absolute command, computing the current position of the second tool by the arithmetic means AS in response to the command for setting coordinates in effecting a changeover from the first tool to the second tool, storing the computed current position in the current position register XR, ZR , and moving the second tool to machine the work piece on the basis of the content of the current position register XR, ZR and an absolute command.
