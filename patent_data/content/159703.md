# Thermal transfer recording apparatus.

## Abstract
A recording apparatus of thermal transfer type includes a thermal head 5 having a plurality of linearly arrayed heat generating elements selectively generating heat in re sponse to the application of a character and pattern infor mation signal providing the thermal transfer energy, and a carrier 1 having a coating of a thermally transferable re cording material. A recording medium 7 recording charac ter and pattern information is disposed between the carrier 1 and a platen roller 6 to be transported by the platen roller. At the time of recording character and pattern informa tion on the recording medium 7 , the thermal transfer ener gy is applied to the heat generating elements correspond ing to the character and pattern information signal while pressing the thermal head against the platen roller. During the recording, the thermal transfer energy is controlled to correspond to the required density tone of the character and pattern information to be recorded.
