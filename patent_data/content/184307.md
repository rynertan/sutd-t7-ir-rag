## Description
CRYSTALLINE BOROALUMINOSILICATE ZEOLITE SYNTHESIS AND USE THEREOF This invention relates to zeolite ZSM 12 containing both aluminum and boron in its anionic framework, to a method for its synthesis and to use thereof in catalytic conversion of organic compounds. ZSM 12 is generally described in US A 3,832,449.

US A 3,328,119 discloses a synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate containing a minor amount of boria in its crystal framework. Other disclosures relating to various metallosilicates include US A 3,329,480 3,329,481 and 4,299,808. US A 4,029,716 and 4,078,009 describe a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite having a silica alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and a ConstraintIndex within the approximate range of 1 to 12 having combined therewith boron in an amount of at least 0.2 weight percent as a result of reaction of the zeolite with a boron containing compound.US A 4,331,641 discloses a method for preparing a crystalline boron containing silicate having the structure of zeolite ZSM 5 from a reaction mixture containing less than 100 ppm aluminum. US A 4,104,294 discloses an organosilicate of ZSM 12 structure having a different composition from the boroaluminosilicate of the present invention that organosilicate contains less than 0.05 moles of alumina and no boron oxide. GB A 2,024,790 discloses several crystalline silica structures, though not ZSM 12, indicated to contain boron and to be devoid of any aluminum. According to the invention, zeolite ZSM 12, containing both aluminum and boron in its anionic framework, has the composition, in terms of moles of oxides per mole of silica on an anhydrous basis 1.0 0.3 a b R2 nO aB2O3 bAl2O3 SiO2 wherein R is at least one cation having the valence n, and a and b satisfy the relationships 0.0004 a b 0.04, a 0, and b 0.0004. In the synthesized form of the boroaluminosilicate, R may be an alkali or alkaline earth metal of valence n or an organic cation of a Group VA element of the Periodic Table of the Elements SargentWelch Scientific Company of valence n or a mixture thereof. The boroaluminosilicate of the present invention exhibits unique and useful catalytic, sorptive and shape selective properties, along with a silica alumina mole ratio of as high as 25,000 or even higher. It is known that catalytic activity and hydrophilic properties of aluminosilicates may decrease with increasing silica alumina mole ratio. It is also known that certain aluminosilicates, e.g. Mordenite, Beta and ZSM 35, become more difficult to synthesize as the mole ratio of silica alumina in the crystallization mixture is increased.Borosilicates M. Taramasso et al., Proceedings of theFifth International Conference on Zeolites, Heyden SonLtd., 1980, pp. 40 48 having the structure of zeolitesZSM 5, ZSM ll and Beta can be prepared, but, like the corresponding aluminosilicates, the hydrophilic properties thereof may be decreased by increasing the silica boria mole ratio. Unlike the aluminosilicate zeolites, however, the borosilicate zeolites have poor activity for acid catalyzed organic compound conversions. The boroaluminosilicate of this invention, however, overcomes the potential problems associated with high silica alumina mole ratio aluminosilicates and with borosilicates in that it exhibits unique catalytic activity and hydrophilic properties, distinguishing it from known aluminosilicates and borosilicates. The original alkali or alkaline earth metal cations of the as synthesized boroaluminosilciate can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art, at least in part, by ion exchange with other cations.Preferred replacing cations include metal ions, hydrogen ions, hydrogen precursor, e.g., ammonium, ions and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred cations are those which render the boroaluminosilicate catalyticallly active, especially for hydrocarbon conversion. These include hydrogen, rare earth metal and metals of Groups IA, IIA, IIIA, IVA, IB, IIB, IlIB, IVB and VIII of the PeriodicTable of the Elements. The lattice structure of the boroaluminosilicate of this invention, containing both boron and aluminum in tetrahedrally coordinated structural positions, is that ofZSM 12. The crystalline boroaluminosilicate of the present invention can be thermally treated, either before or after ion exchange, by heating in an atmosphere such as air, nitrogen, hydrogen, steam, etc., at a temperature of from about 3700C to about 1100C, preferably from about 3700C to about 7500C, for from about 1 minute to about 20 hours. While subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressures may be used for this thermal treatment, atmospheric pressure is desired for reasons of convenience. Zeolite ZSM 12 is defined by its x ray diffraction pattern which distinguishes it from other zeolites. The x ray diffraction pattern of the boroaluminosilicate of the present invention, having the structure of zeolite ZSM 12, is thus as set forth in the following Table TABLE 1Interplanar d Spacing Relative Intensity, I Io 11.9 0.2 10.0 0.2 W M 6.01 0.1 w 5.82 0.1 w 4.73 0.1 w 4.63 0.1 w 4.43 0.08 W 4.23 0.08 Vs 4.06 0.08 3.955 0.08 w 3.87 0.07 S 3.82 0.07 3.53 0.07 w 3.44 0.07 M 3.38 0.07 W 3.31 0.07 W 3.18 0.06 W 3.04 0.05 2.88 0.05 W 2.65 0.04 W 2.51 0.03 2.43 0.03 w 2.33 0.02 w 2.03 0.02 W 1.93 0.02 w These x ray diffraction data were collected with the Philips APD 3600 x ray system, using copper K alpha radiation.The positions of the peaks, expressed in degrees 2 theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were determined by step scanning at 0.02 degrees of 2 theta intervals and a counting time of 2 seconds for each step.The interplanar spacings, d, measured in Angstrom units A , and the relative intensities of the lines I Io, where 1o is one hundredth of the intensity of the strongest line, including subtraction of the background, were derived with the use of the software ADP Peak Algorithm . The relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols vs very strong, s strong, m medium and w weak. It should be understood that this x ray diffraction pattern is characteristic of all the species of zeolite compositions synthesized by the present invention. Ion exchange of the alkali metal cations with other ions results in a zeolite which reveals substantially the same x ray diffraction pattern with some minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. Other minor variations can occur, depending on the silica to alumina plus boron oxide ratio and the boron to aluminum plus boron ratio of the particular sample, as well as its degree of thermal treatment. Zeolite ZSM 12 exhibits an important characteristic of crystal structure of constrained access to, and egress from the intracrystalline free space by virtue of having a pore dimension greater than about 5Angstroms and pore windows of about a size such as would be provided by distorted 12 membered rings of oxygen atoms.It is to be understood, of course, that these rings are those formed by the regular disposition of the tetrahedra making up the anionic framework of the crystalline zeolite, the oxygen atoms themselves being bonded to the silicon or aluminum or boron atoms at the centers of the tetrahedra.The crystalline boroaluminosilicate of the invention freely sorbs normal hexane and cyclohexane, but provides constrained access to some larger molecules. It is sometimes possible to judge from a known crystal structure whether such constrained access exists. For example, if the only pore windows in a crystal are formed by 8 membered rings of oxygen atoms, then access by molecules of larger cross section than normal hexane or cyclohexane is substantially excluded and the zeolite is not of the present type. Zeolites with windows of distorted 12 member rings are preferred for certain reactions, although excessive puckering or pore blockage may render these zeolite substantially ineffective. Rather than attempt to judge from crystal structure whether or not a zeolite possesses the constrained access, a simple determination of the Constraint Index may be made by continuously passing a mixture of equal weight of normal hexane and 3methylpentane over a small sample, approximately 1 gram or less, of zeolite at atmospheric pressure according to the following procedure. A sample of the zeolite, in the form of pellets or extrudate, is crushed to a particle size about that of coarse sand and mounted in a glass tube.Prior to testing, the zeolite is treated with a stream of air at i0000F for at least 15 minutes. The zeolite is then flushed with helium and the temperature adjusted between 5500F and 9500F to give an overall conversion between 10 and 60 . The mixture of hydrocarbons is passed at 1 liquid hourly space velocity i.e., 1 volume of liquid hydrocarbon per volume of catalyst per hour over the zeolite with a helium dilution to give a helium to total hydrocarbon mole ratio of 4 1. After 20 minutes on Stream, a sample of the effluent is taken and analyzed, most conveniently by gas chromatography, to determine the fraction remaining unchanged for each of the two hydrocarbons. The Constraint Index is calculated as follows Constraint Index log10 fraction of n hexane remaining log10 fraction of 3 methylpentane remaining The Constraint Index approximates the ratio of the cracking rate constants for the two hydrocarbons and is 2 at 6000F for aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM 12, and from about 1 to about 4 for the boroaluminosilicate ZSM 12 of the present invention in the above temperature range of 5500F to 9500F. The crystal framework density in the dry hydrogen form of aluminosilicate ZSM 12 is about 1.8 g cc, and from about 1.75 g cc to about 1.85 g cc for the boroaluminosilicate ZSM 12 of the present invention. The as synthesized crystalline boroaluminosilicate of this invention exhibits an informative MASNMR Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear MagneticResonance spectrum. The techniques employed in obtaining such MASNMR spectra are described by C.A. Fyfe et al. in J. rbyshem. 1982, 86, 1247 1250. Under appropriate experimental conditions the 27A1 spectra show absorption also referred to as chemical shift from about 50 ppm to about 60 ppm with respect to an aqueous aluminum chloride A1C13 external standard, indicative of tetrahedral aluminum coordination in the anionic framework, and the 11B spectra show absorption chemical shift from aobut 3.5 ppm to about 6.5 ppm with respect to a borontrifluoride etherate BTE external standard, indicative of tetrahedral boron coordination in the anionic framework. As expected, the intensities of the 11B and 27A1 absorptions increase as the boron and aluminum contents of the boroaluminosilicates increase. In general, the boroaluminosilicate of the present invention can be prepared from a reaction mixture containing a source of cations, such as, for example, organic nitrogen containing cations, an alkali or alkaline earth metal ion source, a source of silicon such as, for example, a silicate, a source of aluminum such as, for example, an aluminate, water and a source of boron such as, for example, an oxide of boron, e.g. a borate or boric acid.The reaction mixture will have a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, within the following ranges with neutralization by boric acid, when present, disregarded Broad Preferred oH SiO2 0.3 0.8 0.3 0.6 H2O OH 60 500 80 300 Si02 A1203 greater than 5,000 20,000 200,000SiO2 B203 5 500 8 300R R M 0.30 0.90 0.40 0.80 wherein Rv represents organic cations and M represents alkali or alkaline earth metal ions. Reaction conditions consist of heating the foregoing reaction mixture to a temperature of from about 1000C to about 2000C for a period of time of from about 48 hours to about 100 days. A more preferred temperature range is from about 1400C to about 1800C with the amount of time at a temperature in such range being from about 100 hours to about 50 days. The digestion of the gel particles is carried out until crystals of the desired boroaluminosilicate form.The crystalline product is recovered by separating it from the reaction medium, as by cooling the whole to room temperature, filtering and washing at conditions including a pES above 7. The above reaction mixture composition can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxides. Such compositions may include sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid, sodium hydroxide, a source of aluminum, a source of boron and an appropriate organic compound. The source of aluminum may be an added aluminum containing compound or silicacontaining materials or alkali metal containing materials containing aluminum. The source of boron may be an oxide of boron such as borate or boric acid. The organic compound acts as a directing agent and contains an element of Group VA, such as nitrogen or phosphorus.Tetraethylammonium cation sources may be used to direct synthesis of boroaluminosilicate having the structure ofZSM 12 under appropriate conditions. These, in fact, are prescribed cation sources for aluminosilicate ZSM 12 inUS A 3,832,449 however, it has also been found that the boroaluminosilicate of the present invention can also be directed by a source of methyltriethylammonium cations. In selecting the reaction mixture materials, care must be taken to select substantially pure sources of silicon, aluminum and boron to insure the relatively low level of aluminum in the crystal lattice of the product.For example, if a source of silicon containing about 0.5 aluminum oxide based on solids is used, the product crystals will contain about 0.5 or more alumina, more than desired of the present boroaluminosilicate. Preferred silicon sources include fume silica e.g. Cab O Sil, having only 20 ppm alumina per 100 grams of SiO2 and tetraethylorthosilicate having about 20 ppm alumina .Likewise, aluminum sources such as a sodium aluminate and A1 NO3 3 are preferred. Another way to direct synthesis of the present boroaluminosilicate molecular sieve having the crystal structure of ZSM 12 is to provide seed crystals of the boroaluminosilicate zeolite in the reaction mixture initially, suitably in the proportion of about 0.01 percent, preferably at least about 0.1 percent and still more preferably at least about 1 percent seed based on total reaction mixture weight. Catalysts comprising a boroaluminosilicate according to the invention can be shaped into a wide variety of particle sizes. Generally speaking, they can be in the form of a powder, a granule, or a molded product, such as an extrudate having particle size sufficient to pass through a 2 mesh Tyler screen and be retained on a 400 mesh Tyler screen. In cases where the catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion, the zeolite can be extruded before drying or partially dried and then extruded. It may be desired to incorporate the new boroaluminosilicate crystal with another material resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in various organic conversion processes. Such materials include active and inactive material and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and or metal oxides, e.g. alumina, and are described in our EP A l695. Employing a catalytically active form of the boroaluminosilicate of this invention as a catalyst component, said catalyst possibly containing additional hydrogenation components, reforming stocks can be reformed employing a temperature of from about 3700C to about 5400C, a pressure of from about 100 psig 7.9 bar to about 1000 psig 69.95 bar , preferably from about 200 psig 14.8 bar to about 700 psig 49.3 bar , a liquid hourly space velocity of from about 0.1 to about 10, preferably from about 0.5 to about 4, and a hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio of from about 1 to about 20, preferably from about 4 to about 12. A catalyst comprising the boroaluminosilicate can also be used for hydroisomerization of normal paraffins, when provided with a hydrogenation component, e.g.platinum. Such hydroisomerization is carried out at a temperature of from about 900C to about 3750C, preferably from about 1450C to about 2900C, with a liquid hourly space velocity of from about 0.01 to about 2, preferably from about 0.25 to about 0.50, and with a hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio of from about 1 1 to about 5 1.Additionally, such a catalyst can be used for olefin or aromatic isomerization, employing a temperature of from about 2000C to about 4800C. Such a catalyst can also be used for reducing the pour point of gas oils. This reaction is carried out at a liquid hourly space velocity of from about 10 to about 30 and at a temperature of from about 4250C to about 5950C. Other reactions which can be accomplished employing a catalyst comprising the boroaluminosilicate containing a metal, e.g. platinum, include hydrogenationdehydrogenation reactions and desulfurization reactions, olefin polymerization oligomerization and other organic compound conversions, such as the conversion of alcohols e.g. methanol or ethers e.g. dimethylether to hydrocarbons, and the alkylation of aromatics e.g.benzene in the presence of an alkylating agent e.g.ethylene . The following Examples illustrate the nature of the invention and its manner of practice. Adsorption data for comparison of sorptive capacities for water, cyclohexane and or n hexane were determined as follows A weighted sample of the calcined adsorbant was contacted with the desired pure adsorbate vapor in an adsorption chamber, evacuated to 1 mm and contacted with 12 mm Hg of water vapor or 20 mm Hg of n hexane or cyclohexane vapor, pressures less than the vapor liquid equilibrium pressure of the respective adsorbate at room temperature.The pressure was kept constant within about 0.5 mm by addition of adsorbate vapor controlled by a manostat during the adsorption period, which did not exceed about 8 hours.As adsorbate was adsorbed, the decrease in pressure caused the manostat to open a valve which admitted more adsorbate vapor to the chamber to restore the above control pressures. Sorption was complete when the pressure. change was not sufficient to activate the manostat. The increase in weight was calculated as the adsorption capacity of the sample in g 100 g of calcined adsorbant. 3.2 grams of sodium hydroxide 98.1 NaOH and 2.1 grams of boric acid were dissolved in 207.6 grams of water. To the resulting solution were added 35.5 grams of a 50 methyltriethylammonium MTEA chloride solution and, finally, 11.8 grams of Cab O Sil fume silica. The reaction mixture was aged at 50 C for 24 hours and then heated at 1600C for crystallization. The reaction mixture had the following composition S102 Al203 35r400 Six2 3203 11.2 MTEA MTEA Na 0.60 OH SiO2 0.41 disregarding partial neutralization by H3BO3 2O oH 163 A crystalline product was obtained after 24 days at 1600C.
