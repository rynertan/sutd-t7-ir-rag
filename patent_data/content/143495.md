# X ray analysis apparatus comprising a deflection system.

## Abstract
In order to prevent disturbing effects on the measurement signal resulting from the detection of extraneous charged parti cles by the detector in an X ray analysis apparatus, a collimating element for the X ray beam is arranged in front of the detector and provided with a deflection system for charged particles. When the deflection system is made of permanent magnetic material which is arranged near or in a collimator, the construction of the apparatus need not be further modified.

## Description
X ray analysis apparatus comprising a deflection system. The invention relates to an X ray analysis apparatus, which comprises an X ray source, a specimen carrier and an X ray detector which is arranged, when viewed along the propagation direction of an X ray beam generated in a specimen to be examined, beyond a collimating member for the X ray beam. In known apparatus as described in US 3,852,594 charged particles, notably electrons which are gene rated, for example, by the X ray beam and which penetrate the detector, have a disturbing effect The charged particles cause a background signal which has a disturbing effect notably on the measurement of longwave length X rays, i.e.during the analysis of specimens including elements having a comparatively low atomic number, because the detector entrance windows to be used in those circumstances, only absorb the particles to a small extent and the detection signal generated by each X ray quantum is not substantially greater than that for said particle. Charged particles such as electrons and ions can be released by the X ray beam from the specimen, and from irradiated structural parts of the apparatus such as an X ray beam collimating member and the like. It is an object of the invention to protect the detector against the incidence of charged particles without loss of sensitivity for, notably, longwave length X rays and without giving rise to disturbing effects. To this end, an X ray analysis apparatus of the kind set forth is characterized in that a deflection system for charged particles which is shielded as regards disturbing stray fields, is arranged near the collimating member. Because the charged particles in an X ray analysis apparatus in accordance with the invention are deflected away from the detector entrance, they will not form part of the detector signal a substantial improvement in the signalto noise ratio of the detection signal will thus be obtained notably for the analysis of light elements. Deflection can be achieved, for example by means of a local electrostatic or magnetic field. In a preferred embodiment deflection takes place by means of a magnetic deflection field which is introduced into the X ray beam path in front of the detector and whose extension to the specimen, the X ray source and the detector is restricted by means of a magnetic shield. To achieve this, for example permanent magnetic material may be included in or near a locally arranged collimating member.The magnetic material may be included notably in the laminae which form a collimator, or be arranged at the sides thereof or take the place of the spacers between the laminae. Suitable shielding of the magnetic field is provided by a magnetic shield arranged about the collimator and comprising the permanent magnetic material. For suitable reproducibility and reliability of the apparatus, proper shielding against stray fields is extremely desirable in X ray spectrometers in which the detector and the associated collimating member rotate with respect to the specimen and the X ray source in order to perform a 2 type of displacement. In sumultaneous spectrometers in which the detector often comprises photomultiplier tubes, it is important to take this into account with respect to the shielding. The invention can be used notably for sequential and simultaneous Spectrometers. For the analysis of elements having a low atomic number, for example lower than approximately 20, the local deflection of charged particles in such apparatus readily results in an improvement of the signal to noise ratio of the detection signal by a factor of two. Some preferred embodiments in accordance with the invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the drawing. Therein Figure 1 shows a sequential X ray spectrometer which includes a detector collimator provided with a deflection system in accordance with the invention, and Figure 2 shows a simultaneous X ray spectrometer which includes a detector gap provided with such a deflection system. Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically a sequential X ray spectrometer, comprising an X ray source 1 with a radiation filter 2, a specimen 4, a primary collimator 6, a crystal changer 8, which in this case comprises five different analyser crystals 10, and an X ray detector 12 with a secondary collimator 14. Using a known mechanism not shown , the detector can be rotated about a point of rotation 16 in order to perform the required 2 commat type of displacement, so that an X ray spectrum can be recorded. For recording and processing such a spectrum, use is made of an electronic circuit 18 which is also capable of controlling the angular position of the detector with respect to the specimen. The appropriate radiation spectrum for an X ray beam 20 generated by the X ray tube, is provided for analysis by selection of the anode material, the high voltage used in the X ray tube, and the filter 2 arranged in the beam path.The X ray beam 20 causes fluorescence in the specimen. AnX ray beam 22 thus generated contains a pattern of radiation which is characteristic of elements in the specimen. The various characteristic radiation peaks in a beam 24 are spatially separated viewed through the angle e, by diffraction at an analyser crystal 10. This spectrum can subsequent ly be measured by means of the detector. In accordance with the invention a deflection system for charged particles is added to the collimator 14 in this embodiment. As is shown in detail in Fig. la, notably a permanent magnet 25 is arranged at both sides of the collimator. For field shielding, the magnets are enclosed by a shielding cage 26 which consists of, for example, nickel iron.For the sake of clarity, the direction of a magnetic deflection field H is shown in Fig. la for an X ray beam direction perpendicular with respect to the plane of the drawing of Figure la. In a further embodiment, the permanent magnetic material is included in the laminar structure of the collimator. This can be achieved, for example, by making each lamina 27, or some of the laminae, of a permanent magnetic material or by adding a permanent magnetic material thereto.In a preferred embodiment, spacers 28 between the laminae of the collimator are made of a permanent magnetic material.In this embodiment, the collimator is once again shielded by a soft magnetic material in the described manner, and its construction need not be significantly modified. Fig. 2 diagrammatically shows a simultaneous X ray spectrometer which comprises an X ray source 30, a specimen 32, a first detection system 34 with a primary radiation gap 36, an analysis crystal 38 which is curved in this case, and a detector 40 with a secondary radiation gap 42 and a second detection system 44 with an analysis crystal 46, which is flat in this case, a primary collimator 48, and a detector 50 with a secondary collimator 52. Between the crystal 38 and the detector gap 42 there is again provided a permanent magnetic material for the lateral deflection of the electrons present in a space 54 consequently, these electrons will not pass through the detector gap 42. The permanent magnetic material is in this case formed, for example by two magnets 56. In order to reduce the stray fields generated by the deflection system, a magnetic shield 58 of a soft magnetic material is again arranged about the collimating member incorporating the permanent magnetic material. A collimator 60 of the second detection system 44 can also be provided with a magnetic deflection system as described with reference to Fig. la a permanent magnetic material is then preferably incorporated in or about the collimator, for example, in the form of permanent magnets 62 which are arranged at both sides thereof. The collimator incorporating the magnetic material is, in similar manner, shielded against stray fields by means of a shielding sleeve 64 of a soft magnetic material. Deflection can also be performed in an electromagnetic or an electrostatic manner similar to that described for a mangetic deflection system. For electrostatic deflection, laminae of a collimator are preferably maintained at different potentials. Consequently, the laminae must be electrically insulated from one another and be provided with supply leads. Electrostatic deflection has the advantage that a higher degree of freedom exists as regards the adjustment of the intensity of the deflection field it is a drawback, however, in that the presence of supply leads is often inconvenient. A high degree of freedom of adjustment is also obtained in the case of electromagnetic deflection utilizing, for example a magnetic coil whose field is effective in the vicinity of the collimating member. It could be a drawback that it would be more difficult to shield such a coil moreover, such a shielded coil requires a comparatively large amount of space. Notably when a permanent magnetic material is used, suitable stray field shield can be provided without requiring a large additional amount of space, so that the apparatus need not be significantly modified.
