## Abstract
The present invention relates to a board game of skill and provides three boards adapted to be disposed vertically one above the other or laid in a line through their axis. Each board has a plurality of zones extending outwardly from a central region in a plurality of directions. Preferably the zones are defined by concentric circles and radially spaced outwardly extending lines. Two sets of playing pieces are provided and are movable from one zone to another zone. Forty eight pieces are assigned to each board and are only permitted to move on the board to which they are assigned. The remaining six senior pieces are permitted to move from one board to another. The layout of the board allows the pieces to move circumferentially, radially or spirally, as prescribed by the rules.

## Description
DESCRIPTION BOARD GAMES The present invention relates to board games. Board games generally fall into two classes, those which relay on chance, for example where dice are shaken to determine the movement of a piece and those which use skill, in which the pieces are allowed to make certain moves, the movement of the pieces being determined by the player usually according to some strategy planned to achieve the object of the game. Some games involve a combination of skill and chance. The present invention relates to a new game of skill. According to the present invention there is provided a board game comprising three boards each having a plurality of zones extending outwardly from a central region in a plurality of directions, two sets of pieces used in conjunction with the three boards which pieces are movable from one zone to another zone, a number of the pieces, the board pieces, being assigned to each board and being permitted to move only on the board to which they are assigned, the remaining pieces, the master pieces, being permitted to move from one boared to another. In a preferred embodiment the plurality of zones are spaced radially and circumferentially about the central region, at least some of said pieces being permitted to move both circumferentially and radially, at the same time, between zones so as to describe an inwardly or outwardly directed arcuate path. Other pieces are permitted to move circumferentially around the central region between adjacent zones. Conveniently each board has a plurality of concentric circles and a plurality of lines extending radially outwardly from the central region dividing the board into the plurality of zones, each zone having four edges defining four corners, two sets of pieces, some of which pieces may move between zones which have adjacent edges. Other pieces may move between zones whose edges are not adjacent but whose corners are adjacent. In a preferred embodiment each board has nine annular regions which extend outwardly from the central region and which are concentric with each other, each annular region being divided into eighteen zones, so as to divide the board into one hundred and sixty two zones. Some of the pieces of the two sets of pieces used with the boards are allowed to move between zones which have adjacent edges or adjacent corners but are not permitted to move into and out of the innermost annular zone. Preferably each set of pieces consists of forty five individual pieces, including three sub sets of thirteen pieces being assigned to move on a respective one of the three boards the remaining six pieces of the set the master pieces being permitted to move the boards in a prescribed manner. Each sub set of thirteen pieces comprises three distinctively shaped pieces which move in different sways on the board and the remaining six pieces are each differently shaped and are able to move in a particular way. Each sub set of thirteen pieces comprises nine pieces which are permitted to move from one zone to another zone which other zone has either an edge or a corner adjacent to the said one zone but can only move one zone per move. Two pieces of each sub set are permitted to move between zones having adjacent corners any number of zones per move and in an arcuate path outwardly to the outermost annular region and then inwardly in an arcuate path on the same move.Two pieces of the sub set are permitted to move between zones having adjacent edges any number of zones per move but may not move into the innermost annular region. In a further preferred embodiment two of the six pieces, which may move from one board to another, are permitted to move between zones having adjacent corners any number of zones per move and must move into the central region in order to move onto the next board. Preferably for the purposes of playing the game the three boards are considered to be in series one above the other whereby the pieces permitted to move boards may move vertically from one board to another so as to depart from a discrete zone on one board and arrive at a discrete zone on another board considered to be vertically above or below the said one board. Preferably at least one of the pieces able to move between boards may move any number of levels in one move by way of the central region. Two of the pieces movable between boards , which move between zones having adjacent edges any number of zones per move but are excluded from moving into the innermost annular region or central region, move from a discrete zone on one board to a discrete zone on another board, which discrete zones are considered to be vertically above or below one another. At least one of two pieces movable between zones having adjacent edges may move more than one level per move. In a further preferred feature one piece can move between zones having adjacent edges and adjacent corners any number of zones per move and may move between levels using the central region and by moving vertically between discrete zones. One piece may move between zones having adjacent edges or corners but only one zone per move and only vertically to a discrete zone one board above or below per move. The present invention will now be described further by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a plan view of one embodiment of a board on which the game is played Fis. 2 to 10 illustrate the distinctive pieces of one embodiment of the invention Figs. 11 to 14 illustrate the possible basic moves of the pieces and Fig. 15 is a perspective view of the three boards with the pieces laid out in their starting positions. Fig. 1 illustrates a board of the type on which the game is to be played by two opposing sides or teams each having a set of playing pieces. The playing area of the board is divided into nine annular regions and a central region by a plurality of concentric circles. Extending outwardly from the central region are a plurality of radial lines which divide the board into eighteen segments and which divide each of the annular regions into eighteen zones. Thus the board is divided into one hundred and sixty two zones. In the illustrated embodiment each zone has four edges, two of which are straight and two of which are curved. The four edges define four corners of the zone. Zones which are adjacent and which are in the same annular region have one straight edge which is common to the two adjacent zones. Zones which are adjacent and which are in the same segment have one curved edge which is common to the two adjacent zones. Whilst this arrangement represents a preferred arrangement the basic feature of the zones is that they are spaced circumferentially and extend radially from a central region. Thus the zones could be any other convenient shape for example circles and it is not essential that the zones are adjacent and have common edges. They could quite easily be spaced apart in the circumferential and radial directions. Each segment is equal in area and has an included angle of 200. The radial depth of each annular region is equal in the illustrated arrangement. However, the segments need not be equal in area neither need the radial depth of the annular regions be equal. Each zone may be numbered to enable its position to be identified more easily. In the illustrated embodiment the numbering is clockwise and commences at number one in the innermost annular region. The next annular region being numbered anti clockwise.The direction of the numbering alternates in each annular region so as to give a more random numbering system. However the zones may quite easily be identified by another method, for example by giving a letter to each of the annular regions and a number to each of the segments. The innermost annular region is termed an event horizon and the central region is termed black hole . The significance of these terms will be explained later in the description. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the game is played on three identically marked boards as described above. Preferably the boards are made from a transparent or opaque plastics material with the edges of the zones outline on the board. The boards are aligned with one another so that they are spaced apart with identical zones aligned vertically. In an alternative arrangement the boards may be made from card or pressed board with the pattern on one side and in this instance the boards are placed side by side.The radial line between zones 145 and 162 representing an axis, each radial line on each board being aligned to form one axis running continuously through all the boards. Conveniently all the zones numbered 162 are positioned on the same side of the centre of each board.It is not necessary to align the boards, but alignment makes movement of the pieces easier. The three boards are referred to as levels one, two and three. Level one being at the bottom, level three at the top and level two in between, when the boards are spaced vertically. The zones may be any other convenient shape rather than the preferred shape described. For example they may be circular,square, oval, triangular or polygonal. The zones do not have to adjoin one another and they may be clear, see through, or coloured, including full spectrum colour or black and white.Neither is it necessary to have 162 zones although this number reduces to the number nine which forms the basis for the game. Nine is the total number of fighting pieces on each level for each player the total of each players number of pieces 54 reduces to nine the total number of pieces 90 reduces to nine.The board number layout is based on a frequency of nine.Nine is the basis for play for without this zone, odds and evens, would not fit as they also represent black and white zones. Three boards and two sets of pieces are used and preferably the game is played by two people. Each set of pieces consists of 45 pieces and names have been assigned to the pieces to make description easier and to distinguish between pieces which are capable of different types of moves. Each of the differently named pieces are different in appearance. Figs. 2 to 10 illustrate the different pieces. There are forty five pieces per set in the three board game making a total of ninety pieces. The number of different pieces is shown in the table below. To distinguish between the two sets of pieces one will be referred to as the gold piece set and the other referred to as the silver piece set. The pieces named War Lords , Henges and people are collectively known as board pieces because they are assigned to a particular board.The board pieces may be divided into three sub sets of thirteen pieces consisting of two War Lords two Henges and nine People . The preferred starting positions of the pieces on the board are as detailed in the table herebelow.Name of No. of Gold Piece Silver PiecePiece Pieces Set Zone Set Zone per set Number Number or sideWizard 1 162 153Life Force 1 145 154White Goddess 1 127 136King Arthur 1 144 135Centurion 1 126 117Shogun 1 109 118War Lord 6 91,73 100,82Henge 6 108,90 99,81Fighting Piece 27 161,128, 152,137, People 125,92, 116,101, 89,146, 80,155, 145,110, 134,119, 107 98 Each of the three boards has on each board or level a sub set of board pieces namely War Lords , Henges and People and each sub set is positioned as identified above. Each set or side has six so called titled pieces namely the remaining six pieces which do not constitute board pieces. The titled pieces of one set, preferably the gold piece set, are positioned on level one and in the other set the titled pieces are positioned on level three at the start of the game in the zones indicated in the accompanying table. It has been mentioned that the central region is termed the black hole and the innermost annular region the event horizon . In black hole physics a physical entity entering the event horizon is lost to the black hole. The same rules can be applied to the pieces of the game. The following pieces, namely Life Force1,, King Arthur , Centurion , Henge , War Lord and Fighting pieces all have physical entity and if they enter the event horizon they are lost. If any of these pieces enter the event horizon they are removed from the board. The Wizard White Goddess and Shogun pieces are considered for the purposes of the game not to exist as physical entities and therefore they are able to enter the event horizon and make use of the black hole. The movements of the pieces may be referred to as movements in the horizontal plane, i.e. movements in the plane of a board and movements in the vertical direction, i.e between one or more boards or levels. There are two basic moves in the horiontal plane.The first illustrated with reference to Fig. 11 is movement of the pieces between zones which have adjacent edges. Thus a piece may move to a zone which is in the same annular region or which is within the same segment. The second movement illustrated with reference toFig. 12 is movement between zones which do not have adjacent edges but which have adjacent corners. Thus the piece moves to a different annular region and a different segment at the same time. There are two basic moves in the vertical direction. In the first illustrated with reference to Fig.13 the piece is required to move into the central region or black hole in order to move from one level to another. In the second type of vertical movement illustrated in Fig. 14 the piece moves from a discrete zone on one level to an identical zone on another level. The named pieces and their permitted movements are outlined below Fig. 2 illustrates the Wizard piece. In theHorizontal plane the Wizard can move through straight edges or corners, it cannot change direction in the middle of a move. This piece can move any number of squares until a piece is taken or location required is achieved. In the vertical plane the wizard can move through the event horizon up or down. Wait in the EventHorizon, use the Black hole as a doorway to other boards. The Wizard can go through a black hole and change from diagonal direction to squared logical direction. Additionally the Wizard is able to move vertically number to number plane to plane any number of squares or segments. The Wizard piece can take any other piece except when surrounded by its own pieces, its own pieces obviously cannot be taken. The Wizard piece is the only piece on the boards which can take vertically e.g. if it is on 27 bottom and 27 middle is clear, and on the top 27 there is aHenge or any other piece for that matter, then theWizard is the only piece which can take any piece in any direction. The Wizard has the most freedom of any piece on the board, for it is after all the Wizards game.The Wizard is able to use all the dimensions or boards, it is also able to use the Black Hole and the Event Horizon freely. The Wizard is the only piece on the Boards which can take from above and below, from one dimension to another. Fig. 3 illustrates the Life Force piece. As the name describes, this piece represents the life of the opponent or the spirit if played by a team of players. In the horizontal plane the Life Force piece moves through straight edges or through corners one square only each move. The Life Force can move vertically from one discrete zone to another. It may only move vertically one board or level per move. The Life Force when endangered can be taken by any piece on the board. A defensive move must be made against the offender. The Life Force cannot take any other piece. The game is lost when the Life Force is taken or endangered beyond escape. In other words the life is lost. When the Life Force is endangered the life force piece can be defended by any piece belonging to the life force, taking the piece effecting the danger. Fig. 4 illustrates the piece called King Arthur . In the horizontal plane this piece can move around the board through the straight edges of the zones i.e. between zones having adjacent edges for that reason it is a Logic piece in the game of TALIESIN. Once moving it cannot change direction. This piece can move any number of zones until a piece is taken or location required is achieved. Vertically this piece does not move through the Black Hole, to achieve another plane, i.e. another board or level, in the game it must move on available blank segments, i.e. 24 to 24, it can move any number of planes at one time. The King Arthur cannot take other pieces on the vertical plane. King Arthur can take any other piece on the board as for the White Goddess. Fig. 5 illustrates the piece called the White Goddess . In the horizontal plane this piece can move across any of the boards through the corners of segments only, i.e. between zones having adjacent corners. It cannot change direction in the middle of a move. It can move through corners any number of zones until a piece is taken or location required is achieved. Vertically this piece moves through the black hole and the event horizon, up or down the boards. If it goes through the black hole then it cannot change direction, this piece must always come out of an eent horizon and travel through corners. The White Goddess piece can move any number of planes up or down and can remain in the event horizon indefinitely. The White Goddess can take any piece on the board and can endanger the Life Force. Fig. 6 illustrates the Shogun piece. This piece moves as for the White Goddess on the Horiontal plane. Namely it moves between zones having adjacent corners any number of zones per move. This piece can only go through the Black Holey to change levels. Vertically it can only move one level every move. For example, it cannot move from level one to level three but must move from level one to level two. On the next move it can go on to level three. The Shogun can take any other piece, and en danger the life force. Fig. 7 illustrates the Centurion piece. This moves as for King Arthur on the Horizontal plane, namely between zones having adjacent edges and any number of zones per move. Vertically it moves as for the King Arthur piece with the exception that it can only move one level at a time as for the Kremlin piece. This piece can go from zone to zone on different levels vertically. This movement can only be on squares which are black and available for use. It cannot use the black hole. The 1 Centurion can take any other piece and endanger the Life Force. Fig. 8 illustrates the War Lord piece which is the senior board piece. In the Horizontal plane theWar Lord moves between zones having adjacent corners any number of zones per move. When the outside is reached in the same move it is able to move back into the centre as long as it continues in the same direction of rotation. This piece can therefore move in either direction, i.e. inwardly and outwardly on one move. This piece cannot move vertically between boards or levels. The War Lord piece can take those pieces which are in a zone into which it arrives through a corner. The War Lord piece can take any piece on the board, and can endanger the Life Force piece. Fig. 9 illustrates the Henge or Dolman Arch piece which is also a board piece and is the logic piece on each board, it cannot move from board to board. In the horizontal plane this piece moves on this plane as for the King Arthur and Centurion pieces. Namely between zones having adjacent edges any number of zones per move, odd or even identification. This piece cannot move vertically between boards or levels. The Henge piece can take those pieces which are in a zone into which it arrives through an edge. The Henge piece can take any piece on the board, and it can only endanger the Life Force in its normal method of moving. The Henge piece is the logic piece on every board, this title is given to it for it is possible for a player to keep the two pieces together and control two or more areas at once, i.e. it is possible for two henges placed correctly to control two radiating circles and two segments at the same time thus controlling in total 54 squares on each board. Finally Fag. 10 illustrates a Fighting Piece or People Piece of which there are 27 per side there are nine on each board and they cannot move from board to board. In the horizontal plane this piece can move in any direction on any move, it cannot move more than one segment at a time. This piece cannot move vertically between boards or levels. The Fighting or People pieces can take any piece on the board on which they are positioned, providing they they enter a segment which is already occupied by an opponent. The board game may be played according to three sets of rules. However regardless of which rules are used the object of the game is to take the Life Force of the opponent. In so doing the opponent ,i s killed. A draw is conceeded when the Life Force cannot be taken or endangered by the opponent. The preferred rules are the Aesir Rules in which the game is played between two players on three levels, thus demanding logic and perception, in a unique manner. All the permitted moves for the pieces as described hereinbefore are used. Each player moves one piece alternately. The purest form of TALIESIN . The alternative rules are as follows The Travellers Rules , in which the game is played by two teams. Three or four players may take part. In the case of four players, each team consists of two players referred to as a lead player and support player. The lead player of each team is responsible for moving the titled or senior pieces on any of the three boards, and the board or minor pieces on one board the top board in the case of the silver pieces and the bottom board in the case of the gold pieces. The support player of each team is responsible for moving the board pieces on the other two boards.The lead player moves first followed by the support player of the same team, then lead player and support player of other team. No conferring is allowed between leader and support players. In all other respects the game is played according to the Aesir Rules . When three play, one team of two takes on one player taking the part of lead and support player. Finally, the Wizards Circle Rules in which five, six, seven or eight players can take part. Where eight play, each team has a captain and three as support players. When six play, the captain takes the role of one of the support players. Each support player plays on one board only. The captain is the only person allowed to move the titled or senior pieces. Each team moves four pieces simultaneously, one senior piece and three board pieces, first one team then the other in reply. No conferring is allowed between the players of each team In all other respects the game is played according to the Aesir Rules . When five play, one player takes on a team of four, and when seven play a team of four play a team of three.
