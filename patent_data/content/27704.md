# SURGICAL SNARE APPARATUS

## Abstract
A surgical cannula apparatus includes a sheath 32 having proximal and distal ends, a flexible member 34 in the sheath and movable longitudinally therein, the member 34 having proximal and distal ends, and a surgical instru ment 104 operable by movement of the member 34 with respect to the sheath. The apparatus further includes an operating device 10 comprising a body 12 which slidably receives a slide 48 for movement longitudinaily of the body. The body 12 has a generally cylindrical interior and the slide 48 has a pair of longtudinally spaced walls 44,46 of circular shape. The walls have aligned apertures which rotatably receive a stem 70 which has proximal and distal ends, and the proximal end of the flexible member 34 is fixed to the distal end of the stem 70 . The proximal end of the sheath 32 is fixed to the body 12 . The stem has a thumbwheel 84 accessible through the wall of the body, the thumbwheel being manipulatable to rotate the membar 34 in the sheath 32 . The slide 48 includes a rack and the body supports an additional thumbwheel 58 having gear teeth which engage the rack. Manipulation of the second thumbwheel causes the slide 48 to move longitudinally within the body to move the flexible member 34 longitudinally in the sheath.
