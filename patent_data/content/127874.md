# CATALYST AND METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF ALKYLAMINES

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved catalyst and method for the selective production of alkylamines. More particularly, it is concerned with the preparation of stable highly active catalysts for producing alkylamines by a cataly tic reaction of ammonia or substituted amines and binary synthesis gas CO Hâ‚‚ .
