## Description
This invention relates to passivating the surface of silicon. It is well known that the termination of a semiconductor lattice at the surface of a wafer results in an electronic configuration at the surface drastically different from that found within the bulk of the semiconductor. Situations such as distorted bonds or unsatisfied dangling bonds at the surface create electronic states within the semiconductor s forbidden energy gap. Such electronic states are localized and therefore can trap and immobilize charge and thereby degrade the performance of the device. For example in field effect transistors FET s the storage of charge in surface states increases the gate capacitance, adversely affecting the high frequency response of such devices. Since such stored charge is immobile it does not contribute to current flow in the FET channel reducing the device transconductance.In photovoltaic devices, such surface states act as recombination centers for photogenerated electrons and holes reducing the output current and voltage delivered by such devices and thereby limiting their energy conversion efficiencies. In conventional semiconductor device technology, crystalline silicon remains the dominant material out of which active devices are fabricated. A crucial c i 1 1 property of silicon which has to a great measure been responsible for its technological importance is the existence of its oxide SiO2 which when carefully grown on the surface of a wafer forms an excellent surface passivation layer nearly eliminating all surface states at the silicon SiO2 interface.Surface state densities may be as low as 1010 cm2 approximately 1 105 surface atoms . The preparation of such well passivated oxidized silicon surfaces is difficult. It requires the proper preoxidation cleaning and etching followed by a high temperature greater than 10000C oxidation step, see e.g. M. M. Atalla, E. Tannenbaum, and E. J. Scheibner,Bell. Sys. Tech. J., 749 May, 1959 . As well as being a costly energy consuming process high temperature oxidation of silicon is susceptible to the degradation of the silicon wafer due to the mobility of dopants and impurities at such elevated temperatures. Non oxidative surface treatments of silicon have been attempted involving treatment with a variety of etchants, see, e.g., T. M. Buck and F. S. McKim, J.Electrochem. Soc. 105, 709 1958 . However, such passivations were found to be inferior to thermally grown oxides and subject to degradation in room atmosphere. Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to overcome the problems associated with the high temperature oxidation process and produce a passivated silicon surface whose surface state density was as low as that for thermally oxidized surfaces. Such a process should be a simple low temperature process and produce a passivated surface stable under atmospheric conditions. The present invention concerns a method for producing an electronically passivated surface on silicon which compr s the steps of exposing said surface to HF, maintaining said surface in an inert atmosphere, and coating said surface with an air impermeable diffusion barrier.In the drawings Figure la shows the photoconductive decay of a 250 4 thick crystalline silicon wafer subsequent to immersion of the wafer in aqueous HF and coating with a thin tetracene film. Figure lb shows the photoconductive decay of a 250 thick crystalline silicon wafer subsequent to immersion in aqueous HF, coating with a thin rubrene film, and overcoating with a thin MgF2 film, as measured in air. Figure 2a shows the apparatus employed to treat and passivate crystalline silicon wafers according to the present invention. Figure 2b shows an alternative to a portion of the apparatus of Fig. 2a. Figure 3 shows three generic semiconductor devices which may advantageously employ the present invention for passivation of the surface of crystalline silicon. This invention provides a technique for producing on crystalline silicon stable electronically passivated surfaces. The wafers thus produced may then be processed into a variety of active semiconductor devices. By electronically passivated we mean that the surfaces of the wafers have a very low density of surface electronic states whose energies are within the forbidden energy gap of the bulk silicon. We have monitored the effectiveness of our passivation technique by measuring the photoconductive lifetime of injected charge in wafers treated in accordance with our invention , see, e.g., T. Tiedje, J. I. Haberman, R. W. Francis, and A.K. Ghosh, J. Appl. Phys. 54, 2499 1983 . Such lifetimes may be directly related to the density of surface states,EMI4.1 where Qsurf is the photoconductive lifetime of injected carriers due to a surface density of states Nst on a wafer of thickness L. or is the charge capture cross section for these states typically 10 15 cm2 vth is a thermal velocity 107 cm s . Figures la and b show photoconductive decay curve for a 250 thick crystalline silicon wafers treated in accordance with our invention. They indicate a photoconductive lifetimes of 900 as which implies from the above formula a surface density of states of 1.4 x 109 states cm2 which is equivalent to the density obtained using the best thermal oxides. Figure 2a shows the apparatus employed to treat and passivate crystalline silicon wafers according to the present invention. The wafer 1 is first degreased in an ultrasonic cleaner and mounted on a teflon rod 2 in a treatment chamber 3. The chamber 3 is a stainless steel cross with six vacuum flanges. Two of the flanges, one into the page and the other out of the page, are not shown in Fig. 2. One contains electrical feed throughs leading to a coil which is inductively coupled to the silicon wafer 1. The second flange has a quartz window. These flanges permit direct monitoring of the effects of the treatment and coating procedures described in the present invention via an in situ measurement of the photoconductive lifetime without removing the wafer from the inert atmosphere of the cross, see T. Tiedje, J. Haberman, R.W. Francis, and A. K. Ghosh, J. Appl. Phys. 54, 2499 1983 . The interior of the cross is coated with teflon. The sample rod passes through a vacuum 4 seal which permits both rotary and up and down translation of the rod so that the sample may be manipulated in the chamber. The treatment chamber is flushed through valves 5 and 6 with an inert gas such as Ar or He to remove all air from the chamber. A teflon chamber 7 partially filled with a 49 aqueous solution of HF is suspended below the treatment chamber with an air tight compression seal 8. The HF chamber 7 is separated from the treatment chamber with a gate valve 9. The HF chamber is also flushed with inert gas to eliminate air from this chamber as well through ports 10 and 11. When all the air has been flushed from chambers 3 and 7 gate valve 9 is opened and the wafer 1 is lowered until it is completely immersed in the hydrofluoric acid shown as dotted line in Fig. 2a . It remains immersed for a period of time from 30s to 60s.It is then withdrawn from the acid back into the upper chamber 3 and gate valve 9 is sealed closed. What the immersion in the HF has accomplished is the removal of the native oxide from the wafer surfaces and the fluorination of these surfaces, see, e.g., G. B.Larabee, K. G. Heinen, S. A. Harrel, J. Electrochem. Soc. 114, 867 1967 . The surfaces so treated are well passivated as indicated by long photoconductive lifetimes, see Figure 1. An alternate technique has also been successfully employed to treat the surface of silicon wafers with hydrofluoric acid. It is shown in Figure 2b. Instead of immersing the wafer directly in aqueousHF in the teflon chamber 7, the wafer is exposed only to HF H20 vapor. This is accomplished by bubbling an inert carrier gas argon through valve 31 into a polypropylene bottle 28 containing a 49 aqueous HF solution 29. The exit stream of gas Ar HF H20 30 is introduced into the treatment chamber through valve 5 and leaves through valve 6. We have obtained high photoconductive lifetimes on silicon wafers subject to this HF vapor treatment, lifetimes equivalent to that obtained with the immersion technique. The wafers are now ready for further processing. A crucial aspect of our technique is that all passivation steps are performed in an inert atmosphere.The measured lifetime of the fluorinated surface rapidly degrades upon exposure to air. The next step in processing requires the deposition of a protective overlayer to protect the passivated surface from air degradation. The requirements for this overlayer are it must be an effective barrier preventing air from reaching the passivated surfaces it must be chemically inert, not disturbing the fluorinated surface it must be simple to deposit by low temperature processes. It has been discovered that one such overlayer involves first the deposition of a thin film of a polynuclear aromatic organic solid by thermal evaporation onto the wafer held at room temperature. The procedure employed is as follows. Subsequent to the HF immersion step described above, the treatment chamber 3 is evacuated by opening the gate valve connecting it to the evaporation source chamber 13 which is pumped to pressures of 2 x10 6 torr by the diffusion pump 14. It has been found by monitoring the photoconductive lifetime with the inductively coupled contactless technique, see e.g., T. Tiedje, J. I. Haberman, R. W.Francis, and A. K. Ghosh, J. Appl. Phys. 54, 2499 1983 , that such a pumpout step does not degrade the lifetime of the passivated wafer. The thermal evaporation sources 15 are then used to coat the wafer. Both sides of the wafer may be so coated by rotating the sample rod 2. Examples of polynuclear aromatic organic solids we have employed as overlayers are tetracene 2,3 benzanthracene and rubrene tetraphenyl napthacene . Figure la shows the photoconductive decay of a 250 4thick crystalline silicon wafer subsequent to immersion of the wafer in aqueous HF and coating with a thin tetracene film. A key property of the organic film is that it isolates the passivated fluorinated surface from subsequent overlayers. For example, we have coated an HF immersed wafer with aMgF2 overlayer. The overlayer of MgF2 was also deposited from a thermal evaporation source 15.When the MgF2 was evaporated directly onto the fluorinated surface a severe degradation of the photoconductive lifetime was observed. However, when a thin film of rubrene was deposited prior to the MgF2 deposition a long lifetime was maintained. Such an overlayer ofMgF2 can serve an important function. It provides an air impermeable diffusion barrier superior to that of the organic alone preventing degradation of the surface passivation when the wafer is brought into atmospheric air. Figure lb shows the photoconductive decay of a 250 thick crystalline silicon wafer coated with rubrene and MgF2 as measured in air. The measured photoconductive lifetime implies a surface passivation resulting in on the order of one electrically active surface state per 105 surface atoms, even after exposure to air. Figure 3 shows three generic semiconductor devices which may advantageously employ the present invention for passivation of the surface of crystalline silicon. Figure 3a shows a generic metal insulator semiconductor MIS device which consists of a substrate of crystalline silicon 16 an HF passivated surface 17, a thin organic overlayer 18, and a metal top contact 19. Such devices may be employed as photovoltaic devices, voltage variable capacitors, or in arrays as charge storage devices CCD . In each application optimal performance depends upon a well passivated surface. The device portrayed in Figure 3A takes advantage also of the high electrical resistivity of the polynuclear aromatic organic film which serves as the insulator in the MIS structure. Figure 3b shows a generic metal insulator semiconductor field effect transistor MISFET . It consists of a crystalline silicon substrate either n or p type diffused source 21 and drain 22 contacts of opposite conductivity type to the base n or p , a passivated surface 23 on which a thin polynuclear aromatic organic insulating film 24 is deposited and a metallic gate electrode 25. Figure 3c shows a generic p n diffused junction device which may be opera ted as a photovoltaic cell. It consists of a base 26 crystalline silicon wafer of one conductivity type either p or n in which a junction 27 with the opposite type conductivity has been diffused. The passivation of the surfaces of this device may be accomplished according to this invention by only low temperature steps HF immersion and organic thin film 28 deposition onto the device held at room temperature. As the passivation steps are performed with the device at room temperature the doping profile established by the diffusion process is not disturbed.
