# Prepasted wallcoverings.

## Abstract
Prepasted wallcovering comprising a porous surface that carries a dry coating of polymer particles that become adhesive when wetted by water is made by applying to the surface a dis persion of the particles in a non aqueous liquid that is stabilised by a polymeric stabiliser and then evaporating the non aqueous liquid. A dried residue of the dispersion must not form a coher ent film and should have a softening point substantially in dependent of the softening point of the polymeric stabiliser. The polymeric stabiliser is preferably an oil. The non aqueous liquid is preferably relatively non volatile.
