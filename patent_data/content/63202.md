## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Nhe present invention relates to the filtering cartridges for fluid filtering systems, in particular for filtering air or other gases, of the type in which two supporting permeable walls are located one within the other with a filtering septum located in the space therebetween. These filtering cartridges, in the use condition thereof,are inserted into casing therethrough the gas to be filtered is caused to flow, and the known cartridges being affected by great drawbacks.Firstly the surface thereof originally contacting the fluid or gas to be filtered tends to clog very quickly and, after a comparatively snort period of time,because of said clogging,a high pressure differential originates therein which may cause the end covers to detadh,Shich covers are conventionally bound to the cartridge walls by means of suitable adhesive or cementing materials. Yet another drawback of these known filtering cartridges is that the filtering septus,which is usually formed by fibre layers,generafly of syntehtic or inorganic type and loosely arranged in such a way as to form the so called felta ,without using any binding niaterial,may originate the so called breaking or grinding susceptible to hinder The filtering action of the filtering septum, in particular as it is desired to obtain a fine filtering of The fluid to be filtered. Thirdly, The outer supporting wall of the filtering cartridge, in order to facilitate the assemblying or said cartridge, is interrupted and provided with outwardly turned edges which form guides for inserting therein a coupling member or tile thus,as Rheas edges are brought together for inserting Thereinto said coupling ember, They can damage the porous sectux and even shear said septum. Yet another drawback is that The end covers of the filtering cartridge are generally provided with a central drawn portion, formed for providing therein the annular seat for receiving said supporting walls and the interposed filtering septum, which drawn portion can cause condensate to build up or collect, which can contaminate in the time The fluid to be filtered and originate growth zones for bacteria, which is greatly deleterious particularly in the case of sterilized filters. Accordingly The Thereinabove mentioned drawbacks act against a broad range of applications of the presently commercially available filtering cartridges and,moreover,against the duration Thereof, thereby These known cartridges are greatly expensive from the use point.of.view. SUMMARY OF TFiE INVENTION he present invention sets out to provide an improved filtering cartridge structure, effective to obviate all of the Thereinabove mentioned drawbacks, while being construction wise simple and effective to be easily assembled. Yet another obJect of the present invention is to provide such a filtering cartridge structure the end cover thereof are not subjected to detaching because of pressure impacts or manual o . achanical tearing, thereby assuring a greater stability of said filtering cartridge even in the case of an anomalous operation of this latter. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a filtering cartridge structure in which the coupling member or tile to the supporting wall is omitted,thereby eliminating any possibilities of damaging the porous septum as the filtering cartridge is assembled. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a filtering cartridge structure which does not present condensate collecting pheno mena,Thereby preventing the fluid to be filtered from being contaminated. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a filtering cartridge structure having an improved tightness with respect to the filter casing therein it will be assembled. The aforesaid and other obiects and advantages or the present invention are achieved by a filtering cartridge for filtering fluids, in particular gaseous fluids, provided with a mouth portion and a bottom portion, characterized in that it comprises a filtering septum formed by a central thin filtering member including three mutually glued layers, the intermediate layer thereof consists of microfibres held together by a binding material and the two outer layers thereof consist of synthetic or the like fibres loosely located and hot sealed together, two continuous septum supporting permeable wIlls, fixing means for mutually fixing eaia mouth and bottom portions, said bottom portion being free of counterdrawn portions in such a way as to prevent condensate from ac cumulating. Preferably the intermediate layer of said filtering member consists of glass microribres held together by a binding material in such a way as to form a fiberglass cushion member and the outer layers of said filtering member consist of polyester resin fibres as loosely arranged and hot sealed and then calendered,said three layers being successive ly firmly glued by lamination. Thus the filtering member forming material is particularly strong, while being effective to provide a greatly efficient filtering action, at least equal to that of the presently colpmercially available filtering means. Preferably the filtering septum comprises two further prefiltering layers, one at each side or said central filtering member. Advantageously the septum permeable supporting walls are obtained by sealing or welding the facing flaps or edges, in such a way as to not present any interruptions during the asssmblying on said filtered ing septum. Thus the danger is eliminated of a shewing of said filtering septum during the adjoining of the flaps or edges to apply the conventional coupling or tile member. Advantageously the fixing means for fixing said mouth and bottom portions oonsist of a central perforated tubular member or pipe effective to held said two portions together by sealing said tubular member or pipe thereto. 2iu8 the danger is eliminated or the detaching of said end members as a pressure surge occurs as due either to the clogging of said porous septum or to any other outside event, either of mechanical or physical nature. Advantageously the bottom portion is provided with a central raised flat circular portion effective to fit or house a sealing gasket, The peripheral surface of said bottom portion being also flattened. Thus the conventional counterdrawn portion is eliminated which would be susceptible to originate a condensate build up which would compromise a good operation of the filtering cartridge. The fluid to be filtered inlet mouth is advantageously provided with one or more gaskets in order to provide a perfect tightness of the filtering cartridge in its housing or seat.
