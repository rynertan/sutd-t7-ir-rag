# Polymeric fat acid polyamide resins for use in flexographic ink vehicles having reduced solvent emissions.

## Abstract
Polymeric fat acid polyamides are disclosed useful in the flexographic ink industry, to provide products which will comply with environmental protection standards. The im provement lies in the use of acid termination with acid values of 8 20 and a sufficient amount of unsaturated monomeric fatty acids to provide a molecular weight product which will permit relatively high solids levels and reduced solvent emis sion while maintaining good ink varnish properties.
