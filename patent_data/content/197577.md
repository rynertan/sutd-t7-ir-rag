# Method of cleaning contaminated soil.

## Abstract
A method of cleaning contaminated soil which achieves very low levels of residual impurities and does not produce contaminated residues is characterised by the steps of a feeding the contaminated soil to a combustion space 6 of a fluidised bed furnace 4 having, at the underside of said combustion space, a structure 5 for air distribution, b forming a fluidized bed of the contaminated soil above said air distribution structure 5 in the combustion space by means of combustion air delivered under elevated pressure via the air distribution structure, and c mainly or completely burning the impurities from the soil in the combustion space 6 , to provide cleaned soil. Preferably the air distribution structure 5 comprises a generally horizontal grid 7 of pipes having air distribution nozzles with gaps between the pipes, coarse soil particles passing through said gaps into a collection space 13 from the combustion space.
