# A process for the preparation of catalysts for use in ether synthesis.

## Abstract
An aluminosilicate catalyst for catalytic dehydration of alcohols into ether comprises the steps of a contacting a crystalline aluminosilicate at below 800 C, preferably 320 800 C, with a nitrogen containing base, preferably ammonia or a lower alkyl amine such as n butyl amine, to absorb as much as possible of the base and b desorbing part of the absorbed base by passing a stream of an inert gas over the thus treated aluminosilicate at a temperature of 320 800 C, preferably 400 600 C. In step a the aluminosilicate catalyst is deacti vated and in step b it is selectively reactivated so that the ca talyst catalyses the ether formation reaction almost as well as the untreated catalyst, whereas the catalytic activity for other reactions such as formation of hydrocarbons and formation of coke consisting of polymerisates and or carbon is elimi nated. Suitable aluminosilicates to be treated according to the invention are zeolites, notably zeolite H ZSM 5 and Y zeolite, and smectites, notably cross linked natural smectites.
