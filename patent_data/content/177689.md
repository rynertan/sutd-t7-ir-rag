## Description
The present invention relates to a process for polymerizing ethylene or copolymerizing ethylene with other α olefin by means of a catalyst comprising a special solid catalyst component containing a titanium compound, and an organometallic compound, whereby a polymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution, a uniform particle size and a high bulk density is obtainable. GB A 2083483 discloses the polymerisation of butene 1 in the presence of a catalytic system comprising a solid catalyst component containig magnesium, halogen and titanium elements, and an organoaluminum compound, has been known as a highly active catalyst for the polymerization of olefins. It has been reported that a polymer obtainable by the polymerization of ethylene or the copolymerization of ethylene with other α olefin by means of this catalyst system, generally has a narrow molecular weight distribution. In the case of a polymer of injection molding grade or extrusion molding grade, the mechanical strength is closely related to the molecular weight distribution of the polymer, and the molecular weight distribution is desired to be as narrow as possible. And, in the case of slurry polymerization, if the polymerization of ethylene or the copolymerization of ethylene with other α olefin is conducted by using this catalyst system, a low molecular weight product soluble in the polymerization solvent forms in a substantial amount, which is likely to cause a deposition on the polymerization reactor during the production. Further, such a low molecular weight product is likely to cause fuming or waxy deposit around die lips during the molding of the polymer. This is distinct particularly when ethylene is copolymerized with other α olefin, and becomes more distinct when the copolymer is made to have a lower density. If such polymerization solvent soluble components are present in a substantial amount, it becomes difficult to remove the polymerization heat during the production of a low density polyethylene or an intermediate density polyethylene. Further, another serious problem is that the monomer used, is not effectively taken into the copolymer, whereby the loss of the monomer increases, and the productivity decreases. Such polymerization solvent soluble components comprise polymers having very low molecular weights and polymers having very low densities. The production of the polymers having very low molecular weights is determined by the molecular weight distribution at the time of the polymerization or copolymerization, and the production of the polymers having very low densities is likewise determined by the density distribution. Accordingly, as a means to reduce the polymerization solvent soluble components, it is conceivable to make the molecular weight distribution of the polymer as narrow as possible. On the other hand, in view of an increasing need for saving the installation and production costs by simplifying the process, it is necessary to improve the catalyst components to increase the catalytic activity per the transition metal and per the solid catalyst component, and make it possible to conduct an efficient continuous operation for a long period of time when a continuous slurry polymerization is carried out by means of such a catalyst. For this purpose, it is necessary to minimize the formation of fine polymer particles and obtain a polymer having a uniform particle size and a high bulk density. The present inventors have conducted various researches on polymerization catalysts, and they have previously developed a method for polymerizing ethylene at a high catalytic activity by using a catalyst comprising an organometallic compound and a solid catalyst component insoluble in an inert hydrocarbon solvent, obtained by reacting a halogen containing titanium or vanadium compound with a reaction product of a specific organosilicon compound with an organomagnesium compound, and have filed patent applications U.S. Patent No. 3,907,759, and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 212210 1982 . According to these methods, the catalyst is highly active, the polymer has a high bulk density, the powder properties are good, and it is possible to conduct a continuous operation on an industrial scale for long period of time at a high slurry concentration. However, for the production of an injection molding grade polymer or an extrusion molding grade polymer, it has been desired to further improve the mechanical strength. Further, in the production of a low or intermediate density polyethylene, the molecular weight distribution is not adequately narrow, and a substantial amount of polymerization solvent soluble components is present, whereby it is likely that the particle properties deteriorate due to the swelling of the polymer. Accordingly, it is a first object of the present invention to provide a process for producing an ethylene polymer or a copolymer of ethylene with other α olefin having a narrow molecular weight distribution, and consequently having excellent mechanical strength and a minimum content of polymerization solvent soluble components, by using a catalyst having a high catalytic activity. A second object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing an ethylene polymer or a copolymer of ethylene with other α olefin having a uniform particle size and a relatively high bulk density in order to make it possible to conduct a continuous operation on a industrial scale for a long period of time. The present invention provides a process for polymerizing or copolymerizing ethylene, characterized in that ethylene or a mixture of ethylene with other α olefin is polymerized in the presence of a catalyst comprising Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. As the hydropolysiloxane to be used for the preparation of the reaction product A in the present invention, there may be mentioned compounds having a structural unit of the following formula I and optional degrees of polymerization, or a mixture of such compounds wherein R⁴ is a monovalent organic group selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group, an aryl group, an aralkyl group, an alkoxy group and an aroxy group, a is 0, 1 or 2, and b is 1, 2 or 3 provided a b 3. They include grease like or wax like hydropolysiloxanes having various polymerization degrees ranging from those being liquid with a low viscosity and low polymerization degree to those having a viscosity of 100,000 centistokes, as well as solid substances. The structure of the terminal groups of the hydropolysiloxane does not substantially affect the catalytic activity, and may accordingly be closed with an optional inert group such as a trialkyl silyl group. As specific examples, there may be mentioned tetramethyl disiloxane, diphenyldisiloxane, trimethyl cyclotrisiloxane, tetramethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, methylhydropolysiloxane, phenylhydropolysiloxane, ethoxyhydropolysiloxane, cyclooctylhydropolysiloxane, and chlorophenyl hydropolysiloxane. Another group of silicon compounds to be used for the preparation of the reaction product A in the present invention, includes silicon compounds in which organic groups and hydroxyl groups are bonded to silicon atoms, such as a silane compound of the formula As the polysiloxane compound corresponding to a condensation product of the compound of the formula II, there may be employed those having a straight chain structure, a branched chain structure or a three dimensional network structure having a siloxane bond of Si O Si. There is no particular restriction with respect to the degree of polymerization, and it may range from the one having a low degree of polymerization having a viscosity at 25 As specific examples of the polysiloxane compound to be used in the present invention, there may be mentioned α,ω dihydroxydimethyl polysiloxane represented by HO Si CH₃ ₂O The silicon compounds of the formulas I and II may be used alone or as a mixture of at least two different kinds for the preparation of the reaction product A in the present invention. Likewise, they may not necessarily be pure so long as a high catalytic efficiency is thereby obtainable. The organomagnesium compound to be used for the preparation of the reaction product A in the present invention, is a compound of the formula The reaction product A to be used in the present invention, may readily be prepared by reacting an organomagnesium compound of the formula III with a hydropolysiloxane of the formula I, or a silicon compound of the formula II or a condensation product thereof, by an optional method. For instance, the reaction of the hydropolysiloxane and the organomagnesium compound reagent may be conducted by gradually adding, under stirring, the hydropolysiloxane to the organomagnesium compound synthesized in a suitable solvent, and after the addition of the entire amount, heating the mixture for a predetermined period of time. This reaction proceeds at room temperature with vigorous generation of heat, but in order to complete the reaction, it is preferred to heat the reaction mixture at a temperature of from 50 to 100 The reaction product A thus obtained, can be used as it is in the form of the reaction mixture, for the reaction with the silicon compound and the titanium compound for the preparation of a solid catalyst component B . However, when an ether derived from the organomagnesium compound is contained in a substantial amount, it is common to remove a part or whole of the solvent from the reaction mixture containing the reaction product A and then dissolve or suspend the reaction product afresh in an inert hydrocarbon solvent before supplying it for the preparation of the reaction product B . The silicon compound to be used for the preparation of the solid catalyst component B in the present invention, is the one represented by the formula Compounds i and ii may be reacted or mixed in an optional ratio to obtain a compound or mixture iii . For the preparation of the catalyst of the present invention, the above compounds i , ii and iii may be employed alone or in combination as a mixture. The titanium compound to be used for the preparation of the solid catalyst component B in the present invention is the one represented by the formula Various methods may be employed to conduct the reaction of the three components, i.e. the reaction product A , the silicon compound and the titanium compound, for the preparation of the solid catalyst component B . There may be mentioned, for instance, 1 a method wherein the reaction product A and the silicon compound or the titanium compound are reacted first, and then the titanium compound or the silicon compound is reacted thereto, 2 a method wherein the silicon compound and the titanium compound are simultaneously added to the reaction product A to conduct the reaction, or 3 a method wherein the reaction product A is added to a mixture of the silicon compound and the titanium compound, to conduct the reaction. Particularly preferred is the method wherein the reaction product A is reacted with the silicon compound, followed by the reaction with the titanium compound, or the method wherein the silicon compound and the titanium compound are preliminarily reacted and then simultaneously added to the reaction product A to conduct the reaction. The above reaction is usually conducted in an inert hydrocarbon solvent. It is particularly preferred to conduct the reaction in the presence of an aromatic or halogenated aromatic solvent such as benzene, toluene, or chlorobenzene. The reaction of the reaction product A with the silicon compound is usually conducted at a temperature of from 0 to 110 Thus, the solid catalyst component B is formed. It is subjected to washing with an inert hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane, heptane or kerosine to remove soluble components from the reaction mixture and to recover the solid catalyst component B . Another component of the catalyst system of the present invention is an organoaluminum compound. As its specific examples, there may be mentioned trimethyl aluminum, triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, diethyl aluminum chloride, dibutyl aluminum chloride, ethyl aluminum sesquichloride, diethyl aluminum hydride, dibutyl aluminum hydride, and diethyl aluminum ethoxide. The catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene to be used in the present invention, can readily be prepared by contacting the above mentioned solid catalyst component B with the above mentioned organoaluminum compound in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, for instance, by charging the two materials into a catalyst preparation vessel or a polymerization reactor in the presence of a solvent and stirring the mixture. A preferred ratio of the two components for the formation of the ethylene polymerization catalyst is from 1 to 1000 g atoms of aluminum per gram atom of titanium in the catalyst. In the present invention, the conditions for the polymerization of ethylene or the copolymerization of ethylen with other α olefin, are the same as the conditions in the case where a common Ziegler type catalyst is employed, and the polymerization or copolymerization can be conducted in either liquid phase inclusive of a slurry method and a solution method wherein the polymerization is conducted at a temperature at which the polymer is in a molten state or vapour phase. Further, the polymerization may be conducted in two steps or more under different reaction conditions. The polymerization in liquid phase can readily be conducted by dispersing the catalyst of the present invention in a suitable inert hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane, heptane or kerosine, and introducing ethylene thereto. The polymerization temperature is preferably from 30 to 200 The molecular weight of the polymer obtainable by the method of the present invention, may optionally be controlled by adjusting e.g. the polymerization temperature and the amount of the catalyst. However, the most effective method for controlling the molecular weight is to add hydrogen to the polymerization system. The polymerization catalyst to be used in the present invention, is useful for the polymerization of ethylene and for the copolymerization of ethylene with other α olefin such as propylene, butene 1, hexene 1 or octene 1. Now, the present invention will be desribed in further detail with reference to Examples and Comparative Examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no means restricted by these specific Examples.

To the slurry thus obtained, n hexane was added, and the soluble components were filtered off. This operation was repeated 6 times, whereupon a solid catalyst component B was obtained. This solid catalyst component contained 15.7 mg of titanium per gram of the solid catalyst component. The supported amount in Table 1 indicates this numerical value. Into a stainless steel autoclave having an internal capacity of 1.6 liters and equipped with a stirrer and a heating and cooling jacket, with its interior dried and substituted with nitrogen, 600 ml of n hexane was charged and heated to 60 99.5 g of white powder polyethylene was obtained.

Into a glass reactor with its interior preliminarily well dried and substituted with nitrogen, 54 ml of α, ω dihydroxydimethylpolysiloxane SiOH content 0.146 mol and 100 ml of toluene were charged, and 50 ml of a tetrahydrofuran solution of n butylmagnesium chloride 0.146 mol of n butylmagnesium chloride was gradually dropwise added under stirring. The reactor was cooled with a cooling medium to compensate the heat generation. After the addition of the entire amount, the reaction mixture was kept at 70 Then, in order to remove excess tetrahydrofuran, 400 ml of toluene was added, and the mixture was heated to distilled off about one half of the liquid phase. The solution thereby obtained was diluted with toluene to obtain 580 ml of a toluene solution having a magnesium concentration of 0.25 mol liter. The solid catalyst component B was obtained in the same manner as in Example 2 b except that 560 ml of the toluene solution of the reaction product A obtained above, was used. The polymerization of ethylene was conducted under the same polymerization conditions as in Example 2, whereby 105.2 g of white powder polyethylene was obtained. The properties of the polyethylene were as shown in Tables. The reaction product A of Example 1 a was combined with various silicon compounds and titanium compounds in various ratios as identified in Table 1 to obtain solid catalyst components B in accordance with the method described in Example 3 b . The subsequent polymerization of ethylene was conducted in the same manner as in Example 3 c . Polymerization of ethylene with butene 1 was conducted for 1 hour by using 8.3 mg of the solid catalyst component B prepared in Example 1 at a polymerization temperature of 70 The particle size distribution was very sharp, and particles having a particle size of less than 100 µm were not substantially present. The catalytic activity was 590 kg g Ti.hr, and 10.6 kg g cat.hr. The polymerization was conducted in the same manner as in Example 16, except that the amount of butene 1 was changed to 40 g, whereby 97.9 g of a white powder copolymer of ethylene with butene 1 was obtained. This copolymer had MI₂ of 0.308, FR of 25.7, and a density of 0.9219. The n hexane soluble components in the copolymerization were 7.0 g. The particle size distribution was very sharp, and particles having a particle size of less than 100 µm were not substantially present. The catalytic activity was 702 kg g Ti.hr and 12.6 kg g cat.hr. A grey solid catalyst component was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 b except that the silicon compound of Example 1 was not added. The titanium content in 1 g of this solid catalyst component was 95 mg. The polymerization was conducted under the same conditions as in Example 1 c except that the polymerization temperature was changed to 80 A solid catalyst component B was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 b except that 0.14 mol of silicon tetrachloride was used as the silicon compound in Example 1 b and 0.14 mol of titanium tetrachloride was used as the titanium compound. Into the same autoclave as used in Example 1 c , 600 ml of n hexane was charged, and heated to 60 The copolymerization of ethylene with butene 1 was conducted in the same manner as in Example 16 except that 2.1 mg of the solid catalyst component as used in Comparative Example 1, was used, whereby 94.6 g of a white powder copolymer of ethylene with butene 1 was obtained. The properties of the copolymer were shown in the following Table. The polymerization solvent soluble contents were 14.8 g. The test results of Examples 1 to 17 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 are shown in Tables 1 to 5. The effects of the catalyst of the present invention may be summarized as follows Examples 1 to 15 are directed to the homopolymerization of ethylene, and Examples 16 and 17 are directed to the copolymerization with butene. The catalytic activities are well qualified as a highly active catalyst from both the data per titanium unit I and the data per catalyst unit II . Examples 16 and 17 and Comparative Example 3 are all directed to the copolymerization. In Comparative Example 3, the polymerization solvent soluble components were produced in an amount at least about twice the amount in Examples 16 and 17, and the copolymer slurry was like rice gruel. The catalyst of the present invention is industrially advantageous also in this respect. As mentioned above, when the molecular weight distributions are compared on the basis of FR, the smaller the value of FR, the narrower the molecular weight distribution. In the case of the homopolymerization of ethylene, FR is from 24 to 26 in Examples 1 to 15, whereas FR is about 42 in Comparative Examples 1 and 2. Thus, the catalyst of the present invention is evidently superior also in respect of the molecular weight distribution. The same is true in the case of the copolymerization of ethylene with butene 1, as is evident from the comparison between Examples 16 to 17 and Comparative Example 3. From the particle size distributions in Examples 1 to 4, it is evident that the formation of fine particles is minimum, and the distribution width as shown by log σ is narrow. The distribution of this degree is suitable for easy handling on an industrial scale. The measured values in Examples 1 to 3 range from 0.300 to 0.345. The method of the present invention meets the industrial requirements also in this respect.
