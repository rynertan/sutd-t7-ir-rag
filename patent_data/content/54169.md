# Safety saw chain.

## Abstract
An improved, endless safety saw chain includes a pair 12 of the side links, one of the side links being a cutter link 20 and the other of the side links being a noncutting link 22 and having a depth gauge 30 in substantial alignment with a depth gauge 28 on the cutter link 20 . A preceding center drive link 18 may include an upward and rearward sloping surface 32 positioned to extend between the depth gauges of the side links. The sloping surface 32 is preferably dimensioned so as to be in substantial alignment with the depth gauges 28 and 30 as the saw chain articulates about the nose of the chain saw bar.
