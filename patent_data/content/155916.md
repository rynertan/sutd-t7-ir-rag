# An accumulating conveyor device.

## Abstract
The present invention is constituted by a device which acts, simultaneously, as an accumulation member for packs of signatures 15 and as a device for conveying these latter to subsequent working stages. The device comprises a structure 20 supporting at least one pair of shafts 1,2 , disposed horizontally and provided each with a pair of sprockets 3,4 5,6 , over which pass special conveyor chains 7,8 constituted by articulated links 9 capable of rotating about articulation pins 10 and some of the pins 10 supporting pairs of pulleys 11,12 , suitably spaced, and disposed on the same side or, alternatively, on opposite sides of the chain itself. The pulleys 11,12 have a diameter such that they project above the links 9 and longitudinally adjacent pairs of pulleys 11,12 carry belts 16 which also project above the chain links 9 to provide a support surface on which the signatures can rest. The chains are driven faster than the required conveying speed and the pulleys can turn individually to allow the packs of signatures to accumulate.
