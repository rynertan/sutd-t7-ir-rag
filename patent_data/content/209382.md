## Description
CAST MOLDING OF ACRYLIC PLASTICS The present invention relates to a method for molding a transparent plastics substrate, and more particularly, to a method for molding a transparent plastics substrate which is used as a substrate for discs e.g., optical discs or magneto optical discs in an optical writing, reading and erasing system. A transparent plastic substrate has an excellent low birefringence which is the basic feature for optical properties, and great attention has recently been paid thereto. A transparent plastics substrate is generally produced by a cast molding method comprising pouring a polymerizable liquid material such as a polyallyl carbonate, a polyolpoly meth acrylate or an epoxy acrylate into a cavity of a mold and radical polymerizing the material in the mold to form a transparent plastics substrate, as disclosed in, for example, published Japanese Patent Applications Nos. 130450 83 and 137150 83. In addition, there are known methods for conducting photopolymerization in a mold constituted by glass plates at both sides Japanese Patent Application No. 202557 85 , a method of thermal polymerization after casting a liquid resin into a mold under vacuum, and a method of thermal polymerization under pressure for a cast liquid resin published Japanese Patent Application No. 203414 85. Conventional cast molding method of the transparent plastics substrate requires about 24 hours from the pouring of a reactive liquid material into the mold used to completion of the molding. Therefore, the efficiency of use of the mold is extremely low, and the number of stampers needed recorded matrix to transfer signals, grooves for trucking and the like is increased. This is a serious problem for the productivity of the making of a transparent plastic substrate. Furthermore, as a method for increasing the efficiency of use of the mold, it is sufficient to shorten the molding time. However, for example, if radical polymerization is completed in the mold by irradiation with light energy,a polyfunctional meth acrylate compound produce a residual strain by its shrinkage during polymerization or curing reaction. In demolding the transparent plastics substrate from a mold made of glass, metal, rubber or the like after the completion of molding, the plastics substrate may be broken or cracked, or the mold is broken. Therefore, it has been desired to overcome these defects. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a practically useful method for molding a plastics substrate which can minimize cracking or breakage of the substrate during radical polymerization and demolding. The present invention provides a method for obtaining a transparent plastics substrate by radical polymerization of a polyfunctional meth acrylate compound by a cast molding method, wherein when the radical polymerisation has proceeded to the stage at which the glass trans ition temperature Tg of the substrate obtained in a mold reaches 10 to 100 DEG C, the substrate is removed from the mold, and the substrate is post cured to obtain a substrate having a Tg of 100 DEG C or more. Optionally, after the substrate has been postcured to a Tg of 100 DEG C or more, the substrate is further post cured at a temperature of 150 DEG C or more to obtain a plastics substrate having a small residual content of double bonds, a low water absorption and thus causing little reduction in the life of a recording film. In the method of the invention, the radical polymerization time in the mold is not more than 2 hours, preferably not more then 1 hour, and usually 0.5 to 1 hour, and the un cured substrate is post cured outside the mold. Therefore, the number of substrates produced per mold can be increased by 20 to 40 times. Further, since the substrate formed under the condition that its glass transition temperature is low is removed from the mold, the rate of breakages of the substrates is low. In the curing step, the plastic substrate obtained is heated at at least 150 DEG C, so that the residual content of double bonds in the final plastics substrate is decreased to 30 or less, and the degree of water absorption of the substrate is decreased. As a result, the effect of increasing optical disc substrate characteristics can be increased. The polyfunctional meth acrylate compound is preferably represented by the formula I EMI4.1 wherein R1 is an alcohol residue having 2 to 50 carbon atoms, R2 is H or CH3, and n is an integer of 2 to 6, and which, when radical polymerized, produces a cured product having a glass transition temperature of 110 DEG C or more. Representative examples of the polyfunctional meth acrylate compound are methacrylic or acrylic acid esters such as 2,2 bis 4 beta methacryloyloxy cyclohexyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 beta methacyloyloxydiethoxy cyclohexyl propane, bis oxymethyl tricyclo 5,2,1,0 2 , 6 decane dimethacrylate, 1,4 bis methacryloyloxymethyl cyclohexane, trimethylolpropanetri meth acrylate, neopentylglycol di meth acrylate, 1,6 hexanediol di meth acrylate, 1,3 butanediol di meth acrylate, diethylene glycol di meth acrylate, and 2,2 bis 4 methacryloyldiethoxy phenylpropane. These compounds are used alone or as mixtures thereof. 2,2 Bis 4 beta methacryloyloxyethoxy cyclohexyl propane, bis oxymethyl tricyclo 5,2,1,0 2 , 6 decane dimethacrylate, and 1,4 bis methacryloyloxymethyl cyclohexane are particularly preferred from the standpoint of optical properties.The term meth acrylate as used herein means both acrylate and methacrylate. In addition to the compounds of the formula I , radical polymerizable monomers conventionally used as viscosity controlling agents can be used in an amount of 10 wt or less. Examples of such polymerizable monomers are vinyl compounds such as styrene, chlorostyrene, dichloro styrene, vinyltoluene, divinylbenzene, vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride meth acryl compounds such as methyl methacrylate, phenyl meth acrylate, benzyl meth acrylate, 2 phenoxyethyl meth acrylate, cyclohexyl meth acrylate, glycidyl meth acrylate, epoxy meth acrylate and urethane meth acrylate allyl compounds such as diethylene glycol bisallylcarbonate and diallyl phthalate. The radical initiator used in polymerization of the monomer is not particularly limited. For example, peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, diisopropyl peroxy carbonate lauryoyl peroxide and tertiary butyl peroxy pivalate, azo compounds such as azoisobutylonitrile, photosensitizers such as benzophenone, benzoin ethyl ether, benzyl, acetophenone and anthraquinone, and sulfur compounds such as diphenyl sulfide and thiocarbamates, which are conventional radical initiators can be used. The above radical polymerization can be carried out under convention radical polymerization conditions e.g., heating, light irradiation or electron beam irradiation . The amount of the radical initiator added is 0.01 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polyfunctional meth acrylate compound. The polymerization temperature is 10 to 200 DEG C and preferably 30 to 150 DEG C. The polymerization can be carried out in an atmosphere of air or inert gas. The transparent plastic substrate obtained by radical polymerizing the above polyfunctional meth acrylate by the cast molding method has the glass transition temperature Tg at the time of removal from the mold of 10 to 100 DEG C and preferably 20 to 80 DEG C. If the Tg were less than 10 DEG C, curing is insufficient and, therefore, the transparent plastic substrate is deformed by the force exerted in removing the substrate from the mold. This is a great problem in obtaining a transparent plastic substrate having substrate performance of, e.g., high surface smoothness. On the other hand, if the Tg were more than 100 DEG C, the cross linking reaction of the polyfunctional meth acrylate compound proceeds partially and the molded product becomes brittle. Therefore, the substrate breaks in the mold due to the residual strain such as cure shrinkage and causes cracking.Moreover, the substrate breaks under the force exerted at the time of removing the substrate from the mold and causes cracking. The plastic substrate removed from the mold is placed on a flat surface and post cured until its Tg reaches 110 DEG C or more. This post curing enables the curing reaction to proceed to the extent that the performance of the substrate is satisfactory, without causing breakage and cracking due to the curing in the mold. The post curing can be carried out by techniques such as heating, irradiation with ultraviolet rays and irradiation with electron beams. The post curing is preferably carried out stepwise with respect to the temperature and irradiation dose. The second post curing temperature is preferably 150 DEG or more. It is also preferred that the final curing is at a temperature of 200 DEG C or more in a vaccum, nitrogen or inert gas atmosphere. In the present method, the un cured plastic substrate is removed from the mold just in the incomplete radical polymerization state wherein the glass transition temperature of the pre cured substrate is 10 to 100 DEG C, so that mechanical residual strain and optical residual stain due to the shrinkage during polymerization can be minimized. By carrying out the post curing after removal from the mold, a difference in mechanical residual strain between the surface and the inside of the substrate, which is due to the shrinkage during polymerisation under the restraint of the mold, can be removed. This post curing is such that the glass transition temperature of the plastic substrate obtained by the polymerization in the mold is 10 to 100 DEG C, and in order to maintain the shape, the temperature cannot be rapidly increased to 150 DEG C.If the post curing temperature is low, the residual content of double bonds is increased. However, by post curing at a temperature of 150 DEG C or more, the radical polymerization of the residual portion of double bonds proceeds, resulting in decrease in the content of double bond in the substrate. The present invention is explained in greater detail by reference to the following Examples and Comparative Examples. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages and parts are by weight. In Examples and Comparative Examples, the glass transition termperature Tg , the residual content of double bond , and the effect on a recording film were measured by the following methods. Glass Transition Temperature Tg Measured with a differential scanning colorimeter DSC Du Pont 990 System at a rate of 10 DEG C min in air. Residual Content of Double Bonds Measured by the IR analytical method A base line is drawn below the peaks of 1560 to 1660 cm 1 and 2600 to 3600 cm 1 . The areas, S1 and S2, of the peaks of 1560 to 1660 cm 1 and 2600 to 3600 cm 1 are measured, and n is determined by the equation n S1 S2. With n of a liquid resin as 100 and n at Si 0 as 0 , a calibration line is determined. Each sample is measured for n, and is calculated from the calibration line. Effect on Recording Layer Examination of appearance after soaking in water. The Figure in the drawing is a diagrammatic vertical section showing apparatus used for examining the relationship between the deterioration of a recording film and the degree of water absorption of a synthetic resin substrate. As shown in the drawing, a recording layer 2 is formed on a substrate 1 by sputtering, and sealed with a quartz plate 3 and a periferal p.t.f.e. spacer 4 and a paraffin wax seal 5 and clamped together with a spring clamp 6. The assembly is submerged in a thermostatic bath 7 filled with pure water 8. When the state of saturated water absoption of the substrate expressed as percentage increase in the weight of the substrate is reached, the sample is taken out and the number of pinholes in the recording layer was determined with a microscope. EXAMPLE 1 0.5 part of benzoyl peroxide was added to 100 parts of 2,2 bis 4 beta methacryloyloxyethoxy cyclohexyl propane to prepare a liquid polymerisable mixture. This mixture was heated to 60 DEG C, uniformly stirred and mixed, defoamed, poured into the cavity of a mold constituted by a glass plate having a diameter of 120 mm, a silicone rubber ring and a metal stamper, and cured at a polymerization temperature of 80 DEG C. After 30 minutes, the cured product was removed from the mold this operation was conducted easily. A crack and defect free plastic disc substrate was obtained. The Tg of the disc substrate was 38 DEG C. The substrate was placed on a flat plate and post cured at 80 DEG C, and a transparent plastic disc substrate having good properties of transferring a stamper signal was obtained. The substrate had no defect, i.e., its appearance was good and it had no warp. The residual content of double bonds in the substrate post cured at 150 DEG C for 2 hours was 28 , and the degree of saturated water absorption was 1.3 .

EXAMPLE 3 A polymerizable solution prepared by adding 0.5 part of benzoyl peroxide to 60 parts of 2,2 bis 4 beta methacryloyloxy cyclohexyl propane and 40 parts of trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate was subjected to the pre curing in the same manner as in Example 1. After 35 minutes, the cured product was removed from the mold. This operation could be carried out easily. A crack and defect free plastic disc substrate was obtained. The Tg of the plastic disc substrate was 25 DEG C. The substrate was placed on a flat plate and post cured at 80 DEG C, and a plastic disc substrate having the final Tg of 168 DEG C and good transferring properties of a stamper signal was obtained. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 0.5 Part of benzoyl peroxide was added to 100 parts of 2,2 bis 4 beta methacryloyloxyethoxy cyclohexyl propane to prepare a polymerizable solution. This solution was subjected to the pre curing polymerization temperature 80 DEG C time 4 hours in a mold in the same manner as in Example 1. The cured product was removed from the mold. The curing reaction in the mold proceeded only partially, and the cured product was brittle. During the operation, the plastic disc substrate was cracked. The Tg of the plastic disc substrate was 132 DEG C. EXAMPLE 4 To 100 parts of 2,2 bis 4 beta methacryloyloxyethoxy cyclohexyl propane were added 0.5 part of a photosensitizer Irgacure TM 651, produced by Ciba Geigy AG and 0.5 part of benzoyl peroxide. The resulting mixture was heated to 60 DEG C, uniformly stirred and mixed, and defoamed. This liquid was poured into a cavity of a mold constituted by a glass plate having a diameter of 120 mm, a silicone rubber and a metal stamper, and irradiated with ultraviolet rays by passing 20 times under a 80 W cm UV lamp. The cured product was then removed from the mold to obtain a crack and defect free plastic disc substrate. The Tg of this substrate was 25 DEG C. The Tg of the substrate post cured at 80 DEG C for 2 hours was 148 DEG C, and the residual content of double bonds was 38 . The substrate prior to post curing was post cured at 150 DEG C for 2 hours. The residual content of double bonds was the substrate thus post cured was 32 , and the degree of saturated water absorption of the substrate was 1.6 . EXAMPLE 5 A crack and defect free plastic disc substrate was obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 except that bis oxymethyl tricyclo 5,2,1,0 2 , 6 decane dimethacrylate was used in place of 2,2 bis 4 beta methacryloyloxyethoxy cyclohexyl propane. The Tg of the plastic disc substrate was 38 DEG C. The substrate was placed on a flat plate and post cured at 100 DEG C to obtain a plastic disc substrate having the final Tg of 251 DEG C and good transferring properties of stamper signal. This substrate was post cured at 150 DEG C for 2 hours. The residual content of double bond in the substrate thus obtained was 28 . This substrate was further post cured at 200 DEG C for 2 hours. The residual content of double bond in the substrate thus obtained was 17 . This substrate was additionally post cured in N2 at 300 DEG C for 2 hours. The residual content of double bond in the substrate thus obtained was 8 . Each substrate was measured for the degree of water absorption and its effect on a recording layer thereon. The results obtained are shown in the Table below. EMI13.1 COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 The procedure of Example 4 was repeated except that the post curing was carried out only by irradiation with ultraviolet rays. Even after 50 UV lamp passages, the Tg was 120 DEG C and did not reach to the final Tg of 148 DEG C of Example 4. The residual content of double bonds was about 43 to 45 .
