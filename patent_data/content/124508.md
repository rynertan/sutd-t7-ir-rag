# SPARK CONTROL APPARATUS

## Abstract
A spark control apparatus 1 for an internal combustion engine using a breaker point 3 or solid state 5 ignition to control current to an ignition coil 11 . The waveform of the ignition signal from the ignition system is applied to a conver ter section 35 of the apparatus to convert the signal waveform to a predetermined waveform. A sensor 25 sen ses engine vibration and generate a representative electri cal signal which a signal processor 41 processes to deter mine engine knock by comparing the peak and average val ues of the signal. A delay circuit 45 delays termination of current to the ignition coil and thus the ignition timing as a function of the comparison of the peak and average values of the control signal. When there is no knock, the timing slowly returns to normal. A driver 50 responds to current signals to control current to the ignition coil. The driver is shut off when the engine is not running to reduce current drain. A first transistor Q12 switches on and off when the engine is run ning and is off when the engine is not running. A second transistor Q13 turns off the driver when the transistor is on. A controller Q17, C14, R48 and R49 controls this transistor to turn it on when the engine is not running. The controller responds to changes in operating states of the first transistor to switch the operating state of the second transistor.
