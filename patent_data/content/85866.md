## Description
Derivatives of benso 1,2 thiazine 1,1 dioxide, a process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing the sameThe present invention refers to new derivatives of benzo 1,2 thiaxine l,l dioxide of gene ral formula EMI1.1 where R stands for lower alkyl C1 C4 R1 stands for a linear or a branched alkyl bearing from 1 to 5 atoms of carbon and preferably ter butyl Ar stands for an aromatic or heteroaromatic residue bearing from 1 to 3 etheroatoms such as C, S, N, and preferably the resi dues 2 pyridyl, 2 thiazolyl and their addition salts with pharmaceutically accepta ble acids.Specific compounds included in the formula T are 4 pivaloyloxy 2 methyl 2H 1,2 benzothiazine 3 N 2 pyridyl carboxamide 1,1 dioxide 4 py valoiloxy 2 methyl 2H 1,2 benzothiazine 3 N 2 thiazolyl carboxamide 1,1 dioxide. In the U.S. Patent n. 3,591,584 a new class of compounds of the series of the 3 aminocarbo nyl 1 ,2 benzothiazine 1 , 1 dioxide bearing hete rocyclic residues at the amino nitrogen has been reported for the first time.Compounds of this kind are endowed with an anal gesic and antiinflammatory activity, and some of them have been used in the therapy of arthrorheumatic affections, in spite of presenting draw backs especially due to the appearance of gastro enteric disorders in the treated patients disorders, however, very common in other non steroidic antiinflammatory compounds.After our priority filing of the present patent application Italian Application n. 19486 A 82 of February 5, 1982 we have learned from the pu blication of the European Application n. 57059, filed on January 11, 1982, that also some esters of 4 hydroxy 2 methyl 2H 1,2 benzothiazine 3 N 2 pyridyl carboxamidS 1,1 dioxide have been prepared and pharmacologically tested.These new derivatives, nevertheless, do not pre sent any real therapeutical advantage, since they possess, to a lower or a higher extent, the same characteristics as the startin,r compound they simply turn out to be more suitable to the topic administration route.It has instead been found, and it is the ob ject of the present invention, that the esterifica tion of the hydroxyl in position 4 in the struc ture in question with a particular kind of such stituent allows to obtain a new compound with antiinflammatory activity that presents unforeseeable surprising advantages at therapeutic le vel.It has in fact been established that only this particular new derivative corresponding to the formula I , precisely obtained by means of este rification of the hydroxyl in 4 position with a ter butyl radical, while it keeps substantially unaltered the anti inflammatory activity, it has a drastically reduced ulcerogenic activity, thus showing a therapeutic index 10.25 times higher than the one of the starting compound.Various ways of synthesis followed to obtain the compounds described in the above mentioned patents and other similar compounds are known from the prior art. One of these ways can be schematized as follows EMI3.1 where R and R represent for example CH3, whereas R represents for example H, alkyl, hetero aromatic residue see U.S. pat. n. 3,591,584, 1971 Lombardino J.G. et al., J. Med. Chem. 14 12 , 1171, 1971.Other alternative ways of synthesis described in patents and in the literature have not offered up to now particular advantages as compared to one indicated above.It has now been found, and it is the object of the present invention, a new method to prepare the compounds of formula I , which presents so me interesting advantages.According to the invention, the compounds I are obtained in conformity to the following reac tion scheme, where R, R1 and Ar have the meaning above specified for the formula I , whereas X and X1 are halogens, for example Cl or Br. EMI5.1 As it is evident, the main characteristic of the new process of synthesis of the invention is the fact of obtaining, from a pentaatomic derivative, an esaatomic ring already substituted in 3 position with the N eterocyclic carboxamidic group.This involves a remarkable increase of the yields.The general synthesis scheme is afterwards explai ned in a more detailed way.The starting products VI and VII are commercially available or they can be prepared according to well known methods.As a matter of fact the compound VII can be ob tained by neutralizing exactly with mineral acids the sodium salt VI dissolved in water, filtering, if necessary,the unreacted product, acidifying at pH 1 0 and filtering VII.The intermediate VII is subsequently reacted with the compound X CH2CONMAr VIII . This reagent is often commercially available, or its synthesis is well hlorm or it is easily obtainable according to well known methods.The reaction between the intermediate VII and the product VIII is carried out at temperatures ranging from 0 and 80oC, preferably from room tem perature to the boiling temperature ci the sol vent that is used, and, if necessary, in the presence of a stoichiometric or catalytic quantity of a base and or of an acidity acceptor B , such as aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic tertiary amines, hydroxydes or carbonates of alkali or earth alkali metals, bicarbonate, acetates, hydrides, amides or alcoxides of alkali metals.As solvents S all the ones that are commonly used, such as benzene, toluene, acetone, chloro form, 1 , 2 dichloro ethane, dimethylformamide, wa ter, methylene chloride, etc. can be used, It is also possible to carry out the reaction in double phase using water and one of the abovementioned solvents. In some cases the solvent can be represented by the reagent itself used in excess.The reaction may be carried out in presence of a catalyst C , such as, for instance, a base like the ones described under B , quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts especially in the double phase reactions , alkali iodides, or cuprous iodide, etc,The expansion reaction of the thiazolic ring ta kes place by means of treatment of the interme diate IX with sodium methoxide in dimethylsulfoxide and by checking the exothermia of the reaction so that the temperature is not higher than 30 350C, The intermediate X thus obtained is transfor med at a temperature that is lower than 50C in one of its addition salts with mineral acids HX1 preferably HCl , by addition of the acid or of one of its solutions in solvent to a so lution of the intermediate X in a solvent that allows the precipitation of the previously formed salt. The intermediate XI is reacted with an acyl halide R1COX or with the anhydride of a caboxylic acid R1CO 2O in a solvent that can be chosen among the ones described before S with the exception of water and at temperatures ranging from 0 to 700C. Also a catalyst C can be used, but more often this is superfluous,When the reaction is over the intermediate XII is isolated, and it is immediately transformed in the compound XIII by means of treatment with a stoichiometric quantity of a base B and or in the presence of a solvent S . The intermediate XIII is finally reacted with the reagent RX in the presence of bases B in the absence or in the presence of solvents S and of catalysts C , at temperatures ranging from 0 to 1OCOC, preferably at room temperature.For this reaction it is possible to use, as solvents, lower alcohols, from which it is possible to crystallize the final product I .The product of the general formula I can be prepared alternatively starting from the intermediate X , by means of the following reactions EMI9.1 where R, R1 and Ar have the meanings that have been previously defined for the general formula I R2 stands for a lower alkyl X stands for an halogen such as Cl, Br B, S, C have the meanings indicate above.The intermediate X is reacted with RX in the presence of a base 3, in the absence or in the presence of the solvent S and of the catalyst C, at tempe ratures ranging from 0 to 100oC, preferably at room temperature. The intermediate XIV that has been thus obtained is reacted with reagents such asEMI9.2 acyl halides orEMI9.3 carboxylic acids anhydrides or R1 COOH carboxylic acids or R1COOR2 esters of carboxylic acids , whereR2, R1 and X have the same meanings they had before. The base B, the solvent S and the catalyst C are of the above mentioned kind. Also acid catalysts are suitable for example mineral acids such as sulphuric, phosphoric and hydroch loric acid .The reaction is carried out between 0 1000C, more often between room temperature and 600C or at the boiling temperature of the sol vent.The final product of the general formula I is crystallized from solvents such as alcohols, ethers, methylene chloride, acetone etc., or from their mixtures.The compounds of formula I thus obtained can moreover form addition salts with various pharma ceutically acceptable acids such as inorganic acids like hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, pho sphoric acid, nitric acid, hydrobromic acid, or organic acids such as oxalic acid, maleic acid, fu maric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid.These salts can be easily prepared in a wellknown way, for example by adding an aequimolecular quantity or an excess of the acid to a so lution of the compound of formula I in an or ganic solvent, such as methanol, ethanol, isopro panol, acetone and similar. The invention is ex plained in a more detailed way by the following examples, which, on the other hand, do not limi tate it.EXAMPLE 1 a Preparation of intermediate VII In a 500 ml beaker provided with magnetic stirrer 0.06 moles of intermediate VI, which are dissolved in about 200 ml of H20, are charged.When the dissolution is complete, 1 N hydrochlo ric acid is slowly added to exact neutrality checking by means of indicator or pH meter .The reaction mixture is now left under stirring for about 30 and the solid formed, if any, is filtered off.The filtrate is acidified to pH 1 0.The precipitated VII is filtered, washed with H2 0 and dried in oven under vacuum.

The reaction mixture is thereafter stirred for 30 at 0 5 C allowing then the temperature to raise in about 90 to 20 C, and then heated in about 60 to 60 70 C. During this heating there is development of HCl continuing again for about 3 hours. At the end the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and the product obtained is filtered Zintermediate XII . The intermediate XII is suspended in about 2QO ml of H2O and the suspension is then brought to pH 7.3 with 10 KOH, keeping the temperature cool and under fast stirring.The suspension is stirred for about two hours and then the product obtained is filtered Zintermediate XIII which can be re crystallized from isopropa nole and characterized by means of N.M.R., I.R.spectra and of elementary analysis.

The reaction mixture is stir red for 15 , then 120 ml of 1 N NaOH are added and the mixture is again stirred for 20 at room temperature 0.38 moles of the alkyl halide RX are then charged, dropping in about 25 . The reaction is allowed to proceed for 18 hours at room temperature, the precipitate formed is filtered, wa shed with H2 0 and finally dried. Yields are 65 90 . The product is characterized by means ofN.M.R., I.R. spectra and of elementary analysis.EXAMPLE 2 a Preparation fof the intermediate XIV from the intermediate X The reaction is carried out in completely analogous conditions to those described in point e ofExample 1.Yields are 45 80 . The product obtained having formula XIV is charac terized by means of N.M.R., I.R. spectra and elementary analysis.b Preapration of final compound IIn a 1000 ml flask provided with stirrer, thermome ter, reflux condenser, dropping funnel and external thermostatic bath, 0.133 moles of the intermediate XIV , 300 ml of anhydrous 1, 2 di chloroethane and 6.9 g of triethylamine are charged, the mixture is then heated to 500C and a solution of acyl halide R1COX 0.099 moles di luted in 15 ml of dichloroethane is dropped 20 . A slight exothermia is noticed during the addition, at the end of which stirring is continued for 20 at 50 C. 6.8 g of triethylamine are then charged and stirring is continued again for 15 at 50 C, thereafter a solution of the acyl halide R1COX 0.099 moles in 15 ml of 1,2 dich loroethane is dropped in about 20 .At the end of this second dropping, the tempera ture is still kept for 20 at 500C, the reaction mixture is then left to cool at 300C and filtered in order to remove the solid formed triethylamine hydrochloride .The filtrate is washed with 2x200 ml of H20, then with 2 x 200 ml of 0.5 N NaOH and finally with H20 to neutrality. The solution in 1,2 dichlcroethane is dried on Na2SO4, the solvent is then evaporated under vacuum till the obtaining of an oil which immediately solidifies and which is well plS ped in ethyl ether. The suspension is filtered, washed with ethyl ether and the solid obtained, which does not require re crystallization, is dried. Yields are 75 90g0. The products are cha racterized by means of N.M.R., I.R. spectra and of elementary analysis.

Acute toxicityThe toxicity by single administration has been determined by oral route in male mice IVA N SPF , fasting, with water ad libitum 18 hours before the experiment. The substances under exam were suspended in 1 carboxymethylcellulose. The results relative to the approximate LD50 values, determined by interpolation on Probitpaper, have been reported in Table I.

Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 111, 544, 1962 .The volume of the treated paw has been measured by means of a water mercury pletismometer according to Leuce P., Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. 136, 237, 1962 immediately before and at different ti mes adter injection of the phlogogenic agent0The results have been expressed as ED30 values calculated on the logarithmic regression straight lines of the percent dose inhibition of the oedema development, in turn determined from the ratio between the mean AUG value area under the curve representing the development of the paw volume in the time in the different treated animals groups and the respective control groups.Such results are shown in the Table II.Gastrolesive activityOn the same animals on which the antiinflammatory activity has been determined, the gastrolesivity has been contemporaneously checked through macroscopic control of the gastric mucosa at a di stance of 7 hours from the administration of the substance under examination.For each treatment, the logarithmic regression straight lines of the dose mm of ulceration single values of each animal have been determi ned. On the ground of such lines the calculation of U33 values, that is a dose whereby a gastric lesion of the total extension of 3 mm is expected, has been performed.The results obtained are shown in Figure II. From the examination of the results, altogether represented in the table I and II the following considerations can be found. The compound CHF 1021 endowed with remarkable antiinflammatory activity, comparable to the one of the reference compound piroxicam surprisingly exhibits an ulcerogenic activity at least 10 times lower and an acute toxi city about 35 lower in comparison to the reference compound.These properties of important antiinflammatory ac tivity with considerable decrease of the ulceroge nic effect, constituting the most serious side ef fect of non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, con fer to the product in question a very remarkable therapeutic interest and they turn out so much un expected if compared with the results obtained with the other analogous derivatives contemporaneously tested.In fact the compound CHF 1047 or pivalic ester of 4 hy droxy 2 methyl 2H 1,2 benzothiazine 3 N 2 thia zolyl carboxamid2 1,1 dioxide sudoxicam presented a very low antiinflammatory activity.His direct parent compound, sudoxicam, on the con trary, had explicated in analogous tests an antiin flammatory activity comparable to the one of piroxicam, our reference drug Wiseman E.H., Lombardi no J.G. Oxicams A novel family of Non Stercidal Anti inflammatory Drugs Eur. J. Rheumatol.

The potency ratios ratios between ED50 values calculated on molar basis point out that CHF 1021 is 1.52 0.49 0.72 0.71 times as active as the reference compound on the plantar oedema by nystatin in the rat, on the erythema by U.V. in the guinea pig, on the writhing test by phenylquinone in the mouse and on the fever by beer s yeast in the reat. The two compounds are almost equally active on the arthri tis by adjuvant in the rat. Preliminar clinical data allowed to point out that CHE 1021 confirms to be a valid antiinflammatory drug practically equally active in comparison with piroxicam but with a clearly lower incidence of side effects about 1 3 than that of the reference drug .The present mvention refers moreover to pharmaceutical compositions containing as the active princi ple a compound of formula I , as defined above, as such or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, in association with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.The compositions can be administered orally, paren terally or topically, in the form respectively of capsules, tablets or similar compositions, supposi tories, vials, cream or gel.For the preparation of the pharmaceutical formula tion for the oral administration in unitary dose, the active principle can be mixed with a solid pow dered, excipient, such as for instance lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, potato or cereal or maize starch, or amylopectin, a derivative of cellulose or gelatin, and it can moreover contain lu bricant such as talcum, polyethylenglyccle or silica, magnesium or calcium stearate,The tablets can be variously coated according to well known methods in the pharmaceutical art.Capsules of hard gelatin can contain granulates of the active principle together with solid powdered excipients, such as lactose, saccharose, sorbi tol, mannitol, starches of the kind indicated abo ve , cellulose or gelatin derivatives, and they may also contain stearic acid or magnesium stearate or talcum.Unitary doses for rectal administration may be in the form of suppositories containing the active principle in association with a neutral fat base example glycerides of fat acids or with water soluble or autoemulsifiable eipients example polyethylenglycole mixtures .For injectable compositions for parenteral admi nistration, the excipients can be a pharmaceuti cally acceptable sterile liquid such as water or an aqueous solution of polyvinylpyrrolydone or, again, an oil such as, for instance, peanutoil and, if necessary a stabilizing agent and or a buffer.The active principle can be dissolved in the li quid and sterilized on filter before being put in a vial or it can be suitably lyophilized in this case vials of liquid for injections will be added in the packagings in order to reconsti tute the solution before use.In the case both of the composition in suppositories and in vials a local anaesthetic, if necessary, can be added to the excipients,The unitary dose for the formiations described above can vary from 10 to 200 mg of active principle and the daily administration will be preferably single.For the preparation of formulations for topic use, fat base excipients, such as vaseline, pa raffin oil, lanoline etc. can be used, as well as autoermilsifiable excipients such as alcohols, fats, polyethylenglycoles, ethers or esters of fat acids or other tensides emulsified in water in the case of unguents, ointments and creams. On the contrary, in the case of preparations of gel of hydrophylic colloids, polymers of different kinds will be used, such as carboxyvynylpolymers, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methylcellulose, Methocel gelatinized in water, ethanol, propylenglycol, glycerole, polyethylenglycols, etc.The topic preparations indicated above can be advantageously added to suitable antibacterial agents, such as parabens, phenol derivatives quaternary ammonium salts, etc.The concentration of the active principle can vary in these compositions from 1 to 10 .We report some formulations as exemplification.
