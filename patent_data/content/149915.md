# STARCH UTILIZATION BY GRAM NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS

## Abstract
A gram negative microorganism is described containing a stable alpha amylase gene from a gram positive microor ganism which codes for an endo amylase which permits the fermentation of said gram negative microorganism in a suspension culture wherein a high molecular weight poly saccharide is the principal carbon source. Growth of such microorganisms in the presence of starch as carbon source permits the production of bacterial polymers and metabo lites such as enzymes or amino acids.
