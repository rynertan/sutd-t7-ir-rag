# Derivatives of Alpha alkyl polyolefinic compounds useful in the treatment of psoriasis.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to novel alpha alkyl polyolefinic compounds and to pharmaceuticals containing said compounds. The pharmaceuticals are useful for the treatment of psoriasis. The alpha alkyl polyolefinic compounds have the structure CHEM wherein n is 0 to 3 R1 to R4 are each independently hydrogen or an alkyl group of from 1 to 5 carbon atoms R2 is an alkyl group of from 1 to 5 carbon atoms R3 is H, C1 C5 alkyl, cyclo C3 C7 alkyl, C2 C5 alkenyl, cyclo C3 C7 alkenyl, aryl, hydroxy, C1 C5 alkoxy, aryloxy, arylalkoxy, formyl, C1 C6 alkylcarbonyl, C2 C5 alkenylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, aryl C1 C5 alkylcarbonyl, aryl C2 C5 alkenylcarbonyl, NR5R5, SR5, O R5, retinyloxy, retinoyl, retinoyloxy, or CHEM R5 is H, C1 C20 alkyl, aryl, aralkyl and Z is a cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or cycloalkadienyl group substituted with from 0 to 5 alkyl groups, a keto group or a hydroxyl group, or a phenyl group substituted with from 0 to 4 hydroxy, alkoxy, alkyl or trifluoromethyl groups or halogen atoms or combinations thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
