# Method for improving specific xanthan productivity during continuous fermentation.

## Abstract
In the production of xanthan gum by the action of Xanthomonas bacteria on a nutrient medium, the specific productivity of the organism employed can be improved by the increase in average cell concentration through the stepwise increase of growth limiting nutrients in the medium.
