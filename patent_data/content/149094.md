# Recording system for time compressed ECG waveforms.

## Abstract
A method of printing an analog waveform having a time variable, such as an ECG by first converting the analog waveform into a time sequence of digitally expressed values, forming predetermined groups of digital data and then determining maximum and minimum amplitude values of the digital data within the groups. These values are stored in a line buffer memory. A recording medium advances past a transversely oriented a linear array of discrete recording elements, such as linear array dot printhead. The serial stored values are read out in parallel to each of the recording elements. with the elements actuated in parallel by the stored values at an initial time and for time durations for each element that is a function of the stored maximum and minimum amplitude values for that element. The waveform is recorded as a series of appropriately placed short parallel longitudinal lines to form in aggregate a transverse wave form display on the recording medium.
