# Liquid dispensing device.

## Abstract
There is disclosed in Figures 1 to 6 a device for pressure dispensing a liquid from a vessel 1 storing the liquid. comprising a tubular fitting member 4 fitted to a mouth 2 of the vessel 1 , a dispensing pipe 26 mounted in the fitting member 4 , a bomb attachment 6 communicat ing with the fitting member 4 and holding therein a bomb 5 filled with pressurised fluid, a bomb unstoppering needle 10 fitted with a terminal sealing member 11 therearround and mounted within the bomb attachment 6 so as to be intruded into and receded out of a sealing plate 5A of the bomb 5 held within the bomb attachment 6 , a supporting member 9 for linearly movably supporting the unstopper ing needle 10 within the bomb attachment, and a device 19 mounted rotatably in the bomb attachment and adapted for shifting the bomb attachment needle 10 . The acute foremost part of the needle 10 which projects beyond the sealing member 11 pierces through the bomb sealing plate 5A to form a discharge orifice 5a in the sealing plate for discharging the pressurised fluid from the bomb 5 and into the vessel, thereby causing pressure dispensing of the liquid in the vessel 1 through the dispensing pipe 26 . As shown in Figures 12 to 19, the dispensing device may also be provided with a valving member 121 adapted to open or close a pressurising fluid vent 120 in timing with the operation of the needle shifting device 114 in such a manner that the pressurising gas previously introduced into the vessel is discharged at the same time as the bomb 108 is closed by the needle 110 .
