The radiation source was a high intensity, copper target, X ray tube operated at 50 Kv and 40 ma. The diffraction pattern from the copper K alpha radiation and graphite monocriroinator is suitably recorded by an X ray spectrometer scintillation counter, pulse height analyzer and strip chart recorder.Flat compressed powder samples are scanned at 2 2 theta per minute, using a two second time constant.Interplanar spacings d are obtained from the position of the diffraction peaks, expressed at 2 where 8 is the Bragg angle, as observed on the strip chart. Intensities are determined from the heights of diffraction peaks after subtracting background.The intensity of the strongest line is designated Io, and is used to determine the relative intensity values by substitution into the formula 100 X 1 leo where I is the intensity of each line other than the strongest line. In some instances the numerical values obtained using the formula are reported in terms of the notations vs, 5, m, w and vw which represent very strong, strong, medium, weak and very weak, respectively. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the determination of the parameter 2 theta is subject to both human and mechanical error, which in combination, can impose an uncertainty of about 0.40 on each reported value of 2 theta. This uncertainty is, of course, also manifested in the reported values of the d spacings in terms of angstrom units, which are calculated from the 2 theta values. This imprecision is general throughout the art and is not sufficient to preclude the differentiation of the present crystalline materials from each other and from the compositions of the prior art. The FeSO 35 compositions of this invention consist structurally of a three dimensional network of SiO2, FeO2 and optionally A102 tetrahedra. In the as synthesized form, electrical neutrality is provided by charge balancing cations which are associated with the FeO2 and A1o2 tetrahedra of the framework structure.Alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, and organic cations derived from the organic templating agent can all be present in the as synthesized form ofFeSO 35 by virtue of being present in the synthesis reaction mixture. Also the organic templating compound can merely be occluded in the pore system of the crystal structure, i.e., not bonded to the crystal lattice, but as an adsorbed or encapsulated phase. Both types of organic constituents are possible in the same structure. The maximum quantity of organic species present is dependent upon tne molecular dimensions of the organic molecule or ion and its configuration.In those cases where a cation derived from the organic templating agent has a larger kinetic diameter than the effective pore diameter of the FeSO 35, or occupies a lattice position not accessible to the major pore system, such organic cation is not considered to be ion excnangeaDle in the ordinary sense. Such cations can, for the most part, however, be thermally decomposed to form ion exchangeable ammonium or hydrogen cations by calcination in air at temperatures of from 2000C to 7000C. The bulk of the non organic cations are ion exchangeable after access to the inner structure of the FeSO 35 crystals is achieved by substantial removal of pore blocking organic species, and thus can be replaced by other metal cations as well asNH4 and R cat ions. Conventional ion exchange procedures are applicable.Activation, i.e., dehydration, to remove adsorbed water from the crystals is readily accomplished even at root temperatures if carried out in a vacuum, but calcination in air at elevated temperatures of up to fDOOC is generally more convenient and is preferred for that reason. The FeSO 35 compositions are generally calcined at a temperature in the range of from 3500C up to tne crystal destruction temperature of the ferrosilicate. Although much remains to be learned about the manner in which templating agents influence the crystallization mecnanism, it does appear that molecular size and configuration are important factors. It has been discovered that methylquinuclidine serves well as a templating agent in tne formation of FeSO 35 materials and hence is preferred. It is contemplated that other organic including organometallic compounds will be suitable for the purpose, particularly among the group containing an element of Group VA of thePeriodic Classification of the Elements N, P, As,Sb, and Bi , preferably nitrogen or phosphorus, containing at least one alkyl or aryl radical having between 1 and 7 carbon atoms. Quaternary ammonium compounds and amines are believed to be employable herein. Mixtures of suitable templating agents are also effective in producing FeSO 35 compositions. FeSO 35can be prepared from a reaction mixture having a composition in terms of mole ratios of oxides within the following ranges 0 10 R2O 1 15 M2 nO AlxFe l x 2O3 10 200 SiO2 200 1000 H O wherein R represents an organic templating agent, preferably an alkyl quinuclidine, amine or quaternary ammonium compound, M represents an alkali or alkaline earth metal having the valence n , and 1x1 bas a value of from zero to 0.98.Preferably the mole ratios of oxides in the reaction mixture are 1 5 R2O 4 12 M2 nO AlxFe l x 2O3 20 80 SiO2 400 600 E o and Xw represents one or a mixture of two or more of sodium, potassium and calcium. More preferably, the reaction mixture comprises a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides comprising 1 5 R2O 4 lO M2 nO AlxFe l x 2O3 20 80 SiO2 400 600 B o Most preferably the reaction mixture contains essentially no aluminum other than that which may be present as an impurity in the reagents which provide the other oxide constituents, wherein xw has a value of from zero to 0.5. It will be understood, however, the FeSO 35 may be formed by the addition of seed crystals of a levynite type crystal structure to the reaction mixture to expedite crystallization and such a seeding process is a part of a preferred synthesis procedure. Of course, the use of previously prepared FeSO 35 compositions as the seed crystals can greatly reduce the amount of aluminum imparted to the reaction mixture as a consequence of such aseeding procedure. When FeSO 35 is prepared by the use of seed crystals, preferably seed crystals in an amount of at least 0.001, and more preferably at least 0.1 up to 10 based on the solid oxide weight of the other constituents of the reaction mixture, are employed. In preparing the reaction mixture, the conventional reactants used in zeolite synthesis are, in general, suitably employed. Iron can be imparted as salts such as FeC13, Fe NO3 3, iron acetate, iron oxyhydroxide, sodium ferrate and the like. Sources of silica include any reactive form of amorphous silica such as silica gel, precipitated silica, fumed silica, silica sol, silica aerogel and also alkali metal silicates. If aluminum is intentionally added, it can be in the form of alpha alumina, gamma alumina, sodium aluminate, aluminum alkoxide, alumina trihydrate, boehmite and the like. The alkali metal and or alkaline earth metals are preferably added as tne hydroxide, but water soluble salts of the metals can be used. The organic templating agent, R, has been described hereinabove. The reaction can be carried out under static or stirred conditions, at a temperature in the range of 1000C to 2500C and under autogenous pressure in a sealed reactor. The reactor is preferably lined with an inert plastic material such as polytetrafluoroethylene. Although it has not been clearly established, it is believed that FeSO 35 is structurally related to the mineral zeolite levynite even though it differs substantially in chemical composition by virtue of the presence of tetrahedralFeO2 c structural units. The composition is found to have a hydrophilic adsorptive nature and to exhibit a substantial acidity of the type useful in the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons.Accordingly, it is useful both as an adsorbent and a catalyst or catalyst base in the same applications heretofore utilizing zeolites generally and small pore zeolites specifically.Example 1 a A reaction mixture was prepared by combining 13.9 grams of iron nitrate nonahydrate Fe NO3 3 . 982O with 50.4 grams of aqueous methylquinuclidine new , 49 wtZ MeQ , and 95.3 grams of Ludox LS an aqueous silica sol 30 wt. SiO2 . The mixture was well mixed. To this mixture was further added a solution of 11.0 grams of sodium hydroxide NaOH in 24.9 grams of water and the mixture stirred until homogenous. The composition of the final reaction mixture in molar oxide ratios was 5.0 MeQ 2O Fe203 27.6 SiO2 8.0 Na2O 400 H2OThe reaction mixture was placed in a stainless steel pressure vessel lined with an inert plastic material polytetrafluoroethylene and heated in an oven at 2000C at the autogenous pressure for 46.0 hours.The solid reaction product was recovered by centrifugation, washed with water, and dried in air at 1000C. b A portion of the splid product of part a was analyzed by X ray analysis. This product had an X ray powder diffraction pattern characterized by the following data wherein 1 10 is the relative intensity and wdl the interplanar spacing The template is reported here and may be reported in the following examples as the cation or as tne cation associated in the oxide form. Thus, in the formula MeQ 2O the MeQ corresponds to the methylquinuclidine cation.

The FeSO 35 compositions were then tested for catalytic cracking. The test procedure employed was the catalytic cracking of premixed two 2 mole percent n butane in helium stream in a 1 2 O.D. quartz tube reactor over up to about 5 grams 20 40 mesh of the FeSO 35 sample to be tested. The sample was activated in situ for 60 minutes at 5000C under 200 cm min dry helium purge. Then the two 2 mole n butane in helium at a flow rate of 50 cm min was passed over the sample for 40 minutes with product stream analysis being carried out at 10 minute intervals. The pseudo first order rate constant kA was then calculated to determine the catalytic activity of the FeSO 35. The kA values cm g min obtained for the two FeSO 35 compositions were 3.7 and 1.2, respectively, showing FeSO 35 to be catalytically active for the conversion of organic feedstocks.
