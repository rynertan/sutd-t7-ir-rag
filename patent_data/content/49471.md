# Subscriber line testing apparatus.

## Abstract
A system for testing subscriber lines 5 and terminals 1 by leading the subscriber line to the testing system through an associated semiconductor switch 8 of a type driven by a constant current. The system includes a circuit 9 for varying a current fed through the switch 8 from the subscriber line 5 to be tested, a circuit 10 for measuring current values corresponding to the circuit states of the circuit 9 , and a circuit 11 for determining on the basis of the measured values derived from the measuring circuit 10 a current value from which the constant current component for driving the switch 8 is eliminated.
