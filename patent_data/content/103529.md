In general, any of the alkali or alkaline earth metal hydrides may be used in the practice of the present process. These include sodium hydride, potassium hydride, lithium hydride, magnesium hydride, calcium hydride, and the like. Sodium hydride is preferred. The process of the invention is carried out by reacting the benzylamine starting material with at least 1 molar equivalent of the malonic acid ester reactant although an excess of ester reactant can be used. A preferred range of malonic acid ester reactant to benzylamine reactant is from 1 to 10 moles of ester per mole of benzylamine. At least 1 mole of hydride per mole of benzylamine reactant should be used in the process of the invention, althoughan amount of hydride up to 50 moles of hydride per mole of benzylamine reactant can be used, if desired. The reaction is advantageously conducted at a temperature of from 50OC. to 5000C. While lower temperatures can be used, the reaction rates are generally correspondingly lower. Temperatures above 500 C. can be used, but excessive decomposition of the reaction components can occur. Reflux temperature at atmospheric pressure is effective and preferred. Typically, the reaction can be conducted at atmospheric pressure. However, higher pressures up to about 68.9 x 10 Pa of manometric pressure 1000 psig may be used, if desired. The use of a solvent for the reaction mixture is not generally required, especially if an excess of malonic acid ester reactant is used. However, if desired, a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, i.e., those solvents which do not enter into the reaction, may be added to the reaction vessel.Useful solvents comprise aprotic solvents which include ethers such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, l ethoxyhexane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4 dioxane, 1,3 dioxolane, diglyme, l,2 diethoxyethane, and tertiary amines such as pyridine, N ethylpiperidine, triethylamine, tributylamine, N,N diphenyl N methylamine, N,N dimethylalanine, etc. Especially useful solvents are dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfone, tetramethylene sulfone, N methylpyrrolidinone, acetonitrile and like materials.Other solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions may be used for example, low boiling hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, examples of which are benzene, toluene, tetrachloroethane, the chlorinated benzenes, the chlorinated toluenes, etc., and lower alkanols having up to about 6 carbon atoms. These include, methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropyl alcohol, n butanol, sec butyl alcohol, t butyl alcohol, n pentanol, isopentyl alcohol, n hexanol and isohexyl alcohol. The amount of solvent can be expressed as a volume ratio of solvent to benzylamine reactant. Suitable volume ratios of solvent to benzylamine reactant can be from 0 1 to 500 1 and preferably from 1 1 to 300 1. The mode of addition in the process is not particularly critical. Accordingly, it is convenient to add the benzylamine reactant to a mixture of the other materials, add the malonic acid ester compound to a mixture of the other materials, add the reactants to a mixture of the benzylamine and solvent, introduce all ingredients simultaneously into the reaction zone, or the like. The process should be carried out for the time sufficient to convert substantially all of the benzylamine reactant to the corresponding benzylated malonic acid ester. The length of time for optimum yield will depend primarily upon the reaction temperature and the particular solvent, if any, used in the reaction. In general, excellent yields of the benzylated malonic acid ester are obtained in from two to twenty four hours. Although not required, the process can be conducted in a substantially anhydrous reaction system, and accordingly, the components of the reaction system are brought together and maintained under a substantially dry, inert atmosphere. By substantially anhydrous is meant a reaction system wherein the total amount of water present is no more than about 5 percent by weight, based on the reaction mixture. When the amount of water in the system exceeds this, both reaction rate and yield of product decrease. The process may readily be conducted in a batchwise, semi batch or continuous manner and in conventional equipment. Optionally, metal halides such as the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal halides, for example, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, barium chloride, potassium chloride and the like, can be introduced into the reaction mixture, preferably in an amount from .01 to 10 mole percent of metal halide per mole of benzylamine reactant. It has been found that under certain reaction conditions, the presence of a metal halide in the reaction system appears to have a yield enhancing effect on the formation of the desired 3,5 dihydrocarbyl 4 hydroxybenzylmalonic acid ester product of the instant process.The process of the invention when run continuously can be illustrated schematically by the equation shown below. Rt, R2, R3,R4, R5, and R6 are the same radicals as described and exemplified above.

Also, a secondary amine is eliminated from the benzylamine starting reactant during the course of the reaction. Some bis hydroxyphenyl methane by product may be formed by the process. The benzylated malonic acid ester product is easily separated from the reaction mixture by such means as distillation, extraction, crystallization and other methods obvious to those skilled in the chemical processing art. The benzylated malonic acid ester products prepared by the process of this invention have antioxidant properties and are capable of stabilizing polymers normally subject to oxidative degradation when incorporated into the polymers using conventional techniques such as by addition to polymer lattices or by addition to solid polymers on a mill or in a Banbury. Further, the novel compounds of this invention are effective antioxidants in both unleaded and leaded gasolines made from a wide variety of base stocks and for engine and industrial oils which are derived from crude petroleun or produced synthetically. Thus, in another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a liquid hydrocarbon fuel of the gasoline boiling range for spark ignition internal combustion engines normally susceptible to deterioration in the presence of oxygen containing in an amount sufficient to inhibit such deterioration, a compound of the general formula EMI15.1 wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and are hydrogen or hydrocarbyl radicals, preferably alkyl, aralkyl or cycloalkyl radicals, having from 1 to 40 carbon atoms, and preferably from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, at least one of which is branched on the alpha carbon atom, with the provision that at least one of R1 orR2 must be other than hydrogen and R5 and R6 are the same or different and are hydrogen or linear or branched alkyl radicals having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms with the provision that at least one of R5 or R6 must be other than hydrogen. A still further embodiment of the present invention is lubricating oil normally susceptible to oxidative deterioration containing a small antioxidant quantity of a compound of the general formula EMI16.1 wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and are hydrogen or hydrocarbyl radicals, preferably alkyl, aralkyl or cycloalkyl radicals, having from 1 to 40 carbon atoms, and preferably from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, at least one of which is branched on the alpha carbon atom, with the provision that at least one of R1 orR2 must be other than hydrogen and R5 and R6 are the same or different and are hydrogen or linear or branched alkyl radicals having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms with the provision that at least one of R5 or R6 must be other than hydrogen. The practice of this invention will be still further apparent by the following illustrative examples.
