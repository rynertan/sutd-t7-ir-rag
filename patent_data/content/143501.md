# PROCESS FOR PREPARING ORGANIC ISOCYANATES

## Abstract
This invention relates to novel processes for preparing organic isocyanates from primary monoamines and phosgene in which the primary phosgenation step is carried out at elevated temperatures from about 75 C up to about 100 C. Sophisticated mixing apparati are not required. The primary monoamines can be aniline, a haloaniline, e.g., 3,4 dichloraniline, an alkylaniline, or a haloalkylaniline, e.g., 3 chloro 4 methylaniline.
