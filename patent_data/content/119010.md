## Abstract
In a casino game of two up or the like in which a person, known as the spinner, spins two coins whilst standing in a ring 10 , the total number of players is restricted and the players purchase their position in the ring by making a time based payment, the house making no charge other than this payment. The game also includes a possibility that players bet against the house and the return to the players is based on betting that the spun coins will fall so that either two heads or two tails will be uppermost or, alternatively, not only on two heads and two tails being uppermost but also on mixed heads and tails in either case the odds are adjusted so that over a period the house received a predetermined percentage of the total amount wagered. Above the ring 10 there is an obstruction such as a mesh 12 which, when struck by the coins, causes them to spin.

## Description
CASINO GAMEThis invention relates to a casino game and, in particular, to a casino adaptation of the game commonly called two up . The object of the game two up is for a spinner to spin two coins so they both land with a head uppermost and the spinner enters a bet which is covered by one of the other players. Other participants, and the spinner, can also enter side bets against each other on whether the coins will fall heads or tails . In this game, if one coin falls heads and the other tails, known as one of each , there is no result and the coins are re spun. Whilst in this specification I shall refer to coins having heads or tails, it is to be understood that any flat token, preferably circular in shape, having differentiable markings on opposite sides can be used.During the period whilst he is spinning, the spinner can, before each spin, withdraw some of the money which is held by the house.In this conventional game, where a spinner spins three heads in a row, the house takes 10 of all money bet on the particular spin.There have been proposed modifications of this game, for example that used inAustralian casinos, where the spinner must spin three heads consecutively, or spaced by mixed heads and tails, before he can withdraw any of the money won. In this game, if mixed heads and tails are spun five times consecutively, all money in the ring is lost.Both of these games have disadvantages as far as the players and the appropriate licensing authorities are concerned, the disadvantage in the first game being that it is necessary for the house commission to be taken from bets standing in the ring and the second, which is basically a disadvantage to the players, is that the whole of their bets can be lost on an unsuccessful run of mixed heads and tails. A further disadvantage is that, in order for the game to maintain the attention of the players and to be exciting, it is necessary that the coins, which are thrown from a kip , a flat piece of board held in the spinner s hand, should spin satisfactorily so the result is in doubt when the coins strike the floor of the ring. To do this takes a skill which is often not possessed by a novice.It is the principal object of the invention to provide modified forms of two up which are particularly suitable for casinos, in which the house commission is achieved simply and without inconvenience to the players.It is a second object of the invention to provide a ring in which the coins are constrained to spin satisfactorily.It is a third aspect to provide a ring where, provided the coins land within the bounds of the ring, they are assured of adopting a configuration of one face being upwardly directed.In the first form of game the number of players in a ring is restricted to a predetermined number and they purchase their position in the ring by making a time based payment. Once in the ring, they can bet against each other or against the house.In the modified form of game which is played against the house the return to the players is based on betting that either two heads or two tails will be uppermost or, alternatively, not only on two heads or two tails, but also on mixed heads and tails. In another case, the odds are adjusted so that the house receives, over a period, a percentage of the total amount wagered.The invention also includes a casino game of two up comprising a ring within which a spinner stands and outside which the other players are located and an obstruction located above at least portion of the ring, which obstruction is adapted to be struck by the coins to be thrown by the spinner to ensure that these are caused to spin.In this form it is preferred that the junction between the wall forming the boundary of the ring and the floor thereof is in the form of a continuous curve to ensure that any coin striking this junction is moved towards the centre of the ring.In order that the invention may be more readily understood, particular forms of the invention will be described in relation to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a view of a first form Fig. 2 is a view of a second form Fig. 3 is a view of a third form Pig. 4 is a view of a fourth form and Fig. 5 is a broken view of a form of the junction between the ring and the wall bounding the ring.I shall refer firstly to the form of ring illustrated in Fig. 1.The ring 10 must be of such a size as to provide freedom of movement of the spinner, the player who is spinning the coins, and the assistant or assistants who are running the game. It must also be of such a size as to permit coins spun into the air to land freely within the ruing, even if they are not spun directly upwardly.Also, the size of the ring determines the number of other players which can be located close to its periphery to be able to satisfactorily watch the game.It is to be understood that the players do not need to be directly adjacent the periphery of the ring, although this is preferable.Referring to Fig. 1, the ring 10 is substantially circular, but could be of any other required shape, and is surrounded by a viewing space 11 in which players can either stand or be seated.Located above the ring there is a mesh 12, which is preferably a taut wire mesh having a mesh spacing of, say, 5 cm the spacing being sufficient to permit relatively easy passage of the coins being used, which may be approximately 2.5 cm in diameter, but of such a size that there is a high likelihood that the coins will strike portion of the mesh, either on their passage up or down through the mesh, to thereby impart a spin to the coins.The coins are placed on a kip 13, which is a relatively flat piece of wood or other material, and an experienced spinner can, by twisting his wrist at the time of throwing the coins, cause them to spin through the air but a novice or unskilled spinner often finds that the coins float so that they spin little, if at all.By providing the mesh 12, I ensure that the coins, after striking the mesh when passing through in either direction, spin satisfactorily so that it is not possible to anticipate how the coins will land when they strike the floor of the ring 10.If, as may happen, a coin becomes lodged on the upper surface of the mesh 12, a rule may be made that the coin can be dislodged, say by striking the mesh with ball or the like, and that the coin, after falling to the ground can either, by definition, complete the spin or cause a nospin so that the spin is to be repeated. In practice, I have found there is little tendancy for the coins to be retained in the mesh.In a modified form of the ring, shown in Fig. 2, instead of the mesh 12, I provide an outwardly flared conical member 14, the centre of which lies above the centre of the ring.This member may be made of a hard material or of a fabric which is drawn relatively taut so that, on their passage, the coins tend to strike this member obliquely and this will ensure that a spin is given to the coins.In a second modified form, illustrated in Fig. 3, there is an open flared conical member 15, the centre of which lies above the centre of the ring. In this embodiment the coins are thrown to the inner surface of the cone and, on striking this obliquely, they are caused to spin. A still further modified form is illustrated in Pig. 4.This form, to a certain extent, can be considered a combination of the forms of Figs.1 and 3.In this case, the mesh 12 is placed over the open mouth of a canopy 16 or the like which is mounted above the ring.This arrangement has advantages over the version shown in Fig. I in that the mesh 12 is kept under the required tension at all times and it is relatively simple to remove the canopy 16 together with the mesh and to replace this where required.In the embodiment of Fig. 1 there can be difficulties in properly locating the mesh and maintaining it sufficiently taut.Also, whilst the sides of the canopy 16 are inwardly sloping, these tend to deflect inwardly coins which pass through the mesh 12 and strike the sides, so the coins leave the mesh somewhat towards the centre thereof. It has been found in use that this embodiment of the invention is very satisfactory and, because of its arrangement, it can be made to be aesthetically pleasing as well, as previously explained, as being portable.In a further alternative, instead of using a mesh, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 4, I may use parallel cords or wires. Preferably I use cords or wires in two spaced planes, with the wires in one plane being offset relative to those in the other. This overcomes any likelihood of a coin being caught on cross wires but still effectively ensures that the coins will strike at least one of the wires whilst moving into and out of the canopy.Also, although not illustrated, it is possible to provide lighting within the canopy and this, again, aids in the appearance of the canopy.Whilst in the embodiments of the Figures I have shown particular forms of obstructions which can cause the coins to spin, it is to be understood that these are purely exemplary.In a modified form of ring, I prefer that the wall 30 which separates the players from the playing surface of the ring 10 is continuous and may be provided with a gate or the like through which the spinner and the other officials of the game may pass.This is to ensure that the coins are kept within the bounds of the ring as defined by the wall 30.Rather than have the junction between the wall and the ring as a discontinuity, I prefer to provide an inwardly directed, curved lower edge 31 to the wall so that, should the coins strike adjacent the wall, they land on this curved surface which tends to move the coins back towards the centre of the ring and ensures that, at no time, can coins be caught at a discontinuity and cause a throw to be a nulity.As illustrated in Figs. 1 to 4, I show one side of a circular ring, and as a practical matter a circular ring is very satisfactory. However, this is no reason why, if required, a square, rectangular or other shaped ring could not be used and, preferably, in each such case, we can provide a curved inner surface, such as surface 31.In the first form of game I would anticipate providing, say, fifty chairs for players about the ring and with the spinner being a person from one of the chairs. Each player would pay a predetermined amount for the occupancy of a chair for a particular time and this one off payment would provide the whole payment to the house.The game can then be played in a completely conventional manner with the spinner receiving the normal odds of even money if he spins heads and losing should he spin tains.A mixed spin of one of each leaves the status quo and a further spin is effected.As far as side bets are concerned, these are made between the various players, including the spinner, if he so requires, or between the players and the house.The only differences from the conventional game is that the game is not disrupted after three consecutive spins of heads, as the house does not take commission in this way.Normally, the rules are that the spinner is spinning for heads and, wherther he is betting on heads or tails, the spinner remains spinning until he spins tails.It will be seen that, if the cost to join the game was, say, 20.00 per hour and there were fifty players, the house s commission would be 1,000.00 per hour, or some 8.75 million per year if the game were played at full capacity, twenty four hours per day.In the second form of modification the game is played against the house and is arranged for the house to pay on either two heads or two tails being spun or on two heads or on two tails or one of each being spun.In this form of game the odds are arranged to ensure that, over a period, the house receives a percentage of the monies bet.If the betting is on only heads or tails, the house payout would normally be 9 10, over a period a house take of 10 . The odds can be varied as required. This form of game can add to the suspense as, each time one of each is thrown, there are no successful, or no losing, bettors.In one particular form where a payout can be made on heads, tails or mixed spin, the arrangement can be a 2 1 payout for players correctly selecting heads or tails and a 4 6 payout for those correctly selecting one of each.On such an arrangement, in the long term, the house s take would be approximately 25 and there would, again, be no other house commission paid.In such forms of game the amount received by the house would not be as predictable as in the first form, but it would, nevertheless, provide a satisfactory game for players and, again, would avoid any disruption through the necessity of taking a house percentage after predetermined events or at predetermined times. In this form of the game it would be possible to provide, from the house commission, a certain percentage for a jackpot. This jackpot could be payable on a certain, rare, combination of spins, such as, for example, seven heads in a row. As the jackpot mounts, it will be appreciated that the players will be drawn to play the game with the hope that they could succeed in winning the jackpot.It will be understood that certain modifications can be made in these new variations of the game, particularly in the odds offered, provided such modifications are such as to permit the game to be readily controlled without disruption, whilst, at the same time, giving a pleasurable game to the players.
