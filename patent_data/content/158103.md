# Bread containing WXSU2 genotype starch as an anti stalent.

## Abstract
Chemically and yeast leavened bakery products which have improved shelf lives are provided by the inclusion of an effective amount of a starch or flour selected from a plant of a wxsuâ‚‚ genotype in the bakery product dough. Breads which contain the starch or flour, preferably obtained from maize, are provided with a softer, moister crumb after baking as well as a fresher texture and appearance after a storage period.
