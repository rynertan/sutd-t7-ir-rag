# Substituted benzyl diketones and process therefor.

## Abstract
The present invention deals with substituted benzyl diketones and a process for their preparation. Novel 2 3 min ,5 min dihydrocarbyl 4 min hydroxybenzyl 1,3 diketones are prepared by reacting an N,N dihydrocarbyl 2,6 dihydrocarbyl 4 aminomethylphenol with a 1,3 diketone and an alkyl halide in the presence of an alkali or an alkaline earth metal hydride. The resulting substituted benzyl diketones are useful as antioxidants into polymers, latices, liquid hydrocarbon fuels and lubricating oils.
