# Method and equipment for the mounting of electrical terminal boards.

## Abstract
A method for mounting elongated pin connectors 10 which have a connector body 11 and pin contact elements 5, wherein the pin contact elements are pressed, preferably in a single operation, into openings 7 of a circuit board 8 and into openings 90 of body 11 arranged below circuit board 8. A pressing tool 1 is provided for contact element combs 2 which have a pilot strip 6 to which contact elements 5 are attached. A clamping section 3 of the tool 1 is designed so that it severs pilot strip 6 when the contact elements are pressed into contact with circuit board 8. The connector body 11 has cams 93,94 adjacent slots 90 for forming an upper surface with their upper sides.
