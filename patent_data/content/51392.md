# Magnetic imaging system.

## Abstract
A magnetic imaging process and imaging member comprising an electrically conductive layer overcoated with an electrically resistive layer, wherein a latent magnetic image is formed on the imaging member by heating selected portions thereof. The latent image is then developed by contacting the imaging member with a magnetic toner composition. The developed image is transferred to a permanent substrate and fixed thereto.
