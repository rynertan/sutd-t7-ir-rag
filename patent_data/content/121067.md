# Process for the preparation of oligosaccharide fractions having pharmacological properties by chemical degradation of heparin.

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of oligosaccharides and oligosaccharide fractions by degradation of heparin, which comprises submitting to incubation an aqueous solution of heparin containing from 5 to 30 g of heparin liter in the pres ence of 4 50 m.moles l of cupric acetate and 50 300 m.moles 1 of hydrogen peroxide, at a temperature of 40 50 C, for 20 24 hours and keeping the pH at a value of 7.8 by means of sodium acetate. The obtained products show a high inhibiting property of the Xa factor, a high antithrombotic activity and a very modest anticoagulant activity therefore they are very interesting for a possible utilization as drugs in the antithrombotic treatment, practically free from any risk of haemorrhages.
