# Immuno agglutination particle suspensions.

## Abstract
A suspension of diagnostic particles comprising antibo dy molecules attached to a carboxylate derivatized polymer core is provided for agglutination tests. The antibody is link ed to the core through an avidin biotin bridge. Avidin is join ed by an amide bond to carboxyl groups on the core, and biotin is linked by an amide bond to amino groups on the an tibody molecule. The core bound antibody is exposed to a mixture of free biotin and biotinylated antibody to attach a controlled amount of antibody that is consistent with sus pension stability prior to its use in a test and rapid crosslink ing of suspended particles in the presence of antigen.
