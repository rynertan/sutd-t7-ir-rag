# A process for utilizing tobacco dust.

## Abstract
A process for employing tobacco fines or dust is disclosed. The tobacco fines are dispersed in an aqueous liquid and applied to tobacco or reconstituted tobacco. In the preparation of reconstituted tobacco, the fines are incorpo rated into concentrated tobacco extract before the extract is recombined with the reconstituted sheet or into an aqueous carrier. The slurry of fines in extract or other carrier is passed through a homogenizer and then is applied as a coating to the sheet prior to drying and shredding. In application to tobacco strip and other tobacco blend components, the fines are combined with casing and the combination is homoge nized to reduce the particle size and produce a uniform distribution. This is then sprayed by the casing applicator system onto the strip the dried product is no more dusty in subsequent cutting and handling than is the strip without the added fines.

## Description
A PROCESS FOR UTILIZING TOBACCO DUST This invention pertains to the field of smoking materials. More particularly, the present invention concerns a method for preparing a smoking material with leaf lamina, strip or other tobacco components, or with reconstituted tobacco having tobacco dust or fines incorporated therein. As a result of treating, handling and shipping tobacco in its various forms, notably cigar wrappers or fillers, cigarettes, and smoking tobacco, tobacco fines or dust is generally formed. This dust, generally less than about one centimeter in size, is recovered from air filters, tobacco screens and other separating systems. These tobacco fines or dust have commonly been discarded or employed in conjunction with other tobacco by products, such as stems, stalks and leaf scraps resulting from the stripping of leaf tobacco, in the preparation of reconstituted tobacco material. One process for making reconstituted tobacco sheets involves casting or forming a paste or slurry of refined tobacco by products, including dust, onto a moving belt. In such a technique, the employment of very fine tobacco particles is feasible inasmuch as these tobacco dust particles are simply retained on the moving belt, present no manufacturing difficulties and are not lost during the sheet formation. This is not, however, true in a paper making type process for the preparation of reconstituted tobacco. More particularly, when employing a papermaking process for preparing reconstituted tobacco, the tobacco dust must generally be discarded or employed elsewhere. This is due to the fact that in the papermaking process, the slurry of refined tobacco by products is cast from a head box onto a wire screen for forming the desired sheet. If the screen mesh size is too large, the dust particles simply pass through the wire screen and do not, as a result, become incorporated in the resulting sheet. Conversely, when the screen mesh size is reduced so as to prevent the tobacco dust particles from passing therethrough, the dust considerably slows the drainage of the water through the screen and correspondingly slows the rate of sheet formation by actually plugging and or clogging the wire screen openings. Accordingly, although the paper making type process for making reconstituted tobacdo material has many advantages over the alternative casting moving belt method, particularly, in that a binder is not required to hold the fibers together and a significant amount of solubles can be removed from the tobacco material to be treated separately and later reincorporated in the resulting sheet, and is consequently the preferred method, it nevertheless does suffer from the disadvantage of not being able to efficiently and conveniently employ tobacco dust by product. However, with increased handling of tobacco, as is the case e.g. with expansion processes, and with increased speed of cigarette makers, larger amounts of dust is generated than in the past.Reconstitution processes are no longer able to assimilate all of the dust and the alternative of discarding as waste is not attractive. It is also standard practice in the preparation of tobacco strip to apply so called casing , containing flavors, sugars, humectant and the like in solvent, to the strip by spraying. Though some finely pulverized flavor materials have sometimes been added to casing, it has never been known to incorporate tobacco dust ito casing. Presumably it is supposed that the dust particles would clog the spray nozzles or associated parts of the systems. The present invention presents a way of incorpOrating this material into a smoking product with a minimum of added equipment, which avoids substantially all of the above noted disadvantages associated with a paper making type of process in the preparation of reconstituted tobacco containing tobacco dust. In accordance with the present invention, tobacco dust is dispersed in an aqueous liquid medium and applied to tobacco or reconstituted tobacco.A mixture of the fines or dust with an.aqueous medium may be treated to form a uniform dispersion, for example by homogenizing. The medium may contain dissolved solids, which may assist in retaining the fines or dust on the tobacco or reconstituted product. Such solids may comprise, for example, those substances conventionally present in tobacco casing , extracts of tobacco solubles, or gums. According to a first aspect of the invention, the fines or dust is mixed with casing, which may be processed through a homogenizer to reduce the larger particles, in order that the product will be accepted by whatever applicator is used to put the casing on tobacco strip or filler, usually, a spray head. Alternatively, the fines or dust may be ground prior to mixing with the casing. The dried, reordered product is not sticky and generally is no more dusty than the same strip or filler without added fines. Casing applied to tobacco strip or cut filler is essentially a liquid and is handled as such in conveying and in applying, Thus spray application is the conventional means. The present invention contemplates combining tobacco fines with casing or water and homogenizing the combination into a slurry in order that the product can be handled with the casing applicator already in use usually a spray system . Alternatively, the dust may be ground before being combined with the casing or water and subsequently dispersed into a slurry. High shear rate dispersion is preferable such that the dust and liquid combination is placed in turbulence during mixing. The particles for this purpose must preferably be no larger than about 500 microns, and more preferably less than 100 microns in diameter.However, reducing the fines to this size is not essential and satisfactory results may be obtained with particles of 1000 microns and larger with a corresponding decrease in particle size reduction requirements. Larger particles do, however, result in a slurry of increased viscosity when the slurry is homogenized. Conversely the viscosity of a slurry of dry ground tobacco mixed or dispersed in casing decreases with increased particle size. Viscosity is an important factor in the application of the slurry. The viscosity of the slurry generally decreases with increased motion and sheer rate. Preferably, for the effectiveness and ease of application, slurry viscosity as measured on a Haake viscometer should be no greater than three hundred centipoise measured at about 180 F and a shear rate of about 600 1 sec .Some viscosities in the examples herein were measured at a lower shear rate of about 24 1 sec at about 180 F on a Brookfield Model RVT viscometer and are appropriately designated. Preferably tobacco dust is added to liquid at a proportion of up to two pounds of dust per gallon liquid.Satisfactory results have been obtained with between one tenth. to five pounds of added dust per gallon of liquid. The invention, however, is not limited to these proportions. Upon combination of the tobacco dust with the casing, water or other appropriate aqueous liquid, a portion of the dust will dissolve and a portion will remain dispersed as particulate solids. Thus, the combination of the dust and the liquid produces both a solution and a suspension or dispersion. Subsequent homogenization of the combination to evenly distribute the solids, and in some methods according to the present invention to also reduce the size of the solid tobacco particles, results in a product referred to herewithin as a homogeneous mixture. This homogeneous mixture is typically between fourteen and fifty percent solids. The slurry is applied to the tobacco at a rate of preferably between about one and nine gallons slurry per one hundred pounds tobacco with a preferable dust addition of between one and ten weight percent. However satisfactory bulks have been obtained with an application rate of from about one tenth to about thirty gallons per one hundred pounds tobacco with a dust addition of about one tenth to about thirty weight percent. Of course, the invention is not limited to these rates and any rate may be used. However, at low application rates the process becomes less economical and at high application rates the adhesion of the slurry may be less complete. The result is that when the casing composition is applied to strip or filler, and the cased product dried and further processed, the dusting problem is no greater than had the tobacco dust not been added. A further finding is that the dust particles are so reduced in size that they are not noticeable on the tobacco. Thus, material which might otherwise be wasted is utilized in smoking product without addition of any new non tobacco ingredient, and without visible change to the product. Filler in the sense used here is intended to embrace rolled cut stem, expanded or not, expanded shreds, and like filler ingredients. As a supplement to alter the viscosity of the combination, a natural or synthetic gum may be added to the casing provided that it is soluble in the latter. This may increase the viscosity and also improve the binding effect of the casing for the fine tobacco particles. In another aspect, the invention provides a method for economically utilizing tobacco dust by products in a paper making type process for making reconstituted tobacco. This method not only reduces the loss of the dust through the wire screen when the screen openings are too large and further more reduces clogging and or plugging of the screen openings when these openings are too small, but additionally, the method of the present invention actually increases the rate of drainage through the wire screen correspondingly increasing the rate of production of the reconstituted tobacco sheet and improving its quality by allowing better refining of the remaining tobacco stem feedstock. In this aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for employing tobacco dust in the preparation of reconstituted tobacco which comprises admixing tobacco dust with the extract liquor which has been concentrated in steam evaporators after, recovery from extraction presses. The mixture is then passed through a homogenizer or mixer to refine and uniformly disperse th.c particles in the concentrated extract. The viscous product is applied to the reconstituted tobacco web which has been removed from the Fourdrinier wire, and the coated web is then dried in the usual fashion. Final cutting, shredding,and blending into cigarette filler or the like is conventional. The method for utilizing tobacco dust in the preparation of reconstituted tobacco employing a papermaking process calls for certain modifications in the usual process. Tobacco dust by product material is first collected. It may be used totally apart from the Fourdrinier feedstock, or a portion may be sent with the stems while the remainder is kept for the coating preparation. This separated fines fraction is blended with concentrated extract as will be described below. Meanwhile, the said feedstock, according to the usual process, is diluted with 500 to 700 parts of water per 100 parts of solids and is passed into refiners which beat the stems to form a smooth, well blended fiber slurry.This is concentrated in an extraction press by removal of about five sixths of the liquid extract which is sent to the concentrators. Here steam heating vaporizes a portion of the water. The stock from the press is diluted with white water from the Fourdrinier to a consistency which is suitable for application to the wire at the headbox of the Fourdrinier. That part of the process is conventional in the extract recombine papermaking reconstitution process. The concentrated extract, according to the present invention, is blended with the separated dust fraction in preparation of a coating for reapplication, by any of the following alternatives 1. The blend of concentrate and fines is homogenized wetmilled in the tobacco extract liquor, as for example in a Gaulin homogenizer or the like or the dry dust is dry dust Is dry milled prior to dispersing with the extract and dispersed into a slurry. High shear rate dispersion is preferable such that the dust and liquid combination is placed in turbulance during mixing 2. The dust, before blending, is treated with a pectin release agent such as aqueous diammonium phosphate to release the tobacco pectins and the resulting dispersion is blended with the extract in a more concentrated form to allow for the dilution which results or 3.The dust is moistened with water and treated with steam to soften and loosen the particles, resulting in a thick paste which is then blended with concentrated extract, and optionally homogenized as under 1 for preparation of a coating composition. The coating is applied to the formed moving tobacco web ahead of the dryers, at or near the point where the sizing press is located in the basic process. The application may be by a roll coater, reverse roll coater, blade coater, high pressure spray, or any similar means for applying viscous liquid to a running web.When dry, the reconstituted tobacco sheet is not sticky and does not shed dust before, during, or after cutting, to any greater degree than the conventional reconstitued product. The maximum acceptable particle size in the coating depends on both adherence of the particle to the web and aesthetics of the coated web. Particles of 1000 microns and larger will adhere. However, particles this large give the coated web a sandpaper like texture and appearance. A smaller particle size gives a corresponding smoother appearance closer to that of leaf. When the paper making process does not involve a 5epar√§te reapplication if the tobacco solubles as discussed above, for example, the process of U.S. Patent 3,415,253, the fines may be dispersed in water in place of extract and applied for one of the three alternative treatments described. The addition of a gum to the water is optional. The invention will be described in greater detail by reference to a number of examples of its practical application. In these examples, reference is made to several measurements or parameters of significance in the manufacture of tobacco smoking materials. The term cylinder volume is a measure of the relative filling power of tobacco or reconstituted tobacco for making smoking products. Higher cylinder volume means higher filling power, or capacity to make more satisfactory cigarettes with a given unit weight.The term oven volatiles describes a measure of the approximate moisture content or percentage of moisture in tobacco or reconstituted tobacco. As used throughout this specification, the values employed to characterize tobacco or reconstituted tobacco, in connection with these terms, are determined as follows Cylinder Volume CV Tobacco or reconstituted tobacco filler weighing 10.000 g is placed in a 3.358 cm diameter cylinder and compressed by a..1875 g piston 3.335 cm in diameter for five minutes. The resulting volume of filler is reported as cylinder volume. This test is carried out at standard environmental conditions of 24 C and 60 RH conventionally unless otherwise stated, the sample is preconditioned in this environment for 18 hours.Oven Volatiles Content OV The sample of tobacco or reconstituted tobacco is weighed before and after exposure for 3 hours in a circulating air oven controlled at 1000C 2120F . The weight loss as percentage of initial weight is the ovenvolatiles content. Equilibrium OV and Equilibration The OV after equilibration has significance in comparing properties of smoking materials at the same conditions. Materials are, generally, equilibrated reordered at conditions which are well known in the trade.Equilibrating is preferably done at standard conditions, which generally involve maintaining the tobacco at a temperature of 24 0C 75 0F and 60t RH relative humidity for at least 18 hours.Hot Water Solubles HWS This is a straightforward measurement of the weight loss from a sample boiled in water for.an hour and filtered.Particle Screen Sizes Longs are defined as filler particles held back by 1.91 mm 0.075 inch screen openings. Mediums are particles which are held back by 0.86 mm 0.034 inch screen openings. Shorts are held back by 0.51 mm 0.020 inch openings. Smalls are held back by 0.28 mm 0.011 inch openings. Fines pass through that screen.Standard Smoking Procedure Test smoking by machine was done according to theFTC method as described by Pillsbury et al., J. Assoc. Offic. Anal. Chemists 52 458 462 1969 . Example I Reconstituted tobacco was made by an extractrecombine paper making process from a stem and fines feedstock containing approximately 37 by weight of fines.This will be considered the control In a similar operation approximately 54 of the fines was withdrawn from the feedstock and the web was prepared while the extract liquor was diverted from the sizing press. The fines which had been withdrawn were combined with the extract liquor which had first been concentrated to approximately 45X solubles, and the combination was passed through a Gaulin homogenizer. The product was applied by a biade coater at various loadings to one side of the reconstituted sheet which was, then passed through the drying system and shredded as filler. It was observed that the coating did not appreciably impregnate the web, but remained essentially on the surface where applied.Test results and OV and solubles analysis are given in Table I. Some web was also coated on both sides. Example 2 With a papermaking process all fines were withdrawn from feedstock. They were blended into concentrated extract liquor too ether with diammonium phosphate to release the pectins from the tobacco material. After thorough blending, the product was coated with the combined material by blade coater on one side of the web and the product dried in the usual way. The reconstituted filler from this process did not show a loss in filling power in spite of the build up of solids on the sheet.

In each run, one batch was treated with casing in the conventional way. A second portion of casing was blended with 10 parts of tobacco fines per 100 parts of strip to be treated, and the mixture was passed through a Gaulin homogenizer. The product was sprayed on a second batch of Burley strip, the ratio of casing to strip being the same as before. The two batches were dried as in the conventidnal process to cutting moisture. After cutting, the filler was dried to equilibrium conditions 60 RH 240C and subjected to tests and analysis with results shown in Tables II and III. When cigarettes were made from these, losses at the maker were as given in Table.IV. The shredded strip was blended as the Burley component in commercial filler and used in making cigarettes see Table V. Table VI shows sieve comparisons. Cigarettes properties and smoking test results by the standard FTC method are given in Table VII for both blend and all Burley cigarettes. It will be seen that the tests cigarettes made with Burley according to the process of the invention are comparable in all respects with the conventional control cigarettes.

The Burley strip was dried for 20 minutes at 121 132 C 250 2700F to a moisture of 20 percent. Essentially all of the applied dust adhered to theBurley strip.The resulting product had CV of 43.0 versus the control sample CV of 42.1. EXAMPLE 11 Tobacco dust was mixed with water at a concentration of 228 kg m3 1.9 pounds dust per gallon water, homogenized in aGaulin homogenizer to obtain d slurry being 17 percent solids.Blended cut filler was reordered to 19 percent moisture. The slurry was sprayed on the reordered blended cut filler at a rate of 80 cm3 kg .96 gallons slurry to 100 pounds of blended cut filler to obtain a dust add on rate of 1.8 weight percent. The filler was dried to 11 14 percent OV. Essentially all of the applied dust adhered to the burley strip. The resulting product and the control sample each had a CV of 36.7, at an OV of 12.5. EXAMPLE 12 Tobacco dust was mixed with water at a concentration of 174 kg m3 1.45 pounds per gallon water and homogenized in aGaulin homogenizer to make a slurry having 13.5 percent solids.Burley strip was dried to an OV of 12.1. The slurry was sprayed on the expanded stem at a rate of 542 cm3 kg 6.5 gallons of slurry to 100 pounds of expanded stem to obtain a dust content of 8 weight percent. Essentially all of the applied dust adhered to the expanded stem. The resulting product had a CV of 42.5 at an OV of 14, compared to a control sample CV of 44.3 at an OV of 14. EXAMPLE 13 Tobacco dust having a particle size distribution of 63 percent smaller er than 225 microns was mixed with casing at a concentration of 134 kg m3 1.12 pounds per gallon casing and homogenized in a Gaul in homogenizer to make a slurry having a distribution of particle size of 95 percent smaller than 125 microns and approximately 25 percent solids. The slurry was diluted with 7 parts water per part casing to obtain an approximate viscosity of 1500 cps Brookfield . A blend of bright and Turkish Oriental tobacco was reordered from 15 to 17 percent OV moisture. The homogenized slurry is sprayed on the reordered bright Oriental strip at a rate of 646 cm3 kg 7.74 gallons per 100 pounds of bright Oriental strip to obtain a dust add on rate of 7.5 weight percent. Essentially all of the applied dust adhered to the bright Oriental strip. The resulting product had a CV of 29.0 cc l0g at an OV of 13.1 percent. The control bright Oriental material had a CV of 29.0 cc l0g at an OV of 13.0 percent. Any cigarette blend component may be treated in the same way. Alternatively, tobacco fines may be dispersed in water and homogenized, with added gum or a pectin release agent such as aqueous diammonium phosphate for tobacco pectins if desired, for application to strip or other tobacco blend component.
