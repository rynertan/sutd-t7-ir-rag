# Shaped polyethylene articles of intermediate molecular weight and high modulus.

## Abstract
Solutions of intermediate molecular weight polymers from about 200,000 to about 4,000,000, such as polyethylene, in a relatively non volatile solvent are extruded through an aperature at constant concentration and thereafter stretched at a ratio of at least about 3 1 prior to cooling to form a first gel. The first gels are extracted with a volatile solvent to form a second gel, and the second gel is dried to form a low porosity xerogel. Stretching occurs with any one or more of the first gel, second gel or xerogel. The polyethylene products produced by our process include products having a molecular weight between about 200,000 and about 4,000,000 a tenacity of at least about 13 grams denier, a modulus of at least about 350 gram denier, a porosity of less than 10 by volume, a crystalline orientation function of at least about 0.95, and a main melting temperature of at least about 140 C.
