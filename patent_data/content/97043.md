# WEIGHING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Weighing apparatus, which is suitable for weighing live stock. The apparatus is formed by a crate, which is open at at least one end and provides a platform on which an object to be weighed may be located, and a frame encompassing but spaced from said crate. The crate is slung by a single point from said weighing device mounted by the frame. Crate restraining means maintain said crate in a spaced relationship from the frame. The restraining means comprises a single flexible member and a single anchor point and tie on each end of said crate and a sirgla mounting on opposite sides of said frame. The arrangement is such that in use when said flexible member is tensioned and anchored the crate is re strained from lateral movement against the frame without af lecting vertical loading on the single point weighing device.
