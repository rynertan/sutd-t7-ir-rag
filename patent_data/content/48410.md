# A laser device for an endoscope.

## Abstract
A laser device for an endoscope 18 capable of ejecting medical treatment laser beams and illumination light beams into the endoscope 18 through a laser beam probe 16 comprises a medical treatment laser beam oscillator 3 which is received in a housing to emit laser beams, an illumination light source 4 which is received in the housing and includes a turntable 12 with a plurality of different color filters 14 to selectively emit at least two visible rays having different colors, and an optical system 5 which brings the optical axis 10 of laser beams emitted from the oscillator 3 in alignment with the optical axis 6 of visible rays issued from the illumination light source 4 , thereby conducting said laser beams and illumination light beams to a light emitting section of the housing.
