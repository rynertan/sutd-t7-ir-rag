# A method of fertilising plants.

## Abstract
Finely ground adularia shale provides an effective fertiliser even though potassium silicate is water insoluble.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A method of fertilising plants which comprises applying to the media in which the plants grow the mineral adularia in fine particulate form. 2. A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the adularia is applied as a component of a naturally occurring shale. 3. A method as claimed in either Claim 1 orClaim 2 wherein the shale contains calcium and megnesium. 4. A method as claimed in either Claim 2 orClaim 3 wherein the shale is ground to pass 100 mesh. 5. A method of manufacturing a fertiliser which consists of finely grinding naturally occurring adularia shale.

## Description
DESCRIPTION This invention relates to the nutrition of plants and has for an objective the provision of an improved plant nutrient or fertiliser hereinafter referred to as a fertiliser. We have found that the mineral adularia which may be defined as a potassium feldspar formed at a low temperature, is an effective fertiliser providing potassium for the plants. The adularia is applied to the soil in fine particulate form. Horespecifically we propose as a fertiliser adularia shale which is naturally occurring, for example in N.W. Scotland. This adularia shale contains 45 50 per cent adularia potassiumaluminium silicate and has a potash content of between 10 and 12 per cent by weight. It is believed that the effectiveness of the adularia shale as a fertiliser when applied in finely ground pulverised form stems from the low temperature of formation and the fact that the crystal size of the adularia is very small averaging 50 microns in diameter. Adularia differs markedly from feldspars containing potash that are formed at high temperatures and which occur in igneous rocks and pegmatites. High temperature feldspars usually form large crystals. The adularias primarily envisaged are formed following sedimentation but metamorphosed adularias are not excluded provided that their low temperature characteristics are re tained. The surface area resulting from the small size of the crystals, together with their partial liberation by fine grinding typically for 100 to pass o inch mesh and 25 to pass 100 B.S.S. British Standard Sieve which is 150 microns, makes the potash available to plants despite its water insoluble silicate form. The potassium salts normally used as fertilisers are water soluble and hitherto this solubility has been considered essential. The waterinsolubility of adularia is, however, an advantageous rather than an adverse feature because the new fertiliser should not be removed in rtin off water and should therefore remain active for some years.The exact mechanism of the surprising uptake of water insoluble potash by plants is not fully understood but it is believed that the potash is taken in through the root hairs possibly after having been set free by acids and active hydrogen ions produced by the plant. Soil is known to retain potassium better if calcium and magnesium are also present and this enhances the value of the naturally occurring adularia shale which contains between 0.5 and 6 per cent by weight CaO and 1.5 to 5 per cent by weight MgO. Tests carried out on adularia shale naturally occurring at Skaig Bridge, Loch Assynt,Sutherland Map Reference NC 235 244 taken and then finely ground showed the following results during the 1979 growing season Approximate analysis of adularia shale from Skaig Bridge Wt.

Grass showed a 28 per cent increase in uptake on one farts and 3.6 on another farm, in this case for the second crop of grass. This gives proof, in the instances tested, not only of a substantial increased yield, but also provides evidence that potash is taken up both in the case of herbage and root crops.
