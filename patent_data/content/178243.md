# Process for making powdered rubber.

## Abstract
The conventional processing of rubbers into shaped articles of manufacture normally include a compounding step. In this compounding step the rubber is mixed with fill ers, curatives, and various other additives so as to obtain a homogeneous mixture. The relatively high viscosity of these raw materials makes it necessary to utilize heavy machin ery, such as Banbury mixers, which consume large amounts of energy in the mixing procedure. The present invention provides an improved process for the production of tack free, pourable, filler containing pow dered rubber. This powdered rubber can be compounded eliminating in whole or in part the need for heavy equipment which consumes high amounts of energy. This invention more specifically reveals that in a process for the production of tack free, pourable, filler containing elastomer powder which comprises a dispersing a carbon black filler in water b mixing the thus dispersed carbon black filler with an elastomer solution and a surfactant to produce an elastomer emulsion c coagulating the emulsion d partitioning the coagulated elastomer emulsion with a coating resin which is comprised of at least one co polymer containing from 70 to 97 by weight vinyl aromatic monomers and from 3 to 30 by weight diene monomers and e filtering, washing and drying the resultant powder.
