# Method and apparatus for attaching fly strips to a slide fastener chain.

## Abstract
Successive fly strips P are continuously sewn to a con tinuous slide fastener chain F by a continuously operating sewing machine as the fly strips P are supplied one after an other to the sewing machine. During this supplying, a succeed ing fly strip P is superimposed over a preceding fly strip P in a feed station while the preceding fly strip P is supplied to the sewing machine and is sewn to the fastener chain F . The suc ceeding fly strip P is kept waiting by a stop 12 in its super imposed position for supply to the sewing machine. When the trailing end of the preceding fly strip P is advanced by the sewing machine from the trailing end of the succeeding fly strip P as the sewing of the preceding fly strip P pro gresses, the succeeding fly strip P is supplied to the sewing station at a speed higher than the rate at which the sewing of the preceding fly strip P progresses. The succeeding fly strip s trailing end catches up with the preceding fly strip s trailing end by the time the latter arrives at the sewing station, contiguous abutting end fashion.
