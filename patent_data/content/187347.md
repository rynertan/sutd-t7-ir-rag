# DRIVER CIRCUIT FOR ELECTROLUMINESCENT DISPLAY

## Abstract
A driver circuit for an electroluminescent matrix type display includes a brightness control circuit 430 for essen tially eliminating variations in luminescence inverse sha dowing of display pixels 101 by controlling the time rate of change of the pixel drive voltage at and above the threshold voltage for light emission. The brightness control circuit 430 varies the row drive voltage Rhv to compensate for load variation arising from changes in the number of pixels to be lit in a row. It includes a counter 435 for counting the number of pixels to be lit, a conversion circuit 440 for converting the count into an analog voltage 443 and a summation circuit 445 for adding the analog voltage 443 to a minimum row drive voltage Rhv min . The brightness circuit 430 is reset for each new row to be driven to develop a new count of pixels to be lit from pixel selection pulses to a column driver circuit 420 .
