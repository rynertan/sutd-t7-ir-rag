## Description
OPTICALLY CLEAR SILICONE COMPOSITIONS CURABLE TO ELASTOMERS This invention relates to optically clear silicone ompositions which are curable to elastomers comprising at least one polydiorganosiloxane and a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler wherein the silica filler particles are sufficiently small in their largest dimensions that optically clear compositions result even when the refractive index of the polydiorganosiloxane is not matched with that of the filler. This invention also relates to a method of preparing such compositions. This invention also relates to the optically clear elastomers obtained when such compositions are cured. Silicone elastomers, more commonly known as silicone rubbers, find use in many diverse areas such as sealants, tubing, prosthetic devices, wire insulation, molding compounds, contact lenses, solvent resistant hoses and many other uses. In applications where optical clarity is a necessity, compositions consisting of polydiorganosiloxanes such as polydimethylsiloxane gums can be vulcanized or cured to form optically clear elastomeric products. However, when the cured elastomer consists solely of a cured polydiorganosiloxane, the physical properties of the elastomer are poor. To improve these properties, reinforcing fillers such as finely divided silica are added to the gum prior to curing.A surface treated hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler is often employed because such a filler not only improves the physical properties of the cured elastomer as compared with curing the polydiorganosiloxane alone, but also avoids the weil known problem of crepe aging or structuring of the uncured composition. The addition of hydrophobic reinforcing silica fillers has the disadvantage of increasing the optical haze of the compositions and cured elastomers depending upon the types and amounts of polydiorganosiloxanes, filler and other components present i the formulation. Thus the compositions and cured elastomers are no longer as optically clear as the cured polydiorganosiloxanes themselves although they may appear transparent in thin sheets where the haze is less noticeable. Contact lenses consisting of transparent silicone rubber containing silica fillers are described inU.S. Patent No. 3,228,741 issued January 11, 1966, toBecker and British Patent No. 922,871 issued April 3, 1963 to Mueller Welt Contact Lenses, Inc. Transparent room temperature vulcanizable silicone rubber stocks are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,408,325 issued October 29, 1968, to Hittmair et al. and in U.S. Patent No. 3,474,064 issued October 21, 1969 also to Hittmair et al. Hittmair et 1. teach compositions which are composed of organopolysiloxanes which can also contain fill ers.The latter 064 patent teaches that a cured elastomer derived from 100 parts of a hydroxyl endblocked dimethylpolysiloxane, 10 parts of a fume silica, 5 parts of a hydroxylated methylpolysiloxane fluid and a small amount of a curing agent was sufficiently transparent that print from a typewriter could readily be seen and read through a 4 millimeter mm sheet of the cured elastomer although nothing was mentioned regarding the haziness of the sample. A commonly accepted explanation for the amount of haze which results when a silica filler is added to a polydiorganosiloxane which would otherwise cure to form an optically clear elastomer is that the haze appears to be related to the difference in refractive index R.I. between the silica filler R.I. approximately 1.42 to i.46 at 250C, Sodium D wavelength and the polydiorganosiloxane.The haze is apparent to the naked eye in 2.54 mm 100 mil thicknesses when a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler is mixed with a polydimethylsiloxane gum R.I. approximately 1.40 and especially when mixed with a fluorine containing polydiorganosiloxane gum such as poly 3,3,3 trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane gum R.I. approximately 1.38 . One prior art solution to the problem of haziness involves the use of polydiorganosiloxanes containing silicon bonded organic radicals such as phenyl radicals in sufficient amounts such that the refractive index of the polydiorganosiloxanes in the composition matches the refractive index of the silica filler, thereby obtaining optically clear compositions and cured elastomers.Examples of such an approach are found in U.S. Patent Nos.3,996,189 issued December 7, 1976 and 3,996,187, issuedDecember 7, 1976, both to Travnicek, which teach optically clear silicone elastomers and contact lenses reinforced with fume silica fillers. These patents teach that 80 to 95 parts of one or two polydiorganosiloxanes containing from 6 to 16 mole percent phenyl groups can be mixed with from 5 to 20 parts of a fume silica to obtain optically clear reinforced silicone elastomers while a polydiorganosiloxane which is free of phenyl groups such as a dimethylpolysiloxane containing a small percentage of vinyl groups results in a hazy material which had inadequate optical clarity. In U.S.Patent No. 3,624,023, issued November 30, 1971, Hartlage teaches compositions containing a surface treated fume silica filler and a hydroxyl endblocked polydiorganosiloxane containing phenylmethylpolysiloxane units which are vulcanizable to transparent silicone rubbers under ambient conditions. In U.S. Patent No. 4,008,198, issued February 15, 1977, Krohberger et al. teach that highly transparent or optically clear elastomers can be obtained by mixing 1 a nitrogen compound containing at least one triorganosilyl group of a particular type, 2 a hexaorganodisilazane, 3 silicon dioxide having a surface area of at least 50 m2 g and 4 a highly viscous polydiorganosiloxane and then kneading the mixture at 1500C under a vacuum until there is r.o evidence that nitrogen compounds are being evolved.The examples contained therein report that a composition prepared using a polydimethylsiloxane containing a small percentage of vinyl radicals possessed a light transparency value of 91 and a composition prepared using a polydimethylsiloxane containing 5.5 mole percent of diphenylsiloxane units and a larger percentage of methylvinylsiloxane units than in the previous example possessed a light transparency value of 96 which is consistent with the prior art technique of obtaining compositions possessing improved optical clarity by matching the refractive index de filler with that of the polydiorganosiloxane. Thehazevalue of each composition is not reported. Iler, in U.S. Patent No. 2,786,042, issuedMarch 19, 1957, teaches the preparation of sols of sursace treated colloidal silica particles which are said to have an average diameter of from 10 to 150 millimicrons.Iler teaches that such particles can be added to plastics in the form of an orgdnosol to improve the physical properties of the plastics and teaches that even transparent or translucent plastics which have an index of refraction near that of colloidal silica will retain their transparency when filled. One disadvantage possessed by the use of a refractive index matching technique is that one is necessarily limited in the choice of polydiorganosiloxanes which can be employed. Mixtures of polydiorganosiloxanes having similar refractive indices can be employed which, as a total mixture, match the refractive index of the silica filler, but this requires the use of extra ingredients and can thereby increase the cost of the optically clear compositioM. Batch to batch variations in the refractive index of the polydiorganosiloxanes may also affect the optical clarity of the composition and cured elastomer. Another disadvantage of the refractive index matching technique is that such compositions and cured elastomers tend to increase in haze value with increasing temperature. This is believed to be the result of a change in the refractive index of the polydiorganosiloxane component of the mixture which is not matched by a corresponding change in the refractive index of the filler.Such an increase in haze can be detrimental where such cured elastomers are used as an interlayer in windshields used in supersonic aircraft where the windshields are known to heat up at high speeds due to the flow of air molecules across the windshield during flight. Another approach to obtaining transparent compositions is exemplified by Daudt in U.S. Patent No.3,036,985, issued May 29, 1962, which employs a copolymeric filler composed of QSiO3 2 units, SiO2 units, CH3 2SiO units and CH3 3Si0l 2 units where Q is an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical of less than 5 carbon atoms. The ratio of the various polymer siloxane units in the filler is said to be critical in obtaining silicone rubber possessing the combination of optical clarity and good stress strain properties described in the patent specjification. This approach requires the use of a cog el filler produced by first preparing a cogel of SiO2 units and QSiO3 2 units and then reacting the cogel with organosilicon compounds containing CH3 2SiO and or CH3 3SiOl 2 units to products a filler with he required ratio of siloxane units. From the foregoing discussion, it appears that there is a a need for an optically clear polydiorganosiloxane composition curable to an elastomer which overcomes the above problems. The present invention provides an optically clear polydiorganosiloxane composition containing a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler which can be cured to form an elastomer. These compositions possess a luminous transmittance value of greater than 85 and a haze value of less than 48 per 2.54 millimeter 100 mil thickness without the necessity for matching the refractive index of the polydiorganos loxane with that of the silica fillet.A further advantage of such compositions resides in the fact that the haze value of such compositions changes very little when the composition is heated from 250C to 100 C when compared with compositions wherein the optic al clarity obtained by matching the refractive index of the polydiorganosiloxahe o that of the filler. Compositione of the present invention can utilize various types of polydiorganositoxanees, especially polydiethylsiloxanes and poly 3, 3,3 trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes, provided that the polydiorganosiloxanes chosen can be cured to form optically clear compositions in the absence of silica fillers. The cured products are reinforced elastomers useful as optically clear articles.The present invention also provides a method for preparing the above compositions which employs the use of a wet or fluid filler composition. The optical clarity i s obtained through the useof a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler consisting of surface treated particles consisting essentially of SiO4 2 units wherein substantially all of the particles are of such a size that when properly incorporated into the polydiorganosiloxane, they do not appreciably scatter light and hence result in optically clear compositions regardless of the refractive index of the polydiorganosiloxane employed. Furthermore, the silica filler particles are of such a shape that they result in reinforced silicone elastomers. For the purposes of the present invention, the term silica particles11 as used hereinafter is intended to include both primary silica particles and aggregates of such primary particles. This invention relates to an optically clear composition curable to an elastomer which co prises A 100 parts by weight of at least one polydiorgano siloxane consisting essentially of siloxane units selected from the group consisting of siloxane units of the average unit formula EMI10.1 wherein each R radical is selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals cf from 1 to 6 inclusive carbon atoms, cyclohexyl radicals, phenyl radicals, halogenated alkyl radicals of from 1 to 10 inclusive carbon atoms and alkenyl radicals of from 2 to 6 inclusive carbon atoms, each X being selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen radicals and alkoxy radicals of from 1 to 6 inclusive carbon atoms, at least 50 percent of the total amount of R radicals andEMI10.2 radicals present in said polydiorganosiloxane being methyl radicals, a having a value of from 0 to 1 inclusive, b having a value of from 1 to 3 inclusive and c having a value of from 0 to 1 inclusive, the sum of a b having a value of from 1 to 3 inclusive, the sum of a c having atv lue of from 0 to 1 inclusive, the values ofOai b and c being such that the ratio of total R radicals and EMI11.1 radicals vo total silicon atoms present in said poly diorganosiloxane is in the range of from 1.98 1 to 2.02 1 inclusive, said polydiorganosiloxane having a viscosity of at least 0.1 pascalseconds at 250C, and B 15 to 120 parts by weight of a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler consisting essentially of surface treated silica particles wherein said particles consist essentially of SiO4 2 units containing a sufficient amount of organosiloxy units chemically bonded to the surface of said particles to render the silica filler hydrophobic, said organosiloxy units being selected from the group consisting of R3SiOl 2 units, R2SiO units, Ol 2R2SiO R2SiO dSiR2pl 2 units, XR2SiO R2SiO dSiR2Ol 2 units and mixtures thereof where each R and each X are as above defined and d has an average value of from 1 to 12 inclusive, wherein substantially all of said particles of B are sufficiently small in their largest dimension such that the mixture of A and B is an optically clear composition possessing a luminous transmittance value of at least 85 and a haze value of no greater than 4 per 2.54 millimeter thickness of sa id composition at 230 20C according to the procedure set out in ASTM D1003 61 and wherein the haze value of a composition consisting of a mixture of 100 cubic centimeters of A at 230 20C and 60 grams of B does not increase by more than 1 per 2.54 millimeter thickness of said mixture upon heating the mixture from 230 20C to 1000 50C. This invention also relates to a composition as described above containing at least one curing agent. This invention further relates to an elastomer formed upon curing the above described compositions. This invention further relates to a method of producing optically clear compositions curable to elastomers which comprises the steps of I mixing the above polydiorganosiloxanes with either a wet, gelled filler composition or a wet, fluid composition containing the above hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler to form a mixture and II removing the volatile portion of said mixture to form an optically clear composition. This invention further relates to the above method which additionally includes the step of mixing at least one curing agent into the composition. Component A is at i eÅast one polydiorganosiloxane which is at least one linear or substantially linear polymer consisting essentially ot of combination of the above described siloxane units such that in the polydiorganosiloxane as a whole there is an average of from 1.98 to 2.02 inclusive R radicals andEMI13.1 radicals attached to silicon per silicon atom. The term consisting essentially of is intended to mean that the above described polydiorganosiloxanes can also contain relatively minor amounts of monoorganosiloxane and triorganosiloxane units of the average unit formulaRSiO3 2 and R3SiO1 2 wherein each R is described above.Such units can be present only in minor amounts such that the average ratio of R radicals andEMI13.2 radicals to silicon atoms is from 1.98 1 to 2.02 1 inclusive. As is well known in the art, it is often advantageous to employ triorganosiloxane end blocked polydiorganosiloxanes, such as those endblocked with trimethylsiloxy, dimethylvinylsiloxy or methylphenylvinylsiloxy units. The polydiorganosiloxanes useful in compositions of the present invention are those which are capable of being cured to an elastomer and consist essentially of siloxane units selected from the group consisting of siloxane unit s of the average unit formula XaRbSiO4 a b and 2EMI14.1 where each R can be an alkyl radical of from 1 to 6 inclusive carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl or hexyl cyclohexyl radicals, phenyl radicals, halogenated alkyl radicals of from 1 to 10 inclusive carbon atoms such as chloromethyl, 3 chloropropyl, bromodecyl, 3, 3, 3 trichloropropyl or fluoroalkyl radicals of the formula CtF2t lCH2CH2 where t has a value of from 1 to 8 inclusive such as CF3CH2CH2, C3F7CH2CH2, C7F15CH2CH2 and C8F17CH2CH2 and alkenyl radicals of from 2 to 6 inclusive carbon atoms such as vinyl, allyl, or hexenyl.Each X can be a hydroxyl radical, a hydrogen radical or an alkoxy radical of from 1 to 6 inclusive carbon atoms such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isobutoxy hexoxy radicals.The term consisting essentially of siloxane units is also intended to mean that relatively minor amounts of siloxane units containing other types of organic radicals can be present in polydiorganosiloxanes useful in the present invention as long as both the optical clarity and the ability of the polydiorganosiloxanes to cure to form an elastomer has not been impaired by their presence. The values of a, b and c are described above and are such that the ratio of R radicals andEMI15.1 radicals to silicon atoms in the polydiorganosiloxane is as above. Examples of siloxane units are CH3 2SiO, CH3CH2CH2 CH3 SiO, H CH3 SiO,EMI15.2 C2H5 CH3SiO, C2H3 CH3SiO, C6H5 CH3SiO, and C5H6 2SiO, among others, and endblocking units such as HO CH2 2SiO1 2, C2H3 CH3 2SiO1 2, CH3 3SiO1 2, CH3O CH3 2SiO1 2, CH3 C6H5 C2H3 SiO1 2 andEMI15.3 among others. The polydiorganosiloxanes can be homopolymers of the above siloxane units such as a hydroxy endbiocked polydimethylsiloxane or can consist of a combination of different siloxane units such as a copolymer of CF3CH2CH2 CH3SiO units and C2H3 CH3SiO units or a polydiorganosiloxane consisting essentially of CH3 2SiO units, C6H5 CH3SiO units and C2R3 CH3SiO units which is endblocked with C2H3 CH3 2SiOl 2 units, provided that there is an average of from 1.98 to 2.02 inclusive R radicals andEMI16.1 radicals per silicon atom present in the polydiorganosiloxane The above polydiorganosiloxanes must have a viscosity of at least 0.1 pascal seconds 100 centipoise at 250C and at least 50 percent of the total R groups in the polydiorganosiloxane should be methyl radicals to obtain an elastomeric product with reasonably good physical properties upon curing the compositions of the present invention.Preferably, the R radicals are methyl radicals, vinyl radicals, 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl radicals or combinations thereof, each X is a hydroxy radical, methoxy radical or ethoxy radical, and the polydiorganosiloxane contains no more than 5 mole percent of siloxane units containing vinyl radicals, there being no more than one vinyl radical and no more than one 3,3,3 trifl.uoropropyl radical per siloxane unit. More preferably, the polydiorganosiloxane contains at least two siloxane units containing vinyl radicals. Phenyl radicals can be used to improve the low temperature flexibility or oxidation resistance of the cured elastomers, but are not necessary to obtain optically clear compositions.For example, cured elastomers can be prepared using polydiorganosiloxane gums which are composed of dimethylsiloxÅane and at least 7 mole percent of 3,3,3 trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane unit. Such elastomers are known to possess good low temperature flexibility. Cured elastomers with a high degree of solvent resistance can be obtained when polydiorganosiloxanes consisting primarily of 3,3,3 trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane units are employed. To obtain good solvent resistance, it is preferred that at least 95 mole percent of the siloxane units present contain 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl radicals, more preferably, there being no more than one such radical per siloxane unit. To prepare low consistency compositions which can be squeezed from a tube during application, e.g., for use as sealants, it is preferable that the viscosity of the polydiorganosiloxane be low enough that it is a fluid material, preferably less than 10 pascalseconds and more preferably less than 5 pasc l seconds at 250C. High consistency formulations which can be used in the manufacture of eyepieces for gas masks or windshield interlayers preferably employ gums which have a viscosity of at least 10 kilopasalseconds 10,000,000 centipoise at 250C or, using another commonly accepted designation, the Williams plasticity of the gum is greater than about 50 mils 1.27 mm at 250C.Polydiorganosiloxanes useful in compositions of the present invention are known articles of commerce and many are commercially available. Methods for their manufacture are well known in the art as exemplified by the following United States Patents 2,490,357 Hyde issued December 6, 1949 2,542,334 Hyde issuedFebruary 20, 1951 2,927,907 Polmanteer issued March 8, 1960 3,002,951 Johannson issued October 3, 1961 3,161,614 Brown et al. issued December 15, 1964 3,186,967 Nitzche et al. issued June 1, 1965 3,509,191 Atwell issued April 28, 1970 and 3,697,473 Polmanteer et al. issued October 10, 1927 which are hereby incorporated by reference to teach some of the types of well known polydiorganosiloxanes which may find use in the compositions of the present invention and methods for their preparation. The novel feature of the optically clear compositions of the present invention resides in the use of a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler wherein substantially all of the filler particles are sufficiently small in their largest dimensions that a composition containing a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler can be obtained which possesses the same order of magnitude of optical clarity as does the filler free composition itself.The term hydrophobic is intended to mean that at least 70 percent and preferably all of the dry filler is visually observed to float on top of distilled water after a small amount of the filler has been added to a half filled container of water and vigorously shaken. Hydrophobic fillers are employed to minimize or completely avoid the necessity for the use of additives such as low molecular weight hyaroxyl endblocked polydimethylsiloxane fluids to overcome the problem of crepe aging of the composition which is believed to be due to filler polydiorganosiloxane interactions. The amount of filler is based upon the amount of polydiorganosiloxane present in the composition and can be present on a dry solids basis of from 15 to 120 parts by weight of filler per 100 parts by weight of polydiorganosiloxane present. Minor amounts of cross linking compounds such as polyorganosiloxanes containing silicon hydride radicals are not included in the calculation of parts of filler. Fifteen parts of filler is about the minimum needed to obtain a useful reinforced elastomeric product while 120 parts is about the maximum which can be added. As is known to those skilled in the art, not all reinforcing silica fillers can be utilized at high filler loading levels. Some fillers with very high surface areas absorb essentially all of the polydiorganosiloxane and the use of too much filler results in a hard or crumbly, useless product. More preferably, the amount of filler utilized is in the range of from 40 to 90 parts by weight of filler per 100 parts by weight of polydiorgano s iloxane. The filler itself consists essentially of surface treated silica particles and the term consisting essentially of is intended to mean that there may be a small amount of low molecular weight polysiloxanes present in the filler which are soluble in aromatic solvents such as benzene or toluene due to the manner in which the filler is prepared. As long as the amount of such low molecular weight material is on the order of a few percent or less, it will not affect the reinforcing properties of the filler. The surface treated silica particles themselves are particles consisting essentially of a core of SiO4 2 units and are not cogels of QSiO3 2 and SiO2 SiO4 2 units such as the fillers described in U.S. Patent No. 3,036,985 to Daudt described above.These particles are believed to form a central core of SiO4 2 units which contains a sufficient amount of organosiloxy units chemically bonded to the surface of the core to surface treat or form at least a monolayer at the surface of the core to result in hydrophobic filler particles. For the purposes of the present invention, the term 1units11 includes both the monoeric units and the polymeric groups as hereinafter illustrated. These organosiloxy units are selected from the group consisting of R3SiOl 2 units, R2SiO units,Ol 2R2SiO R2SiO dSiR2Ol 2 units both ends of the polysiloxane being bonded to the surface of the silica particles , XR2SiO R2SiO dSiR2Ol 2 units and mixtures thereof where each R and X were previously described and d has an average value of from 1 to 12 inclusive.Examples of such units are CH3 3SiOl 2 units, CH3 2SiO units, CF3CH2CH2 CH3 2SiOl 2 units and CH3O CH3 2SiO CH3 2SiO dSi CH3 2O1 2 units. The silica fillers useful in the present invention must possess a structure which is capable of acting as a reinforcing filler for silicone rubber as the term is generally used by those skilled in the art. It is very difficult to accurately define the silica fillers which will result in optically clear compositions in terms of the physical characteristics alone. In general, a surface treated silica filler of the type described above which falls within the scope of each and every one of the following criteria would be expected to result in optically clear compositions. Substantially all of the silica particles of the filler should have less than 4,000Angstroms as their largest dimension when observed under an electron microscope, i.e., the particles should be smaller than the smallest wavelength of visible light to avold light scattering which produces haze.The filler should also have a specific surface area within the range of about 250 to 900 m2 g measured on a dry sample by a modified B.E.T. adsorption method of the type first described byNelson et al. in Anal. Chem. 30, pp. 1387ff 1958 , a pore volume within the range of 0.5 to 7.0 cm3 g pore volume can be measured as the volume of a low molecular weight, low viscosity oil which is just sufficient to completely wet out a known weight of filler or by employing the method described in ASTM C699 79 , an effective refractive index within the range of about 1.42 to 1.46 at 250C, Sodium D wavelength and a real density not bulk density in the range of from 1.24 to 1.95 g cm3 real density is measured using a displacement method such as the one set out inASTM C699 79 which employs placing a known weight of filler in a known density and volume of a non volatile liquid to accurately determine the actual volume occupied by the filler . As is well known in the art, silica fillers are generally made up of primary particles or ultimate particles of very small dimensions which can be aggregated into what have been called secondary particles1, or simply aggregates which are made up of a number of primary particles chemically bonded to each other to form a structured silica particle which is capable of acting as a reinforcing filler for silicone rubber. It is these latter particles or aggregates which should be sufficiently small in their largest dimensions to result in the optically clear compositions of the present invention. The particle size distribution should also be such that optically clear compositions can be obtained. On pages 462 to 510 of The Chemistry of theSilicates, John Wiley Sons, Inc. 1979 , Iler describes some of the structure of silica gels and powders, and , in particular, the analytical methods available for measuring the physical properties of such gels and powders. These pages are hereby incorporated by reference to teach these analytical methods. When observed under an electron microscope, silica filler samples which would give optically clear compositions were found to be substantially composed cf particles which were, on the average, noticeably smaller in their largest dimensions than were the particles of fume silica fillers which did not give optically clear compositions.However, electron microscopy techniques were not considered to be accurate enough to be able to predict which fillers would give optically clear compositions due to the extremely small amount of filler which can be observed under high magnification and due to the fact that one cannot be assured that the tiny sample observed is representative of the entire filler. However, the above filler measurements are useful as guidelines in selecting fillers for use in optically clear compositions. The simplest and most practical method for determining whether or not a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler is useful in the compositions of the present invention is to measure the haze value and the luminous transmittance value of a 2.54 millimeter mm thickness of the homogeneously blended composition. Preferably the measurements are made on a sample pressed between two sheets of clean glass to insure that a uniform thickness of the composition is being used during the measurement process. Hydrophobic reinforcing silica fillers possessing the requisite filler particle size and particle size distribution will result in compositions having haze values of less than 4 per 2.54 mm thickness and luminous transmittance values of at least 85 per 2.54 mm thickness when the filler is homogeneously blended with the polydiorganosiloxane s chosen.Use of the above measurements to select fillers avoids the above described lack of accuracy which is inherent in the use of an electron microscopic technique to identify potentially useful fillers. The procedure followed to obtain the above values is set out in ASTM D1003 61. The instrument used to obtain the values reported in the following examples was aGardner Pivotable Sphere Hazemeter Model HG 1024 equipped with a Model PG 5500 Digital Photometer GardnerLaboratory, Bethesda, MD 20014 . CIE Source A, sometimes called Illuminant A, was used in measuring the above values. Another test which is useful in identifiying silica fillers having the required filler particle dimensions involves preparing a homogeneously blended mixture of 100 cubic centimeters. cc, measured at 230 20C of thepolydiorganosiloxane, or mixtures of two or more thereof, chosen and 60 grams of the hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler to be evaluated. The haze value of a uniform 2.54 mm thickness of this mixture should not increase by more than 1 percent upon heating the mixture from 230 20C to 1000 59C. The refractive index of a polydiorganosiloxane is known to change upon heating.Therefore, if the optical clarity of the mixture results from the prior art technique of refractive index matching, for example when phenyl radicals are employed for the purpose of adjusting the refractive index of the polydiorganosiloxane to that of the silica filler, the haze value of the mixture at 1000 50C will be larger than that of the same composition at 230 20C due to the increased difference between the refractive index of the polydiorganosiloxane and the silica filler at the higher temperature.Compositions of the present invention do not rely upon refractive index matching to obtain optical clarity and therefore the haze value of such compositions at 100 5 C will not increase by more than 1 percent from the haze value measured at the lower temperature. The hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler useful in the compositions of the present invention can be differentiated from others which have a larger overall particle size and require refractive index matching of the filler with the polymer to obtain optically clear compositions simply by measuring the refractive index of the filler and combining that filler with a polydiorganosiloxane having a refractive index which differs from that of the filler by at least 0.025 units.For example, a composition containing a hydrophobic, reinforcing silica filler of a sufficiently small particle size a refractive index about 1.428 would be expected to possess a haze value of less than 4 percent per 2.54 mm thickness when it is combined with a polydimethylsiloxane gum having a refractive index of about 1.403, especially when 60 grams or more of such a filler is combined with 100 cc of polydiorganosiloxane as described above. Thus, the term optically clear as used in describing the compositions of the present invention means that the composition possesses a luminous transmittance value of at least 85 , a haze value of no greater than 4 percent and the haze value of a homogeneously blended mixture consisting of 60 grams of filler and 100 cc of either one polydiorganosiloxane or mixtures of two or more thereof, does not increase in haze value by more than 1 percent upon heating the mixture from 23020C to 1000t50C, all values being based upon a uniform 2.54 mm thickness of the composition. As will be noted, infra, the compositions should be within the first two haze and luminous transmittance value limitations when curing agents and, if any are used, other additives are present in the composition. Heating may cause compositions containing curing agents to cure, so the last measurement which involves heating the mixture i s preferably made in the absence of a curing agent. The silica fillers must be reinforcing fillers as the term is generally recognized in the art. It is well known that many types of filler can be used to reinforce silicone rubber, for example, increase the tensile strength, when the filler is present in a sufficiently large amount even when the filler does not possess the necessary structure to act as an efficient reinforcing agent. This is a wasteful use of filler and even though the cured elastomer may possess a tensile strength in excess of 6.2 megapasals 900 p.s.i. , the tear strength or durometer values may be very low. This invention is directed towards compositions containing a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler which will result in a useful cured silicone elastomer with a good balance of physical properties and a reasonable amount of filler. For the purposes of the present invention, a hydrophobic silica filler is considered to be a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler for silicone rubber if the tensile strength at break of a vulcanized silicone rubber consisting of a cross linked polydimethylsiloxane gum and the silica filler to be evaluated is at least 6.2 MPa 900 p.s.i. . Such an evaluation can be carried out by using a formulation composed of a mixture of 100 parts by weight of a dize ç lvinylsiloxy endblocked polydiorganosiloxane gum consisting essentially of 99.86 mole percent of dimethylsiloxane units and 0.14 mole percent of methylvinylsiloxane units based upon the total moles of diorganosiloxane units present it being understood that a minor amount of other types of units such as SiO4 2 and CH3SiO3 2 may be present as a result of impurities introduced during the manufacture of such a gum wherein the polymer has a Williams plasticity 4.2 gram sample in the range of about 55 65 mils 1.40 1.65 millimeters , 60 parts by weight of the filler to be evaluated non volatile filler solids and 1 part by weight of 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di t butylperoxy hexane catalyst. This formulation is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature after mixing, re milled on a two roll mill to soften the stock and heat press cured in a molding chase for 10 minutes at about 170 l750C. The tensile strength exhibited by such cured elastomer stocks, measured according to ASTM D412, should be at least 6.2 MPa 900 p.s.i. .When fillers which have been rendered hydrophobic with organosilicon hydrophobing compounds containing fluorinated alkyl radicals are to be evaluated, it is preferable to employ the above procedure using 45 parts of non volatile filler solids and tasubsttitute a fluorine containing polydiorganòsi loxaRe gum having the composition described as Gum C, infra, having a Williams plasticity in the range of 90 125.mils 2.29 3.18 mm for the above polydiorganosiloxane gum. The best method presently known to the applicants for producing such a filler is by the alkaline hydrolysis of an alkyl silicate such as methyl orthosilicate, Si CCH3 4 ethyl orthosilicate, Si C2H5 4 methyl polysilicate or ethyl polysilicate, preferably, the latter two alkyl silicate have an average molecular weight of less than 1000 g mole. More preferably, the alkyl silicate is methyl orthosilicate. The hydrolysis is conducted under alkaline conditions in the presence of at least 70 of one half of the stoichiometric amount of water necessary to completely hydrolyze the theoretical amount of alkoxy groups present in the alkyl silicate chosen.To insure solubility of the alkyl silicate and to aid in the formation of a silica filler having the proper structure and particle size, at least one water miscible lower aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol and isopropanol can be present during the hydrolysis of the alkyl silicate. Alcohol is also formed during the hydrolysis of the alkyl silicate and aids in the initial solutilization of the alkyl silicate thereby promoting the . xpi hydrolysis and condensation of the alkyl silicate linto a silica filler having the desired particle s ize. Preferably, at least 50 percent by weight of the total amount of alcohol the sum of the alcohol added and that generated by hydrolysis and water present in a hydrolysis mixture consisting of alkyl silicate, water, alcohol and basic catalyst used to render the mixture alkaline be alcohol. The preferred alcohol is methanol. The hydrolysis and condensation of alkyl silicates is known to proceed according to the following general equationEMI31.1 where Z is a methyl group in the case of methyl orthosilicate or methyl polysilicate and Z is an ethyl group in the case of ethyl orthosilicate or ethyl polysilicate. Therefore in the total reaction, one half mole of water per alkoxy or OZ group in the alkyl silicate 100 of the theoretical or staichiometric amount is required to completely hydrolyze the alkyl silicate to form a hydrolyzed adduct which then condenses into the corresponding theoretical SiO4 2 or silicon dioxide units.It will be assumed that the alkyl silicate is completely hydrolyzed and condensed although it is well. known that the actual structure of the silica filler coreis not entirely made up of SiO4 2 units because some of thea silicon atoms have hydroxyl and alkoxy radicals remaining after the hydrolysis and condensation reaction is completed. The actual amount of hydroxyl and alkoxy radicals remaining in the product is dependent upon several variables such as the amount of water, alcohol and or catalyst initially present and also upon the theoretical SiO2 content of the hydrolysis mixture.For this reason, about 70 of one half of the theoretical or stóichiometric amount of water necessary to completely hydrolyze the alkoxy groups on the alkyl silicate is the minimum amount that can be used to produce silica fillers according to this method. It can be preferable to use approximately 100 of one half of the stoichiometric amount of water because the resulting silica filler containing compositions are substantially free of water and as a result, there is one less component to be separated during the re cycling of the volatile liquid by products. However, satisfactory hydrophobic reinforcing silica fillers can also be produced by the above method when greater than 120 of one half of the stoichiometric amount of water is present in the mixture. The amount of alkyl silicate employed should be sufficient to provide at least 3 parts by weight of theoretical Ski04 2 units per 100 parts by weight of the total amount of alkyl silicate, water, alcohol and basic catalyst present in the formulation to obtain a commercially practical amount of filler and the maximum amount is governed by the theoretical maximum which iss about 32 parts by weight of theoretical SiO4 2 units in the case of methyl orthosilicate.Because the hydrolysis reaction is exothermic and becomes more difficult to ccntrol above 20 parts of theoretical SiO units, a preferred range is from 3 to 20 inclusive parts and more preferably, in the range of from 8 to 17 inclusive parts of theoretical SiO4 2 units per 100 parts of the above total. The organosiloxy units employed to render the surface of the silica filler hydrophobic are derived from organosilicon hydrophobing compounds such as organosilanes, organosilazanes, low molecular weight diorganopolysiloxanes and diorganopolysilazanes which will not render the reaction mixture acidic. Suitable organosilicon hydrophobing compounds can be those possessing the average formula RnSiY4n, R3Si 2NH, R3Si 20, R2SiO e, R2SiNH e,R O R2SiO dR , R3Si 2NR and R2SiNR e and mixtures thereof. Each R can be hydrogen or R . Each R can be an alkyl radical of from 1 to 4 inclusive carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl or isobutyl.EachY can be OH, OR such as methoxy or butoxy, NHR such as NHCH3 or NHCH2CH3, or NR 2 such as N CH3 2 or N C2Hs 2. The average value of n is from 2 to 3 inclusive, R and d are as above and e has an average value of from 3 to 6 inclusive. The amount of organosilicon hydrophobing compound which is useful in rendering the silica filler hydrophobic can be calculated on the basis of moles of hydrophobe agent per mole of theoretical SiO4 2 units present in the filler and must be employed in sufficient amounts to render the silica filler hydrophobic. Generally, at least 0.05 moles of organosilicon hydrophobing compound per mole of SiO4 2 units is required. More preferably, in the case of organosilicon hydrophobing compounds of the average formula R2SiO e, R2SiNH e, RnSiY4n where n has an average value of 2, R2SiNR e and R O R2SiO dR , a range of from 0.05 to 0.5 moles of organosilicon hydrophobing compounds per mole of SiO4 2 units is generally sufficient.In the case of organosilicon hydrophobwng compounds of the average formula R3Si 2NH, R3Si 2O and R3Si 2NR , a range of from 0.08 to 0.5 moles of organosilicon hydrophobing compounds per mole of theoretical SiO4 2 units is generally sufficient. In the case of organosilicon hydrophobing compounds of the average formula RnSiZ4 n where n has an average value of 3, a range of about 0.15 to 1.0 moles of hydrophobe agent per mole of theorethical SiO2 units is generally sufficient.For example, one mole of hexamethyldisilazane is considered to be one mole of hydrophobe agent for the purposes of this calculation, but i is recognized that this compound provides two moles of organosiloxy units trimethylsiloxy units per mole of hexamethyldisilazane. Examples of suitable organosilicon hydrophobing compounds are organosilanes such as dimethyldimethoxysilane, methylethyldimethoxysilane, methylvinyldimethoxysilane, 3,3, 3 trifluoropropylmethyldimethoxysilane, trimethylmethoxysilane, trimethylsilanol, dimethylphenylmethoxysilane, dimethylpropylmethoxysilane, dimethylphenylpropoxysilane, CH3 3SiNH2, CH3 3SiNHCH3, CH3 2i NHCH3 2, CH3 3SiN CH3 2, sym tetramethyldiinyl disilazane, sym tetramethyl bis 3, 3,3 trifluoropropyldi silazane, sym tetramethyldiphenyldisilazane, symtetramethyldivinyldisiloxane, and hexamethyldisiloxane cyclic polyorganosiloxanes such as 1,3,5 trimethyl 1,3,5 trivinylcyclotrisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, 1,3,5 trimethyl 1,3,5 tris 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl cyclotrisiloxane , hexamethylcyclotrisilazane and octamethylcyclotetrasilazane and linear polydiorganosiloxanes such as a mixture of methoxyendblocked polydimethylsiloxanes of the average general formula CH30 CH3 2SiO dCH3 where d has an average value of from 5 7 wherein the mixture is formed by adding a basic catalyst to a methanol solution of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, and linear polydimethylsiloxanes such as HOf CH3 2SiO dOH. Mixtures of different organosilicon hydrophobing compounds can also be used.Preferred among the organosilicon hydrophobing compounds are one or more compounds having the average unit formula CH3 3Si 2NH, f CH3 2 CF3CH2CH2 Si2NH, CH3 R tSiO e, CH3O CH3 R SiO dR and CH3 R 11Si OR 2 wherein each R is a methyl radical, a 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl radical or a vinyl radical, each R is hydrogen or a methyl radical and the average value of e is about 3. To obtain optimum optical clarity, it is preferred that the R and R radicals present in the organosiloxy units employed to render the filler hydrophobic be primarily the same as theR radicals found in the polydiorganosiloxanes with which the fillers are mixed.The term primarily is intended to mean that minor amounts of the organosiloxy units present on the filler can possess radicals which are not contained in the polydiorganosiloxanes employed while major amounts of such units do contain radicals which correspond with the radicals found in the polydiorganosiloxane.For example, when these fillers are to be used in compositions containing fluorinated polydiorganosiloxanes such as a poly 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl methylsiloxane gum, it is preferable to use major amounts of fluorine containing organosilicon hydrophobing compounds such as CH3 2 CF3CH2CH2 SiY2NH and minor amounts of compounds which do not contain fluorinated radicals such as CH3 C2H3 Si OCH3 2 to render the filler hydrophobic to insure that the polydiorganosiloxane and the surfacetreated silica filler form compatible mixtures. When organosilicon hydrophobing agents such as hexamethyldisiloxane are employed which require hydrolysis to liberate a reactive species such as Ca3 3SiOH and, as in the case of hexamethyldisilazane, to liberate a volatile base, there should be a sufficient amount of water present to hydrolyze such compounds in addition to the amount of water required to hydrolyze the alkyl silicate. Basic catalysts which are suitable for use in the present invention are those compounds which are capable of rendering the mixture alkaline. Examples of such catalysts are inorganic compounds such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, ammonium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and lithium hydroxide, organic compounds such as amines such as ethylamine, dimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, and N,N dimethylethanolamine, or alkali salts of carboxylic acids such as sodium acetate, ammonium acetate and sodium formate. Also useful as suitable basic catalysts are the organosilazane compounds suggested above as being useful as organosilicon hydrophobing compounds. Thus, a sufficient amount of a compound such as hexamethyldisilazane can serve as both a basic catalyst and as an organosilicon hydrophobing compound. It is preferable to use volatile basic compounds such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, and or compounds which generate volatile bases such as hexamethyldisilazane to avoid introducing undesirable ionic salts into the silica filler containing composition. Strong bases such as sodium hydroxide can affect the structure of the silica and render silica filler produced in this manner non reinforcing. It is believed that the presence of alcohols retards this effect, but it is preferable to avoid the use of such strongly basic compounds. There should be a sufficient amount of at least one basic catalyst present to result in a silica filler containing composition with a pH of greater than 7.Typically, the pH is in the range of about 9 to 12.5. The preferred method for producing silica fillers useful in the present invention using alkaline hydrolysis of an alkyl silicate involves mixing the water, alcohol and any basic catalyst not provided by the organosilicon hydrophobing compound together with stirring. The organosilicon hydrophobing compound or compounds is then added and allowed to stir for a short time. The alkyl silicate is then rapidly added to the stirring mixture to form a silica filler containing composition. After the addition of the last ingredietnt, the composition is allowed to age for a sufficient amout of time until a sample of the filler obtained by drying aesample of the above composition is considered to be hydrophobic.Generally, the composition is aged between thirty minutes and twenty four hours and preferably between thirty minutes and four hours prior to use. Longer periods of aging do not appear to be detrimental to the optical clarity of elastomers prepared from the filler compositions provided that the filler composition is not allowed to become dry prior to the elastomer preparation. Alternatively, the organosilicon hydrophobing compound s can be mixed together with the alkyl silicate to form a solution and that solution can be rapidly added to the remaining ingredients as described above to form a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler containing composition which is then aged as above. This method of mixing is preferred when the organosilicon hydrophobing compound is the sole source of basic catalyst. The mixing and aging steps in both methods can be carried out at room temperature or at temperatures up to the boiling point of. the volatile portion of the composition. Preferably, the mixing and aging steps take place at room temperature. These fillers will generally contain up to about 3 percent by weight of alkoxy groups, methoxy groups in the case of methyl orthosilicate, based upon the total weight of filler. During the aging step, the composition may gel.However, the silica filler containing composition itself need not be in the form of a wet, gelled filler composition. It was found that if a stirring means which possessed a sufficient amount of torque to break up gel particles as they were formed, such as a gear driven mechanical stirrer, was empl oyed both during the addition of the alkyl silicate and thereafter, the resulting composition remained in a fluid, pourable state for a sufficient amount of time to enable the composition to be pumped through pipes to the site where it was to be incorporated into the polydiorganosiloxane even though in the absence of such stirring means, the same formulation would result in a wet, gelled filler composition. Either the wet, gelled filler compositions or the wet, fluid filler compositions can be compounded with the polydiorganosiloxanes as hereinafter described.The term wet is intended to mean a gel in the form of a hydrogel or an organogel. The volatile portion of the composition can be replaced by another liquid such as toluene as long as the process used to replace the volatiae portion does not cause the filler particles to agglomierate and result in a filler which will not form optically cl ar compositions. Typically, the actual non volatile solids content of the gelled or fluid hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler containing compositions is in the range of from 5 to 35 percent by weight. Further details concerning the methods of formulating, processing and incorporating hydrophobic reinforcing silica fillers of this type into polydiorganosiloxanes can be found in a United StatesPatent Application entitled Method for ProducingHydrophobic Reinforcing Silica Fillers and Fillers ObtainedThereby to Michaei A. Lutz which is filed concurrently herewith and is assigned to the same assignee as is the present invention, which is hereby incorporated by reference to teach such methods. In addition to the above filler preparation method, any method which will render the silica filler hydrophobic prior to the time when substantially all of the filler particles have aggregated to a particle size which is smaller than about 4,000 Angstroms and which method results in a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler possessing the above described physical characteristics can be used to prepare fillers which may find use in optically clear compositions of the present invention having the above described haze and luminous transmittance values. The filler and one or more polydiorganosiloxanes can be mixed together using mixing apparatus and techniques which are well known in the art such as bread dough mixers, twin screw mixers, two roll mills and the like. The mixing should be as homogeneous as possible to obtain optimum optical clarity. It is very important to operate under conditions which are as free from contamination by foreign materials as possible because dirt and lint seriously increase haze values and decrease luminous transmittance values. It is best to add the silica filler to the polydiorganosiloxane as a wet composition rather than as a dry powder, especially when the silica filler is obtained by the alkaline hydrolysis of an alkyl silicate, particularly methyl orthosilicate. Wet compounding minimizes the formation of large agglomerates, that may be difficult to properly disperse into particles which are sufficiently small primary particles and aggregates thereof to result in optically clear compositions. Once the filler and polydiorganosiloxane have been mixed, various well known means such as heating the mixture to 105 1100C as the mixing operation is continued or heating the mixture under reduced pressure while mixing is continued can be employed to remove the volatile portion of the mixture. It is desirable that the filler be homogeneously mixed with the polydiorganosiloxane pripr to removing the volatile portion of the mixture. Therefore, one preferred method for producing optically clear compositions of the present invention comprises the steps of I mixing 100 parts by weight of at least one polydiorganosiloxane as defined above with a sufficient amount of a wet, gelled filler composition containing from 15 to 120 parts by weight of a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler as defined above to form a mixture and II removing the volatile portion of said mixture to obtain an optically clear composition curable to an elastomer. An alternative preferred method for producing optically clear compositions of the present invention comprises the steps of I mixing 100 parts by weight of at least one polydiorganosiloxane as defined above with a sufficient amount of a wet, fluid filler composition containing a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler as defined above to form a mixture and II removing the volatile portion of said mixture to obtain an optically clear composition curable to an elastomer. Both methods can additionally comprise a third step III of mixing at least one curing agent into the composition. Once the filler and polydiorganosiloxane have been homogeneously blended and any volatiles are removed to form an optically clear composition, the composition can be cured to form an optically clear elastomer. The terms cured and curing as used in describing the present invention include any method which can be used to vulcanize or cross link the polydiorganosiloxanes present in the composition to form optically clear, useful elastomeric products. It is well within the ability of one skilled in the art to select one or more polydiorganosiloxanes which, when mixed with the above described silica fillers, can be cured to form optically clear elastomeric products by such means as electron beam irradiation or ultraviolet light.The compositions can additionally contain one or more curing agents which aid in forming cured elastomeric products possessing the desired haze and luminous transmittance values. Examples of curing agents are organic peroxides which are suitable for vulcanizing silicone rubber such as benzoyl peroxide, tertiarybutyl perbenzoate, 2,4 dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, ditertiarybutyl peroxide, 2, 5 bis t butylperoxy 2,5 dimethylhexane and the like or curing agents which promote the room temperature vulcanization of polydiorganosiloxanes upon exposure to moisture such as the combination of a metal salts of carboxylic acids such as stannous octoate with b a relatively minor amount of an alkyltrialkoxysilane or ethyl orthosilicate where the polydiorganosiloxane comprising 100 parts by weight of the mixture is a hydroxy endblocked polydiorganosiloxane.Other curing agents which promote room temperature vulcanization of polydiorganosiloxanes such as those employing metal catalysts in combination with acetoxyfunctional silanes or acetamido functional silanes can be used as long as useful, optically clear elastomeric products can be obtained. Another useful combination of curing agents is exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 2,823,218 issued February 11, 1958 to Speier et al. and by U.S.Patent No. 3,697,473 issued October 10, 1972 to Polmanteer et al. Both of which patents are hereby incorporated by reference to teach the various types of organosiloxane compounds containing silicon hydride radicals, platinum catalysts, catalyst inhibitors, and vinyl containing polydiorganosiloxanes which can be employed by those skilled in the art to produce the optically clear compositions of the present invention. The Polmanteer patent is also incorporated by reference to illustrate one type of composition which can contain silica fillers which are cured to elastomeric products through the use of curing agents which employ the platinum catalyzed addition of a silicon hydride radical to a silicon bonded vinyl radical.Other methods for curing the optically clear compositions of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The method of curing employed is not critical as long as the resulting product is an optically clear, useful elastomeric product. Surface defects such as fingerprints or those due to mold indentations or scratches on the surfaces of a molded article such as a lens for a gas mask can scatter light and result in a haze value of greater than 4 per 2.54 mm thickness even though the cured elastomer itself has a haze value of less than 4 percent.Therefore, it is preferable to check the optical clarity of a uniform 2.54 mm thickness of the uncured composition to obtain a reliable measure of the haze value and optical transmission value of the compositions. The compositions of the present invention can also include minor amounts of additives such as compounds which promote adhesion to various substrates such as gammaglycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane as taught in U.S. PatentNo. 4,d87,585, issued May 2, 1978, to Schulz or ethyl polysilicate as taught in U.S. Patent No. 3,312,587, issuedApril 4, 1967, to Wilson , heat stability additives, ultraviolet light absorbing compounds, plasticizers, dyes which color, but do not increase the haze value of, the compositions and products, plasticizers and other well known additives provided that such additives do not result in compositions possessing haze values of greater than 4 percent and luminous transmittance values of at least 85 percent per 2.54 mm thickness. The curing of said compositions can be accomplished in any well known manner such as by heating alone, by heating under pressure, mixing a catalyst with the remainder of the composition at room temperature or above, exposing the compositions to the action of moisture or by simply exposing the compositions to radiation in any apparatus or device such as a mold which will result in a cured elastomer having the desired shape. The cured products are silica reinforced silicone elastomers useful as optically clear articles such as lenses for gas masks, interlayers for windshields, clear tubing, optically clear adhesives or sealants, and when the cured elastomer itself is biocompatible with an animal or human body, the elastomers may be used to produce prosthetic devices such as mammary implants, corneal prostheses such as intraocular lenses and contact lenses and the like. The following examples are intended as being merely illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention to those examples alone. The scope of the present invention is properly defined by the appended claims. All parts and percentages reported in the following examples are by weight unless otherwise indicated. In all cases where the surface treated silica fi L Le rs were prepared by the hydrolysis of an alkyl silicate, the silica filler exhibited 100 hydrophobicity according to the water flotation test described in the patent application to Lutz, supra. That is, 100 of a 0.3 g sample of the filler dried on a hot plate at 2500C for 30 minutes floated at the top of 2.5 cc of water after the filler and water were vigorously shaken together. The following polydiorganosiloxanes were used to prepare the compositions described in the examples Gum A A dimethylvinylsiloxy endblocked polyciorgancsiloxane gum consisting essentially of 99.86 mole percent of dimethylsiloxane units and 0.14 mole percent of methylvinylsiloxane units based upon the total moles of diorganosiloxane units present, the ratio of total moles of organic substituents to silicon atoms R Si ratio being about 2.00 and the Williams plasticity 4.2 g sample of Gum A being in the range of 55 65 mils. 1.40 1.65 mm and a refractive index of about 1.403 at 2S0C, Sodium D wavelength this temperature and wavelength was used to obtain all the refractive index values which are hereinafter reported. Gum B A dimethylvinylsiloxy endblocked polydiorganosiloxane gum consisting essentially of 88.5 mole percent cf dimethylsiloxane units, 11.0 mole percent of phenylmethylsiloxane units and 0.5 mole percent of methylvinylsiloxane units based upon the total moles of diorganosiloxane units present, the Williams plasticity of Gum B being in the range of 50 70 mils 1.27 1.78 mm . The R Si ratio was about 2.00 and had a refractive index of about 1.430. Gum C A hydroxy endblocked polydiorganosiloxane gum consisting essentially of 99.5 mole percent of 3,3,3 trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane units and 0.5 mole percent of methylvinylsiloxane units based upon the total moles of diorganosiloxane units present. The Williams plasticity 5.6 g sample of Gum C was 102 mils 2.59 mm and had a refractive index of 1.3803. The R Si ratio was about 2.00. Gum D A dimethylvinylsiloxy endblocked polydimethylsiloxane gum having a Williams plasticity 4.2 g sample in the range of 55 65 mils 1.40 1.65 mm . The refractive index of the gum was about 1.403 and the R Si ratio was about 2.00.Examples 1 8 Examples 1 8 consist of compositions containing a polydiorganosiloxane gum and various types of hydrophobic reinforcing silica fillers which were prepared for the purpose of measuring the luminous transmittance and the haze values of each composition at room temperature about 220 230C according to the procedure described in ASTMD1003 61. Examples 5 8 are comparative examples. The silica filler used in Examples 1 and 2 was prepared by mixing 410 milliliters ml of methanol, 75.4 ml of concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide density 0.9 g inl, 28.4 NH3 content, the symbol means approximately and 30.8 ml of water together at room temperature in a bottle containing a magnetic stirring bar.Then 60 ml of hexamethyldisilazane was added and the mixture was allowed to stir an additional 10 minutes before 120. ml of methyl orthosilicate was rapidly added. The mixture was then allowed to stir at room temperature until the mixture gelled and the magnetic stirring bar stopped.The gelled silica filler containing composition was allowed to age for about three hours after the addition of the methyl orthosilicate before it was used to prepare the composition of Example 1. The resulting wet, gelled filler composition hereinafter Filler Composition I had a theoretical SiO4 2 content of about 8 and contained approximately 15.2 percent by weight of a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler. The composition of Example 1 was prepared by slowly incorporating 165 g of Filler Composition I to 50 g of Gum A using a clean two roil mill. The volatiles were removed by hot milling the mixture for 30 minutes at 1050C 1100C, The mixture was then cooled to room temperature. A sheet of the milled composition was removed from the two roll mill and pressed to a uniform thickness of 1.90 mm 75 mils between two clean 10.16 cm x 10.16 cm x 0.32 cm 4 x 4 x 0.125 , where the symbol is inches plates of glass. Two plates of.clean glass were placed together 0.64 cm thickness and the haze value was found to be 0.6 and the luminous transmittance value was 91.9 . The presence of an air space between the glass plates may affect these values.Some lint or dust particles were observed in the transparent layer as were a small amount of what appeared to be gel particles or filler agglomerates. Example 2 was prepared using 165 g of FillerComposition I which had been aged about 24 hours at room temperature and 40 g of Gum A. The same mixing technique used in Example 1 was employed except the filler composition and gum were milled together without heating the rolls for a longer period of time prior to the devolatization stepjto. insure that the gelled filler was adequately mixed with the gum because the filler composition contained a large amount of liquid. After being pressed between two clean glass plates as above, this composition was visally. observed to contain fewer gel particles than Example 1. The compositions of Examples 3 and 4 were prepared using Filler Composition II which was prepared according to the same procedure employed in preparing Filler CompositionI using the following formulation 425 ml methanol, 94 ml concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide, 4 ml water, 32 g of a solid organosilicon hydrophobing compound consisting principally of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane this was used in place of the hexamethyldisilazane in Filler Composition I and 120 ml methyl orthosilicate. The composition of Example 3 was prepared using 165 g of Filler Composition II which had been aged for twenty four hours at room temperature and 50 g of Gum A. This composition was milled together on a two roll mill and immediately hot milled for 30 minutes at 1050 1100C to remove volatile material. A 1.9 mm sample exhibited approximately the same amount of gel particles as didExample 1. Example 4 was prepared using the same formulation as Example 3, but employed the milling procedure described in Example 2. This composition exhibited fewer gel particles than that of Example 3, but had a slightly higher haze value see Table I . The higher haze value could be due to the presence of more lint or dirt particles in Example 4. However, the examples demonstrate that the filler and gum should be mixed or blended as homogeneously as possible to obtain compositions with optimum optical clarity. The composition of Example 5 was prepared by alternately adding small increments of a total of 3 grams of hexamethyldisilazane and a total of 20 g of a reinforcing silica filler powder reportedly having a surface area of about 255 m2 g Cab O Sils MS 75, product of the Cabct Corporation, Boston, Mass. 02110 to 40 g ofGum A on a cold two roll mill until all of the filler and hexamethyldisilazane was added to the gum. Then 1 g of water was added to the gum filler mixture and it was hot milled for 30 minutes at 1050 1100C to produce a composition containing a surface treated filler which was then pressed between two clean glass plates to a thickness of 1.90 mm. The resulting composition contained about 54 parts of filler solids per 100 parts of Gum A.The amount of filler was estimated by assuming that the original amount of silica added was about 92 of the amount of the treated filler this assumption was also used in reporting the amount of filler in Example 12 . The composition 6 Example 6 was prepared by s o slowly adding 9 g of a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler powder to 30 g of Gum Á on a cold two roll mill.When all the filler was added, the mixture was hot milled 15 minutes at 105 1100C, cooled and pressed between two clean glass plates to a uniform thickness of 2.54 mm. The silica powder used in this Example was prepared according to the general procedure of refluxing 320 ml of a deionized sodium silicate solution calculated to contain the equivalent of 32 g SiO4 2 units , 300 ml of a colloidal silica sol containing 48 g SiO2, 180 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid, 100 ml water and 2 g iron III chloride for 3 hours. After 3 hours, 300 ml isopropanol and 60 ml trimethylchlorosilane were added and the mixture was allowed to stir for one half hour. Then 700 ml of toluene was added and the surface treated silica transfers to the organic toluene phase.The toluene phase containing the silica was recovered, azeotroped to remove water and the silica product obtained from the toluene phase was then dried. The composition of Example 7 was prepared by first stirring 100 g of a reinforcing silica filler powder fume silica which reportedly had a surface area of about 400 r ,m2 g Cab O Sile S 17, a product of the Cabot Corporation., Roston, Mass. 02110 into 1000 g of toluene using a nitrogen purge. The slurry that formed was heated to 600C zand then 20 g of hexamethyldisilazane and 1 g of water was added. The viscosity of the slurry significantly decreased within about three minutes after the addition of the latter two ingredients and the slurry was allowed to stir for an additional 30 minutes after the viscosity change. The slurry was then placed in a flat glass dish and allowed to dry overnight in an air hood.The next day, the remainder of the volatile materials were removed by drying the filler in an air circulating oven at 1250C. Twenty five grams of the resulting filler was compounded with 50 g of Gum A on a two roll mill. After all the filler was added and a cohesive sheet had formed, the composition was hot milled for 30 minutes at 1050 1100C . Then a uniform 2.54 ml thickness of the resulting composition was pressed between two clean glass plates. The composition of Example 8 was prepared by mixing 50 g of Gum A, 5 g of hexamethyldisilazane and 2 g of water together on an unheated two roll mill. Then 25 g of the same type of reinforcing silica filler powder used in Example 7 was slowly added to the above mixture. After all of the filler was added and a cohesive sheet had formed, the composition was hot mil 1td for 30 minutes at 1050 1100C. Then a uniform 2.54 mil thickness of the resulting composition was pressed between two clean glass plates. The luminous transmittance and haze values for each composition were measured using the previously described hazemeter. When 1.90 mm thicknesses were employed Examples 1 5 , the value of the haze at 2.54 mm was calculated for the purpose of comparing all the samples. The haze values reported are the average of four measurements. The results are summarized in Table I.Examples 1 4 gave haze values df less than 4 using polydiorganosiloxane gums where the organic radicals present were primarily methyl radicals and a small percentage of vinyl radicals while Examples 5 8 had haze values of greater than 8 using the same type of gum even though several different filler treatment methods and several different silica fillers were employed.Example 9 Example 9 demonstrates the production of an optically clear composition composed of a fluorinecontaining polydiorganosiloxane gum and a hydrophobic reintorcing silica filler surface treated with fluorine containing organosiloxy units wherein the ref rative index of the gum Gum C R.I. 1.3803 was not closely matched with the refractive index of the filler. The filler used in Example 9 was prepared according to the procedure previously described for FillerComposition I and had the following formulation 88.3 ml methanol, 12.6 ml water, 7.5 ml concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide, 20 ml sym tetramethyl bis 3,3,3trifluoropropyldisilazane and 60 ml methyl orthosilicate.This wet, gelled filler composition was aged for two days at room temperature prior to use, contained 23 filler solids and about 14 theoretical SiO4 2 content based upon the total weight of the filler composition and is hereinafter referred to as Filler Composition III. The composition of Example 9 was prepared using a filler loading level of 55 parts of filler solids per 100 parts of Gum C by employing the milling procedure used inExample 2 to blend 72 g of Filler Composition III with 30 g of Gum C. The filler and gum were adequately mixed because the sample had good optical clarity little noticeable haze at 105 110 C when viewed between the two rollers just prior to being removed from the mill This visual observation was experimentally confirmed because a uniform 1.9 mm thickness of this composition betweentwo glass plates had a luminous transmittance value of 88.0 and a haze value of 2.5 which was calculated to be a haze value of 3.3 for a 2.54 mm thickness.A simple method to predict whether or not the filler and gum have been properly or homogeneously blended and or to estimate whether or not a particular filler composition will result in optically clear compositions is to observe the visual clarity of a sample between the rolls of a two roll mill as it is being milled. If the composition is optically clear at 105 110 C, then it can be expected to have good optical clarity at room temperature. The final test, however, is to instrumentally measure the luminous transmittance and haze value of the composition as described above.Example 10 This example demonstrates the effect of filler loading on the luminous transmittance and haze values of the compositions of the present invention. The filler used in these examples Filler Composition IV was surface treated using a hydrophobe agent prepared by ref fluxing a mixture of 100 g of a solid hydrophobe agent consisting principally of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, 49.5 g of methanol and 0.5 g of an ammonia gas methanol solution 0.11 g NH3 g of solution for 2 hours hereinaft .referred to as Hydrophobe Agent Solution A .The hydrophobit reinforcing silica filler containing compositxon was prepared using the following formulation 111 ml methanol, 45 ml concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide, 51 ml of the ammonia gas methanol solution described above, 54 ml of HydrophobeAgent Solution A and 120 ml of methyl orthosilicate. The filler composition was prepared by mixing the methanol, concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide and ammonia gas methanol solution together and then adding theHydrophobe Agent Solution A. When the last addition was made, the methyl orthosilicate was rapidly added with stirring and the mixture was allowed to stir until gelation took place. The wet, gelled filler composition was then stored about 4 weeks at room temperature prior to use.The wet, gelled filler composition obtained had a solids content of 25.3 . The amounts of Gum A and filler used are tabulated in Table II and each sample was prepared according to the procedure used in Example 4. The luminous transmittance and haze values are for 2.54 mm thick samples. In preparing these samples the last sample containing 90 phg parts of filler solids per 100 parts of gum of filler had the highest viscosity and required more handling in the laboratory to produce a uniform sheet. The sample containing 30 phr did not form a sheet on the two roll mill as well as the others and difficulty was also experienced in preparing a uniform sheet. It has a haze value of greater than 4 and is therefore a comparative example. Additional handling results in the inclusion of more foreign matter such as dust which increases the haze value. A one to two percent difference in haze value between compositions having a similar or identical formulation can be due to the presence of such foreign matter. The sample containing 60 phr appeared to contain an optimum level of filler and was the easiest of the three to handle.It therefore offered the least amount of opportunity for contamination. All of the above samples contained some visible particles of foreign material which can be eliminated when such samples are compounded under optimum conditions of cleanliness such as those conditions used in preparing ophthalmic lenses or medical grade elastomers. This example demonstrates that optically clear compositions can be prepared over a wide range of filler loading levels.Examples 11 12 These examples demonstrate the difference between an optically clear composition which is obtained by matching the refractive index of a gum to that of the silica filler and an optically clear composition of the present invention which doers not require refractive index matching. Example 11 wias prepared by blending 30 g of GumB with 71.1 g of Filler Composition V 18.0 g filler solids on a two roll mill until the sample was well mixed and then the sample was hot milled at 1050 l100C for 15 minutes to remove volatile materials. The composition ofExample 11 contained a filler loading of 60 phr. Filler Composition V employed two hydrophobe agents to surface treat the filler surface and had the following formulation 111 ml methanol, 45 ml concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide, 51 ml of the ammonia gas methanol solution of Example 10, 54 ml Hydrophobe AgentSolution A, 48 drops t0.7 g of a liquid hydrophobe agent consisting principally of 1,3,5 trimethyl 1,3,5 trivinyl cyclotrlsiloxane and 120 ml methyl orthosilicate. FillerComposition V was prepared using the same procedure as that described for Filler Composition IV except that the 48 drops of the liquid hydrophobe agent was added after the addition of the Hydrophobe Agent Solution A and prior to the addition of the methyl orthosilicate.Thus, the hydrophobe agent mixture used to surface treat this filler contained approximately 2 mole percent of methylvinylsiloxane units based upon the total moles of siloxane units contained in both hydrophobe agents to improve the properties of the elastomer obtained upon curing the elastomer composition. The wet, gelled filler composition contained about 14 by weight of theoreticalSiO4 2 units and about 23 filler solids. Example 12, a comparative example, was prepared according to the following general procedure. One hundred parts of Gum B is mixed together with 18.5 parts of hexamethyldisilazane and 4 parts of water in a bread dough mixer. When the mixing is complete, a total of 55 parts of a reinforcing silica filler powder fume silica which reportedly had a surface area of about 400 m2 g Cab O Sils S 17, a product of the Cabot Corporation, Boston, Mass.02110 was incrementally added with mixing over a period of about 2 hours until all the filler was incorporated into the gum. Mixing is then continued as the mixture is heated to 2250C under nitrogen purging. At 225 C, mixing is continued under vacuum conditions for three hours and then the mixture is cooled to room temperature. The resulting composition contained about 60 parts of filler solids per 100 parts by weight of Gum B. A sample of a composition prepared in the above manner was then hot milled on a two roll mill for 15 minutesv,to remove volatile materials before the following evaluations were made. As noted in Example 19 the clarity of the sample can be observed while it is being milled simply by looking between the gap between thewrollers. Since the mill is heated by steam, one can observe the clarity of the sample as it is heated up to about 1500C. The refractive index of a polydiorganosiloxane gum is known to change with temperature. As a sample of an optically clear composition which relies on refractive index matching for its optical clarity is heated, the haze value of the sample should increase as the difference between the refractive index of the gum and filler increases with increasing temperature.This change in haze value is visible to the naked eye and thus the clarity of the compositions of Example 11 and 12 were noted at three temperatures during the hot milling of each sample. The filler and gum compositions prepared above were each placed on a two roll mill at room temperature and the haze of each sample in the gap of the rollers at room temperature was visually rated on a scale of 1 to 6 where a rating of 1 is the visually apparent haze of the composition of Examples 11 3.17 haze value at 2.54 mm thickness and 12 4.9 haze value at room temperature and where a rating of 5 is the visually apparent haze of the composition of Example 8 8.6 haze value at room temperature. The steam was turned on and the sample was hot milled over a period of 15 minutes.The clarity of each sample was visually evaluated when the temperature of the rollers reached about 1050C and again at a temperature of a little more than 1500C. The results are as follows Visual Haze Rating Room Temperature 1050C 1500C Example 11 1 1 2 3 Example 12 1 4 6 As the visual observations demonstrate, the compositions of the present invention have a much lower increase in haze with increasing temperature than a composition which requires refractive index matching of the gum and fume silica filler to obtain optical clarity at room temperature. To further measure the increase in haze, samples consisting of uniform 2.54 mm sheets of each composition pressed between clean glass plates were prepared and the luminous transmittance value and the haze value of each sample was measured at room temperature R.T. . One sample of each composition was placed in a 1000C oven until the temperature of the sample reached 1000C. One sample was then quickly removed from the oven and the luminous transmittance of the sample was measured 30 seconds after being removed from the oven. The haze value measurement was then made and completed 60 seconds after the sample was removed from the oven.Both samples were evaluated in this manner and were believed to be atabout 1000C when the measurements were taken. The reujt s are shown below Luminous Transmittance Haze Value R.t 100 C R.T. 100 C Example 11 88.4 88.2 6 3.1 3.1 Example 12 86.8 84.4 4.9 7.0 The above results show the advantages possessed by compositions of the present invention. The luminous transmittance and haze value of the composition of the present invention Example 11 does not appear to change in a significant manner although the sample Example 12 which relies upon refractive index matching does.This property can be valuable where an optically clear composition is desired for use as an optically clear interlayer in a windshield for a high speed aircraft where the windshield heats up due to the passage of air molecules over the windshield at supersonic speeds.Examples 13 22 These examples demonstrate the variation in physical properties of elastomers obtained by curing compositions of the present invention. The fillers used in these compositions were surface treated to render the filler hydrophobic. A combination of hydrophobe agents was employed wherein the combination was varied to result in a hydrophobe agent containing from 0.5 to 8 mole percent of methylvinylsiloxane units and from 92 to 99.5 mole percent of dimethylsiloxane units. The mole percentages were based upon the total moles of diorganosiloxane units calculated to be initially present in the combination of hydrophobe agents prior to the addition of the methyl orthosilicate.The fillers were prepared using the same procedure and formulation as that employed in Filler Composition V except that the amount of I,3,5 trimethyl l,3,5 trivinylcyclotri siloxane used in each filler composition was as follows Examples 13 and 18 12 drops to0.18 g , Examples 14 and 19 24 drops X0.36 g , Examples 15 and 20 48 drops 0.72 g , Examples 16 and 21 96 drops X1.4 g andExamples 17 and 22 192 drops X2.8 g . Thus, the methylvinylsiloxane content of each filler in mole percent was 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 respectively. The fillers were aged at least 24 hours at room temperature prior to use.The solids content for each filler was determined by heating the filler in a 125 C oven for 2 hours and the average solids content for the five filler containing compositions was 25.3 . To obtain a filler loading level of 60 parts of silica filler solids per 100 parts by weight of polydiorganosiloxane gum used, 71 g of the wet filler composition was added to 30 g of gum. In Examples 13 17,Gum D was used while in Examples 18 22, Gum A was used.The procedure used for each example was t9 place 30 g of gum on a two roll mill at room temperature and then incrementally add a total of 71 g of filler to the gum.When the filler was thoroughly mixed into the gum, milling was continued as the rollers were heated to about 105 110 C. When the mixture became clear, the hot milling was continued for another 15 minutes to devolatilize the mixture. The mill was then cooled to room temperature and 18 drops of 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di t butylperoxy hexane catalyst was added to each sample one part of catalyst per 100 parts of gum . Each sample was pressed into a standard 6.35 cm x 13.97 cm x 0.16 cm molding chase and heat press cured for 15 minutes at about 1700 1750C.The cured elastomers were then post cured by heating them in an oven for 4 hours at 2000C. The average physical properties of the cured elastomers were evaluated using the following ASTM procedures ASTM D412 ultimate tensile stress strength , elongation at break and modulus or tensile stress at 100 elongation and ASTM D2240 durometer. The Trouser Leg.Tear Value of each sample was measured following the method of Greensmith and Thomas as described in Rupture ofRubber III , J. Polymer Science, Interscience Publications,New York, N.Y., 18, pp. 189 206 1955 which is hereby incorporated by reference to teach this method. The value reported is the average of two measurements and is believed to be a more reproducible method of evaluating the tear value of cured elastomers then the more commonly used Die B tear test outlined in ASTM D624. The results are reported in Table IV. When the above compositions are homogeneously blended together and are reasonably free of foreign matter, the compositions are optically clear. The refractive index of a filler having the same formulation as that used inExamples 15 and 19 was found to be 1.428 0.002 and the refractive index of Gum D is about 1.403. A composition having the same formulation as that used Example 17 was prepared according to the mixing procedure employed in Example 4, but was hot milled for 15 minutes at l050 ll00C. This optically clear composition had a luminous transmittance value of 87.1 and a haze value of 2.5 measured using a 2.54 mm thickness of the composition between two sheets of glass.Example 23 In this example, the luminous transmittance and haze values of an elastomer obtained by curing an optically clear composition of the present invention were measured.The optically clear composition used had the same formulation as that of Example 17 and contained the same level of curing catalyst. A sample of this composition was pressed between two sheets of glass in a 10.16 cm x 10.16 cm x 0.16 cm molding chase in a molding press to form a uniform sheet. To provide a uniform molding surface which was as free of surface defects as possible and which was capable of being easily stripped from the surfaces of the cured elastomer, a sheet of tetrafluoroethylene fluorocarbon polymer film Teflons film a registered trademark of E.I. duPont de Nemours, Wilmington, Del.19898 was placed between each glass plate and the optically clear composition such that only the film touched the composition. The heat was turned on and the sample was heated under pressure at a rate of about 5 C per minute until the temperature reached 1700C. The sample was cured at 1700C for 15 minutes and the sample was then cooled to room temperature at the same rate it had been heated. One of the glass plates cracked during the heating and left a hairline impression on the sample, but otherwise the molded sample had an excellent surface. The cured elastomer sheet had an average thickness of about 1.65 mm 65 mils . The haze value of the 1.65 mm sheet itself was 2.5 and the luminous transmittance of the sheet was 93.6 no glass plates were used in making these measurements. The calculated haze value for a 2.54 mm sample is 3.8 which is within the definition of an optically clear cured elastomer of the present invention.A 2.54 mm sheet of cured elastomer of this type could find use as a lens for a protective mask for the face. Example 24 The hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler used in this Example was prepared according to the procedure previously described for Filler Composition II using thefollowing formulation 93.7 ml methanol, 18.6 ml water, 7.5 ml concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide, 18 g of a solid organosilicon hydrophobing compound consisting principally of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane and 60 ml methyl orthosilicate. The resulting wet, gelled, silica filler containing composition contained about 12.5 percent by weight of theoretical SiO4 2 units and contained approximately 24 percent by weight of a hydrophobic reinforcing silica filler hereinafter Filler CompositionVI . To prepare the composition, a sufficient amount ofFiller Composition VI was homogeneously blended withPolymer E on a two roll mill to result in a composition containing 60 parts of filler solids per 100 parts by weight of Polymer E. Polymer E was a methylphenylvinylsiloxy endblocked polydimethylsiloxane having a viscosity at 250C in the range of 1.8 to 2.4 Pas pascal seconds and an average ratio of organic radicals per silicon atom in the range of 2.006 to 2.007. Polymer E had a much lower viscosity than the gums used in the previous examples.Therefore, a small amount of the wet filler composition was added to thicken the Polymer E sample so that it would form a sheet on the two roll mill. The remainder of the we, gelled filler composition was incrementally added and then the composition was hot milled at about 1050 1100C for 30 minutes to remove volatile material. The composition appeared to be very cl ear and free of noticeable haze when viewed between the rolls of the mill. The sample was then cooled to room temperature and the following curing agents were blended into the composition in the following order using the two roll mill to disperse them 2.7 parts ofPolymer F, 0.2 parts of a platinum catalyst solution and 0.07 parts of 2 methyl 3 butyn 2 ol inhibitor compound these parts are parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of Polymer E.Polymer F was trimethylsiloxyendblocked polyorganosiloxane having 37.5 mole percent of dimethylsiloxane units and 62.5 mole percent of methylhydrogensiloxane units where the mole percent is exclusive of the trimethylsiloxy units and having a silicon bonded hydrogen atom content of 0.7 to 0.8 weight percent. The platinum catalyst solution employed was a chloroplatinic acid complex of divinyltetramethyldisiloxane diluted with a sufficient amount of a dimethylvinylsiloxy endblocked polydimethylsiloxane having a viscosity at 250C in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 Paes to provide 0.7 weight percent platinum. When the above composition is homogeneously blended, an optically clear composition is obtained. The above composition was heat press cured in a molding chase for 15 minutes at 1700 1750C. The cured elastomer had the following physical properties durometer Shore A 48, tensile strength 6.34 MPa, elongation at break 530 and modulus at 100 elongation 1.10 MPa.Another sample which was post cured for an additional 4 hours at 2000F after the above heat press cure had the following physical properties durometer Shore A 52, tensile strength 8.27 MPa, elongation at break 450 and modulus at 100 elongation 2. 00 MPa. When the cured elastomer obtained from the above optically clear composition is properly molded, an optically clear elastomer is obtained.
