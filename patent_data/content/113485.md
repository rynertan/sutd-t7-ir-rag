# Method of manufacturing a low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp and low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp manufactured by this method.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp having a discharge envelope sealed in a vacuum tight manner and comprising four substantially parallel co extending glass tube parts 1,2,3,4 , adjacent tube parts 1,2 being connected through a cross coupling 5 to each other so that during operation of the lamp the major part of each of the tube parts 1,2,3,4 as well as the cross couplings 5,6,7 are traversed by the discharge. According to the invention, first a cross coupling 24 is established between a first tube part 20 having a length l₁, which is sealed at one end 20a and comprises at the other end and electrode 22 , and a tube part 18 likewise sealed at one end 18a having a length l₁ l₂, which tube part 18 comprises at its other end an electrode 16 , the tube part 18 being subdivided at 18b into two tube parts, one of which has a length l₁ 26 and the other has a length l₂ 27 , the tube part having a length l₁ 26 being removed by the use in a next cycle, while the remaining coupled tube part is 20,27 are arranged beside a pair 21,28 formed in a corresponding manner and are connected to each other by a cross coupling 29 .
