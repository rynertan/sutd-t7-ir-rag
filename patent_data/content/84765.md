# Apparatus for reeling floating booms, particularly such as are self expanding.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a turntable plate arranged on a platform 1 , there being tube means 6 mounted on the plate such as to form a conical shape with the aid of a bolted joint 7 . To one side of the turntable plate 3 there are arranged on the platform three rollers 12, 13, 14 and on another part thereof there is arranged a feed roller 19 and guide rolls 31, 32 . The roller 29 and guide rolls 31, 32 are adjustable in two planes in relation to the platform 1 . For winding up a boom it is taken between the rolls 31, 32 over the feed roller 29 and over the rollers 12, 13, 14 , where the expansion means are flattened so that the boom is wound up in a flattened condition on the tube means 6 forming the conically shaped winding bobin.
