# Vacuum single filer.

## Abstract
A vacuum single filer is provided for bringing multiple rows of containers 10 into single file at high speeds and over a rela tively short distance. This is accomplished by discharging the containers in inclined rows of three from a slotted dead plate 32 onto a perforate conveyor belt 12 extending over vacu um plenum chambers 40, 48 having slots 120, 124 therein for drawing a vacuum. The slot or slots aligned with the outer most container in each row draws sufficient vacuum to hold the outer container in fixed position and a deflector 106 is used to direct the other containers into alignment behind the outer container and to slide them laterally across the belt as the belt moves them downstream until they are finally brought into single file aligment. An infeed vacuum conveyor 33 cooper with the slotted dead plate 32 to arrange the containers in inclined rows having a precise alignment prior to being picked up by the conveyor belt.
