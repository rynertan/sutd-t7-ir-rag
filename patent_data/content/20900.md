# Sorting devices for collating sheets.

## Abstract
A sorting device for collating face up, face down, simplex and duplex copies outputted from a copier, offset press, or similar device includes a plurality of bins formed from a fixed module 66 and a movable throat plate 68 . The fixed module 66 includes a plurality of side walls 70, 72, 74 oriented in a generally vertical direction. The movable throat plate 68 has a plurality of openings 62 between solid bottom wall members 64 oriented in a substantially horizontal direction. A mechanism shifts the movable throat plate to align the bottom wall members 64 with the side walls to form bins with openings in their bases through which copies can be inserted by a sheet delivery mechanism having paper guide rails 29 which can be aligned with any selected one of the openings in the throat plate.
