# Improvements in or relating to the coupling of dielectric optical waveguides.

## Abstract
A pair of optical fibres 16, 19 which are to be joined are located with their end portions in coupling elements 15, 18 one of which is transparent to light. The coupling elements are located such that the ends of the fibres are in approxi mate alignment. Light is transmitted along one fiber 16 so that it is received by the fibre 19 in the transparent coupling element. Light which is not coupled into the core of the fibre 19 is sensed by a sensor 20 and the relative position of the fibres is adjusted until the level of sensed light is a minimum. The sensing of the light is carried out at positions spaced angularly about the waveguide so that an indication of the direction of any misalignment is obtained. The coupling elements are then secured in this position. The adjustment of the fibres can be carried out using a linear translation stage 10 and a microprocessor 25 which controls the stage 10 in accordance with signals from the sensor 20.
