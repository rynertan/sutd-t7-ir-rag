# Presser foot for a knitting machine.

## Abstract
A presser foot 11 , for a knitting machine having independently operable needles located in opposed needle beds, has a leading portion comprising a member 12 with a smooth surface 27, 28 adapted to contact knitted loops when the presser foot is in use. The forward part 31 of the surface 27, 28 is higher than the rearward part 32 and the two parts have a smooth transition between them. The member 12 is adapted to resist deformation by the forces applied by knitted loops and is so shaped that the forward part 31 which first contacts the knitted loops during relative movement of machine needles and presser foot, in use, is inclined to the direction of said relative movement at an angle less than 35 . The presser foot also has a trailing portion 15 extending rearwardly from the member 12 and being, at the location where it departs from the member 12 , at a level substantially the same as or higher than the level of the rearmost stitch contacting section 27 of the leading portion. The trailing portion 15 is adapted to be resiliently deflected in an upward direction by the forces applied to it, in use, by knitted loops.
