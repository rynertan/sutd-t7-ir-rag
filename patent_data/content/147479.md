## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONA WATER AND DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR SUPPOSITORY USEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is concerned with a drug delivery system primarily intended for, but not limited to, use in an environment which is normally low in available body fluid volume such as the rectal or vaginal cavity. The novel design is particularly suitable for its intended use inasmuch as the water necessary for dissolution of the active ingredients is provided as an integral part of the novel drug delivery system. Drug delivery systems carrying their own water are known in the art and one such device is disclosed in Austral. J. Exp. Biol., 33, 415 to 420, 1955 . This device consists of three compartments confined in a specifically constructed housing and a clamp to hold a semi permeable membrane. The driving force of the device depends on the continual presence of a solution of an osmotically effective red dye solute that exhibits an osmotic pressure gradient against water. The red dye is contained in a partially collapsed rubber compartment and it is separated from a second compartment containing water by a semi permeable membrane. The partially collapsed bag is housed in a glass ampoule, along with a product compartment defined by the space between the bag and one end of the glass ampoule.The distant end of the ampoule defines a water compartment. The ampoule also is provided with a drug release nipple, and in operation when the product compartment is charged with a solution of a product, water in the water compartment moves through the semi permeable membrane into the dye solution increasing its volume in the compartment causing it to expand against the rubber providing the mechanical force necessary to eject the product solution through the nipple. It is immediately evident that this device has certain adverse features that tend to diminish its practical use. For example, the device is difficult to construct into compartments that are essentially free of leaks and because of the fabrication demands of a movable material that necessitates a rigid outer housing.Another inherent disadvantage which prevented its wide acceptance by the medical community is the requirement that the drug be in solution. Such solutions tend to be released from the device by simple leaching they do not permit high concentrations of the product to be embodied within the device they often promote chemical deterioration of the active drug and they do not permit the use of insoluble or poorly soluble drugs. It is an object of this invention to provide a drug delivery system comprising a core of aqueous solubulizing system in a wax housing which melts at body temperature surrounded by a matrix of drug and water dispersible excipients which may also be coated with a semi permeable membrane to modulate release of drug solution. It is a further object of this invention to provide such a system primarily for use in an environment low in body fluid volume such as the rectal cavity. It is also an object of this invention to provide a novel drug delivery system that is simple and easy to construct, that carries its own water, and in which the drug is in solution only after administration of the device.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The drawings are examples of devices of the invention and portions thereof and are not to be construed as limiting.

Other drugs having the same or different physiological activity as those recited above can be employed in drug delivery devices within the scope of the present invention. Drugs can be in various forms, such as uncharged molecules, components of molecular complexes, or nonirritating, pharmacologically, pharmaceutically acceptable salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, borate, acetate, maleate, tartrate, salicylate, etc. For acidic drugs, salts of metals, amines, or organic cations e.g., quaternary ammonium can be employed. Furthermore, simple derivatives of the drugs such as ethers, esters, amides, etc. which have desirable retention and release characteristics but which are easily hydrolyzed by body pH, enzymes, etc., can be employed. The amount of drug incorporated in the drug delivery device varies widely depending on the particular drug, the desired therapeutic effect, and the time span for which it takes the film barrier and matrix material to erode or dissolve. Since a variety of devices in a variety of sizes and shapes are intended to provide complete dosage regimens for therapy for a variety of maladies, there is no critical upper limit on the amount of drug incorporated in the device. The lower limit too will depend on the activity of the drug and the time span of its release from the device. Thus it is not practical to define a range for the therapeutically effective amount of drug to be released by the device. The pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble and or dispersible ingredients of the matrix serves to give the suppository shape and rigidity and to preserve the integrity of the device prior to use. These materials include such as polyethylene glycol, gelatin, starch, lactose, cellulosic derivatives, or the like, materials well known in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition to the drug and waterdispersible agent, the matrix may also contain an absorption promoter or adjuvant such as salicylic acid or derivatives, benzalkonium chloride, sodium glycocholate or the like. If sustained, prolonged or pulsed release characteristics are desired the matrix may also include osmotic active agents such as sodium chloride, mannitol, sucrose or other agent selected from those described in U.S. Patent 3,977,404. In this case the device is coated with a semi permeable film such as cellulose acetate, polyvinyl acetate or ethylenevinyl acetate commonly used in the osmotic delivery systems. Preparation of the novel drug delivery system of this invention requires a two step process preparation of the aqueous core and housing and preparation of the final suppository incorporating the aqueous core. Each is an independent, discrete step and the methods employed for the final step are not dependent on the methods employed for the first step. In preparation of the aqueous cores and its housing, hollow shells composed of any of a variety of water insoluble, low melting 35 370C waxy type material are prepared by either dip coating, such as in hard gelatin capsule manufacture or by spin molding as practiced in plastics fabrication.Housings such as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 are prepared by this process. They are filled with the aqueous media and the ends are sealed by placing the end cap, 2, Fig. 2 in place and applying a small amount of heat to the cap to effect a seal Fig. 2 or by placing a small drop of molten waxy material 3, Fig.3 over the aperture to form a seal Fig. 3 . Alternatively, frozen pellets of the aqueous material, flash frozen by conventional methods, are dip coated while in the frozen state in a molten bath of one of the waxy materials. As an alternative to the frozen pellets of aqueous material, aqueous cross linked polymeric gelatinous pellets, shaped as desired, are dip coated as described above. Examples of such pellets are divalent or trivalent metal alginate gels, sodium borate poly vinyl alcohol gels and neutralized carboxyvinyl polymer gels. In preparing the final suppository form of the drug delivery device of this invention, the aqueous containing cores prepared as described above are coated with a mixture of drug and some water dispersible excipient. In addition, if a controlled release type of preparation is desired, osmotic active agents are included and the whole is finally coated with a semi permeable membrane. In one method, hollow shells having an outer shape and dimensions of conventional rectal or vaginal suppositories, and an inner cavity dimension sufficient to accept one of the aqueous cores described above are prepared. The shells are fabricated from mixtures of drug and a water soluble dispersible ingredient such as polyethylene glycol and typically the drug component represents from 0.1 20 by weight. The open end of the device is sealed at the time of manufacture with a low melting water insoluble waxy material in a manner so as not to cause melting of the aqueous core housing. Alternatively, the hollow shells described above can be prepared from a mixture of drug and gelatin in the form of a telescoping two part shell to permit facile manufacture. The aqueous core and housing may also be encapsulated in a soft gelatin shell containing dispersed drug using conventional techniques for forming soft gelatin capsules. The aqueous core and housing may also be coated with a concentrated aqueous solution containing drug and water soluble polymeric or waxy material by dip coating. Any of the foregoing devices may also include osmotic agents in the drug matrix in which event the shaped device is finally coated with a semi permeable membrane such as cellulose acetate, polyvinyl acetate, ethylene vinyl acetate or the like.
