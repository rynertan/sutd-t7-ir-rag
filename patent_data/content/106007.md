# Low profile jack construction.

## Abstract
A mechanical jack construction is provided comprising a load bearing rack 24, 28 which is adapted to be moved in the vertical plane by an engaging pinion 32 . The pinion is con nected to a lever driven ratchet wheel 50 by means of shear pins 46 . Application of an excessive load to the load bearing rack will result in fracture of the shear pins, disengagement of the pinion from the ratchet wheel and substantially instantane ous lowering of the rack. Such construction lends itself to use in track repair and similar applications in which immediate jack retraction is desired upon engagement of excessive loads.
