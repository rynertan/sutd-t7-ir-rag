# A method for welding with the help of ion implantation.

## Abstract
The invention is a method for welding together two parts with the help of ion implantation. The method comprises weakening the chemical and atomic bonds of the surface and near surface atoms of at least one of the surfaces to be welded together by ion implantation techniques. The ion implanted surface may then be cold or diffusion welded to the surface of the other part using conventional methods. The method is particularly applicable to welding together parts of dissimilar metals normally difficult to affect a satisfactory weld.
