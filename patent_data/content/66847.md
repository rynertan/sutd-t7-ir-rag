# Temperature compensated magnetic damping assembly for induction meters.

## Abstract
The invention provides a magnetic damping assem bly 22 for providing a braking torque on an electro conductive disk 14 of an induction device. A pair of permanent magnets 26, 27 each has an easy axis of magnetization and provides two easy flux paths par allel to the easy axis of magnetization separated by a dead zone. The permanent magnets are juxtaposed about a predetermined space through which the disk rotates such that the easy flux paths are perpendicular to the disk. The permanent magnets are aligned such that the magnetic flux passes twice through the disk in opposite directions. Flux return members 29, 31 are provided adjacent to each of the permanent magnets so as to provide a flux path parallel to the disk and linking the twa easy flux paths of each of the permanent magnets to provide a highly efficient, substantially square mag netic flux loop. One of the flux return members 31 is movable relative to the adjacent permanent magnet so as to provide series adjustment of the damping torque. A temperature sensitive magnetic shunting member ex tends from the north to the south pole, across the dead zone, of each of the permanent magnets so as to provide temperature compensation.
