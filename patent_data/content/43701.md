# Capacity control for a scroll type fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
A scroll type fluid displacement apparatus is disclosed. The apparatus includes a housing. A fixed scroll member fixed ly disposed within the housing and comprises a first end plate means from which a first wrap means extends. An orbiting scroll member also comprises a second end plate means from which a second wrap means extends. Both wrap means interfit at an angular and radial offset to make a plurality of line con tacts to define at least one pair of symmetrical sealed off fluid pockets. The first end plate means is formed with two holes which are placed at the symmetrical position. A valve means controls the passage of fluids through the holes. The valve means is controlled by the changes of the external environ ment. The capacity of compressor can thereby be easily changed in response to the changes in the external environ ment.
