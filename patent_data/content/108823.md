## Description
PRODUCTION OF METALLIC MATERIAT WITIl ET,ECTRODEPOSITED COATINGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method of providing metallic material with an electrodeposited coating for use in working, such as pressing, stamping etc. It is the recent trend that metallic material, particularly steel sheet to be worked through pressing, stamping and so on is coated with a lubricative coating by means of dip coating, etc., prior to being subjected to working.Such coating serves to lubricate the metal surface while it is subjected to forming. Such coating is also effective to keep metallic material, particularly metal sheets in a stack from slipping and falling down. Many processes for preparing such coating, therefore, have been proposed and are in development. For use in working metallic materials, lubricants such as mineral oils, animal oils, vegetable oils and synthetic lubricants e.g., synthetic esters with or without an oiliness improver, an extreme pressure additive, etc. have been known in the art. However, they all have a disadvantage in that galling or scoring of the pressed articles is inevitable during working. Soda soap and water soluble soap which comprises sodium borate or the like as its major component are also used as a lubricant. However it is sometimes difficult to cover the newly developed metal surface completely with them during working, and incomplete covering leads to pressing flaws. Thus, a metal blank with such lubricant has less formability. Japanese Patent Publication No. 22948 1977 discloses a lubricant comprised of a mixture of a resin component with wax or fatty esters,etc. It is rather difficult to apply this type of lubricant in a thin and uniform layer.However, if applied in a thick layerr the lubricant easily adheres to the surface of the die or punch and forms deposits thereon. Japanese Patent Publication No. 29819 1980 discloses a dual layer lubricative coating in which a liquid lubricant fats and oils, for example or a solid lubricant graphite, for example is applied over an organic resin film which has been previously placed on the metal substrate. However, this dual layer coating type lubricant is expensive, since it is necessary to carry out hot air drying and then bake hardening at a temperature of 1000C or higher after the application thereof. In addition, a coating of fats and oils develops an unpleasant odor and the coated surface becomes sticky and rough. Many methods for application of coating are known to those skilled in the art, including brushing, roll coating, dip coating, spray coating, curtain flow coating and soon.All these prior art processes, however, have a common disadvantage in that it is quite difficult to control application of the lubricant precisely so as to make the coating thin and uniform. Usually, therefore, it is preferable to employ an electrodeposition coating process for such purpose.According to the electrodeposition coating process, a shearing stress is applied to the surface of the metal being treated, since the speed at which the steel sheet travels through the electrodeposition bath is very high.In addition, when the composition of the coating is comprised of a mixture of two or more components such as a resin and a lubricant which have different electrbphbresis properties, it is sometimes difficult to obtain a coating having the intended properties, because the composition i.e., resin to lubricant ratio of the resulting coating differs much from that of the electrodeposition bath.This difference in composition between the electrodeposition bath and the coating becomes greater when such strong shearing stress as mentioned above is applied to the surface of the metal.OBJECT OF THE INVENTION An object of this invention is to provide a method of providing a metallic material with an electrodeposition coating free from scoring and pressing flaws during working. Another object of this invention is to provide an easier but practical method of providing a metallic material with electrodeposition coating, which can be handled quite easily. Still another object of this invention is to provide a method of providing a metallic material with a thin and uniform coating having a predetermined composition. SUNUIARY OF THE INVENTION The inventors of this invention found that in the cases where electrodeposition coating is continuously applied onto metallic material in an electrodeposition bath comprising an alkaline solution soluble resin, a solid lubricant and water to provide coating with intended properties, there is a close relationship among the concentration of the solid lubricant in the solids of the bath, the electrodeposition treating time and the travelling speed of the metallic material through the bath. The inventors of this invention also found that in order to prevent scoring or the formation of pressing flaws during pressing, stamping, etc, it is desirable to employ an electrodeposition bath containing two specific components in amounts each within certain ranges. Thus, in its broad aspect, this invention resides in a method of applying electrodeposition coating onto metallic material by continuously passing the metallic material through an electrodeposition bath comprising an alkaline solution soluble resin, a solid lubricant and water, characterized in that tEle nath temperature is not lower than 350C, the bath voltage applied is not lower than 60 V and the electrodeposition is carried out under the conditions defined by the following equation aB bT cS 3 1 a 0.40 0.70, b 0.50 1.00 and c 0.010 0.020 wherein, B stands for the weight percent of the solid lubricant based on the solids content of said electrodeposition bath T stands for the electrodeposition treating time in seconds and S stands for the travelling speed in meters per minute m min of the metallic material through the electrodeposition bath.The term speed used herein means the travelling speed of the metallic material relative to the electrodeposition bath which may flow countercurrently. In a preferred embodiment, the solids of the electrodeposition bath used in this invention desirably consist essentially of the following alkaline solution soluble resin and solid lubricant A Alkaline solution soluble resin The alkaline solution soluble resin is a salt, preferably amine salt or ammonium salt, of a copolymer having a glass transition temperature of from 100C to 350C and a number average molecular weight of 5,000 to 50,000, the copolymer comprising 5 30 by weight of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or a mixture thereof and 70 95 by weight of an acrylate or methacrylate ester of a monovalent aliphathic alcohol C1 Cg or a mixture thereof. The alkaline solution soluble resin comprises 40 95t by weight of the solids content of the bath. B Solid lubricant The solid lubricant comprises 5 60 by weight of the solids content and is water dispersible organic metal soap having a particle size of 0.1 to 10p. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 shows a graph obtained by plotting experimental data of coating weight and its calcium strearate content with respect to the indicated travelling speed of the metallic sheet and Figure 2 is a graph showing the relationship between the limiting drawing ratio and the calcium strearate content of the coating.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Important properties to be considered on the coated metallic material prepared in accordance with this invention include the resistance to scoring or galling and drawability. The scoring or galling of the metal surface of the pressed articles is caused by metal to metal contact which is sometimes found during pressing. In order to prevent such contact, a resin layer should be placed between metal surfaces. However, if the sotnin point of the resin 25 low, the resin layer easily tears down during pressing to give metal to metal contact which causes the scoring or galling. Furthermore, when the metal sheets are stacked, the metal surfaces easily adhere to each other.If the adhesion between the coating and the metal surface is not good, the coating sometimes peels off upon working. The fragments of the thus peeled off coating deposit on the surface of die, punch and the like, causing the formation of pressing flaws during working. In order to improve drawability, it is preferable to employ a resin having a lower softening point. However, on the other hand, as mentioned above, a resin having a low softening point has many disadvantages for the purposes of this invention. It is therefore, impractical to select a resin having a softening point which is low enough to improve drawability of a metal sheet to be electrodeposited in accordance with this invention. Thus, according to this invention, metal soap is incorporated in the coating applied to the metal surface to improve drawability.In general, it is necessary to incorporate the metal soap in the electrodeposited coating in an amount of at least 2 by weight, preferably from 3 to 5 by weight. As previously mentioned elclctroclct osition coating is the most suitable method to achieve continuous application of a uniform and thin coating onto the surface of a metal substrate at a high speed. However, when the coating is comprised of two components, i.e.,a resin and a metal soap, it is often experienced that the ratio of resin to metal soap of the coating significantly differs from that of the electrodeposition bath. For example, if the ratio of resin to soap is adjusted to 97 3 in the bath, the resulting coating contains metal soap in an amount of far less than 3 by weight, particularly in the case of high speed electrodeposition.Therefore, to ensure getting the predetermined amount of metal soap in the resulting coating, it is necessary to add the metal soap to the bath in an amount much larger than the desired amount set for the coating. The electrodeposition bath of this invention comprises an alkaline solution soluble resin, a solid lubricant and water. The bath temperature is 350C or higher.When it is lower than 350C, metal soap as solid lubricant does not adhere to the metal surface uniformly, sometimes resulting in indentation flaws during working. The bath voltage, i.e. the voltage applied during operation is desirably 60 V or higher, preferably 8Q V or higher. When the voltage is lower than 60 V, the electrodeposition efficiency is lowered and it is impossible to obtain a coating of the necessary weight through a short high speed treatment according to this invention. Furthermore, according to this invention the metallic material is treated under the conditions defined by the following equation aB bT cS 3 a 0.40 0.70, b 0.50 1.0 and c 0.010 0.020 wherein, B stands for the weight percent of the solid lubricant based on the solids content of the electrodeposition bath, T stands for the electrodeposition treating time in seconds, and S stands for the travelling speed in meters per minute m min of the metallic material through the electrodeposition bath. The factors, a, b, c, are determined taking into consideration the bath temperature, bath voltage and so on at which the electrodeposition of this invention is carried out.The above equation has been derived on the basis of the recognition that the concentration of lubricant has influence, as mentioned above, on drawability of the resulting metallic material and that the treating time as well as the travelling speed of metallic material should also be taken into consideration in order to determine the conditions under which the given amount of lubricant may be incorporated in the resulting electrodeposition coating. Further explanation in this respect will be found hereinafter. The alkaline solution soluble resin to be employed in in this invention is preferably derived from I 5 30 by weight of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or a mixture thereof and II 70 95 by weight of an acrylate ormeth acrylate ester of a monovalent C1 C8 aliphatic alcohol or a mixture thereof. Examples of the ester include methyl acrylate MA , ethyl acrylate EA , n butyl acrylate BA , isobutyl acrylate IBA , 2 ethylhexyl acrylate EHA , methyl methacrylate MMA , ethyl methacrylate EMA , n butyl methacrylate BMA , isobutyl methacrylate IIiA 1 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate EHMA , and the like.Other monomers such as acrylate or methacrylate esters of higher alcohols e.g., stearyl acrylate and methacrylate and hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate e.g., hydroxyethyl or hydroxypropyl methac rylate may be incorporated in the resin in minor amounts in order to modify the properties of the resin. When the acid monomer I is less than 5 by weight, the water dispersibility of the resulting resin is low and it is rather difficult to remove the coating by sub sequent alkali degreasing and cleaning. Furthermore, the coating cannot be applied uniformly onto the metal sur face. On the other hand, when the acid monomer I is present in an amount of more than 30 by weight, the number of carboxyl groups in the resin increases so much that it takes a long time to finish film formation. This is not desirable from a practical viewpoint. The glass transition temperature of the resulting resin which is a copolymer of monomers I and II is preferably from 10 C to 35 C, more preferably from 10 C to 350C. When the glass transition temperature is lower than l00C, metal to metal contact easily occurs during working, resulting in galling. On the other hand, when the glass transition temperature is higher than 350C, friction between the metal die and the coating becomes great, frequently resulting in peeling of the coating. The number average molecular weight of the resin is preferably in the range of from 5,000 to 50,000. When the molecular weight is less than 5,000, the coating has a strong tendency to adhere to the die surface. This has been confirmed by the results of die scoring test. When the molecular weight is more than 50,000, the resulting resin has poor solubility in water which is not enough to ensure that uniform coating is formed. In addition, such resin may not be thoroughly removed by degreasing and cleaning after pressing. The resin to be used in this invention which is soluble in an alkaline solution and which may be either water soluble or water dispersible, may be prepared by any one of the usual polymerization methods, such as solution polymerization, emulsion polymerization, etc.When the solution polymerization is employed to prepare the resin, said monomers I and II in a hydrophilic solvent are kept at a temperature of 50 1500C for 2 8 hours in the presence of an initiator. The aqueous solution or dispersion of the resin thus formed is then neutralized with a saturated short chain alkyl amine or aqueous ammonia to pH 6 9 in a conventional manner to form a salt of the resin prior to use. In general the solution or dispersion for use in preparing an electrodeposition bath contains the resin at a concentration of from 208 to 50t by weight. The hydrophilic solvent useful as a polymerization medium includes C1 C4 alcohols, preferably isopropyl alcohol. The initiator may be conventional one such as benzoyl peroxide or 2,21 azobisisobutyronitrile. Examples of the amine used in neutralization include monoethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tributylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine and the like. When emulsion polymerization is employed, a small amount of a surfactant may be added. However, when the surfactant is used in excess, then the film forming properties of the resin and adhesion of the electrodeposited coating to the metal surface are sometimes impaired, so care should be taken to ensure that the surfactant is not added in excess. The metal soaps which can be used in this invention include alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium, barium and magnesium salts of a C12 C22 higher fatty acid such as lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid or the like. The appropriate particle size of the metal soap mainly depends on the thickness of coating desired and it is usually in the range of from 0.1 to loij, preferably from 3 to 7p. When the particle size is less than 0.1 , a stable dispersion may not be obtained. On the other hand, when the particle size is more than 10p, a rough surface is obtained resulting in dents when drawing. Furthermore, a particle size of more than 10 adversely affects the subsequent alkali cleaning step con ducked after working, resulting in incomplete removal of the coating.The metal soap is added in an amount of 5 GO bv weit based on the total solids content of the electrodeposition bath. Of course, the amount of the metal soap should be selected so as to satisfy the foregoing equation 1 as previously described. After electrodeposition, if necessary, the metallic material is washed with water and dried. The metallic material to be treated in accordance with this invention includes not only sheets, strips and plates, but also wires and the like. As is apparent from the foregoing, this invention is based on a close relation found among such parameters as treating time, travelling speed of the metallic material and concentration of the solid lubricant metal soap .More particularly this invention is characterized by suitably selecting the amount of the solid lubricant to be incorporated in the electrodeposition bath in correlation with the travelling speed and the treating time so as to satisfy the equation 1 mentioned hereinbefore.These conditions ensure that a desired amount of the solid lubricant is incorporated in the resulting electrodeposited coating. This invention will be described in conjunction with the working examples, which are presented merely for illustration and are not as restrictive of this invention at all. In the examples all the parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.Example 1 Aqueous solutions of various water soluble resins were prepared in the following manner. The monomers used were acrylic acid AA , methyl acrylate MA , stearyl acrylate SA , 2 ethylhexyl acrylate EHA , butyl methacrylate BMA , isobutyl methacrylate IBMA , 2 ethyihexyl methacrylate EHMA , stearyl methac rylate SMA , hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA , hydroxy propyl methacrylate HEMA and methyl methacrylate MMA and they were used in the proportions indicated in Table 1 below. The aqueous solution of Resin No. 1, for example, was prepared by reacting a mixture of 210 parts of methyl acrylate, 60 parts of methyl methacrylate and 30 parts of acrylic acid in 75 parts of isopropyl alcohol for about 4 hours under reflux of the alcohol solvent in the presence of 2.7 parts of 2,2 azobisisobutyronitrile as a catalyst.The isopropyl alcohol was then distilled off in vacuo and the residue was neutralized with 21 parts of diethylamine and 661 parts of water to give an aqueous resin solution of about 30 solids content. The aqueous solutions of Resin Nos. 2 through 16 were likewise prepared. The amount of diethylamine used for neutralization, however, was varied depending on the acrylic acid content of the solution. The glass transition temperature and the number average molecular weight of each resin obtained are also included in Table I. To 100 parts of each aqueous resin solution thus obtained was added 300 parts of water to provide an electrodeposition bath of about LO solids content, which was subjected to an electrodeposition test. In the electrodeposition test a cold rolled steel sheet 0.8 mm thick was degreased and subjected to electrodeposition using the sheet as an anode. The electrodeposit ion was carried out in a stream of the bath flowing at high velocity to simulate continuous electrodeposition coating. The following conditions were employed in the electrodeposition distance between electrodes, 100 mm anode to cathode ratio, 1 1 temperature, 350C travelling speed of the sheet, 1 m min. Electric current was passed for 10 seconds with applied bath voltage of 40 80V. The travelling speed of the steel sheet relative to the bath was 10 m min. The electrodeposited steel sheet was then rinsed with water and dried prior to weighing. The weights of the coatings obtained at various applied voltages are summarized in Table 2 below, from which it can be seen that the higher the applied voltage, the heavier the coating weight and that an adequate coating weight cannot be obtained unless the applied voltage is 60V or higher. Next, a similar electrodeposition test was carried out under the same conditions as above except that electric current was passed for 1, 2 or 3 seconds with applied voltage of 80V. The results are summarized in Table 3 below, from which it can be seen that in order to obtain an increased coating weight the electrodeposition should be conducted for a prolonged period of time.

Resin Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11 and 15 prepared above, which were found to have particularly good initial film forming properties, were used to provide a lubricative coating through electrodeposition using an electrodeposition bath containing the resin as an alkaline solution soluble resin and calcium stearate as a solid lubricant. The electrodeposition bath was prepared as follows.In a grain mill 75 parts of calcium stearate particle diameter, 2 25it were dispersed in 500 parts of the aqueous resin solution of about 30 solids content obtained above for 5 hours and 77 parts of the resulting calcium stearate containing dispersion were mixed with 233 parts of the same aqueous resin solution as used above and 690 parts of water to give 1000 parts of a dispersion of 10 solids content containing 1 calcium stearate having a particle diameter of 0.1 10p. From the aqueous solution each of Resin Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11 and 15, a dispersion of 10 solids content was prepared in the manner mentioned above and used as an electrodeposition bath. The electrodeposition was carried out in the same way as described hereinbefore under the following conditions distance between electrodes7 100 mm anode to cathode ratio, 1 1 bath voltage of 80 V and steel sheet travelling speed relative to the electrodeposition bath, 10 mjmin. The actual travelling speed of the steel sheet itself was 1 m min. Electric current was passed for 2 seconds, that is, the electrodeposition was continued for 2 seconds. The electrodeposited test piece thus obtained was subjected to various performance tests. The test results are shown in Table 4 given below.

The testing and eveluation methods which were employed to obtain these experimental data are outlined below.i Test for resistance to die flawing Ironing was carried out at a high working rate with a crank press in order to determine galling of the metal surface. Galling during ironing was determined by measuring the area of the vertical wall portion free from galling on the tenth of ten test blanks which were worked under the same conditions. The symbol O indicates that over 90 of the vertical wall area of the test piece was free from galling. The symbol Z2 indicates that 80 90 of the area was free from galling. The symbol X indicates that less than 80 of the area was free from galling. In addition, the amount of coating remaining after ironing was visually determined in the following manner.The vertical wall area of the test piece was covered with a grid pattern comprising 50 squares 5mm x 5mm . Then the number of squares where the coating remaining after ironing out of the total 50 squares was counted. The symbols indicate the proportion of coating remaining on the metal surface of the inspected area as follows 0 , more than 80 , 70 80 X , r less than 70 . ii Test for cylindrical drawability Punching was carried out at a retaining pressure of 1000 kg cm2 using a punch 33.0 mm in diameter to determine the maximum blank diameter which can be drawn without breaking the blank. The limiting drawing ratio can be given by the following equation Maximum blank diameter which Limiting Drawing Ratio LDR can be drawn sUccessfully Punch diameter The limiting drawing ratio was determined for a coated metal blank LDRC and for a noncoated metal blank LDRn . The cylindrical drawability is indicated in terms of the ratio of LDRC to LDRn shown by the following symbols X , not more than 1.0 A , 1.0 1.1 O , over 1.1. iii Test for stacking properties Two 50 x 50 mm test pieces having surfaces coated in accordance with this invention were placed together with the coated surfaces being kept in face to face contact.A plurality of such sets of two pieces were kept at a temperature of 500C under pressure of 67 kg cm2 for 1 minute and then at 400C at 500 g m2 for 16 hours. After that the test pieces were subjected to aging at room temperature at 500 g m2 for 50 days. In this example, stacking properties are indicated in terms of adhesiveness of the coating. The degree of difficulty required to separate is indicated by the following symbols 0, no difficulty A , some difficulty X , great difficulty strong adhesion.iv Degreasing test Coated test pieces were subjected to alkali cleaning, in which an alkali cleaning medium of a 2 solution of Fine Cleaner 4336 tradename of Nihon Parkerizing K.K. was sprayed against the metal surface at a pressure of 1 kg cm2 at 60 70 C for 5 seconds. The extent to which the cleaned surface repelled water is indicated by the following symbols 0 , no water repellence n , water was repelled to some extent X , the entire metal surface repelled water.Example 2 In this example, Resin Nos. 1 and 2 which were demonstrated to have satisfactory performance in all the properties tested in Example 1 were used to prepare dispersions each containing the resin and calcium stearate in the same manner as described in Example 1. A series of experiments was carried out using these dispersions as an electrodeposition bath. The electrodeposit ion was carried out at various steel sheet travelling speed under generally the same conditions as inExample 1. Electric current was passed for 2 seconds at a bath voltage of 80 V. In this example, the travelling speed means that of the steel sheet to be treated relative to the electrodeposition bath, since the steel sheet was placed in the bath and the dispersion which served as the electrodeposition bath was circulated through the bath at the indicated speed. The coating weight was determined and the calcium stearate content of the coating was also determined by means of fluorescent X ray analysis. The results are summarized in graphs of Fig. 1. The drawability of the thus obtained coated metal sheet is shown in Fig. 2. As is apparent from the data shwon therein, when the calcium stearate content of the coating exceeds 3 , the drawability is improved significantly.And, when the calcium stearate content exceeds 5 , the improvement in drawability is nearly saturated.Example 3 Another series of experiments was carried out in order to determine processing conditions which ensures that the coating applied onto the metal surface always contains 3 or more of calcium stearate. These experiments were carried out under various conditions using an electrodeposition bath containing various amounts of calcium stearate. The resulting test results were analyzed by means of multiple regression analysis, and the following equation was derived from these data showing that the desired coating can be obtained successfully as long as the processing conditions follow the relation aB bT cS 3 a 0.40 0.70, b 0.50 1.0 and c 0.010 0.020 The meanings of B , and are as defined hereinbefore. The concentration of the solid lubricant in the elec trodepos it ion bath is in the range of 5 60 by weight based on the solids content of the bath, and the travelling speed at which the metallic material passes through the electrodeposition bath is generally in the range of 10 140 m min. The factors, a, b, c, in the above equation may be determined depending on other processing conditions including bath temperature, bath voltage and so on. Usually, they take a 0.55, b 0.75 and c 0.015. The following are two typical examples of the experimental data obtained in this example Electrodeposition conditions Case I Case II Travelling Speed of Steel Sheet 30 m min 120 m min Calcium Stearate Concentration of Bath Based on Total Solids 6 10 Treating Time 4 sec 1 sec Coating Weight 17 mg dm2 19 mg dm2 Calcium Stearate Content of Coating 4.2 4.9
