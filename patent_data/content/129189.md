# Renin inhibitors containing a C terminal amide cycle and compositions and combinations containing the same.

## Abstract
Disclosed are renin inhibitory peptides of the formula CHEM wherein A is, e.g., hydrogen B is, e.g., absent glycyl or sarcosyl D is, e.g., absent or S E is, e.g., absent or CHEM where R 6 is e.g., hydrogen C1 4alkyl or aryl F is absent or glycyl R 3 is e.g., C3 6alkyl C3 7cycloalkyl aryl or C3 7cycloalkyl or aryl substituted R 4 is hydrogen or CHEM where R 7 is hydrogen C1 4alkyl hydroxy or C3 7cycloalkyl and R 6 is as defined above R 5 is, e.g., hydrogen or CHEM where R 6 and R 7 are as defined above m is 1 to 4 n is 0 to 4 and wherein all of the asymmetric carbon atoms have an S configuration, except for those in the A, B and D substituents, which may have an S or R configuration and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Those compounds and compositions and combinations containing the same inhibit renin and are useful for treating various forms of renin associated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism.
