# Method for making balanced low shrink tension polyolefin film.

## Abstract
Biaxially oriented, balanced, low shrink tension, heat shrinkable polyolefin film having a shrink percent of at least 7 in both MD and TD at 110 C and a shrink force of not greater than 2.2 MPa in both MD and TD at 110 C is produced by a sequential hot cold hot cold treatment of ordinary biaxially oriented, balanced, heat shrinkable polyolefin film where the film is stretched and relaxed, respectively in the two hot stages of the treatment sequence.
