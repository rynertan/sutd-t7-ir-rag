# SOAP DISPENSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A liquid soap dispensing system includes a closed soap container having a manually actuated dispensing pump carried therebeneath, the container being separated by a partition into a lower soap reservoir and an upper re fill compartment, the latter adapted to enclose therein a removable refill catridge. The cartridge has an outlet neck closed by pierceable membrane recessed therein and adapted to be received into a well in the partition in sur rounding relationship with a hollow tubular piercing mem ber which pierces the membrane and is dimensioned to accommodate free flow of liquid soap therethrough from the cartridge to the reservoir. The cartridge is semirigid and has guide surfaces engageable with positioning mem bers in the refill compartment for guiding and positioning the cartridge therein. A twist off cap opens a vent aperture in the cartridge while a vent tube vents the reservoir. A slot in the wall of the refill compartment prevents the accumu lation of free liquid soap therein.
