# EXPRESSION OF CELL WALL DEGRADING PROTEINS AND HOST CELLS HARBORING DNA ENCODING SUCH PROTEIN

## Abstract
A cell wall lytic enzyme is expressed in recombinant host cells without cell toxicity. The enzyme may be released at a predetermined point by a freeze and thaw cycle. This allows the expressed enzyme to act on the host cell walls and lyse the cells, thereby facilitating recovery of the enzyme or other intracellular products.
