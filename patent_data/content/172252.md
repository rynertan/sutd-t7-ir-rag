# METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR COVERING WELD ZONE OF VERTICAL WALL OF WELDED CAN WITH RESIN TAPE.

## Abstract
A method of and an apparatus for covering with a resin tape a weld zone of a vertical wall of a can and a metal exposed portion on the inner side of a neighboring portion of the weld zone. Resin tapes are held on a plurality of mandrels 36 fixed to a rotary member 12 , and a vertical wall of the welded can is fitted around each mandrel so that the weld zone and the resin tape are opposed to each other. The weld zone is then subjected to a series of heating steps to paste the resin tape on the weld zone accurately in a short period of time.
