## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN SELF ENERGISING DISC BRAKES This invention relates to self energising disc brakes of the kind in which rotatable friction discs provided with linings of friction material are adapted to be brought into engagement with spaced opposed braking surfaces in a housing by pressure plates located between the friction discs and centred by stationary pilot lugs, balls or rollers are located in co operating oppositely inclined recesses in the adjacent faces of the pressure plates, and the application of the brake is initiated by moving the pressure plates angularly in opposite directions, the pressure plates then moving apart, due to the tendency for the balls or rollers to ride up ramps defined by the edges of the recesses, and into engagement with the friction discs which are urged into engagement with the braking surfaces, and the pressure plates are carried round with the friction discs until one is arrested by the engagement of a lug on the plate with a drag taking stop abutment in the housing, the continued angular movement of the other pressure plate providing a servo action. Self energising brakes of the kind set forth may be dry or they may be of the liquid cooled type, and such brakes are commonly used in tractors and like vehicles and are hereinafter called brakes of the kind set forth. It is known to actuate brakes of the kind set forth hydraulically for normal service braking. In one known construction the pressure plates are moved angularly in opposite directions by means of an hydraulic actuator which is located within the housing and comprises a cylinder body having a longitudinal through bore of which the axis is tangential to the plates and in which work a pair of opposed pistons for co operation at their outer ends between lugs on the pressure plates. In such a known construction the axis of the bore also lies in a transverse plane parallel to the plane of each pressure plate. Thus substantially major proportions of the brake applying forces applied to the plates are applied in the direction of the said plane. According to our invention, in a self energising disc brake of the kind set forth the brake is operated hydraulically for normal service braking by means of a hydraulic actuator which is located within the housing and acts between lugs on the pressure plates, and the actuator comprises a cylinder body having a longitudinal bore in which works at least one piston cooperating with an adjacent one of the lugs, the axis of the bore being tangential to the plates and the line of action of the force from the piston to the respective lug lying in a plane which is angled with respect to a transverse plane parallel to the plane of each plate. Angling the line of action of the force facilitates brake application and stability since the brake applying force is applied to the plates with a radial component When the line of action of the force is angled in a direction which facilitates axial separation of the plates, the degree or extent of angling is matched to the inclination of the ramps defined by the edges of the recesses, thereby increasing efficiency, since a direct thrust is applied along the line of movement of the plates it may be necessary, in such a case, to control the tolerance of the pilot lugs within fine limits in order to ensure adequate stability of the brake. Hence an additional machining operation may be required. When the line of action of the force acts in a direction to tend to urge the plates axially towards each other, stability is achieved with the usual tolerances of the pilot lugs and no additional machining operation is therefore necessary. The angling of the line of action of the brakeapplying force may be achieved by angling the axis of the longitudinal bore itself to lie in the said angled plane, or by angling the abutment face on the lug with which the piston co operates. The cylinder body may be fixed to the housing with a pair of opposed pistons working in the bore in the body which extends through the body, the pistons acting between the lugs. In such a construction the body may be carried by, or integral with, a mounting plate which is detachably mounted on the housing and forms a closure for a radial opening through which the cylinder body extends into the housing. This facilitates and simplifies construction since the actuator can be removed from the brake and replaced simply by the removal from the brake and subsequent replacement of at least two securing bolts. The mounting plate and the actuator may be combined with a mechanical mechanism for applying the brake manually for parking or in an emergency. The mechanical mechanism, although so combined, may project into the housing through a second radial opening, spaced angularly from the first. Preferably, however, the mechanical mechanism is actuated from the exterior of the housing by means which project into the brake with the hydraulic actuator, through a common radial opening. This facilitates machining on existing transfer lines, and allows more choice of a position in which the input forces are applied to the brake. Some embodiments of our invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an end view of a portion of a spreading brake Figure 2 is a section on the line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a section on the line 3 3 of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 1 of a modified brake Figure 5 is a section on the line 5 5 of Figure 4 Figure 6 is a view similar to Figure 2 but showing a modification and Figure 7 is a view similar to Figure 6 but showing yet another modification. The brake illustrated in Figures 1 3 of the drawings is of a conventional spreading type in which two rotatable friction discs 1, 2 provided with friction linings and splined on a shaft are adapted to be brought into engagement with spaced opposed radial braking surfaces in a housing 4 by pressure plates 5, 6 located between the discs 1 and centred by three angularly spaced stationary pilots 7, 8, 9. Balls 10 are located in co operating oppositely inclined recesses 3 in the adjacent faces of the pressure plates 5, 6. The application of the brake is initiated by moving the pressure plates 5, 6 angularly in opposite directions which causes the pressure plates 5, 6 to move axially relatively away from each other due to the tendency for the balls 10 to ride up ramps 11 defined by the end faces of the recesses 3. This urges the friction discs 1, 2 into engagement with the braking surfaces in the housing 4. The pressure plates 5, 6 are then carried round with the discs until one is arrested by the engagement of a lug 5a, 6a on a respective plate 5, 6 with a drag taking abutment constituted by the pilot 9, whereafter continued angular movement. of the other plate, known as the 2servo plate , provides a servo action. The housing 4 comprises a first member 15 in the form of a casting comprising an end wall 16 of which the inner face constitutes one of the radial braking surfaces, and an integral, axially extending, annular flange 17 constituting a radial wall. The open face at the free end of the flange 17 is closed by an end plate, not shown, which is bolted to the member 15 by angularly spaced bolts. A radial opening 20 in the flange 17 provides a mounting for an hydraulic actuator 22 by means of which the brake is adapted to be applied hydraulically. As illustrated, the hydraulic actuator 22 comprises a cylinder 24 having an open ended longitudinal through bore in which work a pair of oppositely acting pistons 26, 27 for engagement with lugs 28 and 29 on the plates 5, 6. A pressure space defined in bore between adjacent inner ends of the pistons 26 and 27 is connected to a master cylinder through a passage 32, and a bleed passage 33 also leads from the pressure space The cylinder 24 is integral with the inner end of a spigot 34 which depends from a mounting plate 35.The plate 35 closes the opening 20 and is detachably secured to the flange 17 by at least two circumferentially spaced bolts 36. The longitudinal axis 37 of the bore is tangential to the plates 5, 6, and also lies in a plane which is angled at an angle 6e with respect to a transverse plane parallel to the plane of each plate 5, 6. The angle ee is related to the angle of inclination 6r of the ramp 11 of each recess. If the angle of inclination of the axis 37 of the bore is Ge, at nominal chordal centres e , and the ramp angle is Or at radius r , then it follows thatEMI6.1 The mounting plate 35 provides a mounting for a mechanical brake applying mechanism 40 for applying the brake manually for parking or in an emergency. As illustrated the mounting plate 35 has a pair of axially spaced arms 41 which project from one end of the plate 35 and between the outer ends of which extends a pivot pin 42. A bifurcated lever 43 is pivotally mounted at its outer end on the pin 42 and at its opposite inner end has a connection 44 adapted to be coupled to a pull rod or similar inextensible brakeapplying member. A trunnion 45 is located at an intermediate point in the length of the lever 43, and the trunnion includes a block 46 which form a pivotal mounting for a wedge assembly 47.The wedge assembly 47 comprises a wedge 47 disposed between the balls 10 of an adjacent actuator pair, and a pullrod 48 which carries the wedge 47 and extends through a radial opening 52 in the flange 17 and an opening in the block 46. The pull rod 48 carries, in screwthreaded engagement at its outer end, an adjusting nut 50 which is in abutment with the block 46, and a lock nut 51. The radial opening 52 is spaced circumferentially from the opening 20, and is sealed by a sealing boot 53. When the brake is applied hydraulically by the master cylinder, the pistons 26 and 27 move in opposite directions to urge the two lugs 28 and 29 relatively away from each other to initiate application of the brake. Due to the angle of inclination of the axis 37 of the cylinder 24, the input forces of the pistons 26 and 27 act in directions to move the pressure plates 5, 6 both angularly and axially. When the brake is applied manually, a brakeapplying force applied to the lever 43 moves the lever 43 angularly about the pivot pin 42 as an axis, to withdraw the wedge 47 in a radial direction and separate the balls 10 of the said actuator pair. Due to the engagement of the balls 10 in the recesses 3, the pressure plates 5 and 6 are caused to move angularly in opposite directions and initiate application of the brake, as described above. The effective length of the pull rod 48 can be adjusted to compensate for wear of the friction linings by adjusting the positions of the nuts 50, 51. In the brake of Figures 4 and 5 the mechanical brake applying mechanism 40 projects into the brake through the radial opening 20. In this construction the brake applying mechanism 40 comprises a bell crank lever 60 which is pivotally connected to the plate 5 by means of a pivot pin 61. The lever 60 has a partcircular nose 62 which co operates with the lug 29 on the plate 6 which is extended axially across the plate 5. The lever 60 is adapted to be moved angularly about the pivot by means of a pull rod 61 which, in turn, is coupled at its outer end to a lever 62.The lever 62 is pivotably mounted at one end on a pivotal connection 63 on the mounting plate 35 so that a brakeapplying force applied to the opposite end is operative to withdraw the pull rod 61 from the housing 4, at the same time moving the bell crank lever 60 angularly, in turn to urge the two plates 5 and 6 angularly, relatively away from each other. The bell crank lever 60 is parallel to the axis 37 so that it is also angled at an angle of 6e, and therefore applies input loads to the plates 5 and 6 in a similar direction and manner to that of the hydraulic actuator 22. The pivot pin 61 has a stem of conical profile which is received in a circular opening in the bellcrank lever 60 in order to align the lever 60, and the pin 61 is screwed into a tapped hole in the plate 6 which is normal to the plane of that plate, to facilitate manufacture. The construction and operation of the brake ofFigures 4 and 5 is otherwise the same as that ofFigures 1 to 3 and corresponding reference numerals have been applied to corresponding parts. In the embodiments described above there may be a tendency for the component of the brake applying force which acts in the direction to cause axial separation of the pressure plates 5 and 6 also to cause the plates 5, 6 to separate by a greater distance in the region of the actuator 22 than at a point diametrically opposite the actuator 22. During such an effect the forces acting on the balls 10 adjacent to the actuator 22 are reduced and the ball or balls 10 diametrically opposite the actuator 22 act as pivot points during the application of the brake, thus lifting the pressure plates 5, 6 relatively towards the actuator 22. In consequence the further the moment arm is away from the zero point of the angle, the greater will be the lift. To compensate for this effect the tolerances between the pilot lugs 7 and 8 and the pressure plates 5 and 6 are chosen to bring the offset of the faces on the pressure plates 5 and 6, which co operate with the lugs 7 and 8, to a zero value in an assembled condition. An additional machining operation may be necessary to achieve the necessary tolerances at the pilot faces. In the modified construction illustrated inFigure 6 of the accompanying drawings the arrangement of the lugs 28, 29 is reversed with the lugs being spaced circumferentially from each other in a relatively opposite direction and with the lugs 28, 29 projecting in a generally axial direction over the peripheral edge of the other plate. Abutment faces 70, 71 on the lugs 28, 29 and with which the pistons 27 and 26 respectively co operate are generally normal to the axis 37 of the bore of the cylinder 24. When the brake is applied, the axial component of the brake applying force is applied by the pistons 261 27 to the lugs 28, 29 in a direction so that at least the balls 10 adjacent to the actuator 22 are loaded onto the recesses 3. This ensures that those balls 10 closely follow the respective ramps 11. The pivot point is transferred from the balls 10 diametrically opposite the actuator 22 to the balls 10 adjacent to the actuator 22. Even if an angle appears between the actuator 22 and relative to any pivot point on the balls 10, any tendency for the plates 5 and 6 to lift will be relatively small, and substantially onethird in comparison with the embodiment of Figures 1 to 4, and Figures 5 and 6, and the relative lift between the two plates 5 and 6 is substantially eliminated. Existing tolerances between the pilot lugs 7 and 8 and the pressure plates 5 and 6 can be maintained, and no additional machining operation will therefore be required to bring the offset of the pilot faces of the two pressure plates 5 and 6 to a zero value. The construction and operation of the brake ofFigure 6 is otherwise the same as the brakes of Figures 1 to 3 and Figures 4 and 5, and corresponding reference numerals have been applied to corresponding parts. In the modified construction illustrated inFigure 7 of the accompanying drawings, the axis 37 of the bore of the cylinder 24 is parallel to the plane of the plates, and the abutment faces 70, 71 on the respective lugs 28 and 29 are parallel to each other and are inclined at the angle Ge to a normal to the axis 37. Thus, as in the modification of Figure 6, when the brake is applied at least the balls 10 adjacent to the actuator 22 are loaded onto the recesses 3, and the same effect is achieved as with the arrangement ofFigure 6.
