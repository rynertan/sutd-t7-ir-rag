# A control unit for establishing a four wire link via a pair of telephone lines.

## Abstract
A control unit for establishing a four wire connection between two terminals via a pair of telephone lines 21, 22, comprises switching means 24 which are operable to provide a connection to a pair of telephone lines 21, 22, signalling means 10 connectible to said lines via said switching means 24 to enable another control unit to be signalled via a line, and line send and receive circuitry 28, 29 connected to the switching means. The line send and receive circuitry 28, 29 has an input for connection to the send channel of a terminal and an output for connection to the receive channel of the terminal. A central control 82 controls operation of the switching means 24 and line send and receive circuitry 28, 29 to automatically establish a four wire connection and adjust parameters of the line send and receive circuitry to compensate for loss on the telephone line.
