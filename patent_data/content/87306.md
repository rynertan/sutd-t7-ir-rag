## Description
1 ACEAGING BOXES OR CARTONS The present invention relates to the packaging of eggs, fruit and other articles and, more particularly, to packaging boxes or cartons of the type comprising a moulded base part formed with article receiving pockets, and a cover part or lid which is fastened over the open top of the base part to close the latter. The base part may be moulded from fibre pulp or plastics material. For example, it is conveniently thermo formed from sheet plastics material.The lid may be formed from a blank of sheet material, such as, paperboard or cardboard. In known egg boxes of the above type, the base part, which is of rectangular shape in plan, is of greater height than the eggs to be disposed in its article receiving pockets. It is moulded from transparent plastics sheet material and is closed by a separate flat rectangular cardboard lidqhich is disposed generally flush with the rim of the base part. Such a combination is a particularly attractive construction for packaging eggs and other similar food items in that it provides for ready forming of the intricate base part and visual inspection of its contents, whilst lending itself to printing the lid with advertising matter and other information required by suppliers.However, known egg boxes have suffered from problems with regard to closing and fastening the separate lids and to providing sufficient structural integrity, particularly, at the edges of the lid, so as to permit boxes to be stacked one on top of another for the purpose of transport, storage and display, without damage to their contents. In one form of egg box of the above type, as described in British patent specification No.2072628A, the cardboard lid is clipped to upstanding posts of the base part in order to hold it in its closed position. The lid has tags of barb like s hape which are stamped from the lid material and these are depressed through holes in the tops of the posts.Such devices are difficult to be fastened. Moreover, the edges of the lid only rest on a narrow lip formed about the rim of the base part so that, whilst the lid is adequately supported centrally by the posts, its edges are not and have a tendency to bend downwardly within the base part, thereby risking damage to the contents of the box, particularly, under the weight of a stack of boxes. British patent specification No. 1008481 describes an egg box having a moulded base part and a flat lid in which the lid overlaps opposite longitudinal edges of the base part and has flaps depending from the longitudinal edges of the lid and extending downwardly against the outsides of the base part.These flaps may be printed with advertising or other information, so that such information is visible from the side when the boxes are stored or displayed in a stack, and are fastened to the sides of the base part, for example, by adhesive, in order to retain the lid in its closed position. Whilst this construction provides satisfactory support for the lid so that the boxes can be stacked without risk of damage to their contents, the lid may be difficult to open and, once open, may not be readily refastened. Other prior art which is of background interest in relation to this invention is British patent specifications Nos. 234752 and 947431, U.S. patent specifications Nos. 3193177, 3493164 and 3767109, and Trench patent specification No. 2188564. It is an object of the present invention to alleviate the problems experienced with hitherto linown packaging of the type described and to provide such a packaging box or carton in which the lid, when closed, is firmly supported on the base part. another object is to provide a packaging box or carton of the type described in which the lid may be readily fastened in its closed position and is easy to open and, if required, refasten. The invention consists in a packaging box or carton for eggs, fruit or other articles, in which a moulded base part formed with article receiving pockets is closed by a lid which is fastened over the opened top of the base part and projects above the base part, and in which the lid comprises a flat top portion having wall portions depending from at least two opposite edges thereof and projecting downwardly within the top of the base part, juxtaposed upstanding peripheral walls of the latter, and at least one of said wall portions has its bottom edge resting on support means projecting inwardly from the juxtaposed peripheral wall of the base part below the rim thereof, whereby to support the adjacent edge of the lid. The base part and lid may be of conventional rectangular shape in plan and the base part may com prise mutually parallel rows of article receiving pockets. The lid may be in the form of a hollow lid in which the flat top portion has wall portions depending from both its pair of opposite side and end edges. All four of these wall portions may project downwardly within the top of the base part and at least one of the pairs of wall portions may have their bottom edges resting on support means within the base part. In one arrangement, both pairs of wall portions have their bottom edges resting on such support means. Alternatively, one of the pairs may have bottom edge portions resting on the rim of the base part so as to achieve the necessary support of the lid top. Whilst in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the lid is completely separable from the base part for the purposes of opening the packaging, in an alternative arrangement, one of a pair of opposite wall portions projecting downwardly within the top of the base part may be fixed to the juxtaposed peripheral wall of the base part, for example, by adhesive, so that the lid is connected to the base part and can be hinged or folded about the fixed wall portion to open or close the package. Where a hollow rectangular lid is utilised the four wall portions depending from the edges of the flat lid top may simply be in tle form of flaps or, alternatively, some or all of the wall portions may be secured together at adjacent corners, for example, with adhesive. The lid may be fastened in its closed position by fastening means including a detent, such as, a lug or a tab, projecting inwardly from a peripheral wall of the base part and engaging in an opening or slot in an adjacent flap or wall portion of the lid.Where the lid is separable from the base part, detents are conveniently formed on at least one pair of opposite peripheral walls of the base part for cooperating with openings or slots in adjacent wall portions of the lid. In an alternative fastening arrangement, notches are formed in opposite ends of at least one of the wall portions of the lid and engage with detents formed at the adjacent corners of the base part. Conveniently, the support means for the wall portion s of the lid comprises ledges formed at the upper ends of the post like protuberances formed in the peripheral walls of the base part between the article receiving pockets adjoining the peripheral walls0 The lid top may be centrally supported by posts upstanding from the base part between the rows of article receiving pockets and projecting above the rim of the base part. In one embodiment, the base part is of lesser height or depth than the articles intended to be disposed in the article receiving pockets, and the lid projects above the base part so as to accommodate the upper ends of the articles. For example, the base part of an egg box according to the invention may be approximately three quarters of the height of the eggs to be packaged therein, and the hollow lid is constructed so as to accommodate the top quarter of the eggs. Posts between the rows of article receiving pockets may terminate level with the rim of the base part or, alternatively, project thereabove to support the central part of the lid top. In another embodiment in which the base part is of greater height or depth than the articles to be disposed in the pockets, the flat top portion of the lid may be disposed generally flush with the rim of the base part, when the lid is fastened in its closed position on the base part. With this invention, the central part of the lid top may be unsupported and any posts between the rows of article receiving pockets may be lower than the height of the base part, or even be entirely omitted, thereby facilitating removal of articles from the base part. In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of an egg box constructed in accordance with the invention and showing the base part and lid separated, Figure 2 is a plan view of the box shown inFigure 1, Figure 3 is a section along the line III III of Figure 2 showing the lid in its closed position, Figure 4 is a perspective view similar to Figure 1 of a second embodiment of egg box according to the invention, Figure 5 is a fragmentary sectional view along the line V V of Figure 4 illustrating the lid in its closed position, Figure 6 is a perspective view similar toFigure 1 of a third embodiment, and Figure 7 is a fragmentary sectional vie along the line VII VII of Figure 6 illustrating the lid in its closed position. In the drawings, like reference numerals are used throughout the views of the different embodiments to indicate similar parts. Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 3 of the drawings, the egg box comprises a moulded plastics base part 1 and a separate hollow cardboard lid 2, both of which are of generally rectangular shape in plan. The base part 1 may be a one piece moulding of plastics sheet material. For example, conveniently, it is fluidpressure formed or vacuum formed from high impact polystyrene sheet material. In the preferred form of the invention used for packaging eggs, the package comprises three such base parts 1 formed as an integral unit and joined end to end at mutually adjacent end edges by small spaced plastic webs 3 which provide a line of wealcness along which the paclcage can be readily split into its three component base parts each containing six eggs.The component base parts are identical and therefore only one base part is illustrated in full and will be described in detail. The base part 1 has six egg receiving pockets 1 disposed in its bottom in two mutually parallel rows extending longitudinally of the base part and has side and end walls 5,6 surrounding the rows of pockets. The height or depth of the base part is somewhat less than that of the eggs E to be packaged in the base part and the lid 2 projects above the base part to accommodate the upper ends of the eggs. The egg receiving pockets 4 are defined by the walls 5,6 of the base part and an array of interconnecting hollow partitions 10 extending between and joined to the base part walls. Hollow upstanding posts 7 project upwardly from the partitions between the two rows of pockets and at the centre of each set of four adjacent pockets, and hollow postlike protrusions 8,9 are moulded in the side and end walls of the base part between the pockets and extend upwardly from the adjoining partitions. The walls of the posts, post like protrusions, partitions and side and end walls of the base part are so shaped that each pocket 4 is generally part egg shaped.Moulded on the outside of each pocket are hollow upwardly extending ribs 11 which serve to stiffen the pocket and act as cushions to protect an egg against side blows or shocks. The closed bottom of each pocket is formed with an internal hollow boss 12, which serves as a protective cushion for the bottom of an egg and to stiffen the closed bottom of the pocket.. The central posts 7 project above the rim 13 of the base part and terminate in flat upper ends 14 for supporting the top of the lid. The post like protrusions 8,9 moulded in the side and end walls of the base part have flat upper ends 15 spaced a short distance below the rim and these serve as support ledges for the lid, as will be hereinafter more fully described. Projecting inwardly from the opposite end walls 6 of the base part, flush with the rim 13 of the latter, are two fastening detents for the lid which are in the form of hollow lugs or tabs 16. The ledges 15 of the protrusions 9 moulded in the end walls of the base part, immediately below the fastening tabs 16 provide stacking shoulders 17 on the outsides of the end walls of the base part for cooperating with the fastening tabs of an identical base part in which the first mentioned base part may be nested. For the purposes of storage, transportation and feeding into automatic egg packaging machinery, bases 1 are stacked in nested relation.When so stacked the stacking shoulders 17 of an upper base part rest on the lugs 16 of the base part within which it is nested in order to prevent the parts from wedging or jamming together and facilitate destacking of the bases by mechanical separating devices. The rectangular lid 2 comprises a flat top portion 18 and side and end wall portions or flaps 19,20 depending from the edges of the top. These walls are integral with the top 18 and are folded downw.ardly about creases formed in the cardboard lid material. Optionally, mutually adjacent walls 19,20 may be secured together at the corners. The lid may be stacked, and printed with any required advertising material or other information, in its flat condition and prior to folding down of the side and end wall flaps into their depending positions. The end walls 20 of the lid are stamped with slots 21 in positions to cooperate with the fastening tabs 16 on the base part. When the lid 2 is fitted onto the base part 1 to close the latter, the wall flaps 19,20 fit within the base part juxtaposed its side and end walls 5,6 and are retained in their folded positions by the latter. The lower edges of the walls 19,20 rest on the flat support ledges 15 provided by the post like protrusions 8, 9 on the side walls of the base part.These serve to support the edges of the lid whilst the lid top 18 rests on the tops of the two upstanding posts 7 Figure 3 . Hence, the lid is firmly supported and a series of such boxes may be stacked one on top of another without risk of damage to the contents. As the lid 2 is fitted into position, the end walls 6, 20 of the lid and base part are flexed so that the fastening tabs 16 engage in the adjacent slots 21 to fasten the lid in its closed position. When the box is to be opened, it is a simple matter for a person to flex the walls and disengage the fastening tabs from the cooperating slots. The lid may then be readily refastened by the reverse procedure. The embodiment illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 is similar to the first embodiment and comprises a moulded plastics base part 1 having a depth somewhat less than the height of the eggs E to be packaged in the base part, and a separate hollow cardboard lid 2 which projects above the base part to accommodate the upper ends of the eggs. However, in this second embodiment, the central posts 7 have been omitted from the base part to facilitate removal of eggs and fastening detents 23 are disposed at the corners of the base part and project inwardly from the rim 13. Below the rim, the base part is moulded at each corner with outwardly projecting stacking shoulders 24 for cooperating with the fastening detents 23 of an identical base part in which the firstmentioned base part may be nested.When so nested, the stacking shoulders 24 of an supper base part rest on the detents 23 of the lower base part in order to prevent the parts from wedging or jamming together. The rectangular lid 2 of the embodiment shown in Figures 4 and 5 comprises a flat top portion 18 and side and end wall portions or flaps 19,20 depending from the edges of the top 18. The wall portions 19,20 are integral with the top and are folded dowmfardly about creases formed in the card board lid material. Notches or slots 25 are stamped in the end edges of the side walls 19 in positions to cooperate vith the fastening detents 23 of the base part. These notches are formed at the bottom of outwardly inclined end edges 26 of the side walls.The end walls 20 of the lid also have end edges 27 inclined slightly outwardly so that, in the folded position of the lid, opposite ends of the walls 20 project slightly outwardly of the generally vertical side walls 19. Small rebates 28 are stamped in the bottom edges of the end walls 20, at opposite ends and adjoining the inclined edges 27. When the lid 2 is fitted onto the base part 1 to close the latter, the side walls 19 fit within the base part juxtaposed the side walls 5 and are retained in their folded positions by the latter.The lower edges of these side walls rest on the flat support ledges 15 provided by the post like protrusions 8 along the side walls of the base part. These serve to support the side edges of the lid. The notches 25 flex or snap into engagement with the corner detents 23 to fasten the lid in its closed position.To facilitate such engagement, below the notches 25, the end edges of the side wall 19 are inwardly inclined, at 29, to provide a form of lead in taper.When the lid is fitted onto the base part, the end walls 20 of the lid may require to be separately and positively urged into a position in which they engage within the base part juxtaposed its end walls 6.In this engaged position, the end walls 20 are inclined outwardly and bear against the inclined end edges 26 of the side walls 19 so as to restrain longitudinal movement of the lid and disengagement of fastening detents. Also in this position, the bottom edge portions 30 formed by the horizontal edges of the rebates 28 project over and rest on the rim 13 of the base part, at its corners, in order to provide support for the ends of the lid. The result is a lid which is firmly supported and a series of such boxes may be stacked one on top of another without risk of damage to the contents.When the box is to be opened, it is a simple matter for a person to flex the walls of the lid and base part so as to disengage the fastening detents 23 and the lid may be readily fastened by the reverse procedure, with manual inward pressure being applied, if necessary, to the end walls 20 of the lid to engage them within the end walls of the base part. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, the base part 1 is of greater height than the eggs to be disposed in the egg receiving pockets 4 and, in its closed position on the base part, the flat top portion 18 of the lid 2 is arranged to be generally flush with the rim 13 of the base part. Save for this difference in height or depth and the fact that the post like protrusions 9 in the end walls 6 of the base part terminate substantially flush with the rim, the base part is of similar configuration to that of the second embodiment. However, the lid 2 of this embodiment merely comprises a pair of side wall portions or flaps 19 depending from the longitudinal side edges of the flat top 18 of the lid.Notches or slots 25 are stanped in the end edges of the flaps 19, adjoining the flat top of the lid and below these notches, the end edges 29 are inclined inwardly to provide lead in tapers. At its opposite ends, the flat top of the lid is extended to provide end portions 30 which project over the adjacent end portions of the rim 13 of the base part, when the lid is fastened in its closed position. When the lid is fitted onto the base part to close the latter, the flaps 19 fit withinte base part 1 juxtaposed the side walls 5 and are retained in their folded positions by the latter. The lower edges of the flaps rest on the flat support ledges 15 provided at the tops of the protrusions 8 moulded along the side walls of the base part. These serve to support the lid at its sides whilst the projecting end portions 30 rest on the rim of the base part to support the ends of the lid. As with the preceding embodiments, the lid is firmly supported and a series of such boxes may be stacked one on top of another without risk of damage to the contents. As the lid is fitted into position, the flaps 19 flex to enable the notches to engage with the corner detents 23 of the base part to fasten the lid in its closed position. When the box is to be opened, the lid may be readily flexed to disengage these fastening notches and detents and it is also a simple matter to reengage them should it be desired to refasten the lid to the base part. Whilst particular embodiments have been described, it will be understood that modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims. For example, the embodiments hereinbefore described may be constructed to contain different quantities of eggs. Hence, both the number of pockets 4 and their arrangement can be altered. For example, a base part 1 may be constructed to have ten pockets divided into two parallel rows of five pockets each or, alternatively, twelve pockets arranged in three rows of four pockets each. In larger boxes of the construction illustrated in Figures 1 to 3, two or more fastening tabs 16 and cooperating slots 21 may be utilised at each end of the box for fastening the lid in its closed position.Moreover, the embodiments shown in Figures 4 to 7, particularly when constructed in larger sizes, may, similarly to the first embodiment, be moulded with posts 7 upstanding from the base part between the eggreceiving pockets for supporting the central area or part of the flat lid top 18. In the embodiments shown in Figures 1 to 5, the depending wall portions 19,20 of the hollow lids 2 may be secured together at the corners of the lids, for example, with adhesive. In a modification, one of the wall portions or flaps 19,20 of a lid 2 may be fixed, for example, by adhesive, to the juxtaposed side or end wall 5,6 of the base part so that the lid is permanently connected to the base part. It is opened or closed b flexing it about the fixed flap 19,20 or by hinging it about the crease between the fixed flap and the lid top 18 or another suitable crease formed in the fixed flaps parallel to the plane of the lid top.
