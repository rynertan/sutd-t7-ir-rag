# Device to reduce local heat flux through a heat exchanger tube.

## Abstract
Apparatus for reducing the heat flux in a localized area of a heat exchange tube, by placing a sleeve 50 inside of the tube 14 , creating a gap, or dead space, which fills with stagnant water, between the sleeve 50 and inner tube wall. This reduced heat transfer will considerably reduce or pre vent steaming on the outer side of the tube, thereby minimizing or preventing any solids from separating out at this location.
