# AN INDUCTIVE DISPLACEMENT TRANSDUCER SYSTEM

## Abstract
The primary winding 60 of a displacement transducer 40 is energised by turning on a transistor Q2 when a flip flop 166 has been reset to turn off a transistor Q3 , in response to a pulse A from a pulse generator 150 . The transistor Q2 does not turn on until the pulse has terminated and thereby turned off another transistor Q1 . The current builds up until a comparator 164 sets the flip flop 166 to turn on Q3 and thereby turn off Q2. In order to prevent overdriving a controlled device, the smoothed output Vo1, Vo2 from each secondary winding 82, 84 is applied to a corresponding comparator 168, 170 , either of which, when a predetermined threshold is overstepped, turns on Q1, to turn off Q2 , via a comparator 156 and prevents the flip flop 166 being reset via a com parator 158 .
