# Method of forming laminated single polarization fiber.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for manufacturing a preform from which is drawn an optical fiber, the core of which comprises layers of different glass composition. Layers of glass soot 20, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 are deposited on the flat, longitudinally ex tending sides 12, 14 of a thin, elongate mandrel 10 . Adja cent soot coatings have different refractive indices. A prelimi nary coating of cladding glass soot 36 is deposited on the laminated soot structure. The resultant composite body is con solidated and stretched to form a rod or core structure 40 upon which the final coating of cladding soot 44 is deposited. The resultant composite body is consolidated and drawn into an optical fiber. In a modification of this method, the mandrel 10 is removed after the planar soot coatings and preliminary coating of cladding soot are deposited thereon. The resultant soot body is consolidated and processed as drescribed previ ously.
