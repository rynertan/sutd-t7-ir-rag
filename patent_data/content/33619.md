## Description
BUILDING UNIT, BUILDING STRUCTURE OR FORM STRUCTURE FOR CONCRETE FORMED THEREFROM, AND METHODGOF MAKING SUCH STRUCTURES AND CONCRETE SHELLS The present invention relates to modular building units capable of being easily Joined to or arranged with other parts or units to provide a building structure. It is an object of this invention to provide building units which are simple and lightweight in construction, and to reduce both material and construction labour costs. It is another obJect of this invention to provide building units which, while simple and lightweight in construction, are of a design which provides sufficient strength to withstand damage from the elements or in normal use. It is a further obJect of this invention to provide a building unit which is well insulated and which comprise a built in ventilation system. It is yet another obJect of this invention to provide a building unit which, in combination with a plurality of similar units can be used to erect a building structure. With these objects in mind, the present invention provides a building unit comprising a substantially flat or planar inner facing wall, two opposed side walls extending substantially at right angles to said flat inner wall and a convex outer wall opposed to said flat inner wall, said walls defining a cavity space therebetween, said building unit being provided with integral means adjacent the side walls for attachment of said building unit to adjacent building units on either side. Preferably, the building unit has one or more internal rib members extending between the opposed side walls but spaced from said inner flat inner wall and said convex outer wall. More preferably, the internal rib member is scalloped or provided with a concave edge opposed to the inner and or the outer wall to allow for better air circulation around the rib members. Venting of the building unit may be provided by flapclosable openings in the inner flat wall and or the outer convex wall at the lower and or upper end of the building unit. If openings are provided in both the inner and outer walls then it is preferred that flap control means be provided such that only one of the openings is open at any one time. The integral means for attachment of the building unit to adjacent building units are preferably provided at the junction of the side walls with the convex outer wall.Preferably, said means comprise simple means which hook or clip together. In one embodiment the said means comprise a tubular member with a parallel sided opening extending throughout the entire length of the tubular member designed to provide a keyway for a complimentary tubular member on the next adjacent building unit, which complimentary tubular member may be of slightly smaller diameter than the other said tubular member or, alternatively, be sufficiently flexible to fit within said other tubular member. Thus each building unit is provided with two such tubular members on opposite junctions of the convex outer wall with the side walls the smaller tubular member on any one building unit being adapted to coact with the larger tubular member on the next adjacent building unit when any two units are placed in close juxtaposition and effectively clip together.The longitudinal parallel sided opening of the larger tubular member is flexed open to permit entry of the smaller tubular member. Each building unit may be constructed simply as a straight wall module to be used in conjunction with other similar modules to make a complete wall structure or they may be moulded in a variety of other forms for special purposes. In one embodiment the building unit is moulded with an integral cavity roof section, wherein a plurality of such sections placed side by side provides a wall and one half of a gabled roof. In conjunction with an equal number of opposing building units there is provided two opposed parallel walls and a complete gabled roof overhead. In the case of larger building structures, partitioned into smaller internal areas, the gable construction method can be extended to provide a plurality of adjacent gables.In this case the wall portion of the building unit can be integral through a Y junction with two half gable roof portions, the wall portion acting as a partition wall between an area covered by two gabled roof portions. The building units may be manufactured from a variety of lightweight materials, including aluminium and fibreglass.In one preferred form the building units are moulded or constructed from U.V. stablized fibreglass, the size and weight of each unit being such that it may be manipulated into the required position on the building site by one or two men. This provides for portability and ease of construction of buildings which will comply with local government regulations. The internal ribs and the convex outer wall provide for a high strength unit which will withstand heavy hail. The building unit may be fixed to the floor or to the ground of a building site by any suitable means In one embodiment, the lower end of the wall unit can be placed outwards to allow for the building unit to be securely set in concrete or to be simply placed in a trench which can be back filled. The invention will be further described with reference to the attached drawings which illustrate some preferred features or embodiments of the invention. In the drawings Fig. 1 illustrates a building structure constructed from modular building units in accordance with the present invention Fig. 2 illustrates a partly sectioned perspective view of a modular building unit according the present invention Fig. 3 is a cross sectioned elevational view taken through a series of adjacent modular building units and Fig. 4 illustrates use of the modular unit structure as a concrete formwork to form an outer concrete building shell structure. As illustrated in Fig. 1, building structures may be prepared according to the teachings of the present invention by joining together a plurality of modular building units 1 in the embodiment as illustrated, each modular building unit is formed with a vertical cavity wall section 2 and an integral cavity roof section 3, at an oblique angle to the cavity wall section, braced as at 9 by a section of the inner wall joining the wall and roof sections. According to this embodiment, a plurality of such units placed side by side provides a wall and one half of a gabled roof. In conjunction with an equal number of opposed building units there is provided two opposed parallel walls and a complete gabled roof overhead to bridge the space therebetween, as illustrated in Fig. 1.End walls may be provided not illustrated by means of a plurality of adjacent simple straight walled modular building units, or by other suitable means, in accordance with conventional building construction practices. Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, each modular building unit comprises, in preferred form, a hailstone resistant convex outer wall 4 and a substantially flat or planar inner wall 5, which together with the sidewalls 6 define a cavity space 7 fig. 3 therebetween. Preferably, the building unit is provided with a tensile compression spacer or internal rib member 8 extending between the opposed sidewalls 6, but spaced from the outer wall 4 and the inner wall 5. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3 the rib member 8 is provided with a concave edge opposed to the inner wall 5, to provide for better air flow through the building unit, in conjunction with internal and external flap controlled vents 14 17, inclusive. In forms of the modular building unit without internal rib members, there may be provided an inner inflatable bladder which, under pressure, provides extra strength to the whole unit, or to a number of adjoining units, enabling the building structure to span greater distances. Each modular unit may be provided with integral means to facilitate easy attachment of any one unit to its adjacent unit or units. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3 such integral means include complementary interlocking ridges or flanges 10, semi annular in cross section, which are designed to positively interlock together when adjacent units are brought together into close juxtaposition. Along the top ridge of the gabled building structure shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the opposed and abuting modular units are joined and connected by means of complementary retaining flanges 11. The joint between adjacent inner walls of the building units, joined together as herein described, may be covered by a suitable joining strip, which may be integral with the unit or secured by an convenient means, such as glueing or screwing. The cavity space 7 in the building unit serves not only as an insulating means and as a venting passage, but may also serve as a convenient service duct for electricity, gas, water and communications systems in the finished building structure. As shown in Fig. 3, there is provided space for service tubes 12 to extend up the opposed sidewalls 6 of the building unit and through each rib member 8. Referring to Fig. 4, the modular building units of the present invention provide a simple and fast means of assembling a form structure on which to cast an outer concrete skin 13, reinforced by steel rods 18 and steel mesh 19. When the concrete skin has set sufficiently, the modular form structure can be removed and the surface of the concrete structure can be treated to provide the desired finish. If the convex surface 4 of the modular unit is provided with a textured surface, then a corresponding texture finish can be imparted to the concrete structure. As shown in Fig. 4 the convex outer face 4 of the modular unit is accentuated to give extra strength. Further, the retaining flanges 10 are provided as integral with the inner surface 5 of the unit, and are adapted to interlock with adjacent flanges, as previously described, or alternatively, to provide means for locking adjacent units together with the aid of removable tie rods not illustrated . By this means it is possible to very rapidly produce the form work for quite large concrete building structures within a period of only several days. One of the many potential applications of the present invention is in the manufacture of modular greenhouse structures, and especially such structures which under ideal conditions are self sufficient in terms of the energy input required for heating and or cooling. By controlled use of the vents 14 17 and with the help of suitable auxilliary means, it is possible to maintin a desired mean temperature, say 20 250C, with controlled humidity, inside the greenhouse structure. For example, by controlled use of the vents 14 17 it is possible to obtain efficient air circulation by the venturi effect which is created. Hot air drawn through vent 16 can be directed down to vent 14 and passed through a suitable heat exchange or heat absorbing medium, e.g. water mist, a water moistened evaporative screen, or metal aggregate.The cooled air can be recirculated and the absorbed heat can be utilised for internal heating where required. A draught of air entering one of the bottom vents 16 or 17 and drawn up to one of the top vents 14 or 15, may be sufficient to operate a vane type generator, to produce electricity for use in the greenhouse. The service tubes 12, Fig. 3 in a greenhouse structure, may take the form of water pipes for the productions of solar heated water. Water could be circulated by the thermosyphon effect with hot water being stored in a storage tank underground, beneath the greenhouse, to provide heating of the soil. The greenhouse structure can be further insulated from temperature change by a number of means, including filling the cavity space 7 during the night with polystyrene beads and removing same by suction the following morning, and the provision of venetian or slat type shades or screens inside the structure, which may either be controlled manually or automatically by photo or temperature sensor means. Although the invention has been described above with reference to preferred embodiments and drawings, it will be appreciated that numerous variations, modifications or alternatives may be substituted for specifically described features, without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described.
