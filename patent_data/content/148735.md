# EQUIPMENT FOR CLOSING CONDUITS

## Abstract
The present invention briefly refers to equipment for closing conduits and comprises a closing lid 1 having two cir cular disks with a peripheral sealing ring of resilient material. A tightening device connects the two disks at the center thereof causing during tightening to compress the sealing ring radially outwardly. The tightening device is of very stable construction conferring to the disks a parallel movement without mutual ro tation. The equipment moreover comprises a mounting device 30 having three parts which are mobile in relation to each other, an attachment yoke 31 , a main clamp 39 and a sup port plate 43 . With the aid of a cog gear 40 and racks 42, 44 rotary movements are transformed into either a clamping movement between the closing lid 1 and the support plate 43 or a pulling movement between the closing lid 1 and the main clamp 39 .
