# Aluminum production cell components.

## Abstract
An electrolytic aluminum production cell component, comprising a preformed matrix based on at least one material from the group alumina, aluminum oxynitride, SiAION, boron nitride, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, aluminum boride and carbides, carbonitrides, boronitrides and borcarbides of me tals from Group IVb titanium, zirconium and hafnium Group Vb vanadium, niobium and tantalum and Group VIb chro mium, molzbdenum and tungsten having voids extending throughout its structure, the voids in the preformed matrix structure being filled or substantially filled with aluminum in in timate contact with the matrix.
