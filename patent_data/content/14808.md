## Description
DESCHIPTION This invention relates to coating compositions. More particularly, the invention relates to polymeric, high solids coasting1 compositions adapted to provide an automotive topcoats. Because of increasingly strict solvent emissions regulations in recent years, low solvent emission paints have become very desirable.A number of high solids paint compositions have been proposed to meet these low solvent emission requirements however, many of these compositions are deficient because of difficulty of application, slow curing rates, lack of flexibility, poor durability and low solvent and water resistance. Many of the proposed compositions have been particularly deficient as automotive topcoats. The present invention provides a coating composition which comprises A a hydroxy bearing oligoester i having a number average molecular weight Mn Of between about 150 and about 3000, ii bearing at least about 2 hydroxyl groups per molecutle, .and. iii being formed by an esterification reaction between a carboxylic acid and an epoxide and a polyisocyanate crosslinking agent having an average of at.least two reactive isocyanate groups per molecule, and being included in said coating composition in an amount sufficient to provide between about .5 and about 1,6 reactive iso anate groups per hydroxyl group present in said composition. In addition, the coating composition of the invention may include additives, catalysts, antioxidants, U.V. absorbers, flow control or wetting agents, antistatic agents, pigments, plasticizers, solvents, etc. Preferably the thermosetting coating compositions of this invention preferably contain greater than about 50 by weight, and most preferably greater than 70 by weight of nonvolatile solids. The preferred compositions of the invention are particularly suitable for those applications requiring high gloss, hardness, durability, and high solvent and water resistance as well as a fast cure rate at relatively low temperatures, e.g., between about 200C. and about 1300C., preferably between about 750cm and about 100 C, Each of the components of the high solids ting compositions of the invention, the amounts of each of the components required to achieve the desired results of the invention and methods for applying the composition are described hereinafter in greaterdetail. hydroxy Functional Oligoester One of the two principal components in the high solids coating compositions of this invention is a hydroxy functional oligoester i having a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 150 and about 3,000, preferably between about 230 and about 1000, ii bearing at least about 2 hydroxyl groups per molecule, and iii being formed by an esterification reaction between a carboxylic acid and an epoxide. Exemplary of the hydroxy functional oligoesters useful in compositions of the invention are i the esterification reaction product of a polycarboxylic acid, i.e.a carboxylic acid bearing 2 or more carboxyl groups, and a monoepoxide ii the esterification reaction product of a polyepxoide, i.e., a compound having 2 or more epoxide groups and a monocarboxylic acid and iii the esterification reaction product of a hydroxy functional carboxylic acid and a mono or polyepoxide. The first type of hydroxy functional oligoester noted abode is rcfzrably prepared Li by eacLiny aQproxi mately 1 to 1 equivalent quantities of a polycarboxylic acid with an alkylene oxide in the presence of an esterification catalyst. A small excess of the alkylene oxide is desirable, but not necessary. Among the preferred carboxylic acids for preparing this type of oligoester are aliphatic and aromatic acids including succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dodecane dicarboxylic acid, dimer fatty acid, trimer fatty acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, and hexahydrophthalic acid.Still other useful acids are various carboxy bearing polymers including carboxy terminated polyesters, carboxy terminated polybutadienes, and the like. Such materials will be apparent to those skilled in the art Although numerous acids may be employed to make this type of oligoester, dicarboxylic acids containing 6 to 12 carbons are most preferred. Of course, mixtures of the various di or polycarboxylic acids may also be employed. Monoepoxides useful in preparing this first type of oliqoester are epoxides which contain a three membered epoxide group. Preferred epoxides are alkylene oxides of two to three carbon atoms, such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Among the many other useful epoxides which will be apparent to those skilled in the art are 1,2 butylene oxide, 2,3 butylene oxide, 1,2 hexylene oxide, 1,3 epoxy decane, 1,2 epoxydodecane, cyclopentene oxide1 styrene oxide, butyl glycidyl ether, epichlorohydrin. etc Of course, mixtures of monoepoxides may also be used. The second type of hydroxy functional oligoester noted above may be prepared by reacting one or more polyepoxides with one or more monocarboxylic acids, preferably in an approximate equivalent ratio. useful polyepoxides contain at least two epoxy groups with the diepoxides being most preferred. Amonq the preferred diepoxides useful in the preparation of such an oligoester are diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A and butyl diglycidyl ether. Monocarboxylic acids useful may be selected from aliphatic. cycloaliphatic, and aromatic carbxylic acids and ki,d ma .es thereof Exemplary of the many acids which may be employed are benzoic acid, t butyl benzoic acid and acetic acid.Preparation of oligoesters from monocarboxylic acids and polyepoxides is well known in the art and is further described, for example, in U.S. patents 2,456,408 and 2,653,141. The preparation of the hydroxy functional oligoester by the esterification reaction of a hydroxy functional monocarboxylic acid with an epoxide is described in U.S.patent 3,404,018, the teachig s of which are hereby incorporated by reference. While the epoxides employes in accordance with the teachigns of that patent are polyepoxides, oligoesters may be prepared in a similar manner to that described therein by employing a monoepoxide, such as an alkylene oxide, and a hydroxy functional monocarboxylic acid as described therein. Numerous monoepoxide materials suitable for this purpose will be apparent to those skilled in the art. It will be appreciated that various combinations of carboxylic acids and epoxides other than those specifically discussed above may be reacted in order to provide oligoesters useful in the high solids compositions of the invention. For example, oligoesters bearing hydroxy functionality other than that produced by the esterification reaction may be produced by reactinq not lust a hydroxy bearing carboxylic acid with an epoxide as discussed above, but by reacting carboxylic acids and epoxides. either of which bears hydroxyl functionality.Examples of such oligoesters are i trihydroxy oligoesters prepared by reacting a monocarboxylic acid with a monohydroxy diepoxide such as hydroxy glycidyl ethers of bisphenol A and aliphatic hydroxy glycidyl resins, ii trihydroxyXoligoesters prepared by reacting a monohydroxy monocarboxylic acid such as 3 hydroxy butyric acid 4 hydroxycyclohexyl carboxylic acid or 4methylol benzoic acid with a monohydroxy monoepoxide such as glycidol and l,4 butanediolmonoglycidyl ether or iii trihydroxy oligoesters preparedbv reacting a monocarboxylic acid with a hydroxy monoepoxide such as acetic acid with 2 , 3 epoxy ,4 butana diol. It will be appreciated by those skilled inthe art that all of the above are merely exemplary of the various oligoesters falling within the scope of those useful in compositions of the invention. Noninterfering functionality present in the car boxylic acid or epoxide molecule employed in preparing any of the above hydroxy functional. oligoesters may yield certain specific coating properties which may be desirable.Such functionalities andztheir effects which will bye apparent to those skilled in the art may include, for example, ahalogen. an ester linkage, a reactive double bond, etc.More specifically. for example, anfoligoester prepared by reaction of chlorendic acid and propylene oxide when fnrmulated with a polyisocyanate in accoreance with the invention yields a polyurethane coating which exhibits fire retardant properties. Preferred esterification catalysts useful in preparation of hydroxy functlonal oligoesters by the esteri fication reactions discussed above are the tetralkyl ammonium salts such as tetra methyl ammonium chloride, tetraethyl ammonium bromide and trlmethyl benzyl ammonium chloride as well as metal salts of a carboxylic acid. such as potassium octoate or chromium III octoate. Other useful esterification catalysts include metal halides such as chromium trichloride, ferric trichloride, and aluminum trichloride mercaptans and thioethers such as octyl mercaptan, dimercapto propanol and dimercapto diethyl ether tertiary amines such as triethyl amine, pyridine. dimethylandine, quinoline, B picoline, ethylpyridine and the like. Still other catalysts known to catalyze carboxy epoxy reactions will be apparent to those skilled in this art. In all cases, the oligoesters formed are low molecular weight adducts having a narrow molecular weight distribution when compared to similar compositions made by normal polyester manufacturinq techniques. Various mixtures of these types of oliqoesters may also be employed within the scope of the compositions of the invention described herein.Polyisocyanate Crosslinking Agent The other major component of the thermosetting, high solids coating composition of the invention is a polyisocyanate, i.e., a compound having 2 or more, preferably 3 or more, reactive isocyanate groups per molecule. This polyisocyanate crosslinking agent is included in the compositions of the invention in an amount sufficient to provide between about .5 and about 1.6 preferably between about .8 and about 1.3 reactive isocyanate groups per hydroxy group in the composition. Most preferably the crosslinking agent is included in an amount sufficient to provide about 1.1 isocyanate groups per hydroxyl group in the composition. Polyisocyanates are well known in the art and numerous suitable isocyanates having 2 or more reactive isocyanate groups per molecule will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Among the many suitable polyisocyanates are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic isocyanate compounds. Representative of the numerous isocyanates which may be employed are 1 aliphatic diisocyanates such as trimethylene diisocyanate. tetramethylene diisocyanate, pentamethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate.1,2 propylene diisocyanate, 1,2 butylene diisocyanate, 2,3 butylene diisocyanate, 1,3 butylene diisocyanate, ethylidene diisocyanate. butylidene diisocyanate, 4,4 bis isocyanate hexyl methane, bis 2 isocyanate ethyl fumarate, 2,6diisocyanate methyl caproate, 2,2,4 2,4,4 trimethylhexa methylene diisocyanate, and dimer acid diisocyanates 2 cycloaliphatic diisocyanates such as 1,3 cyclopentane diisocyanate, 1,4 cyclopentane diisocyanate, 1,3 cyclopen tane diisocyanate, and methylcyclohexylene diisocyanate 3 aromatic diisocyanates such as m phenylene diisocyanate, p phenylene diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenyl diisocyanate, 1,5 methylene diisocyanate, 1,4 napthaiene diisocyanate 4 aliphatic aromatic diisocyanates such as 4,4 diphenylene methane diisocyanates, 2,4 or 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate, 4,4 toluidene diisocyanate, 1,4 xylylene diisocyanate 5 nuclear substituted aromatic compounds such as dianisidine diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylether diisocyanate, chloro diphenylene diisocyanate 6 triisocyanates such as tri phenylmethane 4,4 , 4,4 triisocyanate, 1,3,5 triisocyanate benzene, 2,4,6 triisocyanate tolaene 7 tetraisocyanates such as 4,4 1diphenyl dimethylmethane 2,2 , 5,5 tetraisocyanate, 8 polymerized isocyanates such as tolylene diisocyanate dimers and trimers and the like, and 9 polyisocyanates such as prepolymers derived from a polyol, including polyether polyols or polyester polyols including polyethers which are reacted with excess polyisocyanates to form isocyanate terminated prepolymers , simple polyols such as glycols e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene glycol , other polyols suchas glycerol, trimethylol propane, hexane triol, pentaerythritol and the like, as well as monoethers, e.g. diethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol and the like and polyethers, i.e., alkylene oxide condensates of the above. Especially preferred to use in the compositions of the invention are trimerized products of aliphatic diisocyanates such as 1,6 hexamethylene diisncyanate. Still another particularly preferred type of crosslinking agent is a polyisocyanate having a biuret structure. This type of polyisocyanate is well known as are methods for makinq the same. One such polyisocyanate crosslinking agent is a high molecular weight biuret of 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate sold by Mobay Chemical Company under the tradename DesmodurN. Exemplary of other biuret type polyisocyanates are those prepared in accordance with U.S. Patent 3, 976,622 to Wagner et al. Other Materials In addition to the above discussed components, other materials may be included in the high solids coating compositions of the invention. These include conventional materials such as catalysts, antioxidants, U.V. absorbers, solvents, surface modifiers and wetting agents, as well as piqments. The solvents used in the coating compositions of the inventions are those which are commonly used and which will not react with the compositifln components. Typical solvents useful in the coating compositons facilitate spray application at high solids content and include toluene, xylene, methylethyl ketone, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, ethylacetate, dimethylsuccinate, dimethylglutarate dimethyladipate, or mixtures thereof.As mentioned above, the nonvolatile solids content of the high solids coating composition is at least 50 and preferably 70 or more, thus limiting the amount of solvent included in the composition. Surface modifiers or wetting agents are common additives for liquid paint compositions. The exact mode of operation of these surface modifiers is not known, but it is thought that their presence contributes to better adhesion of the coating composition of the surface being coated and helps formation of thin coatinqs on surfaces, particularly metal surfaces. These surface modifiers are exemplified by acrylic polymers containinq 0.l lO percent weight of coPolymerized monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid esters such as methacrvlic acid esters, acrylic acid esters or itaconic acid esters, cellulose acetate butyrate, silicon oils or mixtures thereof. Of course, the choice of surface modifiers or wetting agent is dependent upon the type of surface to be coated and selection of the same is clearly within the skill of the artisan. A particularly useful additive for the high solids coating compositions is a flow control additive which is prepared as described in Example D of U.S. Patent 4,075.141 to Samuel Porter, Jr. et al dated February 21, 198. That flow control additive, which is actually a nonagueous dispersion, is preferablv employed in amounts ranging from about 5 to about 10 weight percent based on total resin solids,althouqh greater or lesser amounts may be used. The high solids coating composition of the invention also may include pigments. The amount of pigment in the composition may vary, but preferably is between about 3 and about 45 weight percent based on total solids weight of the composition.Application Techniques ihe high solids coating compositions of the in vention can be applied by conventinnal methods known to those in the art. These include roller coating, spray coating, dipping or brushing and, of course, the particular application technique chosen will depend on the particular substrate to be coated, the environment in which the coating operation is to take place, and the pot life o.f the compo sition. A particularly preferred technique for applying the high solids coatinq compositions, particularly when applying the same to automobiles as topcoats, is spray coating throuqh the nozzle of a spray gun.In accordance with this preferred technique, the hydroxy functional oligoester and the hydroxy functional copolymer along with other additives such as piaments, U.V. absorbers, antioxidants and other nonreactive materials are admixed with a solvent. These materials are fed as one component of a two component system into a spray gun which combines the materials as they are sprayed onto the automotive substrate The other material is the isocyanate crosslinking agent, which may ormay not be cut with a suitable nonreactive solvent. The invention will be further understood by referring to the following detailed examples. It should be understood that the specific examples are presented by way of illustratinn and not by way of limitation.
