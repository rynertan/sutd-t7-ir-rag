# Transmission, in particular for a motor vehicle.

## Abstract
A transmission unit for a motor vehicle comprises an infinitely variable V belt transmission 1, 13, 2 and a reversing gearing 18 connecting the input shaft 14 to the primary pulley 3, 4 of the V belt transmission 1, 13, 2 . The reversing gearing 18 is operated by means of a forward and a reverse signal in order to transmit rotation in an equal or opposite direction. A pitot tube 41 is positioned within a channel 42 , carried by the primary pulley 3, 4 , to produce a hydraulic signal function of the speed of rotation. Control means 36 actuated by the hydraulic signal are provided in order to prevent the engagement of the reverse gear.
