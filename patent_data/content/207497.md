## Description
The present invention relates to a novel quinolonecarboxylic acid derivative of the following formula I , The compound represented by the formula I , contains optical isomers, owing to an asymmetric carbon on the aminopyrrolidine ring, the 7 substituent. But all of optical isomers and their mixture are represented, for convenience, by the unitary formula. Hence, the scope of the invention is not limited to one of the optical isomers or their mixture. Quinolonecarboxylic acid antibacterial agent began with nalidixic acid and have been developed to piromidic acid, furthermore, to pipemidic acid. They are useful agents for the medical treatment against urinary tract infections with aerobic gram negative bacteria. Norfloxacin, which has been developed by us recently, exhibits potent antibacterial activity not only against gram negative bacteria but also against gram positive bacteria. Moreover, its potency is extremely stronger than the previous quinolonecarboxylic acids. Norfloxacin became an epoch making progress in this field, it has been used clinically very often at the present time. The later quinolonecarboxylic acids, such as, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, which have substituents similar to norfloxacin, have been continuously developed. Ciprofloxacin possesses stronger antibacterial activity than that of norfloxacin. But the antibacterial potency against gram positive bacteria is fairly inferior to that against gram negative bacteria. On the other hand, the increase of β lactam antibiotics resistant gram positive bacteria such as In addition, it has been evidenced that obligate anaerobes on skin or mucous membrane act as the pathogen of opportunistic infection owing to the popularization of anaerobes inspection as a result of the development of clinical testing technology. It has been reported that anaerobes are found with or without an aerobic bacteria at the rate of 50 80 on respiratory tract infections, intraperitoneal infections, chronic otitis media, paranasal sinusitis and obstetrical and gynecological infections, and the rate of the combination of anaerobes with On these background, the development of new antimicrobial agents with stronger activity and broader spectrum is required. It was found that, in animals, the compound of the invention showed good oral absorption, excellent tissue distribution, satisfying biological stability and acceptability. In following, explanation is made about the preparation process for the compound of the invention. Namely, by allowing compounds represented by the formula II to react with amines represented by the formula III , compound of the invention represented by the formula I is synthesized. The reaction of compounds represented by the formula II with compounds represented by the formula III preferably is carried out by heating the mixture in a solvent such as water, alcohols, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide DMF , dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO , hexamethylphosphoric triamide, pyridine, picoline and the like or in the absence of the solvent. The reaction temperature is selected appropriately in a range of room temperature to 200 C, preferably room temperature to 160 C. In more details, it is preferable to allow compounds represented by the formula II to react with 1 to 5 times mole of compounds represented by the formula III for 1 to several hours at room temperature to 120 C in 2 to 10 times volume of aforementioned solvents. At this time, the use of deacidifying agents such as triethylamine, diazabicyclo bases and potassium carbonate is also desirable. Moreover, compounds I wherein R¹ or R² is a lower acyl group, a lower alkoxycarbonyl group, a benzyl group which may be substituted, a trityl group, can be converted to amino group according the usual method to offer the compound of the invention, for example, hydrolysis with acid or alkali, catalytic reduction and so on. Moreover, compounds I wherein R is a lower alkyl group can be hydrolyzed according to the usual method and ester is converted to carboxylic acid to offer the compound of the invention. Such hydrolysis can be carried out easily with alkalies such as potassium hydoxide or acids such as sulfuric acid at room temperature to boiling point of solvents in water, mixed liquor of water with alcohols, mixed liquor of water with acetic acid, and so on. Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I can be converted, if desired, to the pharmaceutically acceptable ammonium salts or carboxylic acid metal salts by treatment with acid or alkali. The acid may be organic or inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid and lactic acid. The carboxylic acid metal salts may be, for example, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, aluminum, cerium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, zinc, platinum and silver salts. The compound of the formula I , hydrates and salts thereof may be used as medicines in the conventional form of pharmaceutical preparations, which may be, for example, tablets, capsules, powder, ointments, suppositories, injections or eye drops, suitable for peroral, parental, enteral or local administration. The following examples will further illustrate the present invention without, however, limiting it thereto. A mixture of 8 bromo 1 cyclopropyl 6,7 difluoro 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid 200 mg , anhydrous acetonitrile 3 ml , 1,8 diazabicyclo 5,4,0 7 undecene 95 mg and 3 t butoxycarbonylaminopyrrolidine 280 mg was refluxed for an hour under stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred for further 4 hours at room temperature and then concentrated. To the resulting residue was added the cooled mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid methanol 4 ml 1 1 , stirred for 45 minutes in an ice bath. The reaction mixture was neutralized with concentrated aqueous ammonia, the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water and recrystallized from chloroformmethanol to give the title compound 80 mg as pale yellow prisms, mp 207 210 C decompd. . Analysis for C₁₇H₁₇BrFN₃O₃ 2 H₂O, Calcd. Found C, 45.75 45.88 H, 4.74 4.25 N, 9.42 9.42 . Minimal inhibitory concentrations MICs were determined in accordance with the method recommended by Japan Soc iety of Chemotherapy. The results are shown in Table 1.
