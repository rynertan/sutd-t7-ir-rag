# Method and apparatus for manufacturing ammonia synthesis gas from a stream of gas rich in hydrogen and a stream of nitrogen.

## Abstract
Difficulties associated with the operational stability of a conventional cryogenic plant for manufacturing am monia synthesis gas from a stream rich in hydrogen and a stream of nitrogen are reduced by using three heat ex changers in place of the conventional single heat exchan ger. In use, the first heat exchanger 102 , which is pre ferably arranged with its cold end uppermost, is used to cool the stream of nitrogen. Part of the nitrogen leaving the first heat exchanger 102 is passed downwardly through a third heat exchan ger 204 where it is further cooled before being introduc ed into a nitrogen wash column 104 where it acts as reflux. The third heat exchanger 204 is cooled by vapour leaving the top of the nitrogen wash column 104 . After being cooled in the first heat exchanger 102 the stream rich in hydrogen is passed upwardly in a second heat ex changer 202 where it is further cooled before being in troduced into the lower portion of the nitrogen was co lumn 104 . A modification is also described which facilitates re covery of most of the small amount of hydrogen in the liquid leaving the bottom of the nitrogen was column 104 .
