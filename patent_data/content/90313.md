# Vibration suppression system for diesel engine.

## Abstract
A vibration suppression system for a diesel engine, comprises a device 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 for decreasing the amount of intake air to be inducted into the engine when operated. A heating device 17 is provided to heat the intake air when operated. A first detecting device 27, 30 is provided to detect a low engine speed and low engine load operating range of the engine, to produce a first signal in response thereto. A second detecting device 32 is provided to detect the level of vibrational acceleration of engine vibration having frequencies within a predetermined range, and to produce a second signal in response thereto. First and second control devices 31, 33, 34, 35, 36 are provided respectively operate the intake air amount de creasing device in response to the first signal and the heat ing device in response to the second signal, thereby throt tling intake air in the low engine speed and low engine load operating range while heating intake air when the vibration acceleration level is outside a predetermined allowable range.
