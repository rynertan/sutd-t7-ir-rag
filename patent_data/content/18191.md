# Universal input output system construction for programmable controllers.

## Abstract
By providing an input output housing which incorpo rates paired slider assemblies 28, 29 for supportingly maintaining a printed circuit board in secure electronic en gagement between a central processor and external devic es, with said printed circuit board being quickly and easily removable from the electronically engaged position, an in put output system 21 for a programmable controller is achieved which is capable of being quickly and easily ex panded as well as capable of rapid field assembly and field disassembly for removal or replacement of any required parts. In addition, the external equipment wiring is made to a termal block 30 which is mounted between the paired slider assemblies 28, 29 and pivotally engaged therein to provide readily accessible concact points for initial inter connecting thereto, while also being pivotally movable and slidingly advanceable into the housing for continuous maintenance therein in a secure, hidden, easily accessible storage zone. In the preferred embodiment, all connectors in the input output system 21 are solderless connections to assure rapid assembly and disassembly capabilities.
