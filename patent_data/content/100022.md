# Pharmaceutical composition containing adenosine derivatives for use in treating tumours.

## Abstract
A pharmaceutical composition by which the growth of tumor cells, e.g., human tumor cells, in a host is arrested and killed, while normal cells thereof are substantially unaf fected, is disclosed. The composition contains as active substance adenosine 5 diphosphate ADP or adenosine 5 triphosphate ATP . ADP and ATP are capable of permeating through the plasma membrane of a variety of tumor cells, e.g., human tumor cells, and are incorporated into the cel lular acid soluble nucleotide pools of these cells, without prior breakdown to adenosine 5 monophosphate AMP or adenosine, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and cel lular growth followed by cell death, while normal animal cells do not allow penetration of ADP or ATP through their plasma membrane without prior degradation.
