# Method for stabilization of UV sensitive plastics.

## Abstract
Method for extending the useful life of polymers which are sensitive to photodegradation by ultraviolet light. In this method, the resistance of UV sensitive polymers is enhanced by the incorporation therein of an ultraviolet light stabilizer effective amount of at least one compound of the formula
