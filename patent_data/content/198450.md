# Vehicle control system for controlling side slip angle and yaw rate gain.

## Abstract
A control system for a controlled vehicle having front 9, 10 and rear wheels 11, 12 has a steering wheel angle sen sor 2, 104 , a vehicle speed sensor 3, 100 , a controller such as a microcomputer 1 , and an actuating system for varying actual steering gear ratio and actual rear wheel steer angle to approach to desired values under command of the controller. From input quantities, the controller deter mines a desired steering gear ratio by using equations of motion so that a desired steady state side slip angle
