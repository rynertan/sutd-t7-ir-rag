## Abstract
A power supply for charging a storage battery includes a switching pulse width modulator for controlling the current flowing from an input rectifier to an output transformer. The input rectifier is convertable from a full wave bridge to a voltage doubler for operation at two different line voltages. A current limiting circuit and a charging voltage control circuit are both responsive to sensed output current to closely match the output of the power supply to the charging capacity of the battery. An overcurrent sensing circuit protects the power supply and battery against the results of line transients and shorted battery cells. A sensing circuit detects the absence of a battery, and an end of charge sensing circuit detects full charge voltage. A latching circuit disables the power supply on detection of overcurrent, absence of a battery, or full charge voltage.

A full wave rectifier, preferably an encapsulated full wave bridge assembly, composed of diodes 160, 162, 164 and 166 is connected between junctions 152 and 158, with the anode of diode 162 and cathode of diode 160 connected to junction 152, and the anode of diode 164 and cathode of diode 166 connected to junction 158. The cathodes of diodes 162 and 164 are connected to a junction 168, while the anodes of diodes 160 and 166 are connected to a junction 170. As illustrated, a positive voltage appears at junction 168, and a negative voltage appears at junction 170. 3unction 168 is connected through line 172 to input 174 of a conventional integrated circuit positive 15 volt voltage regulator 176, and 170 is connected through line 178 to input 180 of a conventional integrated circuit negative 15 volt voltage regulator 182. The reference terminals 184 and 186 of regulators 176 and 182 are shown as connected to ground 116. Output 188 of regulator 176 is connected to 15 volt line 190, and output 192 of regulator 182 is connected to negative 15 volt line 194.

To accomplish this, jumpers 138 and 142 would be removed, and a jumper, not shown, added between terminals 104 and 106. Another jumper, not shown, would be added between terminal 102 and terminal 110. Terminal 112 would be connected to ground 116, changing point 234 from a virtual ground to an actual ground. These changes serve to connect the rectifier composed of diodes 206, 208, 210, 212 as a full wave bridge rectifier, rather than a voltage doubling rectifier, so that the same voltage appears between lines 224 and 228.

As will be apparent, if voltage appearing between terminals 596 and 598 is excessive, current will flow through diode 646 and 654, and develop a voltage at junction 658. Junction 658 is connected to a gate terminal 662 of a switch means shown as SCR 664. A capacitor 666 is interposed between gate terminal 662 and ground 116 for transient suppressing purposes. To give a visible indication of an overcurrent situation, which may be caused by a shorted battery, shorted connecting leads, line voltage transients, and the like, an indicating means shown as a light emitting diode is provided. A resistor 668 is interposed between 22 volt line 204 and a junction 670 joined to line 672. A light emitting diode 674 has its anode terminal 676 connected to line 672 at junction 678, and its cathode terminal 680 connected to anode terminal 682 of SCR 664 at junction 684.Light emitting diode 674 may bypass a resistor 686 connected between junction 678 and 684 to provide adequate current flow through SCR 664 to maintain it conductive once it has been triggered, if necessary. Cathode terminal 688 of SCR 664 is connected, at junction 690, to a resistor 692 connected to ground 116 and to a line 694 connected to input 488 of pulse width modulator 460. Thus, excessive current detected by current sensing means 278 will cause SCR 664 to be triggered, illuminating light emitting diode 674 and energizing line S94 to stop pulse width modulator 460 and de energize the output of battery charger 20. A second light emitting diode 700 has its anode terminal 702 connected to junction 670, and its cathode terminal 704 connected to anode terminal 706 of a switch means shown as SCR 708. SCR 708 has its cathode terminal 710 connected to junction 690, and its gate terminal 712 connected to the parallel combination of capacitor 714 and resistor 716 connected between terminal 712 and ground 116. As illustrated. terminal 712 is joined to a line 718, and resistor 716 is joined to line 718 at junction 720. Thus, voltage appearing on line 718 will trigger SCR 708, illuminating light emitting diode 700, and applying a voltage to line 694 to stop pulse width modulator 460. As will become apparent, voltage will be applied to this line if a battery has ot an 80 percent charge level after 12 hours of charging. First and second switch means shown as SCR 664 and SCR 708 and their associated components are part of the latch means according to the invention, and light emitting diodes 674 and 700 serve as means for indicating that the pulse width modulator 460 has been stopped. Turning now to FIG. 7, it may be seen that storage battery 402, also shown in FIG. 5, is connected to a voltage divider and buffer operational amplifier which provides a voltage proportional to a predetermined fraction of the voltage of storage battery 402. In the preferred embodiment, this fraction is equal to the voltage of three cells of storage battery 402. As illustrated, battery 402 is connected across The voltage appearing on line 756 performs five functions, three of which are shown in FIG.9. Line 756 is connected to input 760 of a comparator 762, an input 764 of a comparator 766 and an input 768 of a comparator 770. As will become apparent, comparator 762 detects the absence of a storage battery or the presence of an unchargeable battery, comparator 766 detects the completion of charge, and comparator 770 provides a signal when storage battery. 402 is at least 80 percent fully charged. These conditions are detected by comparison with reference voltages provided by a voltage divider chain composed of resistors 772, 774, 776 and 778. Preferably, resistor 772 is a variable resistor having its first end 780 connected to 15 volt line 190, and its second end 782 connected to junction 784. Resistor 774 has its first end 786 connected to junction 784, and its second end 788 connected to junction 790.Resistor 776 has its first end 792 connected to junction 790, and its second end 794 connected to junction 796. Resistor 778 is connected between junction 796 and ground 116. Junction 784 is connected to input 798 of comparator 766, so that comparator 766 provides a signal on output line 800 when the voltage across storage battery 402 is equivalent to that of a fully charged storage battery. Junction 790 is connected to input 802 of comparator 77Q, so that a signal is provided on output line 804 when the voltage across storage battery 402 is equivalent to that of a storage battery having 80 percent charge. Junction 796 is connected to input 806 of comparator 762, so that a signal is provided on output line 808 when there is no storage battery connected to the preferred embodiment of the invention. A signal will LaYsavv be provided when there is very low cell voltage, approximately 1.85 volts or less per cell of storage battery 402, indicating that it is defective or sulfate to the extent that it cannot be conventionally charged. As will become apparent, the signals appearing on output lines 800, 804 and 808 operate to latchingly stop the operation of the preferred embodiment of the invention. Timer means according to the preferred embodiment of the invention are illustrated on FIGS. 9 and 10, and partially in FIG. 8. As will appear more fully below, timer means according to the preferred embodiment of the invention include a three hour timer, a six hour timer and a twelve hour timer. Normally, the charging of a new, good battery will never be determined by timer means according to the invention. As illustrated, when a storage battery 402 charges to 80 percent of its full charge level, a signal is provided on line 804, and charging continuous for three additional hours. A six hour timer is provided for use where it is desirable to overcharge storage battery 402 to neutralize possible stratification of acid or sulfation of plates, known as equalizing the battery. The twelve hour timer is provided to discontinue charging of a very old battery which never reaches the 80 percent charge level. In FIG. 8, output line 808 is connected to junction 810 through the series combination of a resistor 812 and diode 814. The cathode terminal 816 of diode 814 is shown connected to junction 810, to illustrate the direction of current flow.Diode 814 and two other diodes described below are unnecessary to the preferred embodiment of the invention, but are provided for isolation purposes, so that, for test purposes, it may be determined which of several signals is responsible for stopping pulse width modulator 460. Output line 800 is also connected to junction 810 through the series combination of a resistor 818 and diode 820, having its cathode terminal 822 connected to junction 810. A junction 824 is interposed between resistor 818 and diode 820. A diode 826 has its anode terminal 828 connected to junction 824, and its cathode terminal 830 connected to junction 832. A line 834 joins junction 832 and a junction 836. As will become apparent, line 834 carries a signal from a flip flop circuit composed of inverting buffers 838 and 840 responsive to push button switch 842, which is manually activated when it is desired to attempt to charge a battery for six hours past the 80 percent charge level. As illustrated, inverting buffer 838 has an input 844 joined to junction 846 and an output 848 joined to junction 850. Inverting buffer 840 has an input 852 joined to junction 850 and an output 854 joined to junction 856. Junction 856 is joined to junction 858 in a line 860 which serves in part to interconnect junctions 846 and 858. Junction 856 is connected through series resistor 862 to ground 116 through junction 864.A resistor 866 extends between junction 856 and a junction 868. A capacitor 870 is interposed between junction 864 and 868. A resistor 872 is interposed between junction 836 and junction 874, which is directly connected to junction 868.Switch 842 is interposed between junction 874 and junction 846. As can be seen, a low signal level initially exists at junction 846, and the six hour timer is disabled. A high signal level exists at junction 850, and a low signal level exists at junction 856. Junctions 844 and 856 being joined by line 860, this condition is stable. The high voltage appearing at junction 850 also appears at junction 874, so that when switch 842 is closed, a high voltage appears at junction 846, a low voltage appears at junction 850 and a high voltage appears at junction 856. Since junctions 846 and 856 are interconnected, this condition remains after switch 842 is again opened, applying a high voltage signal to line 860. If switch 842 is again closed, this situation will reverse, as the low voltage at junction 850 is applied to input 844. Subsequent operations of switch 842 will cause the voltage on line 860 to alternate between high and low voltage levels. As will be apparent, lines 834 and 860 carry signals which may override and disable the three hour timer of the timer means according to the preferred embodiment of the invention, and enable the six hour timer. When a high voltage exists at junction 856, output 876 of an inverting buffer 878 having its input 880 connected to junction 856 will have a low voltage level. Thus, current will flow from line 190 through the series combination of a resistor 882 and a light emitting diode 884 having its cathode terminal 886 connected to output 876, illuminating diode 884. Timer means according to the preferred embodiment of the invention includes a conventional, commercially available 24 stage frequency divider 890, preferably of the type that has outputs from only its last seven stages. A 60 Hz signal source 892 is provided, such as from junction 152 or 158, as shown in FIG. 6, and applied to a signal input 894 of divider 890. Suitable current limiting resistors, not shown, may be interposed between signal source 892 and input 894. This signal, carried by line 896, is rectified and bypassed to ground 116 by the parallel combination of a diode 898 and a capacitor 900. As will be apparent to one skilled in the art, a higher frequency signal may also be applied simultaneously to input 894 to change the times determined by timer means of the preferred embodiment of the invention without any further circuit changes, and that a full wave bridge may be used in place of diode 898 to double the frequency applied to input 894. As illustrated, divider 890 provides a signal on line 902 which first assumes a high voltage level 0.6 hours after a 60 Hz signal is first applied to input 894. Line 904 assumes a high voltage level after 1.2 hours, a line 906 assumes a high voltage level after 2.4 hours, a line 908 assumes a high voltage level after 4.8 hours, and a line 910 assumes a high voltage level after 9.6 hours.Divider 890 has a reset input 912 connected to line 804 through a capacitor 914 and bypassed to ground 116 by a resistor 916. Thus, when a signal appears on line 984 indicating that a storage battery such as battery 402 has charged to 80 percent of the full charge level of a new battery, the divider 890 will be reset by a reset pulse, and will begin timing anew. As will become further apparent below, the preferred embodiment of the invention provides a constant current level until the battery being charged has reached an 80 percent charge level, and then begins controlling the current applied. The signals from lines 902, 904, 906, 908 and 910 are processed into three, six and twelve hour signals by NAND gates 929, 922 and 924. NAND gate 920 has a first input 926 connected to line 804, a second input 928 connected to line 902, a third input 930 connected to line 906, and a fourth input 932 connected to junction 832 through line 934. Thus, a low voltage level signal will appear at output 936 of NAND gate 920 for stopping modulator 460 after divider 890 has been operating for the sum of 0.6 hours and 2.4 hours, the battery being charged has reached an 80 percent charge level, and a high voltage is provided at junction 836 in FIG. 9, indicating that switch 842 has not been operated. NAND gate 922 includes a first input 936 connected to line 804, a second input 938 connected to line 904, a third input 940 connected to line 908 and a fourth input 942 connected to line 860. Thus, a low voltage signal for stopping modulator 460 will be provided at output 944 of gate 922 when divider 890 has been operated for the sum of 1.2 hours and 4.8 hours, comparator 966 has detected an end of charge condition and switch 842 has been depressed. NAND gate 924 has a first input 946 connected to line 906 and a second input 948 connected to line 910.Thus, a low voltage signal will appear at output 950 of gate 924 when divider 890 has been operating for the sum of 2.4 and 9.6 hours. The signal appearing at output 950 is shown applied to inputs 952 and 954 of a NAND gate 956, serving as an inverter, causing a high voltage signal level to appear at its output 958. This signal is applied to line 718 through series resistor 960, causing switch means shown as SCR 708, shown in FIG. 8, to become conductive, illuminating light emitting diode 700 and applying a signal to line 694 to stop modulator 460. The signals appearing at outputs g36 and 944 of respective gates 920, 922 are applied to first and second inputs 962 and 964 of a NAND gate 966, serving as an OR gate. Presence of this signal at either input 962 or 964 will cause a high voltage level signal to appear at output.968 of gate 966, which is applied to junction 970 through the series combination of a resistor 972 and diode 974, having its cathode terminal 976 connected to junction 970. This diode may also be eliminated, if desired, since its primary function is isolation for test purposes. Junction 970 is joined to junction 810, shown in FIG. 9 by a line 978, and includes a junction 980 connected through line 982 to the input terminal 584 of a switch means shown as SCR 986, shown in FIG. 8. The anode terminal 988 of SCR 986 is connected to junction 678 through a line 990 and a light emitting diode 992 having its anode terminal 994 connected to line 990. SCR 986 has its cathode terminal 996 connected through a line 998 to junction 690. Thus, a signal applied to line 982 will cause SCR 986 to become conductive, illuminating light emitting diode 992, and applying a signal to line 694 to stop modulator 460. The signal appearing on line 982, electrically connected to junction 970, is bypassed to ground 116 through the parallel combination of a capacitor 1000 and a resistor 1002, and also connected to 5 volts supply 464 of modulator 460, shown inFIG. 4 through a diode 1004 having its cathode terminal 1006 connected to 5 volt supply 464. Turning now to FIGS. 3 and 4, an amplifier 1010 and its associated circuitry serves as charging voltage control means responsive to current sensing means 278 according to the invention. Line 614, carrying a current responsive signal, is connected to a first terminal 1012 of a potentiometer 1014, having its second terminal 1016 connected to ground 116. Movable contact 1018 of potentiometer 1014 is connected through a resistor 1020 to junction 1022. Junction 1022 is connected to inverting input 1024 of amplifier 1010. A potentiometer 1026 has a first terminal 1028 connected to line 1030, connecting it to 5 volt supply 464 at output 484 of pulse width modulator means 460, and a second terminal 1032 connected to ground 116. Its movable contact 1034 is directly connected to noninverting input 1036 of amplifier 1010. Amplifier 1010 has an output terminal 1038 connected to junction 1040. The parallel combination of a resistor 1012 and an integrating or bypass capacitor 1044 is connected between output terminal 1038 and inverting input terminal 1024 of amplifier 1010. A line 1046, connected to junction 1040, is connected to a first terminal 1048 of a resistor 1050 which has its second terminal 1054 connected through a line 1056 to input 481 of pulse width modulator means 460, for in part controlling its duty cycle. Potentiometer 1014, together with resistors 1020 and 1042, set the gain of amplifier 1010 responsive to the current sensed, and potentiometer 1026 is a charge voltage setting control. FIG. 3 shows various circuitry including current limiting means according to the invention, and dead band control circuitry for insuring that output transistors 468 and 470 of pulse width modulating means 460 are not conductive simultaneously. The active components of current limiting means according to the invention are amplifiers 1058 and 1060. As illustrated, line 614, carrying a current responsive signal, is connected to anode terminal 1062 of rectifying diode 1064, and its cathode terminal 1066 is connected to inverting input 1068 of amplifier 1058. The parallel combination of a resistor 1070 and capacitor 1072 is connected between inverting input 1068 and ground 116. Amplifier 1058 has an output terminal 1074 connected to junction 1076. A line 1078 interconnects junction 1076 and noninverting input 1080 of amplifier 1058. A line 1082 interconnects junction 1076 and a first terminal 1092 of a resistor 1094, having a second terminal 1096 connected to inverting input 1098 of amplifier 1060. Amplifier 1060 includes an output terminal 1100 connected to junction 1102. A parallel combination of a resistor 1104 and capacitor 1106 is connected between junction 1102 and inverting input 1098.Noninverting input 1108 of amplifier 1060 is connected to movable contact 1110 of potentiometer 1112. First terminal 1114 of potentiometer 1112 is connected to 15 volt line 194, and second terminal 1116 is connected to ground 116.Potentiometer 1112 serves to set a predetermined current limit. Junction 1102 is connected to a line 1118, through a junction 1120, to input 486 of pulse width modulator means 460, and serves to limit the current supplied to battery 402 by narrowing the pulses produced by pulse generator 466 of pulse width modulator 460. A series combination of a resistor 1122 and a rectifying diode 1124 is interposed in line 1118 between junction 1102 and 1120, with diode 1124 oriented so that its anode terminal 1126 is in nonrectifying electrical connection with junction 1120. Line 1056 is shown filtered by the parallel combination of capacitors 1128 and 1130, and a line 1132, joined to line 1134 through a resistor 1136 and connected to input 482 of pulse width modulator means 460 which is filtered by the parallel combination of capacitors 1138 and 1140.Capacitors 1128, 1130, 1138 and 1140 serve to filter the signals appearing on the respective lines to which they are attached to ground 116.The technique of using two paralleled capacitors for filtering is well known. A large value capacitor is capable of passing low frequency components, but has large inherent inductance, making it unsuitable for passing high frequency components. Thus, a paralleling low value capacitor is used to pass high frequency components of a signal such as a noise signal. A voltage divider composed of resistors 1142 and 1144 divides the three cell voltage appearing on line 756 by, in the illustrated preferred embodiment of the invention, a factor of three, and applies this divided voltage to line 1134, for relating the charging voltage applied to storage battery 402 with its state of charge. Resistor 1142 has its first terminal 1146 connected to junction 1148 in line 756, and its second terminal 1150 connected to junction 1152, which is connected to line 1134. Resistor 1144 has its first terminal 1154 connected tojunction 1152, and its second terminal 1156 connected to ground 116. The remaining components are dead band control circuitry, filtering circuitry, rectifying, limiting and threshold sensitive circuitry. A potentiometer 1158 serves to adjust the dead band so that output transistors 468, 470 of pulse width modulator means 460 are not simultaneously conductive. First terminal 1160 of potentiometer 1158 is connected to line 1030 bt junction 1162, and second terminal 1164 and movable contact 1166 are joined together at junction 1168, and thus connected to line 1170. A variable temperaturesensitive resistor 1172, preferably mounted on a transistor heat sink, is connected between ground 116 and a junction 1174 in line 960, to insure that the pulse width and resultant output power is reduced if the heat sink, and the transistors mounted to it, become too hot. A resistor 1176 and zener diode 1178 are interposed between line 756 and line 1170. Zener diode 1178 is oriented so that its anode terminal 1180 is in nonrectifying electrical connection with junction 1182 in line 1170. Diode 1178 is chosen so that a higher voltage level signal will be applied to line 1170 when battery 402 approaches full charge, to increase the duty cycle of pulse generator 466 of pulse rate modulator 460 to increase the output voltage to the battery, particularly at low line voltage. A resistor 1184 interconnects a junction 1186 in line 1170 and ground 116. The cathode terminal 1188 of a rectifying diode 1190 is connected to junction 1186, and its anode terminal 1192 is connected to a line 1194. A capacitor 1196 intercon nects line 1194 and ground 116. A clampiQd afiua 1198 has its anode terminal 1200 connected to line 1194, and its cathode terminal 1202 connected to line 1030. This assures that the voltage on line 1184 cannot exceed the voltage on line 1030. A diode 1204 is connected between line 1194 and line 1118, and has its anode terminal 1206 connected to junction 1120, and its cathode terminal 1208 connected to line 1194. A capacitor 1210 is connected between line 1030 and ground 116. Thus, as will be apparent, the voltage on line 1118 is driven to a more negative value to decrease the duty cycle of pulse generator 466 of pulse width modulator 460 to limit the current, current limiting also increasing the dead band.The components of dead band control and charging voltage control are linked in a loop, since amplifier 1010 and potentiometer 1158 both receive their input from voltage appearing on line 1030.A high voltage appearing on line 756, sufficient to pass through zener diode 1176, will be applied to line 1030 through potentiometer 1158, which thus limits the voltage applied to line 1030 to prevent overlap1 ,in the conductive times of transistors 468, 470 of pulse width modulator means 460. The characteristics resulting from the functions preformed,by the disclosed circuitry are illustrated in FIG. 9, interrelating percentage charge of battery 402 and voltage and ampere output of battery charger 20. The graph of FIG. 9 shows increasing voltage or amperage on axis 1210 from origin 1212, and increasing percentage of charge is shown with respect to axis 1214, perpendicular to axis 1210, from origin 1212. As illustrated by broken line curve 1216, the curre t a battery will accept may be quite high in the case of a fully discharged battery, and decreases initially in a generally linear manner as shown by portion 1218 of curve 1216, and then in an asymptotic manner to a final value as shown by portion 1220 of curve 1216. The output of battery charger 20 is shown as a solid line. The maximum output of battery charger 20 is limited by the size of the components, particularly those of transistors 254, 270, so that the output of battery charger 20 is a constant value as shown by horizontal portion 1222 of current output curve 1226, until the percentage charge of the battery being charged is such that the current which can be accepted by the battery equals the current which can be provided by battery charger 20. This point is indicated by reference numeral 1226, and is preferably the 80 percent charge level of the battery being charged.Thereafter, in portion 1228 of curve 1224, the current output of battery charger 20 tracks the current acceptance of the storage battery being charged. The output voltage curve 1230 includes a generally linearly increasing portion 1232 when the percentage charge of the battery is low, a sharply increasing portion 1234 when the percentage charge of the battery is at an intermediate value, and an asymptotic decreasing portion 1236 as the battery being charged approaches full charge. This characteristic of the disclosed circuitry is quite advantageous, since it matches the energy output of the battery charger 20 to the energy acceptance characteristic of the plates of a storage battery such as battery 402. As is known, when battery plates or electrodes are substantially fully discharged, they will accept very little energy without becoming too warm.However, when they are partly charged, their conductivity increases so that significantly higher energy may be applied and accepted. When they approach full charge, the energy input should again be decreased to prevent overheating, since the conversion efficiency of the battery again decreases. The instant invention, which controls voltage responsive to current, provides an energy output that is quite well matched to the energy conversion efficiency of a storage battery being charged. Numerous modifications and variations of the disclosed circuitry for accomplishing the objectives, teachings and advantages of the disclosed invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art, and be made without departing from the scope of the claimed invention.
