## Description
The present invention relates to a method of treating the waste solution which results from photographic processing, as well as an automatic photograph processor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method adapted to the treatment of the waste solution discharged from an automatic developer in which a silver halide photographic material is being worked, as well as the automatic photograph processor suitable for use with this method. Photographic processing of a silver halide photographic material generally contains steps of development, fixing, washing and so on if the material is a black and white light sensitive material, and involves steps of color development, bleaching, fixing, washing, stabilization, etc. if a color light sensitive material is to be processed. The working solutions employed in either case have the ability to perform one or more photographic functions. In processing a large amount of light sensitive material, it is customary to keep the make up and hence the performance of each working solution constant ont only by compensating for the components consumed in a specific step but also by eliminating any component in the working solution which increases in amount e.g., bromide ions in the developing solution and silver complex salts in the fixing bath . In order to compensate for the consumed component, a replenishing solution is added to a specific working solution, and for the purpose of eliminating the excess of the component which has increased in amount, part of the working solution is discarded. Primarily for environmental and economic reasons, concerted efforts are being made by modern photofinishers to drastically reduce the use of replenishers including the washing water which is a replenisher for the washing step. Even in this modern system, the waste working solution is dis charged from each of the tanks in the automatic developer and, after being guided through a drain pipe, the solution is diluted with the waste washing water for disposal in sewage or other appropriate places. With a view to coping with limited water resources and the increased cost of water feeding and drainage and in order to provide ease in the installation of the automatic processor and to improve the working environment around the machine, photographic processing with a water less automatic processor has been designed and is gaining commercial acceptance. This machine performs a stabilizing step as an alternative to washing and requires no water feed drain piping other than what is installed within the machine. It is generally under stood that in this sort of photographic processing, the use of cooling water for stabilizing the temperature of working solutions is also desirably reduced. The effluent from the water less automatic developer is comprised solely of the replenished waste working solutions and is much smaller in amount than when a washing step is included in the process. Because of this feature, the need for installing pipes for water feeding and drainage is eliminated and all of the following problems associated with the conventional types of automatic developer can be solved a machine with water pipes is difficult to replace after installation the machine reduces the amount of floor space available for free movement of the operator additional costs are incurred in attaching pipes to the machine after it is installed in the proper place and energy costs with feeding hot water are comparatively high. The water less automatic processor is free from these disadvantages and its small size and operational simplicity will allow its use as an office machine. However, processing with such water less automatic processor results in the discharge of fairly large quantities of waste solutions even in a comparatively small scale operation, the daily effluents are no less than 10 liters for the processing of X ray light sensitive materials, 30 liters for platemaking light sensitive materials, and 30 liters for color photographic materials. In the absence of external water pipes, the treatment of the effluents from the water less automatic developer is relatively complicated first of all, when a certain waste solution tank in the developer is filled with the waste solution, this event must be detected either with a sensor or by visual checking so as to allow for a timely replacement of the tank, and if this is not done, the waste solution will overflow the tank and foul the floor, thereby cancelling the advantages offered by the water less automatic processor i.e., the machine does not have to be equipped with external piping and can be installed on a clean floor or a carpeted floor . Aside from the high cost of the sensor, processing with the water less automatic processor involves one major problem associated with aesthetic appeal in that the container for accommodating the recovered waste solution is more likely to be fouled than when the waste solution is discharged into sewage through the drain pipe. Most of the photographic processing solutions used today contain easily oxidizable components and are liable to form tar or precipitates as a result of aerial contact during storage. If, as in the usual practice, two or more working waste solutions are recovered in the waste solution tank, the chance of oxidation or precipitation is further increased to form tar or precipitates which are deposited on the bottom or side wall of the tank and will solidify to foul or otherwise degrade the working environment. The tendency of tar formation is particularly great in waste solutions containing hydro quinones or phenidones black and white developing agents , or phenylenediamine derivatives color developing agents and splashes of such waste solution will soil the operator s clothes or cause rashes on his skin. A waste solution containing thiosulfate ions will be oxidized to form a sulfur precipitate. If these two types of waste solution are mixed, the degree of tar formation and precipitation is even more increased, and in the presence of a certain substance such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid iron III salt, troubles such as the precipitation of iron hydroxide or oxide that will cause considerable difficulty in handling may occur. The last, but by no means least, problem associated with the processing with the water less automatic processor is that it discharges an aqueous solution which cannot be immediately disposed of by incineration. A processing system in which no waste washing water occurs will yield waste solutions with high BOD and COD loads which cannot be directly discharged into sewage. The most advantageous way to dispose of such waste liquors is incineration. One object, therefore, of the present invention is to provide a novel method of treating photographic waste solutions that cannot be discarded in sewage or other appropriate places. Another object of the present invention is to provide a simple and safe method that is capable of recovering waste effluents from a water less automatic processor without using a level sensor or other sophisticated devices and without introducing the possibility of fouling the floor on which the processor is installed. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method of treating photographic waste solutions by disposing of or incinerating them as they are put in a flexible container or paper bag. A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of recovering photographic waste solutions from an automatic processor that permits extended storage of the waste solutions without causing oxidative tar formation or precipitation which will degrade the working environment. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a method of treating photographic waste solutions by using a resin that will absorb them to give a product that is easy to handle for the purpose of silver recovery. Another object of the present invention is to provide a compact and clean automatic photograph processor. The first four objects of the present invention can be accomplished by a method wherein at least part of the waste solution that results from the processing of a photographic material with working solutions is absorbed by a resin. The fifth object of the present invention can be accomplished by a method comprising a step wherein at least part of the waste solution that results from the processing of a photographic material with working solutions is absorbed by a resin, and a step wherein silver is recovered from the resin. The sixth object of the present invention can be accomplished by an automatic photograph processor that includes a means for transporting a photographic material and a means for automatically feeding working solutions and which is characterized by having a space wherein at least part of the photographic waste solution is absorbed by a resin. Any resin that is capable of absorbing photographic waste liquors may be employed in the present invention, and resins having high liquid absorbing performance are preferably used. Such resins are capable of absorbing at least 30 times their weight of liquids. Preferably, at least 50 times, more preferably at least 100 times, and most preferably at least 500 times, the weight of the resin of liquids should be absorbed. For attaining higher processing efficiencies, the liquid absorbing performance of the resin should be of the highest level possible. The liquid absorbing ability is expressed in terms of the weight of a resin sample after swelling upon 5 minute immersion in a photographic waste liquor at ordinary temperatures devided by the weight 1 g of an unswollen sample. The photographic waste solutions to be treated by the present invention mean one or more exhausted working solutions having specific gravities of no less than 1.01 such as a black and white developing solution, a color developing solution, a fixing bath, a bleach fixing bath, a bleaching bath, a stabilizing solution, a stop solution, an image stabilizing solution, a rinsing solution, and a washing replacing stabilizing solution. It should be noted that washing water having a specific gravity of less than 1.01 is excluded from the scope of these photographic waste solutions . The liquid absorbing performance depends not only on the liquid absorbing ability but also on the rate of liquid absorption, and the higher the absorption rate, the better. It is desirable that an appropriate resin of high liquid absorbing performance is selected in consideration of both the liquid absorbing ability and the absorption rate. The resin of high liquid absorbing performance desirably has the capability of retaining the photographic waste solution for an extended period it is also desirable that the resin will not release the absorbed liquid under slight pressure. An inflammable resin is particularly preferable in view of the advantage it offers in post treatments. Different photographic waste solutions have different pH ranges 3 13 for a color developing solution, 3 9 for a bleaching bath and or a fixing bath, and 2 10 for a washing replacing stabilization bath. It is therefore preferable that the resin of high liquid absorbing performance used will undergo minimum variations in its absorbing perform ance in the face of pH variations in each range. If desired, after the waste solution is absorbed by the resin, water and other volatiles may be evaporated and two or more absorption cycles repeated so as to concentrate the components in the waste solution. A resin of high liquid absorbing performance that absorbs a specific volume of waste solution and whose volume after swelling remains substantially smaller than said specific volume is advantageous in view of its compactness and, hence, it is this sort which is preferably used in the present invention. The resins that satisfy the requirements shown above and which may be used as resins of high liquid absorbing performance in the present invention include the following Seed root polysaccharides such as guar gum, locust bean gum, quince seed gum and tara gum seadweed polysaccharides such as carrageenan, alginic acid, furcellaran and agar resin polysaccharides such as gum arabino galactan, gum arabic, tragacanth gum and karaya gum fruit polysaccharides such as pectin tuber polysaccharides such as starch, Konjak mannan and Hibiscus root polysaccaride xanthan gum, zanflo, curdran, succino glucan,syzofiran, pullulan, gelatin, casein, albumin and shellac starch derivatives, guar gum derivatives, locust bean gum derivatives, and cellulosic derivatives such as oxidized, carboxymethylated, hydroxyethylated, hydroxypropylated, carboxymethylhydroxypropylated, and aminated celluloses alginic acid derivatives such as ammonium alginate and propylene glycol ester of aliginic acid vinyl polymers such as POVAL polyvinyl alcohol , polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyvinyl methacrylate acrylic polymers such as sodium polyacrylate and poly acrylamide and polyethylene oxide.

As mentioned earlier in this specification, photographic waste solutions containing developing agents paraphenylene diamine derivatives, in particular and or thiosulfate ions will form tar or precipitates if they remain untreated. These problems can be effectively solved by absorbing such waste solutions by resins of high liquid absorbing performance in accordance with the present invention. This will also solve the problem of the waste solution splashing which will foul the operator s cloths or cause rashes on his skin. In the practice of the present invention, each of the waste working solutions may be absorbed by a different resin, or two or more waste solutions may be absorbed by one resin and another group of waste solutions are treated by another resin. The following are preferred embodiments for implement ing the present invention. The waste solution from the step of color development is absorbed by one resin of high liquid absorbing performance while the waste solutions from the steps of bleach fixing and stabilization are combined and treated by a separate resin. The waste solutions from the steps of color development, bleaching and second stabilization are combined and absorbed by a resin of high liquid absorbing performance while the waste solutions from the steps of fixing and first stabilization are combined and treated by a separate resin. The waste solution from the step of color development and that from the step of second stabilization are absorbed by separate resins of high liquid absorbing performance. Overflows from the prefixing and first stabilizing tanks are directed into the bleach fixing tank and the waste solution therefrom is absorbed by a separate resin. The waste solutions from the steps of development and fixing are absorbed by separate resins of high liquid absorbing performance, while the waste washing water is discharged into sewage. These embodiments may be modified in an appropriate manner if one wants to apply the present invention to photo graphic processing schemes other than those specified above. The resin of high liquid absorbing performance that has absorbed a specific waste solution or a material of high liquid absorbing performance containing said resin is in a general case directly discarded or incinerated. If desired, they may be discarded or incinerated after performing a post treatment such as evaporation or dehydration. If the waste liquor contains silver ions, the resin is prefer ably subjected to silver recovery. Silver may be recovered from the ash of the residue left after incinerating the resin. Alternatively, the silver in the ash may be dissolved in nitric acid and the solution is electrolyzed to recover the silver. The present invention is particularly effective in solving the aforementioned problems associated with an automatic processor that is not equipped with any pipes for feeding washing water or for feeding and draining cooling water. The concept of the invention is also effective in photographic processing with an automatic processor of the type from which part of the waste solutions cannot be discharged into sewage or any other appropriate places, or even in processing without an automatic processor. The photographic materials that can be used in the practice of the present invention are not limited to silver halide photographic materials and may be any type of the photographic material that is processed by working solutions and which will yield waste solutions that can be absorbed by resins of high liquid absorbing performance. The following examples are provided for the purpose of further illustrating the present invention but are by no means intended as limiting. A sample of color paper was prepared by conventional methods. The silver halide was silver chlorobromide with 25 mol of AgCl , which was applied to a base of polyethylene coated paper to give a silver coating weight of 10 mg 100 cm², and the web was dried. The thus prepared sample was exposed in a color printer and processed by the following scheme in an automatic processor having the basic design shown in Fig. 2. In accordance with the scheme shown above, 1,000 color prints of the cabinet size 12 16.5 cm were continuously processed per 1,000 ml. In water less developing system, it is recommended that ratio of the capacity of the container for waste color developing solution to that of the container for waste bleach fixing and stabilizing solutions should be within the range of 1 6 to 2 3, and in the Example shown, the capacities of the first and second containers were 2 and 6 liters, respectively. The volume of the waste color developing solution amounted to 2,000 ml while that of the waste bleach fixing and stabilizing solutions combined was 6,200 ml. The bleach fixing and stabilizing solutions spilled from the conventional container using no absorber resin, thereby fouling the working environment. The container of the waste color developing solution could be taken out of the automatic developer without causing any spillage but this was possible only after great care and prolonged time were spent. The same experiment was conducted with 7 g of Sumika Gel S 50 put in the container for waste color developing solution and 25 g of the same gel in the container for combined waste bleach fixing and stabilizing solutions. A thousand color papers of the cabinet size could be smoothly processed without fouling the working environment. In addition, both containers could be replaced in a short time without fouling the operator s hands or clothes. An additional 200 color prints were processed by the method of the present invention and, surprisingly enough, no spillage of waste working solutions occurred and the working environment was kept clean. The resins which had absorbed the waste working solutions could be left for a week without causing any tar formation or precipitation. The resins that had absorbed the waste working solutions resulting from the processing of 1,000 color prints in Example 1 could be readily incinerated at 700 1,000 C. The silver in the working solutions could be recovered from the ash in the incineration residue. In an alternative method, the silver in the ash was dissolved in nitric acid and the solution was electrolyzed for silver recovery. In accordance with the present invention, waste photo graphic working solutions are absorbed by resins of high liquid absorbing performance to produce a solid form which is easy to handle and can be discarded or incinerated as it is put in a flexible container or paper bag. Unlike the conventional method which handles waste solutions in a liquid form, the method of the present invention allows the waste solutions to be recovered safely without causing splashes. Furthermore, since containers for the waste solutions can be increased in size both horizontally and vertically, a larger accommodation capacity can be readily attained, thereby minimizing the need for using an alarm sensor or the possibility of the waste solutions fouling the floor on which the automatic processor is installed.
