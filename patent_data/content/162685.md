## Description
This invention relates to a novel composition, element and method using particular leuco dyes to detect hydrogen peroxide or another analyte which reacts to produce hydrogen peroxide in the analysis of liquids, e.g. biological fluids. This invention is particularly useful in clinical chemistry. The detection or quantitative determination of hydrogen peroxide and compounds yielding hydrogen peroxide as a result of chemical or enzymatic reactions is of importance in many areas. For example, they are important in the detection of hydrogen peroxide produced in the enzymatic assay of chemical or biological substances sometimes called analytes such as glucose, cholesterol, uric acid, triglycerides, creatine kinase, etc. in the presence of oxygen. The quantity of analyte present in a specimen sample is determinable from the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced and detected. Known compositions for detecting or quantifying hydrogen peroxide in such assays generally comprise a substance having peroxidative activity, e.g. peroxidase, and a material which undergoes a detectable change e.g. a color change in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and the peroxidative substance. Various materials which undergo such a detectable change include monoamines, diamines, phenols, leuco dyes and other known dyes or dye formers. Triarylmethane dyes and their leuco precursors are also known as commercially useful compounds. Triarylmethane leuco dyes, far example, are known as useful indicators of hydrogen peroxide. Examples of such leuco dyes include the following compounds Leuco form of Acid Dye 3040. However, it has been observed that such leuco dyes readily oxidize in air or in aqueous solutions containing a substance having peroxidative activity see e.g. Example 1 below . Hence, this instability renders them unsuitable for analytical determinations, and especially for dry assays where the analytical composition is stored for a period of time prior to use. Although other dye providing materials have the desired stability and are, in general, useful as indicators for hydrogen peroxide determination, there are instances when the concentration of hydrogen peroxide to be analyzed is too low to produce sufficient detectable color from such indicators. In some instances, this shortcoming can be overcome by using increased amounts of indicator. However, where the analyte concentration is initially low or high dilution of the test sample is required, such indicators may still be deficient because they still provide insufficient detectable color in such instances. Such problems of instability and low analyte concentration are particularly acute when analyte determination is attempted with a dry analytical element, for example, with the commercially successful elements described in US A 3,992,158. In such instances, the indicator or reagent layer present in such elements is necessarily very thin, and the dye concentration is relatively low. Hence, the density of the color formed can be rather low even with high analyte concentrations. However, it would be desirable to use such elements for very low analyte concentrations. US A 4,407,960 describes Michler s hydrol leuco benzotriazole as useful in ethanol or acetone as an indicator of sterilization. It would be desirable to have leuco dyes useful in aqueous systems which can be used to detect hydrogen peroxide in the presence of peroxidase. The problems noted above are solved by use of a composition for determination of hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous liquid comprising a substance having peroxidative activity. The composition is characterized by comprising a tri substituted methane leuco dye having the structure I wherein R is furyl, thienyl, selenophenyl, pyridyl, pyrindinyl, pyrimidyl, triazinyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, selenazolyl, pyranyl, pyrazinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, tetrazinyl, pyridazinyl, quinazolinyl, acridinyl, benzothiazolyl, quinoxalinyl, cinnolinyl, phthalazinyl, pteridinyl, phenazinyl, N methylpyrrole, , N methylindole, N methylimidazole and N methylbenzimidazole, any of which can be substituted or unsubstituted, The leuco dye provides a dye having a maximum absorption at a wavelength equal to or greater than 600 nm upon interaction with hydrogen peroxide. The dye suitable for use in the present invention may be described as a triarylmethane leuco dye having an aromatic heterocyclic moiety attached to the central methane carbon atom. Another feature of this invention is a dry analytical element for determination of hydrogen peroxide or an analyte which reacts to produce hydrogen peroxide. Such element comprises a substance having peroxidative activity and a triarylmethane leuco dye described in the preceding paragraph. A method for determining hydrogen peroxide or an analyte which reacts to produce hydrogen peroxide in a liquid comprises the steps of A. physically contacting a sample of the liquid with a substance having peroxidative activity and the leuco dye described above, and B. detecting the resulting dye at a wavelength equal to or greater than 600 nm. The present invention utilizes a particular class of leuco dyes which are unexpectedly stable to oxidation in air and in the presence of a peroxidative substance, but which can be advantageously used to detect low levels of hydrogen peroxide or analytes which react to produce hydrogen peroxide in both solution and dry assays. Advantageously, dyes obtained from these compounds have a maximum absorption at or above 600 nm thereby avoiding potential spectral interferents commonly found in biological fluids. These compounds are particularly useful for the determination of hydrogen peroxide generated by one or more i.e. coupled or uncoupled enzymatic reactions in response to an analyte such as glucose, galactose, amino acids, uric acid, triglycerides, creatine kinase, cholesterol and other analytes. The leuco dyes useful in the practice of this invention are triarylmethane compounds which have an aromatic heterocyclic moiety attached to the central methane carbon. These leuco dyes provide dyes, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, which have a maximum absorption at a wavelength equal to or greater than 600 nm. The leuco dyes also have two phenyl groups attached to the central methane carbon. Each phenyl group has an amino group primary, secondary or tertiary which is attached to the phenyl ring in the As used herein, a cyclic amine is represented by the structure wherein Z represents the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur or selenium atoms necessary to complete, with the illustrated nitrogen atom, a 5 to 15 membered monoheterocyclic ring, as further identified below for R¹, R², R³ and R⁴. The leuco dyes preferred in the practice of this invention have the structure II wherein R, X, X , Y, and Y are as defined above. R can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents such as alkyl preferably of 1 to 18 carbon atoms , aryl preferably of 6 to 14 carbon atoms, for example, phenyl or xylyl , alkoxy preferably of 1 to 18 carbon atoms, for example, methoxy, propoxy or In the above identified structure II, R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are independently Alternatively, R¹ and R² taken together, and R³ and R⁴ taken together can represent, with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, the atoms needed to complete a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic ring, preferably of 5 to 15 atoms that is, carbon, oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen, selenium atoms , for example, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, julolidinyl or piperazinyl. Preferably, R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are independently substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyls of 1 to 6 carbon atoms for example, methyl, chloromethyl, ethyl or hexyl . More preferably R¹ is the same as R³ and R² is the same as R⁴. Most preferably, each of these groups is the same. The arylene rings of the leuco dyes illustrated above can be further substituted, if desired, in the positions Upon oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and a substance having peroxidative activity for example, peroxidase , the leuco dyes are converted to detectable dyes which have a maximum absorption at or above 600 nm. This feature is advantageous in that dye detection is not hindered by certain spectral interferents for example, hemoglobin or bilirubin commonly found in biological fluids. The following equation illustrates the conversion of leuco dye to positively charged detectable dye wherein X is a suitable monovalent anion for example, halide, perchlorate or Representative leuco dyes are listed in Table I below in reference to the compound structure II given above. Leuco dyes I and II are preferred. The leuco dyes useful in the practice of this invention can be readily prepared using commercially available or readily prepared starting materials. They can be prepared using synthetic procedures well known in the art as illustrated, for example, in US A 3,995,088. In general, the leuco dyes of structure II are prepared by reacting a mole of an aldehyde of the formula RCHO with two moles of an amine or a mixture of amines that is, 2 moles of if R¹ is the same as R³ and R² is the same as R⁴, or a 1 1 molar mixture of if R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ are different in the presence of a suitable catalyst for example, ZnCl₂ . The analytical composition of this invention can be used in both solution and dry element assays, and comprises a leuco dye as described above, a substance having peroxidative activity, and optionally but preferably, a buffer which maintains a pH of from about 4 to about 9 in the composition when it is used in either solution or dry assay. Substances having peroxidative activity useful in the practice of this invention are also known as peroxidative substances and are capable of catalyzing the oxidation of another substance by means of hydrogen peroxide and other peroxides. Such substances include natural and synthetic peroxidases, cytochromes, hemin, forms of hemoglobin, alkaline hematin, iron sulfocyanate, iron tannate, chromic salts and the like. Peroxidase is a particularly useful peroxidative substance. Substantially any buffer is useful in the composition of this invention. Useful buffers provide a pH in the composition which is conducive to dye formation. Generally, the pH is within the range of from 4 to 9, but a specific pH will depend to some extent on the particular analyte being assayed. For example, when used to detect uric acid using uricase, it is preferred to buffer the composition at a pH between 8 and 9. Useful buffers include carbonates, borates, phosphates, glutarates, the tris materials, e.g. tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane and others known in the art. The compositions of this invention can be prepared for use in a solution assay by mixing the peroxidative substance generally in an aqueous solution with the leuco dye. Since the leuco dyes have limited solubility in water, they can be dissolved in a water miscible solvent, such as an alcohol or N,N dimethylformamide, prior to mixing with the peroxidative substance. The details of preparing a representative hydrogen peroxide determining composition are given in Example 2 below. When the compositions of this invention are used in solution assays, generally the leuco dye is present in a concentration of up to 0.1, and preferably from 0.02 to 0.05, mg mℓ of solution. Similarly, the peroxidative substance is present in an amount sufficient to catalyze the leuco dye dye reaction. For example, peroxidase is present in an amount up to 1, and preferably from 0.1 to 0.5, I.U. mℓ. The amounts of the optional composition components e.g. buffer, surfactant, etc. and of the interactive composition described below are within the skill of a worker in the art. The compositions of this invention can be used to determine an analyte which is capable of producing hydrogen peroxide, i.e. it can participate in a reaction or series of reactions which produce hydrogen peroxide, in an aqueous liquid by including in such compositions an interactive composition which produces hydrogen peroxide upon interaction with the analyte. Analytes which can be determined in this manner include glucose, triglycerides, uric acid, cholesterol, galactose, amino acids, creatine kinase, and others known to one skilled in the clinical chemistry art. For example, an interactive composition for determining uric acid includes uricase, and an interactive composition for determining cholesterol includes cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol ester hydrolase. Further, an interactive composition for determining creatine kinase includes glycerol kinase, adenosine triphosphate and α glycerophosphate oxidase. Other interactive compositions can be fashioned for a given analyte by those skilled in the art. The compositions and method of this invention are adaptable to both solution and dry element assays. In a solution assay, generally the leuco dye, peroxidative substance and interactive composition, if included, are physically contacted and mixed with a liquid test sample in a suitable container e.g. test tube, petric dish, beaker, cuvette, etc. . The resulting solution is incubated for a relatively short time at a suitable temperature. The sample is then evaluated by measuring the amount of dye provided upon interaction with hydrogen peroxide. The amount of dye can then be correlated to the amount of hydrogen peroxide either initially present in the sample, or produced as a result of the presence of an analyte. Such an evaluation can be done with suitable colorimetric detection equipment and procedures. Alternatively, the composition and method of this invention can be utilized with a dry analytical element which can be an absorbent carrier matrix, i.e. thin sheet or self supporting absorbent or bibulous material, such as filter paper or strips, which contains the leuco dye with or without the peroxidative substance. Preferably, such elements also contain the peroxidative substance. Such elements are known in the art as test strips, diagnostic elements, dip sticks, diagnostic agents and the like. When employed in dry chemistry elements, the reagents can be incorporated into a suitable carrier matrix by imbibition, impregnation, coating or another suitable technique. Useful carrier matrices are insoluble and maintain their structural integrity when exposed to water or physiological fluids such as urine or serum. Useful carrier matrices can be prepared from paper, porous particulate structures, porous polymeric films, cellulose, wood, glass fiber, woven and nonwoven fabrics synthetic and nonsynthetic and the like. A useful dry analytical element is made by imbibing a solution of the reagent composition into the matrix and drying. Useful materials and procedures for making such elements are well known in the art as exemplified in US A 3,092,465 US A 3,802,842 US A 3,915,647 US A 3,917,453 US A 3,936,357 US A 4,248,829 US A 4,255,384 and US A 4,270,920 and GB A 2,052,057. Preferably, the dry analytical elements of this invention have at least one porous spreading zone. This zone can be a self supporting absorbent carrier matrix i.e. composed of a material rigid enough to maintain its integrity , but preferably it is carried on a separate supporting substrate commonly called a support . Such a support can be any suitable dimensionally stable, and preferably, transparent i.e. radiation transmissive material which transmits electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength between 200 and 900 nm. A support of choice for a particular element should be compatible with the intended mode of detection reflection or transmission spectroscopy . Useful support materials include paper, metal foils, polystyrene, polyesters for example, poly ethylene terephthalate , polycarbonates or cellulose esters for example, cellulose acetate . The porous spreading zone can be prepared from any suitable fibrous or non fibrous material or mixtures of either or both. The void volume and average pore size of this zone can be varied depending upon the use intended. For example, if whole blood or other liquid samples containing high molecular weight materials are to be assayed, the void volume and average pore size are generally greater than if serum or urine is to be assayed. Useful spreading zones can be prepared using fibrous materials, either mixed with a suitable binder material or woven into a fabric, as described in US A 4,292,272. Alternatively, and preferably, the spreading zone is prepared from polymeric compositions for example blush polymers or particulate materials, with or without binding adhesives, as described in US A 3,992,158 and US A 4,258,001. Other useful spreading zone materials are described in DE A 3,150,102 and JP 57 1982 101760. It is desirable that the spreading zone be isotropically porous, meaning that the porosity is the same in each direction in the zone as created by interconnected spaces or pores between particles, fibers, polymeric strands, etc. The elements can have more than one zone, for example, one or more reagent zones, spreading zones, registration zones, mordant zones, radiation blocking or filter zones, subbing zones, barrier zones, buffer zones, etc. The zones are generally in fluid contact with each other meaning that fluids, reagents and reaction products can pass between superposed regions of adjacent zones. Preferably, the zones are separately coated layers, although two or more zones can be a single layer, or a zone can contain two or more separate layers. Besides the references noted above, suitable element formats and components are described, for example, in US A 4,042,335 US A 4,132,528 and US A 4,144,306. The components of the compositions of this invention, i.e. peroxidative substance, leuco dye, interactive composition if present , buffer if present , etc. can be incorporated in any of the zones of the elements that would be suitable for the particular analysis. The location of individual components is within the skill of a worker in the clinical chemistry art. In the elements of this invention, the amount of the leuco dye can be varied widely, but it is generally present in a coverage of up to 5, and preferably from 0.01 to 2.5 g m². The leuco dyes can be ball milled directly into the spreading or reagent layer material, or dissolved in a high boiling coupler solvent and dispersed in the layer. Useful coupler solvents include tri One embodiment of this invention is a multilayer dry analytical element for determining an analyte. This element comprises a support having thereon, in order and in fluid contact, a hydrophilic layer containing a hydrophilic binder material natural or synthetic , such as gelatin or polyacrylamide, and a spreading reagent layer containing 1 an interactive composition which produces hydrogen peroxide upon interaction with the analyte, 2 a substance having peroxidative activity, and 3 a leuco dye as described above. A variety of different elements, depending on the method of assay, can be prepared in accordance with the present invention. Elements can be configured in a variety of forms, including elongated tapes of any desired width, sheets, slides or chips. The assay of this invention can be manual or automated. In general, in using the dry elements, hydrogen peroxide or analyte determination is made by taking the element from a supply roll, chip packet or other source and physically contacting it with a sample e.g. 1 100 µℓ of the liquid to be tested. Such contact can be accomplished in any suitable manner, e.g. dipping or immersing the element into the sample or, preferably, by spotting the element by hand or machine with a drop of the sample with a suitable dispensing means. After sample application, the element is exposed to any conditioning, such as incubation, heating or the like, that may be desirable to quicken or otherwise facilitate obtaining any test result. Determination of hydrogen peroxide or an analyte is achieved when the leuco dye is oxidized to provide a detectable dye. This dye can be detected with the unaided eye or with suitable spectrophotometric means and procedures. Generally, the dyes formed in the practice of this invention have a λ The following preparations and examples are provided to illustrate the practice of the invention. In those examples, Estane was obtained from B. F. Goodrich Cleveland, Ohio , Alkanol XC was obtained from E.I. duPont Wilmington, Delaware , Surfactant 10G was obtained from Olin Mathieson Co. Stamford, Connecticut , and Triton X 102, Triton X 100 and Triton X 200 were obtained from Rohm Haas Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Peroxidase was obtained from Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, Indiana. Glycerol kinase was obtained from Beckman Clinical Diagnostics Division Carlsbad, California . All other reagents including enzymes were obtained from Aldrich Chemicals Co. Milwaukee, Wisconsin , Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, Missouri or Eastman Kodak Company Rochester, New York . Air stability of both the leuco dyes useful in the practice of this invention and those known in the art was demonstrated by allowing a sample of each leuco dye to be exposed to air for several weeks. Only slight oxidation, as evidenced by a slight color formation, was observed in the case of the leuco dyes useful in this invention. The leuco dyes tested in the following examples were stable in the analytical solutions and elements prepared until oxidized by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of peroxidase. Leuco dyes outside the scope of this invention, e.g. leuco malachite green and leuco crystal violet, were readily oxidized in air. The maximum absorption of the dyes formed by the leuco dyes useful in this invention were measured in the following manner a stock solution of 1 5 mg of the leuco dye in 100 mℓ of methanol was prepared. Ten mℓ of the stock solution was mixed with 0.1 mℓ of an aqueous solution of peroxidase 100 International units per mℓ of water and 0.1 mℓ of a 0.1 molar hydrogen peroxide solution. The resulting solution was diluted to 50 mℓ with methanol and water, and after 2 hours, the resulting spectra were determined in a conventional Carey spectrophotometer. A mixture of 4 pyridinecarboxaldehyde 11 g , N,N dimethylaniline 25 g and anhydrous zinc chloride 5 g was heated under a nitrogen atmosphere at 150 C for two hours. The resulting hot melt was poured into water and the mixture was made strongly alkaline by the addition of dilute sodium hydroxide. This mixture was then steam distilled to remove excess dimethylaniline. After cooling, the water was decanted from the residue yielding a sticky solid. This solid was dissolved in ethanol and filtered to remove zinc oxide. The filtrate was cooled, diluted with water and allowed to stand until crystallization of the product was complete. The product was collected and recrystallized from acetonitrile to yield 10 g of leuco dye I. Mass spectral analysis showed a parent ion at m e 331 and no recognizable impurities. The leuco dye was very stable in air and the maximum absorption of the corresponding dye was at 630 nm. This compound was prepared in a manner similar to the preparation of leuco dye I, but using 3 pyridinecarboxaldehyde. The resulting product had a m.p. of 187 189 C and mass spectral analysis showed a parent ion at m e 331 and no recognizable impurities. The leuco dye was very stable in air and the corresponding dye had a maximum absorption at 632 nm. A mixture of 2 furaldehyde 10 g , N,N dimethylaniline 30 g and anhydrous zinc chloride 14 g was heated together at 100 C under a nitrogen atmosphere until essentially all of the aldehyde was consumed, as indicated on thin layer chromatography TLC silica, 4 1 toluene ethyl acetate . The reaction time was about 2 hours. Dilute potassium hydroxide solution was then added, and the resulting solution was steam distilled to remove excess N,N dimethylaniline. The residue was extracted with ethyl acetate, filtered and the organic layer separated. After drying over magnesium sulfate, the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue crystallized on cooling, and was recrystallized from ethyl alcohol. The yield was 15 g and TLC analysis showed one major spot. Mass spectral analysis showed a parent ion at m e 336 and no recognizable impurities. This leuco dye was very stable to air. The maximum absorption of the corresponding dye was at 628 nm. Acetone 58 g was brominated according to the procedure described by C. Rappe in This compound 145 g was reacted with 69 g according to the procedure described by Baganz and Rüger in Intermediate B 44 g was converted to 29 g of Intermediate C in the presence of sulfuric acid as described by Baganz et al, according to Baganz et al, A mixture of Intermediate D 13 g , N,N dimethylaniline 20 g and anhydrous zinc chloride 10 g was heated to 120 C. A vigorous reaction commenced and water was expelled from the mixture. After the reaction had subsided, the mixture was heated to 150 C for a few minutes. The resulting viscous syrup was poured into a dilute potassium hydroxide solution with stirring. The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, the solvent was dried and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue solidified on addition of a small amount of ethyl alcohol. Recrystallization from acetonitrile gave 15 g of leuco dye V. TLC silica, 4 1 toluene ethyl acetate showed one product. Mass spectral analysis showed one parent ion at m e 413 and no recognizable impurities. The leuco dye was very stable to air. The maximum absorption of the corresponding dye was at 635 nm. This is a comparison of the stability of a leuco dye useful in the practice of this invention to a known leuco dye, leuco naphthalene green V which has the structure A test solution was prepared from 0.1 mℓ of a 5 mmolar solution of leuco naphthalene green V and 0.8 mℓ of 50 mmolar phosphate buffer pH 7 . Upon addition of 0.01 mℓ peroxidase 2 µg mℓ , dye formation was observed within 5 minutes, indicating instability of the leuco dye in the presence of a peroxidative material. In contrast, leuco dye II which is useful in this invention, when treated in a similar manner, did not produce dye after one hour. A leuco dye within the scope of this invention was used to determine hydrogen peroxide in solution in the following manner. A 0.3 mℓ aliquot of a stock methanol solution of leuco dye II 5 mmolar was diluted 10 1 with aqueous buffer solution pH 7 , then 0.1 mℓ of an aqueous peroxidase solution 100 International units of peroxidase per mℓ of water , and 0.1 mℓ of a 0.1 molar hydrogen peroxide solution were added. Dye formation was observed after about 5 minutes with this composition. In contrast, no dye was observed after 60 minutes when the dye was mixed with only the buffer or peroxidase or both. A leuco dye useful in this invention was used to assay for glucose in solution by the following procedure. Two stock solutions were prepared. Stock solution A contained 50 mℓ of potassium phosphate buffer pH 7 and 10 mℓ of a methanol solution of leuco dye II 21.9 mg of leuco dye 100 mℓ of methanol . Stock solution B contained 5 mℓ of potassium phosphate buffer pH 7 , peroxidase 120 I.U. mℓ and glucose oxidase 100 I.U. mℓ . A control solution was prepared from 1 mℓ of solution A, 1 mℓ of solution B and 1.4 mℓ of distilled water. A test solution was prepared from 1 mℓ of solution A, 1 mℓ of solution B, 1 mℓ of distilled water and 0.4 mℓ of glucose solution 10 mmolar . The optical density of the control and test solutions were then measured at 25 C at 632 nm in a commercially available Carey spectrophotometer. The difference in density between the two solutions after one minute was 0.12 optical units indicating that the test solution of this invention was useful for determination of glucose. Leuco dyes I VI were used to determine hydrogen peroxide with individual multilayer analytical elements by incorporating each leuco dye into an individual element, contacting those elements with solutions containing hydrogen peroxide and measuring the reflection density of the resulting dye. Each analytical element had the following format The elements were evaluated using two hydrogen peroxide test solutions, Test solution A pH 5 contained 5 x 10 ² molar dimethylglutaric acid and 10 ² molar hydrogen peroxide. Test solution B pH 7 contained 5 x 10 ² molar sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 5 x 10 ² molar potassium hydrogen phosphate and 10 ² molar hydrogen peroxide. Water was used as a control liquid. Ten µℓ of each solution were spotted onto individual samples of the elements containing the respective leuco dyes. After 5 minutes incubation at 37 C, the reflection density was measured in a modified conventional reflectometer at 630 nm. Table II below shows the change in reflection density ΔD An analytical element was prepared as shown in the following format. To evaluate this coated element, a series of triglyceride calibrator fluids, varying in analyte concentration from 17.4 mg mℓ to 565.8 mg dℓ, were prepared, and samples of the element were spotted with 10 µℓ drops of each calibrator fluid. After 5 minutes incubation at 37 C, the reflection density D
