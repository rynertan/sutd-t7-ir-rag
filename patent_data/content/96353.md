# A RADIO FREQUENCY NOISE SUPPRESSIVE IGNITION SYSTEM FOR AN AUTOMOTIVE VEHICLE S ENGINE

## Abstract
A radio frequency noise suppressive ignition system for an automotive vehicle s engine, comprising a plurality of spark plugs 1 each installed within a corresponding engine cylinder having an elongated monolithic resistor 7 equal to or more than eight millimeter long, noise suppressive resistance contained high tension cables 13 , one of which being connected between a secondary winding of an ignition coil 27 and distributor 24 , the others of which being connected between a plurality of fixed electrodes 17 of the distributor 24 and respectuve spark plugs 1 , the distribu tor 24 having a rotor 22 electrically connected to a center electrode 16 via a contactor 19 made of a high resistance material which is connected to the secondary winding of the ignition coil 27 , the rotor 22 including a rotor electrode 21 having a discharge gap 20 against each of the fixed electrodes 17 and a dielectric material 25 preferably made of silicone glass secured to a portion of at least one of the top and bottom surface areas of the rotor electrode 21 , and a resistance material 29 provided at an intermediate part of the rotor electrode 21 between one end of the rotor electrode 21 which is connected to the contactor 19 and the portion of the rotor electrode 21 to which the dielectric material 25 is secured.
