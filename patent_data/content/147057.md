# CONTAINER HAVING A METAL BODY ATTACHED TO A POLYMERIC COMPONENT

## Abstract
A container for an aqueous or non aqueous product, such as a paint, has a tubular metal body with at least one component of a polymeric material attached thereto, such as pivot lugs 28 for a carrying handle or a top ring 141 for receiving a conventional plug type lid or a base member 29 of the container. The polymeric component or components is or are attached to respective bare metal portions of the surface of the metal body 10 by means of an adhesive essentially composed of a polyolefin chemically modified to increase the content of polar groups so as to promote development of bond strength between the polymeric component and the metal. The polymeric material of the components may be a propylene based polymer or copoly mer or a polyamide nylon and the adhesive a polypropy lene modified by a maleic anhydride graft.
