## Description
Description of the invention entitled DEVICE TO PARK THE DUMMY BAR DOWNSTREAM FROM THE EXTRACTION.AND STRAIGHTENING GROUP This invention concerns a parking device for the dummy. bar normally used to withdraw the continuous billet in conti . .nuous casting plants. To be more exact, the invention concerns a structure that swings between two positions, whereby the first position.is used to park the dummy bar during its phase of rest,where as the second position is employed to support and guide said..dummy bar during the phase of initial insertion thereof and also during the phase of starting the continuous billet here .inafter called billet . In the art of continuous casting the molten metal is conveyed in a wheeled ladle or by a crane to an ingot mould .having an open bottom and suitable shape and located above .the casting line. Said ingot mould receives the molten metal from said ladle through a pre heated tundish and discharges said metal..downwards through its open bottom in a partly solidified con sinuous flow of a pre set section said flow becomes gradually solidified on the casting line with the help of suitable cool .ing means located in the first part of said casting line. It is necessary to close the open bottom of the ingot.mould temporarily before beginning the casting so as to pre ..vent a disorderly flow of the metal. The open bottom of the ingot mould is closed by means of a dummy bar, which is inserted by a group of entraining rollers into the open bottom of the ingot mould, and any gap.created between the dummy bar and the open bottom is sealed .with suitable refractory material. The first part of the metal poured into the ingot mould thus closed is left to solidify partially so as to become united to the head of the dummy bar. Following on the filling of the ingot mould and the oscillation thereof to hinder the formation of a crust of me tal on its inner walls, the entraining rollers are actuated and arrange to pull the dummy bar and withdraw the billet connected to the end of said bar. The dummy bar is detached from the billet thereafter and is parked in a suitable position near the extraction group and discharge line, along which the cast metal goes on travel .ling for the rolling processes which follow thereafter. Said dummy bar, now having a new head, is taken once again from its parking device at the beginning of the next .casting and the foregoing procedure to start the billet is .followed once more. Known dummy bars are substantially of three kinds .rigid bow shaped dummy bars, semi rigid bow shaped dummy bars consisting of a number of articulated segments and flexible chain type dummy bars. The known systems to park rigid dummy bars or semi .rigid dummy bars in segments require a fixed supporting struct .ure which is shaped like a bow, lies on the vertical plane of the casting line, stretches upwards from the extraction group and ends at a point having a height not less than the height..of the ingot mould.Patents US 3,930,533 Rokop , US 3,433,287 GreenbergerY and US 3,344,844 Reinfeld and others , which describe systems for parking dummy bars of this type, reveal some problems re latin to the bulky construction, heavy weight and unsatisfac .tory lay out of said fixed bow shaped structures. Patent US 3,682,233 Rokop and others claims a system .to park flexible dummy bars which consists of a substantially..upright fixed structure with a horizontal tract, the structure being located above the extraction group and casting line, whereby a secondary entraining group is lodged in the horizontal tract so as to move the dummy bar within said bearing str,uc ture. Notwithstanding the advantages offered by this system by.way of a lesser bulk than in said known systems, yet this sys,tem still takes up a great deal of space and is only fit for ,flexible dummy bars. Indeed, the structure proposed in this patent stretches.vertically above the ingot mould and takes up much useful spa .ce both near the extraction group and near the upper part of the casting plant. One problem common to the foregoing known parking systems lies in the fact that the new head of the dummy bar can be .fitted only near the extraction group. It is the purpose of our invention to embody a device to. park dummy bars which swings between a raised position of rest and a lower working position and which is able to take up less space than known parking systems and to be lighter and cheaper to make. One advantage lies in the fact that the invention enables .a new head to be fitted to the dummy bar in its raised posit . .ion far from the extraction group during the phase of rest.This leads to a great saving of time and therefore to high output.Another advantage is the free space created near the ex .traction group and discharge line during casting this space.can be employed for other more useful purposes. Our invention is therefore embodied with a device to park dummy barswhich can be used in continuous casting mach , ines with a casting line on rollers stretching between the in .got mould and the substantially horizontal outlet and compris ing an extraction and straightening group located at said out .let,said device being characterized by including in working combination a swinging supporting structure to park the dummy bar,where by said structure is revolvably supported in its upper part downstream from said extraction group and can rotate between a raised position of rest and a lowered working position, oscillator means able to rotate said supporting structure between its position of rest and working position, and means able to pull and clamp the dummy bar on said support ing structure, said means being anchored to said structure,. .whereby means are also envisaged for controlling and coordinsating the actuation of said oscillator means and said means which pull and clamp the dummy bar, in relation to the overall working of the casting machine. In a preferential embodiment of the invention said sup .porting structure consists of a cradle structure with a sub . stantially bow shaped profile and with a U shaped section, .whereby said cradle structure comprises a tubular element through which the rotation shaft passes and which is solidly.fixed to the upper part of the two vertical sides of said structure, and whereby the cradle structure includes one or more integral levers stretching outwards and radially in re . .lation to said tubular element and cooperating at their end with said oscillator means anchored to the fixed structure of the machine on which said cradle structure pivots, and whereby said cradle structure in its turn bears means to pull and clamp the dummy bar which are able to effect any displace menus of the dummy bar and the clamping thereof during the .phase of rest. The pulling of the dummy bar along the casting line and.the loading thereof on the supporting cradle structure are carried out advantageously by the group which extracts the continuous billet. We shall describe hereinafter a preferential embodiment. .of our invention as a non restrictive example and shall refer to the attached tables, wherein ,Fig.I gives a side view of the continuous casting machine with the cradle structure to park the dummy bar accor ding to the invention Big.2 gives a view in the direction of the arrow C of Fig.I and shows only said cradle structure in its horizontal position where said structure is shown in Fig.I with. lines of dashes in its position of rest Fig. shows the tail of the dummy bar. In the figures the same parts or parts having the same functions bear the same reference numbers. In Figs.I and 2, the device IO which parks the dummy bar .11 is located downstream from and above the group I2 that ex tracts and straightens the true billet or continuous billet 13 in a continuous casting machine consisting of a ladle 14, tundish I5 and an ingot mould I6 having an open bottom and positioned on the casting line I7 equipped with rollers 18 and with a curved guide II8, said line I7 having in its first .tract a cooling chamber I9, whereby there could be an oscil . slating group which acts on said ingot mould 16. Downstream from the group I2 extracting and straightening the billet is positioned the roller discharge table 20 on which the billet runs after the dummy bar has been detached with known unfastening means generically indicated with It2.. In the example shown said group that unfastens the dummy .bar II is part of the extraction and straightening group 12 and acts so that the head of the dummy bar anchored to the actual billet I3, when unfastened, is separated from said dum my bar II, which goes without its head onto the parking device 10 and lets the actual billet run along the roller discharge.table 20 for the processing phases thereafter. The parking device 10, shown in Figs.I and 2 and the pur, pose of our invention, consists of a swinging supporting structure 21 having a cradle shaped structure I2I with a substant , ,wally bow shaped bottom equipped with a plurality of idler rol. lers 22 and with two upright sides 22I connected together at.their end with crosswise elements not shown here , whereby a crosswise tubular element 32I is envisaged and is anchored.at its ends to said upright sides 22I in their upper part.Thus the cradle structure I2I has a substantially U shaped section. Said tubular element 32I has at its ends two levers 421. which stretch out radially in relation to said tubular element 321 so as to form a fork together with said tubular element 321. Said levers 421 are preferably tilted in relation to the upper edge of said upright sides 221. The two sides 221, tubular element 321 and two levers 421 form the unitary cradle structure I2I. Said cradle structure 12I is arranged revolvably on the bearing structure 22 of the machine at a point above the discharge line 20 and just downstream from the extraction and straightening group I2. Said anchorage point consists of a pivot I22 on which the tubular element 321 of the cradle I2I revolves. Figs.I and 2 .show a preferential but not restrictive embodiment of the oscillator means 24 which can actuate the rotation of the cra .dle structure 21 between a horizontal raised position of rest shown with lines of dashes and another sloped working position in which the end B of the cradle structure lies in correspond .ence with the outlet of the extraction and straightening group 12. In our example said oscillator means 24 consist of a hy draulic or pneumatic jack I24 anchored at one end to the bearing structure of the machine 22 by a suitable support 222, while the stem 224 of said jack I24 pivots at 322 on a cross wise shaft 425 solidly fixed at its ends to the free end of .each of said levers 42I, so that said stem 224 can actuate the rotation of the cradle structure I2I around said pivot .122. According to the invention said cradle structure I2I also comprises means 25 suitable for pulling and clamping the dummy bar II on said cradle structure I2I.Said pulling and clamping means 25 only start working when the dummy bar is out of the rea of the extraction and straightening group I2, and serve to pull the dummy bar II .and hinder the return thereof, after its head has been detach .ed, to said extraction and straightening group I2. In our example said pulling and clamping means 25 com .prise a jack I25 pivoting at one end at 225 on the cradle .structure I21 said jack I25 cooperates with an arm 325 swings ing at 326 on a shaft 426 anchored at its ends to two supports 525 which are an integral part of the cradle structure 121. Said cooperation between the swinging arm 325 and jack 125 takes place through the articulation of the stem 251 at the point 252 located between the free end 327 of the arm 325 and the point of rotation 326 of said arm 325. The free end 327 of said arm 325 is a hook wise end and.can lodge itself in an upright notch 211 located lengthwise in the tail 411 of the dummy bar II and can cooperate with a.pin 311 located crosswise within said notch 211, as shown in..Fig.3. Said pulling means 25 are required to provide a thrust only in an upwards direction and are inactive when the dummy bar has to be inserted in the extraction and straightening group, to which the dummy bar II descends, taking with it the free end 327 of the swinging arm 325, from which it is automa tically detached when said arm 325 reaches the stop at the lower end of its run. It is best for us to emphasise that the clamping action. of the means 25 is only necessary when the cradle structure 12I is in its sloping position since in the position of rest, the dummy bar stays still within said structure, where the .fitting of its head III is prepared in a raised working sta . .tion near which the end B of the cradle structure I2I halts. When the dummy bar II is to be inserted during the ready ing of the machine at the beginning of casting, the cradle .structure I2I, taking with it the dummy bar II complete with..a removable head III, is driven by the oscillator means 24 so as to take up its working position. Said bar II stays attached to said cradle structure I2I. Owing to the clamping action of the means 25. When the working position is reached, the jack I25 is disactivated and enables the arm 325 to revolve clockwise under the action of the weight of the dummy bar, which inserts .itself in the extraction and straightening group I2 and enters upon its field of work. The group I9 pulls the dummy bar II along the casting line I7 until its head III is inserted into the bottom of the ingot mould I6. V.Een the first casting phase ends, the dummy bar II, of, which the tail has stayed during said phase between the entraining rollers 2I2 of the extraction and straightening group .12, is withdrawn and thrust along the cradle wise parking structure I2I, which is lying in its working position. When the head III of the dummy bar reaches said extract .ion rollers 212, the pin 311 provided in the tail 411 of the, .dummy bar II lies near the bottom dead centre of the hook like end 327 of the swinging arm 325, said end 327 being now in a, raised and retracted position. The jack I25 now starts working, rotates said arm 325 anti clockwise and forces said arm to hook itself onto the pin 311 of the dummy bar II and to pull said dummy bar II upwards while its head III is still anchored to the billet 13. When said head III reaches the means 112 that unfasten the head, the dummy bar II is freed in a known way and conti nues its path along the cradle structure I2I until the swing .ing ars 325 reaches its top dead centre, where said arm 325 is clamped by the jack 125 and at the same time hinders the return of the dummy bar II downwards. The actual billet I3, instead, goes on moving along the roller discharge table 20. The oscillator means 24 now start working and, by the actuation of the two way jack I24, revolve the cradle struct ure I2I and therewith the dummy bar into the raised parking position or position of rest, where a new head III is fitted. and made ready for the next casting. We have described herein a preferential embodiment of the .invention, but further variants are possible. The shape and constructional features of the swinging cradle structure I2I can be varied, and other kinds of actuate .tion means can be envisaged for performing the action of the.oscillator means 24 and pulling and clamping means 25, said other kinds of actuation means being able to cooperate with flexible dummy bars of the types having articulated segments, or chains, the whole being possible for a person skilled in this field without departing thereby from the scope of the inventive idea of this invention.
