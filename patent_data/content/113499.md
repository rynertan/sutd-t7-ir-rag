# Ink jet printer.

## Abstract
An ink jet printer for depositing drops of ink at a plurality of print positions on a moving print receiving medium 10 includes a print head 12 producing at least one jet drop stream 14 directed toward the medium and a charge electrode 28 positioned adjacent the point of drop forma tion of the jet drop stream. A charging means 50 repetitive ly applies a high guard drop potential to the charge electrode 28 during formation of at least every second drop for charging of the drops to a guard charge level. During formation of the remainder of the drops, either one of a number of relatively low print potentials or a substantially larger catch potential is applied to the charge electrode. Drops formed during application of a print potential to the electrode may carry a charge of either electrical polarity due the drop to drop cross talk from previously formed guard drops. Drops carrying a guard charge level and drops carrying a catch charge level are deflected by an electric field to a catcher 30 , and drops carrying any of the print charge levels are deflected by the field to associated print positions on the medium 10 .
