# Paint stripping composition and method of making the same.

## Abstract
A stripping composition for paints having free carboxyl groups and a method for the manufacture of the same, provides a solution of an alkali metal hydroxide characterised in that said solution is dispersed in a thixothropic polymeric film forming agent in the dissociated state. The film forming agent may have a lower pH than that of the hydroxide and be such that the thixothropic qualities of the agent fall above a predetermined transition pH whereby the thixothropic qualities of the composition increase as the pH falls in use. The alkali metal hydroxides are preferably selected from potassium or sodium hydroxide and the solution is preferably aqueous, or aqueous alcoholic. A film forming agent may be a cross linked carboxylated acrylic copolymer utilized with an extender such as chalk.
