# Process and apparatus for making cubic boron nitride from powdered hexagonal boron nitride.

## Abstract
Cubic boron nitride has been made from powdered hexagonal boron nitride by a process which comprises vacuum firing of the HBN and conversion by high pressure high temperature processing at 55 80 kilobars and 1600 C to the reconversion temperature. The high pressure reaction cell has a special design which prevents the entrance of impurities into the sample. This cell, comprises, for example, a carbon tube 8 enclosing concentric titanium sleeve 9 . Within the cylinder defined by the tube and sleeve are the HBN sample 4 , carbon filler 3 , shielding tantalum foil discs 2 and carbon end plugs 10 . The vacuum firing is done at pressures of 10 10 ¹⁰mm Hg, 1400 1900 C, for 5 minutes 4 hours, and is believed to form a thin, free boron coating on the HBN particles. The process works on both pyrolytic turbostratic and graphitic hexagonal boron nitride. Grinding grits formed by milling cubic boron nitride chunks recovered from the high pressure high temperature process have resulted in higher grinding ratios than commercially available CBN.
