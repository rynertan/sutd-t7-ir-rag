# FOLDABLE CHAISE LONGUE

## Abstract
A chaise lounge has an open framework, main frame supported on front and back leg frame structures which are hingedly connected to the front and rear portions of the main frame. A back rest portion has a lower end hingedly connected to the main frame generally intermediate the length of the main frame and is swingable from a longitudin al position generally in the plane of the main frame to any selected one of a number of vertically inclined positions. Bale shaped front and rear leg brace frames are hingedly connected to the main frame generally intermediate the length thereof to extend in opposite directions, and each has a connecting web portion which is engageable with and disengageable from trap members fixed on the front and rear leg frames respectively at a level below the hinged connection of the front and rear leg brace frames to the main frame. Both the front and rear leg brace frames, when disengaged, are swingable upwardly toward the main frame to a nested position, and permit the front and rear leg frames to also fold upwardly toward the main frame to nested position.
