# HOT GAS FLOW GENERATOR WITH NO MOVING PARTS

## Abstract
A method is disclosed of transferring energy into a flow of air without use of rotating parts, in which an inlet flow of air is made to swirl into a first circular path moving longitudinally of a housing, heat is added to the inlet flow of air at the end of the first path to produce hot gases, and the hot gases are directed into a second swirling circular path coaxially of and within the first path and having an open interface therewith, whereby energy is transferred from the hot gases in the second path into the inlet flow of air in the first path. An embodiment of the method is disclosed in the form of a fluid mass reaction engine having an annular housing 11 including an inlet 10 thereinto and an outlet 38 therefrom, a combustion chamber 25 in the housing spaced from the inlet, spaced coaxial openings into and out of the combustion chamber, and a means for heating air flowing through said combustion chamber. A first swirling device 14 acts on air entering the inlet to produce a circular flow of air moving into the combustion chamber and having a substantial component of centrifugal velocity, a second swirling means 30 acts on hot gases flowing out of the combustion chamber to produce a swirling flow of hot gases within the incoming circular flow of air moving toward said housing inlet and having also a substantial component of centrifugal velocity. A means 32 for directing the hot gases leaving the interface to the housing outlet, and a means 35 upstream of the housing outlet for changing the swirling flow of hot gases into an essentially linear flow, provide a motive reaction jet passing through the housing outlet.
