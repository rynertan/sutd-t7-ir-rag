# Polyurethane process.

## Abstract
An improved method for preparing polyesterurethanes with p phenylene diisocyanate is realized by 1 first reacting a polyester with a molar excess of p phenylene diisocyanate to provide an isocyanate terminated polyesterurethane, which is then 2 further reacted with additional amounts of polyester used to make the polyesterurethane. The first stage polymer 1 as prepared, is liquid and stable at temperatures of reaction with additional polyester, so that a continuous commercial process is possible without the stability prob lems faced when reacting all of the polyester and p phenylene diisocyanate together to form the desired polyes terurethane.
