# Apparatus for packaging coils of sheet or strip metal.

## Abstract
Apparatus for handling and packaging coils of sheet material, especially steel strip, comprises a rotary capstan 2 with arms 4 that can project through the hollow core of a coil 6 to support the coil. Successive operations of the packaging process are performed at a number of operating stations 80, 16, 28, 26 , at least one of which is so placed that its packaging operation is performed while a coil is so supported. The packaging may comprise an outer sheet metal wrapping applied by rotation of a wrapping arm about the coil to carry the wrapping sheet around the coil circumference 22,24 . A feed table 20 is provided to align the metal wrapping sheet initially with the coil. Two overlap ping wrapping sheets making up a wrapping for a wider coil can be secured together by a welding arm that operates on the sheets as they are wrapped around the coil.
