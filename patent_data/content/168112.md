## Description
ALPHA L ASPARTYL D PHENYLGLYC I NE ESTERS AND AMIDES USEFUL AS HIGH INTENSITY SWEETENERS John M. Janusz TECHNICAL FIELD The present application relates to alpha L aspartyl D phenylglycine esters and amides useful as high intensity sweeteners. Sweeteners are used in a variety of orally ingested products. For example, sweeteners are an important component of cakes, cookies, chewing gum, dentifrices and the like. Sweeteners are a particularly important ingredient In beverages. In terms of volume, carbonated beverages use more sweeteners than any other sweetened product category. The most widely used sweetener for food, and especially beverage products. is sucrose. Sucrose is safe, naturally occurring, and has a high sweetness quality in terms of a pure, quick onset of sweetness with no aftertaste or undertaste. However, the normal usage of sucrose provides significant caloric load which is undesirable for those persons on weight control or reduction programs. Also, those persons who have diabetes must carefully control their intake of sucrose to avoid problems associated with the disease. Sucrose Is also cariogenic so that it cannot be used in dentifrices and is undesirable in chewing gums.Additionally, and perhaps little realized, for the amount of sweetness delivered, sucrose can be expensive relative to other sweeteners such as saccharin, especially when used in carbonated beverages. The drawbacks of sucrose, including its expense, have led those in the beverage industry to seek substitute sweeteners.One particularly important quality sought in such sweeteners is high sweetness intensity. Sweetness Intensity can affect not only the safety profile and caloric value of the sweetener, but also its cost In terms of sucrose equivalent sweetness. However, the inability to predict that a given compound is sweet, and particularly that it has high sweetness intensity, makes the search for suitable substitute sweeteners a hit or miss proposition. Such unpredictability is especially true for the currently popular L aspartic acid derived sweeteners represented by the following formula EMI2.1 where X is O ester or NH amide . Various theories have been proposed for what imparts sweetness to these particular molecules. However, the current belief is that groups R1 and R2 need to be dissimilar in size for greatest sweetness intensity, I.e.one group large or bulky, the other group small. See Goodman et al., Peptide Sweeteners A Model for Peptide and Taste Preceptor lnteractions, Proc. 15th Eur. Pep. Symp., 197at , pp.271 78 Sukehlro et al., Studies on Structure Taste Relationships of Aspartyl Peptide Sweeteners Syntheses and Properties ofL Aspartyl D Alanine Amides, Science of Human Life, Vol. 11, 1977 , pp. 9 16. It also appears that when R is the large or bulky group, the stereochemical configuration generally needs to be L, L for sweetness. See U.S. Patent 3,972,860 to Moriarty et al., issued August 3, 1976 L aspartyl L phenylglycine lower alkyl esters are sweet U.S. Patent 3,492,131 to Schlatter, issued January 27, 1970 L aspartyl L phenylalanine lower alkyl esters are sweet . Conversely, when R1 is the small group, the stereochemical configuration generally needs to be L, D for sweetness. See U.S.Patent 4,411,925 to Brennan et al., issuedOctober 25, 1983 L aspartyl D alanine amides are sweet Ariyoshi et al., The Structure Taste Relationships of the Dipeptide Esters Composed of L Aspartic Acid and Beta Hydroxyamino Acids,1 Bull. Chem. Soc. Jap., Vol. 47, 1974 , pp. 326 30 L aspartyl D serlne esters are sweet . Even with these guidelines, the sweetness intensity of these L aspartic acid derived sweeteners can vary greatly depending upon which combination ofR1 and Rz groups are selected. Compare U.S. Patent 4,411,925, supra X is NH, R1 is methyl group, R2 is 2,6 dimethyl cyclohexyl group, sweetness intensity is 600 times that of sucrose , with U.S.Patent 3,907,766 to Fujino et al., issuedSeptember 23, 1975 X Is 0, R1 is methyl ester group, R2 is fenchyl group, sweetness intensity is 22,200 33,200 times that of sucrose . For beverage use, the substitute sweetener must be sufficiently soluble and hydrolytically stable. Most carbonated beverages have a pH of from about 2.5 to about 4.8. Useful sweeteners in such beverages must therefore be relatively resistant to acid catalyzed breakdown. Otherwise, the beverage can quickly lose its sweetness or possibly have undesirable off flavors imparted to it. As in the case of sweetness intensity, it can be dlfficult to predict whether a given sweetener will be hydrolytically stable, especially in an acidic environment. Other factors are also important in providing a useful substitute sweetener. To obtain approval for food or beverage use, the substitute sweetener must be safe in terms of acute toxicity as well as long term effects from continued use. The substitute sweetener should also desirably approach sucrose in terms of sweetness quality, as well as have a relatively quick onset and short duration of sweetness. Finally, to be classified as a noncaloric sweetener, the substitute sweetener or metabolic products thereof should provide minimal or no caloric value at normal usage levels. The most widely used substitute sweetener at present is saccharin, in particular its sodium salt. Saccharin has a relatively high sweetness intensity about 300 times that of sucrose and is relatively Inexpensive in providing sucrose equivalent sweetness in carbonated beverages. However, saccharin also provides an undesirable lingering bitter aftertaste. Besides saccharin, a number of the L aspartic acid derived amides have been proposed as suitable substitute sweeteners.The most prominent examples are the alpha L aspartyl L phenyl alanine lower alkyl esters, in particular the methyl ester known as aspartame. Aspartame has been approved for use in dry foods and beverages, and has recently been approved for use in aqueous beverage systems such as carbonated beverages. The sweetness intensity of aspartame is about 150 200 times that of sucrose wlth a sweetness quality approaching that of sucrose.The caloric value of aspartame is also relatively minimal at normal usage levels. However, aspartame is hydrolytically unstable in most carbonated beverages. Perhaps more important to the beverage industry, aspartame Is extremely expensive in terms of sucrose equivalent sweetness delivered. The search therefore continues for substitute sweeteners which are 1 Inexpensive in terms of sucrose equivalent sweetness 2 are hydrolytically stable in carbonated beverage systems 3 are safe 4 have satisfactory taste quality and 5 provide minimal caloric value.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to certain alpha L aspartyl Dphenylglycine esters and amides useful as sweeteners. These esters and amides include the non toxic salts and have the formula EMI7.2 wherein the ester or amide is the L,D stereochemical isomer wherein X1 is O or NH wherein R is a phenyl group having the formula EMI7.3 wherein A, B, C, D and E are H, OH, F, Cl, Br, or C1 C4 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkoxy and wherein R Is selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbyl radicals having formulas a b c d e f and g EMI8.1 EMI9.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 R5.R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12 and R13 are H, or C1 C4 alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or alkoxy X2 isCH2, O, S, SO, S02, C O, CR140H, NR14EMI9.2 wherein R14 is H or C1 C2 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl provided that when R is a hydrocarbyl radical of formula e , f or 9 , R10, R11, R12 and R13 are each H when XZ is other thanCH2 or O m is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 n Is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 p and q are 0, 1, 2 or 3 and the sum of p q is not greater than 3 x is 1, 2 or 3 y and z are 0, 1 or 2 and the sum of y z is not greater than 2. These alpha L aspartyl D phenyl D phenylglycine esters and amides are more hydrolytically stable in carbonated beverages than aspartame. Also, certain of these esters and amides have sufficiently high sweetness Intensity so as to be relatively inexpensive in terms of sucrose equivalent sweetness. Based on available data for the expected metabolites, it is believed that these esters and amides are safe for use in food and beverage systems, and will provide minimal caloric value at normal usage levels. the taste quality of these sweeteners Is satisfactory. The onset and duration of sweetness for some of these esters or amides can be somewhat slower and more lingering than that of sucrose. Accordingly, mixtures of these esters or amides with other sweeteners having a quicker onset of sweetness are sometimes preferred. A. Alpha L aspartyl D phenylglyclne esters and amides The esters and amides of the present invention have the formula EMI10.1 It has been determined that the L,D stereochemical isomer imparts the sweetness character to these esters and amides. However, minor amounts of the D,L, L,L and D,D stereochemical isomers can be tolerated without adversely affecting the taste quality ofL,D stereochemical isomer. Such diastereomeric mixtures typically comprise at least about 50 of the L,D stereochemical isomer, preferably at least about 70 of the L,D isomer, and most preferably at least about 95 of the L,D isomer. The esters or amides of the present invention can be In the form of non toxic salts. As used herein, non toxic salts means salts of the present esters and amides which are physiologically acceptable for ingestion. Such salts include both cationic and acid additlon salts of these esters and amides. By cationic salts is meant those salts formed by neutralization of the free carboxylic acid group of the instant esters and amides by bases of physiologically acceptable metals, ammonia and amines. Examples of such metals are sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Examples of such amines are n methyl glucamine and ethanolamine. By acid addition salts is meant those salts formed between the free amino group of the instant esters and amides and a physiologically acceptable acid.Examples of such acids are acetic, benzoic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, citric, fumaric, gluconic, lactic, maleic, malic, sulfuric, sulfonic, nitric, phosphoric, saccharic, succinic and tartaric acids. The compounds of the present invention can be in the form of either esters or amides X1 is O or NH . The amides are desirable from the standpoint of having greater hydrolytic stabil ity than the esters. However, the esters have acceptable hydrolytic stability and in particular have a hydrolytic stability greater than that of aspartame. Also, in terms of sweetness intensity, the esters tend to have a greater sweetness intensity.

Sweetness Intensity of Alpha L Aspa rtyl D Phenylg lycine Esters and Amides The sweetness intensity of the esters and amides of the present invention relative to sucrose was determined according to the following procedure Male subjects were chosen at random from a group of about 20 persons who had previously been selected on the basis of proven tasting acuity, i.e., persons who could easily recognize the four basic tastes sweet, sour, bitter and salty and who were adept at quantifying their own physiological response numerically. The subjects were asked to taste and expectorate about 10 ml of a test sample temperature of about 220C having dissolved therein the ester or amide. The subjects were then asked to compare the sweetness of the test sample with five standard samples which contained increasing amounts of sucrose.The standard samples were letter coded A, B, C, D and E and were designated on a ballot by a closed linear scale. Sweetness intensity of the test sample was recorded by the subject making a mark on the linear scale at a point he considered equal In sweetness among the standard samples interpolation between standards was encouraged. After completion of the panel, a five point numeric scale was superimposed on the linear scales to obtain numerical data data were averaged and recorded to the nearest 0.25 unit. Equivalent sucrose sweetness was determined by referring to graphs of w v sucrose concentratlon in the standard samples versus a linear numeric scale. Sweetness intensity was calculated by dividing the concentration w v of perceived sweeteness by the concentration wiz of the ester or amide required to produce that sweetness. The five point scale with standard samples ranging from 1.37 0.040M to 71.978 0.35 M sucrose was used for sweetness intensity testing. The test sample was prepared at a concentration which would be equal to about 8 10 sucrose.

Uses of alpha L aspartyl D phenylglycine esters and amides The esters or amides of the present invention can be used to sweeten a variety of edible materials. However, the onset and duration of the sweetness of some of these esters and amides is somewhat slower and more lingering than that of sucrose. As a result, mixtures of these esters or amides with other sweeteners having a quicker onset of sweetness are preferred. In particular, mixtures of these esters or amides with saccharin or nontoxic salts thereof are especially preferred. As used herein, non toxic salts of saccharin1 means those salts of saccharin with physiologically acceptable cations such as sodium, potassium, calcium or ammonium.The mixtures of the present esters or amides with saccharin can be in a ratio sweetness equivalent basis of from about 2 1 to about 1 9, and preferably from about 1 1 to about 1 4. Mixtures of the present esters and amides with other sweeteners having a quicker onset of sweetness can also be used. Examples of such sweeteners include Acesulfam the L aspartyl L phenylalanine lower alkyl esters disclosed in U.S.Patent 3,492,131 to Schlatter, issued January 27, 1970 herein incorporated by reference , in particular the methyl ester known as aspa rtame the alpha L aspartyl L 1 hydroxymethylalkyl amides disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,338,346 to Brand, issued July 6, 1982 herein incorporated by reference the alpha L aspartyl L 1 hydroxyethylalkyl amides disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,423,029 to Rizzi, issued December 27, 1983 herein incorporated by reference the alpha L aspartyl D alanlne amides disclosed in U.S.Patent 4,411,925 to Brennan et al., issued October 25, 1983 herein incorporated by reference and the alpha L aspartylD serlne amides disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,399,263 to Brennan et al., Issued August 16, 1983 herein incorporated by reference .Low calorie mixtures can also be formulated which contain esters or amides of the present Invention with sucrose. The esters and amides of the present invention, Including mixtures thereof with other sweeteners, are useful for sweetening a variety of food products, such as fruits, vegetables, Juices, cereals, meat products such as ham or bacon, sweetened milk products, egg products, salad dressings, ice creams and sherbets, gelatins, icings, syrups, cake mixes and frostings. In particular, these sweeteners are useful for sweetening a variety of beverages such as lemonade, coffee, tea, and particularly carbonated beverages.The sweeteners of the present invention can also be used to sweeten dentifrices, mouthwashes, and chewing gums, as well as drugs such as liquid cough and cold rem edits. As an alternative to direct addition of the esters and amides of the present invention to the foregoing edible materials, sweetener concentrates can be prepared using these esters and amides in, for example, granular or liquid form. These concentrates can then be conventionally metered into foods, beverages and the like as desired by the user. The esters and amides of the present invention are stable substances that can be used in a variety of physical forms such as powders, granules, tablets, syrups, pastes, solutions and the like. Liquid or solid ingestible carriers such as water, glycerol, starch, sorbitol, salts, citric acid, cellulose and other suitable non toxic substances can also be used. These sweetening agents can be readily used in pharmaceutical compositions to impart a sweet taste. The ester and amide sweeteners of the present invention are used in amounts sufficient to provide a sweet taste of the desiredIntensity for orally ingested products. The amount of the sweet ener added will generally depend upon commercial needs as well as individual sweetness sensitivities.Specific Embodiments of Oral Products Containing Alpha L Aspartyl D Phenylglycine Esters A.
