## Description
This invention relates to the treatment of aqueous systems, especially cooling water systems, and to the composition used herein. In industrial cooling water systems, for instance in industrial cooling towers, the water used is not, of course, sterile with the result that bacteria accumulate in the system and this quite commonly gives rise to a slimy deposit on the surfaces of the system which come into direct contact with the cooling water. This has essentially two adverse effects. First, if the slime is allowed to accumulate it tends to clog up the equipment and make it less efficient. Second, the slime harbours bacteria, in particular anaerobic bacteria which, underneath the slime, can cause corrosion of the metal surface. A variety of different microbiological control agents have been used to inhibit slime formation and while some of these are effective in preventing the accumulation of slime they are not able to prevent the formation of slime altogether. In consequence, therefore, it is not possible to prevent corrosion occurring. The present invention resides in the discovery that specific combinations of two types of biocide give rise to synergistic effects such that the extent to which the bacteria are killed exceeds that which one would expect from using the sum of the individual components of the compositions. GB A 2145708 discloses a biocidal composition based on a phosphorous compound having a hydroxy alkyl group directly attached to the phosphous atom such compounds are obtained by reacting phosphine with an aldehyde usually formaldehyde or a ketone such that the product may contain up to 10 by weight of free aldehyde or ketone. GB A 2138799 discloses a method of treating an aqueous system with a biocide, for example an alkyl phosphonium compound or a straight chain aliphatic aldehyde such as glutaraldehyde, and an ethoxylated phenol. According to the present invention there is provided a method of treating an aqueous system which comes into contact with a metal which comprises applying thereto a phosphonium compound of the formula wherein each R, which may be the same or different, is a C₁ C₆ alkyl group which is optionally substituted by, say, a hydroxy, aryl or cyano group, or a phenyl group which is optionally substituted by one or more C₁ C₄ alkyl groups, R₁ is a C₈ C₁₈ alkyl group, X is chlorine or bromine, and a straight chain aliphatic di aldehyde, the phosphonium compound and aldehyde being present in a weight ratio of 10 1 to 1 10. It is believed that the phosphonium compounds are broad spectrum biocides which are also particularly effective at cleaning surfaces from slime and microbiological debris while the aldehydes are effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. With the phosphonium compounds it is particularly preferred that R represents n butyl, R₁ represents tetra decyl and X is chlorine. A commercially available phosphonium compound is Belclene registered trade mark 350 available from Ciba Geigy. This is a 50 active aqueous solution. Suitable straight chain aliphatic di aldehydes generally possess 2 to 6 carbon atoms, especially saturated dialdehydes having 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as glutaraldehyde which is particularly preferred. This is available as a 50 active solution as Ucarcide registered trade mark from Union Carbide and as Sepacid 50 registered trade mark from BASF. While the two types of biocide can be added separately to the system, it will generally be more convenient to add them together in the form of a composition. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a composition suitable for addition to an aqueous system which comes into contact with a metal which comprises a phosphonium compound of the specified formula together with a straight chain aliphatic aldehyde. In general, the composition will be added to the system in an amount up to 500 mg per litre active and especially to 50 mg per litre. Typically, the concentration of the aldehyde will be greater than that of the phosphonium compound, the amounts of aldehyde being typically up to 300 mg per litre and preferably from 1 to 20 mg per litre while the amount of phosphonium compound added is typically up to 200 mg per litre, preferably from 1 to 20 mg per litre. The weight ratio of the two types of bactericide is from 10 1 to 1 10, especially from 3 1 to 1 3. A very cost effective formulation can be provided with a weight ratio of about 1 1. It will, of course, be appreciated that other ingredients can be present in the composition, notably dispersants, especially dispersants which have biological activity, in particular ethoxylated phenols having the general formula wherein m represents 2 40 and R represents C In a typical formulation, there will be 5 20 by weight of each of the two biocides and 2 10 by weight of dispersant and especially about 10 by weight of each of the biocides and about 5 by weight of the dispersant, with the remainder, in all cases, being water. It has been found that the use of such a combination of biocides is effective to keep the surfaces of the aqueous system free of slimy deposits and to prevent corrosion caused by, in general, sulphate reducing bacteria which can form under the slimy deposits, while, at the same time, being synergistic. A further surprising finding is that this combination is effective against The use of the two biocides is thus particularly effective at maintaining clean and corrosion free conditions in water treatment plant such as industrial cooling water systems as well as in, say, air conditioning plant and plant for water sprinklers. The following Examples further illustrate the present invention. After these contact times samples were taken and incubated on nutrient agar for 3 days at 22 C and surviving bacteria counted. For each contact time and ratio of biocides studied, graphs were constructed of percent bacteria killed as a function of biocide concentration. The concentration of biocide necessary to give a 90 kill was then read from the graph and is tabulated below. These examples demonstrate that the alkyl phosphonium chloride and glutaraldehyde are synergistic at least in the ratio of 3 1 to 1 3. Three laboratory experimental recirculating cooling systems were innoculated with The effectiveness of the glutaraldehyde component against anaerobic bacteria was demonstrated by exposing water known to contain sulphate reducing bacteria to glutaraldehyde. This exposure was for 24 hours at 30 C, whereupon 1 ml samples of water were transferred to tubes containing culture medium which was specific for sulphate reducing bacteria. The medium was then incubated at 30 C and the number of days noted for positive indications of sulphate reducing bacteria i.e. formulation of iron sulphide leading to blackening of the medium . The results obtained were This confirms glutaraldehyde as being effective against anaerobic bacteria. These examples thus illustrate that the biocide combination both This example illustrates the effectiveness of the biocide combination against The results obtained were This example illustrates the biocide combination to be effective against
