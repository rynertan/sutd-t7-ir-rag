## Description
AN IMPROVED ELECTRO ACOUSTIC TRANSDUCER ELEMENTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improved electro acoustic transducer element, and more particularly relates to improvement in construction of an electro acoustic element incorporating a polymer piezoelectric film, which is used fer transmission and or conversion of ultrasonie As a substitute for the conventional inorganic piezos ectric material, polymer piezoelectric material is ventameously used for ultrasonic vibrators in the fi.led of diagnosties and detection of internal defects in various articles for its easy production of large sized films, eaeiness in treatment and fine fit to curved surfaces. The aco stic impendance of the polymer piezolectric material is by far lower than that of the inorganic , piezoelectric material and very close to those of water, organism and general organie materials. Thus, the polymer piezoelectric material functions as an excellent transmitter and receiver for ultrasonic waves which travel through these objects. In connection math this, however, use of the polymer piezoelectric film in the construction of an ultrasonic transducer is in practice aqccompanied viith various problems. In the case of ultrasonic devices used for diagnostics and or detection of internal defects, ultrasonic waves are mostly used with frequencies in the range from 1 to 10 KHz. It is well knovrn that, in order to obtain high transmission efficiency, the resonant frequency of the vibrator has to match the frequency of the ultrasonic wave to be used for the process. In other words, the thickness of the piezoelectric film has to be chosen in accordance with the frequency of the ultrasonic wave to be used for the aimed process. In the case of polyvinylidene fluoride which is a typical polymer piezoelectric material, its frequency constant foto is equal to 115 L izcin, fO being the resonant frequency of a free thickness vibrator and to. being the thickness of the film. In order to obtain high efficiency in transmission of the ultrasonic wave of 2.5 MHz frequency which is commonly used for diagnostic purposes, it is required for the film to have a thickness of 460ism m for a half wave drive, and 230 m for a quarter wave drive. A potential of about 106 V cm is needed for polarization of polymer for provision of piezoelectricity.Polarization of a polymer film of a large thickness is often accompanied with troubles suc as aerial discharge, thereby disabling easy preparation of a thick polymer piezoelectric film. The available thickness under the present condition is 100S m or smaller. This is the first disadvantage of the conventional art. In production of a polymeric piezoelectric film, it is very difficult to optimumly control the process in order to provide the resultant film with a thickness well suited for transmission of the ultrasonic wave of an aimed frequency.Such a polymer piezoelectric film is in nost cases obtained by polarization of a material film after drawing. Depending on the process conditions in drawing and heat treatment, thickness of the resultant film varies greatly. Quite unlike the inorganic piezoelictric material, it is extremely troublesome and, consequently, almost infeasible to adJust the thickness of a polymer piezoelectric film by mean of mechanical cutting. This is the second disadvantage of the conventional art. Dielectric constant of a polymer piezoelectric film is in general not so high as that of the inorganic piezoelectric material such as PZT. Therefore, increase in thickness of the film causes reduction in electric capacity. As a result, increased electric impedance of the vibrator does not well match that of the electric power source, thereby blocking smooth supply of energy to the vibrator from the electric power source. his is the third disadvantage of the prior art.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is the basic object of the present invention to provide an electro acoustic transducer element incorporating a polymer piezoelectric film of a reduced thickness which enables transmission of ultrasonic waves having frequencies lower than its inherent resonant frequency vith reduced transmissian loss. It is another object of the present invention to provide an electro acoustic transducer element incorporating a polymer piezoelectric fila of an ideal function without any noticeable damage on high flexibility, lo acoustic impendance characteristics and easiness in treatment inherent to the polymer Diezoelectric material. In accordance with the basic aspect of the present invention, a polymer piezoelectric film is accompanied, at least on its one surface side, with an additional payer whose acoustic i.m pedance Z is equal or very close to the acoustic impendance 30 of the polymer piezoelectrid film. In accordance with pre erred embodiment of the present invention, a polymer piezoelectric film is accompanied, on its acoustic emanation side, with an additional layer whose acoustic impedance z is equal or very close to the acoustic impendance ZO of the polymer piezoelectric film. In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a polymer piezoelectric film is accompanied, on the side opposite to its acoustic emanation side, with an additional layer whose acoustic impedance Z is equal or very close to the acoustic impédance z0 of the polymer piezoelectric film. In accordance with the other referred embodiment of the present invention, a polymer piezoelectric film is ccom panid, on its both surface sides, with respective additional layers those acoustic impedances are equal or very close to the acoustic impedance ZO of the polymer piezoelectric film. The additional layer may be either directly or indirectly disposed to the polymer niezoelectric film. Any polymer film having piezoelectricity in the thickness direction as a result of polarization is usable for the present invention. Such a film is made of a polymeric material such as polyvinylidene fluoride, copolymers of polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl chloride, acrylons titrile polymers or ferroelectric ceramic including lead zirconate titanate powder. The ter acoustic emanation side refers to one of the to surface sides of a polymer piezoelectric film which faces an acoustic transmission medium through which the ultr sonic waves of an aimed frequency travel assay from or towards the polymer piezoelectric film. In the following description, this side of the film may be referred to the front side whereas the other side of the film opposite to this acoustic emanation side may be referred to the rear side . In accordance with the present invention, a polymer piezoelectric film is either directly or indirectly accompanied, on either of its front and rear sides, vath an additional layer. That is, the additional layer may be placed either in a direct surface contact with the piezo .electric film or in an indirect surface association with the piezoelectric film via any intervening layer such as an electrode. The additional layer may hereinafter referred to the front additional layer or the rear additional layer . Presence of such an additional layer on either side of the piezoelectric film is essential to the purposes of the present invention, and the additional layer should be made of a material whose acoustic impedance Z is equal or very close to the acoustic impendance ZO of the piezoelectric film. Preferably, the ratio Z Zo should be in a range from 0.2 to 2 exclusive. More preferably, the ratio Z ZO should be in a range from 0.3 to 2 exclusively. Further prefera bly, the ratio Z ZO should be in a range from 0.5 to 2 exclusive. When water is used for the acoustic transmission medium, it is preferable that the ratio Z Zf should be 0.5 or larger, Zf being the acoustic impendance of water. Pur ther, a relationship Zf Z Zo should preferably exist among the acoustic impedances of tauter, the additional layer and the piezoelectric film. Such an additional layer is preferably made of a polymeric material such as polyethylene telephthalate, polycarbonate, PMMA, polystylene, A3S, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamide, aromatic polyamide, polyvinylidene fluoride or a mixture of such a polymeric material with an inorganic compound. When any shape retainability is required for the additional layer, carbon fibers may be mixed to such a polymeric material. The additional layer matey be given in the form of a film which is a mixture of such a polymeric material with thin metallic fibers such as stainless fibers v hose diameter is by far smaller than the wave lengths of sonic waves. When flexibility should be accentuated in the assembled state of the additional layer with the polymer piezoelectric film, a nylon, rubber, polyurethane or siliconerubber sheet is usable for the additional layer. In order to assemble the polymer piezoelectric film with the additional layer in an acoustically integral fashion, the material for the additional is first shaped into a film which is next bonded to the polymer piezoelectric film. It is also employable to coat one surface of the.polymer piezoelectric film with the material for the additional layer. In the latter case, dichlorobenzene solution of RSWA of chlorobenzene solution of polyethylene telephthalate is preferably used for the solvent, which may be removed by evaporation after coating. The coating may be subjected to appropriate polymerization such as vapor phase polymerization. BRIEF DESORIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS.

frequency i , and that a current Is flows between electrodes vath an electric voltage V, the folloviing matrix is theoretically established between these values.EMI17.1 whereEMI17.2 For a non piezoelectric body, h is equal to zero in the equation 1 . The general construction of an electro acoustic transducer is shorn in Fig. 1, in which the transducer includes, on the front side of a piezoelectric film 0, front non piezoelectric layers 1, 2, n including a front electrode e and an acoustic transimission medium f such as water or organism. The transducer further includes, on the rear side of the piezoelectric film 0, non piezoelectric layers 1 , 2 , m , These rear side non piezoelectric layers may include a bonding layer or layer a rear electrode e , a protector film, a substrate, a reflector plate and the additional layer in accordance with the present invention.The real thicknesses and weights of the electrodes e and e disregarded in the following consideration. An equivalent circuit for driving the system shown inFig. 1 can be designed on the assumption that loads and displacements are continuous at each boundary between adjacent layers and the real electricacharge within the piezoelectric film is equal to naught. The equivalent circuit so designed is shoter in Sig. 2.

The two port nextwork shown in Fig. 3 is used fbr connecting the equivalent circuit in wig. 2 to an electric goner source having an internal impedance Z,, the electric impedance of the transducer with respect to the power source being designated with ZL. The mode of distribution and consumption of the energy supplied by the electric power source is sEsematically shown in Fig. 4, in which Pr is the reflection energy caused by inconsistency between ZS and Zin, Pu is the input energy to the transducer and given in the form of the difference between Po and Pr, PAf is the front acoustic emanation, PAb is the rear acoustic emanation energy and Pth is the internal consumption energy heat within the transducer,.

Hence, the following equations are conducted.EMI20.1 On the basis of these equations, the losses are defined as follows Electric reflection loss ML 10 log Pr Po Electro acoustic conversion loss front side TIf 10 log PAf PT 5 Electro acoustic conversion loss rear side TLf 10 log PAb PT Internal loss IL 10 long Pth PT Non tuning conversion loss CLf 10 log PAt Po front side ML TLf on tuning conversion loss CLb 10 log PAb Po rear side tTh L TIib These definitions clearly indicates that TLf should be designed as still 1 as possible and TLb as large as possible over a wide frequency band, in order to enhance utility of a transducer used for non destructive ultrasonic detection. Following measurement systems were employed in evaluation of the function of the electro acoustic transducer element in accordance with the present invention. Keasure.ments of the non tuning conversion loss front side GLf, the electro acoustic conversion loss TLf and the electric reflection of the produced transducer were carried out in the following fashion. An arrangement used for measurement of the non tuning conversion loss is shown in Fig. 5. In the measurement, a transducer including a PVDF piezoelectric film was used in a water bath in which a bronze block was placed as reflector.The transducer was connected to a kno .rn high frequency pulse oscillator having an impedance of 50Q The generated ultrasonic pulses ere emanated into the water bath and those reflected by the bronze block 7ere received by the same transducer. The received signals were indicated an a CRT synchroscope for visual observation after appropriate anplification and detection.Concurrently with this procedure, the exciting electric signals voltage were passed to the synchroscope for visual observation after appropriate attenuation, emplification and detection. The rate of attenuation v.as adjusted so that both indications on the synchroscope should meet. This procedure .as repeated for various frequencies of the ultrasonic pulses. When the rate of attenuation is equal to Imes, the non tuning conversion loss front side CLf is given by the following equation Lmes Lref Lw 6 2 6 where LreL Reflection loss of the bronze block LW Loss caused by adsorption and dispersion of the ultrasonic waves in the water bath. 6d3 Loss caused by the parallel connection of impedances at transmission and reception, characteristic to the pulse echo method. Under the conditions employed in the later described exemples of the present invention, the value of Lref L.j is almost equal to 1 dB. For measurement of the electric reflection loss ML, the transducer was placed thin a water bath in which reflection of ultrasonic saves was negligible. The impedance of the transducer was measured by an arrangement shorn in Fig. 6 in terns of the reflection voltage and its phases For this measurement, the transducer included a polyvinylidene fluoride film obtained by applying polarization for 1 hour at 10 v cm and 1200C to an uniaxially dravai material film. For theoretical evaluation of the transducer element in accordance with the present invention, the following characteristic values were used for the materials used for the measurements.

The transducer element 10 shovm in Fig. 7B includes a polymer piezoelectric layer 11, a rear side electrode lAb, an additional layer 12 fixed directly to the front side surface of the film 11, and a front side electrode 14a fixed to the front side surface of the additional layer 12. The transducer elenent 10 shovm in Fig. 7C includes a polymer piezoelectric film 11, a front side electrode 14a, an additional layer 12a coupled to the front side of the film 11 via the front side electrode 14a, a rear side electrode 14b, and another additional layer 12b coupled to the film 11 via the rear side electrode 14b.

Fig. 8 deicts a r actic1 electro acoustic transducer 20 in which one embodiment of the transducer element in accordance vjith the present invention. The transducer 20 includes a circular column shaped substrate 23, a rear side electrode 24b operating as a reflector plate also and disposed to the front face of the substrate 23, a cylindrical spacer 25 surrounding the rear side electrode 24b and made of a bond or the like, a polymer piezoelectric film 21 coupled to the front side surface of the rear side electrode 24b, a front side electrode 24a coupled to the front side surface of the film 11, an additional layer 22 made of polyvinylidene fluoride or the like and coupled to the front side surface of the front side electrode 24a, an annular electrically conductive wafer 26 surrounding the additional layer 22 and in contact with the front side surface of the front side electrode 24a, and an annular bond layer 27 covering the periphery of the additional layer 22 and the front surface of the conductive wafer 26.

The reflector plate, i.e. the rear side electrode 24b is made of a material whose acoustic impedance is by far larder than those of the polymer piezoelectric film 21 and the substrate 23. Metals such as Au, Cu and W are in general advantageously usable for this purpose. sEhen the rear side electrode 24b is formed on the rear side surface of the polymer piezoelectric film in advance to formation of the transducer 20, an insulating material such as a ZT ceramic plate may be added as a reflector plate. Although the transducer 20 shown in Fig. 8 incorporates the transducer element 10 shove in Fig. 7A, different type of transducer element 10 shown in either of Figs. 7B through 7F if usable for a similar purpose. Still further embodiments of the electro acoustic transducer element in accordance with the present invention are shove in Figs. 23A through 23E. The transducer element 30 shove in Xig. 23A includes a polymer piezoelectric film 31, a front side electrode 34a fixed to the front side surface of the film 31, and an additional layer 32 coupled to the rear side surface of the film 31 via a rear side electrode 34b. The transducer element 30 shoxrm in Fig. 23B includes a polymer piezoelectric film 31, a front side electrode 34a fixed to the front side surface of the film 31, and rear side electrode 34b coupled to the rear side surface of the film 31 via an additional layer 32. The transducer element 30 shown in Fig. 23C includes a polymer piezoelectric film 31,. a front side electrode 34a fixed to the front side surface of the film 31, an additional layer 32 coupled to the rear side surface of the film 31 via a rear side electrode 34b, and an acoustic reflector plate 35 fixed to the rear side surface of the additional layer 32.

EXAIPLES Example 1 and comparative example 1. A Fig. 7type transducer element 10 shown in Fig. gA was used in the measurement. The polymer piezoelectric film 11 was made of polyvinylidene fluoride and 30 g m in thickness and 0.92 cm2 in surface area. water was used as the acoustic transmission medium ATtj. Fouz types of test pieces were prepared. The first to third test pieces I to IV included polyvinylidene fluoride, either piezoelectric or non piezoelectric, additional layers, one for each, of 7.5,15, 30 and 60 m thicknes respectively.The fourth test piece IV included no additional layer.Non tuning conversion loss CLf L TLf was measured for ultrasonic waves of various frequencies and the results are graphically shown in Fig. 9B. For a comparative example, a transducer element shown in Fig. 10A was prepared, which included a polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric film 11, front and rear side electrodes 14a and 14b, and a copper plate 15 of 66.5 8 m thickness fixed to the front side surface of the front side electrode 14a. later was used for the acoustic transmission medium ATM. The piezoelectric film 11 was common in dimension to that used for the transducer element shown in Fig. 9A. The resultant relationship between the non tuning conversion loss and the frequency of the ultrasonic wave applied to the transducer element is shown in Fig. lOB, in which the solid line curve is for a film without mechanical and dielectric losses 0, 0 , and the dot line curve is for a film with mechanical and dielectric losses 0.1, 0.25 . This outcome clearly indicates that, for the transducer element of this comparative exle, the loss presents minimal peaks at frequencies fo 2, fo and 3fo 2 but upsurges at other frequencies. That is, the transducer element of this type has narrow frequency band filtering characteristics. In the evaluation of the relationship, the mechanical loss of the copper plate was disregarded. When the result in Fig. 9B present invention is compared with that in Fig. 10B comparative example , the characteristic curve for the present invention extends over wider frequency band and no remarkable rise in the loss is noted. It is further learned from the results shown in Fig. 9B that increased thickness of the front side additional layer results in a loner resonant frequency, i.e. a frequency corresponding to the minimum value of the loss TLf.Consequently, resonant frequency of the transducer element in accordance with the present invention can be adjusted quite freely by means of appropriately changing the thickness of the front side additional layer 12 without any change in the thickness of the polymer piezoelectric film 11.This successfully precludes the above described disadvs tages inherent to the prior art. Further, in the construction of the transducer element used for the present example see Fig. 9A , the additional layer 12 is coupled to the front side surface of the piezoelectric film 11 via the front side electrode 14a, the latter is protected against any external attack, thereby assuring long life of the transducer element and blocking dangerous electric leakage outside the system.Example 2 A different type of electro acoustic transducer 40 in accordance with the present invention is shown in Fig. 11.Here, a Fig. 79 type transducer element is used. The transducer 40 includes a metallic housing 45 having a bottom opening, a polymer piezoelectric film 41 placed in the housing 45 whilst closing the bottom opening, and a pair of electrodes 44a and 44b placed in contact vith both side surfaces of the film 41. In contact with the front side electrode44a, a front side additional layer 42a is filled into the bottom opening and fixed to the housing 45 via an annular bond layer 47a. A rear side additional layer 42b is located on the rear side electrode 44b and surrounded by an annular metallic ring 46.The members 42b and 46 are fixed to the housing 45 via a borc layer 47b. A lead 48 extends outsides from. the metallic ring 46 and the metallic housing.45 is earthed. water is used for the acoustic transmission medium A ., which the front side additional layer 42a contacts. A polyvinylidene fluoride film of 76 m thinness and 4.4 cm2 surface area was used for the piezoelectric film 41, polyester films of 25 and 53 M m thickness tf were used for front side additional layer 42a, and polyester films of 25 and 50 g m thickness tb were used for the rear side additional layer 42b. A further transducer of like construction but lvithout the rear side additional layer as prepared as a comparative example. Particulars of the test pieces are as follows.

Example 3. A further different type of electro acoustic transducer 50 in accordance with the present invention is shown inFig. 13. Here, a Fig. 7A type transducer element is used.The transducer 50 includes a hollow metallic housing 55, a cylinder 56 screwed to the bottom of the housing 55, and a polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric film 51 placed .ivithin the housing 55 whilst closing the end opening of the cylinder 56. The film 51 is backed by a PMMA substrate 53 via a rear side reflector plate 54b made of strainless steel. Here, the reflector plate 34b acts as a rear side electrode also, and 100 g m in thickness and 21.0 mm in diamter. In the end opening of the cylinder 56, a front side additional layer 52 is coupled to the front side surface of the film 51 via a front side electrode 54a.A lead 58 extends outs .ards from the reflector plate 54b, i.e. the rear side electrode, and the metallic housing 55 is earthed. The transducer 50 of the above described construction was placed within a water bath for transmission of high frequency pulses of several s periods and the ultrasonic waves reflected by a brass block immensed in the water bath were received by the same transducer. The resultant actual frequency characteristics of its electro acoustic conversion loss TLf are shorn in Fig. 14 vath nominal frequency characteristics theoretically estimated on the basis of the above described equations 1 through 5 . In the illustration, the solid line curve is for the actual frequency characteristics and the dot line curve for the nominal frequency characteristics. It is clear xrom the illustration that the actual and nominal loss values roughly meet with difference of 2 to 3 dB, and differences in loss peak value are 0.5 11Hz or smaller. Sufficient coincidence between the loss values is recognized. For comnarison, like frequency characteristics are sho jn in Sig. 15 for a comparative transducer without provision of the front side additional layer 52. The solid line curve is for the actual values and the dot line curve for the estimated nominal values. Appreciable coincidence is recognized to exist between both values in this case also.The difference in frequency characteristics between Figs. 14 and 15 is resulted from provision of the front side additional layer. By adding the additional of 25 m thickness, the resonant frequency for the minimum peak loss value is lowered from about 10 to 8 I Ez without any substantial narrov7ing in the frequency band which the characteristic curve extends over. This enables production of an electroacoustic transducer having a relatively low consonant frequency or frequencies. even rlith use of a relatively thin polymer piezoelectric film which can be produced rather easily.In addition, the front side electrode 54a is well protected against possible external attack by presence of the additional layer on its front side. The limited thickness of the epoxy bond layer is regarded the proximate cause of the difference between the actual and estimated nominal loss values. Example 4. An electro acoustic transducer similar in basic construction as that used in the preceding example was used with some changes in demension of the elements. Additional layers made of polyethy1eflete1ephthalate were disposed to the front sides of the associated polyvinylidene fluoride films 51, respectively in accordance with the present invention. For comparison, a transducer was prepared also, which included no front side additional layer. Particulars of the test pieces were as follows EMI39.1 tb SEP thickness SEP in SEP p SEP m SEP of SEP the SEP front tb Test SEP piece SEP side SEP additional SEP layer. tb SEP I SEP 5 tb II SEP 25 tb SEP tb SEP III SEP 50 tb IV SEP O tb An uni axially dravm polyvinylidene fluoride film of 76 a m thickness .as used for the polymer piezoelectric film 51 and a copper plate of 168 a m thickness and 11.3 mm diameter was used for the rear side reflector plate 54b, i.e.the rear side electrode. In the case of the test pieces I and II 5 and 25 pm thickness , the additional layers 52.were coated with chlorophenol solution of polyethylene telephthalate. The nominal results obtained by estimation are shown in Fig. 16, in which the electro acoustic conversion loss If and noch tuning conversion loss CLf are taken on the ordinate and the frequency of the ultrasonic vave used in the measurement is taken on the abscissa. It rrns confirmed that the difference in resonant frequency between the actual and nominal estimated values was 0.5 BRz and that in loss values was 3 dB or smaller. 7 ith increase in thickness of the additional layer 52, the resonant frequency shifted towards the lower side. The relative frequency band Af fr was 0.52, 0.54, 0.57 and 0.63 for 0, 5, 25 and 50 pm thickness, respectively. That is, the relative frequency band increased with increase in thickness of the additional layer 52.Example 5. Fig. 17 depicts a still different type of transducer 60 incorporating a polymer piezoelectric transducer element in accordance with the present invention. The transducer element used in this example is basically same in type with that used in Fig. 13 except that the entire construction is concave towards the acoustic emanation side, i.e. the front side. The transducer 60 includes a polycarbonate pipe 65 of 20 mm outer diameter, a polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric film 61 of 76 m thicknss and bonded to the bottom opening of bhe pipe 65 and a pair of aluminium electrodes 64a and 64b disposed to both side surfaces of the film 61 by evaporation. The front side electrode 64a is accompanied on its front side with a thin bronze phosphate ring 66 via electrically conductive bond.An additional layer 62 made of undratn polyvinylidene film is bonded to the ring 66 in contact with the front side electrode 64a.A rearwardly converging copper substrate 63 of 13 mm maximum diameter is placed in the pipe 65 in contact with the rear side electrode 64b, which is in turn backed with an epoxy resin filler 67 in a manner such that the converging end of the substrate 63 projects rearwards. A front side lead 68a extends outsides from the front side electrode 64a through the pipe whereas a rear side lead 68b extends from the converging end of the substrate 63. The assembly is encased within a cylindlcal metallic housing 69. Five sets of different test pieces I through V were prepared as follows EMI42.1 Test SEP piece SEP Thickness SEP in SEP m SEP of SEP the SEP front tb SEP additionel SEP layer tb SEP I SEP 19 tb SEP tb SEP II SEP 38 tb tb SEP III SEP 57 tb SEP IV SEP 76 tb SEP tb V SEP 0 tb SEP Water bath was used for the acoustic transmission medium ATM. The estimated nominal frequency characteristics of the electro acoustic conversion loss TLf are shown Fig. 18. As in Example 4, the resonant frequency shifts towards the lower side with increase in thickness of the additional layer 62. Use of the additional layer enlarges the relative frequency band. Thus, the electro acoustic transducers prepared were able to generate sonic waves of frequencies well suited for diagnostic applications whilst using thin polymer piezoelectric films. A brass plate was placed in the water bath measurement of echo signals reflected by the brass block. It was confirmed that there was a good coincidence between the actual and estimated nominal values. Using the transducer incorporating the additional layer of 38S m thickness, a high frequency coil L of about 5 p H was connected in series to the transducer. The transducer so prepared was used for obtaining resolution echogram of a flsh in a water bath using an ultrasonic wave of 5MHz frequency. The resulting resolution was satisfactory for both depth and transverse direction.Example 6. A transducer shown in Fig. 19 was used for this Example and included a Fig. 7A type transducer element in accordance with the present invention. The transducer 70 includes a polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric film 71 of 76 pm thickness and accompanied with pair of aluminium electrodes 74a and 74b, an additional layer 72 coupled to the front side of the film 71 via a front side of the film 71 via a front side electrode 74a, a copper reflector plate 76 coupled to the rear side of the film 71, and a substrate 73.The additional layer 72 is made of an uniaxially dravm polyvinylidene fluoride non piezoelectric film. The thickness of the reflector plate 76 is chosen so that it operates as a quarter wave length plate in the vicinity of the resonant frequency. Five sets of test pieces I through V were prepared as follows EMI44.1 tb Thickness SEP in SEP CI SEP m SEP Thickness SEP in SEP p SEP m tb Test SEP piece SEP of SEP the SEP front SEP side SEP of SEP the SEP rear SEP side tb additional SEP layer SEP reflector SEP plate tb I SEP 19 SEP 210 tb SEP 38 SEP 245 tb slIt SEP 76 SEP 320 tb SEP IV SEP 152 SEP 500 tb tb V SEP 0 tb SEP tb The frequency characteristics of the non tuning conversion .loss are shown in Fig. 20.It is noticed in the illustration that the lowest peak loss for the test piece IV 152 pm m thickness appears at 2.5 MHz frequency. In the case of the conventional transducer of a same resonant frequency, the piezoelectric film 71 is required to have a thickness of 230 m, which is too large to produce easily. Further, this increased thickness causes lowering in electric capacity. In the case of the present invention, no lowering in capacity assures well match of the transducer to the electric power source. Example 7. Three sets of different transducers 80, 80 and 80 were prepared as shown in Figs. 21A through 21C. The transducer 80 test piece I shown in Fig. 21A c includes basically a Fig. 7A type transducer element in accordance with the present invention. That is, the transducer includes a polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric film 81 of 70 pm thickness, a polyethylene telephthalate additional layer 82 of 100 p m and coupled to the front side of the film 81 via a front side electrode 34a, a cropper reflector plate 86 of 50 m thickness 1.0 cm2 surface area and fixed to the rear side surface of the film 81, and a bakelite substrate 83 Z 4.84 x 106 kg m2.s backing the reflector plate 86. The transducer 80 test piece II shorn in Fig. 21B includes basically a Fig. 7A type transducer element in accordance with the present invention, also. That is, the transducer 81 includes a polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric film 81 of 14Q pin thickness, apolyethylene tele phthalate additional layer 82 of 25 m thickness and coupled to the front side of the film 81 via the front side electrode 84a, the copper reflector palte 86 fixed to the rear side surface of the film 81 , and the bakelite substrate 83 backing the reflector plate 86. The transducer 80 test piece m shown in Fig. 21C was prepared for comparison and conventional in construction.The transducer 80 includes a polyvinylidene fluorize piezoelectric film 81 of 76 p m thickness, the front side electrode 84a, a copper reflector plate 86 of 40 pm thickness, and a RIMA substrate 83 backing the reflector plate 86 . slater bath v as used for the acoustic transmission medium ATM and frequency characteristics of electric reflection loss Lilif were measured and is graphically shown in Sig. 22. It is clearly recognized in the graph that the resonant frequencies for the test pieces I and II are both shifted towards the lower side than that for the test piece 311. In particular, the test piece I presents a further minimal loss peak at a double frequency approximately equal to 10MHz.The system may be driven for operation by means of short pulse excitation also.Example 8. An electro acoustic transducer incorporating a Fig. 23Atype transducer in accordance with the present invention was used with a water bath as the acoustic transmission medium ATt. A polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric film of 76 pm thickness and 10 cm2 surface area was used for the polymer piezoelectric film, which was sandwitched by a pair of electrodes. This film was backed with three types of polyvinylidene fluoride additional layers in order to obtain test pieces I to III of the prevent invention. or comparison, 2 test piece IV without the additional layer was prepered also. Thus, particulars of the test pieces I to IV are as EMI48.1 Test SEP piece SEP Thickness SEP in SEP m SEP of SEP the SEP additional tb SEP tb SEP I SEP 19 tb SEP tb II SEP 38 tb SEP tb SEP III SEP 76 tb SEP IV SEP 0 tb SEP Frequency characteristics of electro acoustic conversion loss TLf were measured using the test pieces. In addition, frequency characteristics of electric reflection loss Lf was measures also using the test piece II, the result being disignated in the graph with a chain line curve. For comparison purposes, a transducr such as shown inFig. 25 A as prepared, .hich includes a like polyvinylidene fluoride ie.oelectric film accompanied rith a front side electrode, and, as a substitute for the polyvinylidene fluoride backing additional layer, a copper plate of 168 mIn this case, the copper plate acts as a rear side electrode also. Frequency characteristics of electro acoustic and electric reflection losses TLf and i ILf were measured and are shown in Sig. 25B, respectively.A water bath was used for the acoustic transmission medium AT , also. In Tig. 25fl, the minimal peak value for the electroacoustic conversion loss Ttf appears about the frequency of 7 EHz whereas, in Fig. 24, the test piece III has an almost similar resonant frequency for the electro acoustic conversion loss TLf. In the case of the comparative example shown in Fig. 25A, presence of the rigid thick copper plate in back of the piezoelectric film greatly kills flexibility of polyvinylidene used for the piezoelectrlc film. In contrast to this, use of the polymeric additional layer in combination with the polyvinylidene fluoride film does never damage the flexible nature of the latter. ig. 2 further indicates that simple adjustment in thickness of the additional layer enable free choice of the resonant frequency.Example 3. Fig. 26A depicts an electro acoustic transducer including a Fig. 23A type transducer element in accordance ith the present invention. That is, the transducer 90 includes a zolyvinylidene piezoelectric film 91 of 76 p m thickness and 10 cm2 surface area, a pair of electrodes 94a and 94b sandwiching the piezoelectric film 91, and a polyethylene telephthalate additional layer 92 in back of the rear side electrode 94b. Tne thickness of the additional layer is 25 p m for a test piece I and 100 m for a test piece IL, The additional layer 92 is backed by a copper reflector plate 96 of 168 m thickness, and further by a PiA substrate 93. A water bath was used for the acoustic transission medium ATM. Frequency characteristics of electro acoustic conversion loss TLf were measured using the test pieces I and II and the obtained result is shown in Fig. 263. The transducer used in this Example is different from that shown in Fig. 25A comparative example in that an additional layer 92 is interposed between the polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric film 91 and the copper reflector plate 96. Due to insertion of the additional layer, the resonant frequency is lowered from about 7 LtHz Fig. 25B to about 5 tEHz Fig. 263 . Thus, the effect caused by presence of the additional layer is clearly indicated. FEcr OF THE INVENTION The results of the above described Examples clearly indicate that use of the additional layer in the present invention, either on the front or rear side of the polyvinylidene piezoelectric film, assures apparent lowering in resonant frequency and broader frequency band for loss values characteristic curves. Simple adjustment in thickness of the additional layer enables low losses even at. high frequencies. An electro acoustic transducer with 10w losses can be produced without any increase in thickness of the polyvinylidene fluoride piezoelectric film hose mechanical loss is rather on the higher side. Presence of the additional layer gives reliable projection to the polyvinylidene film against a tide variety of thinkable external attacks.
