# Kit for treating mammals.

## Abstract
Improved methods of anesthesia for mammals, especial ly humans, are provided wherein the prolonging effect upon local anesthesia which is exhibited by co administration of vasoconstrictors, especially vasoconstrictors believed to act upon alpha adrenoreceptor sites on blood vessel walls, are provided. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, alpha adrenoreceptor blocking agents are administered subse quent to the performance of surgery or dentistry under local anesthesia accomplished through co administration of anes thesia and vasoconstrictor to cause reduction of prolonged anesthetic effect. Seriatim procedures are facilitated under local anesthesia through employment of the present inven tion. Improved patient aesthetics, diminution of self inflicted trauma, and increased sensory feedback from patients are among the benefits conferred by the present invention.
