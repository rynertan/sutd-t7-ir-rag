# A printed circuit board assembly for a rotary signal transmitter for use in a system for transmitting measurement data from a rotating body.

## Abstract
In the transmission of measurement data from a rotating body to a stationary receiver 11 a rotary signal transmitter mounted on a rotating shaft 16 employs a printed circuit. The problem arises of preserving the electronic components mounted on the printed circuit and their connections from damage due to centrifugal force. Also there is the problem of providing a rotationally balanced arrangement. A printed circuit board assembly 150 for such a rotary transmitter has a plurality of evenly circumferentially distributed printed circuit boards with their electronic components facing radial ly inwardly so as to resist damage due to centrifugal force. Connecting wires 19 connect the assembly 150 to a temperature sensor and the signal corresponding to the temperature is transmitted via a light emitting element 7 to a light sensitive element 12 of the receiver. Another arrangement employs rotationally balanced printed circuit discs extending radially. Multiplexing means may also be provided.

## Description
A PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD ASSEMBLY FOR A ROTARY SIGNAL TRANSMITTER FOR USE IN A SYSTEM FOR TRANSMITTING MEASUREMENT. DATA FROM A ROTATING BODY The present invention relates to a rotary signal transmitter and transmission system for detecting quantities to be measured such as temperatures of a rotating body and for transmitting the measurement data from the rotating body to a stationary receiver via a contactless transmission path and is particularly concerned with the structure of a printed circuit board assembly for a rotary transmitter in the measurement data rotary transmission system. In the synthetic fibre industry, metal rollers generally called roll heaters are used which are heated as by an induction heater and caused by a motor to rotate at high speeds for drawing and heat setting yarns. To produce yarns of good quality, the surface temperature of the roll heater should be controlled so as to be at an optimum for the yarn processing. It is necessary to detect the correct surface temperature of the metal roller and transmit the measurement data to a control device for the roller. A system is known which includes a temperature sensor embedded in the metal roller for producing an output signal this is delivered externally to a fixed stationary heater control device which comprises a central processing unit, the output signal being transmitted via a brush and a slip ring.The latter arrangement, however, does not enable the heater control device to pick up the output signal stably with precision over a long period of time. Since such a system fails to meet practical requirements, a contactless signal transmission system has been employed in the art. More specifically, the rotating body is equipped with a transmitter for converting the output from a temperature sensor to a predetermined signal form and for transmitting the latter to a fixed receiver via a contactless transmission path. Various systems are known which comprise such a transmitter. One system comprises a thermoresistance serving as a temperature sensor with its resistance variable with temperature, and a Wien bridge for detecting the resistance of the resistor and converting it to a frequency signal, which is then transmitted through a rotary transformer to the fixed receiver. In another system, a signal indicative of the resistance of the temperature sensor is amplified and frequency modulated by a modulator and is transmitted to the fixed receiver via a transmission circuit and an aerial. Still another system is characterised in that an output signal from the temperature sensor is converted to a corresponding frequency signal which is then converted by an electrooptical converter to a light signal that is optically transmitted from a light emitting element to a photosensitive element. Temperature signal transmission apparatus of the last mentioned type for transmitting light signals is shown in a schematic block circuit diagram in Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings, and a roll heater utilising such a temperature signal transmission apparatus is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2. In the apparatus shown in Fig. 1, a temperature signal transmitter 1, mounted on a roller of a roll heater, has a temperature sensor 2 for producing an output signal indicative of temperature, which is delivered through a voltage conversion circuit 3, an ,amplification circuit 4, a voltage to frequency conversion circuit 5, and an energisation circuit 6 to a signal transmitter or a light emitting element 7 which produces a light output signal. The temperature signal transmitter 1 is supplied with electric power from a fixed stationary receiver 11 through a secondary winding 8 of a rotary transformer serving as a power supply, a rectification circuit 9, and a constant voltage supply circuit 10. The fixed receiver 11 comprises a photosensitive element 12 disposed on the optical axis of the light emitting element 7 for receiving the light signal there from, and a conversion circuit 13 for converting the light signal to an electric signal, which is delivered to a central processing unit 14 which. serves as a heater control device. Designated at 8 is a stationary primary winding of the rotary transformer. A roll heater equipped with the temperature signal transmission apparatus thus constructed is shown in Fig. 2, and comprises a metal roller 18 mounted on one end of a rotational shaft 16 of a drive motor 15 and arranged to be heated by a fixed induction heater coil 17, the metal roller 18 having the temperature sensor 2 embedded therein. The other end of the rotational shaft 16 supports the transmitter 1 which is electrically connected to the temperature sensor 2 by means of a wire 19 extending through a central axial bore in the rotational shaft 16. The receiver 11 and the primary winding 8 of the rotary transformer are supported on a frame projecting laterally from a casing of the motor 15. The temperature sensor may comprise thermally sensitive elements such as a thermistor or a thermocouple as well as the thermoresist ance mentioned above. The circuits 3 to 6 of the transmission apparatus as shown in Fig. 1 are normally constructed as printed circuits including various electronic components such as ICs, miniature capacitors, resistors, transistors and diodes mounted on printed circuit boards. These electronic parts are soldered to the boards via thin wires, and hence are mechanically unstable. The wires are likely to be broken under undue external forces applied accident ally, resulting in damage to the mounted parts. Thus, the printed circuits require much attention when they are handled. Since the roll heater is driven to rotate at high speeds while in operation, the electronic components assembled and mounted on the roller are subjected to considerable centrifugal forces.There has therefore been much concern about how to safeguard against centrifugal forces imposed on the electronic components of the trans mitter. Various attempts have been made to provide assembly structures for electronic components to be mounted on the roller. None of the prior proposals have met practical requirements as they permit the electronic components to give way under centrifugal forces applied while the roller is revolving at high speeds. An effort has also been made r,to encase the printed circuits in plastics material for increased mechanical strength. The encasement of the parts however is disadvantageous in that the printed circuits cannot be inspected and the individual components cannot be replaced. It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple, reliable, easily assembled measurement data transmission system for use on a rotary body which will better withstand centrifugal forces imposed while the rotary body is revolving at high speeds, so reducing the risk of the system being damaged. According to this invention there is provided a rotary printed circuit board assembly for a signal trans mitter for mounting on the axis of rotation of a rotating body, said assembly comprising electronic components arranged on at least one printed circuit board in such a way that, in use, the centrifugal force acting on the electronic components will have no nett vector component directly urging the electronic components away from the plane of the printed circuit board. A rotary signal transmitter can incorporate such an assembly mounted on a shaft for rotation with the latter. A system for transmitting measurement data from a rotating body can include such a rotary signal transmitter connected to a sensor and arranged to transmit measurement data signals via a contactless transmission path to a stationary receiver connected to a data processing arrangement. Preferably, in the assembly, said one or more printed circuit boards and said electrical components are arranged such as to be balanced rotationally along any diameter of the assembly. In one embodiment of the assembly said one or more printed circuit boards each carry said electricalo3xxnu s only on a mounting surface of the printed circuit board that faces radially inwardly. The assembly may include a bobbin shaped attachment base having a pair of flanges, said electronic parts being secured to mounting surfaces of said printed circuit boards which face radially inwardly, said printed circuit boards being mounted on said pair of flanges and around said attachment base in circumferentially spaced and cylindrical arrangement. In such an arrangement it may be that each of said flanges is polygonal said printed circuit boards being secured to the polygon sides the number of which corresponds to the number of printed circuit boards.It may be useful to provide a binder wound around the arrangement of said printed circuit boards to fasten the latter together. Conveniently connection wires interconnect adjacent mounting surfaces of said printed circuit boards. In another embodiment of the assembly the or each said printed circuit board is in the shape of a disk to be mounted coaxially on a rptational shaft of the rotating body. It may be arranged that said electronic parts include elongate parts having longitudinal axes oriented radially. rIt is possible that said electronic parts include parts having contacts and oriented such that said contacts will be urged closed under centrifugal forces arising during rotation about said axis of rotation. Advantage ously said electronic parts include parts identical in shape and disposed diametrically opposite each other on respective sides of the axis of rotation. Expediently said electronic parts are mounted on a plurality of said disk shaped printed circuit boards which are mounted coaxially. Either embodiment may include means for multi plexing a plurality of signals for transmission. In one form of rotary signal transmitter said printed circuit board assembly has a boss on which is mounted a rotary transformer assembly of a secondary coil and a core and a stationary power supply being provided for supplying an electric current through said rotary transformer to a signal conversion circuit of the transmitter. Conveniently in a rotary signal transmitter a signal transmission device is provided comprising a lightemitting element, an end attachment base being removably secured to the axial end of said printed circuit board assembly to support centrally thereon said light emitting element, said light emitting element having its optical axis held in alignment with a central axis of said rotational shaft. Also it may include terminals mounted on said end attachment base on which said light emitting element is supported, and connection wires interconnecting a sensor and said printed circuit board assembly and connected to said terminals.Advantageously the transmitter has a disk shaped protective cover covering said end attachment base on which said light emitting element is mounted, said disk shaped protective cover having a central aperture through which said light emitting element can emit light, and openings through which connection wires on said end attachment base can be visually inspected. Where the printed circuit board assembly takes the form of said one embodiment mentioned above, the rotary signal transmitter may be arranged so that said printed circuit board assembly is secured to said rotational shaft by means of screws or pins extending through radial bores in said flanges, said bores being located between adjacent printed circuit boards such as not to be covered thereby. In such a case the transmitter may include a protective cover surrounding the printed circuit board assembly, said protective cover having a diameter approx imating an outside diameter of said assembly, and said protective cover having holes at predetermined positions for insertion therethrough of a screwdriver for turning the screws securing said printed circuit board assembly to said rotational shaft. A system for transmitting measurement data from a rotating body may include a plurality of sensors connected to the rotary signal transmitter. In one such system said plurality of sensors are mounted on a single rotating body, and multiplexing means are provided comprising a time sharing circuit for time sharing the output signals from said sensors and supplying the time shared signals to a signal conversion circuit for supplying signals for transmission. In another such system said plurality of sensors are mounted respectively on different rotating bodies, said signal transmitter for each rotating body having a light emitting element, a receiver comprising a plurality of condenser lenses disposed in respective confronting relationships to said light emitting elements, and an optical fibre cable connected optically between said condenser lenses and a central processing unit, and multiplexer means being arranged to control light signals emitted from said light emitting elements. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a schematic block circuit diagram of a rotary signal transmission system as employed in the prior art Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of a roll heater equipped with the system shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a side elevation, with the upper half in cross section, of a portion of a rotary signal transmitter embodying this invention Fig. 4 is an end view of the transmitter shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a cross sectional view taken along the line V V of Fig. 3 Fig. 6 is a side elevation of the transmitter with a protective cover assembly Fig. 7 is an end view of the transmitter shown in Fig. 6 Fig. 8 is a side elevation, with parts in cross section, of a nortion of a roll heater system embodying the signal transmitter shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 9 is a cross sectional view of a rotary signal transmission system forming a second embodiment of this invention Figs. 10 a to 10 c are a set of front and side elevational views of printed circuit boards forming portions of the system shown in Fig. 9 Fig. 11 is a cross sectional view of a rollheater system employing a multiplex rotary transmission system forming a third embodiment of this invention Fig. 12 is a schematic block circuit diagram of the transmission system used in the roll heater system shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 13 is a block circuit diagram of a multiplex rotary transmission system forming a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In Figs. 3 to 8, a signal transmitter 100 mounted on a rotational shaft 16 of a drive motor comprises an attachment base 120 for a printed circuit, an attachment base 130 for a light emitting element, a protective cover assembly 140, a printed circuit 150 mounted on the attachment base 120 and serving as a signal conversion circuit, a signal transmission or light emitting element 7 mounted on the attachment base 130, and a secondary coil 8 and annular core 181 of a rotary transformer which is to provide connection to a power supply. The attachment base 120 is moulded of aluminium, for example, and includes a boss 121 fitted over the rotational shaft 16 and a pair of larger diameter flanges 122,123 located respectively at one end of the boss 121 and at an intermediate position thereon, the attachment base 120 thus assuming the shape of a bobbin. The boss 121 has an axial extension 121g, extending leftward as shown of the flange 123 and supporting thereon the rotary trans former. The flanges 122,123 have outer peripheral surfaces serving as seats for printed circuit boards as described later and are each cut in the shape of a regular polygon a regular hexagon in the illustrated embodiment depending on the number of printed circuit boards to be mounted.The intermediate flange 123 has two threaded bores 124 extending radially inwardly from vertices of the polygonal shape and receptive of set screws 125 to fix the attachment base 120 to the rotational shaft 16. The vertices of the polygonal flange 123 are provided with flats to facilitate formation of the threaded holes 124. The core 181 on which the secondary winding 8 of the rotary transformer is wound is fitted over the boss extension 121 of the attachment base 120. The attachment base 130 is made of an electrically insulating material and removably secured to an end surface of the flange 122 of the attachment base 120 by means of bolts 131 Fig. 4 having threaded recesses in their heads. The attachment base 130 includes a disk shaped base plate 133 having a central aperture 132 for passage therethrough of connection wires, and an attachment base portion 134 integral with the base plate 133 and elongate diametrically of the transmitter, the base portion 134 projecting axially from the surface of the base plate 133.The attachment base portion 134 supports the lightemitting element 7 fitted therein which has its optical axis aligned with the central axis of the rotational shaft 16. The attachment base 130 also acts as a terminal base in that the attachment base portion 134 has on its sides terminals 135 to which are connected wires 19 connected to a temperature sensor. Designated at 136 are apertures communicating with the interior of the bobbin shaped attachment base 120 for passage therethrough of connection wires. The terminals 135 are attached to the sides of the attachment base 130 so that they can be screwed from the side. The terminals 135 are thus directed generally in a direction in which the rotary body rotates, thereby reducing the risk that the connection wires will be displaced on rotation of the rotary body. , The protective cover assembly 140 comprises a cylindrical cover 141 surrounding the periphery of the attachment base 120, and a cup shaped cover 142 axially covering the attachment body 130. The cylindrical cover 141 has one end fitted in a step on a shoulder of the core 181 of the rotary transformer and the other end held in engagement with the cup shaped cover 142. The cup shaped cover 142 is secured in position by means of bolts 143 which have screw threads engaging the threaded recesses in the heads of the bolts 131 which attach the base 130 to the base 120. The cylindrical cover 141 has holes 144 for insertion of a screwdriver for turning the set screws 125 with the cylindrical cover 141 still in place.The cup shaped cover 142 has a central opening through which the light emitting element is exposed, and side openings 145 through which the connection wires can be visually inspected. When the connection wires are to be connected to the terminals, the cup shaped cover 142 can be removed via clearance between the light emitting element and a photosensitive element arranged to receive the light from the light emitting element. The printed circuit 150 will now be described.Electronic components 151 of which the printed circuit 150 is composed are securely mounted on a mounting surface of each of a plurality six in the illustrated embodiment of rectangular printed circuit boards 152. The printed circuit boards 152 are disposed around the circumference of the attachment base 120 with the mounting surfaces facing radially inwardly The boards 152 extend between the polygonal flanges 122,123 and are secured to the outer faces of the polygonal flanges 122,123 by means of bolts 153. With the printed circuit boards 152 thus secured in place, the electronic components 151 are accommodated in a space defined by the boss 121 and flanges 122,123.The printed circuit boards 152 have corners angled to provide spces between adjacent boards which are large enough to expose the screw holes 124 for receiving the set screws 125 which attach the attachment base 120 to the rotational shaft 16. The printed circuit boards 152 as mounted on the attachment base 120 are securely fastened together by means a binding member 154 wound therearound to reinforce the boards 152 and so increase their mechanical strength against centrifugal forces imposed on the boards 152 while the rotary body is revolving. The binding member 154 may comprise an insulating yarn or tapes. In some cases, the printed circuit boards 152 may be secured to the base 120 only by means of the binding member 154, and the bolts 153 may be dispensed with. With this modified arrangement, the flanges 122,123 may be provided with radially inward recesses into which the ends of the printed circuit boards 152 can be fitted so that the boards 152 seat on the bottoms of the recesses, thus preventing the printed circuit boards 152 from being displaced circumferentially or axially. As an alternative, the binding member 154 may be dispensed with, and the printed circuit boards 152 may be held in position against centrifugal forces by means of the cylindrical protective cover 141. The cylindrical cover 141 of the protective cover assembly 140 has a diameter which is only slightly larger than the outside diameter of the assembly of the attachment base 120 and the printed circuit boards 152.With such an arrangement, if the set screws 153 become loose and tend to disengage from the boards 152 while the transmitter is revolving, they will hit the inner surface of the cylindrical cover 141 and be prevented from flying away. The connection wires are connected in the signal transmitter 100 as follows The wires 19 extending from the non illustrated temperature sensor through a central axial bore in the rotatable shaft 16 of the motor and through the central aperture 132 in the attachment base 130, are connected to the terminals 135, which are connected to the printed circuit 150 by means of connection wires extending through the apertures 136 in the attachment base 130, as shown in Fig. 4. The printed circuit 150 is connected to the light emitting element 7 by means of connection wires extending through one of the apertures 136. The printed circuit boards 152 are electrically interconnected by means of connection wires 155 which extend on the same side as the component mounting surfaces of the boards 152, as illustrated in Fig. 5.The crossover connection wires 155 thus connected between the boards 152 are thus inhibited from being forced off the boards 152 under the action of centrifugal forces. Fig. 8 illustrates an assembled transmission system as a whole. A receiver 11 is supported on a stationary bracket of a drive motor 15 by means of a support arm 160 and a flange 161 so that the receiver 11 is stationary with respect to the transmitter 100. The receiver 11 has a photosensitive element 12 whose optical axis is aligned with that of the light emitting element 7 in the transmitter 100. The flange 161 supports thereon an assembly comprising a primary winding 8 of the rotary transformer which extends around the secondary winding 8, and an annular core 181 surrounding the secondary winding 8 , the assembly being partially fitted into and secured by means of screws to the flange 161. The flange 161 projects axially but such that it will not interfere with turning of the set screws 125 in the attachment base 120 with a screwdriver.The transmitter 100 and the receiver 11 are protected by means of a dust cover 162 secured by means of screws to the flange 161. Designated at 163,164 are connection wires connected to the primary winding of the rotary transformer and to the output of the receiver 11, respectively. Thus, with the above described embodiment, the printed circuit in the transmitter comprises a plurality of printed circuit boards on which electronic components .,are securely mounted on surfaces thereof which face radially inwardly, the printed circuit boards being secured to and spaced circumferentially around the attach ment base at equal intervals.When the rotary body is rotated at high speeds, the electronic components are subjected to centrifugal forces which cause the components to be pressed against and so, supported by, the printed circuit boards, with the result that the connection wires between the electronic components which are mechanically weak and portions of the connection wires which are soldered to the printed circuit boards will not be subjected to undue loads which would otherwise damage them, and hence have an increased resistance to damage due to centrifugal forces. The printed circuit boards are circumferentially equi spaced around the rotational shaft of the rotary body and have a small radius of rotation, so that they do not impose an unbalanced load on the rotary body and particularly the drive motor, and enable smooth high speed operation of the rotary body.The printed circuit boards, attachment base for the light emitting element, rotary transformer, and protective cover assembly are so supported and structured that the rotary transmission system is reliable in operation and can be assembled and handled readily. Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate a different form of rotary transmission system. As shown in Fig. 9, the system is mounted on one end of a rotational shaft 16 of a drive motor 15, the other end of which shaft is connected to a roll heater not shown for co rotation. The roll heater has embedded in it a temperature sensor 2 that is electrically connected through connection wires 19 extending through a central axial bore in the rotational shaft 16 to terminals 253 on a printed circuit board 258.The drive motor 15 has a bracket to which there is attached a flanged casing 261 concentric with the rotational shaft 16 and which houses a primary winding 8 and a core 281 of a rotary transformer connected to a power supply, the primary winding 8 having end portions connected to exterior terminals 265. An attachment base 220 is in the form of a bushing for supporting a printed circuit 250 which comprises various electronic components which constitute the temperature signal transmitter 200, and is secured to the rotational shaft 16 by means of a set screw 225. The attachment base 220 supports on its periphery a core 281 and a secondary winding 8 of the rotary transformer which are positioned in a radially confronting relationship to the core 281 and the primary winding 8 . Posts 259 extend axially from an end face of the attachment base 220 and support a plurality of axially juxtaposed disk shaped printed circuit boards 256,257,258. On each printed circuit board, there are mounted a variety of circuit components 251 which jointly constitute the temperature signal transmitter which is rotatable with the rotary body.A light emitting element 7 is mounted on the outer most printed circuit board 258 in alignment with the axis ,of rotation thereof. The printed circuit boards 256 to 258 are well balanced during rotation due to their disk shaped configuration, and have an outside diameter which is smaller than the outside diameter of the core 281 for the secondary winding 8 so as to permit easy assembling of the rotary transformer. Support arms 260 are secured to the primary core 281 of the rotary transformer which is positioned in and secured to the flanged casing 261. A receiver 11 is fixed to the distal ends of the support arms 260, the receiver 11 being stationary with respect to the temper ature signal transmitter. The receiver 11 has a photo sensitive element 12 located substantially centrally thereof and in axially confronting relationship to the light emitting element 7 in the temperature signal transmitter 200. The electronic components 251 which constitute the printed circuit 250 are so mounted on the printed circuit boards 256,257,258 that the components will withstand centrifugal forces applied when the signal transmitter is rotated at high speeds, and keep unbalanced loads imposed on the rotary body to a minimum. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 10 a , relatively slender or elongate cylindrical components such as capacitors 511 and resistors 512 are mounted on the printed circuit board 256 with the longitudinal axes of the components directed radially of the board 256. Thus oriented, the components will not be subjected to bending stresses and will be protected from damage when subject to large centrifugal forces imposed when the signal transmitter is rotated at high speeds. As illustrated in Fig. 10 a , components of the same kind are preferably disposed in diametrically opposite relationship across the centre of the board 256 for balanced rotation of the rotary body without being subjected to eccentrically applied loads. As illustrated in Figs. 10 b and 10 b , the printed circuit board 257 carries thereon variable or trimmer resistors 513 each having a movable contact K and a fixed contact K2. The variable resistors 513 are so oriented on the board 257 that the movable contactsK1 will be pressed against the fixed contacts K2 under the action of the centrifugal forces imposed when the printed circuit board 257 is caused to rotate about its centre thus resulting in an increased degree of reliability, As shown in Fig. 10 c , the light emitting element 7 is located centrally of the printed circuit board 258.When the board 258 rotates, the optical axis of the lightemitting element 7 remains unchanged. The terminals 253, through apertures 258 in the board 258, and the connection wires 19 extending through the apertures, 258 are preferably positioned in diametrically opposite relationship to each other across the centre of the board 258 for balanced rotation of the latter. Where many more components are to be incorporated in the temperature signal transmitter, a plurality of further printed circuit boards of a smaller diameter are provided, and the components are distributed and mounted on the boards, which are disposed axially in tandem in a manner as shown in Fig. 9. With this arrangement, a large number of components can be installed on small diameter printed circuit boards. The components thus mounted will be subjected to relatively small centrifugal forces while the boards are rotating, and hence will be less susceptible to damage. Accordingly, the components are rendered highly reliable in operation though individually mechanically weak.The printed circuit boards and rotary transformer according to the embodiment shown in Figs. 9 and 10 are so supported that the transmission system is reliable in operation, and can be assembled and handled readily. While in the foregoing embodiments the optical signal transmission system using a light emitting element has been described, other systems such as those using radio waves or electromagnetism may instead be employed to transmit signals from a rotating transmitter to a stationary receiver via a contactless transmission path. The present invention is not limited to systems for transmitting signals indicative of measured temperatures, but is also applicable to systems for transmitting signals indicative of other physical and chemical quantities measured, and of electrical quantities such as a current and voltage in the rotor of an electrical rotary machine. The foregoing embodiments are directed to the assembly structures of signal transmitters in systems for transmitting measurement data from a rotary body. The rotary body, e.g. roll heater in the above embodiments has a signal sensor for detecting a quantity to produce a signal indicative of the detected quantity, which is transmitted to a central processing unit independent of a system including the rotary body. There are known some roll heaters for heat setting synthetic yarns where the roll heaters are designed so as to allow several turns or convolutions of yarn to be wound therearound. It is desirable from the standpoint of yarn quality control to enable the roll heater to be heated to different temperatures at varying points thereon. It is customary in factories for manufacturing synthetic yarns to have a multiplicity of yarn heat setting roll heaters heated under control of a central heating system. Thus, for the control of temperatures of a single roll heater having a plurality of sensors or a plurality of roll heaters each having a sensor, signals from the plurality of sensors are required to be delivered to a central controller or a central processing unit.Providing respective signal transmission paths for the sensor however would result in an increased number of connection wires required and a large space occupied by the connection wires. Furthermore, the signals as transmitted via the respective transmission paths would interfere with each other through electromagnetic induction and could not properly be delivered to the central processing unit. In still another embodiment, the above difficulties ran be eliminated by using a multiplex signal transmission system for use with a measurement data transmission apparatus for reliably transmitting signals via a simplified signal transmission path. Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate such a multiplex rotary signal transmission system. A pair of stationary induction heater coils 17,17 are disposed in a single roll heater 18 for heating different respective portions of the latter. A pair of temperature sensors 2,2 are embedded in the roll heater 18 at positions axially corresponding to the heater coils 17,17 for detecting the temperatures of the different portions of the roll heater 18. Connection wires 19,19 extend respectively from the sensors 2,2 axially through a rotational shaft 16 of a motor 15 to an electric circuit which constitutes a signal transmitter 300. Output signals from the sensors are converted to light signals which are delivered to a stationary receiver from which corresponding signals are transmitted to a central processing unit. The arrangement described above is substantially the same as those shown in Figs. 3 to 8 and 9 and 10. As illustrated in Fig. 12, output signals from the sensors 2, 2 are fed to a voltage to frequency converter 5 through a multiplexer comprising a time sharing circuit 370 and a voltage conversion circuit and an amplifier which are not shown. The time sharing circuit 370 comprises a clock pulse generator 371 and a switch 372. The output signals from the sensors 2,2 representing the analogue quantity temperature, are supplied through the wires 19,19 , respectively, to the switch 372 in the time sharing circuit 370. The switch 372 is alternated in state by clock pulses supplied from the clock pulse generator 371. An output signal from the switch 372 is applied to the voltage to frequency converter 5 in which the output signal is converted to pulses having a frequency proportional to the analogue quantity. An output signal from the voltage to frequency converter 5 is delivered to the light emitting element 7. Designated in Fig. 11 at 380 is a power supply 381 being an inverter serving as a power supply for controlling the motor 15, and 382 a signal transmission line for delivering output signals from the central processing unit or controller 14 to the heater coils 17,17 . The system thus constructed operates as follows Temperatures at different portions of the roll heater 18 while being rotated by the motor 15 are detected by the temperature sensors 2,2 which produce output signals that are delivered to and time shared by the time sharing circuit 370. The signals thus time shared are transmitted via the voltage to frequency converter 5,the light emitting element 7, the photosensitive element 12 and the converter circuit 13 to the central processing unit 14 which is independent of the system including the rotary body.The time shared signals are separated by the central processing unit 14 into respective signals indicative of the temperatures at the different portions of the roll heater 18 and used to control the induction heater coils 17,17 , that positionally correspond to the different roll heater portions, such as to heat the latter to desired temperatures. The photosensitive element 12 may be replaced with a condenser lens, and a transmission path 383 between the receiver 11 and the central processing unit 14 may comprise an optical fibre cable for transmitting signals from the rotating body by way of light communication. Signals indicative of temperatures detected may be frequencymodulated into radio wave signals which are picked up by an appropriate form of the receiver 11. The number of temperature sensors may be three or more though two sensors are shown in the above embodiment for brevity. The rotary transmission system shown in Figs. 11 and 12 thus comprises a plurality of temperature sensors disposed at different positions in a rotary body, a timesharing means for time sharing the output signals from the respective temperature sensors, and means for delivering the time shared signals by way of multiplex transmission to a central processing unit outside the rotary body. Thus, signals indicative of temperatures at different positions in a single roll heater can be transmitted via a simple transmission path to the central processing unit independently of the rotary body system. Fig. 13 shows a multiplex rotary transmission system in still another embodiment for transmitting together output signals from sensors in a plurality of roll heaters to a central processing unit. A pair of independent roll heaters not shown are associated respectively with a pair of signal transmitters 400,400 comprising temperature sensors 2,2 amplifiers 4,4 , voltage to frequency converters 5,5 , energisation circuits 6,6 , light emitting elements 7,7 , and constant voltage circuits 10,10 which are supplied with currents via respective rotary transformers. Fixed receivers 11,11 co operate respectively with the signal transmitters 400,400 and include condenser lenses 490,490 , respectively, facing the light emitting elements 7,7 and connected in parallel to a central snxessing unit 14 via a single optical fibre cable 491.A multiplexer or time sharing circuit 470 is connected to the energization circuits 6,6 in the signal transmitters 400,400 respectively, the time sharing circuit 470 comprising a clock pulse generator 471 and a pair of switches 472,472 connected to the energisation circuits 6,6 . The energization circuits 6,6 are alternately switched on and off in synchronisation with clock pulses from the clock pulse generator 471 for controlling the light signals 7a, 7a by determining the order in which the light signals 7a, 7a are discharged from the light emitting elements 7,7 and or varying the periods of transmission of the light signals 7a, 7a . The optical fibre cable 491 provides a common transmission path for the multiplexed light signals 7a, 7a to be delivered from the condenser lenses 490,490 to the central processing unit 14. Operation of the multiplex rotary transmission system shown in Fig. 13 is as follows. Output signals from the temperature sensors 2,2 are converted into amplified voltage signals by the amplifiers 4,4 respectively. The amplified signals are converted by the voltage to frequency converters 5,5 to signals indicative of frequencies, which are in turn converted by the energisation circuits 6,6 to signals that are intensive enough to energise the light emitting elements 7,7 respectively, dependent on the frequencies. The time sharing circuit 470 causes the light emitting elements 7,7 to emit the light signals 7a, 7a with different periods of transmission. The condenser lenses 490,490 pick up the light signals 7a, 7a and deliver them through the optical fibre cable 491 to the central processing unit 14.The central processing unit 14 separates the light signals 7a, 7a from each other to control the roll heaters not illustrated to be heated to desired temperatures by induction heating. While in the above embodiment two temperature sensors are employed, three or more temperature sensors may instead be incorporated. With the above described embodiment, signals indicative of temperatures detected from a plurality of roll heaters are converted to light signals which are controlled by the multiplexer before being transmitted to the central processing unit through the optical fibre cable. Thus, a number of signal transmission wires are unnecessary and wiring space can be greatly reduced. In addition, signals while being transmitted will not interfere with each other through electromagnetic induction, and hence can be transmitted without being adversely affected en route. Clearly either of the embodiments shown in Figs. 11 and 13 can be combined with either of the embodiments shown in Figs. 3 and 9, as well as with each other. It is apparent that the transmitters 100 and 200 described above include printed circuit board assemblies in which the electronic components are arranged on the printed circuit boards in such a way that, in use, the centrifugal force acting on the electronic components has no nett component directly urging the electronic compo nents away from the plane of the relevant printed circuit board. Thus a much more stable and secure configuration is obtained than when the components are secured to radially outer surfaces of the printed circuit boards. This reduces significantly the risk of damage to the printed circuit assembly.
