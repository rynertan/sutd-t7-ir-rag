# ELECTRIC HEATER ESPECIALLY FOR MACHINES AND TOOLS FOR PROCESSING OF PLASTICS

## Abstract
The substantial constructional part of the heater are heat guides 1 fastened to each other at one side by means of an articulated connector 14 and at the other side, through outriggers 22 , by means of a bolted joint 21 . The internal surfaces of the heat guides 1 represent the shape of the object being heated, and on the external surfaces there are a series of splines 2 , preferably flat ones. To the splines 2 of the heat flux guides 1 lamellar heating ele ments 3 are fastened. The mutual adherence surfaces of the heating elements 3 and splines 2 are shaped accord ing to geometrical patterns, the appropriate selection of which enables changing the thermal characteristic of the heater within a wide range. The heater may be supplied from single or three phase mains. The heater is applicable especially for heating of cylinders, nozzles and tools of in jection moulding machines and extrusion machines.
