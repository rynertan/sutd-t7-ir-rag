# Soft seeded tougheners for polyvinyl chloride.

## Abstract
The impact resistance of rigid polymeric resins e.g. PVC, SAN, PMMA, etc., is enhanced by the incorporation therein of an improved toughener. This toughener comprises three distinct phases a a core of thermoplastic or thermoset resin having a Tg below room temperature, b a rubberlike layer overpolymerized on the core, and c a relatively hard polymer overpolymerized on the rubber layer. The utilization of a soft core, or seed, apparently enhances the efficiency of the toughener in the rigid polymer. In one of the preferred embodiments of this invention, the improved toughener comprises a seed derived from a partially crosslinked poly n butylacrylate , a rubber like or intermediate layer derived from a monomer mixture containing n butylacrylate and an addition monomer and an outer layer or shell derived from a monomer mixture containing styrene and methylmethacrylate.
