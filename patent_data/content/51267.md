# Low curing epoxy N resin coating composition and its use for coating a substrate.

## Abstract
A coating composition comprising a dispersion of an epoxy resin, a nitrogen resin crosslinker such as a melamine formaldehyde, a particulate fluorocarbon such as PTFE, and citric acid can be applied to substrates such as polysulfones and cured at low temperatures on the order of 107 C. The resulting coating is especially useful as a barrier to seal the surface of the substrate and to improve abrasion resistance.
