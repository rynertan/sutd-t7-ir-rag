## Description
Novel CompositionsThe present invention relates to veterinarily acceptable compositions, in particular to veterinarily acceptable compositions of Mupirocin formerly known asPseudomonic acid or veterinarily acceptable salts thereof.Mupirocin or pseudomonic acid, together with salts and esters thereof are described in U.K. Patent No.1395907.Mupirocin and veterinarily acceptable salts thereof are known also to be of use as growth promoters in animals in particular pigs, as described in UK patent No.2097670. However these compounds are often found to have low stability when incorporated directly into animal feed.We have now discovered a composition of mupirocin or veterinarily acceptable salts thereof which may be incorporated into feed with little loss of potency.Accordingly, the present invention provides a veterinary composition comprising granules of mupirocin or a veterinarily acceptable salt thereof and a binder.Suitably, the salt of mupirocin is a metal salt for example an alkali metal an alkaline earth metal or a silver salt.A preferred salt is an alkaline earth metal salt. A particularly preferred salt is a calcium salt.Suitably the calcium salt is present as a crystalline dihydrate.Suitable binders include optionally substituted C1 6 alkyl ether derivatives of cellulose, acacia, tragacanth, gelatin, starch or modified starches, alginic acid and salts thereof and polyvinylpyrollidone.Preferred binders are optionally substituted C16 alkyl ether derivatives of cellulose.The cellulose derivative may include one or more optionally substituted C16 alkyl group s which may be the same or different.Suitably optional substituents on the C16 alkyl group include hydroxy and carboxy.Examples of suitable optionally substituted C16 alkyl ether derivatives of cellulose are ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, preferably ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose.Suitably the granules comprise mupirocin or a veterinarily acceptable salt thereof substantially coated with the binder.The composition may also comprise a diluent such as microcrystalline cellulose lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, starch, soya meal, calcium carbonate or whey powder. Preferably the diluent is microcrystalline cellulose or lactose, most preferably lactose.When a diluent is present, the granules suitably comprise matrix of mupirocin or a veterinarily acceptable salt thereof and diluent, substantially coated with a of binder.Suitably, the mupirocin or veterinarily acceptable salt thereof as free acid , is present in the composition in the range of from 1 to 98 w w of the composition, more suitably 10 to 80 w w and preferably 50 w w.Suitably, the binder is present in the composition in the range of from 2 to 20 wiw of the composition, preferably 5 to 10 w w.Suitably the diluent may be present in the range of from 0 to 97 w w of the formulation.When the diluent is lactose it is preferably present in the range of from 30 to 60 w w of the formulation.The compositions of the invention may be prepared by admixing the constitutents, preferably in powder form, with a suitable solvent, for example an organic solvent such as n hexane or isopropanol, or water and then removing the solvent.The process is preferably carried out at ambient or slightly elevated temperatures for example 20 600C.When mupirocin calcium preferably as the crystalline dihydrate, is present in the formulation a preferred temperature range is from 40 C to 600C.Preferably the solvent is removed in vacuo. The compositions of the invention may be administered to animals in any convenient veterinarily acceptable form. Suitably the formulations may be admixed with feed which can be administered in pellet form.Compositions comprising Mupirocin or a veterinarily acceptable salt thereof are preferably admixed with feed. Suitably the amount of granules is such that the pseudomonic acid content of the feed is from 5 lOOppm preferably 20 ppm.The following Examples illustrate the invention. Example 1 w wMupirocin calcium dihydrate 50 equivalent to free acid Ethyl Cellulose 5 grade N10 Lactose to 100Mupirocin calcium pseudomonate was hammer milled through an 0.04 inch screen. The milled salt was then placed in a vacuum mixer which had a water jacket for heating the mixer contents during processing. The other dry powdered ingredients were then added. During mixing, the powders were heated to 500C. Isopropanol was added and the mixing continued for about 10 minutes. The mass was then placed under vacuum, and mixing continued, re heating if required, until dry granules were obtained.Example 2 w wMupirocin calcium dihydrate 94.7Ethyl cellulose 5.3 grade N10 The above constituents were processed as in Example 1 until dry granules were obtained. Example 3 w wMupirocin 10.7Ethyl cellulose 8.9 grade T10 Microcrystalline cellulose 80.4The mupirocin and microcrystalline cellulose were mixed together dry, then a 14 w w solution of ethyl cellulose in cyclohexane was added until a wet granular mass was obtained on stirring. The mass was passed through a 20 mesh sieve and then dried at room temperature to provide dry granules. Stability Data 1.
