# CONFIGURATION OF A METAL INSULATOR SEMICONDUCTOR WITH A PROCESSOR BASED GATE

## Abstract
A method for fabricating a metal insulator semiconduc tor includes first forming a substrate 10 having an array of switching elements formed therein. A plurality of deform able lndium pads 28 and 30 are then formed on the surface of the substrate and in contact with each of the switching elements. A superstrate is formed from a layer of mercury cadmium telluride 32 and a layer of dielectric insulating material 34 . The superstrate is pressed down adjacent the substrate 10 with the upper surface of the conductive gates 28 and 30 contacting the lower surface of the dielectric layer 34 . The deformable pads 28 and 30 conform to the lower surface of the dielectric layer 34 . Epoxy 36 is then disposed in the interstices of the device to provide an adhesive force between the substrate 10 and the superstrate. The thickness of the mercury cadmium telluride layer 32 is then decreased to reduce the path length for photon generated carriers created at the upper surface to diffuse to the diametrically opposite side.
