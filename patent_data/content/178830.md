# Continuous mixer.

## Abstract
Apparatus for mixing powdered and liquid materials to form slurries comprising a mixer body 11 having an inlet 12 for such materials and parallel mixing chambers 14 15 extending to a discharge outlet 18 . Rotors 16 17 are mounted for rotation in the chambers 14 15 and include feed sections 20 leading from the inlet 12 to mixing sections 22 and to the outlet 18 . The mixing section 22 of each rotor includes a first lobed mixing portion 24 having short advancing helices 26 , and reverse helices 27 adapted to quickly wet and pressurize the mixture to force entrapped air back through the inlet 12 . The mixing section 22 also has a second mixing portion 30 having an increased number of lobes 32 following the first portion 24 to increase the mixing action and shear on the mixture. The second mixing section 30 is followed by a lobed discharge section 36 adapted to impel the mixture through the outlet 18 .
