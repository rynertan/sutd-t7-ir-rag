## Description
This invention relates to diaphragm valves. The construction anQhperation of diaphragm valves are well known to those skilled in the valve art and consequently a detailed description thereof is not deemed necessary herein. Suffice it to say that in referring to diaphragm valves w mean a valve sealing on the periphery of a diaphragm with either a flat or non flat sometimes called saddle shaped flange. The present invention is particularly concerned with the design of diaphragms employed in diaphragm valves. In designing such diaphragms there is a possibility of excess elastomer being incorporated in the diaphragm which renders its flexing characteristics variable under different usage conditions, and it is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate this drawback. According to the present inventiun there is provided a diaphragm for a diaphragm valve, the diaphragm is moulded to have a configuration which is skewed or curvilinearly inclined towards the diaphragm periphery. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way cf example, with referen e to thc accompanying drawings, in uhich Fig. 1 is a plan view of a preferred diaphragm design Fig. 2 is a section on the line II Ii of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a vieu of the diaphragm looking in the direction of arrow X of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a side elevation of a diaphragm valve incorporating a diaphragm according to the invention Fig. 5 is a section on the line IV IV of Fig. 4 Fig. 6 is a plan vieu of the diaphragm Fig. 7 is a part sectional end view of the diaphragm on the line VII VII of Fig. 6 and Fig. 8 is a fragmentary sectional vieu of another aspect of a diaphragm valve according to the invention. Referring to Figs. 1 to 3 there is shown a preferred diaphragm design which it is considered obviates the problem of the incorporation of excess elastomer when designing a diaphragm and consequently provides for a more uniform flexing characteristics of the diaphragm irrespective of the operational usage of the diaphragm valve. Consider the arbitrarily spaced lines Ju and K Fig. 1 on the saddle shaped diaphragm 10. At certain positions the moulded lengths of 3 and fK in a conventionally designed diaphragm are loner than required and the diaphragm 10 deforms and this can seriously distort the shape of section II II. With such previous designs the amount of excess elastomer has tended to increase for sections similar to J and irk with positions closer to the central boss 11, i.e. there will be greater excess rubber along 0 than along K . Fig. 3 shows that the sections taken generally relative to the centre of the diaphragm 10 riave been constructed from curves which closely resemble a series of blending radii. The outline of such a section in a conventional diaphragm is shown dotted as indicated at 12. A better section shape is one according to the present invention which shows a pronounced skew 13 towards the diaphragm periphery. Such a shap largely overcomes the problems of excess rubber. With many thick diaphragms it is difficult to control where and how they flex during opening and closing. The ideal is a diaphragm which will behave in the same way whether it be used for pressure or vacuum on a hot or cold service. The position of the pressure plate of the customary compressor 14 seeFig. 5 should dictate the shape of the diaphragm 10.Control can be achieved by using any of the following singly or in combination i Local thickening 16 and or local thinning rig. 2 at point H where the initial or primary fold of the diaphragm occurs. ii The use of local compounds of different stiffness to produce the main body of diaphragm. iii The shape and positioning of stud or studs 1 uhich are used to fix the diaphragm 10 to the compressor 14. iv The use of reinforcement for example woven synthetic fabrics, and where same is used in the diaphragm. Referring now to Figs. 4 to 7, it can be seen that the valve comprises the customary body 18, diaphragm 10, cover 19 and operating handwhsel 20. In this instance, the cover 19 is correctly positioned on the body 18 by one or more locating tongues 21. It will be manifest that the locating tongue or tongues can be provided on the cover 19 and or the body 18. As a result the bolts or studs 22 which secure the cover 19 to the body 18 need not serve the function of accurately locating the cover on the body. The bolt as receiving holes can be widely toleranced or in the present example replaced by open lugs 23 on both the body 18 and cover 19. The clearances between the tongue 21 and mating components of the valve are massured as shown by dimensions l,ui and x. These dimensions are dictated by the configuration of the peripheral flange of te valve. For example, with a non flat Vee form flange which has substantial self locating characteristics, the only guidance required will be given by dimension x . By comparison, with a valve body having a flat peripheral flange the tongue or tongues 21 are required to give complete location on assembly and the clearances tw and x will be very small. The tongues can be of dovetailed configuration if desired. When open lugs 23 are employed as in Fig. 4, assembly of the valve is assisted by locating the bolts 22 in position prior to tightening by means of moulded lugs 24 see Fig. 6 on the diaphragm 10. It is known that it is desirable to control the amount of compression of the peripheral flange of the diaphragm 10 between the cover 19 and the body 18.In rig. 6, each bolt hole 25 is surrounded by one of the ears 24 which is more resistant to compression than the material used to make the flexible portions of the diaphragm 10. This can be achieved by making the ears 24 from a harder compcund or by means of a robust insert 26 around the bolt hole 25, or a combination of both. In Fig. 7 the thickness of the ear 24 may be such that T2 is less than T1. This feature can be used as a visual indication so that on final assembly of the diaphragm T2 T1. Alternatively, it can be used in combination with the ears of Fig. 6. It is desirable to reduce the forces acting to pull the diaphragm 10 away from its attachmont stud 17. A typical application is one involving a vacuum and although adequate performance can be obtained by using reinforcing fabrics around the stud 17 and bonding the stud 17 to ths diaphragm elastomer we propose to use a new design feature. Figure 7 shows a moulded diaphragm 10 uhich has its centre portion a distance z away from the flange datum. On assembly and in operation thP stroke of the diaphragm will be less than z by a predetermined amount. With good design the operational forces tending to detach the diaphragm 10 from the stud 17 can be considerably reduced and even eliminated.Such forces arise from the need to assemble diaphragm valves in the closed or nearly closed position, and also from vacuum forces when the diaphragm valve is being employed in a vacuum duty. Considering the diaphragm of Fig. 4 which is moulded with a saddle shaped flange, there is a tendency for dimension z to increase if the saddle shape is made flatter on assembly. If this is resisted the diaphragm 10 will always push onto the stud 17.This design technique can be used for both flat and non flat flanged designs and is most effective when a moulding with a non flat flange is assembled onto a body with a flat flange. The same diaphragm can be satisfactorily used with its peripheral flange clamped between either flat or saddle shaped flange. By using a suitably shaped section between the diaphragm 10 and the cover flange it is possible to use a standard cover assembly. There are occasions when a valve body with a flat flange may be moe suitable than one with a saddle shaped flange.This can arise with flow control applications or when a valve manifold is employed. The manner in which a saddle shaped diaphragm flexes between open and closed positions is difficult to predict. Its flexing characteristics are far more complex than those of a diaphragm made with either a flat flange or a flange described as a frustrum of a cone. Care is necessary with the design of saddle shaped diaphragms if locking up due to excess elastomeric material is to be avoided around a critical stage of flexing which is usually around the mid open position.This condition can be avoided by maintaining gentle contour curves as shown in rig. 6. Fig. 7 also shows that it is important for the effective radius of sectors about th3 centre R1 not to be less than half the radius close to the periphery R2. Referring once again to Fig. 5 there is shown a stud 17 for holding the diaphragm 10 onto the pressure plate 14. The stud 17 is permitted a small controlled amount of movement y relative to the pressure plate 14. A valve according to the invention has been designed to avoid overclosure damage to diaphragms. However, there is a requirement for certain valves to have the facility to be deliberately so damaged. For example, with existing diaphragm valves it is possible due to fire in a plant for the diaphragm in such a valve to be destroyed resulting in very serious loss of control of the pipeline fluid. If a valve is designed according to this invention with raised ribs on the face of the pressure plate, then the application of a high closing force will guillotine through. the diaphragm thus reducing the area through which uncontrolled fluid can escape. The position of the ribs on the pressure plate is selected to give good control to limit the leakage of pipeline fluid both to atmosphere and across the valve set.The shape of these ribs, the compounding of the diaphragm and itSthickness can all be made. to give a predictable and acceptable flex life under normal operation conditions. and There are manufacturing technical advantages in making diaphragms with little or no reinforcing fabric and ta ing advantage of the natural elasticity of the elastomeric material of the diaphragm. For satisfactory diaphragm operation of such non reinforced diaphragm shaver forces must be kept to a minimum and this is achieved by keeping the clearance between the compressor 14 and the cover 18 small, sse dimension v in Fig. 8. In practice the clearance should not be more than the thickness of the diaphragm. Finally, it should be noted that a saddle shaped diaphragm can readily be used with a cover or bonnet having a saddle facets clamping surface and a body with a flat clamping surface if a properly configured adaptor or make up member is fitted to the bonnet.
