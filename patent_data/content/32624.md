# Apparatus and method for the continuous manufacture of foam board.

## Abstract
A plastics foam forming mixture 20 is dispensed between upper and lower paper sheets 11 and 17 and the whole conveyed through metering rollers 14 and 15 to spread the mixture. The mixture is allowed to expand under a constant pressure supplied by a floating drag platen 21 . Suction is applied to the upper sheet through apertures in the platen. Suitably the platen consists of a series of rigid slats 22 hinged lengthwise transversely to the direction of the sheets, imparting longitudinal flexibility to the platen in that direction. Suction may be applied through apertures in the ends of every third or fourth slat. Improves the even ess of foam board.
