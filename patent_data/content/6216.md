# Improvements in digital data processing systems.

## Abstract
A system in which a plurality of data processing sy stems are interconnected as nodes in a telecommunica tion network. When two intelligent nodes are connected and one local node determines that a process requires the use of resources held at the second remote node, the local system sends a request to the remote system. The remote system wants to handle the request as it hand les all other requests so that source integrity is main tained. The local system in response to the local request sends it along a communication link to the remote system. The remote system receives the request and creates a new unit of work. The remote system then performs the unit of work and sends the result back to the local node. The local system receives the result and returns it to the requesting application process.
