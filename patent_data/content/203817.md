## Description
DESCRIPTION POLYMERIC COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to compositions and methods using such compositions to improve filler and fines retention in papermaking processes. Paper may be defined as a matted, felted or fibrous sheet which is formed on a fine wire screen from a liquid, pulp suspension. Usually, the fibers used to form paper are those derived from wood, with a smaller amount of cotton, straw, flax, or other vegetable fibers being utilized. The preparation of paper in an acceptable form involves the process of pulping, bleaching and refining. Pulp processes may be either mechanical ol chemical or combinations of both. In most cases, after the raw fibers are produced as a result of the pulping stage, the pulp is given a bleaching or brightening treatment. Commonly, the last step before papermaking involves beating and fining, which are sometimes referred to as stock preparation. The pulp fibers ás they emerge from the digester and bleach system, if they were run directly over the paper machine, would form paper of low strength and high absorbency because of the stiffness and poor bonding of the fibers. Strength may be developed in the paper by the processes of beating and refining.In many cases, during these beating or refining stages, other additives are added to the paper stock to improve certain desired characteristics. For instance, rosin soap may be added to impart water resistance. Starch or gum material may be added for strength. Fillers are commonly added to increase the opacity, improve printability of the resulting paper, and to provide,In many instances, a more brilliant whiteness. Commonly these fillers are inorganic substances such as talc, clays, calcium carbonate, and titanium dioxide pigments. Also, sizing agents may be added to the pulp before it is formed into a sheet. Such sizing agents commonly comprise wax emulsions or soaps. During the actual formation of the paper sheet, two types of general machines are commonly used the Fourdrinier machine and the Cylinder machine. In both types of machines, the sheet is formed on a traveling screen or cylinder, then dewatered under roller pressure, and dried by heated rollers and finished by calendar rolls.The pulp fibers remain on the screen or cylinder while a great portion of the water, containing unretained fiber fines and unretained filler, drains through the screen or cylinder. Accordingly, it is important to retain these fines and filler materials on the paper so that the desired characteristics may be imparted to the resulting paper. In US A 3 141 815, the use of polyethylene oxide polymers as a retention aid to improve inorganic filler and fiber fines retention in paper manufacture is disclosed. In US A 4 070 236, a retention aid comprising a polyalkylene oxide of. molecular weight in excess of one million and a phenol or naphthol formaldehyde or sulfur resin is added to the pulp. At Column 2 of US A 4 070 236, it is stated that the retention agent utilized may be employed in conjunction with other retention agents such as polyamide, amine, polyalkylene, e.g., polyethylene, imine, polyamine and polyacrylic amide types. Of similar import is JapanesePatent Application 45 33361 which discloses the use of nonionic polyacrylamides which may be added to a paper stock solution.The abstract of saidJapanese Patent Application further points out that polyethylene oxides having molecular weights of. greater than 4.5 million may be used as dispersants. Other patent specifications which may be of interest include US A 4 282 059 US A 3 332 834 US A 3 725 195 and US A 4 305 781. Despite the approaches taken by the prior art, there remains a need for an inexpensive fines and filler retention aid which is capable of improving paper formation, increasing drainage, and resulting in less suspended solids in the white water discharge to savealls or to mill waste. In accordance with the invention, it has been found that a polyalkylene oxide polymer used in combination with a high molecular weight polyacrylamide polymer surprisingly increases the retention of solids in paper mill furnishes. The polyalkylene oxide polymer pref erably is a polyethylene oxide polymer. Although the molecular weight of the polyethylene oxide polymer may vary from about loooso to 7000000 g a molecular weight of from around 1000000 , to 7000000 is preferred. Such polyalkylene oxide materials are well known in the art and their methods of synthesis need not be repeated here. As to the polyacrylamide polymers which may be used, noni onic, anionic, and cationic copolymers are acceptable. At present, It is preferred to use a cationic polyacrylamide copolymer comprising acrylamide based repeat units and repeat units comprising a polyqua ternary ammonium salt of a dialkylaminoalkyl acrylate. Specifically, it is desired to use the dimetnylsuiphate quaternary amonium salt of diethylaminoethyl acrylate. The polymer preferred is a copolymer of acrylamide and 5 6 mole percent of the dimethylsulphate quaternary am monium salt of diethylaminoethyl acrylate. Another exemplary cati onic polyacrylamide that can be mentioned is a copolymer of acryl amide repeat units and repeat units of the methyl chloride quaternary ammonium salt of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate. As to the nonionic polyacrylamides which may be utilized, these may be chosen from polyacrylamide homo polymers and slightly or partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide homopol ymers . One such slightly or partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide has a degree of hydrolysis of around 31. As to the anionic polyacrylamides which may be utilized, a copolymer of acrylic acid and acrylamide is preferred. All of the above polyacrylamide polymers are commercially available and known in the art. Hence, details of preparation thereof need not be repeated herein. Compositions in accordance with the invention may comprise from 5 to 95 weight percent of the polyalkylene oxide polymer and from 95 to 5 weight percent of the polyacrylamide polymer. Most preferably, however , the weight ratio of polyalkylene oxide polymer to polyacrylamide polymer is within the range of from about 0.05 to 0.33 1. Other materials including inert salts such as sodium sul phate, sodium chloride, alum, etc. may be included in the retention compositions of the invention.

The invention will now be further discribed with reference to the following Examples which demonstrate the efficacy of the polyalkylene oxide polymer acrylamide based polymer combination in enhancing filler and fines retention, but it is in no manner limited thereto. A A Britt Jar test method was used to generate the data in the following Tables. The Britt Jar is an assembly with a sample chamber, agitator, and screen.Generally, 500 ml of paper mill furnish head box consistency is placed in the filtrate sample collected. The solids in the filtrate are determined by filtering through pre weighed quantitative filter paper. Filtrate solids are the fines that are not retained. Percent fines retention is determined by comparing filtrate fines to the quantity of fines in 100 ml of the original furnish. S Fines Retention Fines in 100 ml Furnish Fines in 100 ml Filtrate X 100 Fines in 100 ml Furnish Data in Table I were obtained from Britt Jar testing of a fine white paper mill headbox stock. The data In Tables II and III were obtained from Britt Jar tests of a standard acid furnish prepared in our laboratory. Britt Jar tests were conducted at 1000 rpm using a 76u screen. Dosages for polymers were expressed in lbs T. This dosage is the pounds of active polymer solids per ton of solids in the furnish. At a typical furnish consistency of 0.65 , a polymer dosage a 0.41 kg per metric ton 1 lb T corresponds to 3.15 ppm. Table I The Effect of Percent PEO on Britt Jar Fines Retention .

PEO 4M2 MW The above Tables indicate that synergistic effects were observed when PEO was blended in different ratios with the various po yacrylamide polymers. The cationic polyacrylamide polymers seeTable II especially performed the best in these examples and hence are presently preferred for use. Preferably, the weight ratio of polyalkylene oxide polymer polyacrylamide polymer is within the range of about 0.05 to 0.33 1. Table III indicates that the MW of the PEO component of the combined treatment may vary over a wide range. During the performance of testing relative to the invention, disappointing results occurred in only two instances. In the first, a paper stock of presently unknown constituency from an upstate New York location was tested. Here, PEO itself did not significantly increase filler and fines retention and the same could be said about the cationic polyacrylamide same polymer as in Table I PEO combination. It is not presently known why this test rendered the noted results. In the other disappointing test, a synthetic laboratory alkaline papermaking furnish comprising a 50 50 blend of kraft hardwood softwood pulp, calcium carbonate, and starch at a pH of 7.5 was prepared. Here, once again the PEO by itself did not significantly increase filler and fines retention. The combined cationic polyacrylamide same as Table I PEO run also failed to show significant improvements.
