# Educational game of cards based on chemistry.

## Abstract
An educational game of cards based on chemistry is realized by two packs of cards on which fancy images and symbols representing chemical elements with their valences and atomic weights are printed. The cards of one pack refer to metals and oxygen, the cards of the other pack refer to non metals, or metalloids, and oxygen. The game consists in joining together groups of cards of the one or of the other pack, so that these combinations represent the formation of molecules according to the laws of chemistry, on the base of the elements and their valences.

The cards representing hydrogen, barium, calcium, strontium and sodium can have their background coloured, unlike the other cards of the metal pack which have a white background to recall only said elements may form peroxides with oxygen,.The game is played as follows once taken the metal card pack f,.i,. consisting of seventy cards thirty eight of which referring to nineteen metals and thirty two to oxygen, these are shuffled and cut and the dealer deals out the cards , still covered, to the players, five each, in a certain direction, placing the first of the cards not delt out uncovered beside the covered pack, this card forming the base of the uncovered card pack the leading player may collect the uncovered card or take the first two cards from the pack, discarding one uncovererd from the whole he has got in his hands, but this cannot be a card with negative marking thus for all other player in order to obtain markings is necessary to lay down cards, which will form such oxides that the minimum opening marking of twelve is obtained, adding the number values of the pertinent valen ces it is possible to lay down the opening or other oxydes during the following rouds, however without modifying the molecules already laid down, only in the order of the sense of the game, after having taken a card or cards before discarding it is not possible to use more than one value of the valences of the same card representing a metal to form oxides whereas more than one oxygen card may be united at the same time in order to reach the necessary valence value to obtain the oxide closing of the phase of the game with the metal card pack takes place when a player declares that he has finished laying all cards in his hands combined in oxides plus the possible cards with negative value down on the table before taking a card or cards this in such a way that he need not to discard one single card the player who closes receives a prize of 5 points to be added to the marking, deriving from the oxide molecules laid down on the table on the base of one point for each combined valence unit, deducted the negative values of those cards, which cannot contribute to the formation of molecules, these negative values being indicated on the cards themselves, whilst the other players receive a positive marking for the oxide molecules they previously laid down on the table and a negative marking for the cards still in their hands, considering the lowest value of the valence for each atom, as well as for the cards with negative markings indicated on them,. Then the second phase of the game takes place with the same metal card pack, proceeding as before after having shuffled and cut the card finally a third phase of the game takes place in an analogous way with the metalloid or non metal card pack still of seventy cards, thirty nine of which referring to fourteen metalloids and thirty one to oxygen , bearing in mind that instead of oxides anhydrides are formed,. The markings obtained by the single players during the three phases of the game, added up algebrically, define the winner of the game, that is the player, who obtained the highest number of markings,.Alternatively, the game can be played with both card packs mixed together,.The positive markings obtainable by means of chemical combinations are thus determined according to the involved valencesWith the metal card pack Protoxides 2 metal atoms t oxygen atoms H20 Ag20 Cu2O Na20 Hg2o Four points for each protoxide.Oxides t metal atom 1 oxygen atom BaO CaO CrO CuO FeO MgO MnO PbO SnO SrO HgO NiO ZnO,.
