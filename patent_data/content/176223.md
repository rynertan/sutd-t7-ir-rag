# Cooling means for electric cookers.

## Abstract
A floor standing electric cooker is provided comprising a casing 21,29 , a hob 10 , an upper oven 12 and a lower fan oven 14 housed in an oven space of the casing above a plinth 16 . Convective cooling air 27 enters the plinth 16 and a first part flows through openings 25 in floor 24 through the oven space, discharging through hob opening 33 . A second part 30 flows from the rear of the plinth 16 up wall 29 . When the lower oven 14 is in use cooling fan 37 coaxial with oven fan 36 provides a forced flow of cool outside air into the oven space. Air is ducted by cover 41 past terminals 40 to fan inlet 38 whereby the terminals 40 are kept cool when the lower oven 14 is on. Despite the compactness of the cooker, the cooling of sidewalls 21 is sufficiently effective for them to butt against kitchen units without an air gap.
