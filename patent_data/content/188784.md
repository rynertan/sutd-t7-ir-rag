# Composite pipe, process for producing the same, and heat pipe using the same.

## Abstract
A composite pipe 1 is proposed which is comprised of an aluminum pipe 2 and a lead pipe 3 formed in the aluminum pipe 2 in direct contact with the inner wall of the aluminum pipe 2 . The composite pipe 1 is produced by supplying a lead pipe 3 to a continuous aluminum extru sion machine 6 which can extrude while enveloping a long object, to form an aluminum pipe 2 on the outer periphery of the lead pipe 3 . A heat pipe using the composite pipe 1 is also proposed.
