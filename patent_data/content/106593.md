# NOZZLE CONTROL APPARATUS

## Abstract
An elongate nozzle 30 , such as provided by a slice 20 in the delivery of feed stock from a headbox 12 to the Foudrinier wire 24 of a paper making machine or by the lips of a sheet plastics extrusion die, has its delivery height profile 5 adjustable at points alone the nozzle 30 by electro hydraulic actuator devices 40 which are coupled to the upper slice lip 26 or one lip of the extrusion die. Each device 40 comprises a servo motor 130 whose piston 48 is coupled to the lip 26 and an electrically energized torque motor 110 which controls the servo motor 130 via a servo control valve 120 . Each actuator 40 has a linear voltage differential transformer LVDT 60 connected with it to measure the local delivery height 5 of the nozzle 30 . The torque motor 110 is controlled by an error signal dependent on the difference between an input signal 136 representing a desired height and a signal 132 from the LVDT represent ing actual height. In a paper making machine the actuators 40 may be controlled by a computer 150 that determines a nozzle profile 5 in dependence upon a grammage profile measurement made on the paper web 174 . The hydraulic fluid for a paper making machine is preferably water based to minimise contamination if leakage occurs.
