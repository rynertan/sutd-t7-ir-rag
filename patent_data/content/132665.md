# Individual identification apparatus.

## Abstract
Four fingers of a hand of an individual person, i.e. the index finger, the middle finger, the medical finger and the little finger are placed on a transparent measuring table 11 in juxtaposition. A guide member 12 is also placed on the table to restrict the position of the hand 1 and light is irradiated onto the table. The intensity of the light passed through the transparent measuring table is scanned by a television cam era 15 at every light receiving point to convert it in electrical signals. Thus obtained electric signals are processed to calcu late the differential data of the finger lengths thereby detect ing an individual person.
