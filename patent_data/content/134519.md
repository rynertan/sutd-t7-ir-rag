# Thermoplastic resin composition.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic resin composition comprising A from 10 to 90 parts by weight of an imide modified polymer having an imido group and obtained by reacting ammonia and or a primary amine to a copolymer prepared by the polymerization of a monomer mixture comprising from 50 to 70 by weight of an aromatic vinyl monomer and from 30 to 50 by weight of an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride B from 10 to to 90 parts by weight of a graft copolymer prepared by copolymerizing from 30 to 75 by weight of a mixture comprising from 40 to 80 by weight of a rubber like polymer having a weight average particle size of from 0.3 to 0.6 µm and from 20 to 60 by weight of a rubber like polymer having a weight average particle size of from 0.1 to 0.2 µm, with from 25 to 70 by weight of a monomer mixture comprising from 55 to 75 by weight of an aromatic vinyl monomer and from 25 to 45 by weight of a vinyl cyanide monomer, said rubber like polymer being a buta diene polymer or a butadiene copolymer containing at least 50 by weight of butadiene and C from 0 to 80 parts by weight of a copolymer prepared by polymerizing from 40 to 80 by weight of an aromatic vinyl monomer, from 0 to 40 by weight of a vinyl cyanide monomer and from 0 to 40 by weight of a vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith.
