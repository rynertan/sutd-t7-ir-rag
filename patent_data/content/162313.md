## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF RUBBER REINFORCING POLYESTER CORD The present invention relates to a process for the production of a rubber reinforcing polyester cord. More particularly, it relates to a process for the production of a rubber reinforcing polyester cord having excellent chemical stability which is useful as a reinforcing material for tires and belts, particularly as a carcass material for light truck tire. Prior Art It is known that polyester high tenacity yarns are an organic fiber having well balanced properties and are useful as an industrial material for various utilities, particularly polyethylene terephthalate tire cord is useful, for instance, as a carcass material for automobile tires. However, the conventional polyethylene terephthalate cord is inferior in the chemical stability at high temperature, and hence, it is considered to be not suitable as a reinforcing material for some utilities which require high chemical stability when it is contained in rubber at high temperature, for instance, as a reinforcing material for truck tire, bus tire or bias light truck tire which has a large size, though it is advantageous in a lower cost than other materials and also in the excellent initial modulus and tenacity. In this viewpoint, nylon cord has mainly been used for bias tires such as light truck tires. With recent development of motorization, users request more severe conditions for tires, and hence, the conventional tires are not satisfactory for such severe requirements. For instance, in case of bias light truck tire, improved steering stability, less noise and improved flat spotting properties are required. For satisfying these requirements, it is effective to improve the modulus of the tire cord material, and it is desired to use a polyester cord instead of a nylon cord. In order to use the polyester cord, it is essential to improve the chemical stability at high temperature when contained in rubber. That is, in case of bias tire having a size larger than that of light truck tire, the inner temperature of the tire occasionally increases to 1400C or higher during running to by its own heat build up.In such a case, the conventional polyester tire cord rapidly loses its tenacity of fiber because of depolymerization reaction of the cord by an amine or moisture which are contained in the rubber. Thus, it is essential to eliminate these drawbacks in order to use the polyester cord for tires of large automobiles. It has been well known that the chemical stability of the tire cord in rubber is an important problem for polyester fibers. It was proposed to improve the chemical stability by decreasing the carboxyl end groups in the polyester fibers to less than 15 equivalents 106 g by W. W.Daniels et al. cf. U.S. Patent No. 3,051,212 . There have been given various proposals for decreasing of the carboxyl end groups of polyester fibers cf. U.S. Patent 3,975,329, and Japanese Patent First Publication No. 116816 1980 .However, the chemical stability of polyester fibers within tires is not necessarily sufficiently improved by the mere decrease of carboxyl end groups. It will be clear from the fact that polyester fibers have never been used for light truck bias tires having a comparatively large size. This insufficient improvement of chemical stability in rubber by lowering of the carboxyl end group is also clear in view of the mechanism of degradation of polyester. That is, the degadation of polyester within rubber proceeds by hydrolysis and the carboxyl end group functions merely as an acidic catalyst, and on the other hand, rubber includes various amines as a vulcanization accelerator or an antioxidant and the amine additives are diffused within the polyester and act as a basic catalyst for the hydrolysis of polyester.It is well known that an basic catalyst shows a higher activity than an acidic catalyst in the hydrolysis of polyester.Accordingly, it is well understood that it is not so effective to decrease the amount of carboxyl end groups for the purpose of improving the chemical stability of polyester fiber within rubber from the above reaction mechanism. It has also been tried to prevent the undesirable deterioration of polyester at high hemperature by depressing the reaction with amines or moisture within rubber by means of incorporating an amine scavenger as isocyanate compounds or a hygroscopic agent such as calcium oxide to the surface of the polyester fibers or within the rubber to be reinforced around the periphery of fibers. However, these means are not only ineffective for substantial improvement of the chemical stability of the polyester per se but also disadvantageous in deterioration of other properties of polyester fibers and also in bad effect to processing of rubber. Accordingly, such means have never been used industrially. Thus, there has hitherto been studied on improvement of chemical stability of polyester fibers in rubber, but any good method has never been found until now. Demand for polyester fibers having imporved chemical stability in rubber is more increased as mentioned above. Object of Invention Under the circumstances, the present inventors have intensively studied on the improvement of chemical stability of polyester fibers in rubber and have found the following facts. The deterioration of polyester in rubber is caused by hydrolysis due to the presence of an amine catalyst, wherein the amine catalyst is amines derived from the additives such as vulcanization accelerators and antioxidants contained in the rubber which are diffused within the polyester fibers. Since amines have high polarity and are not easily diffused within the non polar polyester fibers in comparison with water molecule, the diffusion of amines into polyester can sufficiently be prevented by increasing in some extent the restraint of molecular chain in amorphous region of polyester and thereby lowering the mobility of molecular chain, and as the result, the undesirable deterioration of polyester in rubber can significantly be inhibited. Based on the above finding of deterioration mechanisms of polyester fibers, the present inventors have further studied on the molecular mobility of polyester fibers and on various conditons for the production of polyester fibers and for the steps of after treatment thereof. As a result, it has been found that the mobility of amorphous molecular chain of polyester cord as the rubber reinforcing material is effected by the heat treatment in the dipping process in step of treating with an adhesive and that the main factor is temperature among various conditions in the heat treatment. The chemical stability in rubber of yarns which are treated at such a low temperature as lower than 2200C in the dipping process is compared with that of yarns which are treated at a temperature 230 2400C in the conventional dipping process. As a result, the latter shows a tenacity retention of only 35 , but on the other hand, the fornier shows surprisingly that of 75 . Nevertheless, when yarns are spun at a conventional spinning speed and the resulting undrawn polyester fibers having a high intrinsic viscosity are drawn at a high draw ratio and are treated at such a low temperature in dipping process, the high tenacity polyester fibers thus obtained have high thermal shrinkage and hence are not suitable as a rubber reinforcing fiber. The temperature in the conventional dipping process for polyester fibers is usually in the range of 230 to 2500C actual temperature .This is owing to necessity of high temperature in order to exhibit excellent adhesion of a diffusion dipping agent such as Vulcabond g manufactured by Vulnax . The dipping treatment gives also another important function, i.e. improvement of thermal dimensional stability of the fiber. The present inventors have further intensively studied on the conditions for the production of polyester fibers without deterioration of the thermal dimensional stability, and have found that the most suitable material is a high tenacity fiber obtained by drawing a partially oriented polyethylene terephthalate yarn hereinarter, referred to as POY , which is occasionally called as a highly oriented, amorphous fiber which has a high intrinsic viscosity. It is confirmed that when a high tenacity polyester fiber obtained from POY is subjected to dipping at a low temperature of lower than 2200C, the fiber shows unexpectedly improved chemical stability in rubber while keeping the excellent thermal dimensional stability. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for the production of a rubber reinforcing polyester cord having improved chemical stability.Another object of the invention is to provide a rubberreinforcing polyester cord having improved chemical stability without deteriorating the excellent thermal dimensional stability which is particularly useful as a reinforcing material for tires, belts, etc., particularly as a carcass material òf light truck tires. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to persons skilled in the art from the following description. Detailed Description of Invention The process of the production of a rubberreinforcing polyester cord of the present invention comprises melt spinning a polyester comprising predominantly polyethylene terephthalate and having an intrinsic viscosity of not less than 0.75, taking up the resulting spun yarns under cooling to obtain solid yarns, wherein filaments have a birefringence of 0.010 to 0.050, drawing the solid yarns at a draw ratio of 2.0 to 4.0 times, twisting the drawn yarns at a rate of 5 times or more per 10 cm to obtain a cord, applying thereto an adhesive for a rubber, and then heat treating at a temperature of not higher than 2200C. In one embodiment of the invention, the process comprises melt spinning a polyester comprising predominantly polyethylene terephthalate and having an intrinsic viscosity of not less than 0.75, taking up the resulting spun yarns under cooling to obtain solid yarns, wherein filaments have a birefringence of 0.020 to 0.050, drawing the solid yarns at a draw ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 times, twisting the drawn yarns at 5 turns or more per 10 cm to obtain a cord, applying thereto an adhesive for a rubber, and then heat treating at a temperature of not higher than 2200C. In order to obtain the desired cord havingsexcel lent toughness as well as improved chemical stability, the solid yarns obtained by taking up of the spun yarns are composed of filaments having preferably a lower birefringence such as 0.010 to 0.020. That is, in the preferred embodiment of the invention, the process comprises meltspinning a polyester comprising predominantly polyethylene terephthalate and having an intrinsic viscosity of not less than 0.75, taking up the resulting spun yarns under cooling to obtain solid yarns, wherein filaments have a birefringence of 0.010 to 0.020, drawing the solid yarns at a draw ratio of 2.9 to 4.0 times, twisting the drawn yarns at a rate of 5 turns or more per 10 cm to obtain a cord, applying thereto an adhesive for a rubber, and then heat treating at a temperature of not higher than 2200C, more preferably not higher than 2100C. The polyester fiber used in the present invention is used for reinforcing rubbers, and hence, in order to obtain excellent fatigue resistance and high tenacity, the starting polyester comprises predominantly polyethylene terephthalate i.e. at least 95 mole of ethylene terephthalate units and has an intrinsic viscosity of not less than 0.75 which is measured in phenol tetrachloroethane 6 4, at 300C . The polyester is extruded through a spinneret at a molten state, and then, the spun yarns are taking up under cooling to obtain solid yarns, wherein the filaments have a birefringence of 0.010 to 0.050. For this purpose, the spun yarns are taken up at a take up speed where the filament stress at a solidification point is in the range of 1.5 x 107 dyne cm2 to 7.5 x 107 dyne cm2, preferably 2.0 x 107 dyne cm2 to 5.0 x 107 dyne cm2. In this step, the spun yarns are preferably cooled with a cooling air having a comparatively high temperature e.g. 50 to 600C . The solid yarns thus obtained are drawn at a draw ratio of 2,0 to 4.0, by which the yarns have a tenacity of not less than 7.5 g d. The solid yarns are subjected to the drawing after wound up or without winding up. The polyester yarns thus obtained have a high tenacity and excellent thermal dimensional stability. The yarns may optionally be treated with an epoxy compound containing two or more epoxy groups or an isocyanate compound in order to give them surface activity, during the spinning and drawing steps or after the drawing step, by which the yarns show improved adhesion to rubbers. In order to obtain a polyester cord having more excellent toughness, the taking up of the spun yarns under cooling is carried out so that the solid filaments have a birefringence of 0.010 to 0.020, and the solid yarns are drawn at a draw ratio of 2. 9 to 4.0 in the same manner as described above, by which the yarns have a tenacity of not less than 8.5 g d. The polyester spun yarns are twisted at a rate of 5 turns or more per 10 cm to obtain a cord in order to make easy to handle in the subsequent steps and also to improve the fatigue resistance, in which state it is used as a rubber reinforcing material. The twist rate may vary according to the desired utilities. The cord thus obtained is subjected to a dipping treatment in order to give it adhesion to rubbers. The dipping treatment is carried out by dipping the cord in a dipping solution in one or more steps. The dipping solution includes A an aqueous dispersion of an epoxy resin, B an aqueous dispersion of a block isocyanate, C an aqueous solution of a carrier for the polyester fibers, and D a mixture of a resorcinol formaldehyde resin and a rubber latex. These may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. In order to give the cord higher adhesion to rubbers, the dipping solution contains preferably at least partially the aqueous dispersion of an epoxy resin A . The epoxy resin of the liquid A includes reaction products of an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol e.g.glycerin, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, hexane triol, sorbitol, trimethylolpropane, 3 methylpentanetriol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, etc. and a halohydrin e.g. epichlorohydrin, etc. reaction products of an aromatic polyhydric alcohol e.g. resorcinol, catechol, hydroquinone, 1,3,5 trihydroxybenzene, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl dimethylmethane, 4,4 bi hydroxyphenyl, etc. and a halohydrin e.g. epichlorohydrin, etc. reaction products of a phenolic novolak resin e.g.phenolic novolak resin, cresolic novolak resin, resorcinolic novolak resin, etc. and a halohydrin e.g. epichlorohydrin, etc. epoxy compounds which unsaturated bonds are oxidized by a peracetic acid e.g. diglycidyl ether, vinylcyclohexene diepoxide, 3,4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexylmethyl 3 ,4 61 methylcyclohexenecarboxylate, etc. etc. The blocked isocyanate compound for the liquid B includes reaction products obtained by reacting one or more of polyisocyanate compounds and one or more of isocyanate blocking agents. The polyisocyante compounds include diisocyanates, such as tolylene diisocyanate, bitolylene diisocyanate, dianisidine diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, m phenylene diisocyanate, m xylylene diisocyanate, alkylbenzene diisocyanates, l chlorobenzene 2 , 4 diisocyanate, cyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, 3,3 dimethoxydiphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate, l nitrobenzene 2, diisocyante, l alkoxybenzene 2,4 diisocyanates, ethylene diisocyanate, propylene diisocyante, cyclohexylene 1,2 diisocyante, 3,3 dichloro 4,4 biphenylenediisocyanate, diphenylene diisocyanate, 2 chlorotrimethylene diisocyanate, butylene 1,2diisocyanate, ethylidene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate, diphenylethane diisocyanate, 1,5 naphthalene diisocyanate, cyclohexane diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, etc. triisocyantes, such as triphenylmethane triisocyanate, diphenylmethane triisocyanate, butane 1,2,2triisocyanate, trimethylolpropanetolylene diisocyanate trimer, 2,4,4 diphenyl ether triisocyanate, etc. polyfunctional isocyanates, such as polymethylenepolyphenyl isocyanates which are a mixture of compounds of the formula EMI12.1 wherein n is an integer of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The isocyanate blocking agents include phenols e.g. phenol, thiophenol, cresol, resorcinol , tertiary alcohols e.g. t butanol, t pentanol, t butanethiol, etc. , aromatic amines e.g. diphenylamine, diphenylnaphthylamine, xylidine, etc. , imines e.g. ethyleneimine, propyleneimine, etc. , imides e.g. succinic imide, phthalic imide, etc. , active methylene compounds e.g. acetacetic esters, acetylacetone, malonic diesters, etc. , mercaptanes e.g. 2mercaptobenzothiazole, t dodecylmercaptane, etc. , lactames e.g.E caprolactame, valerolactame, butyrolactame, propiolactame, etc. , ureas e.g. urea, diethyleneurea, thiourea, etc. , oximes e.g. acetoxime, cyclohexanone oxime, benzophenone oxime, methyl ethyl ketone oxime, etc. , diaryl compounds e.g. carbazole, phenolnaphthylamine, Nphenylxylidine, etc. , bisulfites, borates, o pyrrolidone, and the like. These are used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. Suitable examples of the carriers for the liquid C are benzoic acid and derivatives thereof e.g. benzoic acid, methyl benzoate, propyl benzoate, m nitrobenzoic acid, etc. , salicylic acid and derivatives thereof e.g.salicylic acid, methyl salicylate, phenyl p bromosalicylate, etc. , phthalic acid and derivatives thereof e.g. phthalic acid, ethyl phthalate, etc. , phenol derivatives e.g.acetophenone, propiophenone, p chlorophenol, p nitrophenol, o phenylphenol, 2,4,6 tribromophenol, m cresole, resorcinol, etc. , aromatic ethers e.g. anisole, p bromoanisole, etc. , halogenobenzenes e.g. monochlorobenzene, p dichlorobenzene, 1,3,5 trichlorobenzene, p dibromobenzene, etc. , naphthalene derivatives e.g. methylnaphthalene, bromonaphthalene, etc. , di and triphenylmethane derivatives e.g. diphenyldichloromethane, triphenol chloromethane, triphenylcarbinol, etc.3, diphenyl derivatives e.g. 4,41 dihydroxydiphenyl, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl, etc. , tricresyl phosphate, allyl 3 hydroxyphenyl ether and a polymer thereof, reaction products of resorcinol, p chlorophenol and formaldehyde of the formula EMI13.1 wherein m and n are 0 or a positive integer, and m is 1 in average, and n is 1 in average, and resorcinol derivatives of the formula EMI13.2 wherein m and n are 0 or a positive integer, and X is CH2 , O , or Sg , group, where Q is 1 or 2. These carriers diffuse within the polyester fibers at a high temperature to exhibit the adhesion or adhesionaiding effects, and hence, they are also called as a diffusible adhesive. The liquid D is usually called as RFL and is an aqueous mixture of a precondensate obtained by reaction of resorcinol and formalin in the presence of an acidic or alkaline catalyst and one or more latexes selected from styrene butadiene copolymer latex, carboxyl group containing styrene butadiene copolymer latex, styrene butadienevinylpyridine terpolymer latex, acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer latex, polychloroprene latex, polybutadiene latex, natural rubber latex, and the like. In the present invention, it is the most important to regulate the heat treatment temperature in the dipping process. The present inventors have found that in case of using a polyester fiber comprising predominantly polyethylene terephthalate as the rubber composite, the mobility of the amorphous molecular chain and futher the chemical stability in rubber are mainly affected by the temperature in the adhesive treating i.e. dipping process.The temperature in the heat treatment should be not higher than 2200C, preferably in the range of 1700C to 2100C. This importance of the heat treating temperature is explained in more detail referring to the accompanying Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows the relation between the heattreating temperature and the retained strength, wherein the polyester cords were subjected to the dipping treatment at a temperature as shown in the figure and then were embedded in rubber, which were heated at 1700C for 3 hours, and the retained strength of the cords after heat treatment in rubber were measured at room temperature. The retained strength is plotted at each heat treating temperature inFig. 1. As is clear from the figure, the heat treating temperature gives much effect on the chemical stability of the polyester in rubber.According to the knowledge of the present inventors, the deterioration of polyesters in rubber is largely affected by the compositions of rubber, particularly by the kinds and amounts of amines contained in the rubber, and in case of the conventional rubber compositions, the conventional polyester cords show usually a retained strength of 20 to 40 when the rubber composite is heated at 170 C for 3 hours. In this viewpoint, the polyester cord of the present invention shows surprisingly higher retained strength. Besides, as is mentioned above, when the high tenacity yarns made from undrawn yarns having a birefringence of 0.010 to 0.020 i.e. medium oriented yarns are used, the polyester cord has more improved toughness as well as excellent chemical stability with keeping the thermal shrinkage at the usual level. Thus, the rubber reinforcing polyester cord of the present invention has excellent chemical stability, excellent tenacity and further excellent toughness with keeping the thermal dimensional stability and thermal shrinkage, and is useful as a tire cord for various automobiles, particularly for large size tires sich as light truck tires. The present invention is illustrated by the following Examples, but should not be construed to be limited thereto. Example 1 Polyethylene terephthalate intrinsic viscosity 1.0, diethylene glycol content 1.0 by mole, carboxyl group content 10 equivalents 106 g is melt spun and drawn under the four conditions, A, B, C and D as shown in Table 1. As is clear from the average birefringence of the spun yarns, in case of A, B and C, POY highly oriented, amorphous yarns are spun and drawn, and in case of D, conventional undrawn yarns almost non oriented amorphous yarns are drawn, which is out of the claim in the present invention. The drawn yarns thus obtained 1000 D denier are each twisted at a rate of 49 x 49 per 10 cm to give two folded yarn cords. The cords are each treated with Ri L liquid which contains a reaction product of resorcinol, p chlorophenol and formaldehyde Vulcabond E, manufactured by Vulnax . The compositions of the dipping solution are shown in Table 2, and the treating conditions are shown inTable 3. The heat treating temperature is varied stepwise in each cord. The properties of the cords, yarn characteristics after recovered from twisting, and deterioration test in rubber are shown in Table 3.

T alpha means an absorption peak temperature of amorphous region in the temperature distribution of dynamic loss tangent tan which was measured at 110 Hz. The absorption peak temperature at amorphous region T appeared in the temperature distribution of tan is used as a parameter which is correlative to the mobility of molecular chain in amorphous region. The accompanying Fig. 2 shows the relation between TA and heat treating temperature of yarn A and yarn D. Both yarns are different in the fine structure owing to the difference of the process for the production thereof, and hence, the difference of mobility of the amorphous molecular chain can not directly be evaluated merely by the Tx. However, at least as to the same sample, T can be used as a measure for evaluation of effect of heat treatment on the molibity of amorphous molecular chain. It is clear fromFig. 2 that when the heat treating temperature is above 220OC, Tz loweres rapidly, and hence, the mobility of amorphous molecular chain is well correlative to chemical stability of polyester in rubber. The increase of the mobility of amorphous molecular chain by the heat treatment will be explained as follows. The heat treatment causes the perfection of crystalline i.e. perfection of crystalline structure and increase of crystalline size and thereby incomplete structure being accumulated within the amorphous region. As is clear from Table 3, in both of the polyester fiber obtained by drawing of POY A, B or C and the polyester fiber obtained by drawing of the almost non oriented undrawn yarn D, the mobility of the amorphous molecular chain is increased and the chemical stability in rubber is significantly lowered, when the dipping temperature is above 2200C. Besides, the yarn A and yarn B are prepared by the method by the present inventors wherein the molten filaments are cooled with a hot quenching air so that the difference of molecular orientation at the inner and outer layer of each filament is decreased cf. Japanese Patent FirstPublication No. 98419 1983 . These yarn A and yarn B show more improved properties when subjected to the dipping at a low temperature in comparison with the yarn C which is not quenched under such conditions as above. Moreover, in case of yarn D which is obtained by drawing of almost non oriented amorphous undrawn yarn, when it is subjected to the dipping at a heat treating temperature of not higher than 2200C like in the other yarns, it shows improved chemical stability, but shows simultaneously high heat shrinkage, and hence, when it is incorporated into the rubber composite, the cord shrinks to induce shrinkage of the rubber composite. Accordingly, such a cord is not suitable for rubber reinforcing material. Example 2 The same yarn A and yarn D as used in Example 1 are twisted at a rate of 49 x 49 per 10 cm to obtain two folded yarn cord in the same manner as described in Example 1. The yarn is subjected to dipping treatment under the conditions as shown in Table 4, wherein the first dipping solution in the first zone is an aqueous dispersion of a 2 by weight of an epoxy resin Denacol EX 313, manufactured by Nagase Sangyo K.K., Japan, which is a reaction product of glycerin and epichlorohydrin which is incorporated with 0.2 by weight of sodium do ecylsulfosuccinate, and the second dripping solution in the second zone is a RFL solution which is prepared by adding resorcinol 5.7 parts by weight , 37 aqueous formalin 6.3 parts by weight and 10 aqueous sodium hydroxide 3 parts by weight to water 185.7 parts by weight , maturing the mixture at 250C for 6 hours, and adding thereto Nipol 2518 F A manufactured Thy Nippon Zeon K.X., Japan, which is a butadiene styrenevinylpyridine terpolymer latex, solid content 41 175.7 parts by weight and water 23.6 parts by weight .The properties of the dipped cords, properties of the yarns after untwisting, and the strength retention after deterioration in rubber at 1700C are shown in Table 4.

By the way, generally speaking, when the stretching rate in the dipping step is higher, the chemical stability in rubber is higher. However, in the above examples, no significant effect is obtained in the stretching rate. As to the heat treatment, no significant effect is obtained either.These results mean that among the three conditions in the dipping process temperature, time and tension, only the heat treating temperature in the dipping process rules mainly the mobility of amorphous molecular chain and the chemical stability in rubber. Example 3 Polyethylene terephthalate intrinsic viscosity 1.0, diethylene glycol conten 1.0 by mole, carboxy1 group content 10 equivalents 106 g is melt spun and drawn under the four conditions, A, B, C and D as shown in Table 5. As is clear from the average birefringence of the spun yarns, in case of A and B, MOY medium oriented, amorphous yarns are spun and drawn, in case of C, POY highly oriented, amorphous yarns are used, and in case of D, conventional undrawn yarns are used. D is a reference example. The drawn yarns thus obtained 1000 D are each twisted at a rate of 49 x 49 per 10 cm to give two folded yarn cords. The cords are each treated with RFL solution which contains a reaction product of resorcinol, p chlorophenol and formaldehyde Vulcabond E, manufactured byVulnax . The compositions of the treating liquid are shown in Table 6, and the treating conditions are shown in Table 7. The heat treating temperature is varied stepwlse in each cord.

As is clear from Table 7, in all of the polyester fiber obtained by drawing of MOY A or B, the polyester fiber obtained by drawing of POY C and the polyester fiber obtained by drawing of the almost non oriented undrawn yarnD, the chemical stability in rubber is significantly lowered, when the dripping temperature is above 2200C. Besides, as to the improvement of toughness, when the polyester fiber C obtained by drawing POY is heat treated at 2200C, the treated cord No. 7 shows similar toughness to that of the cord No. 11 which was treated under conventional conditions, but the treatea cords Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 6 obtained by drawing the MOY yarn A and yarn B show more improved toughness. Moreover, in case of yarn D which is obtained by drawing of almost non oriented amorphous undrawn yarn, when it is subjected to the dipping at a heat treating temperature of not higher than 2200C like in the other yarns, it shows improved chemical stability, but shows simultaneously high heat shrinkage, and hence, when it is incorporated into the rubber composite, the cord shrinks to induce shrinkage of the rubber composite. Accordingly, such a cord is not suitable for a rubber reinforcing material. The cords obtained from the polyester MOY fiber yarns A and B show somewhat higher heat shrinkage than that of the cord obtained from polyester POY fiber yarn C , but show significantly lower heat shrinkage than that of the conventional yarn yarn D , and hence, are enough useful. Example 4 The same yarn A and yarn D as used in Example 3 are twisted at a rate of 49 x 49 per 10 cm to obtain two folded yarn cord in the same manner as described in Example 3. The yarn is subjected to dipping treatment under the conditions as shown in Table 8, wherein the first dipping solution in the first zone is an aqueous dispersion of a 2 by weight of an epoxy resin Denacol EX 313, manufactured by Nagase Sangyo K.K., Japan, which is a reaction product of glycerin and epichlorohydrin which is incorporated with 0.2 by weight of sodium dodecylsulfosuccinate, and the second dipping solution in the second zone is a RFL solution which is prepared by adding resorcinol 5.7 parts by weight , 37 aqueous formalin 6.3 parts by weight and 10 aqueous sodium hydroxide 3 parts by weight to water 185.7 parts by weight , maturing the mixture at 250C for 6 hours, and adding thereto Nipol 2518 F A manufactured by Nippon Zeon K.K., Japan, which is a butadiene styrenevinylpyridine terpolymer latex, solid content 41 175.7 parts by weight and water 23.6 parts by weight . The characteristics of the dipped cords and the strength retention after deterioration in rubber at 1700C are shown in Table 8.

Moreover, the polyester cord of the present invention shows improved toughness. Accordingly, it has ideal characteristics as a rubberreinforcing polyester fiber. By the way, generally speaking, when the stretching ratio in the dipping process is higher, the chemical stability in rubber is higher. However, in the above examples, no significant effect is obtained in the stretching ratio. As to the heat treatment, no significant effect is obtained either.
