# Metallized films and method of producing them.

## Abstract
The invention provides a multiple layer metallised film comprising a substrate layer of a polymer or copolymer of an alpha olefin, the molecule of which contains from 2 to 6 car bon atoms, having on at least one surface thereof an adher ent layer comprising a random copolymer of ethylene with from 0.5 to 15 wt of a 3 to 6 carbon alpha mono olefin, and a metallic layer on the surface of the adherent layer remote from the substrate. Improved adhesion between the metal lised and substrate layers is thereby achieved, and the multi layer film is suitable for packaging a variety of edible pro ducts.
