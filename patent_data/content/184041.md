## Description
6 METHYLENE MORPHINAN PURIFICATION TECHNIQUE The present invention is directed to a purification recovery technique in the synthesis of 17 cyclobutylmethyl 3 hydroxy 8B methyl 6 methylene morphinane. Said compound is a 6 methylene morphinan derivative exhibiting analgesic narcotic antagonist properties. DESCRIPTION OF PERTINENT ART 17 cyclobutylmethyl 3 hydroxy 86 methyl 6 methylene morphinane hereinafter alternatively referred to as TR 5379 is disclosed and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 4,259,329 issued March 31, 1981 to Kotick, et al. As described therein, said compound is prepared by the reaction of methylenetriphenylphosphorane with 17 cyclobutylmethyl 3 methoxy 8B methyl morphinan 6 one in a suitable inert solvent under an inert atmosphere. Purification of the resulting compound i.e., TR 5379 is subsequently achieved by column chromatography using Silica Gel G. However, this purification technique suffers from the disadvantage of being impractical for large scale production of said compound due to the large quantities of Silica GelG and large volumes of organic solvents necessary to conduct said purification.The method described herein teaches a procedure whereby column chromatography is eliminated as a means of recoveringTR 5379 thereby lessening the time spent for isolation and purification of said compound as well as providing a method for the purification of large quantities of TR 5379. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention discloses a method for recovering the compound 17 cyclobutylmethyl 3hydroxy 8B methyl 6 methylene morphinane i.e.,TR 5379 from an inert organic solvent extract which contains said compound. The method includes the steps of a adding said inert organic solvent extract to a dilute hydrochloric acid solution thereby forming a crystalline, insoluble hydrochloride salt of said compound b isolating said insoluble hydrochloride salt c adding said in soluble hydrochloride salt to an alkaline aqueous medium thereby converting said salt to said compound and d extracting said compound from said medium by contacting said medium with an organic solvent and recovering therefrom said compound. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following nonlimiting example describes the general preparation of TR 5379 and the recovery procedure of the present invention. A solution of methylenetriphenylphosphorane was prepared from sodium hydride 0.66 mole and methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide 237.4 grams in 900 milliliters ml of dimethylsulfoxide under an argon atmosphere. To this was added a solution of 75 grams g of 17 cyclobutylmethyl 3 hydroxy8B methyl morphinane 6 one in 350 ml of dimethylsulfoxide. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 800 C for three hours and allowed to cool. The cooled mixture was diluted with ice and concentrated ammonium hydroxide and extracted three times with approximately 1 liter portions of toluene. The toluene extracts were combined and washed four times with about 500 ml portions of water, dried and subsequently added dropwise to a 5 by weight hydrochloric acid solution.The resulting insoluble hydrochloride salt was filtered, washed several times with toluene, and then re slurried in about 500 ml of fresh toluene. The solid was again isolated by filtration and subsequently suspended in about 500 ml of water pH adjusted to about 10 11 with concentrated ammonium hydroxide and the mixture extracted three times with about 500 ml portions of a mixture of ether toluene 1 1 . The combined organic extracts were washed four times with about 500 ml portions of water, dried and evaporated to give 65 g of the desired 17 cyclobutylmethyl 3 hydroxy 8ss methyl 6 methylene morphinane as a tan foam. IR and NMR spectral characteristics compared favorably to an authentic sample prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,259,329. By way of example, the technique of the instant invention was illustrated with the compoundTR 5379. However, the skilled artisan will readily discern that this technique may have applicability in the preparation of other 6 methylene morphinan compounds. Accordingly, contemplated equivalent compounds to which the purification recovery techniques of the present invention may be applied include those compounds disclosed by Kotick et al in U.S. Patent No. 4,259,329.
