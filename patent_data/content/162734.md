# Laser surveying equipment.

## Abstract
A laser surveying equipment is disclosed. It includes a laser beam luminous section a suspending reflection mem ber suspended in such a manner as to reflect laser beam radiated from the laser beam luminous section upward and always to direct optical axis of such reflected light in the perpendicular direction and a projection lens system adapted to project the laser beam after forming it into a gen erally parallel flux of light. It may also include a rotary re flection member rotatably arranged in order to displace by approximately 90 degrees an optical path of parallel flux of light obtained from the projection lens system and to scan the parallel flux of light toward a surveying object within a horizontal plane.
