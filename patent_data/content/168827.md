# Data processing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A calculation processing system characterized by com prising the step of decomposing a program into tuples, func tions and variables, the step of abstracting the decomposed program thereby to transform it into a combinator graph, the step of assigning the program in the combinator graph to a plurality of process units, and the step of executing the as signed program through reductions.
