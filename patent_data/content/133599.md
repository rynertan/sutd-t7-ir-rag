# VACCINES AND COMPOSITIONS AGAINST HEPATITIS B VIRAL INFECTIONS

## Abstract
Anti HBe based vaccines and pharmaceutically accept able compositions for treating patients against hepatitis B viral infections. The vaccines and compositions are characte rized by a component that elicits in a treated patient the formation of anti HBe at a titer effective to protect the patient for some period of time against hepatitis B viral infection or at a titer effective to lessen the severity of a hepatitis B viral infection in that patient.
