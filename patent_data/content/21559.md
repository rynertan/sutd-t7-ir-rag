# A reclining chair mechanism.

## Abstract
A recliner linkage assembly includes a four bar linkage system 20, 30 32 for serving the dual function of a supporting as an rest frame 15 from a pair of hanger links 44, 45 for generally linear translatory movement during movement between upright and reclined positions, and b supporting a chair seat frame 13 and back rest frame 14 for generally pivotal translatory movement between upright and reclined positions. The frames 13 15 are so connected to the four bar linkage that only a minimal forward starting effort on the arm rest frame 15 relative the ground is required to initiate movement from an upright toward a reclined position, after which the weight of the person in the chair causes the movement to be continued until the chair arrives at an intermediate recline and further to a full recline. Return movement is by the seated person leaning forward.
