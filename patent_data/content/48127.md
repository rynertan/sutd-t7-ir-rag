# Crop harvester with header height control.

## Abstract
The header of a harvester is raised and lowered by a hydraulic cylinder controlled by solenoid valves when a raise circuit 170 or a lower circuit 172 is energised, in order to maintain a predetermined ground clearance. The header carries a rotary switch 72 in a sealed housing 74 with a wiper arm 80 having an integral bush 126 extending in sealed manner out of the housing and keyed by a pin 140 on to a transverse shah 58 carrying one or more ground engaging feelers. The wiper arm moves a make before break brush across a row of contacts 98 to bridge these selective ly to a common contact 100 . A manually operable selector switch 182, 184, 186 has an off position in which the raise and lower circuits cannot be energised and three further positions each corresponding to a predetermined range of header to ground clearance. In each such further position a first group of the contacts 98 consisting of at least one end contact 108 is connected to the raise circuit 170 and a second group of contacts comprising at least the other end contact 110 is connected to the lower circuit 172 . One of the intervening contacts 102, 104, 106 is not included in either group so as to establish a dead band and the dead contact is selected by the position of the manual selector switch to select the clearance height range. The end contacts 108 and 110 are of greater arcuate extent than the intervening contacts and allow the housing 74 to be adjusted on the header about the axis of the shaft 58 for joint adjustment of the clearance height ranges. Connections to the contacts 98 and 100 are by way of an external plug connector so that the sealing of the housing 74 is main tained. The switch 72 can accordingly withstand the harsh environment of a harvester header.
