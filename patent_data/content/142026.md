# METHOD FOR CONSTRUCTING MICROLENS ENDS FOR OPTICAL FIBRES, PARTICULARLY FOR BIOMEDICAL AND OR SURGICAL USE, AND DEVICE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE METHOD

## Abstract
The method for constructing microlens ends for optical fibres, particularly for biomedical and or surgical use, is characterised by propagating in the optical fibre a radiation of the type used during the application of the fibre itself, and to which said fibre is transparent, and converting the wave length of the radiation, outside to the fibre and in proximity to its output end, which has been previously cut along a plane orthogonal to its axis, into a band of wavelengths which can be absorbed by the fibre, for a time sufficient to cause local ised fusion of the end. In order to implement this method, the invention also provides for the use of a device comprising a block of material which converts radiation and is provided with a flat surface, a support which keeps the fibre orthogonal to said flat surface and with its previously cut end facing said flat surface, and means for varying in a controlled manner, preferably by mic rometric regulation, the distance between the fibre end and the said flat surface of the block of material.
