# Method and apparatus for filling sodium into sodium sulphur cells.

## Abstract
An improved method of and apparatus for filling sodium into the sodium reservoir of a sodium sulphur cell, which facilitates automatic filling of a large number of cells in rapid succession, makes use of a cell 10 in which the sodium reservoir has an open ended metal filler tube 12 . The cell is heated to a temperature such that sodium will remain liquid, the tube 12 is sealed within an outlet of the filling machine by an inflatable seal 42 , the reservoir is evacuated of air, flushed with an inert gas and then evacuated for vacuum filling with a metered quantity of sodium through a sodium feed tube 36 which extends down into the filler tube 12 . The sodium is pressurised using an inert gas to force the sodium into the cell, the gas is evacuated and, after withdrawal of the feed tube 36 , the filling tube 12 is sealed by pinching and welding.
