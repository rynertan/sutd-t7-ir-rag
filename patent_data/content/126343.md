## Description
TREATMENT OF DIARRHOEA The present invention relates to the treatment of diarrhoea using a class of pentacyclic compounds and to pharmaceutical formulations for use in such treatment. Compounds set out below are useful in treatmentCNS disorders such as depression and anxiety. It has now suprisingly been found that these compounds are also useful in proto ting young animals from death due to neonatal scours and in the treatment of scours and diarrhoea. Accordingly the present invention provides a method for treating or preventing diarrhoea or scours which comprises administering to a human or non human animal in need thereof an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I EMI1.1 wherein i P is a bond, oxygen, sulphur, NR4, methylene, ethylene or vinylene and X isEMI2.1 and R1 and R2 are each hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, acyloxy, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or trifluoromethyl and R3 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower aralkyl aminoethyl or aminopropyl each optionally N substituted by lower alkyl, or lower alkyl substituted nitrogen containing heterocyclyl.and R4 is lower alkyl, and R5 is hydrogen, or ii P is CR6R7 and X isEMI2.2 wherein the nitrogen is bonded to P.and R1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, halogen or trifluoromethyl, and R3 is hydrogen, lower or higher alkyl, lower alkenyl or lower alkynyl, C37 cycloalkyl, C37 cycloalkenyl or lower alkyl substituted by C37 cycloalkyl, hydroxy, amino, mono or diloweralkylamino, carboxy, lower carbalkoxy, carbamoyl, mono or di lower alkyl carbamoyl, phenyl, lower alkanoyl or phenylcarbonyl and R5, R6 and R7 are each hydrogen or lower alkyl and R8 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, carboxy, lower carbalkoxy, or lower alkyl substituted by hydroxy, amino, mono or di lower alkyl amino, or a lower or higher alkanoyl, adamantoyl, carbamoyl, mono or di lower alkyl carbamoyl, C37 cycloalkyl carbonyl or phenyl carbonyl derivative or an 2 N oxide, 2 N lower alkyl or phenyl lower alkyl quaternary derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Examples of salts are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts, especially sodium or disodium salts.Acid addition salts may be formed from pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable inorganic and organic acids and include the salts of hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, sulphuric, citric, lactic, maleic, pamoic and tartaric acids. As used herein the term lower refers to radicals containing from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably up to 4 especially one or two carbon atoms and higher refers to radicals containing from 8 to 20, preferably 8 to 16 carbon atoms. The term nitrogen containing heterocyclyl refers to, among others, pyridinyl, imidazolinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, morpholinyl, pyrrolyl and pyrrolidinyl. Examples of compounds of formula I are a l,2,3,4,10,14b hexahydro 2 methyldibenzo c,f pyrazinolEl, 2 a azepine, b l,3,4,14b tetrahydro 2 methyl lOH pyrazino C1, 2 i pyrroloE2, 1 c El, 4 benzodiazepine and c 1,3,4, 14b tetrahydro 2 methyl 2H dibenzo Eb, f3 pyrazinoEl, 2 d El, 4 oxazepine and salts thereof. Preferred salts of these compounds are the hydrochloride of compound a , the maleate of compound b and the monohydrobromide of compound c . The compounds of formula I are known and they, and processes for their preparation, are disclosed and described in UK Patent No. 1 173 783, UK Patent No.1 229 252 and US Patent No. 4 316 900. It is believed that a suitable dose of a compound of formula I or a derivative or salt thereof, for use in the present treatment, would be in the range 0.001 to lOOmg kg, which dose may be repeated as and when required. Particularly suitable ranges include 0.01 to lOmg kg and especially 0.01 to Smg kg.Nevertheless it will be appreciated that the dose used in practice will depend on the species to which the dose is administered and on the route of administration. Pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions of a compound of formula I or a derivative or salt thereof hereinafter referred to as the drug will, of course, be adapted for administration to the humans or animals to be treated. Thus, for example, the composition may be a shaped composition, such as a bolus, tablet or capsule. In such cases the pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier will be chosen from the usual range of lubricants, dispersants, binders, fillers and the like. When these shaped compositions are for administration to cattle and pigs often they may for instance weigh at least 1 g, on occasions at least 2 g. For administration to humans, especially children, the drug may suitably be presented as a syrup including suitable colouring and or flavouring agents. Such syrups are conveniently presented in unit or multi dose containers. For veterinary use the composition may also be a dispersion or a solution of the drug in a suitable vehicle for use with an oral doser this is a well known item of farm equipment, basically comprising a liquid reservoir, a mouthpiece adapted for insertion into animals mouths, and a pump mechanism whereby unit doses can be ejected from the reservoir through the mouthpiece . Conveniently the drug may be administered from an oral doser as an aqueous solution.Alternatively, the vehicle will be an oil or water based cream to ensure homogeneity of the unit doses administered. The invention, therefore, also provides an oral doser containing a multi dose of the drug in a veterinarily acceptable vehicle. The drugs of the invention may also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. Thus the invention also provides animal feed or animal drinking water containing a compound of formula I or a derivative or salt thereof. It will be convenient to formulate these animal feed and drinking water compositions with a multi dose of the drug so that the animal takes in an appropriate quantity of the drug along with its diet.It will also be convenient to present the composition of the invention as a premix for addition to the feed or drinking water. With human babies or young animals, a particularly useful technique is to blend the drug with the milk provided for them. The compositions of the invention may also be formulated for injection. In such cases the drug chosen is suitably dissolved in water for injection. Alternatively the drug may be administered in a solution used for parenteral fluid replacement therapy. Treatment of diarrhoea and scours using the drug may be supplemented by oral rehydration therapy such as those described in U.K. Patent No. 1,581,826 and GermanOffenlegungsschrift No. 28 54 281, UK PatentApplication No. 2 012 163A, US Patent No. 3 898 328,Nalin, D.R. and Cash, R.A., Bull. World Health Org., 43, 361 1970 , French Patent No. 2 467 599, UK PatentNo. 1 465 308 and as described in SecretoryDiarrhoea , Ed M. Field, J.S. Fordtran and S,G,Schultz, American Physiological Society, Maryland, 1980 pp 179 185 and Lancet, 1975 pp 79 and 80. Conveniently the drug may be administered with the oral rehydration formulation. Accordingly the present invention provides, in a particular aspect, a formulation for treating diarrhoea which comprises an effective non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a derivative or salt thereof, as hereinbefore defined, and an oral rehydration composition comprising a pharmacologically acceptable aqueous solution containing at least 0.5t w v of an actively absorbed monosaccharide, at least 25 mM sodium ions and having an osmolarity less than 500 mOsmolar. Preferably the oral rehydration composition further comprises actively absorbed amino acids and electrolytes. The drug may be presented as a formulation containing one or more components of the oral rehydration composition for admixture with the remaining components. Alternatively the drug may be provided separately and administered simultaneously or sequentially with the oral rehydration formulation. Often it will be appropriate to include in the compositions a further medicine such as an antibacterial agent for example an antibiotic such as amoxycillin or neomycin or a sulphonamide such as sulfadoxin, an agent to alter intestinal motility such as loperamide or a material such as pectin. The amount of drug administered must, of course, be sufficient to bring about the desired effect and will also depend on the body weight of the recipient and the chosen route of administration. Useful dosage units based on such dosage would contain from 0.01 mg to 500 mg of the drug, more suitably 0.01 mg to 250mg. Of course, it will be appreciated that many preferred compositions of the invention are in multi dose form as, for the therapy of animals, it is often most desirable to be able rapidly to treat a number of animals. Such multi dose compositions will contain, by way of example, at least 0.1 mg of the drug. Depending on the exact nature of the said multi dose composition, often it will contain at least 1 g of the drug, and on occasions as much as 5 g.Doses may be administered once or several times daily. The following Formulations illustrate the invention but are not intended to limit the invention in any way.
