# Symmetric blanket nuclear fuel assembly.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a blanket fuel assembly for use as part of a radial blanket in a nuclear reactor core. The assembly utilizes fuel rods 18 containing fertile material, e.g., natural uranium, and fuel rods 18 containing fissile material, e.g. enriched uranium, the two groups of fuel rods being arrayed in symmetrical relationship such that the group with the fissile material surrounds the one with the fertile material.
