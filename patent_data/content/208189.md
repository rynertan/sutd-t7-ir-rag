## Abstract
An optical fiber laser 10 comprising a gain cavity in the form of a single mode optical fiber 12 with integrally formed reflective end sections 18, 20 for provision of feedback. One end section 18 is an etalon for modifying the gain cavity resonant characteristics and intensity modulation, and the other end section 20 is used to alter gain cavity effective length to tune and frequency modu late. The emission spectrum of the laser gain material, which is preferably neodymium oxide incorporated in a silicate glass core, along with the etalon section reflection, pump energy level, and gain cavity length cooperate so that lasing takes place over just a single line of narrow width or over more than one line within a narrow band. Electro optic material in the end sections permit output frequency and amplitude to be selectively activated in response to the application of applied voltages.

## Description
This invention in general relates to optical radiation sources and in particular to improvements in lasers suitable for use in optical communication systems. Communication by means of optical electromagnetic radiation transmitted along optical fibers is now a well established practice made possible by the development over the past 25 years of reliable, coherent sources, low loss optical transmission fibers, and suitable detectors. Motivating this rapid progress was the proposal of the optical maser by A. L. Schawlow and C. H. Townes in 1958 and the subsequent announcement by T. H. Maiman in 1960 of its actual reduction to practice with laser action in ruby. With the achievement of the coherent, or quasi coherent, source came the recognition that the efficient transmission of radiation from laser sources along glass optical fibers of suitably low atten uation could provide communication systems which offered significant advantages over metallic cables, the most important of which was dramatically higher information carrying capacities. In addition, compactness and sub stantially reduced weight along with lower manufacturing and installation costs were also incentives adding impetus to this progress to the point where now systems operating near the theoretical shot noise limit for signal power at the detector and information capacity in a given wavelength interval are under consideration for installation in the field. The higher information capacity of optical systems exists because a communication channel requires the same bandwidth regardless of the region of the spectrum in which it is located, and the higher frequency regions, the optical regions, have far more room for channels and consequently have a much greater potential capacity than the lower competitive frequencies. To fully exploit this capacity in an economic way, however, places certain requirements on optical sources for use in such systems. The basic characteristics for a light source for use in communications applications, and those which govern achievable system performance, include the source spectral emission such as wavelength, line width, and wavelength stability, power output, physical size, power efficiency, life, coherence, cost, and modulatability. Source spectral emission must complement the optical fiber attenuation and dispersion properties if efficient use of source power is to be made. Attenuation characteristics of optical fiber waveguides varies as a function of wavelength, generally decreasing with in creasing wavelength. Regions from 0.8 to 1.6 micrometers have attractive low loss transmission. At the shorter wavelength end, loss is sufficiently low for many appli cations, but where maximum distance is to be covered between repeaters, the longer spectral region from 1.2 to 1.6 micrometers is more suitable. Source spectral width is also an important consideration since the refractive index of fiber material also varies with wavelength. This latter property, known as material dispersion, causes pulse spreading which reduces the data rate capacity of the fiber, and the pulse spreading is more severe with spectrally wider sources than with narrower. Consequent ly, it is important that the spectral width of the source be as narrow as possible to be consistent with high data rate transmission. Inasmuch as the spectral emission characteristics of the source vary with temperature, it is important to keep in mind how these changes occur and to provide appropriate temperature control where necessary for the application in mind. In wavelength division multiplexing applica tions, it is important that the width of the spectral emission of the source be as narrow as possible to achieve a high density of multiplexing. For wavelength multiplexing, the line width and its shape directy influence adjacent channel cross talk levels. A set of sources with a narrow emission spectrum of a few tenths of a nanometer, forming a set of non overlapping spectral sources, can be used effectively to achieve wavelength multiplexing within a spectral range. If these sources criterion would allow, selective filters can be used. In general then, the source spectral output should be in a region where fiber attenuation is low and should be of narrow bandwidth to minimize dispersion effects and maximize both channel density and bandwidth, all while being very stable. High signal power output is desirable because with higher power more attenuation can be tolerated before signal power level falls below a level for satisfactory detection. In addition, the power output distribution should be such that efficient coupling to the fiber is possible given its diameter and numerical aperture. At the other extreme, the power should not be so high as to exceed the material linearity limits unless for some special purpose that is intended. The power efficiency of the source determines how much input power is required of the pump and, hence, also the heat dissipation requirements. Poor efficiency means higher input power requirements for given power output. This can present power supply problems for remotely located equipment. Inefficiently converted source energy also results in excessive heating, requir ing appropriate heat dissipation arrangements otherwise unnecessary. Reliability is of considerable importance, particularly where the optical source is to be used as one of a group in a system. Here both absolute life and mean time between failures MTBF are important param eters because they directly influence the reliability of the system overall. Absolute life for most applications is about 100,000 hours while for system applications a satisfactory MTBF is on the order of 10,000 hours or better. Coherence is a property of sources which gives an indication of the ability of different parts of the wave train emanating from the source to interfere with one another and is of two types, spatial coherence and temporal coherence. The temporal coherence of a wave reflects the narrowness of the frequency spectrum and coherent light is equivalent to a single frequency wave train with a frequency spectrum that can be expressed by only a single, monochromatic line. On the other hand, a wave with several frequency components, or a wave that consists of superimposed random short wave trains is said to be incoherent. In practice, it is extremely difficult to achieve a completely coherent wave. Since maximum bandwidth depends on spectral width, it is important for the source temporal coherence to be as good as possible consistent with the objectives of the system. Cost is a comparative requirement, but it should not be so high that it overly burdens the overall system cost on a comparative basis with competitive systems and should take into consideration not only the cost of the basic device, but any equipment cost associated with the operation of the device itself. Carrier waves provided by optical sources, like other carrier waves, have information imposed on them through the process of modulation. That is, some optical property of the carrier wave is modified in correspondence with a coding scheme, and the information is subsequently extracted from the carrier wave by suit able encoding techniques. If the output of the source has low temporal coherence, it is difficult to achieve phase and frequency modulation, but intensity modulation in analog and digital form is readily implemented and extensively used. Modulation can be either internal, i.e., within a light generating source, or external. With an internal modulator, the output of the carrier source, such as a semiconductor laser, is made to vary in accordance with changes in the injection current, which typically serves as the electrical analog of the information signal. External modulators accept a source output as an input and then change some property of the source output for transmission along the fiber trunk line. The rate of modulation is determined by the speed of the drive circuits and the response time con stants of the source or external modulator as the case may be. The faster the response time, the wider the bandwidth signal to be handled. Those skilled in the art have developed a variety of sources which satisfy the above requirements, some more perfectly than others depending on detailed differences, but all share in common fundamental ideas of operation. For lasing optical sources, the conditions for laser oscillation in the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum well understood. Fundamentally, these require that the laser material be capable of fluorescing and that an inversion in population take place between two different energy levels between which the fluorescent emission takes place. There is also the requirement that there be an adequate absorption of the pumping energy to permit pumping action by the light source. In addition, feedback is required through the resonant cavity containing the laserable material. The ruby laser demonstrated by Maiman in 1960 was single crystal aluminum oxide doped with chromimum impurities. During the intervening years, several crystalline or glass systems with impurity ions as, for example, glass doped with neodymium or other rare earth ions, have been developed. A large number of gas lasers with outputs in the range from the far IR infrared to the UV ultra violet are known. Important among these are helium neon, argon, and krypton as well as several molecular gas systems such as carbon dioxide and molecular nitrogen N2 . Solid state semiconductor lasers are known where the electron current flowing across a junction between P and N type material produces extra electrons in a conduction band. These radiate upon their making a transition back to the valence band or lower energy states. If the junction current is large enough, there will be more electrons near the edge of the conduction band than there are at the edge of the valence band and a population inversion may occur. Aside from the basic known material systems and structures, lasers in the form of optical fibers in which the lasing material has been incorporated into the core have been proposed, for example, in U.S. Patents No. 3,958,188 and No. 4,044,315. In spite of the many innovations made in the laser art, improved laser structures are still required and can be usefully employed in optical fiber communica tion systems and in other systems, as well, for a variety of applications. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved laser structure. It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved laser structure capable of being modulated both in frequency and intensity. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a stable laser having as an output a single narrow line or band of lines where each line in the band is itself narrow. It is yet another object of the present inven tion to provide an improved laser structure having narrow output bandwidths at either 0.92, 1.06, 1.34, 1.54, or 2.0 micrometers more or less. Other objects of the invention will, in part, be obvious and will, in part, appear hereinafter. The invention accordingly comprises the structure exemplified in the detailed disclosure which follows. This invention generally relates to optical sources and specifically to improvements in lasers par ticularly suitable for use in optical communications systems requiring high channel density and data trans mission rates. The laser of the invention comprises an optical gain cavity in the form of a single mode optical fiber in which the laser gain material, preferably neodymium oxide, is present in the fiber core, which is preferably a host of silicate glass. Phosphate, germanate, and mixtures of these with silicate glasses are also suitable. Integrally formed on each end of the optical fiber gain cavity are reflection sections which operate to provide feedback for lasing action. One end section comprises an etalon, variable to intensity or frequency modulate the laser output and cause the output, in combination with the laser material to preferably lase at a single narrow line or group of adjacent narrowly separated resonant lines of the gain cavity which are themselves of narrow linewidth. Either or both end sections can contain elec tro optic, acousto optic, or piezo electric devices to tune or frequency modulate the laser output. Associated with these end section devices are conductive layers to selectively change their characteristics in response to externally applied voltages. When an RF radio frequency signal of suitable frequency is applied to the etalon section so as to modulate the cavity losses, the laser becomes mode locked to provide a comb of stable frequency lines suitable for use as channel carriers and which furthermore have their phases so adjusted to give an output of well defined pulses separated by the time it takes for light to travel down and back through the total length of the laser. Pump power is preferably suppled by a laser diode and is preferably end coupled into the laser core via bulk optics. The novel features that are considered characteristic of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, including its organization, material structure, and method of operation, together with other objects and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following detailed description when read in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein the same number has been used to denote a part wherever it appears in the figures and wherein The inventive optical fiber laser is one which is highly stable and tunable with the capability of pro viding an output of one or more lines of narrow width and narrow spacing, if of more than one line. It also has features by which it can be modulated in intensity, phase, and frequency, or combinations thereof, and which allow it to be mode locked, all attributes which make it extremely desirable for use in communications systems requiring high channel density and data transmission capacity. The desirable characteristics of the inventive laser are achieved through the use of a combination of functional elements and a material system which may best be understood by now referring to Fig. 1 where the inventive laser is designated generally at 10. The major components of laser 10 are a gain cavity in the form of a single mode optical fiber 12 which comprises a core 14 surrounded by a cladding 16. At the left end of optical fiber 12 is a variable etalon section 18, and at its right end a tuning and frequency modulation section 20, both of which can be integrally formed with the optical fiber 12. Both tuning and mod ulation could be at the same end. Energy from a pump source in the form of a laser diode 22 is preferably coupled into the end of the fiber core 14 through the tuning and frequency modulation section 20 by way of a bulk optical arrangement designated generally at 24. The pump source could also couple by a fiber optic element or be butt coupled. The laser optical fiber cavity 12 is structured to propagate just single mode over the desired output line width or line to eliminate the effects of modal dispersion known to reduce data transmission rates. To make the fiber 12 suitable to propagate single mode, its geometry and material parameters are selected to satisfy the well known relation 2πa λ n₁² n₂² Having assured that the core 14 propagates at only the wavelength or wavelengths of interest, it is provided with an effective length, L The output of laser 10 depends on the collec tive optical action attributable to its effective length. L As in other resonant cavity structures, the effective length, L The wavelength separation between resonant modes of the cavity is determined by changing the value of N and then subtracting successive possible resonant wavelengths, assuming nearly equal values, to arrive at the following equation for expressing the separation between modes Δλ λ² 2L An inspection of this equation reveals that the shorter the resonant cavity, the greater the spacing between resonant modes or between channels transferrable. The line spread of each of the resonant orders, assuming no internal losses and equal reflector values, is given by the following equation From this equation, it can be seen that the effect of increasing the resonant cavity length is to reduce the line spread of its resonant orders. In practice, the length of the single mode optical fiber 12 is approximated so that its resonant cavity core 14 will resonate at modes which contain the single mode, or adjacent group of modes, desired, keeping in mind that the reflection characteristics of sections 18 and 20 have an effect on the true effective length and thus on which of these modes are possible, particularly section 18, as will subsequently be seen. The overall length of the laser can vary by one or more orders of magnitude as desired. For example, a 10 centimeter long laser to produce an output of 1.058 micrometers having an effective index of refraction n The variable etalon section 18 includes two spaced apart parallel filters, 28 and 30, which are separated by an electro optical material 32 of nominal thickness, d. The electro optic material 32 preferably is one which has a high electro optic coefficient and is transparent to radiation at wavelengths desired as output from the laser 10. Although not shown, it is preferred to place a conductive coating around the electro optic material 32 so that its optical characteristics may be easily changed in response to the application of an ex ternal voltage. This may be done in a well known manner to, for example, change the nominal distance, d, to alter the optical path length over this region and thus obtain effects which will subsequently be described. The filters, 28 and 30, are made dichroic so as not to transmit undesired wavelengths back to the fiber core 14 and, along with the electro optic material 32, are arranged to be perpendiclar to the optical axis of ity, R, at normal incidence, wavelength λ , thickness, d, and index of refraction n is given by With the reflectivities of the two filters, 28 and 30, taken equal to r, the above becomes R 4r sin² 1 r ² 4r sin² The reflection characteristics of the individu al filters, 28 and 30, are preferably achieved using well known interference filter coatings. The tuning and frequency modulation section 34 and 36, which are also arranged to be perpendicular to the optical axis of the optical fiber core 14, and these filters are also separated by a very thin electro optical material 38, preferably with conductive coatings for selectively applying electric fields for reasons to follow. The filters, 34 and 36, are also dichroic and, in the direction of incoming energy, are highly transmis sive to the pump energy wavelength but highly reflective with respect to the output operating wavelength of the laser 10 so as to provide the necessary feedback for laser action. At the output operating wavelength for the laser 10, a satisfactory value for the joint reflectivity of the filters, 28 and 30, is 85 and individually 50 while 50 has been satisfactory for the filter 34, and for the filter 36, close to 100 . To assist in fabricating both the laser end sections, 18 and 20, the optical fiber laser is placed inside of a glass capillary tube 26 and is potted there to remain fixed in place. The ends of this tube, along with the optical fiber 12 are ground and polished and the filter sections, 18 and 20, are then coupled to the polished ends in a well known manner. In this way, the capillary tube 26 both aids in the fabrication of the end sections and provides a means for easily handling laser 10. For this purpose, the outside diameter of the capillary tube 26 is made to be several millimeters, or more, for convenience. Now, as is well known, an atomic medium with an inverted population is capable of amplifying an electromagnetic wave if the latter s frequency falls within the transition line shape. If the laser medium is placed inside an optical resonator, the electromagnetic wave bounces back and forth between the two reflectors and picks up an additional amount of energy on each pass between them. If the amplification exceeds the losses caused by imperfect reflection in the mirrors and scat tering within the laser medium, the energy stored in the resonator will increase with time. This causes the amp lification constant to decrease as a result of the gain saturation. The oscillation level will keep increasing until the saturated gain per pass just equals the losses. At this point, the net gain per pass is unit and no further increase in the radiation intensity is possible. Mathematically, for laser 10, this reduces to Although there are a number of material systems that may be used to achieve the necessary laser condition, it is preferable that the lasing medium be neodymium oxide incorporated into a silicate host glass serving as the base material for the fiber core 14. The cladding material is preferably a silicate, but can also be any other suitable material. A core material which has been found to be successful is one which is supplied by Schott Glass Technologies, Inc. and designated in their catalog with the identification, LG660 silicate. This is a silicate glass doped with 1 1 2 by weight of neodymium oxide. The absorption spectrum for this mate rial is given in Fig. 3 while its relative fluorescence or emission spectrum is shown in Fig. 4, where it can be seen that there is a peak fluorescent output line at a wavelength of 1.058 micrometers. This is the preferred output wavelength for the laser 10 and, as will be seen, it is possible to achieve this frequency or a small bandwidth of frequencies surrounding it. As will be appreciated by observing Fig. 4, the relative fluorescence spectrum of the core material is quite broad in bandwidth. This is characteristic of a gain material incorporated in a glass base or host mate rial and is a consequence of the amorphous structure of the glass. It is referred to in the art as inhomogeneous broadening and results at least in part from the fact that each ion of the laser material does not experience exactly the same environment within the host material. Thus, even though the peak wavelength possible with this material system is highly desirable, it will be appre ciated by those skilled in the art that the line width of the emission spectrum for this material is broader than that most desired for communications purposes and would benefit from some means of suppressing all possible resonant orders for the fiber cavity which could exist under this gain curve but which are not desired. As mentioned previously, this is accomplished by the cooper ative action of the product of the reflection character istics of the etalon end section 18 and the gain curve along with the pump energy level. Laser diode 22 is preferably a well known gal lium aluminum arsenide type with a spectral output at approximately .8 micrometers and an emission line confin ed to a wavelength interval less than 300 angstroms. Its power level is regulated by controlling its injection current, and the bulk optics 24 are preferably chosen to carefully match the NA numerical aperture of the laser diode 22 to the NA of the optical fiber 12 which is approximately 0.3, for example. Thus, these components represent a means by which it is possible to controllably couple energy into the fiber core 12 to cause the popula tion inversion above threshold to provide lasing action in the cavity and thus satisfy one requirement for con trolling the laser frequency output. As will be appreci ated by observing Fig. 3, the spectral line output of the laser diode 22 occurs at one of the peak absorption bands for the material in the region just above 0.8 micro meters. The reflection characteristic of the etalon section 18 is shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen there, it is periodic in nature, repeating every integral number of wavelengths with maxima separated by one half wave length. The curve of Fig. 5 represents the reflection characteristic for a given nominal spacing, d. If the spacing, d, changes, then there is a shift in this reflection characteristic along the wavelength axis as shown in Fig. 10. Reference is now made to Fig. 6 which shows how the output of the laser 10 may be made to vary by changing the thickness, d, of the end section 18. Here, the output intensity, which is for all wavelengths, is represented as some value I₀ which would be the output with only one mirror present in the end section 18. This output, I₀, may be changed in the form of a decaying harmonic function as pictured in Fig. 6 with a maximum value occurring where the thickness, d, is 1 4 wavelength away from no thickness. Thus, if one wishes to obtain maximum output, one of the things that can be done is to make sure that the thickness, d, exceeds 1 4 wavelength. However, because the output of the fiber core is Gaussi an, with an initial plane wavefront immergence pattern that turns into a spherical wavefront pattern downstream of the plane wavefront pattern, as shown in Fig. 7, it will be recognized that there is some outer limit on the thickness if efficient feedback is to be made from the section 18 back into the fiber core 14. Consequently, the thickness, d, should be chosen so that it is still within the field location where the wavefronts from the fiber core 14 are still planar, but not so close as to be closer than 1 4 wavelength away from the outside surface of the reflector 30. The reflection function of the etalon section 18 has in form an inverted Fabry Perot characteristic which is selected by a careful choice of the design parameters so that, at one of its maximum reflection points, it is aligned with the peak emission line for the fluorescence spectrum of the fiber core material as shown in Fig. 8. The separation between maxima, or if you like minimum reflection points, is chosen so that within this bandwidth there exists a number of resonant orders for the fiber core resonant cavity. It has been discovered that orders of the fiber core resonant cavity which are in side orders of the end section 18 resonant filter characteristics are completely suppressed, even when the pumping energy exceeds laser threshold. If the fiber resonant cavity is made shorter to increase the free spectral range between its resonant modes, it should be possible to even further reduce the number of orders which will resonate to to the point where it is believed that a single order can be achieved. Of course, as the laser pump energy level is increased, more of the reso nant orders of the fiber core will be excited and will thus be present, except that orders outside of the peak reflectance region centered on the peak spectral emission line will be excluded from lasing. As an example, with this basic material system, it has been observed that, in a 10 centimeter optical fiber core cavity and an etalon section 18 with a thick ness of about 60 microns, that it is possible to excite within a bandwidth of approximately 1 angstrom, separate lines with line widths less than 200 kilohertz. Repeated measurements have indicated that this output of adjacent lines is extremely stable and can be reduced in numbers by the simple expedient of reducing the overall length of the optical fiber cavity to the point where it is possible, with looped fiber filters or with short, straight Fabry Perot interferometers as herein described, to isolate single resonant orders within that bandwidth. Alternatively, it should be possible to excite just one of the orders as mentioned previously by reducing cavity length. By comparison with a resonant cavity 10 centi meters long but not having the etalon end section 18, it was observed that the output bandwidth was 100 angstroms wide. By the addition of the etalon, a reduction in bandwidth by two orders of magnitude occurred. Con sequently, with this structure and material system, optical sources of high stability with extremely narrow bandwidths and separation between resonant orders have been provided. Where it is required to intensity modulate the output of the laser 10, one may exploit the properties of the filtering characteristics of the section 18 shown in Fig. 6. Here it can be seen that one can go between maximum and minimum points by changing the thickness, d, by 1 4 wavelength. Consequently, the excitation of the electro optic material 32 can be used as a means for varying the thickness, d, over 1 4 wavelength to intensity modulate the laser output. By referring to Fig. 7, it can be seen that a change in the thickness, d, also results in a shift of the reflection characteristic curve of the etalon section 18 along the wavelength axis, and thus, there is a shift in the wavelength under the laser material gain curve at which the laser emits radiation. Consequently, one can also achieve wavelength shifts in the output of the laser by activating the electro optic material 32. This, however, not only shifts wavelengths, but as also explained, changes intensity. A small amount of modu lation could give useful frequency modulation without significant intensity variations. If it is required to simply change frequency or to tune the laser 10 for output at a particuar wave length, use may be made of the end section 20. Here, activation of the electro optical material 38 changes the overall effective length of the optical resonant cavity and thus can be used as the means for selecting the output wavelength in accordance with the basic equation governing optical resonant cavities previously discussed . Thus, the end section 20 can be used as a means for either tuning the laser or as a means for frequency modulating its output without in any way disturbing its overall amplitude. To enhance these features, use may be made of electronic feedback arrangements to further achieve stability at particular wavelengths. As mentioned before, the reflectance character istic for the filters 34 and 36 is shown in generalized form in Fig. 11 and for the particular example given had a high transmission with respect to energy coming from the laser pump system travelling towards the fiber core 14 and a high reflectance with respect to energy propa gating in the core towards the end section 20. Prefer ably, the transmission of the filter 34 is 50 , while that of the filter 36 is as high as possible, approxi mating 100 . When an RF signal at a frequency related to the round trip cavity time to 2L It will be recognized that the overall effec tive length of the optical fiber resonant cavity core was an approximation in the discussion above since it is affected by the effect of the end sections, 18 and 20. In practice, any differences between the mathematics and the actual performance is compensated for through careful experimentation to evaluate these additional effects. What has been provided then is an optical source which lases over a very narrow bandwidth which for a given etalon encompasses more or less modes, depending on the effective length of the compound cavity and the pump energy level. With the pump energy level just above threshold and the effective compound cavity length short, it should be possible to resonate in just one mode or at most a few modes from which one can be extracted using known filtering techniques. Whether one wants just a single mode or more than one depends on the end use. In any event, the output in either case is highly stable and narrow band as a consequence of the basic material system and the integrated mechanical structure. Those skilled in the art may practice the invention in other ways in accordance with its teachings and still be within its scope. For example, one could dope with erbium for a 1.54 micrometer output, holmium for a 2.0 micrometer, and ytterbium may also be used at 1.06 micrometer.
