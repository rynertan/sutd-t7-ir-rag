# Strippable coatings for optical fiber.

## Abstract
Radiation curable coating compositions particularly adapted to reduce the adhesion of the radiation cured coatings to glass optical fibers and thereby enhance strippa bility are disclosed. These comprise a radiation curable polyethylenic organic compound and from about 2 , to about 20 , of the coating composition of an organic polysilo xane carrying a plurality of hydroxy terminated groups which are joined to some of the silicon atoms in the polysiloxane chain by a carbon to silicon bond. The polysilo xane reduces the adhesion of the radiation cured coating to the glass surface of the fiber. Ultraviolet cures using acrylates as the ethylenic group are preferred.
