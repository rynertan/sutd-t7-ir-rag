# Recuperative burner.

## Abstract
The invention is a recuperative burner, with heat exchange between the exhausting combustion products and incoming combustion air to the burner nozzle, in which the recuperator essentially comprises separable components of conical shape. The advantages are ease of dismantling, even if the conical components have distorted in use improved flexibility of design, resulting in better efficiency and reduced formation of nitrogen oxides and lower costs for both manufacture and maintenance.
