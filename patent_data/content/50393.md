# FINLINE CIRCUIT CONFIGURATION

## Abstract
To provide a microwave finline configuration which has no equivalent in unilateral finline, two different finline circuits extend in a common length of waveguide 1, 2 , suitably on opposite major surfaces of a common dielectric substrate 3 . A pair of Doppler mixers may have identical finline circuit patterns formed by sheet conductors 4 and 5, 6 and 7 with identical mixer diodes 10, 11 connected across their respective fin transmis sion lines, the finline circuits differing in the longitudinal positions of the diodes 10, 11 , which positions are such as to provide respective beat frequency output signals, via low pass filters 12, 13 , in phase quadrature.
