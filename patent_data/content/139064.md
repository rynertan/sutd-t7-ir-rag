## Description
NOVEL SCAVENGERS FOR ONE COMPONENT RTV COMPOSITIONS Background of the Invention The present invention relates to alkoxy functional RTV compositions, and more particularly, the present in vention relates to alkoxy functional, one component, RTV compositions having novel scavengers which scavengers can also be utilized as cross linking agents in some cases. RTV in this patent application refers to room temperature vulcanizable. One component and two component, alkoxy functional RTV compositions are well known. See, for instance, the disclosures of Beers, U.S. Patent 4,100,129, Nitzsche et al., U.S. Patent 3,127,363, and Nitzsche et al., U.S. Patent 3,065,194.Recently, there has been dis covered or invented, nove one component, alkoxy function al, RTV compositions which are shelf stable. It is postulated that in previous alkoxy functional, one component, RTV compositions, that the composition after being prepared and upon standing, and as a result of hav ing excess hydroxy groups in the polymer mixtures, would degrade the polymer mixture such that it would not cure at a sufficient rate after having been stored for any substantial period of time such as a month or more. Even if such a composition would cure after prolonged storage, still the cured composition did not achieve its maximum or optimum physical properties. It should be noted that even commercial, one component, alkoxy functional, RTV compositions, such as that of Beers, U.S.Patent 4,100,129 mentioned above, suffered to some extent from this problem. The hypothesis for the reasons for the problem as well as the solutions to the problem, i.e., shelf stable, onecomponent, alkoxy functional, RTV system, is to be found more fully set forth iz Wh et al., Docket RD 13,275, Serial No. 277,524, filed on June 26, 1981, which is hereby incorporated by reference. A related case is Halgren,Docket RD 13,42 , Serial No. 277,525, which was filed onJune 26, 1981. Basically, these dockets, and particularlyDocket RD 13,275, White et al., disclose the use of scavengers and integrated scavengers and cross linkers having certain types of functionality to be utilized to absorb or react with all or most of the unbonded hydroxy groups in the polymer mixture such that the polymer mixture will remain shelf stable. Other related applications that have been filed since the filing of the White et al. case, Docket RD 13,275, are for instance, Chung, Docket No. 60Si 569, Serial No. 338,518, filed January 11, 1982. The Clung case relates to the use of cyclic amides or novel cyclic amide compounds as scavengers and integrated cross linking agents for the RTV systems of White et al., DocketRD 13,275. Since that time, there have also been filed Beers,Docket 60Si 640, Serial No. 349,537, Lucas et al., Docket 60Si 585, Serial No. 349,538, and Dziark, Docket 60Si 579, Serial No. 349,695, all filed on February 17, 1982. TheBeers Docket, 60Si 640, relates to the use of various ingredients in the composition to render the composition low modulus with good self bonding properties.The patent application of Lucas et al., Docket 605if585, relates to the use of certain novel, self bonding additives for the RTV composition of White et al., DocketRD 13,275. Finally, the Dziark patent application,Docket 60Si 579, relates to the use of certain silazane compounds as scavengers for the basic RTV compositions disclosed in Docket RD 13,275. However, it should be noted that the silazane compounds of Dziark, et al.,Docket 60Si 579, are solely scavengers. That it, they are utilized after the alkoxy terminated, diorganopolysiloxane polymer is first formed. After it is formed, then the silazane scavengers of Dziark et al., Docket 60Si 579, are added.These silazane compounds of Dziark,Docket 60Si 579, most of which are well known, react with the unbonded hydroxy groups in the polymer mixture and tie them up such that they cannot react or further cross link to degrade the basic polymer that is needed in the system. Further, in the compositions of Dziark, et al., as disclosed in one aspect in White et al.,Docket RD 13,275, the alkoxy terminated diorganopolysiloxane polymer has to be formed first, by reacting a silanol terminated diorganopolysiloxane polymer with an alkyl trialkoxysilane in the presence of an amine.Then once the multialkoxy terminated diorganopolysiloxane polymer is formed, the scavenger can be added to the system along with the other ingredients to react with all the unbonded hydroxy groups in the RTV system. The silazane scavengers of Dziark, Docket 60Si579, suffer from the fact that they cannot be utilized as cross linkers that is, they can be used only as scavengers. As noted in Docket RD 13, 275, it is desirable also in many cases to have integrated crosslinker scavengers, which materials can act both as scavengers and as cross linking agents, for theWhite et al. RTV systems. Accordingly, it was highly desirable to find silazane cross linker scavenger compounds which could be utilized in the White et al. systems. Specifically, silazane scavengers and silazane integrated cross linkers as scavengers are desirable since they are inexpensive to make, they give a by product of ammonia when they react with the unbonded hydroxy groups which ammonia is innocuous. Another advantage of such silazane scavengers and integrated cross linkers is that only a small amount of such compounds is needed to effect the necessary tieing up of the unbonded hydroxy groups in the polymer system. This results from the high functionality of the silazane compounds and the nitrogen agents that tie up or bond with the unbonded hydroxy groups in the polymer systems. Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide for novel silazane scavengers for alkoxyfunctional, one component, RTV systems. It is another object of the present invention to provide for novel integrated cross linkers, scavengers for alkoxy functional, one component RTV systems. It is still an additional object to provide for alkoxy functional silazane which can be utilized either as a scavenger or as an integrated scavenger, cross linking agent for alkoxy functional, one component, RTV systems. It is still an additional object of the present inve tion to provide a method for producing shelf stable, alkoxy functional, one component, RTV systems by including in the composition an alkoxy functional silazane which can act both as a scavenger and, if desired, as an integrated cross linking agent and scavenger. It is yet still a further object of the present in vention to provide a method for producing a shelf stable, alkoxy functional, one component, RTV system by incorpor ating in the composition, an alkoxy functional silazane which can act either as a scavenger or as an integrated cross linker scavenger for the systems. These and other objects of the present invention are accomplished by the disclosures set forth herein below. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the above objects, there is pro s videdflby the pre5ent invention, a stable, one package, substantially anhydrous and substantially acid free, room temperature, vulcanizable, organopolysiloxane composition, stable under ambient conditions, in the substantial ab sence of moisture over an extended period of time, and con vertible to a tack free elastomer comprising A an organopolysiloxane wherein the silicon atom at each polymer chain end is terminated with at least 2 alkoxy radicals B an effective amount of a condensation catalyst C a stabilizing amount of scavenger for hydroxy functional groups selected from the class consisting of a non cyclic silyl nitrogen scavenger of the formula,EMI7.1 and cyclic silyl nitrogen scavengers having at least one or all of the units of the formula,EMI7.2 and the rest of the units if any, having the formulaEMI7.3 where R10 is a C1 8 aliphatic organic radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkylether, alkylester, alkylketone, alkylcyano, and aryl, R11 is a C18 monovalent substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radical 0 is selected from hydrogen, C1 8 monovalent substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radicals and radicals of the formula EMI8.1 where R10, R11 are as previously defined, where a varies from 0 to 2 where f varies from 0 to 3, h is o or 1, ntere s is a whole number that varies from I to 25, d is a whole number that varies from 1 to 25, R22 is selected from hydrogen and C18 monovalent hydrocarbon radicals andR23 independently is selected from C1 8 monovalent hydrocarbon and hydrocarbonoxy radicals, A is selected from the class consisting of hydrogen and C18 monovalent substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radicals and a radical of the formulaEMI8.2 where R10, R11 are as previously defined, g varies from 0 to 3 and in the above scavengers there is at least one hydrocarbonoxy group in the molecule, R12 is defined the same as R10, and R13 is defined the same as R11, and R14 is defined the same as R11, and optionally D an effective amount of a curing accelerator selected from the group consisting of substituted guanidines, amines, and mixtures thereof. In the case when it is desired to have an integrated cross linker scavenger compound in the RTV system, the same compounds as disclosed above may be utilized, except in such compounds there are at least three alkoxy groups or hydrocarbonoxy groups in the linear, or one alkoxy group in the cyclic on each silicon atom. For s l, where Q is hydrogen, generally there are at least three or four alkoxy groups in the compound for the compound to function as an integrated cross linker scavenger. For polymers where s is greater than 1, andQ is of Formula 4 , preferably for the polymer to function both as an integrated cross linker and scavenger there should be at least two hydrocarbonoxy groups on each terminal silicon atom and at least one hydrocarbonoxy group on each internal silicon atom.However, generally the compound will still function as an integrated crosslinker, even if some of the silicon atoms in the polymer, whether terminal or not, have less than the preferred number of hydrocarbonoxy groups. Three, two or one alkoxy groups in the compound result in it acting effectively as a scavenger, but unfortunately, it does not always have sufficient alkoxy functionality for it to impart to the composition necessary cross linking capabilities. Further, these alkoxy compounds can all be made by traditional processes disclosed in the present case or as disclosed inDziark, Docket 60Si 579, Serial No. 349,695, filedFebruary 17, 1982, referred to previously. Description of the Preferred Embodiment In the formula of the linear or branch chained, 10 noncyclic, silyl nitrogen scavenger, the radical R can be selected from radicals such as alkyl radicals such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc. alkylether radicals such as methylmethylether, methylethylether, methylpropylether, ethylethylether, ethylpropylether, 2 methoxyethyl, 2 ethoxyethyl, 2 propoxymethyl, etc. alkylester radicals such as methyl ester, ethyl ester, propyl ester, butyl ester, 2 acetoxyethyl, 2 acetoxypropyl, etc. alkylketone radicals such as l butan 3 onyl, methyl methyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl methyl ketone, ethyl ethylketone, etc. and alkylcyano radicals such as methyl nitrile and aryl radicals such as phenyl, methyiphenyl, etc.Basically, theR10 radical can be any alkyl and phenyl radical of 1 8 carbon atoms, and more preferably one of the radicals disclosed above. Most preferably, R10 is selected from methyl.In the compound of Formula 1 , R11, R are independently selected from C18 monovalent substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radical such as an alkyl radical such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc. a cycloalkyl radical such as cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, etc. an olefinic radical such as vinyl, allyl, etc. a mononuclear alkyl radical such as phenyl, methylphenyl, ethylphenyl, et. or a sibstituted hydrocarbon radical such as fluoroalkyl radical, such as 3,3,3 22 trifluoropropyl. The radical R is selected from the same radicals and hydrogen. Accordingly, preferably R11 is selected from an alkyl radical of 1 8 carbon atoms and is most preferably methyl. The radical Q is most preferably selected from hydrogen. Alternatively, the radical Q can be selected from any C1 8 monovalent substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radicals which can be any of the radicals defined for Rll with the caveat that desirably, there are no more than eight carbon atoms in the radical. The other part of the definition of the compound of Formula 1 is that a varies from 0 to 2 and f varies from 0 to 3, where Q is selected from hydrogen and C18 monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, and where the sum of a f does not exceed 5, there is at least one alkoxy radical in the compound of Formula 1 . The reason for the restrictions on a and f is so that they will be in accordance with the description of the silazane compounds of the instant invention, and that there will be at least one alkoxy group in the molecule. It should be noted that the manner in which the compounds of the present invention distinguish over the compounds of that of Dziark, Docket 60Si 579, Serial No. 349,695, filed February 17, 1982, is that the compounds of the instant invention have hydrocarbonoxy groups in them. The compounds of the DziarkDocket 60Si 579 case, do not have hydrocarbonoxy groups in them. The advantages of the hydrocarbonoxy groups of the instant case have been set forth previously. Further, in the definition of the compound of Formula 1 is that preferably s is a whole number that varies from 1 25, and is most preferably 1 10, and d is preferably a whole number that varies from 1 25, and is most preferably 1 5. It should be noted that the simpler alkoxy sila zane compounds are the desirable ones since they are the easiest to obtain and are the ones that are obtained in maximum yield. However, the higher molecular weight hydro carbonoxy silazane compounds can also be utilized in the instant invention within the scope of the above formulas. Further, in the foregoing Formula 1 , A is prefer ably selected from the class consisting of hydrogen and the same C1 8 monovalent substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radicals as were defined previously for Roll. Most preferably, A can be selected from hydrogen, methyl, or ethyl radicals. Si CH3 3, Si OCH3 CH3 2, Si OCH3 2 CH3 , Si OCH3 3In the compounds of the foregoing Formulas 1 to 4 , it is preferred that in one embodiment when the silazane 10 11 compound is a scavenger, that R10 and R be methyl, and the Q radical be hydrogen. Accordingly, in one embodi ment, preferably the scavenger has the formulaEMI12.1 In another embodiment of the linear branch chained hydrocarbonoxy silazane compounds of the instant case, it is preferred that the instant compound be a compound having the formulaEMI13.1 Another preferred compound within the scope of the above formula is divinylte tramethoxydi sil azane. Other preferred compounds within the scope of the above formulas are, for instance,EMI13.2 EMI14.1 EMI15.1 1 Methyl 3 ethyl 1,1,3,3 tetramethoxydisilazane 1,3 Diethyl 1,1,3,3 tetramethoxydisilazane 1 Methyl 3 propyl 1,1,3,3 tetramethoxydisolazane 1 Ethyl 3 propyl 1,1,3,3 tetramethoxydisilazane 1,3 Dipropyl 1,1,3,3 tetramethoxydisilazane 1,1,3 Trimethyl 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane 1,1 Dimethyl 3 ethyl 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane 1,1 Dimethyl 3 propyl 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane 1,1 Dimethyl 3 butyl 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane 1,1 Diethyl 3 methyl 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane 1,1 Dipropyl 3 methyl 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane 1,1 Dibutyl 3 methyl 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane 1,1,3 Trimethyl 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane 1,1,3 Triethyl 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane 1,1,3 Tripropyl 1,3,3 Trimethoxydisilazane 1,1 Dimethyl 1,3,3,3 Tetramethoxydisilazane 1,1 Diethyl 1,3,3,3 Tetramethoxydisilazane 1,1 Dipropyl 1,3,3,3 Tetramethoxydisilazane 1,3 Dimethyl 1 ethoxyl 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane 1,3 Diethyl 1 ethoxy 1,3,3 trimethoxydisilazane In addition to the above, linear and branch chained, non cyclic silazane compounds, there can be utilized alkoxy functional cyclic silazane compounds in the instant invention. Accordingly, there can be a cyclic silyl nitrogen scavenger having at least one or all of its units, units of Formula 2 and the rest of the units, if any, having Formula 3 . Preferably, the compound is made up units of of Formula 2 however, the cyclic compound may have units of Formula 2 interspersed with Formula 3 . Eow ever, the caveat holds that the cyclic compound must have at least one hydrocarbonoxy or alkoxy group in the compound as well as be a cyclic silazane compound to be utilized in the instant invention.Preferably, all of the units in the silyl nitrogen compound are selected from those of Formula 2. Preferred cyclic silazane compounds within the scope of the above formulas, are for instance,EMI17.1 EMI18.1 Other preferred compounds within the scope of the cyclic silazanes of the instant case, are for instance, those of FormulasEMI18.2 EMI19.1 Other preferred cyclic compounds within the scope the instant case are compounds of the following formulas.EMI19.2 EMI20.1 2,4,6 Triethyl 2,4,6 trimethoxycyclotrisilazane 2,4,6 Trimethyl 2,4,6 triethoxycyclotrisilazane 2,4,6 Tripropyl 2,4,6 trimethoxycycldotrisilazane 2,4 Dimethyl 6 ethyl 2,4,6 trimethoxycyclotrisilazane 2 Methyl 4,6 diethyl 2,4,6 trimethoxycyclotrisilazane 2,4 Dimethyl 6 propyl 2,4,6 trimethoxycyclotrisilazane 2 Methyl 4,6,dipropyl 2,4,6 trimethoxycyclotrisilazane 2,4,6 trivinyl 2,4,6 trimethoxycyclotrisilazane 2,4 Dimethyl 6 vinyl 2,4,6 trimethoxycyclotrisilazane 2,4 Dimethyl 1 phenyl 2,4,6 trimethoxycyclotrisilazane 2,4,6,8 Tetraethyl 2,4,6,8 tetramethoxycyclotetrasilazane 2,4,6,8 Tetramethyl 2,4,6,8 tetramethoxycyclotetrasilazane 2,4,6,8 tetrapropyl 2,4,6,8 tetramethoxycyclotetrasilazane 2,4,6 Trimethyl 8 ethyl 2,4,6,8 tetramethoxycyclotetrasilazane 2,4,6 trimethyl 8 propyl 2,4,6,8 tetramethoxycyclotetrasilazane 2,4 Dimethyl 6,8 diethyl 2,4,6,8 tetramethoxycyclotetrasilazane 2,6 Dimethyl 4,8 diethyl 2,4,6,8 tetramethoxycyclotetrasilazane 2,4,6,8 tetravinyl 2,4,6,8 tetramethoxyccylotetrasilazane 2,6 dimethyl 4,8 divinyl 2,4,6,8 tetramethoxycyclotetrasilazane 2,4,6 Trimethyl 8 vinyl 2,4,6,8 tetramethoxycyclotetrasilazane It should be noted that in the instant application, there is a distinction between hydrocarbonoxy silazane compounds, whether linear or cyclic, which have at least one hydrocarbonoxy group in them and those that have at least three and preferably four hydrocarbonoxy groups in them, where S l, Q E. The ones that have at least one but less than three or four alkoxy groups can be utilized as scavengers only.Those hydrocarbonoxy silazane compounds of the instant case, S 1, Q H, which have at least three or four hydrocarbonoxy groups in the molecules can be utilized both as scavengers and integrated cross linkers i.e., the compound, if utilized in the proper quantities, will tie up unbonded hydroxy groups in the polymer mixture as well as act as a cross linking agent to cross link the base silanol material so as to form an alkoxy endcapped diorganopolysiloxane polymer, which, upon exposure to atmospheric moisture, will hydrolyze to form a silicone elastomer. For silazane polymer compound that is where S and dare greater than 1, it is preferred that there be at least two hydrocarbonoxy groups in the terminal silicon atoms as well as at least one hydrocarbonoxy group in each internal silicon atom for the compound to function as an vatergrated cross linker. However, the compound will still function as an integrated cross linker even if some silicon atoms including terminal silicon atoms are without hydrocarbonoxy or alkoxy group. Further, if most of the silicon atoms have an alkoxy group in the compound, then it functions as an integrated cross linker, even if the terminal silicon atom has no alkoxy group or just one alkoxy group per silicon atom. Further, the compound can function as an integrated cross linker if it is a mixture of polymer species in which most of the polymer species meet the above conditions. It should be noted further that the compound having at least three hydrocarbonoxy groups in it can also be utilized as a scavenger only irrespective of whether it can function as an integrated cross linker. In any case, when there is utilized a cross linker and the silazane compound has at least three or four hydrocarbonoxy groups in it. As explained above, some of the hydrocarbonoxy silazane compound will function as a cross linking agent as well as a scavenger due to the statistical reactivity results of the composition. In this respect, it should be noted that the hydrocarbonoxy silazane compound which has less than two hydrocarbonoxy groups in it can only function as a scavenger, and, accordingly, must be utilized with this concept in mind. There are some compounds with S 1, QDH with only two hydrocarbonoxy groups in which both groups are on the same silicon atom in which half of the compound can function as integrated cross linker. Row ever, generally most silazane compounds within the instant invention with only 2 hydrocarbonoxy groups in it them when ssl, g H cannot function as an integrated cross linker.With respect to quantities of the compound to be utilized, this is discussed elsewhere in the case, but as a guide there may be utilized per 100 parts by weight of the silanol polymer, 1 to 12, and more preferably from 3 to 7, of a hydrocarbonoxy silazane compound. In the case where the hydrocarbonoxy silazane compound functions both as a crosslinking agent and as a scavenger, then per 100 parts by weight of the base silanol polymer, there is generally utilized 2.0 to 12 parts of the hydrocarbonoxy silazane compound, and preferably 3 to 8 parts of such compounds per 100 parts of the base silanol polymer.These con centration ranges are generally especially in the second case because how much of the hydrocarbonoxy compound that is used as both a cross linking agent and a scavenger will depend on the amount of hydrocarbonoxy groups in the molecules of such hydrocarbonoxy silazane compounds. Further, though the cyclic silazane compound can be any cyclic silazane, but most preferably it is a trisilizane or tetrasilazane since these are the most readily available cyclic silazanes. However, it can also be a pentasilazane or higher cyclosilazane. It must be appreciated as will be explained below, in the normal course of producing such cyclic silazanes, that most of the compounds that are produced are cyclic tetrasilazanes and cyclictrisilazanes.However, some higher cyclic silazanes are also produced and these higher cyclic silazanes in the mixture along with the cyclic trisilazanes and cyclotetrasilazane can be utilized as scavengers or as both scavengers and cross linking agents in the instant invention, depending on their hydrocarbonoxy functionality as is described below. Further, it should be noted when the linear.disilazane is prepared, there is produced along with it in accordance with current processes, some of the trisilazane whose formula was given above. The reason for the fact that there must be the number of hydrocarbonoxy groups in the silazane molecules as explained above in order for the silazanes to function as a cross linking agent as well as a scavenger, is that it is desirable that when the endcapping group ties up the silanol group at the terminal end of the polymer that there is appended to the silyl group at least two alkoxy groups. If this is the case, that is, most of the polymer is terminated by at least two hydrocarbonoxy or alkoxy groups, then such terminated base polymer will be shelf stable and effectively crosslink to produce a shelf stable composition. The rest of the hydrocarbonoxy silazane can simply function to tie up other unbonded hydroxy groups in the polymer mixture that are present other than the hydroxy groups at the terminal end of the silanol terminated diorganopolysiloxane base polymer.Further, as state previously, while the above concentration ranges have been given for the silazane compounds, both in the case when they are utilized as scavengers only or when they are utilized as scavengers and cross linking agents, these concentrations are just general guides and are not critical. What is important is that there be a minimum amount of silazane compound irrespective of whether it is to function as a scavenger only or both as a scavenger and an integrated cross linker.Accordingly, this minimum amount of silazane compound is at least 3 excess over the stoichiometric amount needed to react with all the excess water and all the excess unbonded hydroxy groups in the polymer mixture, and generally, in most compositions, can be set at the level of at least one part by weight of scavenging silazane compound per 100 parts of the base silanol end stopped diorganopolysiloxane polymer. Proceeding first to the linear end branch chained non cyclic silazanes, these can be made by a well known procedure. First of all, there may be taken the appropriate chlorosilane and reacted with an aliphatic alcohol to alkoxylate the desired amount of chlorine groups in the chlorosilane. Generally, this reaction takes place at from 0 to 500C. and more preferably takes place at a temperature from 0 to 250C. The time of a reaction can be anywhere from 12 to 24 hours and is more preferably 12 to 16 hours. There results about an 80 yield of the alkoxylated desired product. Once the alkoxylated silane is obtained with the desired amount of alkoxylation, there is obtained an alkoxy functional chlorosilane. It should be noted there can also be used a completely alkoxylated silane or monoalkoxy silane or dialkoxymonoalkylsilane depending on the type of product desired.These intermediates are taken and there is bubbled ammonia through them. Preferably, the temperature of reaction is kept fromO to 600C. if it is desired to obtain a high yield of the lower molecular weight silyl nitrogen compounds. If the temperature is raised above 600C., then a higher percentage of the higher molecular weight silyl nitrogen compounds are obtained. Also, the reactant, i.e., the silane may be dissolved in a common solvent that is utilized in such reactions. Examples of such solvents are organic, hydrocarbon solvents ether solvents such as dioxane, furane chloroaliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as trichloroethylene aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as xylene, toluene, benzene and aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane, heptane, etc.A sufficient amount of solvent is utilized to dissolve the chlorosilane so that the ammonia can be completely bubbled through the solution. It must be appreciated that while the description above has been with respect to chlorosilanes, other types of halosilanes may be utilized as reactants however, the chlorosilanes are the most readily available. The reaction generally takes place for a period of time varying from 2 to 12 hours and more preferably from 4 to s hours, and depending on how much ammonia gas is utilized and the stoichiometry of the reaction, there will be obtained different types of silyl nitrogen compounds linear or branch chained. If linear non cyclic silazane compounds are desired, then preferably there is utilized a certain amount of the monochlorosilanes as well as the dichlorosilanes. Depending on the amount of the ammonia that is bubbled through the mixture, the temperature of reaction and most importantly the stoichiometry of the reactants there can be obtained different types of silyl nitrogen compounds.As noted before, if the temperature is kept below 600C.and the appropriate stoichiometry is used, most of the compounds that will be yielded will be disilazane compounds.If higher temperatures are utilized, there will be larger amounts obtained of the higher silyl nitrogen compounds.Further, if elevated pressures are used and especially pressures in the range of 10 to 50 psig, then there will be obtained more of the higher silyl nitrogen compounds than is the case when atmospheric pressure is utilized. Accordingly, tie, process variables can be varied to obtain the type of silyl nitrogen which is most desired.For the purpose of the instant process, or for ease of synthesizing as well as for suitability in the instant invention, the most desirable silazane compounds are the ones with the lowest molecular weight, and, accordingly, the simplest to obtain, are the disilazane compounds.However, if expense and time is not a factor, then there is no reason why the higher silyl nitrogen compounds may not be obtained. With respect to the obtainment of the cyclic silazane compound as distinguished from the linear silazane compounds, then again the same rules apply except that the reactants are strictly dichlorosilanes. Ammonia is bubbled through the reaction mixture once the alkoxylated product is dissolved in one of the organic solvents disclosed above, and the pressure and the temperature may be varied in accordance with the above limitations and definitions to obtain more of the cyclotrisilazane, or more of the higher cyclic silazanes if desired. That is, if the temperature is maintained at 600C.or below, and the pressure is atmospheric pressure, then there will be obtained more of the cyclotrisilazane. If higher pr.essures are utilized and the temperature is raised above 600C. in the process, there will be obtained considerably more of the higher cyclicsilazanes. As noted previously, the prefrrcyvlic silazanes in the instant invention are the cyclic trisilazanes and the cyclic tetrasilazanes. Accordingly, unless there is some other reason why the higher cyclic silazanes are desired, then the cyclic trisilazanes and cyclic tetrasilazanes can be synthesized by the most inexpensive procedure and may be utilized in the instant process. Another point to be made is that in the production of cyclic silazanes there will normally be produced a mixture of cyclic silazanes in which most of the mixture is comprised of cyclic trisilazanes and cyclic tetrasilazanes and the rest are the higher cyclic silazanes. In such a situation, it is desirable to use the entire mixture of the cyclic silazanes as scavengers or integrated scavengers and cross linkers in the instant case rather than to go to the expense and process of purifying and separating the individual cyclic silazanes and using them individually in the instant case. It is only necessary to know in terms of functionality what the alkoxy content of the mixture is, This will be obtained by knowing the alkoxy content of the reactant. It should also be appreciated that if it is desired to have cyclic silazanes having units in them of Formulas 2 and 3 , then desirably, there is reacted an alkoxylated dichloro silane with a non alkoxy 12ted silane in the specified proportions.It should be noted that in this application, unless specified otherwise, hydrocarbonoxy and alkoxy are utilized interchangeably both terms being utilized to define a hydrocarbon oxygenated group substituent group. The above processes as have been described above, can be followed by a worker skilled in the art to produce analkoxysilazane compound of the instant case. However, for more background in this area of producing silazane compounds, one is referred to the disclosure of British patent No. 1,581,856, which relates to the production of alkoxysilazane compounds.However, the disclosure of these references is meant to be given as background since in one case the disclosure does not relate to hydrocarbonoxysilazane compounds, and in the other case, the process is directed to specific types of hydrocarbonoxy silazane compounds. As noted, such silazane compounds may be utilized as scavengers with an already formed alkoxyterminated diorganopolysiloxane polymer which is preferably formed by reacting a silanol terminated diorganopolysiloxane polymer with a cross linking agent such as methylt rimethoxy ilane in the presence of an amine and preferably in the presence of n dihexylamine which catalyzes the endcapping of the polymer. Once the endcapped polymer is formed, then the scavenging silazane compounds of the instant case can be added as scavengers solely in the specified amounts either before all of the other ingredients are added or with the other ingredients so as to bond or tie up unbonded hydroxy groups in the compound mixture. Alternatively, the scavenging and integrated crosslinking compounds of the instant case can be added to the base silanol endstopped diorganopolysiloxane polymer either alone so as to endcap the polymer or together into other ingredients so as to produce the desired endcapped polymer, i.e., the polymer that is endcapped with alkoxy groups preferably at least two alkoxy groups in most cases and in which the scavenging also ties up all unbonded hydroxy groups in the con pound mixture. Once this has been accomplished the composition can be packaged in substantially anhydrous state and is ready to be utilized by the consumer or in industry as the case may be.There will now be a recitation of the compositions of the White et al. case and the various types of compositions defined in theWhite et al. patent application, Docket 13,275, SerialNo. 277,524, filed June 26, 1981. This recitation is given to define all of the areas in which the present scavenging and scavenging cross linking agents may be utilized and all the different alkoxy functional one component, RTV compositions that the present scavenging or scavenging and integrated cross linkers may be utilized as concerns the RTV compositions of White et al. The base silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane has the formulaEMI34.1 where R is a C1 13 monovalent substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radical, which is preferably methyl, or a mix ture of a major amount of methyl and a minor amount of phenyl, cyanoethyl, trifluoropropyl, vinyl, and mixtures thereof and n is an integer having a value of from about 50 to about 2500, with a cross linking silane having tydrolyzable radicals attached to silicon. As utilized herein, the term stable as applied to the one package polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane RTV s of the present invention means a moisture curable mixture capable of remaining substantially unchanged while excluded from atmospheric moisture and which cures to a tack free elastomer after an extended shelf period. In addition, a stable RTV also means that the tack free time exhibited by freshly mixed RTV ingredients under atmos pheric conditions will be substantially the same as that exhibited by the same mixture of ingredients exposed to atmospheric moisture after having been held in a moisture resistant and moisture free container for an extended shelf period at ambient conditions, or an equivalent period based on accelerated aging at an elevated temperature. The present invention is based on the discovery that stable, substantially acid free, one package, moisture curable polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane RTV compositions can be made by using a silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane consisting essentially of chemically combined diorganosiloxy units of the formulaEMI35.1 such as a silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane of Formula 6 , where R is as previously defined, with an effective amount of certainsi e scavengers for chemically combined hydroxy radicals. In the silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane consisting essentially of chemically combined Formula 7 units, the presence of silicon bonded C18 alkoxy radicals such as methoxy radical is not precluded.The hydroxy radicals which can be removed by the silazane scavenger can be found in materials normally present in the RTV composition of the present invention, for example, trace amounts of water, methanol, silanol radicals on the silica filler if used , the silanol polymer of Formula 6 , or a silanol terminated polymer having Formula 7 units. Among the ingredients of the RTV compositions which are formed as a result of the use of the hydroxy scavenger of Formulas 1 to 5 , is silanol free polydiorganosiloxane, chain terminated with two or three OR10 radicals.The silanol free polydiorganosiloxane optionally can be combined with an effective amount of a cross linking silane, as defined hereinafter, under substantially anhydrous conditions. The cross linking polyalkoxysilane which can be utilized in combination with the scavenging silazneof Formulas I to 5 has the formula,EMI36.1 where 21, R are as defined below and b is O or 1. The pre fersed condensation catalysts which can be used in the practice of the invention include metal compounds selected from tin compounds, zirconium compounds, and titanium compounds or mixtures thereof. Additional condensation catalysts which can be used are defined more particularly hereinafter. It is not completely understood why the polyalkoxyterminated organopolysiloxane compositions of the present invention are stable in the presence of certain condensation catalysts over an extended period of time in the substantial absence of moisture. A mechanistic study of the RTV of the present invention supports the theory that the use of scavenging silazane of Formulas 1 5 above, in accordance with the practice of the invention, minimize the likelihood that detrimental amounts of RAZOR will be generated during the shelf period. RAZOR generation is to be avoided because RAZOR endstops the silanol polymer of Formula 6 or polymer with Formula 7 units to produce polymers having terminal units.EMI37.1 These polymers, wherein the silicon atom at each polymer chain end is terminated with only one alkoxy radical, have slow cure times. In addition, R1OH can breakdown the organopolysiloxane polymer in the presence of the condensation catalyst. The use of silazane scavenger substantially eliminates undesirable water in the filler and silicone polymer, as well as residual moisture in the RTV composition during the shelf period. In determining what level of silane scavenger of Formulas 1 5 to use in the practice of the invention, the total hydroxy functionality of the RTV composition can be estimated. The total hydroxfunctionality of the polymer can be determined by infrared analysis. In order to insure that an effective or stabilizing amount of scavenger is used to maintain the stability of the composition over an extended shelf period of six months or more at ambient temperature while in a sealed container, there can be used an additional amount of scavenger over that amount required to ends top the polymer.This excess of scavenger can be up to about 3 by weight, based on the weight of the polymer. The aforementioned 3 of scavenger by weight exceeds that amount required to substantially eliminate available hydroxy functionality in the polyr as a result of reaction between OH functionality and silazane radicals. In compositions which also contain filler and other additives, the additional amount of scavenger of Formulas I 5 which is required is estimated by running a 48 hour stability check at 1000C. to determine whether the tack free time remains substantially unchanged as compared to the tack free time of the composition before aging measured under substantially the same conditions. Where polyalkoxy terminated polymer of Formula 9 below is made without usingsilazane scavenger of Formulas 1 5 , silazane scavenger can be used in the practice of the invention having less than two OR10 radicals but at least one attached to silicon. In such situations, the scavenging silazanes of Formulas 1 5 can be used in an amount sufficient to stabilize the RTV composition as previously defined. In addition, there can be used with scavengers of Formulas 1 5 at least 0.01 part and up to 10 parts of the cross linking silane ofFormula 8 . The polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane of the present invention has the formula,EMI39.1 are as defined below and where R, RÚ, Rê , n and b are as previously defined and e is equal to O to 1 and the sum of b e is equal toO to 1, and X is a silazane leaving group.The po lyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane of Formula 9 can be made by various procedures. One procedure is taught by Cooper et al., U.S. Patent 3,542,901 involving the use of a polyalkoxysilane with a silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane in the presence of an amine catalyst.A method not taught by Cooper et al. is the use of the silane scavengers of Formulas 1 5 as an endcapper which silazane compounds have at least three hydrocarbonoxy groups with silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane used in the practice of the invention. In Formulas 6 9 , R is preferably selected fromC1 13 monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, halogenated hydrocarbon radicals and cyano alkyl radicals, RÚ is preferably a C1 8 alkyl radical or a C7 13 aralkyl radical, Rê is preferably methyl, phenyl, or vinyl. The expression substantially acid free with respect to defining the elastomer made from the RTV composition of the present invention upon exposure to atmospheric moisture means yielding by products having a pKa of 5.5 or greater with 6 or greater preferred and 10 or greater being particularly preferred. It has been further found that improved cure rates can be achieved if minor amounts of amine S, substituted guanidines, or mixtures thereof, are utilized curing accelerators in the polyalkoxy compositions of the present invention. These curing accelerators also serve to catalyze the ability of thesilazane leaving group to act as a scavenger.There can be used from 0.1 to 5 parts, and preferably from about .3 to 1 part of curing accelerator, per 100 parts of the silanol terminated polymer of Formula 6 , or which consists of chemically combined units of Formula 7 , or 100 parts of the polyalkoxy terminated polymer of Formula 9 to substantially reduce the tack free time TFT of the RTV composition of the present invention. This enhanced cure rate is maintained after it has been aged for an extended shelf period, for example, 6 months or more at ambient tempera tures, or a comparable period under accelerated aging conditions.Its cure properties after the extended shelf period will be substantially similar to its initial cure properties, for example, tack free time TFT , shown by the RTV composition upon being freshly mixed and immediately exposed to atmospheric moisture. The RTV compositions of the present invention can cure to a depth of I a inch thickness within 24 hours.Durometer Hardness Shore A can then be determined and used to evaluate. the cure of the compositions as shown in the examples In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a stable room temperature vulcanizable polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane composition curable under ambient conditions to a tack free, substantially acid free elastomer comprising, A 100 parts of a polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane of Formula 9 B 0.1 to 10 parts of a cross linking silazane of Formula 8 C an effective amount of condensation catalyst, and D a stabilizing amount of scavenging silane of Formula 1 5 . Also included within the scope of the present invention is a method of making a room temperature vulcanizable organopolysiloxane composition under substantially anhydrous conditions utilizing an effective amount of a condensation catalyst with a silanol terminated organopolysiloxane and a polyalkoxysilane cross linking agent, the improvement which comprises 1 adding to the silanol terminated organopolysiloxane a stabilizing amount of a polyalkoxysilazane which is both a scavenger for hydroxy functional groups and B cross linking agent of the Formula 1 5 wherein there is present at least three or four hydrocarbonoxy groups in the molecule of the compound as explained above. Another method of the present invention is making a room temperature vulcanizable organopolysiloxane composition under substantially anhydrous conditions utilizing an effective amount of a condensation catalyst with an organopolysiloxane wherein the silicon atom at each polymer chain end is terminated with at least two alkoxy radicals, which involves the improvement which comprises adding to said polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane 1 a stabilizing amount of a silazane scavenger for hydroxy functional groups of Formulas I 5 . In an additional aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of making a stable, onepackage room temperature vulcanizable polyalkoxyterminated organopolysiloxane composition which comprises agitating, under substantially anhydrous conditions, a room temperature vulcanizable material selected from A a mixture comprising on a weight basis i 100 parts of a silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane consisting essentially of chemically combined units of Formula 7 ii an amount of silazane of Formulas 1 5 sufficient to scavenge available OB in the RTV composition and provide up to 3 by weight excess, based on the weight ofRTV composition, iii O to 10 parts of the cross linking silane of Formula 8 iv an effective amount of a condensation catalyst, and v 0 to 5 parts of curing accelerator selected from substituted guanidines, Amznes and mixtures thereof wherein, the condensation catalyst is added after the silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane and scavenging silazane are mixed and B a mixture comprising, i 100 parts of the polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane of Formula 9 ii 0 to 10 parts of the cross linking silane of Formula 8 iii an effective amount of a condensation catalyst iv a stabilizing amount of silazane scavenger of Formula I 5 , and v 0 to 5 parts of curing accelerator selected from substituted guanidines, amines and mixtures thereof. Radicals included within R of Formulas 6 , 7 , 8 9 are, for example, aryl radicals and halogenated aryl radicals, such as phenyl, tolyl, chlorophenyl, naphthyl aliphatic and cycloaliphatic radicals, for eample, cyclohexyl, cyclobutyl alkyl and alkenyl radicals, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, chloropropyl, vinyl, allyl, triflGoropropyl and cyanoalkyl radicals, for example, cyanoethyl, cyanopropyl, cyanobutyl.Radicals preferably included with R1 are, for example, C18 alkyl radicals, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl C7 13 aralkyl radicals, for example, benzyl phenethyl alkylether radicals such as 2 methoxyethyl alkylester radicals, for example 2 acetoxyethyl alkylketone radicals, for example l butan 3 onyl alkylcyano radicals, for example 2 cyanoethyl. Radicals included within R2 are the same or different radicals included within R radicals. In Formulas 6 9 , where R, R1, and R2 can be more than I radical, these radicals can be the same or different. Some of the cross linking polyalkoxysilanes included within Formula 8 are, for example, methyl trLmethoxysilanei methyltriethoxysilane ethyltrimethoxysilane tetraethoxysilane vinyltrimethoxy silane etc. Among the curing accelerators which can be used in the practice of the invention are silyl substituted guanidines having the formula, 10 Z gSi ORÚ 4 g where R1 is as previously defined, Z is a guanidine radical of the formula,EMI46.1 R3 is divalent C2 8 alkylene radical, R4 and R5 are selected from hydrogen and C1 8 alkyl radicals and.g is an integer equal to I to 3 inclusive. In addition, alkyl substituted guanidines having the formulaEMI46.2 where R4 and R5 are as previously defined and 26 is a C18 alkyl radical, also can be employed. Some of the silyl substituted guanidines included within Formula 10 are shown by Takago, U.S. Patents 4,180,642 and 4,248,993. In addition to the above substituted guanidines, there can be used various amines, for example, di nhexylamine, dicyclohexylamine, di n octylamine, hexamethoxymethylmelamine, and silylated airLines, for example, y aminopropyltrimethQxysilane and methyldimethoxy di n hexylaminosilane. Methyldimethoxy di n hexylaminosilane acts as both a scavenger and curing accelerator. The primary amines, secondary amines, silylated secondary amines are preferred, and secondary amines, and silylated secondary amines are particularly preferred.Silylated secondary amines such as alkyldialkoxy n dialkylamino it lanes and guanidines such as alkyldialkoxyalkylguanidylsilanes which are useful as cure accelerators herein also act as scavengers and, in certain instances, as stabilizers in the compositions of this invention. Silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxanes ofFormula 6 , as well as silanol terminated silicone polymers consisting essentially of Formula 7 units are well known and preferably have a viscosity in the range of from about 100 to about 400,000 centipoise and more preferred from about 1000 to about 250,000 centipoise when measured at about 25 C. These silanol terminated fluids can be made by treating a higher molecular weight organopolysiloxane, such as dimethylpolysiloxane with water in the presence of a mineral avid, or base catalyst, to tailor the viscosity of the polymer to the desired range.Methods for making such higher molecular weight organopolysiloxane utilized in the production of silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane of Formula 6 , or having chemically combined Formula 7 units, also are well know. Effective amounts of the condensation catalysts which can be used in the practice of the present invention to facilitate the cure of the RTV compositions are, for example, 0.001 to 1 part based on the weight of 100 parts of the silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane of Formula 1 . There are included tin compounds, for example, dibutyltindilaurate dibutyltindiacetate dibutyltindimethoxide carbomethoxyphenyl tin tris uberate tin octoate isobutyl tin triceroate dimethyl tin dibutyrate dimethyl tin di neodeconoate triethyl tin tartrate dibutyl tin dibenzoate tin oleate tin naphthenate butyltintri 2 ethylhexoate tinbutyrate. The preferred condensation catalysts are tin compounds and di butyltindiacetate is particularly preferred. Titanium compounds which can be used are, for example, 1,3 propanedioxytitanium bis ethylacetoacetate 1,3 propanedioxytitanium bis acetylacetonate diisopro poxytitanium bis acetylacetonate titanium naphthenate tetrabutyltitanate tetra 2 ethylhexyltitanate tetraphenyltitanate tetraoctadecyltitanate ethyltriethano laminetitanate. In addition beta dicarbonyltitanium com pounds as shown by Weyenberg, U.S. Patent 3,334,067 can be used as condensation catalysts in the present invention. Zirconium compounds, for example, zirconium octoate, also can be used. Further examples of metal condensation catalysts are, for example, lead 2 ethyloctoate iron 2 ethylhexoate cobalt 2 ethylhexoate manganese 2 ethylhexoate zinc 2 ethylhexoate antimony octoate bismuth napthenate zinc naphthenate zinc stearate. Examples of nonmetal condensation catalysts are hexylammonium acetate and benzyltrimethylamrnonium acetate. Various fillers and pigments can be incorporated in the silanol or alkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane, such as for example, titanium dioxide, zirconium silicate, silica aerogel, iron oxide, diatomaceous earth, fumed silica, carbon black, precipitated silica, glass fibers, polyvinyl chloride, ground quartz, calcium carbonate, etc.The amounts of filler used can obviously be varied within wide limits in accordance with the intended use. For example, in some sealant applications, the curable compositions of the present invention can be used free of filler. In other applications, such as the employment of the curable compositions for making binding material on a weight basis, as much as 700 parts or more of filler, per 100 parts of organopolysiloxane can be employed. In such applications, the filler can consist of a major amount of extending materials, such as ground quartz, polyvinylchloride, or mixtures thereof, preferably having an average particle size in the range of from about 1 to 10 microns. The compositions of the present invention also can be employed as construction sealants and caulking compounds.The exact amount of filler, therefore, will depend upon such factors as the application for which the organopolysiloxane composition is intended, the type of filler utilized that is, the density of the filler and its particle size . Preferably, a proportion of from 10 to 300 parts of filler, which can include up to about 35 parts of a reinforcing filler, such as fumed silica filler, per 100 parts of silanol terminated organopolysiloxane is utilized. In the practice of the invention, the room temperature vulcanizable compositions can be made by agitating, for example stirring, a mixture of materials which can consist of the silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane, which hereinafter will include Formula 6 or polymer consisting essentially of Formula 7 units along with the scavenging silazane of Formulas 1 5 and cross linking silane of Formula 8 with the catalyst, or without the crosslinking silane if there is used an integrated crosslinking agent scavenger where the blending is performed in the substantial absence of atmospheric moisture.Thereafter, the condensation catalyst is added also in the substantial absence of atmospheric moisture. As used hereinafter, the expressions moisture free conditions and substantially anhydrous conditions, with reference to making the RTV compositions of the present invention, mean mixing in a dry box, or in a closed container which has been subjected to vacuum to remove air, which thereafter is replaced with a dry inert gas, such as nitrogen. Experience has shown that sufficient scavenging silazane of Formulas 1 5 should be utilized as previously defined. Temperatures can vary from about 0 0C. to about 1800C. depending upon the degree of blending, the type and amount of filler. A preferred procedure for making the RTV composition of the present invention is to agitate under substantially anhydrous conditions, a mixture of the silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane, filler and an effective amount of an integrated cross linkerscavenging silazane of Formulas 1 5 sufficient to effect the substantial elimination of hydroxy functional radicals and to endcap the polymer. There then can be added to the substantially silanol free mixture, the condensation catalyst along with other ingredients, for example, the curing accelerator and pigments. A stabilizing excess of the scavenging silnzanecan be used in the initial or final stages of the mixing procedure if desired in amounts previously defined. In instances where the polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane of Formula 7 is made by a procedure not requiring the use of scavenging silane of Formulas 1 5 , stabilizing amounts of scavenging silazane shown byFormulas 1 5 can be used. Rere, the scavenging siL ee can be added before, with, or after the addition of condensation catalyst. Alternative procedures for making polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane are shown by Cooper et al., U.S. Patent 3,542,901. One thing should be noted that the guanidine and amine accelerators may be utilized optionally in the instant case i.e., the shelf stability and cure rate is improved by the utilization of the accelerators, that is the guanidines, amines, etc. as disclosed above, but the composition will function effectively even without such accelerators. Accordingly, even if those accelerators yield an improved composition, they are not strictly necessary with the integrated cross linkers and scavengers of the instant case. The examples given below are given for the purpose of illustrating the present invention. They are not given for any purpose of setting limits or boundaries to the instant invention. All parts in the examples are by weight.Example I Into a three liter, three necked flask fitted with mechanical stirrer thermometer, reflux condenser and gas inlet tube, there was charged 600 parts of methylchlorodimethoxysilane and 2.0 liters of dry hexane. Ammonia gas was then bubbled through the reaction mixture with agitation until the reaction was completed at room temperature. Azn aorium chloride was removed by vacuum filtration and the product was washed with hexane.The hexane solution of the product as well as the hexane wash were combined and the resulting solution was vacuum distilled on a flash rotary evaporator to yield the desired product dimethyltetramethoxydisilazane. The product was finally distilled at 66 68 C. at 5 mm Hg to yield 334 grams of the clear disilazane. There was then prepared a one component RTV mixture.First, there was mixed at 15 minutes at room temperature, 100 parts of a silanol terminated diorganopolysiloxane polymer of 3,000 centipoise viscosity at 250C. to . which was added .35 parts of n dihexylamine, 3.0 parts of dimethyltetrarnethoxydisilazane and 0.1 to 0.5 parts of methyltriacetoxysilane. To this first mixture, there was added and mixed into it for fifteen minutes, .25 parts of dibutyltindiacetate and 1.0 parts of a trimethylsiloxy endstopped dimethylpolysiloxane fluid of 50 centipoise viscosity at 250C. This fluid was a plasticizer. After mixing, the RTV composition was packed into sealed alumi num tubes and stored for twenty four hours at 1000C and forty eight hours at 1000C. prior to exposure to room temperature curing. Speed and degree of cure were determined by tack free time.The results are set forth in Table 1 below. The results are given for the different levels of methyl triacetoxysilane that was utilized in the composition. The methyltriacetoxysilane was utilized as an endcapping catalyst in the composition as is explained in co pending Chung Docket, 6OSi 613. The results are set forth in Table 1 below. TABLE 1 TFT min. Level g. 1000 24 100 48 CR3Si OAc 3 Initial R.T. 24 hrs. hours hours 0 15 Gelled 15 0.1 15 30 10 30 0.2 45 40 15 0.3 45 40 15 0.4 45 40 15 0.5 45 40 15Example 2 Following the procedure of Example 1, there was then mixed 100 parts of a silanol endstopped dimethylpolysiloxane polymer of 3,000 centipoise viscosity at 25 0C. which was endcapped with dimethoxy groups for the most part and and in which there was present .3 parts of n dihexylamine as a curing accelerator, 1.0 parts of dimethyltetramethoxy disilazane as the integrated cross linker and scavenging agent ,.1 parts of methyltriacetoxy silane as the condensation catalyst, .25 parts of dibutyltindiacetate, and 1.0 parts of the trimethylsiloxy endstopped dimethylpolysiloxane fluid of 50 centipoise viscosity at 250C. of Example 1. Lt should be noted that the fluid of this example which was the sa rne as that of Example 1 contained anywhere from 100 to 500 ppm of silanol in it as 2 re sult of the procedure by which it was mace. Desirably, it should contain no silanol in it. However, by most procedures by which this fluid is obtained, the result is the fact that such fluids do contain some silanol in them.This is one of the reasons why it is necessary to include a scavenger in such compositions. The same compound and procedure was utilized as in Example 1 in this case.After the composition was obtained, then it was subjected to determining tack free time, both with and without a silazane. This test with and without a silazane was to determine the effectiveness of methyltriacetoxysilane as a catalyst in the endcapping reaction, i.e., the endcapping of the silanol endstopped dimethylpolysiloxane polymer with the integrated cross linking agent scavenger, dimethyltetramethoxydisilazane. Normally, an amine is utilized as the endcapping catalyst as was explained above and is explained in the White et al. Docket RD 13,275, SerialNo. 277,524, filed on June 26, 1981, but in this case the use of n dihexylamine was tested as contrasted with the use of methyltriacetoxysilane as a catalyst in the endcapping reaction. As noted from the data below, the initial sample and the accelerated aged sample, both types of endcapper catalyst yielded compositions with good shelf aging. That is, the composition had a good tack free time irrespective of which endcapping catalyst was utilized.With respect to the instant invention, there is disclosed that the instant endcapping scavenger can be utilized both as an integrated crosslinking agent and as a scavenger and will result in a composition with shelf aging properties. Tack free time is a measure of the shelf stability of the composition since if the composition has a good tack free time, i.e., a tack free time that gives the composition a good work life, the composition will still cure in a reasonable amount of time such that the period of time does not exceed 90 minutes. Such a composition as stated has a good work life but will cure in an appropriate period of time after accelerated shelf aging so as to be considered a shelf stable composition. Example 3 There was taken a three liter, three necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser and gas inlet tube which was charged with 2 liters of dry hexane and 500 g of vinylchlorodimethoxysilane. Ammonia gas was then bubbled through the reaction mixture with agitation until the reaction was completed at room temperature. Ammonium chloride was removed by vacuum filtration and the product was washed with hexane. The hexane of the reaction mixture as well as the washed hexane were combined and then the hexane was distilled off in a flash rotaty evaporator to yield a cured pale yellow liquid of 327 parts by weight which distilled at 240C. at 4 mm of Hg. This material was divinyltetramethoxydisilazane. Such a material was taken and compounded into a onecomponent RTV composition. Such composition was prepared by first taking and mixing for fifteen minutes at room temperature, 100 parts of the silanol endstopped dimethylpolysiloxane polymer of Example 1, .3 parts of n dihexylamine and 2 to 4 parts as indicated in theTable I below of divinyltetramethoxydisilazane. To this first mixture which was mixed for fifteen minutes at room temperature, there was added a second mixture which set for fifteen minutes at room temperature, containing .2 parts of dibutyltinacetate and .8 parts of a trimethylsiloxy endstopped dimethylpolysiloxane fluid of 50 centipoise viscosity at 250C. which is present as plasticizer.The two mixing steps in both Example 1, 2 and the present example, are necessary because the dibutyltindiacetate will cause an undesirable increase in viscosity if it is added during the first step. This viscosity increase is the result of some silanol condensation catalyzed by the dibutyltindiacetate. This does not occur if the chain capping agent is waded first and allowed to react. The results of both initial and accelerated tackfree time are shown in Table II below.

It is felt that the residual stearic acid present on the calcium carbonate filler is sufficient to catalyze the chain capping reaction by the CE3Si CH3 2I2 N H. The application rates extrusion rates of sealants prepared in Examples 4 and 5 were 80 grams per minute and 65 grams per minute respectively thus, indicating the absence of gellation.

Example 7 There was taken a three lter, three necked flask fitted with a mechanical server, thermometer, reflux condenser and gas inlet tube which was charged with two liters of dry hexane and 437 g. of methyl dichloromethoxy silane. Ammonia gas was then bubbled through the reaction mixture with good agitation until the reaction was completed at room temperature. Ammonium chloride removed by vacuum filtration, and the product, was washed with hexane from the ammonium filter cake.

This mixture was agitated under vacuum 22 mm Hg at room temperature for two hours to give an RTV base. To this base was added 0, 0.5, and 1.0 parts of thelinear methoxy silazane above, 1.0 parts 3 2 aminoethyl amino propyltrimethoxysilane, and 0.5 part methyltrimethoxysilane. Following a 15 minute mix at room temperature using a SemSi X mixer, a solution comprised of 1 part 3 2 amino ethylaminoMpropyltrimethoxysilane and .2 parts of dibutyltindiacetate was added to the RTV composition followed by a second 15 minute mix at room temperature using a SemKi mixer. Following mixing, the material was placed in sealed aluminum tubes and stored for 24 hours at room temperature, and 48 hours at 1000C. After aging, the material was made into ASTM sheets and allowed to cure three days at room temperature and 50 relative humidity. After curing, a physical property profile to illustrate the properties of the composition. The flow rate of the uncured mixture was tested with a flow test jig as described in military specification MIL A 46106A.
