## Description
Oxytetracyclin solutions The invention relates to injectable solutions of oxytetracyclin and their preparation. Oxytetracyclin OTC as such is not stable in aqueous solution. Moreover, it is badly soluble in water. Acceptable solutions can be obtained by addition of certain excipients. It is known, for instance, that by addition of magnesium compounds a magnesium complex is formed which better dissolves than oxytetracyclin itself. It is further known to improve the solubility by addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP and or organic solvents. Preparations with magnesium and PVP, as described in Dutch patent 134511, are found to be very satisfactory in practice. Their only disadvantage is that the oxytetracyclin content is restricted by the limitation which is put in practice to the viscosity.With a content of 10 or more the viscosity increases to such an extent that the application is hampered. There is a need, however, for preparations with a higher concentration of oxytetracyclin for veterinary purposes. In the first place because one prefers to keep the injection volume as small as possible particularly important for animals with a weight of more than 100 kg and second because it has been found that when using higher dosages with more concentrated solutions a considerable longer therapeutical effect is achieved. Up till now it was only possible to prepare solutions with higher oxytetracyclin concentration with low viscosity by using certain organic solvents such as propylene glycol, dimethylacetamide, 2 pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and Nmethylpyrrolidone, to which solvents sometimes PVP also was added. Such solutions are described in British patent 1.427.882, Dutch patent application 7804455, Belgian patent 861885, German patent applications 2001604, 2501805 and 3104233 and U.S. patent 4.018.889. All the solvents used have the strong disadvantage that they cause a strong tissue irritation on the site of the injection, which even can lead to visible abnormalities in the meat on this place with a accompanying loss of value. When PVP is applied, a type is preferably chosen with a mean molecular weight between 10,000 and 40,000. It has now been found that one can reach higher concentrations of oxytetracyclins with a good stability, an acceptable viscosity and a minimal tissue irritation by using PVP with a relatively low molecular weight. The invention is characterized in that in aqueous oxytetracyclin solutions with a pH of 8 9.5, which contain a magnesium compound and PVP, one applies PVP with a molecular weight between 500 and 10,000, preferably between 1000 and 5000. The PVP concentration is preferably at least 18t w v because solutions can thus be obtained which contain 10 or more percent by weight of oxytetracyclin. According to the invention, solutions can be obtained with OTC up to 20D w v .For that, maximally 40Z w v of PVP is needed. The kind and the amount of magnesium compound can be the same as described in Dutch patent specification 134.511. Magnesium oxide and magnesium chloride 6aq are for instance suitable. The invention also includes the preparation of oxytetracyclin solutions by dissolving oxytetracyclin as salt or as a base with a suitable amount of a magnesium compound and PVP and to bring the pH in the range of 8.0 to 9.5, characterized in that PVP is used with a molecular weight between 500 and 10,000. The amount of magnesium compound to be used is preferable 1 to 1.5 mol per mol of oxytetracyclin. The pH can be brought to the desired value with the aid of a physological unharmful base, such as ammonia, ethylenediamine or ethanolamine.In order to promote the stability, the air in bottles or ampoules containing the oxytetracyclin solutions of the invention can be replaced by an inert gas, preferably nitrogen. It is also advantageous for the stability to add to the solution a small amount of a reducing agent, such as sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite or sodium formaldehydesulfoxylate.It was conceivable that substitution of the PVP commonly used in known preparations by PVP of lower molecular weight would lead to tissue irritation. Surprisingly this is not the case.The effect of lowering the molecular weight of PVP on the stability of the injection solution and the level of oxytetracyclin in the blood could not be predicted. It is therefore unobvious that the compositions of the invention possess a satisfactory stability and at higher dosages show a long lasting therapeutic blood level of the oxytetracyclin. An accompanying advantage of the use of low molecular PVP is that the likeness of tumours to be formed, as seen with PVP with higher molecular weight, will be minimal. The preparation of the oxytetracyclin solutions according to the invention is illustrated by the following examples in which the percentages mentioned are weight by volume percents. Example 1Preparation of a 10 oxytetracyclin solution with 18 of polyvinylpyrrolidone K value 11 14 Under a nitrogen atmosphere the following was added successively to 200 ml of pyrogen free water 90 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone K value 11 14, molecular weight 2000 3500 , 3 g of sodium formaldehydesulfoxylate, 4.34 g of magnesium oxide, 11 g of ethanolamine, and a solution of 56.7 g of oxytetracyclin hydrochloride in 100 ml of pyrogen free water. After being stirred for some time, a clear solution was formed. The solution was made up to 500 ml with pyrogen free water, which gave a solution with a pH of 8.7 and a viscosity of 17 centipoise at 220C. The solution contained 100 mg of oxytetracyclin per ml. This solution was filtered through a sterilizing filter after which stability studies were carried out. At 50 C the solution was stable for 3 to 4 weeks, but at 37 C the solution even remained stable after 6 months. As a test for the stability of the solution the absence of a precipitate was used. Example 2Preparation of a 10X oxytetracyclin solution with 20 of polyvinylpyrrolidone K value 11 14 Under a nitrogen atmosphere the following was added successively to 200 ml of pyrogen free water 100 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone K value 11 14 , molecular weight 2000 3500 , 3 g of sodium formaldehydesulfoxylate, 4.34 g of magnesium oxide, 11 g of ethanolamine and a solution of 56.7 g of oxytetracyclin hydrochloride in 100 ml of pyrogen free water After being stirred for some time a clear solution was formed which was made up to 500 ml of pyrogen free water.

After sterile filtration the solution remained stable for about 8 weeks at 5 C and at 37 C the stability was more than 6 months. After 6 months at 37 C the solution kept its light colour Example 3Preparation of a 10 oxytetracyclin solution with 20 of polyvinylpyrrolidone K value 11 14 starting from oxytetracylin base. a.
