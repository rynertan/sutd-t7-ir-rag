# Differential amplifier having balanced output.

## Abstract
A classical differential amplifier 100 provides output of unequal magnitude due to its emitter resistance being finite. In order to equalize its output, a voltage follower circuit 200, 300 is associated with each of the inputs of the differential amplifier. The output of each voltage follower circuit is converted to a current 202, 302 and subtracted 400, 500 from one of the outputs of the differential amplifier. Subtracting the outputs results in a differential amplifier with both outputs being substantially equal.
