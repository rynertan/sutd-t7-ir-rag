# METHOD FOR STRENTHENING TERMINATIONS ON REDUCTION FIRED MULTILAYER CAPACITORS

## Abstract
The strength of end terminations on multilayer capaci tors employing base metal electrodes is increased by heating the terminations, subsequent to firing in a reducing atmos phere, in an atmosphere in which the oxygen partial pressure is at least equal to that of air for a period of at least 15 minutes at a temperature of 375 C 600 C.
