## Description
Pipette with adjustable volume The present invention is concerned with a pipette provided with a piston, whose dosage volume is adjusted to the desired level by changing the stroke length of the piston. In prior art, many sorts of adjustable piston pipettes are known, for example out of the patent publications FI 57,542 corresponds to GB 2021972 , FI 57,543 corresponds to GB 2,022,453 , and FI 62,470 corresponds to EP 67,605 . These pipettes, however, involve the drawback that the adjustment of the volume is based exclusively on a screw of slow pitch, which is accurate but quite slow in operation. The object of the present invention is to provide a continuously or almost continuously adjustable piston pipette whose volume adjustment is accurate but rapid. The mechanism of adjustment of the pipette of the present invention has two parts a rapid coarse adjustment and a precise fine adjustment. The coarse adjustment acts upon the limiter of one extreme position of the piston and lengthens or shortens the stroke length of the piston stepwise. On the other hand, by means of the fine adjustment, the other limiter of the piston is shifted upwards or downwards. The fine adjustment lengthens or shortens the stroke length by no more than the distance corresponding to the steps of the coarse adjustment.The coarse adjustment is accomplished either so that the outer face of the piston rod is provided with grooves of different lengths and parallel to the rod, of which grooves any one can be positioned on a limiter pin provided on the pipette body and projecting inwards, whereby one end of the groove is closed and determines one of the extreme positions of the piston, or so that the corresponding grooves are provided on the body and the limiter pin on the piston rod. The fine adjustment is accomplished so that the pipette body is provided with a second limiter which, together with a stop member provided at the piston rod, determines the other extreme position of the piston, the distance of the said limiter from the said stop member being adjustable.A recommended fine adjustment mechanism is a limiter flange provided inside the body and determining the lower extreme position of the piston and, as its stop member, a sleeve fitted around the piston rod as moving by means of a threading. When pipetting is performed, the desired volume is first selected by placing the corresponding groove onto the limiter pin. Thereupon, the accurate volume is set by means of the fine adjustment member.The coarse adjustment takes place rapidly, by means of one movement, and in this way the entire setting time becomes shorter than if the whole setting procedure were carried out by means of a fine adjustment member, whose operation is relatively slow. A preferred embodiment of the invention will be illustrated in more detail by means of the attached drawings, wherein Figure I is a sectional side view of the pipette, Figure II shows a section at the level II in Fig. I, Figure III shows a section at the level III in Fig. I, and Figure IV shows the display of the volume of the pipette seen from outside. The pipette comprises a body 1 and a cylinder part 2, which is threaded into the bottom portion of the body and to which a disposable container 3 is attached. by means of a friction joint. Into the cylinder part 2, a piston 4 and its seal ring 5 are fitted. The piston 4 relates to a sleeve 6 and to an extension 7 of the sleeve, the top end of the said extension 7 being provided with a press knob 8. The outer face of the sleeve 6 is provided with grooves 10, 11, 12 and 13 parallel to the piston, having different lengths and extending to the top end 9 of the sleeve.Inside the body 1, there is a limiter pin 14. Around the piston 4, there is a spiral spring 15, which presses the piston to its upper position. In the upper position the limiter pin 14 rests against the bottom end of one of the grooves 10, 11, 12 or 13. The extension 7 of the sleeve is provided with a fine adjustment threading 16 and with a threaded sleeve 17, which is fitted onto the said thread and whose bottom end widens as flange shaped. A ring 18 rests against the bottom flange of the threaded sleeve 17, which said ring 18 is pressed by a spiral spring 19, which is placed around the threaded sleeve and which is stronger than the spring 15, and the top end of the spring 19 is locked in its position by a sleeve 20. Moreover, inside the body 1, there is a limiter flange 21, which determines the lower extreme position of the ring 18. The coarse adjustment of the volume of the pipette is performed by, by means of the knob 8, pressing the piston 4 to its lower position and by, by means of the knob 8, turning the groove 10, 11, 12 or 13 corresponding to the desired volume onto the limiter pin 14. The fine adjustment of the volume is carried out by turning by the sleeve 20, whereby the threaded sleeve 17 is also turned and the distance of the ring 18 from the limiter flange 21 becomes larger or smaller. The sleeve 6 is preferably provided with ten grooves of different lengths, the lengths having equal steps from length to length, whereby an illustrative volume display can be easily constructed for the pipette. At the lower end of the sleeve 6, there is a keyway 58 which rotates the ring 22 when the knob 8 is rotated. On the outer circumference of the ring 22, there are numbers, which can be read through the lower portion of the opening 23 provided in the body 1.This reading indicates the volume corresponding to the groove 10, 11, 12 or 13 that has been set. The sleeve 20 is provided with a keyway 24, which rotates a number ring 25, whereby the numbers marked on the outer circumference of the said ring 25 can be read through the upper portion of the display opening 23. This reading indicates how much the volume indicated by the number ring 22 has been increased by means of fine adjustment. For the purpose of locking the number rings 22 or 25, notches 26 or 27 have been made into their end faces. The notches 26 or 27 are jointly operative with springs 30 and 31 and balls 32 or 33 placed in recesses 28 or 29. The movement of rotation of the number rings 22 or 25 is limited by means of pins 34 or 35 and grooves 36 or 37. The grooves 36 or 37 do not extend around the entire circumference of the rings 22 or 25, and, consequently, the number rings can never revolve an entire full circle. When the knob 8 is being depressed, the piston 4 is first pressed downwards when the spring 15 yields, until the ring 18 meets the limiter flange 21. This stroke length corresponds to the volume to be pipetted.In order to empty the pipette completely, the knob 8 is depressed further with a higher force, whereby the spring 19 yields until the threaded sleeve 17 meets the limiter pin 14.
