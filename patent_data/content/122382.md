# Erosion resistant elbow for solids conveyance.

## Abstract
An elbow 5 and process for fabrication for use in particu late material conveyancing comprising a curved outer pipe 12 , a curved inner pipe 16 having the same radius of curva ture as the outer pipe, concentric with and internal to the outer pipe, comprising an outer layer 20 comprised of a first mater ial and an inner layer 18 comprised of a second material wherein said first material is characterized by high erosion resistance when impinged by particulate material and wherein said second material is characterized by high tensile strength and flexibility, and an inner pipe supporting means for providing support to said inner pipe, disposed between said inner pipe and said outer pipe.
