# Electrical contact member and connector including such contact members.

## Abstract
An electrical contact member comprises a conductive plate 4 having therein a slot 5 open to an edge of the plate 4 , the slot 5 having a mouth 28 at the edge of the plate 4 and leading to a first inwardly tapering section 29 which leads to a second parallel straight sided section 30 , the second section 30 leading into a third inwardly tapering section 31 having convex converging sides leading to a throat 32 which opens into a fourth outwardly tapering section 33 leading into a fifth inwardly tapering section 34 having convex converging sides, the maximum width of the fifth section 34 being less than that of the third section 31 , the fifth section 34 defining a closed end 35 for the slot 5 . When used with a conductor 100 having a stranded core the slot shape of the contact serves to retain the strands in as near as possible their original relative positions, thus ensuring reliable connection.
