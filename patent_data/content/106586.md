# PAINT COLOUR CHANGE SYSTEM

## Abstract
A paint colour change system for supplying paint to a remote spray head 12 uses a paint manifold 34 and suitable valving 36a to c, 44,74 to 80 for supplying paint to either of two supply lines 18 and 20 extending to the spray head to enable one supply line to be flushed with cleaning fluid and filled with paint of a new colour while the other line is supplying paint of another colour. Part of the necessary valving is located at the spray head, and that valving includes pressure regulating valves 76 and 80 controlled by air pilot pressure to accurately regulate the paint pressure and thus the paint flow rate to paint spray devices 16.
