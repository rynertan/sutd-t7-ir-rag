# Tracking control arrangements for use in optical disc players.

## Abstract
A tracking control arrangement for use in an optical disc player comprises a photodetector 13 for receiving a light beam reflected at an optical disc on which an information signal is recorded in a record track, signal generating circuit 14 for generating a reproduced information signal and a tracking error signal from the output of the photodetector 13 , a modifer 23, 24 for modifying the tracking error signal in response to variations in the total quantity of light of the light beam received by the photodetector 13 , driving means 10, 25, 26 for driving an optical device to maintain the light beam in a proper tracking relation to the record track in re sponse to the modified tracking error signal, a detector 31, 32, 33 for detecting a variation in the reproduced information signal resulting from the condition in which the light beam reflected at a blank area in the record track is received by the photodetector 13 , and a gain controller 30 for varying the gain of transmisson of the modifed tracking error signal from the modifier to the driving means in response to a pre determined detection output of the detector 31, 32, 33 .
