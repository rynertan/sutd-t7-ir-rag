## Description
BICYCLO 3.3.0 OCTANE DERIVATIVES This invention relates to new bicyclo 3.3.0 octane derivatives. More particularly, it relates to bicyclo 3.3.0 octane derivatives useful as important intermediates for the preparation of 6,9 methano PGI2 analogues, especially the 5E isomethereof, and to processes for the preparation thereof. 5E 6,9 rnethano PGI2 i.e. carbacyclin is a compound having the following structural formula EMI1.1 Carbacyclin has the same pharmacological properties asPGI2 has, and further has high stability as compared with PGI2, and, therefore, it expected to be developed as a medicine. There have been filed many patent applications relating to SE 6,9 rnethano PGI2 derivatives. In particular SE 15 cyclopentyl 16,17,18,19,20 penta 6,9 methano PGI2 having the following structural formula EMI2.1 has a potent inhibitory activity on platelet aggregation and an excellent protective activity on brain anoxia, and, therefore, may be useful in the treatment of circulatory diseases and in the treatment of anoxia of brain cells see British Patent No. 20176993 DerwentNo. 73954B and German Patent Application No. 3315356.6 . There have also been many proposals relating to processes for the preparation of 5E 6,9 methanoPGI2 and derivatives thereof. However, these processes are not necessarily advantageous for commercial massproduction, and there is still great room for improvement. In the preparation of 5E 6,9 methano PGI2 and derivatives thereof, the known processes which are generally used involve the introduction of upper and lower side chains into various specific bicyclo 3.3.0 octane derivatives represented, as a skeleton compound, by general formula III by using Wittig reactions as shown in the scheme below. Therefore, the bicyclot3.3.0 octane derivative of the formula III is considered to be a very important intermediate for the preparation of SE 6,9 methano PGI2 and derivatives thereof, and thus it is important to use a bicyclo 3.3.0 octane derivative of the formula III which permits good chemical yields to be obtained and allows ease of treatment in commercial mass production.The values of symbols X and Y which appear in the scheme are given in the following discussion of specific intermediates which have hitherto been described X represents various specific carbonylprotecting groups or groups which can be converted to introduce a carbonyl group, Y represents various specific hydroxy protecting groups and Z may represent a variety of substituents. It is to.be understood that not all compounds embraced generally by formula III are known the formula is used to represent certain specific known intermediate compounds which are defined and discussed in more detail hereinafter. Scheme EMI3.1 As bicyclot3.3.O octane derivatives of the formula III, several specific compounds which have various and different carbonyl protecting groups X and of hydroxy protecting groups Y , have been proposed. For example, in the specification of BritishPatent No. 2017699B Derwent No. 73954B , there is disclosed a process which comprises subjecting a compound of the formula EMI4.1 wherein represents a phenyl group to a first Wittig reaction to introduce a lower side chain, converting the acetoxy group attached to the 3 position into a hydroxy group and oxidising the hydroxy group produced to an oxb group to form a ketone, and then subjecting the compound obtained to a second Wittig reaction to introduce an upper side chain. Furthermore, it is disclosed that the compound of the formula IV may be prepared by oxidizing a compound of the formula EMI5.1 wherein pl is as hereinbefore defined. However, in such an oxidation particularly an oxidation using a base such as pyridine , it has been confirmed that a compound formed from the compound of the formula V by elimination of the benzoyl group at the 7 position to form a double bond between C6 and C7 positions is formed as by product in a high proportion of 10 50 . Therefore, it can not be said that the compound of the formula IV having a hydroxy group protected by a benzoyl group at the 7position, is an intermediate suitable for commercial mass production. In the specification of the European PatentPublication No. 11591 Derwent No. 32903C , there is disclosed a process which comprises subjecting a compound of the formula EMI5.2 wherein pl is as hereinbefore defined, to a first Wittig reaction to introduce a lower side chain, then cleaving the ketal to form a ketone. and then introducing an upper side chain by a similar reaction. Furthermore, it is described that the compound of the formula VI may be prepared by the series of reactions depicted below, wherein a is as hereinbefore defined SchemeEMI6.1 However, the catalyst presently used for the debenzylation reaction by hydrogenolysis, is generally palladium on carbon, but it is extremely dangerous to use a large quantity of palladium on carbon in commercial mass production. In addition, the ketal group protecting the ketone group is liable to be cleaved and there is a further possibility of the ketal being cleaved in the course of subsequent reaction steps. Another disadvantage is that the benzoyl group is cleaved in the oxidation step the hydroxy group at the 7 position is protected by a benzoyl group, as in the compound of the formula IV .From the above view point, the intermediate of the formulaVI also is not a compound suitable for commercial massproduction. In addition to the specific compounds mentioned above, various other intermediates of the formula III have been proposed see British Patent Publication Nos.2012265A Derwent No. 54825B , 2013661A Derwent No. 562903 , 2014143A Derwent No. 59839B and 2019847A Derwent No. 66338B , but all of them have some disadvantage from the view point of ease of use, chemical yield andcosts. A suitable intermediate should have protecting groups which are easily cleaved in a cleavage reaction but which otherwise remain attached and unaffected in other reactions and should not give rise to side reactions. As a result of research and experimentation to discover a novel intermediate of the formula III which may be converted to a desired 5E 6,9 methanoPGI2 or analogue thereof with safety, low cost, ease of treatment and high chemical yield, and further without producing side reactions, it has been discovered that a new intermediate of the formula III wherein X represents an acetoxy group and Y represents a tetrahydropyran 2yl group, is surprisingly advantageous. The present invention accordingly provides new bicycld 3.3.0 octane derivatives of the general formula EMI9.1 wherein Ac represents an acetyl group, THP represents a tetrahydropyran 2 yl group and R represents a formyl group or a group of the general formula EMI9.2 in which one of R and R represents a hydroxy group and the other represents a hydrogen atom, or R1 and R2 together represent an oxo group, R3 represents a single bond or a straight or branched chain alkylene group cf 1 to 5 carbon atoms and R represents a straight or branched chain alkyl group of l 1 to 8 carbon atoms, a straight or branched chain alkenyl or alkynyl group of 2 to 8 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group of 4 to 7 carbon atoms, either unsubstituted or substituted by at least one straightor branched chain alkyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms or represents a phenyl group or phenoxy group either unsubstituted or substituted by at least one halogen atom, trifluoromethyl group or straight or branched chain alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and the double bond in formula VIII is E with the proviso that when R3 represents a single bond, R4 does not represent a substituted or unsubstituted phenoxy group , which are useful as intermediates in the preparation of 6,9methano PGI2 and derivatives thereof. In the above structural formulae and in .the other structural formulae in this specification, according to the generally accepted nomenclature, the broken line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is behind the ring plane, i.e. is of the a configuration, the bold line r indicates that the substituent attached thereto is in front of the ring plane, i.e. is of the B configuration, and the wavy lxne indicates that the substituent attached thereto is of the a configuration or the 6 configuration or a mixture thereof. The present invention is concerned with all compounds of general formula VII in the optically active natural form or its enantiomeric form, or mixtures thereof, more particularly the racemic form, consisting of equimolecular mixtures of the optically active natural form and its enantiomeric form. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the compounds depicted in general formula VII have at least five centres of chirality, those five centres of chirality being at the C l, C 3, C 5, C 6 and C 7 carbon atoms. Still further centres of chirality may occur when one of R1 and R2 in the general formula VIII represents a hydroxy group and the other represents a hydrogen atom, and when the grouping R3 R4 in the general formula VIII contains a branched chain alkylene group or represents a branched chain alkyl group. The presence of chirality leads, as is well known, to the existence of isomerism.However, the compounds of general formula VII all have a configuration that the substituent groups attached to the ring carbon atoms in the positions identified as 1 and 5 are cis with respect to each other and that the substituent groups attached to the ring carbon atoms in the positions identified as 5 and 6 are t ns with resptS to each other.Accordingly, all isomers of general fcmnula VII and mixtures thereof which have those substituent groups attached to the ring carbon atoms in positions 1 and 5 in the cis configuration, those attached in positions 5 and 6 in the trans configuration and the acetyl group as depicted in the 3 position and the tetrahydropyran 2 yl group as depicted in the 7 position are to be considered within the scope of general formula VII. In the general formula VIII, as the alkylene group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms represented by R3 there may be mentioned methylene, ethylene, trimethylene, tetramethylene, and pentamethylene and isomers thereof. R3 preferably represents a single bond or a methylene or ethylene group. In the general formula VIII, as the alkylgmup of 1 to 8 carbon atoms or alkenyl or alkynyl group of 2 to 8 carbon atoms represented by R4 ,there may be mentioned methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl1 hexyl, heptyl,and octyl and isomers thereof and the corresponding unsaturated groups containing 2 to 8 carbon atoms, having a double bond or a triple bond then in, butyl, pentyl or hexyl groups optionally having a double bond or a triple bond therein and either unsiiiited or substituted by one or two methyl or ethyl groups are preferred. In the general formula VIII, as the substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl group represented by R4, there may be mentioned cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl groups substituted by one or more methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl or octylgrqps cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl groups either unsubstituted or substituted by one methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl group are preferred. In the general formula VIII, as the substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or phenoxy group represented by R4, there may be mentioned phenyl and phenoxy groups, and phenyl and phenoxy groups substituted by one or more atoms or groups selected from fluorine and chlorine atoms, and trifluoromethyl, methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl groups phenyl or phenoxy groups either unsubstituted or substituted by one chlorine atom, trifluoromethyl group, methyl group or ethyl group are preferred. In the general formula VIII,a6zeSS i groIngs R3 R4, there may be mentioned butyl, pentyl, l methylpentyl, 2 methylpentyl, 3 methylpentyl, l,l dimethylpentyl, l ethylpentyl, 2 ethylpentyl, hexyl, l methylhexyl, 2 methylhexyl, l ethylhexyl, 2 ethylhexyl, heptyl, 2 methylheptyl, 2 ethylheptyl, 4 methylpent 3 enyl, 2,4 dimethylpent 3 enyl, pent 3 ynyl and 1 methylpent 3 ynyl cyclobutyl, l propylcyclobutyl, 1 butylcyclobutyl, 3 ethylcyclobutyl, 3 propylcyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentylmethyl, 2 cyclopentylethyl, 3 ethylcyclopentyl, 3 propylcyclopentyl, 3 butylcyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexylmethyl, 2 cyclohexylethyl, 4 methylcyclohexyl, 4 ethylcyclohexyl, 4 propylcyclohexyl and 4 butylcyclohexyl and also benzyl, 2 phenylethyl, 4 methylbenzyl, 4 ethylbenzyl, phenoxymethyl, 2 phenoxyethyl, 3 chlorophenoxymethyl, 4 chlorophenoxymethyl, 3 trifluoromethylphenoxymethyl, 4 trifluoromethylphenoxymethyl, 4 methylphenoxymethyl and 4 ethylphenoxymethyl cyclopentyl is especially preferred. Further, in the general formula VIII, the preferred configuration of the hydroxy group is the a configuration, when one of R1 and R2 represents a hydroxy group and the other represents a hydrogen atom. Compounds of general formula VII wherein the grouping R R represents a cycloalkyl group of 4 to 7 carbon atoms either unsubstituted or substituted by at least one straight or branched chain alkyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, especially a cyclopentyl group, are especially preferred.According to a feature of the present invention, compounds of the general formula VII wherein R represents the group of the general formula VIII. in which one of R1 and R2 represents a hydroxy group and the other represents a hydrogen atom, i.e. compounds of the general formula EMI14.1 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined may be prepared by reducing a compound of the general formula VII wherein R represents the group of the general formula VIII, in which R and R2 together represent an oxo group, i.e. a compound of the general formula EMI14.2 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined, The reduction to convert the oxo group to a hydroxy group may be carried out by using any suitable reducing reagent such as sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride, lithium borohydride, zinc borohydride, lithium tri tert butoxyaluminium hydride, lithium trimethoxyaluminium hydride. sodium cyanoborohydride, potassium tri sec butylborohydride, lithium aluminium hydride quinine complex, isobornyloxymagnesium iodide in an inert organic solvent a e.g. an alkanol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, or an ether such as tetrahydrofuran.dioxan or 1,2 diethoxyethane. or a mixture of two or more such solvents. at a temperature from 78 C to ambient.Preferably, the reduction is effected using di iso bornyloxyaluminiumisopropoxide described in ourJapanese Patent Xokai No. 54 76552 , or a diisobutyl alkyl substituted or on unsubstituted phenoxyaluminium described in our JapanesePatent Kokai No. 54 154739 and J. Org. Chem., 44, 1363 1979 , or a lithium 1,1 binaphthyl 2.2 dioxyaluminium hydride described in J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 101, 5B3 l979 . The product thus obtained is a mixture of isomers in which the 3 hydroxy group is in a or ss configuration and the mixture, if desired, is separated by conventional means, for example, by thin layer, column or high speed liquid chromatography on silica gel to give the desired isomer of general formulaVIIA. According to a further feature of the invention compounds of the general formula VIIB may be prepared by subjecting to the Wittig reaction a compound of the general formula VII wherein R represents a formyl group, i.e.by reacting a compound of the general formula EMI16.1 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined with a sodium derivative of a dialkyl phosphonate of the general formula EMI16.2 wherein R5 represents an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. preferably methyl or ethyl. and the other symbols are as hereinbefore defined , or with a phosphorane compound of the general formula EMI16.3 wherein R6 represents a phenyl group unsubstituted or substituted by at least one alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably phenyl, or represents an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably butyl or hexyl or represents a cyclohexyl group, and the other symbols are as hereinbefore defined . The sodium derivative of the dialkyl phosphonate of the general formula IX may be prepared by the reaction of the dialkyl phosphonate and sodium hydride. The Wittig reaction is described in OrganicReactions , Volume 14, Chapter 3 1965 , John Wiley Sons, Inc. USA . The reaction may be effected in an inert organic solvent, e.g. an ether such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan or 1,2 dimethoxyethane, a hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene or hexane, a dialkyl sulphoxide such as dimethyl sulphoxide, a dialkylformamide such as N,N dimethylformamide, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or an alkanol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methanol. or ethanol. or a mixture of two or more of them, at a temperature from 780C to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Dialkyl phosphonates of the general formula IX and phosphorane compounds of the general formula X are well known, or may easily be prepared by methods known per se. By the term methods known per se as used in this specification is meant methods heretofore used or described in the chemical literature. Bicyclo 3.3.0 octane derivatives of the general formula VIIC may be prepared by the series of reactions depicted schematically below in Scheme A, wherein 0 represents a phenyl group and the other symbols are as hereinbefore defined. The preparation of the derivatives of general formula VIIC from the compounds of general formula XVI constitutes a feature of the present invention. Scheme AEMI18.1 All of the individual reaction steps in SchemeA may be conducted by methods known per se, and suitable reaction conditions are described in the specification of the British Patent No. 2017699B Derwent No. 73954B .For example. step a 1 the protection of the hydroxy group by the tetrahydropyran 2 yl group, may be conducted by using 2,3dihydropyran in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride in the presence of a condensing agent, e.g.p toluenesulphonic acid or sulphuric acid at a temperature from ambient to 300C, preferably at ambient. The step bi . reduction, may be conducted by means heretofore mentioned for the conversion of compounds of general formula VIIB to those of general formula VI IA suitably it is effected by using sodium borohydride in methanol at a temperature lower than OOC. The product of the general formula XIII thus obtained is a mixture of isomers in which the 3 hydroxy group is in a or ss configuration. However the separation of such mixture is unnecessary because the 3 hydroxy group is converted again into an oxo group in a subsequent reaction step. The step cl, acetylation, may be conducted by using acetic anhydride in the presence of a tertiary amine such as pyridine or triethylamine in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride, or in the absence of the solvent at room temperature. The step d , debromination , may be conducted by gentle refluxing using tributyltin hydride in the presence of ,a azo bisisobutyronitrile in an inert organic solvent such as benzene, toluene or ethyl acetate.The step e , cleavage of the benzyl group, may be generally conducted by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as palladium on carbon, palladium black or platinum dioxide, in an inert organic solvent, for example a lower alkanol such as methanol or ethanol at room temperature at normal or elevated pressure, for example at a hydrogen pressure from atmospheric to 15 kg cm2. Suitably the cleavage may also be conducted by using Raney Nickel catalyst in a lower alkanol such as methanol or ethanol under an atmosphere of an inert gas, for example under an atmosphere of argon gas at a temperature from ambient to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. For the purpose of commercial mass production it is of great significance that Raney Nickel can be used as catalyst from a view point of safety.The step. f . oxidation, may be carried out as described in detail in, for example. a Synthetic Organic Chemistry 1111 OrganicSynthesis 1 , pp. 176 206 compiled by Tetsuji Kametani and published by Nankodo Japan on Aug. 1, 1976 or b Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods , vol. 1, vol. 2. and vol. 3, section 48 or 168 published by John Wiley Sons, Inc. USA in 1971, 1974 and 1977, respectively . me oxidation is preferably carried out under mild neutral conditions using, for example, sulphuric anhydridepyridine complex see J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 89, 5505 1967 , chromium trioxide pyridine complex for example, Collins reagent , Jones reagent or chromic acid solution prqxred from chromium trioxide, manganese sulphate, sulphuric acid and water , or oxalyl chloride and dimethylsulphoxide i.e. Swern oxidation . The oxidation using sulphuric anhydride pyridine complex may be carried out in dimethyl sulphoxide in the presence of triethylamine at room temperature. The Collins oxidation may be conducted in a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform, methylene chloride or carbon tetrachloride at a temperature from room temperature to O C, preferably at O C.The Jones oxidation may be conducted at a temperature of not higher than room temperature. The Swern oxidation may be conducted by reaction in a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform or methylene chloride at a temperature from 50 C to 60 C, and then treatment with triethylamine. In the oxidation of the compound of formula XVI a side reaction to form a double bond between the C6 andC7 positions which may occur as hereinbefore described in the compound of formula V does not occur because the hydroxy group at the 7 position is protected not by a benzoyl group but by a tetrahydropyran 2 yl group. In the sequence of the reaction steps illustratd by the above scheme A, the compound of the formula XI employed as the starting material is known per se, and is described in the specification of the British PatentNo. 201699B Derwent No. 73954B . The bicyclo 3.3.O octane compou ld.s of the general formula VIIA of the present invention may be converted to pharmacologically active 6,9 methano PGI2 analogues of the general formula EMI22.1 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined by the series of reactions depicted schematically below in Scheme B, wherein BMS represents a tert butyldimethyl silyl group and the other symbols are as hereinbefore defined. Scheme BEMI23.1 Scheme B continued EMI24.1 All of the individual reaction steps in SchemeB may be conducted by methods known per se, and suitable reaction conditions are described in the specification of the British Patent No. 2017699B Derwent No. 73954B .For example, step g , the protection of the hydroxy group by the tert butyldimethylsilyl group, may be conducted by using tert butyldimethylsilyl chloride in an inert organic solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of a base such as imidazole at room temperature The step h . deacetylation, may be conducted by using potassium carbonate in methanol at room temperature. The step i may be conducted as described for step f . The step j , the Wittig reaction, may be conducted by reaction with 4 carboxybutylidene triphenylphosphorane of the formula 3P CH CH2 3 COOH in which is as hereinbefore defined in toluene at room temperature. The phosphorane compound may be obtained by the reaction of 4 carboxybutyl triphenylphosphonium bromide with potassium tert butoxide.The step k , esterification, may be conducted by using a solution of diazomethane in diethyl ether, in ethyl acetate at room temperature. The e step 1 , cleavage of the tert butyl dimethylsilyl group, may be conducted by using tetrabutylammonium fluoride n Bu4N F in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. The step m , oxidation, may be conducted as described for the step f . The step n , cleavage of the tetrahydropyran 2 yl group, may be conducted by using a mixture cf tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid and water. a mixture of p toluenesulphonic acid and methanol, or a mixture of dilute hydrochloric acid and tetrahydrofuran at room temperature or under beating. The step o , separation of 5E isomer from 5Z isomer, may be conducted by conventional means, for example, by thin layer, column or high speed liquid chromatography on silica gel, The step p may be conducted by means heretofore mentioned for the conversion of compounds of general formula VIIB to those of general formula VIIA. The step q , saponification, may be conducted by using an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide in ethanol. Compounds of the general formulXXVI and I may, if desired, be purified by recrystallization from a suitable solvent. In the sequence of the reaction steps described above, the separation of 5E isomer from 5Z isomer may also be carried out after introduction of the a chain by the Wittig reaction i.e. purification of the compound of the general formula XX , or as final product i.e.purification of the compound of the general formula I in good yield. The separation of 5E isomer in the form of the compound of the general formula XXIV having an enone groupEMI26.1 gives the highest yield. The proportion of 5E isomer to 5Z isomer is about 5 to i when the separation is conducted in the step o . As described above, the separation of SE isomer from 5Z isomer may also be conducted on the compound of the general formula XX or on the compound of the general formula I . In such case, itis not necessary to use different protecting groups at the 11 and 15positions, the sequence of the reaction steps then being different from that shown in Scheme B. It is then possible to decrease the number of reaction steps from the compound of the general formula VIIA to the final product. Furthermore, the separation of 5E isomer may be carried out in the form of a dicyclohexylamine salt of the final product see Japanese Patent Kokai No.56 122328 as well as by conventional chromatographic separations. When the separation is carried out after introduction of the a chain by the Wittig reaction or on the final product. compounds of the general formulaI may be prepared from a compound of the general formulaVIIA by the series of reactions depicted schematically below in Scheme C, wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined.

Recrystallization can, if desired, give 5E isomer in higher purity.The step x may be also carried out by forming a dicyclohexylamine salt, i.e., it can be conducted by forming a dicyclohexylamine salt of a compound of the general formula XXXI by using dicyclo hexylamie in a suitable solvent, e.g. acetone, and then, if desired, recrystallizing the resulting salt from a suitable solvent, and thereafter converting the salt to the free carboxylic acid under acidic aqueous conditions, e.g. in an aqueous solution of potassium bisulfate, to give a compound of the general formula I rich in 5E isomer thereof. The step z , esterification, may be conducted as hereinbefore described for the step k , or by using methyl iodide in acetone in the presence of an alkali metal, e.g. potassium, carbonate.The step bb , saponification, may be conducted as hereinbefore described for the step q . Compounds of the general formulae XXXIV and I may, if desired, be purified by recrystallization from a suitable solvent. The 5E 6,9 methano PGI2 and derivatives thereof thus obtained have various useful pharmacological properties, see British Patent No. 2017699B, and BritishPatent Publication Nos. 2012265A, 2013661A, 2014143A and 2019847A, and the German Patent Application No. P3315356.6 . It will be appreciated, therefore, that the new compounds of the present invention.of the general formulaVII, i.e. compounds of the general formula VIIA, VIIB andVIIC are useful and important intermediates for the preparation of therapeutically useful 5E 6,9 methanoPGI2 and derivatives thereof. The use of the bicyclo 3.3.0 octane compounds of the general formula VII allows the synthesis of 5E 6,9 methano PGI2 and derivatives thereof by the methods hereinbefore described which avoid certain disadvantages in the use of compounds of the general formula IV and VI and other bicyclo 3.3.0 octane compounds. The use of the compounds of the general formula VII avoids the production of by product, and the need to use a ketal group as a protecting group of a ketone, and enables debenzylation to be carried out using RaneyNickel catalyst.
