## Abstract
A device for the manufacture of natural looking model railway tracks consisting of a number of retainer members 13 with means 15 for retaining two track rails in mutually spaced apart positions, and at least one flexible, elongated interconnecting member 12 adapted to interconnect said retainer members, said interconnecting member s 12 there by being designed with mainly the same flexural resistance in all directions, and adapted to be bendable to optional angular positions relative to the retainer members in order to allow bending of the interconnecting member, and thereby also the rails in more than one plane, and said interconnect ing member s furthermore being adapted to maintain or being able to be brought to maintain its curvature after the flexing force being relieved.
