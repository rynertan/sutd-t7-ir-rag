# Jitter compensated scene stabilized missile guidance system.

## Abstract
An improved missile guidance system is provided which automatically compensates for jitter motion of the optical sight of a video tracker. The invention is adapted to receive video data input from an infrared detector or conventional camera 12 . The invention includes circuits for filtering, gating, and digitalizing the incoming data as well as a formatter for directing successive frames into memory. Two memories 36, 40 are provided the contents of which are sampled by matching logic 42 as the second memory is being loaded. The matching logic 42 thereby compares one frame of data to another at plurality of positions and provides a signal to an address latch 46 when the best match is obtained. The format circuitry 32 provides the position information to the address latch where it is stored for further processing. The output of the address latch is filtered to eliminate any signals representative of intentional tracking motion. The filtered output thus provides the jitter correction to the missile guidance system 60 where missile guidance signals are compensated by the jitter correction.
