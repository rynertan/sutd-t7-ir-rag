# APPARATUS, CIRCUIT AND METHOD FOR COMPENSATING THE DARK CURRENT OF PHOTOELECTRIC TRANSDUCERS

## Abstract
A sample and hold auto zeroing feedback circuit 22 is utilized to drive the dark current of a solid state photodiode 10 to zero in the absence of incident light photons. The just previously attained compensation is then held during a sub sequent quantitative measurement cycle when the photo diode is illuminated. A plurality of linear 24 and or non linear 28 signal processing stages may also be included within the auto zero compensation feedback loop such that their normal offset errors are also simultaneously compen sated.
