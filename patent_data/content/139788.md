# A method for a controlled change of the pore size in solids.

## Abstract
A porous solid, such as a zeolite of clay can be degassed to make them suitable as an adsorbent, after which the entr ances of the pores are narrowed to a desired size by treating the porous solid with two chemisorbable materials, one of which is diborane. The purpose of the first such treatment is to make the entrance so narrow, that unduly large molecules cannot enter and the smaller ones can, whilst a later treatment may serve to narrow the pores still further, so that the adsorbed molecules cannot escape.
