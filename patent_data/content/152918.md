# Olefin conversion.

## Abstract
Olefins are converted into other olefins having different numbers of carbon atoms by contact with a catalyst com prising a silica support containing molybdenum oxide and a promoting amount of at least one titaniferous agent and ac tivated under conditions suitable for the titaniferous agent to promote the activity of molybdenum oxide and silica for the disproportionation and isomerization reaction.
