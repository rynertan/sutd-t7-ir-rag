# Wrist mechanism for industrial robot.

## Abstract
A wrist mechanism for an industrial robot has three degrees of freedom. The first degree of freedom is associ ated with a first input shaft for rotating a wrist portion at a low speed. The second and third degrees of freedom are associated with rotating the tool or tilting the wrist. In order to attain these motions, second and third input shafts are concentrically arranged relative to the first input shaft. Furthermore in a wrist mechanism of the type that two sets of differential speed reduction devices are provided within a wrist and arranged symmetrically of and perpendicularly to the axis of an arm and that the adjustment of the angle of the wrist and the rotation of a tool carried out through the differential speed reduction devices, a novel wrist mechan ism is provided for preventing a wrist cover from entering into a dead point condition. The wrist mechanism comprises a guide protrusion and a guide.
