# Laminar light guide and an instrument display means comprising such a light guide.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to laminar light guides which are particularly suitable for providing illumination from one or more light sources to a pluraliry of instruments and other display devices as in a vehicle instrument panel. The guide makes efficient use of the light available from the light sources. The guide comprises a transparent lamina 2,3,4 having at least one integrally formed light input socket 4 for receiving a light source 14 . The socket 4 is formed with lens means 13 and reflecting means 15 for directing light from the source into the plane of the lamina where it is internally reflected until encountering extracting means including roughened surfaces 6,7,8,9 for reflecting light diffusely out of the plane of the lamina or conical apertures 5 for reflecting light into a beam transverse to the plane of the lamina. The light is extracted to illuminate display characters 16 or areas in an otherwise opaque screen 17 , or to direct light into pointers of instruments, for example clocks, speedometers etc.
