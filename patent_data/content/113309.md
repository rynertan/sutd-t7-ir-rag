# Syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene synthesis process.

## Abstract
This invention reveals a very useful process for produc ing polybutadiene composed essentially of syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene in tetrahydrofuran comprising polymeriz ing 1,3 butadiene in said tetrahydrofuran in the presence of 1 a catalyst composition microencapsulated in a polyene product which contains a at least one cobalt compound selected from the group consisting of i β diketone com plexes of cobalt, ii β keto acid ester complexes of cobalt, iii cobalt salts of organic carboxylic acids having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and iv complexes of halogenated cobalt compounds of the formula CoX
