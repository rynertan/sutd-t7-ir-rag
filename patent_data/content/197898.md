## Description
A formulation based on gelatin and glycine for treating the dryness of the skin SPECIFICATION The present invention relates to a formulation based nn gelatin andsglycine to be administered orally, for the treatment of skin dryness. The so called dry skin is the first and the most obvious harm caused by a modification in the moisture content of the epidermis. It occurs more frequently during the cold season, but it can be shown also in other periods of the year, for example following an extended and excessive exposure to sun rays R. Jackson 27, 106 and B.A. Gilchrest, J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 32, 153 According to researches made by many other authors, the moisture content and state of elasticity of the skin depend essentially on the amount of water present at the level of the horny layer, which is directly linked to a greater or lesser presence of NMF J. Blank,J. Invest. Dermatol. 18 433 440 and K. Laden and R. Spitner, J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 18, 351 . NMF is a mixture of a series of aminoacids, containing about 12 of sodium salt of 5 oxyproline, as well as sugars. The moisturizing activity effected by NMF would be due. essentially to the presence of a glutamic acid derivative, i.e. 5 oxyproline which is more currently known as 2 pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid and indicated by the abbreviation PCA H.W. Speir and P.G. Pascher,Hautarzt 7, 55, J.D. Middleton, Br. J. Dermat. 80, 437 and S. Tatsumi, Amer. Perf. 87, 61 . PCA, transformed into glutamic acid by 5 oxyprolinase comes to take part together with glycine and cysteine, to the metabolic cicles of glutathione A.Meister 1983 Metabolism and transport of glutathione and other g glutamyl compounds in Functions of glutathione A..Larson, S. Orrenius, A. Holmgren andB. Maunervik edits Raven Press N.Y., page 1 . As it is well known, glutathione is a tripeptide formed by elementary aminoacids glycine, cysteine and glutamic acid. It.is also known that in the metabolic cycle glutathione reaches the interior of the cells, rather than the intercellular tissue, wherein the phenomena inherent to the moisturizing of the skin take place. It is consequently surprising that administering glycine associated with gelatin shows a high favourable effect on the skin moisture, in that, as mentioned above, administration of glutamic acid, to which the presence of NMF is linked , could appear promising to this end from the previous literature. In the past glycine, which is a known elementary aminoacid, was used for the treatment of muscular distrophy and it is known that an administration thereof orally has a favourable effect on the smooth musculature. Moreover, it is not known that an administration of gelatin alone could have a favourable influence on cutaneous moisturization. Gelatin which in the official pharmacopea is formally denominated Gelatina F.U. or, according to theInternational denomination Gelatinum , is a known substance which is used, in particular, for the production of medicinal capsules. In the gelatin itself, among other things, a certain amount of glycine is present and it is a surprising fact that, while gelatin powder has no effect on the cutaneous moisture, the association thereof with glycine, in a determined proportion, makes it possible to obtain the desired effect Consequently, the object of the present invention is a formulation for the treatment of skin dryness comprising a mixture of gelatin and glycine in a proportion from 2 1 to 3 1 parts by weight. A proportion of gelatin and glycine of 2,5 1 parts by wight was found particularly effective. Part of the glycine may be substituted by small quantities of oligominerals and vitamins. This addition results in an improvement of the curative effects on dry skin. In preference, a cutaneous moisturization action has been found on administration of the formulation orally, in the form of soft capsules, formed by a method known as the Scherer method, described for example in the USA patents 2318718, 2356436, 2333433, 2379816, 2378817, 2451141 or also by other methods. Capsules of so called soft gelatin are used as containers for different active pharmaceutical principles. Such capsules of soft gelatin are usually hollow, in that they are intended to contain a medicinal product in the cavity. It is, however, also possible to use solid spherules. By the term soft solid gelatin spherules a spherule free of cavity is intended, wherein the glycine is fused together to the gelatin components, such as to be intimately dispersed therein, rather than contained in a shell of gelatin as a separate phase. The methods for the preparation of solid spherules are known from the prior art. As an example, the spherule can weigh 2,8 g., of which 2 g is the amount of gelatin and 800 mg is the amount of glycine. Experimental tests are referred to hereinbelow. EXAMPLE 1. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Solid spherules of gelatin glycine have been used, which had been prepared according to a particular process, each formed by 500 mg gelatin and 200 mg glycine. APPARATUS Corneometer CM 420 Test of water absorbtion ejection In order to evaluate the moisture condition of the subjects under test measures have been effected in a previously determined area of the right forearm following the method of Tagami and coll. H. Tagami et al, J.Invest. Dermatol. 78,425 . Said method consists of applying 0,1 ml distilled water on a skin surface of 2,5 cm2. After application after 10 seconds the excess water is eliminated by absorbent paper and the first measurement is immediately effected. The measurement is repeated at 30, 60, 90 and 120 seconds. The measurements have been carried out by corneometer CM 420, based on the principle of dielectric constants K. Mosler, Parf. und Kosmetik 64, 375 . The results obtained are referred to in figures 1 and 2. Evaluation of the cutaneous moisture on human skin To 30 volunteers of female sex, aging between 30 and 40, all suffering from dry skin, spherules of gelatinglycine spherules A and control spherules spherulesB wherein glycine was substituted by starch, were delivered following the double blind system. Neither the operatorsnor the subjects were able to identif the pro duct considered as active. The spherules were taken orally in a quantity of four a day and for two months, in a period comprised betweenSeptember and December. Ten days before and during the treatment the subjects did not use any cosmetic, with the exception of a detergent milk. Another lot of fifteen control subjects of the same average age made use only of the same detergent milk which was used in the morning as a cleaning milk. Before beginning the treatment at ten o clock a.m.the condition of moisture and the ability of the skin to bind water test of absorbtion ejection by the subjects, one hour after the detersion, was evaluated in vivo . The room where all the measures have been carried out was constantly maintained at a constant temperature and moisture 18 C RH 50 . Once the test began, readings were taken on 15th, 30th, 45th and 60th day. On such days, after effecting the direct control reading, the ability of the skin to bind water was also evaluated following the method of water absorbtion ejection of Tagami. The values as obtained are referred to in table 1 and in a graphic form, in figure 3. Resuming, in figure 1 are shown the values of water absorbtionejection after an oral administration for 15 days of gelatin glycine average of 15 subjects per lot in figure 2 are shown the values of the water absorbtion ejection after an oral administration for 30 days of gelatin glycine average of 15 subjects per lot in figure 3 is shown the evaluation of the cutaneous moisture after an oral administration of gelatin glycine average of 15 subjects per lot and in table 1 are shown the values of the evaluation of the cutaneous moisture after an oral administration of gelatin glycine average of 5 subjects per lot .

Such an increase, which can already be remarked after about a 15 day treatment by oral route, reaches the highest values after 30 days, increasing by 40 . In fact, the values determined on the 60th day do not significantly differ from those evaluated after a 30 day treatment see figure 3 and table 1 . It will be appreciated that the ability of the skin to retain water can be directly related to the amount of glycine present in the spherules. Mainly a good improvement was found even in the individuals who had to take product B control based on gelatin and starch. As mentioned herein before, gelatin is a protein of animal source, in the aminoacid composition of which about 30 glycine can be found. The activity peformed by gelatin glycine with respect to the cutaneous moisture can be more clearly seen from figure 3 and table 1. In fact, a high improvement in the horny layer moisture can be noted, as detected by means of a corneometerCM 4,20. The moisture degree increases by about 20 already after the first 30 days of treatment, which successively is maintained to such values during the following days of dietetic therapy. From figure 3 and table 1 there can be seen also the tendency of gelatin to improve the degree of cutaneous moisture in the treated individuals. Probably glycine through the glutathione cycle increases significantly the production of cellular PCA which can be detected at the level of the horny layer. EXAMPLE 2. The experimentation was carried out following the same method and using the same apparatus as described in example 1. MATERIALS AND METHODS Soft gelatin Scherer capsules were used, having the follewin compositions CAPSULE A Beeswax 30 mg Soy lecithin 34 mg Vegetal oil 310 mg Starch 200 mg Gelatin 250 mg Shell Gelatin 166 mg CAPSULE B Starch was replaced by a similar amount of glutamic acid. CAPSULE C Starch was replaced by a similar amount of gelatin. CAPSULE D Gel atin was replaced by starch and the amount of starch indicated in capsule A was replaced by a similar amount of glycine. CAPSULE E Starch was replaced by glycine. CAPSULE F Starch was replaced by 150 mg glycine additioned with oligoelements ferrous lactate, manganese oxide, copper lactate, tri calcium phosphate in such an amount as to have 3 mg Fe , 0,5 mg Ion ,0,6 mg Cu , 40 mg Ca and with vitamines 10 mg Vit. C and 0,4 mg Vit. B6 . Evaluation of the cutaneous moisturization on human skin Sixty volunteers of female sex divided into 6 lots of 10, ageing between 35 and 43, affected by dry skin, were provided with the test products. Each person received randomly from the experimentor the 240 capsules required for the two months of treatment. The capsules, divided into 6 lots, were distinguished with letters A toF , as previously indicated, which are hereinafter briefly resumed A Gelatin Starch control B Gelatin Glutammic acid C Gelatin alone D Glycine Starch E Gelatin Glycine F Gelatin Oligoelements Vitamines Glycine Neither the operator nor the subjects were able to identify the product. The capsules were administered orally in a dose of four per day and for two months. The 10 subjects administered with the capsules indicated as A have been considered as controls. RESULTS AND COMMENTS As it can be seen from tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 no positive results have been obtained with the capsules indicated by letters A, B, C and D. Gelatin alone or additioned with glutammic acid, as well as glycine alone,without gelatin, are not capable of improving the moisturization degree of human skin, by the method used. When gelatin is added to glycine capsule E a 12 increase in cutaneous moisturization is obtained after fifteen days only and a 30 increase is obtained after about 30 or 45 days of oral treatment table 6 . If the glycine amount is reduced from 200 to 50 mg, however, with an addition of oligoelements and specific vitamines iron, copper, manganese, vitamine C and vitamine B6 a further increase in cutaneous moisturization is verified, namely 30 after 15 days and 40 after about 30 or 45 days of treatment table 7 .TABLE 2 Capsule A Gelatin Starch CONTROLPATIENT 15 30 45 1 78 74 76 2 72 76 78 3 75 75 78 4 77 73 75 5 74 77 73 6 72 74 76 7 76 78 73 8 78 74 72 9 73 75 77 10 75 72 76 average 75.1 75.4 75.1 variation 4.09 4.44 standard deviation 2.02 2.11 2.39 TABLE 3 Capsule B Gelatin Glutammic acid PATIENT 15 30 45 11 78 78 77 12 75 76 75 13 73 79 76 14 75 77 74 15 76 74 73 16 74 77 75 17 78 75 76 18 76 78 74 19 73 77 74 20 73 78 74 average 75.1 76.9 74.8 variation 3.29 2.09 1.36 standard deviation 1.81 1.45 1.17 TABLE 4 Capsule C Gelatin PATIENT 15 30 45 21 76 78 75 22 73 73 76 23 74 76 73 24 75 74 76 25 78 76 75 26 72 74 73 27 72 73 74 28 73 76 75 29 75 75 76 30 77 76 75 average 74.5 75.1 74.8 variation 3.85 2.29 1.16 standard deviation 1.96 1.51 1.08 TABLE 5 Capsule D Glycine Starch PATIENT 15 30 45 31 74 76 79 32 , 77 76 75 33 73 72 75 34 78 79 78 35 75 77 76 36 72 73 74 37 76 74 70 38 75 75 73 39 78 78 75 40 73 74 76 average 75.1 75.4 75.1 variation 4.09 4.44 5.69 standard deviation 2.02 2.11 2.39 TABLE 6 Capsule E Gelatin Glycine PATIENT 15 30 45 51 85 99 96 52 84 97 98 53 86 89 91 54 83 92 93 55 87 97 96 56 84 98 99 57 86 95 95 58 82 93 98 59 84 90 95 60 87 97 99 average 84.8 94.7 96.0 variation 2.56 11.01 6.20 standard deviation 1.60 3.32 2.49 TABLE 7 Capsule F Gelatin Oligoelements Vitamines Glycine PATIENT 15 30 45 41 91 105 105 42 89 107 106 43 90 100 104 44 92 104 105 45 94 110 109 46 92 100 106 47 94 103 104 48 96 110 108 49 90 100 110 50 93 107 110 average 92.1 104.6 106.7 variation 4.29 13.64 5.01 standard deviation 2.07 3.69 2.24 A statistical analysis of the results obtained, provides the following comparison table of the theoretical mean values of the cutaneous moisturization degree obtained after administering the different types of capsules.TABLE 8 THEORETICAL MEAN VALUES 15 days 30 days 45 daysCAPSULE A 74.87 75.07 75.27CAPSULE B 75.75 75.60 75.45CAPSULE C 74.65 74.80 74.95CAPSULE D 75.20 75.20 75.20CAPSULE E 86.10 92.10 98.10CAPSULE F 93.83 101.13 108.43 According to the data obtained in the second experiment, it results that the gelatin used in the capsules or spherules as carrier of glycine, is able to make glycine immediately available as an aminoacid necessary for the collagen and probably also elastin formation. In fact the increase in cutaneous moisturization observed after oral administration of gelatin glycine, is further increased by 10 15 when glycine is enriched with oligoelements Fe , Cu , Zn and Ca which are considered as cofactors necessary and required both for the metabolic balance and the building of internal and external bonds of the collagen and elastin molecules withVitamin C as cofactor in the hydroxylation process of proline and lysine radicals, and with Vitamine B6 as an enzyme as pyridoxal phosphate in the oxidative deamination reaction of the free amine group of lysine and oxylysine. In conclusion from the experimental data and observations, it appears that the combination of gelatinglycine can act by means of two different biological mechanisms. It promotes the collagen synthesis by raising the deep cutaneous moisturization and activates one or more enzyme systems which are required for a continuous cutaneous production of sodium PCA, which is most responsable for surface moisturizing activity.
