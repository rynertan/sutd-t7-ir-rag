# Apparatus for finishing slide fastener stringers.

## Abstract
A chain of interdigitating coupling elements on a pair of slide fastener stringer tapes is gapped and severed into a short length of chain with coupling element residuals or debris left on the tapes at the gapped chain portion. The chain is then manually fed between and into engagement with a pair of vertically aligned circular brushes driven for continuous rotation to scrape the coupling element residuals off the tapes. A pair of guide troughs guide the chain into alignment with the brushes, each guide trough having a pair of converging sidewalls confining one of the brushes solely to frictional engagement with the chain.
