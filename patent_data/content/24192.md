# Silver silver halide electrodes and process for preparing same.

## Abstract
A silver silver halide electrode is prepared by coating portions of a layer of silver 2 with a metal 3 selected from the group consisting of chromium, nickel, and alloys of nickel and chromium and overall treating with an oxidizing agent in the presence of halide ion to form a silver halide layer 4 on those portions of the silver layer not covered by metal. The electrodes can be used as assaying electrodes such as for halide ions or as reference electrodes. Reference elements formed from the reference electrodes are useful in providing ion selective membrane electrodes.
