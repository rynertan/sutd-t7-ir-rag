# CONNECTING DEVICE

## Abstract
A connecting device comprises a body of shape memory metal 10 capable of reversing between a martensitic and an ausenitic state, the body comprising at least two arms 14,16 cantilevered to form a support means 18 which joins the arms. The arms 14,16 are deformable with low force when the body is in its martensitic state and the arms revert towards their undeformed state when the body is in its austenitic state. Preferably the arms 14,16 are deformable away from each other and converge to grip a substrate when the body is in its austenitic state.
