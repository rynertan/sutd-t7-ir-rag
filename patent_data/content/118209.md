# PROCESS FOR PREPARING A CATALYST

## Abstract
A catalyst for use in the liquefaction of coal or in the hydrogenolysis or hydrodesulfurization of heavy oils is prepared by reacting one or more members selected from carbonyl compounds of molybdenum, salts of molybdenum, oxides of molybdenum, metallic molybdenum, and alloys containing molybdenum, with alkali and water, at a tempera ture of from 220 to 450 C under a carbon monoxide atmosphere, and reducing the resulting reaction product in the presence of a phenol at a temperature of from 400 to 450 C under a hydrogen atmosphere.
