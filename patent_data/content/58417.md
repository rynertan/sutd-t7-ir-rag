# Method for transmitting time division multiplexed data.

## Abstract
A method for transmitting time sharing multidata in which data series of a plurality of channels are time sharing multiplexed to form a transmitting data series having the steps of adding an error detecting or error correcting redundant bit and a synchronizing redundant bit to an information bit of a predetermined number contained in the respective data series of said channels to form one transmit ting unit, forming bit groups in a manner as to take each bit as one group which is corresponding to each other between the channels with respect to the information bit, the error detecting or error correcting redundant bit and the synchro nizing redundant bit of said one transmitting unit of each of said channels, time sharing multiplexing the data series so as to form one frame in which these bit groups are sequentially continued to each other and using a bit pattern of the bit groups in the synchronizing redundant bit as a frame synchronizing signal of the transmitting data series.
