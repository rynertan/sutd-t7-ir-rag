## Description
This invention relates to a modified gamma interferon, to DNA sequences that code for it, and to processes for making it. More particularly, the invention relates to an amino 3 gamma interferon which is more soluble, and accordingly easily purifiable, and which is highly stable and retains at least a similar level of antiviral and antiproliferative biological activity as full length mature human gamma interferon. This invention also relates to the DNA sequence coding for the amino Δ3 gamma interferon, and to processes for expressing that DNA sequence to produce the amino Δ3 gamma interferon. Finally, the invention relates to methods and DNA sequences for improving the expression levels of DNA sequences encoding selected proteins and polypeptides, including but not limited to gamma interferon or amino Δ3 gamma interferon. In this application we will use the interferon nomenclature announced in IFN is a cellular protein displaying antiviral activity against a broad range of viruses through induction of cellular RNA and protein synthesis directed against virus replication. For example, human IFN has been used to combat the viral activity of the following respiratory infections IFN has other effects in addition to its antiviral action. For example, it antagonizes the effect of colony stimulating factor, inhibits the growth of hemopoietic colony forming cells and interferes with the normal differentiation of granulocyte and macrophage precursors IFN may also play a role in the regulation of the immune response. For example, depending upon the dose and time of application in relation to antigen, IFN can be both immunopotentiating and immunosuppressive Killer lymphocytes and antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity may be directly or indirectly involved in the immunological attack on tumor cells. Therefore, in addition to its use as an antiviral agent, IFN has potential application in antitumor and anticancer therapy and in immunomodulation agents and methods Interferons, like other antitumor agents, seem most effective when directed against small tumors. The antitumor effects of animal IFN are dependent on dosage and time, but have been demonstrated at concentrations below toxic levels. Accordingly, numerous investigations and clinical trials have been and continue to be conducted into the antitumor and anticancer properties of human IFNs. These include treatment of several malignant diseases such as osteosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin s disease Interferon therapy against viruses and tumors or cancers has been conducted at varying dosage regimes and under several modes of administration The extent of the therapy and the dosage regime depends on the patient and the condition being treated. For example, virus infections are usually treated by daily or twice daily doses over several days to two weeks and tumors and cancers are usually treated by daily or multiple daily doses over several months or years. The most effective therapy for a given patient must, of course, be determined by the attending physician, who will consider such well known factors as the course of the disease, previous therapy, and the patient s response to interferon in selecting a mode of administration and a dosage regime. Interferons have been classified into two groups Type I and Type II IFNs. Type I IFNs are the classical acid stable IFNs induced by viruses or synthetic polynucleotides and generally consist of two species IFN αs and IFN β. Type II IFN consists of only one species designated as IFN γ. IFN γ is also referred to in the art as immune or gamma interferon. IFN γ is a glycoprotein induced in lymphocytes by specific antigen or various mitogens and is antigenically distinct from IFN α and IFN β A. Mizrahi et al., Glycosylation Of Interferon , In addition to being acid labile at pH2 , IFN γ has been reported to be inactivated after 1 hour at 56 C. See also M. deLey et al., Interferon Induced In Human Leukocytes By Mitogens Production, Partial Purification And Characterization , In addition to its antiviral activity, IFN γ displays antitumor or anticancer activity. Various studies indicate that IFN γ works both directly and indirectly to inhibit the growth of, or to kill, certain tumor cells. Moreover, as compared to IFN α and IFN β, IFN γ s antitumor activity, at least in mice, results in tumor regression. In addition, its activation of natural killer cells does not reach a plateau, as observed for IFN α and IFN β. IFN γ is also less inhibited by circulating levels of gangliosides than are IFN α and IFN β H. Ankel et al., Mouse Fibroblast Type I And Immune Type II Interferons Pronounced Differences In Affinity For Gangliosides And In Antiviral And Antigrowth Effects On Mouse Leukemia L 1210R Cells , Another use of IFN γ may be as an immunoregulatory agent. The antiproliferative effect of IFN γ on transformed cells has been reported to be 10 to 100 times greater than that of IFN α or IFN β P. W. Gray et al., The DNA sequence coding for human IFN γ has been cloned and utilized to transform various hosts which then produce IFN γ e.g., W. Fiers et al., The Human Fibroblast And Human Immune Interferon Genes And Their Expression In Homologous And Heterologous Cells , Instead, as the transformed cell accumulates large amounts of the foreign IFN γ protein, the IFN γ molecules interact with each other to form highly insoluble aggregates not typically found in the normal cell. The cell then may react to this accumulation of protein by forming inclusion bodies into which the foreign protein aggregates are packaged. As a result of this insolubility and cellular packaging, the IFN γ containing aggregates may be isolated from the cell. However, after extraction and resuspension in buffer, it has been very difficult to purify the IFN γ from the bacterial and other cellular extracts of the variety of hosts in which it has been produced. These purification problems have, therefore, hindered efforts to make IFN γ available in the amounts needed for use in antiviral, anticancer and immunomodulation methods and compositions. The present invention solves the problems referred to above by providing a more soluble, and accordingly easily purifiable, amino 3 IFN γ in which three amino acid residues have been deleted from the amino terminal end of the IFN γ as compared to full length IFN γ. This deletion does not substantially change the biological activity of the protein. Yet, it provides an IFN γ like protein that is highly stable, more soluble, and therefore more easily purifiable, than previously made recombinant IFN γ. The amino 3 IFN γ of this invention may be used in antiviral, antiproliferative or immunomodulative compositions, such as those comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of the protein, or in antiviral, antiproliferative or immunomodulative methods characterized by the step of treating a cell in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner with a pharmaceutically effective amount of such compositions. This invention also includes the DNA sequences coding for the amino 3 IFN γ and the methods for using those sequences to produce the amino 3 IFN γ. More preferably, the DNA sequences of this invention are additionally modified by a deletion of nucleotides in the 3 non coding region of the IFN γ gene but maintaining at least the poly G tail at the carboxy terminal end of the non coding region. This deletion further enhances the expression of the gene within the various transformed hosts and results in increased yields of amino 3 IFN γ. It may also be used alone to enhance the expression levels of other IFN γ like polypeptides. Recent publications, including EP A 146 354 Genentech , WO 83 04053 Applied Molecular Genetics , Derynk et al. Furthermore, such a 3 non coding deletion in the non coding region of any DNA sequence coding for a selected protein or polypeptide and carrying a 3 poly G tail enhances the expression levels of that DNA sequence in the transformed host cell and improves the levels of selected protein production in that cell.

Figure 5 is a depiction of the DNA sequence of the IFN γ containing insert of a recombinant DNA molecule useful as a starting material in the methods of this invention. In order that the invention herein described may be more fully understood, the following detailed description is set forth. In the description, the following terms are employed This invention provides a stable, biologically active amino 3 IFN γ, which lacks at its amino terminal end the three amino acid sequence of cysteine tyrosine cysteine of mature IFN γ. This modified IFN γ, referred to as amino 3 IFN γ, also displays increased solubility as compared to full length recombinant IFN γ. It is, therefore, more easily purifiable from cellular extracts than full length recombinant IFN γ. While not wishing to be bound by theory, applicants believe that the improved solubility of their amino 3 IFN γ is due to the elimination of the cysteine residues at the amino terminal end. Cysteines have sulfhydryl side chains which tend to form intermolecular disulfide linkages between individual IFN γ molecules. Accordingly, these linkages result in highly insoluble protein aggregates within the cell. Such insoluble aggregates complicate purification procedures. Thus, the elimination of the cysteine residues from the amino terminal end of IFN γ prevents these sulfhydryl interactions and provides a more soluble and easily purifiable amino 3 IFN γ. Production of the amino 3 IFN γ of this invention begins with the preparation of a DNA sequence coding for that modified interferon. This DNA sequence has a deletion of nine nucleotides at the amino terminal end of the DNA sequence encoding mature IFN γ. Accordingly, on expression, a protein is produced having the first three amino acids, cysteine tyrosine cysteine, deleted from mature IFN γ. More preferably, an additional number of nucleotides of the 3 non coding non translated region of the IFN γ gene are also deleted in the DNA sequences of this invention. This latter, and more preferred, construction results in a higher degree of expression of the amino 3 IFN γ coding sequence in host cells transformed with these sequences. In addition, such a deletion in the 3 non coding region of any DNA sequence coding for a selected protein or polypeptide and carrying a 3 poly G tail results in a higher degree of expression of that protein or polypeptide in transformed host cells. Accordingly, the use of such deletions are part of this invention. Any of a large number of expression vectors, expression control sequences and hosts may be used in combination with the DNA sequences of this invention to produce the desired amino 3 IFN γ. For example, useful expression vectors may consist of segments of chromosomal, non chromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences, such as various known derivatives of SV40 and known bacterial plasmids, e.g., plasmids from Various expression control sequences may be employed. These include, for example, the operator, promoter and ribosome binding and interaction sequences including sequences such as the Shine Dalgarno sequences of the lactose operon of Of course, not all vector expression control sequence host combinations may be equally efficient. The particular selection of a specific combination may be made by those of skill in the art after due consideration of the principles set forth without departing from the scope of this invention. It should also be understood that because neither the coding sequence for mature IFN γ nor the coding sequence for amino 3 IFN γ begin with an ATG start codon, this translational start signal must be inserted in front of the coding sequence before expression. Such constructions of an ATG coding sequence combination may be done by those of skill in the art without departing from the scope of this invention. These constructions enable the production in appropriate transformed hosts of f met IFN γ or f met amino 3 IFN γ. However, heterogeneity due to the presence or absence of the amino terminal Met cannot be excluded because some hosts, e.g., In order that this invention and the methods of using it may be more fully understood, the following example is provided. This example is for illustrative purposes only. Other means and methods may be employed to construct, to produce and to use the amino 3 IFN γ of this invention without departing from the scope hereof. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, we have shown therein a schematic outline of one embodiment of a process for preparing the more preferred DNA sequence of this invention. This sequence encodes amino 3 IFN γ and also carries a 422 nucleotide deletion in the 3 non coding region of IFN γ. According to this embodiment, we first deleted 422 nucleotides from the 3 non coding region of the IFN γ gene by nuclease digestion. We then deleted the nine nucleotides after the ATG start codon in the 5 coding region amino terminal end of the IFN γ gene by site specific mutagenesis. The starting material used in the embodiment of this invention described here is recombinant DNA molecule per ori γ Figure 1 a which contains the DNA sequence encoding mature IFN γ, operatively linked to a As depicted in Step a of Figure 1, we first restricted per ori γ with As depicted in Step c of Figure 1, we treated one aliquot of the above We digested the other aliquot of the The two DNA fragments produced above were then ligated to form a recircularized DNA characterized by a 422 nucleotide deletion in the 3 non coding region of the IFN γ gene Step e , Figure 1 . This deletion results in a higher level of expression of the IFN γ gene in cells transformed with the molecule, i.e., approximately 20 30 of the total cellular protein. This deletion is useful in the expression of any IFN γ coding sequence. Accordingly, it need not be combined as below with the coding sequence for amino 3 IFN γ. Instead, it may be advantageously employed in the production of other IFN γs and IFN y like polypeptides. By use of After incorporation of the above described deletion into the IFN γ gene, we then introduced a 9 nucleotide deletion in the 5 coding region of the IFN γ gene to produce a coding sequence for amino 3 IFN γ. It should be understood that while we first manipulated our starting recombinant DNA molecule, per ori γ, to introduce the 422 nucleotide non coding deletion, we could as well have introduced the 9 nucleotide deletion in the amino terminal end first or even not combined that deletion with the 422 nucleotide non coding deletion. However, preferably, our expression vehicle carries both deletions because high levels of expression are obtained. As shown in Figure 2, we treated the recircularized molecule in two ways. We restricted one aliquot of the DNA with We restricted the second aliquot of our recircularized molecule with We next mixed the single stranded DNA fragments produced by the two above described restrictions at 60 C in Tris HCl pH 8 EDTA NaCl TEN hybridization buffer for 2 3 h Step c , Figure 2 . This reannealed the DNA fragments to form a renatured double stranded plasmid with a gap in one strand between the We next prepared a synthetic oligonucleotide primer, having the sequence CGATACTATGCAGGACCC. As depicted in Figure 4, this primer is complementary to the DNA sequence of molecule per ori γ in the region of the We hybridized the above described primer to the single standed DNA portion of our renatured DNA, described above Step d , Figure 2 . We affected this hybridization in ligase polymerase buffer at 17 C to ensure that the 9 nucleotide deletion would not prevent hybridization. We then filled in the single stranded DNA gap using the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment and ligase Step e , Figure 2 . This procedure results in the production of a double stranded DNA having on one strand the complete coding sequence of IFN γ and having on the other strand a DNA sequence lacking the nine nucleotides which code for the first three amino terminal amino acids of IFN γ Figure 4 . We then transformed We took the selected hosts strong signal, no mismatch with probe that contained a DNA sequence carrying on one strand the desired 9 nucleotide deletion, grew them up in rich medium, lyzed them, and observed two protein bands, one corresponding to the full length IFN γ and the other corresponding to the amino 3 IFN γ. The reason we observed two bands is that the cultured cells, having undergone replication, now contain two types of molecules. Step f , Figure 2 . One is formed by replication of the DNA strand that contains the full length IFN γ coding sequence and the other is formed by replication of the DNA strand that has the 9 nucleotide deletion following the start codon of the IFN γ gene. Accordingly, we made minipreps from the positive host cells and separated the two types of plasmids using Grunstein Hogness hybridization selection with the synthetic probe at 42 C as before, selecting the strongly positive plasmids Step g , Figure 2 . We then transformed The amino 3 IFN γ prepared above was then compared with full length IFN γ, prepared from It should, of course, be understood that while we have described one method for producing amino 3 IFN γ, a variety of other methods may also be employed to prepare this modified IFN γ. For example, at the DNA level, other methods may be used to produce the coding sequence of amino 3 IFN γ. These include synthetic methods and other mutagenesis and deletion methods. At the protein level, a variety of techniques also exist to produce amino 3 IFN γ. It should also be understood that while the above example is directed to an amino 3 IFN γ encoded by a DNA sequence also having an additional 422 or 484 nucleotide deletion in the non coding region of the IFN γ gene, this invention is not so limited. Rather, it includes DNA sequences containing a nucleotide deletion in the 3 non coding region which may be of varying length, the deletion preferably starting at the Furthermore, the present invention also extends to DNA sequences coding for any protein or polypeptide and carrying a 3 poly G tail, the DNA sequences containing a nucleotide deletion in the 3 non coding region of the gene but maintaining at least the poly G tail at the carboxy terminal end of the non coding region. This deletion enhances the level of expression of the DNA sequences in host cells transformed with those DNA sequences and results in increased yields of the protein or polypeptide. Microorganisms, recombinant DNA molecules, and DNA sequences prepared by the processes of this invention are exemplified by cultures deposited in the culture collection Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen in Gottingen, West Germany on March 12, 1984 These cultures were assigned accession numbers DSM 2920, 2921 and 2922, respectively. While we have herein presented a number of embodiments of this invention, it is apparent that our basic construction can be altered to provide other embodiments which utilize the process and composition of this invention. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the scope of this invention is to be defined by the claims appended hereto rather than by the specific embodiments which have been presented hereinbefore by way of example.
