# Vacuum drainage system for wounds.

## Abstract
A drain tube 22 from a wound terminates in a sleeve 283 which fits over a spigot 282 of a collecting bottle 220. The bottle fits on a base unit 12 which maintains a partial vacuum in the bottle by evacuation through a one way valve 254. A similar valve 286 prevents return flow from the bottle. A float 259 closes the evacuation opening 257 when the bottle is full. The bottle can be removed from the base unit and carried around by the patient with the vacuum maintained by closure of the valve 254. A bottle emptying port is formed by boss 293 covered by a screw cap 297 with central opening 299 blocked by plug 294 carried by cross bar 295.
