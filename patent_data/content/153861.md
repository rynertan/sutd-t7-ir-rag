# Video signal delay circuit.

## Abstract
A video signal delay circuit comprises an input horizon tal transfer register 13 supplied serially with an input composite video signal, an input vertical transfer gate 14 , a plurality of columns 15 of vertical transfer registers, an output vertical transfer gate 16 , an output horizontal transfer register 17 , a horizontal transfer clock pulse generating circuit 19 , a vertical transfer clock pulse generat ing circuit 33 and a vertical transfer gate pulse generating circuit 32 . The vertical transfer clock pulse generating circuit generates a vertical transfer clock pulse at a rate of once per one horizontal scanning period of the input composite video signal and additionally generates one or more vertical transfer clock pulses during a specific time period. Or, the horizontal transfer clock pulse generating circuit generates a horizontal transfer clock pulse having a selected phase or a selected number of horizontal transfer clock pulses.
