# A compact low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
A compact low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp comprises two or more straight tubes which are intercon nected by arcuate connecting means 12 to form a discharge chamber between two electrodes 9 . These electrodes are located in the distal ends 2, 3 of the lamp, and the ends 2, 3 are connected in a gas tight manner to a lamp base 8 incor porating necessary contact pins 6, 7 and electrical conduc tors 8 . The interconnecting means 12 presents a spine 13 which extends along the means 12 . When seen in cross section, the spine 13 exhibits an acute angle which defines a condensation space for condensation of mercury vapour used in the lamp. As a result of the shape of the spine 13 the mercury vapour condenses outside the circular cross section area 14 where the positive column is formed during opera tion of the lamp, the discharge current passing in this column.
