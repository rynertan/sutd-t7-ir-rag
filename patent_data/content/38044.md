# Grain boundary layer dielectric ceramic compositions.

## Abstract
Grain boundary layer dielectric ceramic compositions comprising semiconductive ceramic grains having a com position of 50.23 to 49.47 mol of SrO and CaO, 49.72 to 50.23 mol of TiO₂, 0.05 to 0.3 mol of Nb₂O₅, sub stantially each of said grains being surrounded by grain boundary layer dielectric materials which is formed by grain boundary diffusion of a mixture having a compo sition of 93.5 to 8.5 mol of Bi₂O₃, 4.5 to 45 mol of Cu₂O, 0.5 to 4 mol of MnO₂, 1 to 8.5 mol of B₂O₃, 0.5 to 17 mol of La₂O₃, and below 17 mol of TiO₂. These ceramic compositions provide capacitors hav ing the temperature coefficient of capacitance less than 15 , the apparent dielectric constant higher than 35,000, the dielectric loss less than 0.01 and the break down voltage higher than 500 V mm or capacitors having the temperature coefficient of capacitance less than 10 , the apparent dielectric constant higher than 20,000, the dielectric loss less than 0.01 and the break down voltage higher than 700 V mm or capacitors having the temperature coefficient of capacitance less than 5 , the apparent dielectric constant higher than 5,000, the dielectric loss less than 0.01 and the breakdown voltage higher than 700 V mm.
