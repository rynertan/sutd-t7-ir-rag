# A composite driving belt provided with transverse elements with coupling means, and a transverse element for a driving belt.

## Abstract
A driving belt for application on V shaped pulleys comprising an endless carrier and a plurality of transverse elements abutting against each other with the head sides and slideably assembled on the carrier. The transverse elements are provided with coupling means comprising at least one projection 6 at one head side 2 and substantially corresponding recess es 7 at the other head side 3 of a transverse element. Around the coupling means there is some clearance 8 , i.e. the thickness of the transverse elements distance between the two head sides of a transverse element around the coupling means is smaller than the nominal thickness n of the transverse element distance between corresponding head sides of successive transverse elements . In this way an improved engagement of the coupling means can be achieved.
