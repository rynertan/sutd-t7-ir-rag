# Quaternized cellular polymers from amine terminated poly oxyalkylene and polyfunctional epoxides.

## Abstract
An absorbent cellular polymeric material is provided which exhibits enhanced water retentivity and may also exhibit enhanced compressibility. Such a material is pro vided by foaming the reaction product of a poly aminoether and an epoxy resin and quaternizing the resulting reaction product with, for example, an acid. The foam is particularly usable in products for absorbing body fluids.
