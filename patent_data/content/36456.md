## Description
ELASTOMERS DERIVED FROM THIODIETHANOL HAVING REDUCED ODOR AND INCREASED THERMAL STABILITY It is very well known that thiodiethanol, by virtue of having hydroxyl groups attached to carbon atoms situated beta to a sulfur atom in an aliphatic chain, exhibits unusual reaction activity. Unlike alkanediols, e.g., 1,4 butanediol, thiodiethanol quite readily undergoes an auto condensation reaction under the influence of heat and certain acidic dehydration catalysts, such as hydrogen chloride. Low molecular weight, rubber like materials, as indicated in the following reaction schcme, are obtaine3 EMI1.1 The acid catalyzed auto condensation of thiodiethanol with hydrochloric acid and phosphorus pentoxide, and the co condensation with other aliphatic hydroxyl compounds has been studied.Hydrochloric acid catalyst provided low molecularweight, waxy, water soluble polymers and ring closed byproducts, e.g., thioxane and dithiane, while phosphorus pentoxide catalyst afforded products ranging from viscous liquids to rubbery waxes Some indication of co condensation with diethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, and butylene glycols was found. However, no useful rubbery products were produced. Thiodiethanol has also been copolynwerized with equimolar amounts of 1,6 hexanediol, in the presence of p toluenesulfonic acid catalyst to give low molecular weight, waxy polymers with triethylene glycol, 1,6 hexanediol and trimethylolpropane in the presence of phosphorous acid catalyst to give low molecular weight polymers useful as polyurethane intermediates and with thiodipropionic acid catalyst to give hydroxyl terminated, low molecular weight polymers suitable for polyurethanes. These products have been reacted with aromatic diisocyanates to provide polyurethane elastomers. Sulfur vulcanizable elastomers, based on the condensation of thiodiethanol with one or more aliphatic diols containing a sulfur vulcanizable double bond, are described by Aloia, U.S. Patent 3,951,927 Chang et al., U.S. Patent 3,985,708 Chang, U.S. Patent 4,000,213 and Li et al.,U.S. Patent 4,028,305. All of the known polymers of polythiodiethanol derived by an acid catalyzed condensation are, to a greater or lesser degree, malodorous. This odor, which can be quite repugnant, is believed to be attributable to the ring closed by products, thioxane and dithiane, produced during the condensation. The degree of ring closed by product formation can ba reduced to some extent by a prudent choice of acid catalyst, phosphorous acid being one of the best in this respect. However, in any case, useful rubbery products, exhibiting outstanding physical properties, are obtained from thiodiethanol, but these products have not achieved more than limited success in the marketplace because of their characteristic malodor. Additionally, the sulfur vulcanizable polymers described above exhibit outstanding properties. However, the vulcanized elastomers produced therefrom are not as thermally stable as desired, i.e., they suffer loss of properties tensile strength, elongation on aging at elevated temperatures. One of the most serious disadvantages of the thermal instability is manifested by high compression set properties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the discovery that the odor characteristic of condensation polymers of thiodiethanol can be substantially reduced to acceptable levels, if not totally eliminated, by the incorporation therein of a salt of certain metals at one or more stages of the elastomer preparation and that the thermal stability of sulfur vulcanized elastomers can be increased by adding copper salts thereto. r.SCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION INCLUDING PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A. The Metal Salts Metal salts which have been found to substantially reduce the malodor of polymers of thiodiethanol according to the invention hereof are those capable of complexing with the odor producing components of the thiodiethanol polymers which are produced during the polymer production. Any metal salt which performs this function can be used in accordance with the instant invention. Those salts found particularly useful include the salts of metals appearing in Groups IB, IIB and VIII of Mendeleeff s Periodic Table of the Elements, notably copper, silver, nickel, zinc, cadmium, mercury, iron and cobalt. The preferred metal salts are copper and zinc salts useful anions are halides especially chlorides , sulfates, nitrates, and aliphatic carboxylic acid salts.Other salts, such as the carbonates, thiocyanates, sulfides, oxides and certain organometal compounds, such as copper acetyl acetonate and cupric ethylacetoacetate, also reduce the odor. Additionally, these copper salts, when added to the sulfur vulcanizable materials, result in vulcanized elastomers of increased thermal stability. Although not wishing to expound by any specific theory, it is believed that the method by which the various metal salts function to reduce malodor in polymers of thiodiethanol is through complexation with thioxane and dithiane which are believed to cause the malodor, as mentioned above.The resulting complexes have significantly reduced odor and, depending on the termal stability of the complex formed, control the odor even during processing of the polymer at elevated temperatures. Although some of the metal salts may discolor the polymers to some extent, which may, in some instances, be undesirable from a use standpoint, the metal salts are all effective to the extent that they reduce the malodor relative to that of the untreated polymer per se.Copper and zinc salts are preferred because they are the most effective in reducing malodor and also because they produce little or no discoloration in the polymer. Useful metal salts include, but are not limited to, the following cupric chloride bromide, iodide cupric acetate cupric sulfate cupric nitrate cupric formate cupric stearate cupric carbonate cupric octoate cupric naphthenate cupric acetyl acetonate cupric ethylacetoacetate cuprous chloride bromide, iodide cuprous oxide cuprous sulfide cuprous thiocyanate zinc chloride bromide, iodide zinc acetate zinc carbonate zinc formate zinc nitrate zinc phosphate zinc sulfate zinc sulfide cobaltic chloride bromide, iodide cobaltic oxide cobaltic sulfate cobaltic sulfide cobaltous chloride bromide, iodide cobaltous acetate cobaltous carbonate cobaltous nitrate cobaltous oxalate cobaltous oxide cobaltous sulfate cobaltous sulfide ferric chloride bromide, iodide ferric acetate ferric formate ferric nitrate ferric oxalate ferric oxide ferric sulfate ferrous chloride iodide, bromide ferrous acetate ferrous carbonate ferrous formate ferrous nitrate ferrous oxalate ferrous oxide ferrous sulfate nickel chloride bromide, iodide nickel acetate nickel carbonate nickel formate nickel nitrate nickel oxalate nickel oxide nickel phosphate nickel sulfate silver chloride bromide, iodide silver acetate silver nitrate silver oxalate silver oxide silver sulfate mercurous chloride bromide, iodide mercurous acetate mercurous nitrate mercurous oxide mercurous sulfate mercuric chloride bromide, iodide mercuric acetate mercuric carbonate mercuric formate mercuric nitrate mercuric oxide mercuric sulfate cadmium chloride bromide, iodide cadmium acetate cadmium carbonate cadmium formate cadmium nitrate cadmium oxide cadmium sulfate cadmium sulfide, and the corresponding aluminum, boron, bismuth, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, theómium, tin, iridium, platinum, gold etc. salts. B. The Polymers Thiodiethanol in major amount, i.e., at least about 50 mole percent, condenses with aliphatic saturated diols linear, branched chain or cyclic under the influence of heat and acidic dehydration catalysts, such as phosphorous acid, to provide low molecular weight, hydroxylterminated polyols, hereafter referred to as macroglycols.Thiodiethanol similarly homopolymerizes to form macroglycols if other diols are absent. These condensation reactions are well known, as described in the aforementioned references.The molecular weights of these macroglycols generally range from about 500 to 4000, but may reach d high as about 8000.The condensation reaction invariably produces, at least to some degree, malodorous by products, as discussed above.The molodor persists when the macroglycols are converted to elastomeric products. The preferred mac aglycoJs may be characterized by the Formula I EMI7.1 whereinEMI7.2 comprises structural knits 11 or randomly alternating structural units II and 1II EMI7.3 wherein R represents one or more radicals remaining on removal of two hydroxyl groups from saturated aliphatic linear, branched chain or cyclic diols m is an integer sufficient to provide in the polymer a molecular weight of up to about 8000 and the molar ratio of structural units II to structural units III in the copolymers is not less than about 1 1. The macroglycols I may be converted into useful elastomeric products in one of the following ways 1 The macroglycol may be reacted with a stoichiometric excess of a diisocyanate, preferably an aromatic diisocyanate such as tolylene diisocyanate or methylenebis phenyl isocyanate to provide isocyanate terminated interpolymers, usually referred to in the art as prepolymers, having isocyanate contents ranging from about 2 to 10 .The prepolymer can then be reacted chain extended with an aromatic diamine, such as methylenebis o chloroaniline , or a diol, such as the di hydròxyethyl ether of hydroquinone.These reaction products are the so called castable polyurethanes. When they are cured by heat in a mold, useful elastomeric products are obtained. 2 The macroglycol may be reacted with one or more aliphatic diols, e.g., 1,4 butanediol, and an aromatic diisocyanate in a manner such that the ratio of isocyanate groups to the total hydroxyl groups of the macroglycol plus diol is essentially 1 1 i.e., about 0.95 1 to 1.05 1 to produce a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer. Ordinarily a catalyst is used to promote the reaction, e.g., certain tin compounds. Thermoplastic elastomers may also be obtained by reacting the above mentioned isocyanateterminated prepolymers with an aliphatic diol at essentially stoichiometric levels, optionally in the presence of a catalyst. Sulfur vulcanizable elastomers of thiodiethanol are represented by the Formula IV EMI8.1 whereinEMI8.2 comprises randomly alternating structural units selected from A structural units II above, and V EMI8.3 wherein R is one or more radicals remaining on removal of two hydroxyl groups from a saturated aliphatic linear, branched chain or cyclic diols, or b aliphatic linear, branched chain or cyclic diols containing external unsaturation and having an allylic hydrogen atom and B structural units II , above, V , above, and VI EMI9.1 wherein R is one or more radicals remaining on removal of two hydroxyl groups from a diphenolic compound.The polymers comprising structural units A and B are characterized in that 1 x is an integer sufficient to provide in the polymer a molecular weight of at least about 8000 2 the molar ratio of structural units II to structural units V when the polymer comprises structural units A , or the molar ratio of structural units II to the total of structural units V and VI , when the polymer comprises structural units B , is not less than about 1 1 and 3 the polymers contain from 1 to 10 mole percent of diol b , based on the total of all units II , V and VI present in the polymer. These polymers are millable gums containing an external, i.e., pendant, double bond which is vulcanizable, e.g. with sulfur, to give useful elastomeric products. Thus, they may be compounded on conventional rubber processing equipment with vulcanizing agents, carbon black, other fillers, processing aids, etc., and cured in a mold at elevated temperatures. As indicated, all of the polymers of thiodiethanol described herein have some degree of malodor, which is markedly reduced by the addition thereto of a metal salt, as described. The method by which the metal salt is incorporated into the polymer normally is immaterial, however, preferred methods are as follows. When preparing an isocyanate terminated prepolymer, the metal salt is added to the macroglycol, prior to reacting with the diisocyanate, as an aqueous solution. The salt is thoroughly mixed into the macroglycol, and a vacuum is then applied at a temperature over 1000C to remove water. It is possible to add the metal salt to the ultimate prepolymer however, since water will react with the isocyanate groups, the metal salt must be substantially anhydrous. The preferred procedure is to add the metal salt to the macroglycol. The same procedure is used when preparing a thermoplastic polyurethane, except in this case the metal salt may be added to the macroglycol or to a mixture of the macroglycol and aliphatic diol. When the salts are added to the vulcanizable elastomers to decrease their odor or the copper salts are added to increase their thermal stability, it has been found beneficial to first prepare the thiodiethanol based elastomers by condensing thiodiethanol, or a mixture of a major proportion of thiodiethanol with one or more aliphatic diols, including about 1 to 10 mole percent of an unsaturated diol, optionally with a dihydroxy phenolic compound, in the presence of an acidic dehydrating catalyst, preferably phosphorous acid, at a temperature of about 150 to 2000C until a lowmolecular weight, hydroxyl terminated polymer is obtained.To this low molecular weight polymer is then added an additional catalyst, e.g., sulfuric acid, and the condensation reaction is continued at 175 2000C under vacuum in a highshear mixer, until the molecular weight exceeds about 8000, and a gum is obtained. The appropriate metal salt is then added to the elastomer following this build up of its molecular weight to the gum stage. The salt may be added as a powder and mixed into the gum in any convenient manner. Thus, it may be mixed into the gum using a high shear mixer, a dough or sigma mixer, on a rubber mill or in a Banbury mixer. Preferably, the salt is added at an elevated temperature in order to insure uniform distribution and solubility in the gum. Any temperature above about 500C up to the condensation temperature is useful, although it is preferable to add the salt at a temperature above 1000C. If the salt is added to the polymer prior to attaining a highmolecular weight gum, it may interfere with the condensation reaction with the result that a gum is either not readily obtained or the rate of reaction is significantly slowed. The gum, containing the salt, is then compounded in the same manner as conventional elastomers using standard rubber compounding techniques and cured in the conventional manner, preferably using one of the sulfur vulcanization systems described hereinabove. The effects of aging at elevated temperature are determined by exposing the vulcanized elastomer in air at 1500C for a period of 70 hours, and then determining the percent retention of the original tensile strength and elongation. Another measure of resistance to aging is compression set, determined after aging for 70 hours at 1500C. The amount of metal salt added to the thiodiethanol polymer will generally be dependent on the degree of malodor of the polymer or thermal instability of the elastomer and the particular metal salt used. Not all of the metal salts are equally effective in reducing malodor nor are all the copper salts equivalent in their ability to increase thermal stability. In general, from about 0.05 to about 10.0 parts of metal salt per hundred parts of the thiodiethanol polymer being exemplary. Preferably, the amount of metal salt will range from about 0.1 to about 7.0 part, per hundred, of polymer or from about 0.2 to about 7.0 parts, per hundred of vulcanizable elastomer. Mixtures of the salts at a concentration of the mixture within the above range may also be used. The following examples are set forth by way of illustration only and are not to be construed as limitations on the present invention except as set forth in the appended claims. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Examples 1 2 A hydroxyl terminated macroglycol having a molecular weight of about 2000 and prepared by the auto condensation of thiodiethanol in the presence of phosphorous acid, was analyzed and found to contain 0.19 percent thioxane and 0.027 percent dithiane. The macroglycol was slightly malodorous. Separate portions of the macroglycol were mixed at 50 600C with 1 0.3 percent, by weight, of mercuric chloride and 2 0.15 percent, by weight, of cuprous chloride both as aqueous solutions . The salt solutions were thoroughly mixed into the macroglycol and the macroglycol was then dehydrated under vacuum. Malodor was markedly reduced. Analyses of the polymers gave the following results Treatment Control Example 1 Example 2 Blank 0.3 EgC 12 0.15 CuCl thioxane 0.19 0.097 0.015 dithiane 0.027 0.038 0.019 odor slight none none The data show that CuCI and HgC12 are very effective in reducing odor and that thioxane is the principal malodorous compound. Examples 3 6 A homopolymer of thiodiethanol 0.41 mole , prepared by auto condensation in the presence of 0.2 phosphorous acid catalyst, was mixed with 0.15 mole of thiodiethanol monomer and further condensed to give a macroglycol having a molecular weight of about 1300. The macroglycol was stirred at 90 1000C with 0.2 calcium oxide to neutralize the acid catalyst and 5 water for 3 hours. After removal of residual low molecluar weight compounds, which are malodorous, by steam distillation at 1800C, the macroglycol was dried under vacuum at 100 1200C. To separate portions of the macroglycol which remains malodorous was added 0.08 of each of the following metal salts as aqueous solu tions Example 3. Cupric chloride CuC12 Example 4. Cupric sulfate CuSO4 Example 5. Nickel chloride NiC12 Example 6.Ferric chloride FeC13 Vacuum was again applied to remove the water. The resulting macroglycols exhihited a marked reduction in malodor. The macroglycols were then reacted with methylenebis phenylisocyanate at a NCO OH ratio of about 2.43 1 to give isocyanate terminated prepolymers having significantly reduced odor when compared to those having no metal salt therein. Example 7 A homopolymer of thiodiethanol was prepared in the presence of 0.2 phosphorous acid and the catalyst then neutralized with calcium oxide in the manner described inExample 3. The polymer was distinctly malodorous. To 90 ml of the viscous macroglycol was added a mixture of 0.5 of zinc chloride and 0.5 part of hydrated cupric chloride.The mixture was heated at 1050C for 2 hours, then 4 ml of water was added at 700C. The temperature was raised to 100 CC and a vacuum was applied to remove the water. The odor of the macroglycol was substantially improved. Example 8 Cuprous chloride 0.3 part was mixed with 75 ml of the macroglycol of Example 7 and heated for about 2.5 hours at 1050C. No water was added to the mixture, the cuprous chloride being only partially soluble in the macroglycol. The undissolved fraction of CuCl was filtered off.The odor of the macroglycol was improved. Example 9 Example 8 was repeated except that 5 ml of water was added to help dissolve the salt. The mixture was dried under vacuum for about 30 minutes. The odor of the macroglycol was remarkably improved. In both examples 8 and 9, a slight discoloration was imparted to the macroglycol. Examples 10 11 Following the procedure of Example 7, 0.44 part of 10 cupric chloride was added to 75 ml of polythiodiethanol along with 5 ml of water. The mixture was heated at 1050C for 1.5 hours and then dried under vacuum. The reduction in odor was greater than with cuprous chloride and there was no discoloration. Similar results were obtained when 0.5 part of 11 cupric sulfate and 5 ml of water were added. Examples 12 13 Following the procedure of Example 7, 0.3 part of 12 ferric chloride and 4 ml of water were added to the polymer. A slight yellow discoloration was imparted but odor was greatly reduced. Similar odor reduction was acheived by the addition of 0.3 part of 13 cupric acetate plus 3 ml of water. Examples 14 17 Following the procedure of Example 7, one part of 14 cupric bromide in 10 ml of water was added to the polymer. The resulting polymer had reduced odor. Similar results were obtained using one part of 15 cadmium chloride in 10 ml of water one part of 16 silver nitrate in 8.5 ml of water and 0.5 part of 17 copper stearate in 9 ml of benzene. Example 18 1,4 Butanediol 4 moles was mixed with 0.1 percent by weight of cupric acetate monohydrate and heated at about 1100C until the salt dissolved. Then, one mole of polythiodiethanol mol wt 2000 was added and the mixture of diols stirred at 1000C for about 15 minutes. To this mixture was added 5.2 moles of methylenebis phenylisocyanate and the mixture stirred for a short time. Stannous octoate 0.1 catalyst was added, stirred in for about 15 seconds, and the mixture transferred to trays having a non stick surface and cured for one hour at 1200C. The cured thermoplastic was granulated and injection molded barrel temperature 3900F front 4000F center 4100F at the die . There was no malodor evident during or after the molding operation. Polymer prepared in the absence of the cupric salt had an intolerable odor. Example 19 A polymer of 77 thiodiethanol 15 diethylene glycol 8 trimethylol propane monoallyl ether having a molecular weight of about 2000 and prepared at a temperature of about 1900C in the presence of 0.25 phosphorous acid, was mixed with 0.04 sulfuric acid as a 4M solution and condensed at 1900C and 5 mm until the desired elastomeric gum was obtained. The gum was cooled to about 1500C and 0.5 cuprous chloride was added based on the weight of the polymer as an anhydrous powder. The gum was mixed at about 150 1700C for about 15 minutes and then under vacuum for about 0.5 hour. When the gum was discharged from the mixer, there was very little odor detectable. Similar results were obtained using 0.98 cupric chloride. A similar gum, prepared without the metal salt treatment, was highly malodorous. Examples 20 30 When the procedure of Example 19 was again followed except that the cuprous chloride was replaced by equivalent amounts of 20 cobaltous acetate, 21 zinc oxide, 22 nickel carbonate, 23 cupric sulfide, 24 cobalt acetyl acetonate, 25 cobalt ethyl acetoacetate, 26 silver chloride, 27 cadmium sulfate, 28 ferrous nitrate, 29 cupric oxide, and 30 zinc sulfide, a definite reduction of the malodorous nature of the gum was achieved as compared to the gum having no added salt. Example 31 A portion of the elastomer of Example 19 100 parts to which contains 0.5 of cuprous chloride was compounded with 50 parts of carbon black, 5 parts of calcium oxide, one part of sulfur, 2 parts of triethylene tetramine stearate, and one part of decahydropyrazino 2,3 b pyrazine.The compounded elastomer was cured for 30 minutes at 1760C, then post cured for 16 hours at 1200C in an air oven. Separate specimens were air aged for 70 hours at 1500C and compared to the elastomer containing no copper salt. The following properties were obtained Control no CuCl 0.5 CuClOriginal Aged Retention Original Aged RetentionTensile, psi 1525 790 52 1500 1310 88Elongation, 260 90 35 275 150 55Compression Set, 80 55 70 hrs commat 150 C The data illustrate that cuprous chloride retards deterioration of the elastomer on aging, as evidenced by a high retention of tensile and elongation properties and reduced compression set compared with the control containing no cuprous chloride.
