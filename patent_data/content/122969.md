IMMOBILIZED OLIGOPEPTIDESThe present invention is directed to a new modified matrix characterized in that an oligopeptide chain is linked, directly or by means of spacer arms , to a suitable water insoluble carrier.The new modified matrix can be represented by the following formula A B R CO D Ala Z wherein A represents a water insoluble carrier, B represents a bond, a spacer arm, or a polyaminoacidic residue,R represents a straight or branched Cl Cl2 alkylene substituted amino or oxy group of formulae HN C1 C12 alkylene and O Cl C12 alkylene respectively, and preferably a straight or branched C2 C6 alkylene substituted amino or oxy group of formulae HN C2 C6 alkyleneand 0 C2 C6 alkylene, respectively, or R CO represents a L lysinyl residue, or a bond or a OC CH2 nCO group wherein n is an integer from 1 to 6 inclusive, and preferably 2, 3r or 4 Z represents an aminoacidic residue selected from D alanyl, glycinyl, andD leucinyl and D ala represents a D alanyl group with the proviso that when R CO represents a bond B is a group having a carboxy terminal function that links the amino function of the D alanine, or in the case both RCO and B represent a bond, A is a water insoluble carrier having a carboxy terminal function that links the amino function of the D alanine through a peptidic bond.In the framework of the present invention, the term water insoluble carrier11 represents any water insoluble carrier or matrix which can be bonded to a RCO D Ala Z group, hereinafter, the ligand or QL 1, directly or through a spacer arm.The term modified matrix11 generally indicates the immobilized oligopeptide of the invention, while the term matrix per se is used as a synonimous for nwater inso luble carrierIt was found that one of the critical parameters in the modified matrix of the present invention is the specificity of the ligand for the substrate, i.e. the selectivity of the target antibiotic for the immobilized peptide , while the matrix as such has a non critical role.The carrier must be insoluble in the solvents and buffers to be employed, it must be mechanically and chemically stable with good flow properties, it must be easily coupled to the ligand or to the 11spacer arm onto which the ligand may be attached, and it should have a large surface area accessible to the substrate to be adsorbed.Said matrices include single composition matrices such as agarose, glass, cellulose, and the like, and dual composition or chemically modified matrices, such as agarose coated polyacrylamide, polyacrylic coated iron particles, glycidoxy coated glasses and the like. Examples of water insoluble carriers are those having hydroxy, amine or carbonyl groups or halogen atoms.Examples of water insoluble carriers having hydroxy groups are polysaccharides e.g. cellulose, agarose, cross linked dextran, and the like hydroxyalkylpolystyrene resins e.g. hydroxyalkylated styrene divinylbenzene copolymer, and the like polyvinylalcohols or the like. Examples of the water insoluble carriers having an amino group are aminoalkylpolysaccharides e.g.aminoalkylcellulose such as aminoethylcellulose or aminohexylcellulose, aminoalkylagarose such as aminohexylagarose, and the like , p aminobenzylpolysaccharides e.g. p aminobenzylcellulose, p aminobenzylagarose, and the like , chitosan, aminoalkylpolystyrene resins e.g., aminoalkylated styrene divinylbenzene copolymer , polyacrylamides, and aminoalkylpolyacrylamides e. g. aminoethylpolyacrylamide, and the like , and aminoalkyl porous glasses e.g. aminopropyl porous glass, and the like . Examples of water insoluble carriers having a carboxyl group are carboxyalkylpolysaccharides e.g. carboxyalkylagarose such as carboxyhexylagarose or carboxypentylagarose, carboxyalkylcellulose such as carboxymethylcellulose, carboxyalkyl cross linked dextran such as carboxymethyl cross linked dextrin, and the like , carboxyalkylpolyacrylamides e.g. carboxymethylpolyacrylamide, and the like , and carboxylic acid resins e.g. acrylic acid divinylbenzene copolymer, and the like . Examples of the water insoluble carriers having a halogen atom are halogenoalkylpolystyrene resins e.g.chloromethylated styrene divinylbenzene copolymer . When a halogenoalkylpolystyrene is used, it can be used as it is or it can be converted into a more activated form. For example, a halogenoalkylpolystyrene resin can be conver ted into a dialkylthioalkylpolystyrene r in having activity higher than that of the halogenoalkylpolystyrene resin by reacting the resin with dialkyl sulfide.When the water insoluble carrier possesses functional groups that can directly link to the ligand, the ligand can be directly linked to the matrix, i.e. in the above formula, B represents a bond , however, it is in some instances preferred to link the matrix to the ligand through a spacer arm which is interposed between the carrier and the ligand to facilitate their effective binding. Representative examples of such spacer arms are the residues of formulae EN 2 m o C 2 mCO HN CH2 mCO , or wherein m represents an integer from 1 to 12 inclusive preferably from 2 to 6, and most preferably 4.The npolyaminoacidic residue , which is one of the possible meanings for B, represents a sequence of aminoacidic groups linked each other through a peptidic bond CO NH . The aminoacid can be one of the known alpha aminoacids, and the average number of aminoacid units per chain is from about 2 to about 15 or more and preferably from 2 to 6. Most preferably, this polyaminoacidic residue is a poly D Ma residue of 2 15 D Ala units.Examples of straight or branched C1 Cl2Xalkylene groups are Cl Cl2 methylene groups, or Cl Cl2 methylene groups wherein a hydrogen atom of one or more of the methylene groups is substituted by a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and the like. Preferred embodiments of the invention are represented by those modified matrix of the invention wherein the matrix i.e. the water insoluble carrier is a cross linked dextran, cellulose or carboxymethylcellulose, controlled pore glass or derivatized glass e.g. silanized or glycidoxy controlled pore glass, long chain alkylamine glass, aminopropyl glass, carboxyl glass, and the like , agarose, or derivatized agarose e.g N hydroxysuccinimide active esters of cross linked agarose, carboxy terminal agarose, amino terminal agarose, and the like , or polyacrylamide gels such as aminoethylpolyacrylamide which have functions that can link to free amino groups i.e.. functional derivatives having oxirane HC CH2 , carboxy COOR1, wherein R1 represents hydrogen, Cl C3 alkyl, chloro, bromo or amino , halogen chloro or bromo and similar groups .The spacer arm, when present, is H2N CH2 mCOOH, wherein m is as above, and the oligopeptidic ligand is a D alanyl D alanine dipeptide bonded to the carrier by means of a peptidic bond between the carboxy terminal function of a functionalized carrier and the free amino group of the dipeptide, or the ligand is poly D alanine containing an average number of units of about 2 to 15. A further preferred embodiment of the invention is a modified matrix wherein the carrier is carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose, porous glass, controlled pore glass, cross linked dextrans, agarose, carboxymethylagarose, the oligopeptidic ligand is poly D alanine and the bond between the carrier and the ligand is obtained by means of cyanogen bromide, epichlorohydrin, 1,4 bis 2,3 diepoxypropoxy3butane or 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIt is known that some antibiotics act by interfering with the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall.More particularly, penicillins, cephalosporins and other beta lactams prevent the maturation of the peptidoglycan by inhibiting the cross linking reaction trough inhibition of transpeptidases and carboxypeptidases bacitracin A blocks the phosphorylase that liberates one of the two terminal phosphates from the lipid carrier involved in the transport of the muramylpentapeptide through the cell membrane from the cytoplasm to the outside as a consequence of this block the lipid carrier can no longer function as an acceptor of muramylpentapeptide see G. Lancini. F. Parenti, The antibiotics ,Springer Verlag, N.Y., 1982, pp.42 48 . Vancomycin andRistocetin A interfere with the peptidoglycan which is the main structural component of bacterial cell walls biosynthesis.It is tought hat this interference, which leads to the inhibition of cell growth and, eventually, to the distruction of the cell by lysis, is due to specific binding between these antibiotics and the pentapeptide precursor having a D Ala D Ala residue at the carbonyl terminus UDP N Acetylmuramylpentapeptide .it was recently discovered that also Teicoplanin formerly Teichomycin, U.S. Patent No. 4,239,751 acts the same way by linking to the growing cell wall of bacteria. More particularly it was found that Teicoplaning like Vancomycin and Ristocetin A and similar antibiotics links to mucopeptides terminating inD Ala D Ala. By doing so, they probably inhibit the transpeptidase activity and prevent cross linking of the cell wall. INN International Non Proprietary Name SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt has now been found that synthetic analogues of such a ligand portion can be successfully coupled to an insoluble carrier and used to selectively adsorb the target antibiotic i.e. the antibiotic substance that selectively binds to the ligand . Therefore the present invention is directed to a new insolubilized ligand capable of selectively adsorbing antibiotic substance and to the methods of using the same for binding the target antibiotics.Thus, one embodiment of the invention is the use of said insolubilized ligand for purifying a target antibiotic from mixture containing it.It is in fact well known in the art that one of the major problems to be solved in the recovery of an antibiotic substance, for instance from the fermentation broths, is its recovery in a substantially pure form and in a high yield.Some times the contaminants are of the same nature as the substance to be purified, i.e. possess chemico and physical properties very similar to it, and therefore the separation process is very difficult. This purification is oftentimes obtained through numerous and time consuming steps, that in many cases considerably reduce the overall yield. On the contrary, by using the modified matrix of the present invention, a purified solution of a target antibiotic i.e. an antibiotic which selectively binds to the modified matrix is obtained often in a single step procedure.In some instances, however, due to the nature and amount of the contaminants, a higher degree of purity is obtained by submitting the obtained purified solution to a further purification step, by repeating the same operations or by using another purification technic such as liquid liquid chromatography, e.g. a ion exchange chromatography, a preparative HPLC, a precipitation by non solvent and the like.Therefore, according to the present invention and by using the immobilized ligand herein described, it is possible to selectively adsorb a certain antibiotic, separating it from a mixture containing it.Another embodiment of the invention is the use of the immobilized ligand to screen for antibiotics capable of selectively binding to the ligand. In fact, since the ligand is a synthetic analog of a peptidic chain which is present in the cell wall of bacteria and it is demonstrated that the antibiotics so far known to link to such peptidic chain possess antimicrobial activity at least against gram positive bacteria, the immobilized ligand of the invention can be used to screen for antibiotics having this mechanism of action.Moreover, the fact that the immobilized ligand of the invention selectively adsorb a certain antibiotic is of considerable importance also for assay methods for said antibiotic, not only in simple aqueous solutions, but also in biological fluids. In fact, the numerous proteinaceous contaminant of a biological fluid, such as urine or blood, are not selectively adsorbed onto the immobilized ligand only the target antibiotic is. After rinsing with a buffer, the antibiotic can then be eluted, for instance by using another buffer at a different pH, and assayed according to the usual techniques.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONA general view of the coupling of the water insoluble carriers to the ligands through the introduction of a spacer arm can be found in reference books such as C.R.Lowe and P.G.D. Dean Affinity Chromatography , JohnWiley and Sons Inc. N.Y. 1974 and W.H. Southen, AffinityChromatography , John Wiley and Sons Inc. N.Y. 1981.For example, when a carrier having a hydroxy group hereinafter shown as A OH orEMI9.1 is used, the carrier is activated for example with a cyanogen halide such as cyanogen bromide , a monoepoxide such as epichlorohydrin , a bioxirane such as 1,4 bis 2,3 epoxypropoxy butane , a halogenoacetyl halide such as chloroacetyl chloride and then the resulting activated carrier is reacted with the ligand which has a free amino group, or the ligand which is linked to a spacer arm having a free amino group hereinafter both compounds are represented by NH2 or the above activated carrier is reacted with the ligand having a free hydroxy group or the ligand which is linked to a spacer arm having a free hydroxy group hereinafter both compounds are represented by OH . According to these processes the adsorbents of the following formulae can be obtained EMI9.2 EMI10.1 A O CH2 CH OH CH2NH A O CH2CH OH CH2 CH2 m CH2CH OH CH2NH A O CH2CONH A 0 COCH2NH A O CH2CH OH CH2 0112 whereinAand areasaboveandmisanintegerofl to 16. When the water insoluble carrier having an amino group hereinafter shown as A NH2 is used, 1 the carrier is activated with an aliphatic dialde hyde e.g. glutaraldehyde ,the activated carrier is reacted with a free amino containing ligand NH2 and then the resulting Shiff base is reduced with a reducing agent e.g. sodium boro hydride 2 the carrier is reacted with a free carboxy contai ning ligand Q COOH , i.e. a ligand having a carboxylic function in excess to that of Z group or a ligand into which a spacer arm having said carbo xylic group has been introduced 3 the carrier is activated Ath cyanuric halide cyanuric bromide and then the resulting activated carrier is reacted with a ligand of formula 4 the carrier is activated with a monoepoxide or bisepoxide and then the resulting activated carrier is reacted with the ligand of formula or OH, wherein OH and NH2 are as defined above 5 the carrier is diazotized and then reacted with the ligand of formula L NH2According to the process, the adsorbents of the following formulae can be obtained A NHCH2 CH2 mCH2 NH A NH CO G A NH CH2CH OH CH2NH A NH CH2 CH OH Cf 2 o A NH CH2CH OH CH2 CH2 mCH2CH OH CH NH A N N o wherein , A, and m are as defined above.When the water insoluble carrier having a carboxy group hereinafter A COOH is used, the carrier is reacted with a ligand of formula NH2 to form an acid amide. According to this process, the adsorbent of the following formula is obtained A CONH wherein A and arse as above defined.When the carrier having a halogen atom hereinafter A halol is used, the carrier can be reacted with the ligand of formulae 2 OH, or G COOH According to this process, the adsorbents of the following formulae can be obtained A NH A OOC wherein A and are as above definedThe above formulae are not intended to a deine stoichiometric balance among the components, since the variations in the ratio of the components, i.e. carrier, ligand, spacer arm , the way in which they are coupled and the actual sequence of the coupling operations can give polymers and cross linked modified matrices essentially having the properties defined in the present application and which are therefore encompassed by the scope of the present invention that can ultimately differ from the above schematic formulae in stoichiometric or structural aspects.The water insoluble carriers of the invention include also a number of commercially available functionalized matrices that can be conveniently used for preparing the modified matrixes of tl invention according to the techniques herein described or in any case known per se to the man skilled in the art. Examples of said matrices are Sepharose Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden , Affi Gel t 202,Affi Gel 10 and ii Bio Rad Inc., U.S.A. , Eupergit Rohm Pharma, Weiterstadt, West Germany and the like.These functional derivatives are capable of directly linking to the RCO D Ala Z terminus without any interposed spacers.In the adsorbent of the present invention the ligand is preferably bonded in an amount of about 2 300 Fmol per 1 g wet form of the adsorbent . Wet form means wet weight of adsorbent obtained after filtering its aqueous suspension.An antibiotic containing solution to be contacted with the adsorbent preferably has a pH value of about 7 8.5.However, antibiotic solutions having a pH lower than 7 can also be used, at least in some instances.When contacting a substrate containing solution with the adsorbent, either a continuous process using e.g. a column or a batchwise process, using the adsorbent in bulk , can be employed.For example, when a column is used the adsorbent may be packed in the column and washed with a salt solution, water, and a buffer solution then a substrate containing solution is passed through the column to selectively adsorb the target antibiotic on it, the system is then rinsed with the above buffer solution, and finally the adsorbed antibiotic is released from the adsorbent by eluting, for instance, with a buffer of different pH. The so obtained antibiotic is in a purified form, substantially free from many of the original contaminants.Preferably the first buffer solution has a pH between about 7 and 8.5, while the second buffer the elution buffer , has a pH higher than 10 and most preferably of about 1Q to about 11.5.On the other hand, when a batchwise process is carried out, a substrate containing solution is added to a suspension of the adsorbent, the resulting mixture is buffered at a pH between 2.5 and 8.5 and preferably at a pH value of 7 8.5 and stirred to selectively adsorb the target antibiotic on the adsorbent and then, after having recovered and rinsed the target antibiotic bearing adsorbent, the target antibiotic is recovered in a purified form by releasing it from the adsorbent by means of a buffer at pH higher than 10, and preferably at a pH between 10 and 11.5.The ratio between the antibiotic containing solution and the adsorbent to be contacted depends on various parameters such as the total amount of target antibiotic in the solution, the specific adsorbent used, the selected working conditions, in particular the concentration of the target antibiotic and the kind and amount of contaminants. However these range finding operations are in the range of activity of the skilled technician on the basis of what disclosed in the present application.The following examples illustrate the manner in which the invention can be practiced but, as such, should not be construed as limiting its overall scope.

The affinity constants as calculated according to the above described experiments are listed in the table below TABLE 5Antibiotic Ka l x Mole Teicoplanin 8.08 x 10 5 0.13Vancomycin 1.53 x 10 5 t 0. 36 Ristocetin A 4.68 x 10 0.705 The above experiments repeated substituting Sephadex aminocaproyl L alanyl L alanine for Sephadex s amino caproyl D alanyl D alanine show that there is no binding between the modified matrix and any of the test antibiotics. In particular, the whole amount of Teicoplanin, Vancomycin and Risto cetin A is found in the supernatant. EXAMPLE 4 SELECTIVE BINDING OF A TARGET ANTIBIOTIC ANDITS PURIFICATION. Teicoplanin solutions of different antibiotic content purity about 70 are applied to chroma tography columns 0.8 x 1.5 cm prepared with the modified matrix obtained according to example 1 A. The column is pre equilibrated with 0.15 M sodium chloride and 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at room temperature. The column is then washed with the same buffer and when assayed for Teicoplanin, the collected fractions show a trace content of the antibiotic, while after the elution with 0.15M sodium chloride and sodium phosphate buffer pH 11.5 flow rate 6 ml h the eluted fractions contain about 90 97 of the initial amount of Teicoplanin. The following table summarizes the experimental data. TABLE 6EXPERIMENT NO. TEICOPLANIN CONTENT mug RECOVERY S.A.

A fermentation broth obtained by culturing Actinoplanes teichomyceticus ATCC 31121 as described in U.S. Patent 4,239,751 Teicoplanin purity 5 of the dry material pH 8.3 , is applied to a chroma tography column wherein the selective adsorbent is the glass poly D alanine of example 1 D 2.8 cm x 11 cm . The column is prepared with O.05M sodium citrate, 0.lN sodium chloride buffer at pH 8.3. After allo wing the substrate to be selectively adsorbed to the matrix, the column is rinsed with the above buffer diluted four times in water. The selectively adsor bed substrate is then eluted using 3 . ammonia pH about 11.5 flow rate about 160 mlJh . The eluted fractions are monitored in continuo and assayed for the presence of Teicoplanin using a Uvicord SVKB spectrophotometer at 280 nm . The fractions containing it are immediately neutralized, pooled and the antibiotic content is determined.

Determination of Teicoplanin in the urines. Each urine sample is adjusted at pH 7.4 by means of lN hydrochloric acid or lN sodium hydroxide. In case opalescence or a precipitate forms, it is removed by filtering after centrifugation. Urine samples containing approximately 100 pg of Teicoplanin are diluted to 10 ml with a. 05 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M sodium chloride, at pH 7.4. The test tubes used are glass tubes treated with 5 dichlorodimethyl silane in toluene for 30 minutes, and completely washed with methanol and anhydrous ethyl ether. The samples containing approximately less than 10 pg ml of Teicoplanin are kept undiluted.Following the same procedure, 1Q ml samples containing 10 pg ml of Teicoplanin are prepared standard solutions . A homogeneous suspension 1 1 of CH Sepharose 4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals prepared as described in example 1 A, in the same buffer as above 0.5 ml , is added to each sample. The mixture is gently stirred for about 1 hour. Then the samples are centrifuged 5 minutes x 4000 r.p.m. and, after having discarded the supernatant, resuspended in 10 ml of buffer. Each sample is again centrifuged as above and the supernatant is again discarded leaving the resin in about 0.5 ml of solution.The antibiotic selectively adsorbed to the resin is eluted by treating with 0.05 sodium phosphate buffer at pH 11.6, using 50 pg ml orcinol as the internal standard. The mixture is gently stirred for about 30 minutes, then the resin is eliminated by centrifugation and the supernatant is neutralized with lN HCl 50 ml . The analysis is carried out according to the HPLC method already described, using a solution ofTeicoplanin of the same content as the standard solution to serve as the blank i.e. a sample which is assayed in parallel with the other samples, but which is not added to the resin .The following Tables summarize the experimental data TABLE 10Experiment No. Recovery of Teicoplanin from urines 1 73.8 2 72.5 3 74 4 78 average recovery 74.58 TABLE 11 Experiment No. Recovery of Teicoplanin from the standard solution 1 76.5 2 71.6 3 72.8 4 88.1 5 75.4 6 81.4 average recovery 77.6
