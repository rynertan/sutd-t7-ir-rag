## Description
The present invention relates to a process for producing a novel thermoplastic resin which is capable ofhaving good chemical resistance, excellent impact resistance and excellent processability. Polymers composed of a rubbery polymer onto which are grafted an alkenyl aromatic compound andan unsaturated nitrile for example ABS resins have been widely used in many fields, for example inelectrical goods, in interior and exterior trim of cars, in office appliances and in many other articles, sincethese polymers have excellent mechanical properties and moulding processability. Moreover, these polymers are widely used where chemical resistance is required, although they areoften coated in order to improve their appearance or to compensate for their low weather resistance whenthey are used outdoors. In particular, such polymers are used together with urethane films as structuralmaterials for constructing certain internal parts of refrigerators. However, various problems have recentlyoccurred in these uses, which means that higher chemical resistance of such polymers is now required. In general. ABS resins and similar polymers have good adhesion to paints and affinity to thinners accordingly, coatings can easily be formed on such resins. As a result of this, moulded articles of ABSresins are often coated with urethane paints or with acrylic paints. Urethane paints have superior chemical resistance to acrylic paints. However, if the coating film ofurethane has not completely solidified, chemical resistance is inadequate for example, when a defectiveportion of a coated product is coated again, the original coating film swells and peels hereinafter referred toas lifting , which changes the surface of the coating film and reduces the commercial value of theproduct. To counter this, an amine catalyst is often added to promote solidification of the paint, but thisshortens the life of the urethane coating and increases its cost. Furthermore, the coating conditions arechanged. However, the real problem is that it restricts conditions of use and workability of the product. ABS and similar resins are often used as interior materials for the box bodies of refrigerators. In thiscase, a urethane foam insulator is placed between the inner box and the outer housing, as a result of whichthe inner box comes into contact with the starting materials used to produce the polyurethane foam,specifically an isocyanate compound, a polyol compound and a fluorocarbon foaming agent, such as thosesold under the trade mark Freon. These starting materials chemically erode the resin, thereby greatlydecreasing its strength. Accordingly, a fluorocarbon gas resistant film is often provided on one surface ofthe inner box on the side contacting the fluorocarbon gas to prevent erosion by this gas. However, this notonly complicates the production of the refrigerator box body, but it also has the effect of separating theurethane foam from the face of the box body, with the result that the structure of the box body does notbecome integrated and the inner box is insufficiently fixed. EP A 81761 relates to a thermoplastic composition containing The shell B is prepared in two steps in the first step monomer b We have now discovered a process for preparing a thermoplastic resin which is capable of havingexcellent resistance to lifting and excellent resistance to attack by fluorocarbon gas foaming agents hereinafter referred to as special chemical resistance . The resin can also have good impact resistanceand processability. This is achieved by a stepwise graft copolymerisation of a mixture of an unsaturatednitrile compound and an alkenyl aromatic compound in the presence of a rubbery polymer latex, theproportion of unsaturated nitrile compound being varied between the steps. The present invention provides a process for producing a thermoplastic resin by polymerising amonomer mixture of an ethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomer and an alkenyl aromaticmonomer in the presence of a rubbery polymer latex, selected from the group consisting ofpolybutadiene, acrylonitrile butadiene copolymers, styrene butadiene copolymers, isoprene rubber,chloroprene rubber, and ethylene propylene diene rubbers, characterised in that i the monomermixture essentially consists, as the only copolymerisable monomers, of the two said monomers and ii the polymerisation is effected in at least two steps US A 3367995 describes a composition, differing in detail of composition from that defined in thepresent application. It is concerned with oil resistance properties. Such properties are different fromresistance to fluorocarbon gases, since the size, shape and surface interaction of oil molecules as distinctfrom fluorocarbon gas molecules are totally different. GB A 2044782 states that nitrile resins with relatively high unsaturated nitrile content excel in gasbarrier properties and chemical resistance. It is not however a teaching of the ranges now claimed nor ofthe particular resistance to fluorocarbon gas achieved thereby. GB A 1482143 requires additional starting monomers non conjugated diolefin and meth acrylic ester and uses the composition in packaging applications. The present invention sets out to use the resin inmolded products of specific chemical resistance to freon gas i. e. fluorocarbons, on which topic the prior anis silent. The rubberypolymers or a mixture of two or more thereof may be used. The latex may have been prepared by aconventional emulsion polymerisation method or by re emulsification of one or more of these polymerswhich had previously been prepared. The monomers used for producing the graft copolymer of the present invention are an unsaturatednitrile monomer and an alkenyl aromatic monomer. The unsaturated nitrile is preferably a lover alkenylnitrile, such as acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile. The alkenyl aromatic monomer is preferably an alkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon monomer, optionallyhaving one or more substituents preferably halogen atoms and or alkoxy groups on the aromatic moiety.Examples of such alkenyl aromatic monomers include styrene. α methylstyrene, The process of the invention may be carried out by any conventional technique applicable to this typeof graft copolymerisation reaction, for example by a conventional emulsion polymerisation process, i.e. byemulsion graft polymerising a monomer mixture of the unsaturated nitrile monomer and the alkenyl aromaticmonomer in the presence of the aforesaid rubbery polymer latex. In the process of the invention, it is preferred to employ from 95 to 40 parts by weight, more preferablyfrom 80 to 40 parts by weight, of the monomer mixture comprising the unsaturated nitrile monomer and thealkenyl aromatic monomer and from 5 to 60 parts by weight as solids , more preferably from 20 to 60parts by weight as solids , of the rubbery polymer latex, the total of the rubbery polymer latex and themonomer mixture being 100 parts by weight. If the amount of rubbery polymer is less than 5 parts byweight, the impact resistance of the resulting thermoplastic resin is inadequate on the other hand, if theamount of rubbery polymer exceeds 60 parts by weight, recovery of the resin as a powder becomesdifficult. Moreover, outside the range of from 5 to 60 parts by weight of rubbery polymer latex, it is difficultto achieve good physical properties and an appropriate balance of fluidity and impact resistance in theresulting graft copolymer and such graft copolymers are difficult to knead uniformly when they are blendedwith other thermoplastic resins or with acrylonitrile styrene copolymers AS resins . The whole monomer mixture employed in the process of the present invention preferably consists offrom 25 to 40 by weight of the unsaturated nitrile monomer and from 75 to 60 by weight of the alkenylaromatic monomer including any other copolymerisable monomer that may have been used in place ofpart of the alkenyl aromatic monomer . In order to enhance the impact resistance and solvent resistance ofthe eventual graft copolymer, the amount of unsaturated nitrile monomer is preferably at least 25 byweight however, if this amount exceeds 40 by weight, other defects appear, which may not always beacceptable, for example processability and impact resistance deteriorate and discolouration tends to occurduring high temperature moulding. In order to impart special chemical resistance to the graft copolymer, it is important that the monomermixture employed in the first step a should have an unsaturated nitrile monomer content of from 0 to 18 by weight, and where there is more than one step a , the unsaturated nitrile content of the monomermixture in each such step should be within this range. Moreover, the amount of monomer mixturepolymerised in step a should be from 30 to 70 by weight, preferably from 30 to 60 by weight, of thewhole monomer mixture. In the second and subsequent steps b , the remainder of the monomer mixture,having an unsaturated nitrile monomer content averaged over all of steps b , where there is more than onesuch step of from 35 to 90 by weight, preferably from 40 to 70 by weight, is polymerised. When the unsaturated nitrile monomer content in the monomer mixture employed in step a exceeds18 by weight, the special chemical resistance deteriorates. When the amount of monomer mixtureemployed in this step is less than 30 by weight of the whole monomer mixture, the special chemicalresistance will not generally be improved on the other hand, if the amount is too much, the stability of thelatex during polymerisation is reduced. If the unsaturated nitrile monomer content in the monomer mixture employed in the second andsubsequent steps b , when the remainder of the monomer mixture is polymerised, is less than 35 byweight, the special chemical resistance deteriorates where this content is too high, polymerisation conversion is reduced and the fluidity deteriorates. If the resulting graft copolymer is blended with an ASresin having a high unsaturated nitrile monomer content in order to compensate for the reduced chemicalresistance, the two polymers have poor compatibility and it is difficult to knead them uniformly. Polymerisation in steps a and b of the graft copolymerisation reaction of the invention may becarried out in a conventional manner by adding monomers, initiators and the like all at once or by addingthem in portions or continuously. The partition of the monomers for portion wise addition is not critical,provided that the unsaturated nitrile monomer content of the monomer composition falls within the rangesprescribed for the present invention. Provided that the unsaturated nitrile monomer content in the part of the polymer formed by polymerisationof the monomer mixture in the resulting thermoplastic resin is in the range from 28 to 38 byweight, a good balance of physical properties, including special chemical resistance, impact resistance andprocessability, can be achieved. Any emulsifier which is capable of use in conventional emulsion polymerisation reactions may beemployed in the process of the present invention. Examples of such emulsifiers include alkali metal salts offatty acids, alkali metal salts of aliphatic sulphates and disproportionated alkali metal rosinates. A wide range of radical polymerisation initiators may be employed in the process of the invention,including water soluble initiators, such as potassium persulphate or ammonium persulphate oil solubleinitiators consisting of an organic peroxide alone, such as cumene hydroperoxide, benzoyl peroxide, lauroylperoxide, paramenthane peroxide or t butyl hydroperoxide or a redox system initiator consisting of one ormore of the aforementioned organic peroxides in association with a reducing agent, particularly an iron saltsuch as ferrous sulphate. In the latter case, the iron salt may also contain an auxiliary reducing agent or achelating agent, as in the sugar containing pyrophosphoric acid recipe or the sulphoxylate recipe. Furthermore,a polymerisation regulator may be used, if desired, for example a mercaptan, such as octylmercaptan, dodecyl mercaptan, t dodecyl mercaptan or mercaptoethanol a terpene or terpene mixture, forexample a mixture consisting of dipentene, terpinolene, γ terpinene and a small amount of other cyclicterpenes or a halogen compound. The thermoplastic resin obtained by the process of the invention may be employed by itself or it maybe mixed with other resins, particularly other impact resistant thermoplastic resins, including rubber reinforcedthermoplastic resins, such as ABS resins, AES resins i.e. a graft copolymer of acrylonitrile andstyrene on an ethylene propylene rubber or on an ethylene propylene diene rubber or AAS resins i.e. agraft copolymer of acrylonitrile and styrene on an acrylic rubber , in order to improve the performance ofthe product. Moreover, the thermoplastic resin of the invention may be employed in admixture with variousother resins, such as polyphenylene ether resins, polyoxymethylene resins, polyamides or polyesters. Thethermoplastic resin obtained by the process of the invention has particularly good compatibility withpolyphenylene ether resins and a blend composition of the two has excellent heat resistance, impactstrength, surface gloss of moulded articles, solvent resistance and ability to be coated. The thermoplasticresin of the invention will also blend well with polycarbonate resins and the resulting blend has excellentability to be coated. Moreover, the thermoplastic resin of the invention may also be employed in admixture with copolymersof at least one alkenyl aromatic monomer, at least one unsaturated nitrile monomer and optionally at leastone unsaturated ester monomer, for example commercially available AS resins. Where a thermoplastic resin produced by a process of the invention is to be blended with another resinor copolymer, the thermoplastic resin having a high content of rubbery polymer and produced by theprocess of the invention is preferably blended with the other resin or copolymer, in such proportions thatthe content of the rubbery polymer in the final resin composition is within the range of from 5 to 40 byweight, in order to achieve good results. In order to improve the special chemical resistance, processabilityand impact resistance of the final resin composition, it is desirable that the AS resin to be blended has arelatively high content of unsaturated nitrile monomer, for example 30 by weight or more, and an intrinsicviscosity of 0.35 dl g or more, as measured in methyl ethyl ketone at 30 C. It is also possible to incorporate into the thermoplastic resin of the invention or into any compositioncontaining the same a variety of conventional additives in appropriate amounts, in particular agingretardents, such as hindered phenols, or lubricants, such as metal salts of fatty acids. Since the thermoplastic resin of the invention has good special chemical resistance, impact resistanceand processability, it has a high value in industry particularly for use as materials for coating and as interiortrims for refrigerators. The invention is further illustrated by the following Examples, in which parts and percentages are byweight. Butadiene was subjected to emulsion polymerisation using a fatty acid soap as emulsifier, a redoxsystem initiator composed essentially of cumene hydroperoxide and ferrous sulphate, and t dodecylmercaptan as a chain transfer agent. The polymerisation system was forcibly stirred during polymerisation,giving a polybutadiene latex hereinafter referred to as latex A containing enlarged particles. Thepolymerisation time was 60 hours and the conversion was 60 . The average gel content of latex A was78 and the weight fraction of particles having a diameter of 310 nm or more as measured by the sodiumalginate method was 60 . Into a reactor equipped with a stirrer, a heating jacket, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, an inlet fornitrogen gas and means for continuously adding monomer emulsion and polymerisation initiators werecharged the following substances The air in the reactor was then replaced by nitrogen and the resulting mixture was heated andsubjected to graft polymerisation at 70 C for 1 hour. The following mixture was then added continuously to the reactor over a period of 2 hours After the addition was complete, the reaction was continued, with stirring, at 70 C for 1 hour. To theresulting graft polymer latex was then added 1.0 part of 2,6 di t butyl The fluidity in processing was measured by means of a Koka type flow tester nozzle 1 mm diameter x2 mm, load 30 kg cm The Izod impact strength was measured by the method of ASTM D 256 at 23 C on a test piecemoulded by means of a 5 ounce 142 g injection machine at 220 C. The lifting property was measured by the following method on a test piece of dimensions 55 mm x 80mm x 1.6 mm, moulded by means of a 1 ounce 28 g injection machine at 220 C. The test piece wascoated with a urethane coating Ureol No. 600, produced by Kawakami Paint by blowing it was thendipped in gasoline and the time was measured until the urethane coating film was swollen and peeled. Thelonger this time, the better is the lifting property . The test of resistance to fluorocarbon gases was carried out by the following method on a test piece ofdimensions 40 mm x 200 mm x 2 mm, moulded by means of a press moulding machine at 210 C. Thetest piece was fixed on a semicircular strain imparting means having an outer diameter of 130 mm at 23 C,which was placed in a glass desiccator having an internal capacity of 10 litres and containing Freon trademark R 11, a liquid, at the bottom. The desiccator was sealed and then placed in a thermostatic chamberadjusted to 50 C, where it was allowed to stand for 1 hour. The desiccator was then taken out of thethermostatic chamber and allowed to stand at 23 C for 2 hours. Finally, the desiccator was placed in athermostatic chamber adjusted to 30 C, where it was allowed to stand for 120 hours. A dumbbell, asdefined in ASTM D 1822, was longitudinally cut from the test piece treated as described above, by meansof a clicker blade. The tensile impact strength was measured on this dumbbell according to the method ofASTM D 1822. The physical properties tested as described above are reported in Table 1. Polymerisation and compounding were carried out in the same manner as in Example 1, except that theamounts of styrene and acrylonitrile employed in the graft polymerisation were changed to the valuesshown in Table 1. The composition of the graft polymer and the physical properties of the resulting resincomposition are also shown in Table 1. Polymerisation and compounding were carried out in the same manner as in Example 1, except that theamounts of styrene and acrylonitrile in the graft polymerisation were changed to the values shown in Table 1. The compositions of the resulting graft polymers and the physical properties of the resin compositionsprepared from them are also shown in Table 1. In Comparative Example 1, the acrylonitrile content of the monomer mixture employed in the first stepof the process is outside the scope of the present invention. In Comparative Example 2, the amount ofmonomers polymerised in the first step is outside the scope of this invention. In Comparative Examples 3and 4, the acrylonitrile content of the part of the polymer formed by polymerisation is outside the scope ofthis invention. From the results shown in Table 1, it can be seen that, where the acrylonitrile content of the monomermixture in the first step is outside the scope of the invention as in Comparative Example 1 or the amountof monomer mixture charged in the first step is outside the scope of the invention as in ComparativeExample 2 , the lifting property and resistance to fluorocarbon gases are adversely affected. Also, where theacrylonitrile content of the part of the polymer formed by polymerisation in the process of the invention istoo high as in Comparative Example 3 , the fluidity deteriorates, whereas, if it is too low as in ComparativeExample 4 , the coating film is not satisfactory and hence such acrylonitrile contents are not desirable. The air in the reactor was then replaced by nitrogen and the mixture was heated and subjected to graftpolymerisation at 70 C for 1 hour. The following mixture was then continuously added to the mixture in thereactor over a period of 2 hours After the addition was complete, the reaction was continued for a further 1 hour, with stirring, at 70 C.1.0 part of 2,6 di t butyl Polymerisation was carried out in the same manner as described in Example 3, except that the amountsof styrene and acrylonitrile were changed to the values reported in Table 2, so that the acrylonitrile contentof the monomer mixture charged in the first step was 34.6 , which is outside the scope of the presentinvention. The composition of the monomers and the physical properties of the resin obtained are shown inTable 2. The first step of the graft polymerisation reaction was carried out as described in Example 3, butthereafter mixtures A and B were added in that order over a period of 1 hour The reaction was continued for a further 1 hour at 70 C after the addition was complete. The otherprocedures and conditions were as in Example 3. The physical properties of the resin obtained are shownin Table 2. The first step of the graft polymerisation reaction was carried out as described in Example 3, butthereafter, the following mixture was added continuously over a period of 2 hours A mixture of 5 parts of styrene and 0.05 part of cumene hydroperoxide was then added and thereaction was continued for a further 1 hour at 70 C, with stirring. The other procedures and conditions were as described in Example 3. The physical properties of theresin obtained are shown in Table 2. This Example demonstrates that the distribution of styrene andacrylonitrile in the polymerisation reactions of the second and any subsequent steps is not critical, providedthat the acrylonitrile content of the monomer composition is within the scope of the invention. The procedure described in Example 3 was repeated, except that the whole of the styrene employed inExample 3 was replaced by The procedure described in Example 3 was repeated, except that vinyltoluene a mixture of the ortho,meta and para isomers was used in place of the whole of the styrene employed in Example 3. Thephysical properties of the resulting resin are shown in Table 2. The following substances were charged into the same reactor as was employed in Example 1 The air in the reactor was then replaced by nitrogen and the resulting mixture was heated andsubjected to graft polymerisation at 70 C for 1 hour. The following mixture was then continuously addedthereto over a period of 2 hours After completion of the addition, the reaction was continued for a further 1 hour at 70 C, with stirring.The resulting graft polymer latex was then treated in the same manner as described in Example 1, torecover the graft polymer. The acrylonitrile content of the part of the polymer formed by polymerisation inthe process of the invention was 30 . The graft polymer was blended with the same AS resin as was employed in Example 1, in such anamount that the amount of rubbery polymer in the blend was 24 . The physical properties of the blendwere measured and the results obtained are shown in Table 2. A stainless steel reactor was thorougly purged with nitrogen. 53.6 g of cupric bromide and 1 110 g ofdibutylamine were added to the reactor, followed by a solution of 8.75 kg of 2,6 xylenol in 40 litres oftoluene. The resulting mixture was stirred to form a uniform solution, and polymerisation was conducted at30 C for 2 hours, while blowing oxygen at a high rate into the reactor. After termination of thepolymerisation, ethanol was gradually added, whilst vigorously stirring the polymer solution phase, to form aslurry, which was filtered and the product dried to give a polymer hereinafter abbreviated as PPE . The thermoplastic resin obtained as described in Example 1 or 2 or Comparative Example 1 wasblended with an AS resin and with PPE, and the properties of the blend thus obtained were measured,giving the results shown in Table 3. The thermoplastic resin obtained as described in Example 1, an AS resin having an acrylonitrile contentof 32 and a polycarbonate resin FN 2200 produced by Idemitsu Petrochemical Co. Ltd. were mixed inthe proportions shown in Table 4 to give compositions except for Comparative Example 7, where thepolycarbonate resin alone was used the physical properties of the compositions were measured and theresults obtained are shown in Table 4.
