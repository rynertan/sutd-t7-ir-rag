# Ion exchange membrane cell and electrolytic process using thereof.

## Abstract
An ion exchange membrane cell comprises an anode 4 , a cathode 5 an anode compartment and a cathode com partment formed by partitioning by an ion exchange mem brane 1 . A gas and liquid permeable porous non electrode layer 2,3 is bonded at least one of surface of said ion exchange membrane. An ion exchange membrane 1 com prises a gas and liquid permeable porous non electrode layer 2,3 which is bonded to at least one surface of said membrane 1 . An aqueous solution of an alkali metal chlor ide is electrolyzed in an electrolytic cell comprising an anode 4 , a cathode 5 , an anode compartment and a cathode compartment formed by partitioning with an ion exchange membrane 1 wherein a gas and liquid permeable porous nonelectrode layer 2,3 is bonded to at least one of surfaces of said ion exchange membrane 1 and an aqueous solution of an alkali metal chloride is fed into said anode compart ment to form chlorine on said anode and to form an alkali metal hydroxide in said cathode compartment.
