## Description
SEMICONDUCTOR VAPOR PHASE GROWING APPARATUS This invention relates to semiconductor vapor phase growing apparatus. So called vapor phase growing apparatus in which vapor phase growth is performed on a semiconductor wafer has called attention in recent years because semiconductor tips are used in various industrial fields. In the vapor phase growing apparatus now being used, a sequence program hereinafter termed a process program indicative of the progress of the process in a reaction furnace is excecuted by a system in which the progress of the sequence is designated by a pin board switch or the like, and the flow quantity of the gas used and the furnace temperature are designated by setting variable resistors contained in a control device by an operator. Fig. 1 is a block diagram explaining the conventional manner of controlling the progress of the process in a reaction furnace with a pin board switch system. In Fig. 1, pins are inserted into a set panel of a pin board switch according to an order ot execution of a process program PPi i 1 i7 , and the set panel is constructed such that the sequence times of the process program of the respectively designated orders can be set in the units of hours, minutes and seconds. To a relay ladder circuit B are applied instructions corresponding to the order of a sequence, that is instructions that make effective the contents of process programs pp2, pp3, pp4, pp6, pp5 and pp6 corresponding to steps Qi, Q2 Q6, Q7 so as to give control signals to valves or like means corresponding to respective instructed processes.With such pin board system, however , only the times of respective process sequences can be set, but the flow quantity of the gas used and the furnace temperature must be set with other measures, for example variable resistors. In addition to the pin board system shown in Fig.1, a control device utilizing a general purpose sequence controller has also been proposed. In such control device too, the flow quantity and the furnace temperature are not designated by directly programmed data so that such setters as variable resistors are necessary. Furthermore, in the pin board system described above only one group of a series of programs corresponding to one cycle of the reaction furnace, that is only one set of pp2 pp3 ppl pp4 xpp6 pp5 pp7 shown in Fig. 1 can be loaded so that in order to operate a plurality of reaction furnaces a plurality of pin board panel units corresponding thereto should be provided. In this regard, since the general purpose controller contains a timer, only a problem of ti e designation program is involved. Where the general purpose program is used, since its process program is not contructed to designate the gas flow quantity and the furnace temperature, setters of these paras meters have been used. Principal reasons are as follows. 1. Although the system program of a general purpose sequence controller is prepared by its maker, just like the pin board system, the decoding items of the content of the process program according to its.system program lack the items regarding gas flow quantity used and the reaction furnace designation temperature. For this reason, the gas flow quantity and the furnace temperature are set by such independent setters as variable resistors or the like manipulated by the operator. 2. From the standpoint of the operator, manipulation of the general purpose sequence controller, the ability of directly controlling the gas flow quantity and the furnace temperature are equivalent to those of the pin board system so that the operator can operate the reaction furnace without any caution. Especially, correction of set values can be made readily. 3. From the standpoint of the maker, where manual setters for the gas quantity and the furnace temperature are omitted, it is necessary to modify the system program so as to include a program for correct the content of the process program as a portion of the system program. Since the reaction temperature in the furnaces is about 12000C, at start, the furnace temperature is raised to 1200C from room temperature. However, when the temperature is raised rapidly the wafers crack resulting in a so called slip phenomenon.Accordingly, it is necessary to control the output V of a high frequency source of the reaction furnace such that the temperature of the furnaces varies linearly, as shown in Fig. 25. Such control is made with a control unit to be described later such that it merely applies. control.signals for controlling valves of various gases and cooling water, and for supplying and interrupting heating power. In contrast, the flow quantities of the gases and the furnace temperature, the most important factors in actual operation, are set by such setters as variable resistors. In other words, these important factors are not controlled by the control device. For example, an inclination angle 6 Fig. 25 of the source output is set by a setter so as to gradually increase the source output as shotz in Fig. 25 while only the heating time is controlled by the sequence controller. However, the temperature of a support adapted to support wafer rises slowly as shown by a heavy line in Fig. 25 due to the heat capacity of the support, thus failing to follow up the increase in the source output. More particularly, the temperature of the support increases very slowly at the start of the heating and then rises abruptly. Accordingly, the wafers are subjected to this abrupt temperature variation, thus causing slip. These problems have been solved by thickening the support or by gradually increasing the furnace temperature. However, these measures prolong the vapor phase growing time, thus increasing the cost of the products. Another method of solving these problems utilizes a commercial temperature controller. This method can eliminate the defects of the first method in which the inclination angle o is set by a variable resistor. More particularly, as shown in Fig. 26, the heating time required for the support to reach the operating temperature 12000C, is divided into a plurality of sections P1, P2 .... P by taking into consideration n the temperature characteristic of the support, and rates of temperature variations of respective sections are preset so that the output increase rate of the source will become high in time zones in which the rate of temperature rise of the support is low,whereas the output increase rate will be low in time zones in which the rate of temperature rise of the support is high. Although this method enables to linearly control the temperature of the support, it is necessary to set the rate of change at many points and to measure the actual temperature characteristic of the support for setting the temperature change rates. Such troublesome measurement and setting must be made each time the support is exchanged. Where the temperature is repeatedly raised and lowered in one process sequence and where the selected inclination angle 6 differs in respective sequences, it is necessary to provide the temperature controllers of the same number as that of the sequences, thus increasing the cost of the control system. It is a principal object of this invention to provide vapor phase growing apparatus provided with an improved program control device prestoring the contents of all process instructions so as to simplify the setting operation of the operator where a plurality of reaction furnaces are operated alternately. Another object of this invention is to provide vapor phase growing apparatus in which a modifying program that corrects the contents of the process program is included in the system program. Still another object of this invention is to provide vapor phase growing apparatus wherein where a group of process programs corresponding to a one cycle operation of a reaction furnace is prestored in an external memory medium, there is provided an input device combined with the external memory medium to receive therefrom a group of the process programS A further object of this invention is to provide vapor phase growing apparatus wherein where induction heating coils in a plurality of reaction furnaces are connected to a common high frequency source via a transfer switch, the timings of supplying electric powers to respective reaction furnaces are adjusted to efficiently supply high frequency powers to respective reaction furnaces from the high frequency source. Still further object of this invention is to provide vapor phase growing apparatus provided with a system program comprising a program for forming a process program adapted to form a group of process programs corresponding to one cycle of a reaction furnace based on an operating table of the cycle. Another object of this invention is to provide improved semiconductor vapor phase growing apparatus capable of efficiently growing semiconductor layers on semiconductor wafers by uniformly increasing the temperature thereof at a high speed without causing slip of the wafers.

Since dopant gas Dp is supplied from chamber 104 through valves PV23, MFC8, MFC9 and MFCl0, the mixture of the dopant gas Dp, and gases H2 andSiCl4 reached the pipe line PL6A is exhausted through a vent opening. PP 10 is used as EPi DEPO a code meaning epitaxial deposition in which the flow quantities of gases are the same as PP 9 but valve PV19 is opened.Consequently, gases Dp, H2 and SiCl4 are admixed by PVl9 and then supplied to furnace R1 to form P type semiconductors on the wafers 91 supported by the support 75. The growing reaction at this time is a reversible hydrogen reduction reaction as shown by the following equation. SiCl 2H SI 4HC1In this manner, Si is accumulated on respective wafers.Usually, phosphine PH3 is used as the dopant gas Dp. As the dopant gas DN for growing N type semiconductors, is generally used diborane B2H4 . When 3 min.elapses at PP 10 , the vapor phase growth completes and at PP 11 , H2 is passed for 3 min. at a rate of FH 2 min. for purging. PP 12 , PP 13 and PP 14 are not used and PP 15 is used as HEAT OFF to deenergize the Induction heating coil. 3 minutes are selected for decreasing the furnace temperature. During this interval, H2 is supplied at a rate of FH 2 min. At PP 16 , H2 is purged for 3 min Then, at PP 17 ,N2 is passed for 3 min. at a rate of FN 17 min. for effecting N2 purge. In Fig. 9, where dopant gas DN is used for forming layers of N type semiconductors, it can readily be noted from Fig. 7 that DN is supplied from chamber 103 through valves PV5, PV9, MFC4 and MFCS. Where reaction furnace R2 is used instead of R1, valves PVl9 and PV20 are used instead of PV21 and PV22. Fig. 10 is a diagram showing alternate operation of reaction furnaces R1 and R2. The graph shown on the upper side of Fig. 10 shows the relation between the temperature C of the furnace R1 and the progress of respective process programs PP i , while the graph on the lower side shows the progress of respective process programs PP i regarding the furnaceR2. When a start switch S1 of the furnace R1 is closed at time to, the process program group PPG 1 starts and when process programs PP 1 and PP 2 are finished, atPP 3 the induction coil is energized until PP 15 . Immediately upon completion of the PP 15 for furnace R1, supply of the power to the inductIon coil of furnace R2 is commenced. Thusr the switch S2 for starting the furnace R2 is closed after time T4 has elapsed after closure of switch S1. Denoting the interval between the closure of switch S2 and start of the first process program PP 1 of the process program group PPG2 by T3 R2 and the interval between PP 1 and PP 3 by T2 R2 , to effect alternate running the following relation must be satisfied. Tl Rl T4 R2 T3 R2 T2 R2 Since the time of closing switch S2 is arbitrary it is difficult to predetermine the actual starting time or PPG 2 . Usually, switch 52 is closed at time tl when preparation including mounting of the wafers on which semiconductors are to be grown in the furnace is comieted. To realize alternate running shown inFig. 10 without this problem, a system as shown in Fig. il is used. In Fig. 10 time intervals Tl Rl and T2 R2 are known and time data already programmed. In Fig. 11, a register 131 is stored with a difference between intervals Ti and 2. A counter 132 is provided to count the number of counting pulses per second between closures of switches S1 and S2. Another counter 133 is set with the difference T3 between the count T1 T2 of the register 131 and the count T4 of the counter 132 at the time of closing the switch S2, and the count of the counter 133 is decremented by the counting pulse. When the counter 133 counts out, PPG 2 is actually started. Although not shown, according to another method, a counter is provided preset with time T1, and after closure of switch S1, the count is decremented according to a counting pulse. When switch S2 is closed, timeT2 is subtracted, and the difference is further decrement ed according to the timing pulse. When the count of the counter 133 reduces to zero, a start signal is given toPPG 2 . Figs. 12 a and 12 b show the data constructions of a process program PP processed by the system program of this InventIon, and a process program group PPG comprising a group of the process programs PP, respectively. Fig. 12a shows the content of one process program in which the process sequence number I Is stored in the first memory region, and the total data of the succeeding memory regions is stored in the second memory region. As the data, are shown the lasting time of the process sequence in the unit of minutes ana seconds. In the next memory region is stored bit data bit code, and the concrete example the eov will be shown later.The furnace temperature among output data is stored in the next memory region. The next memory region is set with the flow quantity of H2. Where the temperature and H2 are given as the output data, the leftmost bit and a bit spaced therefrom by 2 bits are both 1 . Although Fig. 12a shows an exmaple of one PP i , where there is no temperature designation, and where a plurality of various gases are simultaneously used as the output data, corresponding bits are made to be 1 respectively, whereby the flow quantities of the gases to be sequentially supplied are stored in the memory regions. Fig. 12b shows the data constructions of process program groups PPG 1 and PPG 2 corresponding to the alternate running shown in Fig. 10. Thus, PPG 1 corresponding to the furnace R1 is stored in the first memory region of the left column. Alternate running time Tl and initial alternate time T2 are set in the second and third memory regions.In Fig. 10, for PPG 1 , this initial alternate time T2 is the sum of the sequence times PP l and PP 2 .Following the initial alternate time T2, successive process program data of PP 1 , PP 2 .... PP 17 are stored in the succeeding memory regions. The last memory region stores a code END OF PROGRAM. Fig. 13 is a flow chart showing the processingprocedure of the system program of this invention. At step 1 following te start of the program steps, a flag corresponding to system programs some of them are shown in Fig. 4 designated by a key input such as a set value of switch 67 4 shown in Fig. 5, or an input fro the key input unit 3, for example PROCESS, C, RUN, FETCH , etc. is set in the flag memory region of RAM27. Then at step 2, the flag bit of a process control flag meaning inputting of PROCESS,C is checked.When the result of check is YES, at step 3 the process is controlled, whereas when the result is NO, the program is advanced to step 4 where check is made as to whether various operating switches of furnaces R1 and R2 for example, opening closlng push buttons and motors of the furnaces are ON or not. When the result of check is YES, at step 5 instructions for executing the states of corresponding switches are issued. When the result of step 4 is NO, the program is advanced to step 6, and step 6 through step 25 correspond to respective system programs of from MODIFY TO TEST inROM 27 shown in FIG. 4. Usually, only one of the steps 6 through 25 is selected. Fig. 14 is a detailed flow chart showing the process control corresponding to a subroutine ST3 shown in Fig. 13. At step ST3 1, when the start switch of the reaction furnace R1 is being closed, the program is advanced to step ST3 2 where check.is made as to whether the remaining time of the sequence of the process program PP i now being executed among the process program group PPG 1 related to the furnace R1 is zero or not.As shown by the flow chart of a second system program shown in Fig. 22, the sequence remaining time can be determined by setting the sequence time of one PP i in a register and then by decrementing the content thereof at each second. When the sequence remaining time is zero atstep ST3 2, at the next step ST3 4, the next process program Pup is designated to take in its data. Then, at the step ST3 5, the sequence time of the newly designated sequence time is set. As a consequence, the second system program described above is executed.Then at step ST3 6, the output data, that is data regarding designated gas flow quantities, furnace temperature, etc. are outputted, and at step ST3 7,ON, OFF instructions are issued for various valves. Finally at step STP 8, i is incremented by one for preparing next sequence setting. At step ST3 1, when the start switch of the furnace R1 is OFF, the program is advanced to step ST3 3 where check is made whether the start switch of the furnaceR2 is ON or OFF. When the result of step ST3 3 is YES, at step ST3 9 check is made as to whether the sequence remaining time of the process program now being executed among the process program group PPG 2 regarding the furnace R2 is zero or not. Then, contents of the following steps ST3 10 through ST3 1t correspond to those of the steps ST3 through ST3 8. When the result of step ST3 2 is NO, the program is transferred to step STP 3 through a junction . . Further, when the results of steps ST3 3 and ST3 9 are NO, the program is jumped directly to END, thus completing the processing of the subroutine ST7. Fig. 15 shows a detailed flow chart of the subroutine ST7 shown .in Fig. 13. At the time of modification, when a flag MODIFY is inputted by the key, the system displays on the CRT29 a message of the content MODIFY BELL JAR For furnaces R1 and R2, R1 L, and R2 t R are inputted where R means right and L left. Then as additional informations, process names PPG i KEPI, etc. prepared after modification, date of edition, name of editor, etc. are registered. Then a check is made as to whether what type of process program groups PPG should be modified to prepare the next program pattern, and the result of the check is inputted.Then a process program group PPG which the operator wants to modify is inputted to the control unit 14. The system issues the next message, and informations necessary thereto are registered to modify a process program. A message corresponding to a given PP and a modified state thereof are shown a5 follows SEQUENCE PP 3 N2 50 45 TIME 300 230. This example shows that the flow quantity of N2 is modified from 50 Q min. to 45 Q min., and that the flow time is modified from 3 min. 00 sec. to 2 min.30 sec. Fig. 15 shows the detail of the flow chart of modification processing. At step STP 1, a modified process program Pup is inputted. Then at step ST7 2, a check is made as to whether the inputted PP i belongs to a corresponding PPG or not. When the result of check at step ST7 2 is NO at step STP 3, a check is made whether modification has completed or not, and when the result of check is YES, the subroutine ST7 is termInated. On the other hand, when the result of step ST7 3 is NO, at step ST7 4, an alarm instruction is given to an operator. When the result of step STP 2 is YES, at step ST7 5 time data sequence time are taken out and displayed among the output data. At stepST7 6, a check is made whether it is necessary to modify the time data.When the result of step ST7 6 isYES, the time data are modified as above described at step STP 7. Since this requires alternation of alternative running time, at step ST7 8 the alternate running time is calculated and the calculated time is stored in the memory area for the alternate running time of PPG.Then at step ST7 9, a check is made as to whether there are temperature data or not, and at the step ST7 10, a check is made as to whether it is necessary to modify the temperature data. When the result of check at step ST7 10 is YES, the temperature data are modified at step ST7 ii. At step ST7 12, a check is made as to whether there are flow data of Pup or not, and at step STP 13, acheck is made as to whether it is necessary to modify the gas flow quantity or not. When the result of step ST7 13 is YES, at step ST7 lt the data are modified. Thereafter, necessary modifications are made by sequentially designating necessary process programs PP i in the given PPG. To inform the termination of the modification a flag Sj is inputted. The subroutine ST9 shown in Fig. 13 will now be described. The term PROCESS means a processing performance that forms a process program group to be executed. When PROCESS is inputted, the system produces the following message to be displayed on CRT29 PROCESS BELL JAR Then, a program for furnace Rl or R2 to be used is inputted with the key. L or R or L R is inputted . When these inputs are received by the system satisfactorily no problem would be caused, but when erroneous inputs are applied, the system issues an error message, and the message described above is displayed again to request reinputting. In this manner, correct inputting can be assured like a mutual conversation. Then process names, date of forming the same, and the name of an editor are directly registered as additional informations. Then what type of the process is to be executed is inputted as a process pattern. In the case of aN type vapor phase growth, the following display is inputted. PROCESS PATTERN EPiN I in which the underlined portion is inputted. When various inLormations are inputted in this manner, a program PP to be executed next is prepared. Then, the system issues the following message, and in orma tions necessary therefor are inputted to sequentially form and complete process programs that constitute EPIN. SEQUENCE PP 1 ............. 2 N2 50 TIME 300 where 2 designates the sequence name, 3 and 4 show informations necessary for the sequence. In the case of 3 , N2 is used and the inputted flow quantity is 50 min. In 4 the execution time necessary f or the sequence is inputted. Fig. 16 is a flow chart showing a SRUN. When information RUN is inputted with the keys, the newest information of respective state variations of a process now being executed corresponding to one process program is displayed. When a process is being executed in furnace R1 or R2, the following displays are made, for example. RUN BELL JAR R1 SEQUENCE EPi 1 DEPO SET TIME 123 CURRENT DATA TIME 1200 H2 55 DN 10 SiCl4 22 TIME 59 subtraction RUN BELL JAR R2 SEQUENCE N2 PURGE SET TIME 300 CURRENT DATA N2 55 TIME 59 When one process has been completed, process termination SSS is displayed. The displayed contents described above are executed by the processing steps of the procedure shown in the flow chart shown in Fig.16. Respective steps shown in Fig. 16 will now be described. First, at STll l, a check is rade as to whether the process is now being executed or not. If not, at step ST11 2 a process termination is displayed.When the result of check at step ST11 1 is YES, at step STii 3, the name of the process program PP i that is a sequence now being executed is displayed. Then, at step ST11 4, the sequence time SET TIME of the sequencePP i now being executed is displayed, and at the next step STll 5, a check is made as to whether the sequece is interrupted or not. When the result of the chek isYES, at step STii 7, the interruption time of the sequence PP i being executed is interrogated and displayed.The sequence interruption occurs when the operator commands sequence interruption due to some sort of abnormals occurring during the automatic running, and during normal automatic running sequence interruption would never occur. When the result of step STll 5 isNO, at step ST11 6, the elapsed time of the sequence being executed is displayed. Then, at STll 8, a check is made as to whether the sequence being executed is supervising the temperature or not. When the result of check at step STll 8 is YES, at STll 9, the presently measured furnace temperature is displayed. When the result of step ST11 8 is NO, at step ST11 10, a check is made as to whether the sequencePP i being executed is supervising the gas flow quantity or not. When the result of step STll 10 is YES, at stepST11 11, the present flow quantity is displayed On the contrary, when the result of step ST11 10 is NO, the program is returned to the junction Q. The system program STEP shown in Fig. 4 will now be described. This system program STEP is prepared for charging the order of respective process programs Pup in a given process program group PPG i and when STEP is inputted with the key it is displayed as follow STEP BELL JAR R1 in which underlined portion shows the furnace R1 and inputted by the operator with the key. Then1 the detail of the process program group, date of edition and the name of editor are registered as necessary directory items. Then the system interrogates that orders of what type of PPG should be changed. This display is as follows PROCESS PATTERN EPIN in which the underlined portion is the input by the operator and shows a N type vapor phase growth. As shown in the following, since respective process programs PP i in EPiN one process program group are sequentially shown b the system, informations necessary there for are inputted to the right side of the equations with the key. SEQUENCE PP 1 SEQUENCE PP 2 SEQUENCE PP 3 EMI38.1 tb SEQUENCE SEP SEP Pup 4 tb SEP f tb SEQUENCE SEP SEP PP 17 tb In order to terminate the STEP, is inputted. Fig. 17 is a flow chart showing the detail of the subroutine ST13 shown in Fig. 13. More particular ly, as STEP is inputted, at step ST13 1 a memory region for the STEP is ensured. Then at step ST13 2, a sequence number i is inputted. Thereafter, at stepST13 3, a check is made whether sequence number is i or not. When the result of check at step ST13 3 is YES, the data regarding PP i are transferred to the ensured memory region. If the result of step STP13 5 was NO, at stepSTP13 5, a check is made whether the STEP has ended or not. When the result is YES, the program is terminated, whereas when the result is NO, at step ST13 6, an alarm is displayed for the operator on the assumption that there is a sequence number actually present, thus terminating the STEP processing. STORE in ROM27 shown in Fig. 4 will now be described. The purpose of the system program STORE is to transfer a processed or modified process program groupPPG to such external memory medium as a cassette magnetic tape, minifloppy disc, and bubble memory device. Fig. 18 is a flow chart showing the detail of the subroutine ST15 shown in Fig. 13. At step ST15 1, the head process program PP i , i 1 of a program group PPG K to be stored in the external memory medium is set, and then at step ST15 2 the external recording medium CMT5l to be used is initialized to check whether the memory medium can be used or not.After that, at step ST15 3 a judgement is made as to whether all PP i have been transferred from RAM26 toRAM53 or not. When the result of judgement is YES, it means that all data regarding one PPG K have been transferred from ROM26 to ROM53. Then, at step ST15 4, transfer of data from RAM53 to CMT5l is executed according to the program stored in ROM52. Upon completion of the transfer to CMTS1 at step ST15 5, termination is informed to the operator. On the other hand, when the result of step ST15 3 is NO, at step ST15 6, the data of PP i are transferred to RAM53. Then at step ST15 7, a check is made as to whether there is an abnormal or not, and when the result is YES, at step ST15 9, generation of abnormal is informed to the operator. If the result of step ST15 7 is NO, at step ST15 8 i is incremented by one so as to designate the next sequence PP i 1 . Upon completion of the stepST15 8, the program is returned back to step ST15 3 to repeat the steps following thereto. As can be noted frcm the block diagram shown in Fig. , according to the process of STORE, PPG i stored in RAM26 is transferred to RAM53 through i o bus line 23, high speed data transfer unit HMT 45, data highway 47, HMT50 and data bus line 48.The PPG K stored in RAM53 is stored in an external recording medium, e.g. the cassette magnetic tape 51 CMT via bus line 48, SUB CPU 6, bus line 54 and cassette magnetic tape interface 49. The system program SORT shown in Fig. 4 will now be described. This program SOFT functions oppositely to the program STORE. That is the PPG K stored inCMT51 is transferred to RAM26 via RAM53. A detailed flow chart of the subroutine ST17,Fig. 13, corresponding to process SORT is shown in Fig. 19. Thus, at step ST17 1, an external memory medium not storing any process program group PPG K but to be stored later therewith is designated. Then at stepST17 2, a check is made as to whether PPG K is actual ly stored in the designated external memory mediumCMT51 or nct. When the result of check is NO, at step ST17 3 this fact is informed to the operator. When the result of step STi7 2 is YES, at step ST17 4 data regarding a PPG K are transferred from CMT51 to RAM53. through ROM52 and CPU46 After that, at step STP17 5, a check is made whether the transfer of the data from CMT51 to RAM53 has been completed or not. When the result is NO, the program is returned to step ST17 4. On the other hand, Then the result is YES, at step STP 6 data of respectivePP i are transferred to RAM26 acting as the main memory device. Then at step ST17 7, a check is made whether there is an abnormal or not, and if there is an abnormal it is informed to the operator at step ST17 8. If there is no abnormal, at step ST17 7, i is incremented by one to prepare a next sequence PP i l . Then, at step STP17 10, a check is made whether transfer of data from RAM53 to RAM26 has completed or not. When the result is YES, it means that processing of SORT has been completed and is displayed. When the result of step ST17 10 is NO, the program is returned to step ST17 6 and the loop is executed again. The VERIFY system program shown in Fig. t will now be described. This system program is utilized to display on the CRT29 a process program group stored inRAM26 for the purpose of being verified by the operator When VERIFY is inputted, a message VERIFY NAD4E is issued so as to output the content of the process program group PPO K by inputting the process name to the underlined portion. One example of the display output is as follows PROCESS NkdE N N2 PURGE TIME 1234FLOW OF N2 55EMI42.1 tb H2 SEP PURGE tb N2 SEP PURGE tb FLOW OF N2 55In this manner, displayings are sequentially executed and when the content of the last N2 PURGE is outputted the program is terminated. Fig. 20 shows a detailed flow chart of the subroutine STl9 shown in Fig. 13. Thus, at step STl9 1, a head process program PP i of the given PPG K is set. Then at step ST19 2, the sequence number of the set PPti is checked. If the result of check is NO, at step ST19 3 the termination of the VERIFY PROGRME is checked. If not terminated, at step STl9 4 it is displayed to the operator on the assumption that not present sequence number has appeared. When the result of step STl9 2 is YES, the time data sequence time in the data of PP i is transferred to CRT RAM 25. Then at step ST19 6, the time data is displayed on CRT 29. After that, at ST19 7 a check is made whether there are temperature data in the PP i data, and when there are temperature data, at stepST19 8, the temperature data are displayed on CRT29.Then at step STl9 9, a check is made whether there are flow quantity data regarding used gas in the data of PP i , and if there are the data, the flow quantity data are displayed on CRT29 at step ST19 10. Then at step STl9 11 i is incremented by one for preparing the next sequence PP i l . Thereafter, the program is returned to the junction 1 to repeat steps ST19 2 through STl9 11. The system program DIAGNOSIS shown in Fig. 4 will now be described. Thus, when a DIAGNOSIS is inputted with the key, whether there is an abnormal of the process at the present time or not is checked. An example of a fault message is as follows. DIAGNOSIS FLOW ERROREMI43.1 tb A0 SEP Al tb N2 SEP SEP SEP tb in which A0 shows a specific flow quantity controller,Al a set flow quantity and A2 an actual flow quantity during the abnormal. Fig. 21 1 is a detailed flow chart of the subroutine ST21 shown in Fig. 13. At atep ST21 1 a check is made whether there is an error registration or not. This check is made by checking an error code registration region Fig. 21 3 of RERs 25 and 55 by executing the self diagnosis program shown in Fig.21 2 .When the result of step ST21 1 is YES, at step ST21 2, the number K Fig. 21 3 of the registered error is taken out. Then, at step ST21 3, error codes are taken out and at step ST21 , taken out error codes are connected into fault messages which are displayed on CRT. Then, at step ST21 5, the number of registered errors is subtracted with 1 and at step ST21 6, a check is made whether there is an error registration number number of not displayed errors or not. If the number is not zero the program is returned to stepST21 3. If zero, the system program terminates. Fig. 21 2 shows the flow chart showing aforementioned self diagnosis routine, in which at stepST21 10, a check is made as to whether there is an abnormal or not. The checked items includes temperature, flow quantity voltages supplied to various valves, etc. When the result of step ST21 IO is YES, at step ST2l ll instructions necessary to remove abnormal conditions of furnaces R1 and R2 and their peripheral apparatus are given. Such removal can be made, for example, by temporarily stopping the progress of the sequence. Then at step ST21 21, an alarm is displayed to give an alarm to the operator and at step ST21 13, error codes are registered or stored in corresponding regions of Ray25. The system program of USED TIME shown in Fig. d will be described as follows. USED TIME represents the time spent by reaction furnaces Rl and R2 until present time. When USED TIME is inputted by the keyEMI45.1 tb SEP DAYS SEP HOURS SEP MIN. SEP SEC. SEP tb LEFT SEP USE SEP TIME SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tb RIGHT SEP USE SEP TIME SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tb are displayed on CRT29. In this example, LEFT shows furnace R1, and RIGHT furnace R2. Fig. 22 shows a flow chart of a second processing program in the system program stored in ROM24, and the content of the USED TIME described above are given as a result of execution of the subroutines ST2 and ST4. In Fig. 22, when the execution of the second processing program is instructed, at step ST1S S means second , the start switch of the reaction furnace R1 is turned ON. Then at step ST2S, the sequence time of the program is decremented. When the result of stepST1S is NO or when the processing at step ST2S has been completed, at step ST3S a check is made whether the start switch of R2 has been turned ON or not. If ON, the decrement of the sequence time of R2 is done in the same manner as in R2. This second process program is inserted at each second into the main system program of ROM24. The TEST system program shown in Fig. 4 is as follows. The TEST performance is utilized for the maintenance of the control device of this invention. TEST PERFORMANCE is divided Fto 6 items and constructed such that each performance can be called like a conversation for execution. Respective performances are as follows. EV EV performance For the purpose of operating process control valves Electromagnetic Valves , the operator operates keys of E, V and CR after CRT29 has displayed NAME . Then CRT29 displays OPEN Y, N . So the operator operates keys of Y and CR where Y means YES and CR means Carriage Return. In a case of setting the valves to be closed, CRT29 displays as follows and the operator inputs each key shown with a underline. NAME 0E, V CR OPEN Y, N N CR or CR NO valve member CR The setting operations terminate when key of E is inputted as follows. NO E CR CRT29 displays NAME .Aforementioned key operations by the operator are shown as the following underlined portions. NAME G OPEN Y, N Y CRThen, CRT29 displays and requests the operator to input the valve number NO valve number CR The setting operations for opening the electromagnetic valves are terminated by inputting keys E and CR after CRT29 has displayed NO . Valves whose numbers have been designated remain in the closed or opened states. Actual examples are as follows S T E CR T, E mean tests NAME QE G EMI47.1 tb SEP NO 00R SEP tb SEP NO SEP SEP 1 SEP O SEP CR SEP EV5 SEP and SEP 10 SEP close tb SEP NO SEP SEP E SEP CR tb NAME SEP SEP i SEP CR SEP tb SEP OPEN SEP Y, SEP N SEP SEP Y SEP CR SEP tb SEP NO SEP SEP 7 SEP CR tb SEP EV7 SEP close tb SEP NO SEP SEP E SEP CR tb NAME other performances are called.2 MF performance The purpose of this performance is to operate a mass flow paper riser controller for process control. According to NAME INPUT Y, N an interrogation is made whether an input operation is desired or an output operation displaying is desired. At the time of inputting operation, Q and GC are inputted. NO mass flow valve number DATA where represents data value NO By sequentially designating mass flow valve numbers, data at the time of inputting are displayed for only one minute. At the end of display, CRT29 displays NO E In a case of outputting operation QCR or CR are inputted. NO mass fiow valve number DATA flow quantity OR NO By sequentially designating mass flow valve numbers, flow quantities can be set. Termination is designated by E CR. Example TEST NAME M F CR INPUT Y, N N CR or CR NO S CR DATA 1 S CR 15 is designated, MFC5 NO S CR DATA 3 O O CR 300 cc is designated, MFC8 NO E CR NAME M F CR INPUT Y, N 0GC NO 5 CR DATA process for one minute MFC5 NO 8 CR DATA process for one minute MFC8 NO E CR NAME G CRT performance All characters generated by a character generator is supplied.

NAME S C CR ON Y, N Thus, an interrogation is made as to whether valves are to be opened or closed. At the time of opening, Y CR are inputted whereas at the time of closing N, CR or CR are inputted. Then, according to NO valve number CR designated valves are ON OFF controlled. P ATC Automatic Temperature Control this performance is used or a temperature rise test, a uniform heating test, etc. NAME A T CR BELL JAR Which one of the bell jars furnaces R1, R2 is used is interrogated. When characters other than R and are inputted, it is judged that these characters are used for R2. Then, the gas system is transferred to aN2 purge line to seal the bell jar. When sealed, an exhaust valve is opened. At this time, evacuation is not made because the bell jar is being evacuated. Thus, the system enables execution of the processes for a selected bell jar. However, when an abnormal condition is found, the ATC control is cancelled. Fig. 23 is a detailed flow chart for calculating the waiting time at the time of alternate running shown in Fig. 10 and corresponds to one of the system programs stored in ROM24 shown in Fig. 4. More particularly, at step ST1S, a check is made as to whether the start switch of the reaction furnace R1 is ON or not. When the result is NO, the program is jumped to step ST7S, whereas when the result is YES, at stepST2S, a check is made as to whether the process of the other furnace R2 is under execution or not. When the result is YES, at step ST3S, the waiting time of furnace R1 is calculated. en the result of step ST2S is NO, in other words, the start switch of R2 has not yet been closed, at step ST4S, a check is made again as to whether the process of R1 is under execution or not, and when the result is YES, the program is jumped to step ST7S.When the result of step ST4S is NO, at step ST5S, a process control flag is set for executing the process of R1. Then at step ST6S, the sequence time of PP i , that is the first process program PP i of the process group PPG to be executed for R1 is made to zero.After that, contents of steps STIS through ST12S correspond as follows ST1S ST7s, ST2S ST8S, ST3S ST9S, ST4S ST10S, ST5S ST11S, ST6S ST12S for respective furnaces R1 and R2. In the foregoing description, reaction furnaces R1 and R2 were in the form of induction heating coils, and the furnaces were alternately operated far efficiently utilizing the source of heating power However, heating can also be made with lamps as shown in Fig. 24. In Flg. 24, 201 designates a source of various gases supplied to a reaction furnace 207 and the gases are admitted Into the furnace 207 through a conduit as shown by arrows. A frusto conical shaped support 209 Is supported from above to be rotatable. Substrates or wafers on which semiconductors are to be grown in vapor phase are mounted on the peripheral surface of the support.Temperature sensors 210 are secure to the rotary shaft of the support 209 and signals from the temperature sensors 210 are applied to a temperature controller 204 over a conductor 203. The temperature controller 204 supplies a control signal to a power converter 205 which supplies electric power to incandescent lamps 206 disposed on the outer periphery of the furnace 207. Accordingly, light emitted by the lamps 206 reaches the wafers 208 through an outer wall or casing made of quartz or the like. With this lamp heating type, since the wafers 208 are heated by the lamps 206 through the outer wall so that power consumption is smaller than the Induction coil heating. When a plurality of lamp heated furnaces are connected in parallel with the source of gases, each furnace can operate independently of the processing executed in the other furnaces. As above described, the vapor phase growing apparatus of this invention can obviate various problems of the prior art pin board type. Especially for the automatic operation, the gas flow quantity data and the temperature instruction data among output instruction data can be beforehand included in the process program so that the operator is not required to issue any construction instruction for the vapor phase growth reaction. The principal feature of a modification of this invention is to raise the furnace temperature to about 12000C most suitable for the vapor phase growth in a minimum interval, while preventing slip of the wafers especially liable to occur at the time of quick temperature rise. To this end, according to this modification the control program is prepared in the following manner and executed by the CPU to control the furnace temperature. More particularly, according to this modification, by taking into consideration the fact that the slip occurs at about 10000C, it is advantagecus to control the temperature in a range of from 8000C to 1200eC and to make short one ramp interval as far as possible.Accordingly, the temperature reference is changed slightly during the sequence time so as to linearly rise the furnace temperature. Fig. 28 shows a flow chart inputting a ramp temperature raising and lowering showing only two examples of temperature raising and lowering of sequence numbers PPNO4 and PPNOl5. Designations of the temperature slope and ramping time are sufficient for effecting highly accurate ramping. For a sequence in which the ramping is effected, it is necessary to determine whether the ramping is to be made or not, and when the ramping is to be made it is necessary to preset its contents. The chart shown in Fig. 28 is used for such procedures. More particularly, as the execution of the program of the control unit is commenced the routine for ramp control information input routine is started to execute step 1. In this example, it is supposed that the sequences for raising and lowering the temperature are PPNO4 and PPNO12 Then, at step 1, a check is made whether the procedure is ramp up temperature rise or not in the sequence Pus04. This procedure is done by supplying a message to the CRT. According to the processing content, ramp up is not made, so that in the case of ramp up an information for it is inputted with the keyboard KB, and the information is inputted to the CPU for executing step 1. When the result of this step isYES, at step 2 a ramp control flag for the PPNO4 sequence is set.Since step 3 is a routine for displaying the preregistered temperature rise time of the sequencePPNO4, the CPU executes this routine to read out the ramping time or the temperature rise control time for one sequence and gives the read out time to the CRT to display its content. At step 4, check is made as to whether it is necessary to correct or not. If correction is necessary, a message is sent to the CRT to know the extent of correction. Depending upon whether correction is necessary or not, a signal YES or NO is inputted from the keyboard and the CPU judges that whether the signal isYES or NO at step 4. When the result of this step isYES, at step 5 a new extent of temperature rise control time inputted from the keyboard KB is registered in RAM and the program is transferred to step 6.When no correction is necessary the program is jumped from step 4 to step 6. At step 6, the extent of temperature rise in one ramping time is displayed on the CRT. Then, at step 7, a check is made as to whether it is necessary to correct the temperature rise to what extent or not. The result of check at step 7 is displayed on the CRT by the CPU and necessary extent of correction is inputted by the keyboard KB. When the result of step 7 is YES, at step 8, the newly inputted extent of temperature rise is stored inRAM. When the result of step 7 is NO, the program is jumped to step 10. When the result of step 1 is NO, at step 9, the ramp control flag of the sequence PPNO4 is cleared and then the program is transferred to step 10. However, when the ramp control flag has been cleared the RAMP control is omitted. At step 10, a judgement is made as to whether the RAMP down temperature lowering is necessary in sequence PPNO15 or not. The result of judgement is also displayed on the CRT and keyboard KB is operated to satisfy the result of judgement. When the result of judgement at step 10 is NO, at step 11, the ramp control flag of the sequence PPNO1S is cleared so as to register that the RAMP control is unnecessary, thereby terminating the routine regarding the ramp control information. When the result of judgement of step 10 is YES, a ramp control flag for the sequence PPNO15 is set.Then at step 13, stored one ramp time, that is the temperature lowering extent control time for sequence PPNOi5 is read out and displayed on the CRT. Then at step 15, a check is made as to whether it is necessary to correct the control time by what extent and the result is also displayed on the CRT. The operator operates the keyboard to perform the required correction. When the result of step 14 is YES, at step 15, the newly inputted temperature lowering extent control time is stored in RAM and the program is advanced to step 16. When the result of step 14 15 NO, at step 16 the extent of temperature lowering for one ramping time which is stored at sequence PPNOl5 is read out and displayed on the CRT. Then at step 17, a check is made as to whether it is necessary to correct the extent of temperature lowering to determine the amount of correction. This amount is also displayed on the CRT and inputted with the keyboard KB. When the result of step 17 is NO, the program is jumped to step 19, whereas when the result is YES, at step 18, the inputted value is stored as a new extent of temperature lowering. At setp 19, the final value of the lowered temperature of the sequence PPNOl5 is read out and displayed on the CRT. Then at step 20 a judgement is made as to whether it is necessary to correct the final value of the lowered temperature and the result of the check is displayed on the CRT and corrected with the keyboard KB. When the result of step 20 isNO, the ramp control information inputting procedure is terminated. When the result of step 20 is YES, at step 21, the newly inputted finally lowered temperature is stored, thus terminating the ramp control information input procedure. When the above described routine has been executeed, informations regarding execution of the ramping or not, the temperature gradient, and the ramping time of the sequences PPNO4 and PPNOi5 are stored. Upon completion of the ramp control information routine, the main program having the content as shown in Fig. 9 is executed. When the program enters into the sequence of PPNO4 the ramp control routine as shown in Fig. 29 is, commenced to effect the ramp control. More particularly, in the ramp control routine, step 22 is executed to check whether the sequence is a temperature raising sequence or not. Since the main program contains a temperature raise sequence when the present sequence is PPNO4, whereas a temperature lowering sequence in the case of the sequence PPNOl5, in the case of the temperature raising sequence, the program is transferred to step 23 from step 22, whereas in the case of the temperature lowering sequence the program is transferred to step 36. Since at step 2 or 9, a flag regarding ramping or not is set, at step 23 a check is made whether ramp control is to be made or not in accordance with the content of the flag. When the result of step 23 isYES, at step 24 a judgement is made whether the ramping is to be started cr the ramping is now being executed.When the ramping is to be started, at step 26 the output of the temperature sensor TS is read through linearizer and an A D converter to form the present temperature information of the wafers being heated, which is written in a portion indicating the previous output control quantity. At step 27, the remaining time of the sequence PPNO4 measured at the time of commencing the ramp control routine is compared with one ramping time assigned to sequence PPNO4. When the remaining time is large the program is advanced to step 28 whereas in the opposite case the step is transferred to step 25 because the remaining time is too small. At step 25, a target temperature set for sequencePPNO4 is outputted. When the result of step 23 is NO, the step 25 is also executed. The outputted target temperature is applied to a digital display and adjuster through a D A converter to control the furnace temperature to the target value. At step 28, where the ramping is possible for a predetermined time in the remaining sequence time, the extent of temperature rise preset in one ramping time is added to the previous output control quantity to determine the extent of temperature rise, that is the target temperature in the present ramping time. Then at step 29 controlled extent of the temperature rise is compared with the target temperature of the sequence PPNO4. When the former is smaller than the latter the program is advanced to step 30 whereas in the opposite case, at step 25 the furnace temperature is maintained at the target temperature. At step 30 the controlled extent of temperature rise is outputted which is given to the digital display adjuster so as to control the high frequency generator such that the furnace temperature becomes the target temperature.Then at step 31, a temperature rise control time, that is one ramping time, for example, 3 or 6 seconds, is set. The one ramping time thus set is registered in a second processing program for supervizing each ramping time. The detail of the second processing program is shown in Fig. 30 in which at step 32, a judgement is made whether the temperature rise control time is zero or not. When the result of judgement is NO, at step 34 the temperature rise time is decremented and at step 33 the second processing routine for lowering the temperature is executed. The content of this routine is substantially the same as those of steps .32 and 34. Thus at step 33 a judgement is made whether the registered temperature lowering control time, that is one ramping time is zero or not, and when the result is NO, at step 35 the temperature lowering control time is decrementd. These processings are performed at a spacing of one second and when the temperature rise control time becomes zero, the ramp control routine is executed.In the same manner, when the temperature lowering control time becomes zero, the ramp control routine is executed. In the second processing program supervisions of the times of temperature raising and lowering are performed independently because two reaction furnaces are controlled alternately. Where a single furnace is used, duplicate routines may be combined into a single routine. In the second processing program, when one ramping time elapses, the ramp control routine is started again to repeat the procedures described. Then, the result of step 24 becomes NO so that the step 26 is omitted, and at step 28 the previous extent of temperature rise is calculated as the previous output control quantity. Because, since the furnace temperature at the time of starting the ramping has been set at the initial stage the temperature at the starting point has determined so that the desired temperature control can be realized by giving the extent of temperature rise at each ramping. It is also possible to store actual temperatures at respective rampings. As above described, as the temperature rise control proceeds so that the remaining time of the sequence reduces, or when the temperature exceeds the target value, at step 25 the target temperature is given to the digital display adjuster so as to control the high frequency generator such that the furnace temperature will reach the target value. When at step 25, the difference between the target temperature and the actual furnace temperature is large enough to cause a slip of the wafers. This means that the extent of temperature rise or the temperature settings in the preceding sequences are not adequate, whereby temperature should be carefully set. At the sequence PPNOi5 in which the main program comprises temperature lowering sequences, the ramp control routine is executed again. At step 22, when it is judged that the sequence is not the temperature raising sequence, at step 36 a judgement is made whether the sequence is a temperature lowering sequence or not. If the result of judgement is NO the program is returned to the main program, whereas when the result is YES, at step 37 a judgement is made whether it is necessary to effect ramp control or not. This step is executed by observing a flag set at steps 11 and 12. If the result of step 38 is NO, at step 43 the high frequency generator is stopped to terminate heating. When the result of step 37 is YES, at step 38 the remaining time of the sequence PPNOl5 independently supervized is compared with a preset one ramping time so as to judge whether the ramping completes or not in the remaining sequences. When the result is NO, the program is jumped to step 43 whereas when the result isYES, at step 39 the temperature of the wafers measured by the temperature sensor TS is stored as the previous output control quantity. More particularly, so long as the temperature raising or lowering control is not effected the furnace temperature is controlled to a value corresponding to the output control quantity which has been the temperature control reference up to the previous sequence so that the detected temperature can be used as the previous output quantity.The preset extent of temperature lowering in one ramping time is subtracted from the previous output control quantity and the difference is used as the extent of temperature lowering, that is a temperature control reference. Then at step 40, the finally lowered temperature, that is a preset final target temperature is compared with the lowered temperature. When the lowered temperature is higher than the target temperature, at step 41 the extent of temperature lowering control is outputted which is given to the digital display adjuster via aD A converter, whereby the output of the high frequency generator is controlled to bring the furnace temperature to the controlled lowered temperature. Then at step 42, the preset one ramping time or the temperature lowering control time for example 6 seconds is stored. After that the second processing program is executed. When the stored time expires, the ramp control routine is executed again to lower temperature. Thus in each stored time, ramping is executed until a newly lowered temperature is reached. As the remaining sequence time becomes less than one ramping time or when the extent of temperature lowering becomes smaller than the temperature at the end point of temperature lowering the temperature lowering sequence is terminated at step 43. After that the program is returned to the main program to execute the next sequence. As above described, in a sequence requiring ramping, the rasping control is repeated with a unit ramping time set shorter than an execution time assigned to the sequence and at a rate preset to be adequate to reach the final target value to reach the target temperature within the execution time of the sequence, so that it is possible to finely ramp with a small time unit. According to this ramping controlZthe furnace temperature can be increased linearly with a desired angle of inclination without accompanying the problem of slip of the wafers. Moreover, the temperature control is made with a program, the temperature control can be made accurately and readily. In other words, according to this invention, even in a temperature range in which the slip tends to occur, rapid temperature change does not occur with the result that the wafers are not subjected to severe heat shock and that the temperature gradient can be made to be a maximum, thus improving the productivity.
