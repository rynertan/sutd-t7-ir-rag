# Heating Diesel fuel.

## Abstract
Conductive polymer compositions based on polyviny lidene fluoride have improved properties when the polyviny lidene fluoride has a very regular structure characterized by a low head to head content in the repeating units. The im proved properties include improved electrical stability when contacted by organic fluids and or when maintained at elevated temperatures in air. Such compositions are particu larly useful in the form of self limiting heaters, e.g. for heating diesel fuel.

The disclosure of each of the patents, publications and applications referred to above is incorporated herein by reference. Electrical devices containing conductive polymers generally though not invariably comprise an outer jacket, usually of insulating material, to protect the conductive polymer from damage by the surrounding environment. However, if no protective jacket is used, or if the jacket is permeable to harmful species in the environment, or if the conditions of use are such that the jacket may become damaged, it is necessary or desirable to select a conductive polymer which is not damaged or which deteriorates at an acceptably low rate when exposed to the surrounding environment.Exposure of conductive polymers to organic fluids generally results in an increase in resistivity exposure to air, especially at elevated temperatures between room teFperatur,e and 35 C below the melting point generally results in a decrease in resistivity both at the elevated temperature and at room temperature a phenomenon known in the art as resistance relaxation . We have discovered that conductive polymer compositions which are based on polyvinylidene fluoride exhibit substantially improved stability if the polyvinylidene fluoride has a very regular structure which can be characterized by a low head to head content in the repeating units. Polyvinylidene fluoride is made up of repeating units of formula CE2CF2 , which can be arranged head to tail i.e. CH2CF2 CH2CF2 or head to head i.e. CE2CF2 CF2CH2 , and we have found that the lower the head to head content, the greater the stability of the resistivity of the composition when exposed to organic fluids and or when exposed to air at elevated temperature.Previously known conductive polymer compositions based on polyvinylidene fluoride have made use of polyvinylidene fluoride of relatively high head to head content, namely at least 5.2 and generally higher, which are easier to process than the polymers used in the present invention. In its first aspect, the present invention provides a conductive polymer composition which comprises a polyvinylidene fluoride having a head to head content of less than 5.0 , preferably less than 4.5 , particularly less than 4.0 , and b a particulate conductive filler, especially carbon black, dispersed in the polyvinylidene fluoride. The composition preferably exhibits PTC behavior. In its second aspect, the invention provides an electrical device which comprises a conductive polymer element composed of a conductive polymer composition as defined above and at least one electrode in electrical contact with said element, for example, at least two electrodes which can be connected to a source of electrical power and which when so connected cause current to flow through the conductive polymer element. Preferred devices are self limiting heaters, e.g. flexible strip heaters, in which the conductive polymer composition exhibits PTC behavior. Such heaters are particularly useful for heating liquids in which the heater is immersed, especially diesel fuel see U.K. applications Nos. 8216999 and 8216997. In a third aspect, the invention provides a method of heating a liquid, particularly an organic liquid, especially diesel fuel, which comprises passing current through a self limiting heater as defined above which is immersed in the liquid. In a fourth aspect the invention provides a fuel feedthrough and heating assembly which can be positioned and connected between a fuel filter and a fuel tank of a fuel supply system to provide means for heating fuel which is being pumped through a fuel line from the fuel tank to the fuel filter, said feedthrough and heating assembly comprising A a feedthrough comprising i a fuel conduit having at one end thereof a fuel line connector for connecting the feedthrough to a fuel line and at the other end thereof a fuel filter connector for connecting the feedthrough to a fuel filter and ii a neck portion which protrudes from the fuel conduit between the ends thereof and which comprises a chamber B a flexible self limiting strip heater as de fined above which preferably comprises a fuel resistant insulating jacket, one end of the strip heater being within the chamber of the neck portion, and the strip heater passing through the fuel line connector and protruding from the fuel conduit C insulated electrical leads connected to the electrodes of the heater, the connections lying within the chamber of the neck portion D a fuel resistant, water resistant and insulat ing composition which encapsulates i the connections between the electrodes and the leads, ii the insulation at the ends of the connected electrical leads and iii the insulating jacket at the end of the connected heater and E a fuel resistant gasket which prevents fuel which is being pumped through the fuel conduit from exiting through the neck portion. Polyvinylidene fluorides suitable for use in this invention are commercially available. The head to head content of a polyvinylidene fluoride can be measured by those skilled in the art. We have found that the measured head to head contents of different samples of a polymer sold under à particular trade name can differ substantially. In general, the presently available polyvinylidene fluorides made by suspension polymerization rather than emulsion polymerization have lower head to head contents.The number average molecular weight of the polymer is generally at least 5,000, eg. 7,000 to 15,000. The polyvinylidene fluoride is preferably a homopolymer of vinylidene fluoride, but the presence of small quantities of comonomers, preferably less than 15 , particularly less than 5 by weight , eg. tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and ethylene, is not excluded. The polyvinylidene fluoride is preferably the sole crystalline polymer in the composition, but other crystalline polymers, eg. other crystalline fluoropolymers, may also be present. The compdsition may contain relatively small amounts preferably less than 35 , especially less than 20 , particularly less than 10 , by volume of one or more elastomeric polymers, particularly solvent resistant fluorine containing elastomers and acrylic elastomers, which are usually added primarily to improve the flexibility and elongation of the composition. The particulate conductive filler preferably comprises carbon black, and often consists essentially of carbon black. Choice of the carbon black will influence the resistivity temperature characteristics of the composition.Compositions exhibiting PTC behavior are preferred for many devices of the ,inve,ntion, especially self limiting heaters, and for these a carbon black having a ratio of surface area m2 g to partic le size mu of 0.03 to 6.0 is preferred.For other uses, compositions exhibiting ZTC or NTC behavior may be preferred. The amount of conductive filler used will depend upon the desired resistivity of the composition. For flexible strip heaters which are to be used for heating diesel fuel and powered by a 12 volt battery, we prefer aPTC composition whose resistivity at 25 C is less than 200 ohm.cm eg. about 10 to about 100 ohm.cm. In such compositions the amount af carbon black may for example be 16 to 25 by weight. In addition to one or more conductive fillers, the compositions may also comprise other conventional additives, such as non conducive fillers including flame retardants , antioxidants and crosslinking agents or residues thereof if the composition has been cross linked . The compositions of the invention are preferably cross linked particularly by irradiation , since this has been found to enhance their resistance to organic solvents. Preparation of the compositions of the invention can be carried out in conventional fashion. Often it will be convenient to melt extrude the composition directly into a water bath which may be heated , and using this technique subsequent annealing is often not required. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples, in which Examples 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 13 areComparative Examples not in accordance with the invention.
