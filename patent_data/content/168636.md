# METHOD FOR MAKING MULTILAYER COATING

## Abstract
A method for making multilayer coating on a support, which comprises simultaneously applying multiple layers of at least two nonaqueous coating liquids on the support, at least one of the liquids containing an electron radiation curable compound, irradiating the applied layers with elec tron rays at a rate of 50 Mrad sec. or less to cure them or to increase the viscosity thereof, and then drying. This meth od can be applied to the production of presensitized plates, multilayer photographic materials, multilayer analytical ele ments, etc.
