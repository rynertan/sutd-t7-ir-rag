The substituted pyridines of the present invention include all the optical isomer forms, that is mixtures of enantiomers e.g. racemates as well as the individual enantiomers. These individual enantiomers are commonly designated according to the optical rotation they effect, by and , L and D , 1 and d or combinations of these symbols. The symbols S and R stand for sinister and rectus respectively and designate an absolute spatial configuration of the enantiomer. The S isomer is a preferred isomer configuration. The pyridines of the present invention can be prepared by any convenient process. One such process involves the coupling of a halopyridine with a suitable substituted oxazolidine and hydrolyzing the reaction product obtained. This process is illustrated by the following set of reaction equations Reaction AEMI8.1 EMI9.1 Halo may be C1, Br and I, with C1 being preferred. M is an alkali metal, either potassium or sodium. Y can be hydrogen or the residue of any suitable aldehydeEMI9.2 e.g. an arylaldehyde, such as benzaldehyde, naphthaldehyde and the like, or an alkanal such as acetaldehyde, butyraldehyde and the like. The process for preparing oxazolidines where M is hydrogen is disclosed in U.S. 3,718,647 and U.S. 3,657,237 and to the extent necessary the pertinent disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.The alkali metal salt of the oxazolidine is prepared in a conventional manner by reaction of the corresponding hydroxymethyloxazolidine with an appropriate amount of an alkali base reactant. However, this Reaction A may also be carried out with in situ formation of the alkali metal oxazolidine salt Formula VI by reacting the oxazolidineEMI10.1 with the Formula V pyridine in the presence of a strong base such as an alkali metal alkoxide e.g. K O C CH3 3 or sodium hydride. The coupling reaction can be carried out at temperatures ranging from about OOC to the reflux temperature of the solvent. A temperature range of about 1000 to about 750C is preferred. The reaction is generally carried out in a solvent. Any suitable solvent may be used. Examples of useful solvents are dimethylformamide, dimethylsufoxide, hexamethylphosphoramide, tert butanol, alkanols and the like.The hydrolysis is carried out using conventional acid hydrolysis reagent and techniques e.g. treatment with a solution of an acid such as acetic acid or any strong mineral acid such as HC1 or H2SO4. The hydrolysis product can be directly obtained as the salt of the acid used for the hydrolysis. Ordinarily, the product I is recovered as the free base after conventional neutralization of the salt. The coupling reaction is ordinarily carried out at atmospheric pressure. Higher pressures may be used if desired. When a racemic oxazolidine Formula VI or VIII is used as a reactant, the product is obtained as a racemate. The racemate may be separated into its individual enantiomers by conventional resolution techniques. When Y in the oxazolidine e.g. Formula VI orVIII is other than hydrogen, in addition to the chiral center at oxazolidine position 5 there is a second chiral center at position 2. However, whenever the oxazolidine is designated e.g. as S , R or R,S , this designation refers only to the optical configuration around the carbon atom at the 5 position. By using a single optical isomer of said oxazolidine in the above reactions, the product may be obtained directly as a single enantiomer. Thus, if the S isomer of the oxazolidine is used, then the product obtained will be the S isomer. This provides a convenient way for directly preparing individual isomers of the present pyridines. The intermediates of Formula V may be prepared by any conventional process. Especially useful processes involve the condensation of alkylidenemalononitriles or alkylidinecyanoacetates with either HC OC2H5 3 or dimethylformamide dimethylacetalEMI11.1 and cycli ng the unsaturated intermediate product with acid c provide Formula V compounds. These especially useful processes are an extension of the processes described byBryso et al in J. Org. Chem. 41 2066 1976 and J. Org.Chem. 39, 3436 1974 . The aforesaid malononitriles and crlnoacetates are prepared by methods available in the 1 erature. The following reaction equations illustrate the conde ation reactions METHOD AEMI12.1 METHOD BEMI12.2 EMI13.1 The intermediate pyridines of Formula V having a CF3 substituent are obtained by hydrolyzing the ester group to the acid COOH and treating this derivative with a fluorinating agent e.g. SF4 HF to obtain the OF3 group. Pyridines of the present invention wherein R1 is other than hydrogen are conveniently prepared by treating the corresponding pyridine where R1 is hydrogen with an appropriate acylating agent such as an acyl halide, e.g.undecanoyl chloride, pivaloyl chloride, benzoylchloride, p methoxybenzoyl chloride, an anhydride e.g. acetic anhydride, and the like. The reaction is illustrated by the following equations EMI13.2 The compounds of the present invention also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the novel pyridines. These salts are generally salts of the FormulaI or II pyridines and organic or inorganic acids.These salts are prepared by treating the pyridine with an appropriate amount of a useful acid, generally in a suitable solvent. Examples of useful organic acids are isethionic acid and carboxylic acids such as maleic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, pamoic acid, oxalic acid, pivalic acid and the like useful inorganic acids are hydrohalo acids such as HC1, HBr, HI sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like. The hydrochloride and hydrogen maleate salts are examples of preferred salts. The compounds of the present invention have ss adrenergic blocking activity. This activity is useful in treating cardiovascular related disorders such as angina pectoris, arrhythmia, tachychardia etc. This ss adrenergic blocking activity may also be manifested in an antihypertensive effect of gradual onset after extended administration of the pyridine compound. The ss adrenergic blocking activity of the present pyridine is determined by measuring the ability of representative pyridines to block the ss adrenergic stimulant effect of isoproterenol. Some of the present pyridines also exhibit antihypertensive activity of immediate onset This antihypertensive activity is believed to be the result of peripheral vasodilation via a mechanism not directly related to ss adrenergic blockade. This rapid onset antihypertensive activity is determined by administering a representative pyridine of the present invention to spontaneously hypertensive SH rats and measuring the effect on blood pressure.Examples of representative compounds having this immediate onset antihypertensive activity are S 2 3 tert butylamino2 hydroxypropoxy 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethylpyridine, S 2 3 tert butylamino 2 hydroxypropoxy 3 cyano 5 1 pyrrolyl pyridine, S 2 3 tert butylamino 2 hydroxypropoxy 3cyano 5 methylpyridine and S 2 3 tert butylamino 2 hydroxypropoxy 3 trifluoromethyl 5 fluoropyridine. The observed ss adrenergic blocking activity of the present pyridines in test animals indicates that they are useful in humans as ss adrenergic blocking agents.The ability of certain of the present pyridines to reduce blood pressure, in an SH rat, rapidly and for extended duration, also indicates that the present pyridines are useful to treat hypertension in humans. For use as ss adrenergic blocking agents, and or antihypertensive agents the compounds of the present invention can be administered orally, by inhalation, by suppository or parenterally i.e. intravenously, intra peritonecllly, etc. and in any suitable dosage form.The compound may be offered in a form 1 for oral administration e.g. as tablets in combination with other compounding ingredierts diluents or carriers customarily used such as talc, vecstable oils, polyols, benzyl alcohols, starches, gelatin Erd the like or dissolved, dispersed or emulsified in E suitable liquid carrier or in capsules or en capsulates in a suitable encapsulating material or 2 for parenter r administration, dissolved, dispersed, or emulsifie in a suitable liquid carrier or diluent or 3 as an aei sol or 4 as a suppository. The ratio of active ingredient present pyridine to compounding ingredients will vary as the dosage form requires.Conventional procedures are used to prepare the pharmaceutical formulations. The dosage level for the present compounds may be varied from about 0.01 mg. to about 50 mg. per kilogram of animal body weight per day. Daily doses ranging from about 0.04 to about 2.5 mg kg are preferred, with about 0.08 to about 1.25 mg kg being a more preferred range. Oral administration is preferred. Either single or multiple daily doses may be administered depending on unit dosage. Thus, another embodiment of this invention is a pharmaceutical composition containing B adrenergic blocking or antihypertensive amount of a compound of the present invention.

All temperatures are in C EXAMPLE 22 S 4 Methyl 2 3 tert butylamino 2 hydroxypropoxy 3trifluoromethylpyridine hydrogen maleate A dry flask was charged, under nitrogen, with S 2 phenyl 3 tert butyl 5 hydroxymethyloxazolidine 7.0 g, 0.03 m , dimethylformamide DMF 80 ml andNaH 50 mineral oil, 1.3 g, 0.027 m and heated, with stirring, at 900 for 30 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, 2 bromo 4 methyl 3 trifluoromethylpyridine 6.2 g, 0.026 m in DMF 25 ml was added and the mixture was stirred at 450. After stirring overnight at 450, the mixture was poured into saturated Na2CO3 300 ml and water 300 ml and extracted with Et2O 4X300 ml .The organic layer was washed with water 2X300 ml and cold 1N HC1 3X200 ml . The acid layer was poured into sodium acetate .3H2O 82 g, 0.6 m and the solution stirred at room temperature. After six hours, the solution was extracted with Et2O 2X250 ml . The aqueous layer was neutralized with saturated Na2CO3 and extracted with CH2C12 4X200 ml .The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to dryness. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel 60 and the product eluted with 20 CH3OH CHC13. The crude product was crystallized with maleic acid in isopropanol to give 0.8 g 8 yield of S 4 methyl2 3 tert butylamino 2 hydroxypropoxy 3 trifluormethylpyridine hydrogen maleate, m.p. 126 128 Et2O isopro panol . EXAMPLE 23 S 3 Cyano 4,5 dimethyl 2 3 tert butylamino 2 hydroxypropoxy pyridine hydrogen maleate A dry flask was charged, under nitrogen, with tert butanol 50 ml , potassium metal 0.58 g, 0.015 m , and S 2 phenyl 3 tert butyl 3 hydroxymethyloxazolidine 4 g, 0.017 m and heated at 400 with stirring until all the potassium metal reacted. Then, 2 bromo 3 cyano 4,5dimethylpyridine 3.0 g, 0.014 m in tert butanol 5 ml was added and the mixture heated at 70O. After heating overnight, the mixture was concentrated to dryness and stirred with water 150 ml and acetic acid 9.0 g . After five hours, the solution was extracted with Et2O 2X100 ml .The aqueous layer was neutralized with saturated Na2CO3 and extracted with CHC13 3x100 ml . The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to dryness. The residue was crystallized with maleic acid in isopropanol to give 4.1 g 75 yield of S 3 cyano4,5 dimethyl 2 3 tert butylamino 2 hydroxypropoxy pyridine hydrogen maleate, m.p. 148 150 Et2O isopropanol . The free base may be obtained from the hydrogen maleate salt by conventional neutralization with an appropriate base. Other salts may be prepared from the free base by treating with an appropriate acid.
