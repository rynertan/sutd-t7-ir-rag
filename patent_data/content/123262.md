The above mentioned polymerizable compounds may he used either alone or in the form of a mixture of two or more of them in the present invention. The present invention will now be described with reference to attached drawings. Fig. 1 is a cross section of an embodiment of the semiconductor device of the present invention. In Fig. 1, a semiconductor element 1 is sealed to and bonded with a substrate or supporting body 2 by means of an adhesive 3. Further the surface of the semiconductor element 1 is coated with a surface protective film 4 comprising a polymer containing the above mentioned isomelamine rings and melamine rings. They are encapsulated by a molding resin 5 comprising a thermosetting resin. Numeral 6 is lead wire and 7 is a lead. The semiconductor element 1 comprises, for example, an integrated circuit element. Wires of, for example, aluminum not shown and output electrodes not shown are arranged on the principal surface of the element.The molding resin 5 can be formed by, for example, a known molding technique such as a transfer molding process. The surface protective film herein is formed on the surface of the semiconductor element chip for fulfilling at least one of the purposes of stabilizing the junction, shielding a rays and reducing a stress caused by the molding resin. After further investigations, the inventors have recognized that when the same polymer as that used in the formation of the surface protective film 4 is used as the molding resin 5, the adhesive power on the interface between the sealer 5 and the surface protective film 4 is increased to contribute to the improvement in the moisture resistance. In this connection, the surface protective film 4 may he formed in another step than that of forming the molding resin 5. When a ray shielding effects are required, it is preferred to incorporate a filler having a high purity in the resin. It is also possible to directly mold the encapsulating resin 5 and the surface protective film 4 integrally, omitting the step of forming the surface protective film 4. Namely, the molding resin or encapulating resin 5 may serve also as the surfaceprotective film as shown in Fig. 2. The inventors have found further that when the polymer containing the above mentioned isomelamine rings and melamine rings is used also as the adhesive 3 shown in Figs. 1 and 2, A semiconductor device having not only a high heat resistance but also a quite high moisture resistance can be obtained.A reason therefor may be as follows when the adhesive has a poor heat resistance, decomposition products of the adhesive are formed in a very small amount in a wire bonding step 350 C and they stain the conductor element and the substrate.Therefore, when they are encapsulated in the molding material, the adhesion between the semiconductor element and the substrate and the molding material is poor and, consequently, water is absorbed therein at the interface to cause a corrosion. Accordingly, a polyimide resin having a high heat resistance has been used as the adhesive in the prior art.However, such a resin requires a specified solvent having a high boiling point, such as N methyl 2 pyrrolidone. Such a high boiling solvent still remains in the adhesive after the hardening to form microvoids in the adhesive. Water comes into the voids and the adhesive power is reduced due to the presence of the voids. When a conventional heat resistant resin is used, a high temperature of 200 to 3000C and a long time of at least 60 minutes are required for the hardening.As described above, the above mentioned polycyanamide compound may be used as the starting material for the adhesive of the present invention. The polycyanamide compound or a composition comprising the same and another polymerizable compound is hardened immediately 10 to 600 seconds at 150 to 300 C and the hardened product has an extremely high heat resistance. Further, a solvent having a low boiling point used generally in the prior art may be used in the present invention. Therefore, the solvent does not remain adhesive in the hardening step and no voids are formed. The water absorption through the voids is only negligible.Gaseous low molecular organic compounds containing C, H and Q elements, etc. formed in the step of curing the adhesive by heating deposits on the surface of the semiconductor element and the resulting deposits lower the adhesion between the molding and the surface of the semiconductor element.When extraneous water penetrates therein under the circumstance, the surface of the semiconductor element is easily separated from the surface of the molding resin to form voids.Thus, the corrosion of the Al wires or bonding parts is accelerated. According to the present invention, such a problem can be avoided. As the amount of the isomelamine and melamine rings of the above formula 1 or II formed is increased, the state of the polymer used in the present invention changes gradually as follows state A state B state C. State 3 corresponds to a prepolymer which can be obtained by a preliminary reaction. In using the polymer as a varnish1 it is in state A or state B. In the present invention, the polycyanamide compound or the composition containing this compound and another polymerizable compound the compound or the composition will be referred to as the starting compound herein after is reacted and cured by heating the same in an organic solvent or in the absence of any solvent.The latter is a so called fusion reaction. When the solvent is used, it is preferred to carry out the reaction by heating the reactant first to about 50 to 1500C and then to a higher temperature of about 150 to 220 C. On the other hand, the fusion reaction can be carried out by heating to a relatively high temperature of a about 150 to 2200C in the initial stage.The prepolymer can he obtained by terminating the heating when the reaction product in B stage is obtained. When the reaction is carried out in the solvent, the heating is terminated before a solid cured product is precipitated.In the present invention, the cured product may be obtained directly without suspending the reaction in the B stage.The solvents include, for example, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl acetyl ketone, 2 methoxyethanol, 2 methoxymethoxy ethanol, 2 isopropoxyethanol, 2 ethoxyethoxy ethanol, dioxane, dimethyldioxane, monopropylene glycolmethyl ether, N, N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide and N methyl2 pyrrolidone. These solvents may be used either alone or in the form of a mixture of two or more of them. It is most effective in the present invention to use the above mentioned surface protective film, molding resin and adhesive in their stage B i.e. in the form of the prepolymer . Particularly, the surface protective film and the adhesive are used preferably in the form of a solution of the prepolymer in a solvent. The prepolymer solution has a quite excellent film forming ability far superior to that of a conventional polyimide resin. For example, it has a uniform film thickness, that is, hardly foamed, and a thick films thereof can be formed easily. Particularly, a sufficiently thick film can be formed by a single coating operation. When the conventional polyimide resin is used, the application coating and a heat treatment at about 2000C must be repeated several times.Further, for the final curing of the polyimide resin, a heat treatment at a temperature of as high as 300 to 4000C for a time of as long as about 1 to 2 hours is required and, therefore, its processahility is unsatisfactory. In addition, the characteristics of the semiconductor devices are changed frequently by the heat treatment effected at such a high temperature for such a long time Another problem of the polyimide resin is its poor adhesion to the semiconductor element chip On the other hand, the above mentioned prepolymer solution used in the present invention is rapidly curable 150 to 3000C in 10 seconds to 30 minutes .Thus, the characteristics of the semiconductor devices of the present invention are not damaged, since it can be cured at a low temperature in a short period of time. A known inorganic filler and other additives may he incorporated into not only the molding resin but also the surface protective film and the adhesive. Further, an electroconductive powder such as silver powder may also he incorporated into the adhesive so as to produce a conductive adhesive. In this case, the substrate or supporting body may serve as a ground level.Detailed Examples of the InventionExample 1 a 4,4 dicyanamidodiphenylmethane 80 parts by weight b 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane 20 parts by weight The above two compounds were dissolved in 100 parts by weight of methyl ethyl ketone.
