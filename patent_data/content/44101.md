# COPOLYMER OF ALPHA METHYLSTYRENE AND ACRYLONITRILE, AND OBJECT PREPARED THEREFROM

## Abstract
The invention relates to a new copolymer consisting of 20 40 by weight of acrylonitrile and 60 80 by weight of a methylstyrene, having improved flow distortion character istics. The invention is characterized in that the flow index is 45 at most, the spiral flow length is 65 at least and the ratio between spiral flow length and flow index 3.0 or higher.
