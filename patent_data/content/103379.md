# Method and apparatus for washing wool.

## Abstract
Water used for washing wool is separated into three streams, namely a wax rich stream a wax and sludge con taining stream and a wax free sludge containing stream. Water from the first two streams, when wax and sludge have been separated from the streams, is returned to the wash lng process. Supernatant liquor from the third stream is treated with a flow containing high concentration of soluble salts to de stabilize any wax water emulsion present in the supernatant liquor, and the supernatant liquor is then puri fied by evaporation for re use in the washing process. The flow containing the high concentration of salt is derived from the supernatant liquor of the second stream.
