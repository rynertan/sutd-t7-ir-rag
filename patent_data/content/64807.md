# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO PROFILE CHANGE SENSORS

## Abstract
This invention relates to profile change sensors and is especially concerned with low energy profile change sen sors. In more detail the profile sensor of the invention senses a change in the shape of a relative position or both of at least one surface, or a part thereof, of a body and comprises a source of energy, at least one signal conveying member for establishing a signal path from the source of energy to a signal responsive member with the signal conveying mem ber or a further member associated therewith so disposed in relation to at least a part of a surface of a body that in the event of a change, greater than a given magnitude and in a given direction of the position or the shape of the said part of the body or both, occurrence of the change results in the interruption or establishment of a signal.
