# Method for determining counting efficiency in a liquid scintillation counting system.

## Abstract
Method to determine the degree of chemical quench and the degree of colour quench in liquid scintillation samples in order to find the correct counting efficiency for the samples. Scintillation pulses produced by the liquid scintillation solution as a result of an isotopic decay or in response to radiation from an external Î³ radiating source, are counted in a counter comprising two photodetectors working in coinci dance, means for determining the value of one quench parameter dependent on the overall level of quench in the solution, and means for determining the value of another quench parameter predominantly dependent on the level of colour quench in the solution. The counting efficiency for the sample can be determined on the basis of these two quench parameters.
