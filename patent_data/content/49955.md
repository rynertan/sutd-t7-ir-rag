# Dual cavity pressure sensor.

## Abstract
A silicon chip 38 mounted on a glass base 34 has two cavities 44, 46 formed therein, each defining a diaphragm 48, 50 . Ion implanted resistors 52 are formed in each diaphragm and are connected to a Wheatstone bridge circuit. One of the chip cavities 46 is evacuated to a vacuum reference pressure so that barometric pressure is sensed by the corresponding diaphragm 50 when the atmospheric pressure is applied to the top of the chip 38 . The other cavity 44 is connected to a pressure source, such as manifold vacuum of an internal combustion engine so that the corresponding diaphragm 48 will measure the differen tial pressure between the manifold and atmosphere. The output signals of the bridge circuits are combined in such a way as to give a sensor output proportional to the absolute manifold pressure.

## Description
DUAL CAVITY PRESSURE SENSOR This invention relates to pressure sensors of the semiconductor diaphragm type. In fuel control circuits for internal combustion engines, it is sometimes required to obtain an electrical signal proportional to the manifold absolute pressure. For this purpose it has been proposed to use pressure sensors comprising a chip of semiconductor material having a cavity formed in one surface to form a thin diaphragm with the other surface. A piezoresistive bridge circuit formed on the diaphragm, when connected into a transducer circuit, provides an electrical signal indicative of the pressure differential across the diaphragm. Thus, by evacuating the cavity to a vacuum reference and applying the manifold pressure to the other side of the diaphragm, a signal representing manifold absolute pressure can be obtained.Contaminants in the manifold exhaust gases applied to the sensor can cause degradation of the circuit formed on the diaphragm and of the electrical leads extending from the diaphragm to external circuitry. A proposed technique for avoiding that problem is to use two pressure sensor chips both having their top surface exposed to atmospheric pressure, one having its cavity at a vacuum reference pressure and the other having its cavity connected to the manifold pressure. That arrangement confines the manifold exhaust gases to the cavity and prevents them from reaching the upper surface of the sensor chips, thus protecting the circuitry thereon. However, it does require two chips thereby greatly increasing the cost of the pressure transducer. It is therefore a general object of the invention to provide a pressure sensor having two pressure sensing diaphragms on a single chip without the attendant cost of two separate sensors.. The invention is carried out by providing a semiconductor chip with two cavities formed therein, each defining a diaphragm between the cavity and a flat surface of the.chip with one cavity at a reference pressure, the other cavity being connected to a first pressure source and the flat side of the chip opposite the cavities being exposed to a second pressure source, and a piezoresistive bridge on the flat surface of each diaphragm so that the bridges, when energized, will have outputs corresponding to the pressure dif ferences across the respective diaphragms. The above and other advantages will be made more apparent in the following specification taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts and wherein Figure 1 is a cross sectional elevational view of the pressure sensor package containing a pressure sensor according to the invention Figure 2 is a cross sectional elevational view of the pressure sensor of Figure 1 taken along a section at right angles to the section of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a plan view of the pressure sensor chip taken along lines 3 3 of Figure 2 and Figure 4 is a schematic circuit diagram illustrating a transducer circuit incorporating the pressure sensor of Figure 1. Figure 1 shows the pressure sensor package which includes a housing 10 of generally rectangular configuration which comprises a wall for the package.A plurality of terminals 12 insert moulded in the housing 10 extend laterally through one side of the housing and terminate inside the housing for connection with the sensor leads. The housing has along its upper and lower surfaces grooves 14 and 16 for mating with a cover 18 and a base 20 respectively, which are also generally rectangular and will be coextensive with the outer periphery of the housing 10 The cover 18 includes a rib 22 along tis periphery to mate with the groove 14 of the housing 10. A vent 24 in the cover admits atmospheric pressure to the interior of the sensor package.The base 20 also has a rib 26 which mates. with the.groove 16 of t he housing 10 and has a tubular portion 28 dependent from and perpendicular to its lower surface and which is axially aligned with a port 30 extending through the base 20 to the interior of the package 10. Each of the housing parts 10, 18 and 20 are mouldednf a polymer material, such as a polyester, and are secured together at their mating surfaces by an adhesive, such as a room temperature vulcanizable RTV adhesive. These parts are easily and inexpensively manufactured and assembled. The pressure sensor 32 comprises a glass plate 34 having a hole 36 therethrough aligned with the port 30, the plate being secured to the base 20 by RTV adhesive. A silicon chip 38 is anodically bonded to the upper surface of the glass plate 34.As better shown in Figure 2, the chip 38 has an upper planar surface 40 and a lower mounting surface 42 in contact with the plate 34. A pair of cavities 44 and .46 of generally rectangular cross section, as shown in Figure 3, are formed in the mounting surface 42 of the chip 38 so that the cavity 44 is in communication with the hole 36 of the plate 34 and the cavity 46 is completely sealed. The process of anodically bonding the chip to the glass plate is performed in an evacuated chamber held at a predetermined degree of vacuum, say 5 x 10 3 microns Hg, so that the cavity 46 is sealed at that fixed vacuum or reference pressure.A first diaphragm 48 is defined by the cavity 44 and the upper or planar surface 40 of the chip 38. A second diaphragm 50 is defined by the cavity 46 and the upper surface 40 of the chip. The diaphragms are preferably about 0.0254 InIn 0.001 inch tnick when the whole chip thickness is about 0.405mum 0.016 incn . When the vent 24 of Figure 1 is vented to atmosphere, the deflection of the diaphragm 50 will be determined by the pressure thereacross which is the difference of the atmospheric pressure and the vacuum reference in the cavity 46, thereby.providing Ã…an absolute barometric pressure response.If the tube 28 is connected to an engine manifoldj the diaphragm 48 is deflected according to the difference .between the manifold pressure and the atmospheric pressure, therefore, responding to the manifold gauge pressure. Four resistors 52 are formed in each of the diaphragms by ion implantation. The resistors exhibit a piezoresistive effect so that the resistance values depend upon the diaphragm deflection. The four resistors of each diaphragm are connected into a bridge configuration. These circuits contain contact pads, not shown, which are connected by wire bonds 54 to the terminal conductors 12. Figure 4 illustrates a specific circuit for the accurate derivation of manifold absolute pressure from the output of the two bridges. The bridge 48 is that bridge on the diaphragm 48 made up of the ion implanted resistors 52 and the bridge 50 is made up of the similar resistors implanted on the diaphragm 50.The bridges are connected in parallel to an input circuit comprising a parallel combination of an NTC thermistor 56 and a resistor 58 connected between a regulated voltage source V and upper input corners of the bridges 48 and 50 . The lower input corners of the bridges are connected through a similar parallel circuit comprising a thermistor 60 and resistor 62 to ground. The purpose of the thermistor network is to provide a temperature compensation function for the bridges. Normally the bridge outputs would vary with temperature at a different rate for each pressure.The compensation network adjusts for temperature so that the bridge outputs vary with temperature at the same rate for each pressure The outputs of the bridges are connected to inputs of an operational amplifier to subtractively combine the bridge output signals. Thus any change in atmospheric pressure will change both bridge outputs equally and the changes will cancel out and not effect the combined signal. Specifically one output corner of the bridge 48 is connected through a resistor 64 and a resistor 66 to the negative input terminal of an operational amplifier 68 and the other output corner of the bridge 48 is connected through a resistor 70 and resistor 72 to the positive input terminal of the amplifier 68.The bridge 50 has one output corner connected through a resistor 74 to the junction of the resistors 64 and 66 while the other output corner is connected through a resistor 76 to the junction of the resistors 70 and 72. The resistors 64, 74, 70 and 76 are all equal in value and are much larger in value than the resistors 66 and 72. The output of the amplifier 68, V0, is the voltage representing the manifold absolute pressure.A feedback resistor 78 extends between the amplifier output and its negative input. The positive input terminal of the amplifier 68 is connected to another temperature compensating circuit, which comprise resistors 80 and 82 serially connected to ground, a resistor 84 and NTC thermistor 86 serially connected between the regulated voltage V and ground, the junction point of the resistors 80 and 82 being connected to the junction point of the resistor thermistor pair 84, 86. This thermistor compensating network renders the bridge output vs. temperature curves horizontal so that the combined bridge output will be independent of temperature. It will thusbe seen that by combining two diaphragms on a single silicon chip, one being disposed between a vacuum reference cavity and atmospheric pressure andthe other being disposed between atmospheric pressure and cavity containing manifold pressure and by properly combining the outputs of piezoresistive bridges situated on each diaphragm, a signal voltage proportional to the manifold absolute pressure is readily generated. Moreover, with this structure, the bridge circuitry and interconnecting conductors in the sensor package are isolated from the manifold exhaust gases, thereby protecting the electrical circuitry from contaminants in those gases.
