# A calculating rule useful for making eyeglasses.

## Abstract
A calculating rule for obtaining ophthalmic values which are necessary for making eyeglasses, such as near point distance, far point distance, visual range, and ad dition, especially by which the eyeglasses wearer can continue his work at the objective working distance with no asthenopia based on accommodation, etc., and for obtaining the resultant prism diopter and base direction of the prism for correcting heterophoria. The calculating rule comprises a rectangular slide rule and a circular rotating rule the slide rule comprising a fixed rule consisting of scale A of accom modation and scale D of near point distance, and a slide rule consisting of scale B of power of the ametropia equal to addition and scale C of far point distance, and the marks for indicating, on the scale D , near point distance, and the objective working distances with no asthenopia which vary in accordance with the accom modations the circular rotating rule comprising a fixed circular rule E and a rotating circular rule F .
