# Fibrous composite materials and the production and use thereof.

## Abstract
A fibrous composite material comprising carbon fibres and chemically delaminated vermiculite lamellae and pro duction of the material by applying a suspension preferably an aqueous suspension of the lamellae to carbon fibres and removing the liquid medium from the suspension. The composite material is useful for the insulation and fire protection of substrates.
