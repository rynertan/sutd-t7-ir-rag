# PAIRED ELECTRODES FOR PLASMA CHAMBERS

## Abstract
A paired electrode for use in a plasma chamber. In one embodiment, the paired electrode 10 comprises a plurality of angle members 18, 20 which are disposed parallel to one another. Pairs 18, 20 of the angle members are positioned facing one another, one 18 functioning as a power electrode member and the other 20 as a ground electrode member. All of the power electrode members 18 are rigidly fastened to one another by means of a transverse power bus 30 and all of the ground electrode members 20 are rigidly fastened to one another by means of a transverse ground bus 32 . The power bus 30 and the ground bus 32 are electrically connected to a power source, usually a RF power source 26 , and a ground 28 of the plasma chamber 12 , respectively. The plasma chamber 12 contains a plurality of paired electrodes 10 , and objects to be processed by plasma are placed between the paired elec trodes 10 .
