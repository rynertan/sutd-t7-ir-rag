# Ultrasonic probe.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic probe for used in an ultrasonic diagnosis device is disclosed. The ultrasonic probe of this invention com prises an oscillator unit 14 having a first rotatable composite oscillator 1 which includes oscillators 3, 4 having inherent center frequencies different from each other, the oscillators being disposed back to back and a second rotatable, frame shaped composite oscillator 5 which is disposed around the first composite oscillator and includes oscillators 7, 8 having inherent center frequencies different from each other, the os cillators being disposed back to back. The rotating shafts 10, 11 of the first and second composite oscillators are disposed concentrically in such a manner as to be freely brought into and out of mutual engagement. The oscillator unit it disposed together with an acoustic propagation liquid 17 within an acoustic window 16 , and means for driving 18 and controll ing 19 the respective oscillators or the oscillator unit are dis posed within the box 15 of the ultrasonic probe.
