## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION Substance conjugated Complement Component ClqBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to a substance conjugated complement component Clq and a process for preparing the same, and a method for measurement, using the substance conjugated complement component Clq. More particularly, it relates to a complement component Clq conjugated with various substances including markers and cell function regulating substances and a process for preparing the same, and also to a process for measurement, using such a substance conjugated complement component Clq.Related Art Statement It has,hitherto been known to utilize the complement fixation reaction for the measurement or determination of antibodies in blood serum and antigens, such as microorganisms, physiologically active substances and chemicals. This known method makes use of the serial reactions wherein complement components C1 to C9 are bound successively to an antibody specifically bound to an antigen. In detail, this known method comprises the step of adding an excess amount of complement components to the formed antigen antibody complex, the step of determining an amount of residual complement components through the hemolysis, and the step of determining the amount of fixed complement components from the degree of hemolysis.The quantity of the antigen or antibody is then estimated from the results of the amount of the fixed complement components.In the hemolysis, complement components act on the sensitized erythrocytes including sheep red blood cells and anti sheep red blood cell antisera so that the complement components may be determined while using the hemolysis of the sheep red blood cells as the index. Hovever, practical determination operation of the hemolysis is extremely complex and needs high level skill and knowledge. In addition, this known method has a relatively lov sensitivity and requires two days for the determination operation. Various methods have been proposed to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages of the known method as described in the preceding paragraph. For example, Japanese PatentLaid Open Publication No. 43498 1980 discloses one of such methods. In the method proposed by the antecedent Publication referred to above, an antibody which binds, as an antigen, a complement component being bound to another antibody is labelled with an enzyme, and the amount of the thus labelled antibody is determined by the enzymatic activity thereof,This method is, therefore, one of the so called enzyme labelled antibody techniques. However, this method involves two step reactions, since a labelled antibody which binds, as an antigen, a complement component must be used. Accordingly, rinsing operations are required after each of the reactions, leading to increase in labor and time.In fact, this determination method costs much time as several hours. On the other hand, a method of determining a neutralizing antibody has been made known, for example, by Takashi Kitamura, Tissue Culture Technology forInspection of Virus , published by KINDAI SHUPPAN 1980 , page 246. When an antibody against poliovirus, for instance, is determined by this method, cultivated cells originated from human being, a monkey or an ape are first inoculated vith the poliovirus. Meanwhile, the poliovirus does never grow if it is inoculated into cells originated from the sources other than human being, a monkey or an ape. The cells inoculated with the poliovirus collapse and are deseased as the result of cytopathogenesis due to propagation of the virus.Hovever, the reaction product of a neutralizing antibody and the virus, the infectiousness of virus being neutralized by the neutralizing antibody , can not propagate even if it is inoculated upon a cell originated from human being or monkey so that the cell is kept to have normal form and functions. Making use of this principle, a specific virus is reacted with blood serum and then the titre of the neutralizing antibody is determined by inspecting the presence or absence, and the degree if present,of plaque and CPE cytopathogenic effect . However, when the poliovirus is determined by the method described in the preceding paragraph, the poliovirus must be cultivated for about 7 days in a normal test in addition to the fact that the inspection and judgement of the result should be made by a skilled person rather than being easily conducted by a person having ordinary or middle level skill. For this reason, an order of test for the determination of neutralizing antibody is not accepted even by a large scale inspection center at the present day. On the other hand, as a method for determining antigens or antibodies in a simpler way, there has been known in the art a method wherein properties of complement component C1q binding an antigen antibody complex is utilized. Simpson et al., Jounal of Immunological Methods , Vol. 67, 167 to 172 1984 . In this known method, glutalaldehyde or periodic acid is conjugated to the complement component Clq as a cross linker, and peroxidase enzyme is conjugated via said cross linker to the complement component C1q as a marker.Marchalonis J. J., Biochemical Journal , Vol. 113, pp2Z9 to 305 1969 discloses a method in which radioactive iodine is conjugated to the complement component Ciq through the chloramine T method as a marker. However, in these known methods, an enzyme or radioactive iodine is coupled with each of the complement component Clq molecules via an amino group present on the molecule generally and at random, resulting in entire modification of the molecule since the very site of each molecule having inherent properties capable of binding to an immunocomplex has been chemically modified by said crosslinker or coupler. Accordingly, the binding activity of such a marker labelled complement component Clq for binding to an antigen antibody complex is seriously lowered to a level not acceptable for quantitative measurement as a reagent. Moreover, a false positive reaction takes place frequently by the latent presence of said cross linker in the marker labelled complement component Clq to make it impossible to continue the determination operations. It has, thus, been impossible to provide a reliable determination method for determining an antigen or antibody in a precise and reproducible manner by the use of the complement component Clq.OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF TIlE INVENTION It is, therefore, a primary object of this invention to provide a complement component Clq which is conjugated with a variety of substances, such as markers or cell function regulating substances, while preserving its inherent binding capacity for binding with an immunocomplex without any detraction, and a process for preparing such a complement component Clq, and to provide a determination method in which such a complement component Clq is used in a substance conjugated condition. Another object of this invention is to provide a complement component Clq which is conjugated with a variety of substances to be conveniently used as a determination or detection reagent for determining or detecting a specific antigen present in a body fluid or held or bound to a cell or body tissue or for determining or detecting the corresponding antibody for the specific antigen, a modified immunoglobulin or immunocomplex, and a process for preparing such a complement component Clq, and to provide a determination method in which such a complement component Clq is used in a substance conjugated condition. A further object of this invention is to provide a complement component Clq which is conjugated with a variety of substances to be conveniently used as a curing agent or medicine for regulating physiological function of a variety of cells which have cell surface structures identified by specific antibodies or which can capture specific immunocomplexes or complements, and a process for preparing such a complement component Clq, and to provide a determination method in which such a complement component Clq is used in a substance conjugated condition. A still further object of this invention is to provide a determination method utilizing a complement component Clq, which is simple and easy in determination operation and can be conducted for a short operation time even by an unskilled person. Yet a further object of this invention is to provide a determination method utilizing a complement component Clq, which has high sensitivity to give reproducible result of determination. The above and other objects of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description thereof. According to the present invention, there is provided a complement component Clq wherein a substance is conjugated via a sulfur atom to at least one site of said component, said site being not involved in binding immunoglobulins. Also provided in accordance with this invention is a process for preparing a substance conjugated complement component Clq, comprising the steps of a adding a reducing agent to a complement component Clq to cleave at least one S S bond present at a site not involved in binding immunoglobulins thereby to obtain a reduced complement component Clq having at least one exposed SH group and b conjugating a substance to said complement componentClq via said exposed SH group. Further provided in accordance with the invention is a method for measurement by the use of a complement component Clq comprising reacting a maker labelled complement component Clq with a material to be measured, said complement component Clq being conjugated with the marker at at least one site not involved in binding immunoglobulins, thereby to obtain a reaction material having said marker, and measuring said marker.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The sigle figure, Fig. 1, of the appended drawing is a graph shoving the change in neutralizing antibody titer of an anti HSV positive human serum in Example 15, one of the examples of the invention.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention will now be decribed in detail. In general, after an antigen is bound to an antibody, a complement is bound to the antibody already bound with the antigen to destruct the antigen. The complement includes complement components Clq, Cls, Clr, C2a, C2b, C3a, C3b, C4b,C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9, and each one of these complement components binds to a specific antibody pertinently depending on the specific immunological reaction or allergy rection. These complement components bind in a fixed order such that the component Clq binds to the antigen at a first place, followed by binding of Cis and Cir to Clq, and then the other complement components bind serially. After eager investigations with the estimation that a substance conjugated complement component having a utility when used as a determination reagent or a curing agent might be prepared by conjugating a variety of substances to the complement component Clq, which is the component coupled with an antigen antibody complex at the first place, such that the subsequent binding between the immunoglobulins acting as an antibody and the component Clq is not hindered, we have succeeded to allow a variety of substances to conjugate at sites of the complement component Clq other than the sites at which the immunoglobulins are to be bound. In detail, we have given attention to the presence of nine S S bonds located at the sites of the polypeptide molecule of the complement component Clq, the S S bonds locating at the sites remote enough for affecting the site having the binding capability for the immunoglobulins and being formed by the fourth cysteine residues from the N terminals of the A, B andC chains of the polypeptide constituting the complement component Clq so that they are apt to be attacked by a reducing agent and apt to conjugate with a substance readily. In view of the presence of such S S bonds, we have contemplated to cleave these S S bonds by the action of a reducing agent to expose at leat one S H group in a step a of the process provided by the present invention. The reducing agents which may be conveniently used in this step a include those used conventionally for cleaving a S S bond, the examples being sulfur containing compounds, such as mercaptoethylamine, dithiothreitol, 2 mercaptoethanol, cysteine and glutathione. The reducing step is carried out under the condition that the complement component Clq is not modified. Preferably, reducing may be effected by dissolving the complement componentClq in a buffer solution in which it exists stably and then it is attacked by a reducing agent. Examples of the buffer solution used for this purpose include a tris buffered saline containing 10S of sucrose, 1 mol of sodium chloride and 5 mM millimols of sodium ethylenediamine tetra acetate, and a phosphate buffered saline PBS . The reducing reaction is carried out, generally, at about 2 C to 45 C for about 30 seconds to 24 hours, the reaction temperature and time being changed depending on the specific reducing agent used. It is desirous that the thus reduced complement component Clq be stored in a buffer solution to be used in the subsequent step b after removing the excess reducing agent by means of a conventional method, such as dialysis, salting out process or gel filtration. The complement component Clq utilized in the present invention is a glycoprotein contained in the blood serum of animal, and has nature for binding firmly to the immunoglobulins when the immunoglobulins contained similarly in the blood serum and acting as an antibody react specifically with the corresponding antigen.The complement component Clq used in the invention may be isolated from various aminals including sheep, rabbit, guinea pig, cattle, horse, dog, mouse and human being, and the fraction enriched in the Clq component may be picked up in accordance with a conventional purifying operation. In this connection, reference should be made to Operations inImmunological Experiment B , published by the JapaneseImmunological Society, pp 1376 to 1380 1974 , if necessary. In the process of the invention, a variety of substances is conjugated via the exposed SH group of the reduced complement component Clq at the subsequent step b .The substances to be used in the step b and to be conjugated with the complement component Clq via the exposed SH group include signal emitting substances, such as enzyme substrates, dyestuffs, magnetizable substances, donors or acceptors for electron transfer, radioactive materials, metal compounds and metal compositions, which emit signals detectable by the sensory organs or external instruments, or enzymes or coenzymes which may be modified to emit detectable signals cell function regulating substances, for example, certain enzymes which act on the counter substances conjugated to the complement component Clq to provide the latter with any functions and substances, such as high polymer materials, which capture or fix the counter substances conjugated to the complement component Clq. More specifically, examples of the enzyme substrate are o nitrophenyl ss D galactopyranoside and 3 hydroxysteroid and dye stuffs including the redox dyestuffs, such as methyleneBlue, and fluorescent dyestuffs, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate. Examples of the magnetizable substance are organic iron, such as carbonic iron, and microcapsules containing iron, and complexes of iron with proteins may also be used.The donors and acceptors for electron transfer include a wide variety of substances which take part in the electron transfer and chlorophyll which may be energized to take part in the electron transfer is included in this group of substance and preferably used in the invention. Examples of the radioactive substances are l24I labelled albumin, p chloro 203 Hg mercuriben4zoic acid, N ethyl 2,3 14C maleimide and iode l 14C acetamide. The metal compounds and compositions, other than the carbonic iron referred to hereinabove, which may be used in the invention include gold colloid and iron containing microbeads. Examples of the enzymes are peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, galactosidase and alcohol dehydrogenase wheras examples of the coenzymes are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, flavin adenine dinucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide phosphate. A variety of substances may be included in the cell function regulating substance and conveniently used in the invention, examples being surface active agents antibiotics having activities to vital membranes, such as amphotericinB, and antibiotics affecting the metabolisms of cells, such as actinomycin D trace essential nutrients or growth factors indispensable for the growth of cells, such as selenium compounds, insulin, transferrin and epidermal growth factor hormones such as corticosteroid factors participating in the manifestation of cell function, such as macrophage activation factor factors participating in the cell division, such as B cell division factor anticancer agents, scuh as mitomycin C and toxins such as ricin of toxin of castor bean. For instance, an enzyme may be utilized as the signal emitting substance while being conjugated to the complement component Clq to act as a marker so that it is used as a determination or detection reagent for determining or detecting a specific antigen present in a body fluid or held by or adhering to a cell or body tissue, or for determining or detecting the corresponding antibody to said antigen, modified immunoglobulin or an immunocomplex. When an antibiotic is used as the cell function regulating substance while being conjugated to the complement component Clq, the conjugated product may be used as a curing agent for controlling the physiological function of a cell having a cell surface structure which can be identified by a specific antibody or a cell capable of capturing an immunocomplex or a complement. In the aforementioned step b of the process of the invention, a substance having a group which can be conjugated to the exposed SH group may be directly conjugated to the reduced complement component Clq, or a substance may be conjugated indirectly to the complement component Clq via a second substance having a coupling function, for example, via one or more spacers or cross linkers. Examples of the substance which may be directly conjugated include activated thiolSepharose Trade Name of Pharmacia Fine Chemicals Co. and p chloromercuribenzoate. Any substance having a group capable of conjugating to the exposed SH group of the complement component Clq, such as maleimide residue or SH group, and also having another group capable of coupling with the substance to be coupled indirectly with the complement component Clq may be used as the coupling agent for such purpose. The coupling agent or the second substance having a coupling function, of course, varies depending on the substance to be coupled thereby. As an illustrative example, when peroxidase extracted from horseradich is coupled by the N hydroxysuccineimide ester of N 4 carboxycyclohexylmethyl maleimide, both reagents are dissolved in a buffer having a pH value of 6.5 to 7.5 and containing sodium ethylenediamine tetra acetate to allow them to react vith eath other at 30 C for an hour. The reaction conditions are selected in consideration of the characteristics of a cross linker used. Other than the N hydroxysuccineimide ester of N 4 carboxycyclohexylmethyl maleimide referred to above, N hydroxysuccineimide esters of m maleimide benzoic acid, N 4 carboxyphenylmethyl maleimide and maleimide acetic acid may be used as the crosslinker. A peroxidase having therein a maleimide group is produced. The thus produced peroxidase having a maleimide group is mixed with the reduced complement component Clq, and maintained in a buffer held at pH 5.5 to 6.5 and containing sodium ethylenediamine tetra acetate at 4 C for 20 hours, whereby a complement component Clq conjugated with peroxidase is obtained. At the final step, the fraction of the complement component Clq labelled with peroxidase, which serves as a marker, and having the activities originated both from the peroxidase and the complement component Clq may be picked up through the gel filtration. It is preferred that the step b of the process of the invention be carried out in the presence of a buffer for both of the reduced complement component Clq and the substance to be conjugated thereto , and carried out in the presence of a buffer for the coupler or cross linker in case where such a substance having the coupling or cross linking function is used. In the substance conjugated complement component Clq provided according to this invention, the substance is conjugated at a site or sites having no binding capacity with the immunoglobulins, so that the binding capabilty to the immunoglobulins inherent to the complement component Clq is kept intact without being hindered by the conjugating substance. Since the substance conjugated complement componentsClq provided according to this invention are conjugated with various signal emitting substances and cell function regulating substances without blocking the sites at which the immunoglobulins is to be bound, they may be used for various applications including determination or measurement reagents giving the reproducible results or curing medicines in which their inherent capacities for binding with the immunoglobulins are utilized. The method for the measurement or determination, according to the invention, utilizing the substance conjugated complement component Clq will now be described. The signal emitting substances, as described hereinbefore, may be used in the measurement method according to the invention. Such a signal emitting substance may be utilized as a marker.In detail, a substance conjugated complement component Clq having a marker conjugated at a site that is not adapted to bind with the immunoglobulins is prepared, and then the thus prepared marker labelled complement component Clq is allowed to react with another material to be measured, whereby a reaction product conjugated with the marker is obtained, Subsequently, the labelled marker is qualitatively or quantitatively analysed to measure a variety of antigens, antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, substances produced or appearing in cells or on the surfaces of cells or microorganisms. In this manner, the method of the invention may be applied for comprehensive uses, including various clinical inspections and diagnoses of diseases. One group or category of the substances which may be measured by the method of the invention includes complement binding antibodies. By the determination of certain complement binding antibodies, various diseases of wide ranging hosts including not only human beings but also animals and plants may be diagnosed and judgement may be made whether the hosts are infected or not, the diseases which may be determined by the method of the invention including infectious diseases caused by microorganisms, such as bacterium, chlamydia and virus, tumor and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematodus. Particularly in clinical inspection of such an infectious disease and autoimmune disease, it is a common practice to inspect whether or not a specific antibody uniquely appearing with a certain disease is present in the blood serum.Various measurement or inspection methods are known, and the complement binding reaction is involved in one of the important inspection methods. Notwithstanding that this complementbinding reaction has a utility when utilized in a method of inspecting a certain specific antibody, the reaction has not been frequently uesd, irrespective of the importance thereof, since it involves cumbersome determination operations and requires extremely high level skill. Under these circumstances, a considerable contribution in industrial and medical fields is made by the provision of a simple and speedy method based on this principle is developed to give a reproducible measurement or determination value at high sensitivity. In determination of a complement binding antibody in accordance with the present invention, an antigen is initially fixed to a solid phase or carrier, and then the fixed antigen is allowed to react vith an antibody and with a complement component Clq combined with a marker, followed by removal of unreacted materials and then the marker is quantitatively analysed. Utilizable antigens include viruses and bacteria, such as varicella zoster virus, measles virus, rubella virus, influenza virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis virus, mumps virus and mycoplasma phneumonitis physiologically active substances such as interferon and antigens against autoantibodies such as DNA. Initially, such an antigen is fixed to a solid carrier to form a solid phase.Whereupon, the operations, particularly rinsing operations, can be carried out easily as compared with the prior art technology in which a lquid phase must be handled. Any carriers may be used as far as the antigen absorbed thereby is not easily released from the solid phase, the examples being synthetic high polymers such as polyvinylchloride and polystyrene, natural high polymers such as filter paper, and cells and tissues. More specifically, a microtiter plate and polystyrene beads may be referred to asillustrative examples. The antigen may be fixed to the solid phase by fixing the same on the surface of the solid carrier through physical absorption or chemical covalent bond and the like. In case where a cell or tissue is used as a solid carrier, the antigen may also be fixed thereto by infection. Then, the fixed antigen is allowed to react with the specific or corresponding antibody and a complement component Clq combined with a marker. The antibody is the objective substance which is to be measured or inspected by the method of the invention, according to the aspect of the invention discussed just now, and the examples thereof are body fluids, such as blood serum, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva. The blood serum is used most frequently, since it contains the largest quantities of antibodies. The antibodies determined or measured by the method of the invention must bind to the corresponding antigens uniquely or specifically, and must be capable of binding to the complement components. However, almost all of the antibodies produced in living bodies satisfy the aforementioned conditions, and hence they may be measured by the method of the invention. The reaction of the antigen fixed to the solid phase, the antibody and the complement component Clq conjugated with a marker takes place spontaneously by simply mixing the aforementioned three reactants together to complete the reaction for forming a combined product. While the reaction temperature and reaction time vary depending on the specific antigen or other reactants used, these conditions may be selected properly unless bioactivities are lost. Since the complex composed of the antigen, tbe antibody and the marker labelled complement component Ciq is fixed to a solid phase, the unabsorbed complement component Clq and inhibitors for the reaction can be readily removed by rinsing. The marker incorporated in the complex is then quantitatively analysed. For quantitative analysis, any of the known methods may be used, including visual measurement, observations through various types of microscopes, measurement of absorbance of visual and ultraviolet rays, fluorophotometric measurement and pulse count measurement.In determination of the marker, other than the direct measurement of the marker labelled to the combined complex, a knovn quantity of the marker is used and the quantity of the marker which has not been conjugated to the complement component Clq may be determined to learn indirectly the quantity thereof introduced into the complex. Anyway, by the quantitative analysis of the marker, the quantity of the complement binding antibody coupled to a specific antigen can be learned. In the measurement or determination method of the invention, enzymes are particularly preferred as the signal emitting substance. Since enzymes act as catalysts, the sensitivities of the measurement may be freely adjusted by changing the temperature and time of the reaction. Various antigens may also been inspected by the measurement method of the invention. The measurement of a variety of antigens may be utilized for the detection, identification, quantitative analysis and inspection of various substances including microorganisms such as chlamydia and virus, various physiologically active substances such as interferon and lymphokines, specific antigens for cancers, specific antigen substances in immunological abnormalities, allergens in allergic diseases, and medicinal substances such as hormones and thus the method may be applied for various purposes, such as speedy and reliable diagnosis on a variety of diseases, provision of the standards for judging the effects of curing actions, inspection for doping, inspection for the determination of foreign matters in products, and hygienic or sanitary inspections. When a specific antigen is measured by the method of the invention, a substance having affinity with the antigen which substance is fixed to a solid carrier is reacted with the antigen, and the complement component Clq labelled with a marker, and optinally with an antidoby, followed by removal of unreacted materials and then the marker is quantitatively analyesd. The substances having affinity with the antigen include various types of substances by which the antigens are readily absorbed, examples thereof being antibodies, portions of antibodies containing the sites binding to the antigens for example, Fab, F ab or F ab z , enzyme substrates and inhibitors, protein A of staphylococcus, various mcdicinal substances originated from organismsi and receptors for virus. A living tissue containing a substance having affinity vith a specific antigen may be used without being purified. A selected one of these substances having affinities with antigens is fixed to the solid phase or carrier. By the use of the fixed phase, rinsing and other operations can be simplified.Any carriers may be used for this purpose, as far as the substances having affinities with antigens are not readily released or removed, and the same carrier materials as has been described for the method of measuring the complement binding antibodies may be used. A specific antigen to be measured is then added to the fixed substance having affinity with the antigen so that the antigen is conjugated with the substance. Any antigens may be measured by the method of the invention without particular limitation, as fas as they can be coupled with substances having affinities thereto, such as the corresponding antibodies.Illustative antigens which may be measured by the method of the invention include microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria, products produced by viruses and bacteria, vital components in animal tissues, physiologically active substances of plants, and chemicals. Sources for such antigens are body fluids such as blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva, processed products of meats and plants, and aqueous solutions from rivcrs, sewege or waste water. In the method of measuring an antigen, according to the invention, the corresponding antibody is added optionally as necessity arises. When an antibody or a portion of antibody having an antibody binding activity and a complement binding activity is used as the substance having the affinity with the antigen, it is not requisite to further add the antibody.However, in case where a susbstance having no complement binding activity is used as the substance having the affinity with the antigen, it is essential to add the antibody to be bound to the marker labelled complement component Clq.The antibody may be added at any desired time point after the antigen is added, and may be added simultaneously with the addition of the complement component Clq or may be added before or after the addition of the complement component Clq.Of course, the antibody should be the one which binds uniquely to the specific antigen to be measured and should be capable of binding with the complement component Clq. Typical antibodies used commonly are immunoglobulins contained in animal blood sera, the examples being IgM, IgG etc. having complement binding activities. Natural antibodies present in blood sera may be used, or desired antibodies may be obtained by administrating or infecting animals with antigens. In addition to the immunoglobulins purified and separated from blood sera, inactivated blood sera may be used as the antibodies without purification. The condition for the reaction between the antigen, the substance having affinity with the antigen, and the markerlabelled complement component Clq and the antibody if it is added is not ristricted. Only by mixing the materials, the reaction proceeds spontaneously and quantitatively. While the time and temperature of the reaction vary depending on the specific kinds of the antigen and the other reactants, the reaction condition may be set with the only limitation that the biological activities of the reactants are preserved. Since the comlex of the substance having affinity with the antigen, the antigen and the marker labelled complement component Clq is fixed to the solid phase, the unreacted complement component Clq and inhibitors for the reaction may be easily removed by simple rinsing operation. The marker of the complex fixed to the solid phase is then quantitatively analysed.For the quantitative analysis, similar methods as has been described in determination of complement binding antibody may be employed. Neutralizing antibodies may also be measured by the method of the invention. Neutralizing antibodies are antibodies for preventing infections by microorganisms, such as virus, rickettsia and chlamydia. Refcrring to diseases caused by virus, four instance, a wide variety of viral infectious diseases have been known up to date, including not a few serious diseases. For instance, if a pregnant woman is infected with rubella virus, there arises a danger that a malformed baby is born. Fatal damages are caused by the infection with rabies virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and poliovirus, with the nerval cells suffered unrecoverable disorders, leading to lasting troubles throughout the lifetime.Hepatitis caused by hepatitis virus is an infectious disease which lasts as a chronic disease for a very long time, and a portion of the liver is impaired by liver cirrhosis which might lead to hepatoma. However, it is extremely hard to inhibit the growth of virus by the use of a variety of medicines including antibiotics, since a virus can grow in special living cells, i.e.the susceptible cells, unlike bacterium and fungi. Accordingly, it is a more important counter measure against the diseases caused by virus to prevent infection by virus or to protect a person from infection, apart from the curing treatement of the patients. The judgement on the question whether a person is susceptible to infection by a specific virus or not may be rendered by the determination of presence or absence of the neutralizing antibody to the virus under question and by the measurement of the titer of the existing neutralizing antibody A living body acquires sound immunity after it has been infected with a specific virus and then recovered from the disease caused thereby. This means, in fact, that a system for preventing the living body from re infection with that virus has been established.In other words, a living body has been once infected with a specific virus, the antibody for protecting the body from re infection is promoted, the antibody being referred to as infection preventing antibody.Production and preservation of the infection preventing antibody are very important factors against the infection by the virus. After being infected or immunized vith a virus against the attack by the virus for example inoculated by vaccine , various antibodies against the structural components of the virus have been produced in a living body. Hovever, all of these antibodies produced in the living body are not participated in the prevention against infection by that virus.Only the antibody having the function for inhibiting the growth or propagation of the virus is referred to as neutralizing antibody or infection preventing antibody. This particular neutralizing antibody exerts the principal role in prevention of infection. The present invention provides a method of measuring a variety of neutralizing antibodies against all viruses, rickettsias and chlamydias which infect culture cells speedily and quantitatively on a number of samples. In the method of measuring a neutralizing antibody, according to the invention, a liquid containing a known quantity of microorganism, such as virus, rickettsia or chlamydia, is reacted with a body fluid to be measured, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva or blood serum. At this reaction step, the neutralizing antiboy, if present, reacts with the mixed microorganism . The amount of microorganism reacting with the neutralizing antibody is increased as the amount of neutralizing antibody contained in the liquid under measurement increases so that the amount of the residual microorganism is decreased. Since the content of microorganism in the measured liquid is known, the amount of neutralizing antibody contained in the measured liquid can be calculated from the result of determination of the residual microorganism. After the preceding reaction step, the residual microorganism is inoculated on culture host cells to allov to grow. The cultivation is stopped after the lapse of pre set time, whereby fixed cells containing therein the residual microorganism are obtained. A marker labelled complement component Clq and an antibody against the microorganism are then added to react with the fixed cell to obtain a modified fixed cell to which the marker labelled complement component Clq and the antibody are bound. By the quantitative analysis of the marker, the amount of residual microorganism can be learned to find the amount or titer of the neutralizing antibody. The residual microorganism is, in general, cultivated initially by inoculating the microorganism on host cells cultivated through a monolayer culture on a micro plate to allow the microorganism to be absorbed by the micro plate, and then allowing it to grov or propagate on the plate. It is a common practice to inactivate endogenous enzymes and the microorganism by treating vith, for example, methanolcontaining hydrogen peroxide. Antibodies against the residual microorganism which may be used in the method include antisera, such as low titer human sera and animal immunoe sera, and monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, the materials which may be measured by the method of the invention, other than those described above, are products produced or appearing internally of or on the surfaces of cells,and various microorganisms. The materials belonging to this category include cell surface antigens produced by cells, such as asialo Gum1, T antigen and Ly antigen intracellular enzymes, such as TdT terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase , GTP y glutamyl transpeptidase and LDI lactate dehydrogenase secreting substances, such as CEA carcino embryonic antigen and AFP a fetoprotein and immunoglobulins and enzymes and peptide base substances produced by yeasts and bacteria.The cells referred to above include all kinds of cells including animal cells, plant cells, heterokaryotes, cells of yeasts, bacteria and protozoa, and cells subjected to gene engineering. Microorganisms which may be measured by the method of the invention include all microorganisms infecting cultivated cells, such as viruses, rickettsias and chlamydias. In measurement, one of the aforementioned substances or microorganisms is cultivated and fixed, or simply fixed, and then reacted with a complement binding antibody and a marker labelled complement component Clq, followed by determination of the marker, whereby the substance or microorganism may be quantitatively analysed. EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION The invention will now be illustratively described with reference to examples thereof and comparative examples.Example 1Enzyme Conjugated Complement Component Clq 1 Purification 100 mQ of a fresh rabbit blood serum was dialized through 5 Q of a 0.026M aqueous solution of ethylene glycol tetra acetate pH 7.5 for 15 to 24 hours, and the formed precipitate was recovered by centrifugal separation 20,000G, 20 minutes .

The solution containing the reaction product was passed through a SephadexG 25 Trade Name of Pharmacia Fine Chemicals Co. column equilibrated with a phosphate buffer containing 0.2 mg mQ of bovine serum albumins, whereby a 720 S g of p D galactosidase coupled with maleimide. 200 A g of the 8 D galactosidase coupled with maleimide was dissolved in 0.1 mQ of a phosphate buffer containing 1 m of sodium ethylenediamine tetra acetate, and reacted with 2 mg of the recuced complement component Clq prepared in Example 1 and dissolved in 0.1 mQ of a phosphate buffer containing 1 mM of sodium ethylenediamine tetra acetate at 4 C for 48 hours.The solution containing the reaction product was subjected to gel filtration using a Sepharose 6B Trade Name of Pharmacia Fine Chemicals Co. column, and then processed through the procedures as described in Example 1 to obtain an active fraction, i.e. a fraction containing 1.6 mg of a complement component Ciq combined with 8 D galactosidase. Example 3Enzyme conjugated Complemcnt Component Clq 1 Preparation Generally following to the same procedures as inExample 1, except that a goat serum was used in place of.the rabbit serum, a reduced complement component Clq vas prepared, which was then conjugated vith peroxidase to obtain a peroxidase labelled complement component Clq. 2 Test Using a serum having a CF antibody titer of 16, the reactions of the thus obtained peroxidase labelled complement component Ciq with a herpes simplex virus CF antigen and vith a normal cell antigen were inspected by means of the solid phase enzyme immunoassay to obtain the results as set forth in the following Table 1. In Table 1, the results of this Example are shown together vith the results of the following ComparativeExample 1.Comparative Example 1Enzyme conjugated Complement Component Clq Prepared byConventional Process and Having the Enzyme ConjugatedGenerally at Random 1 Preparation 1.5 mg of horseradish peroxidase vas dissolved in 0.2 m Q of distilled water, and added with 60 A Q of a 0.1M sodium periodate solution, followed by agitation at room temperature for 20 minutes.

Each well was filled vith 0.lmQ of a buffer containing 4x1O3 pfu mQ of HSV. The following procedures vere the same as in Example 14 to measure or determine the OD4l4. The results are plotted in the graph illustrated in Fig.1 wherein the abscissa indicates the dilution rate of each serum and the ordinate indicate the OD414.As shown, for the positive serum, the dilution rate giving the value as large as 1 2 of the maximum OD414 corresponds to the neutralizing antibody titer of 128.Example 16Measurement of Intracellular Substance or Microorganism A specimen to be inspected was picked up from a defected portions of HSV infected patient pendedum or labia , and suspended in 1 mQ of culture medium solution containing an antibiotic. 0.1 mQ of the suspension was inoculated to two wells of a microplate in which Vero cells had been preliminarily cultivated, and further cultivated at 37 C for 22 hours. After the completion of 22 hour cultivation, the cultivated cells were fixed with 3 hydrogen peroxide methanol, and 50 p Q of a human serum diluted by 25 times with a gelatine Veronal buffer pH 7.4 ,the serum having an anti HSV complement binding titer CF titer of 32 or less than 4, was put into individual wells together with 50 p Q of a solution in the same buffer containing 90 ng of the peroxidase labelled complement component Clq prepared in Example 3. After reacting at room temperature for 2 hours, each well was rinsed with a phosphate buffer containing 0.05 of Tween 20 for three times, added with O.lmQ well of a hydrogen peroxide ABTS solution pH 4 followed by standing for an hour to develop coloring, and then the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.1 mQ of a 0.01 sodium azide.Thereafter, the light absorbance of the reaction product in each well was measured. The well added with the human blood serum having a CF titer of 32 had a light absorbance of 0.263, whereas the well added with the serum having a CF titer of less than 4 had a light absorbance of 0.089. From those result, it could be confirmed that the HSV virion vas present in the specimen inspected.Example 17Measurement of Intracellular Substance or Microorganism With the aim to cloning a cell producing carcino embryonic antigen, the cell T3M 4 producing CEA from pancreas tumor was diluted to the limit i.e. to 1 cell well , and then cultivated on a 96 vell microplate for 16 days. After removing the culture medium solution, 0.1 mQ of tripsin sodium ethylenediamine tetra acetate was put into each well to float the cells, and then two plates preliminarily filled with 0.2 mQ well of a fresh culture medium solution vere replicated so that repricas containing 20 Q well of floating cells were prepared.The culture medium solution in one of the repricas was thrown away, followed by fixation of the cells with 3 Hz02 methanol, and then added with 0.1 mQ of a 1 400 time diluted rabbit antiCEA antiserum diluted vith GVB gelatine Veronal buffer and 110 ng 0.lmQ well of the peroxidase labelled complement componentClq. After reacting at room temperature for 2 hours and rinsing, coloring of the well was developed by the addition of a solution of the substrate of ABTS Ediammonium 2,2 azi di 3 ethylbenzothiazolin sulfonic acid . The OD414 of respective wells ranged within 0.127 to 0.386. The cell in the well showing the maximum OD414 was picked up from the other reprica, and subjected to expansion.Example 18Measurement of Intracellular Substance or Microorganism 100 jig 0.1 mQ of purified a fetoprotein and 0.1 mB of Freund complete adjuvant were mixed together and dosed into the abdorminal cavity of a 7 week age Blb C mouse.After 28 days from the dosage of the aforementioned materials, 100 jig 0.3 mQ of of AFP a fetoprotein was additionally dosed, and after 3 days of the dosage of the AFP, the renal cells were picked up and fused with NS l cells. The cells were spread over a 96 well plate at a concentration or distribution density of 1X105 mQ . From the first day to the sixteenth day after fusing, selection by the HAT medium hypoxantine thymidine aminopterine medium was conducted, and the antibody activity of the supernatant of each cultivated well was inspected on the seventeenth day to reveal that prodcution of antibody was recognized at a rate of 64 948 wells and prodcution of anti AFP antibody was recognized in two wells. The cells in respective wells were utilized as coated specimens while being processed by 3 H202 methanol to be fixed, and then added with 20 2 of a goat anti mouse IgG Y chain selectivity diluted by 200 times and also with 18 nag 20 Q of the peroxidase labelled complement component Clq, followed by stational standing for 2 hours. After rinsing thoroughly, development of coloring of each cell was effected in a diaminobenzidine solution, and the number of cells producing the IgG was counted to find that the ratio of positive cells were 62 and 91 , respectively.
