# Lock.

## Abstract
A security lock for use on sliding doors or gates has a pair of hook bolts 6 which are thrown apart or withdrawn together according to the position of a head 4 on a reciprocable slide 3. Each bolt 6 has a recess 39 mated to the head 4 with front 41 and rear 40 driving surfaces, this geometry being related to the pivot points 7 of the bolts such that the head 4 drives the bolts 6 positively between their thrown and withdrawn positions with no lost motion and without the need for spring biasing of the bolts. The slide 3 is deadlocked by a pack of levers 8, to which a second lever pack 9 is linked at X, two lever packs being provided so that non palindromic key stepping can be employed. If required, the slide 3 can be double thrown by successive use of two different correct keys, for which different key hole positions 13 15 and 14 16 are provided to cooperate with the lever packs.
