# Precipitation of polymeric cycloolefins.

## Abstract
Process for precipitating a polycycloolefin from polymer cement comprising mixing said cement with a sufficient amount of a lower alcohol and water precipitant to cause said polymer to precipitate, and separating said polymer from the remaining liquid phase. the polymer cement having about 15 to 80 solids concentration and being a honey like solution in a nonpolar hydrocarbon solvent of a polymer formed by ring opening polymerization of at least one monomer containing at least one norbornene group. The precipitation process can be either batch or continuous throughout.
