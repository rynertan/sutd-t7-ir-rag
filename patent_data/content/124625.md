# ELECTRIC DISCHARGE MACHINING CONTROL CIRCUIT.

## Abstract
In this electric discharge machining control circuit for a wire cut spark erosion machine, the reference voltage of a short circuit judgement circuit, which judges whether there is a short circuit between a wire electrode and a workpiece by comparing the working voltage applied between the wire electrode and the workpiece with a reference voltage, is low ered during a second cutting operation, thereby enabling the electric discharge machining to be effected at a lower average working voltage. An interval signal which limits the oscillation pulses forturning on and off a switching element in a discharge circuit, is blocked during the second cutting oper ation.
