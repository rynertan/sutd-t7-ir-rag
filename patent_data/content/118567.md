From the DE A 2 455 358, the JP A 4948690, the US A 3 852 282, the US A 4 098 999, the Biology of β Lactam Antibiotics , Vol. 2, 1982, pages 143 151 and page 154, and the Cephalosporins and Penicillins 1972 , pages 569, 570 it is known that a wide range of cephalosporins having a substituent in C₂ has an antibacterial acitivity. However, all the prior known cephalosporins are different in structure from the compounds according to the present invention. The above mentioned documents also describe processes for the preparation of the said compounds. The known processes comprise an intramolecular rearrangement DE A 2 455 358 or a substitution of 2 position halogen JP A 4948690, US A 3 852 282 and US A 4 098 999 . The 2 substituted cephem derivatives of the formula II are novel compounds undisclosed in literature and can be converted into useful compounds having an antibacterial activity by, for example, the saponification of the carboxylic acid protecting group or acyl exchange at the amido site in the 7 position. For example, the compound II can be converted into a compound of the formula X which is useful as an antibacterial agent, according to the following reaction equation. In the above reaction equation, R¹, R² and Y are as defined above, M represents hydrogen atom or alkali metal and R represents a group such as that of Examples of phenyl substituted with halogen or nitro on the benzene nucleus represented by R¹ in the formula II are e.g. p chlorophenyl, m chlorophenyl, o chlorophenyl, p nitrophenyl. Examples of benzyl substituted with halogen or nitro on the benzene nucleus are e.g. p chlorobenzyl, p nitrobenzyl. Examples of the carboxylic acid protecting groups represented by R² are alkyl, halogenated alkyl, methyl substituted with phenyl optionally substituted and like protective groups commonly used. Preferred examples of the alkyl groups are those having 1 to about 4 carbon atoms such as methyl or tert butyl. Preferable halogenated alkyl groups are lower alkyl groups having 1 to about 4 carbon atoms and substituted with at least one halogen group such as 2,2,2 trichloroethyl. Preferred methyl groups substituted with phenyl optionally substituted are benzyl, p nitrophenylmethyl or diphenylmethyl. Examples of the C₁ C₄ alkoxy groups represented by Y are methoxy or ethoxy.

Exemplary of the groups are furanyl, 2 methylfuranyl, thiophene 2 yl, 2 methylthiophene 5 yl or N methylpyrrole 2 yl. Representative of the groups are 1,2,3,4 tetrazole 5 thio, 1 phenyl 1,2,3,4 tetrazole 5 thio or 1 methyl 1,2,3,4 tetrazole 5 thio. Illustrative of the groups are 1,3,4 thiadiazole 5 thio or 2 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazole 5 thio. The process of preparing the compound II comprises reacting a cephem derivative of the formula wherein R¹ and R² are as defined above and R³ represents a methyl group or an acetyl group with a nucleophilic reagent of the formula The cephem derivative I serving as the starting material wherein R³ is methyl can be prepared, for example, from a cephalosporin derivative of the formula wherein R¹ and R² are as defined above by the processes disclosed in Tetrahedron Letters, Useful nucleophilic reagents of the formula Y H wherein Y is as defined above are e.g. methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, allyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol methanethiol, ethanethiol, butanethiol or isobutanethiol furan, 2 lower alkylfuran, thiophene, 2 lower alkylthiophene or N methylpyrrole 5 mercapto 1,2,3,4 tetrazole, 1 methyl 5 mercapto 1,2,3,4 tetrazole or 1 phenyl 5 mercapto 1,2,3,4 tetrazole 5 mercapto 1,3,4 thiadiazole or 2 methyl 5 mercapto 1,3,4 thiadiazole. The nucleophilic reagent is employed in an amount of usually 1 to 50 moles, preferably 1 to 10 moles, per mole of the cephem derivative I to be used as the starting material. The nucleophilic reagent which is a liquid having a low viscosity such as lower alcohol, furan, methylfuran or the like can be used by itself as a solvent. When a nucleophilic reagent of the other type is used, the reaction is carried out by using an organic solvent inert to the reaction. Suitable examples of the organic solvent are methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2 dichloroethane, chlorobenzene and like chlorinated hydrocarbons ethyl acetate, ethyl formate, methyl formate and like esters of lower fatty acids nitroethane, nitromethane and like nitro compounds carbon disulfide acetonitrile, butyronitril and like nitriles. These solvents can be used singly or at least two of them are usable in admixture. The amount of the organic solvent to be used is not particularly limited but is such that the amount of the compound I is usually 0.1 to 50 w v , preferably 1 to 30 w v , based on the solvent. In the present invention, the reaction between the cephem derivative I and the nucleophilic reagent is conducted in the presence of iodine or an acid selected from the group consisting of p toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochlorid acid, aluminum chloride, tin chloride, titanium chloride and boron trifluoride at a temperature of 60 to 50 C wherein the iodine or acid is used in an amount of 0,01 to 10 mole per mole of the cephem derivative of the formula I . Although variable depending on the kind of the catalyst and the nucleophilic reagent, the amount of the catalyst to be used is usually 0,01 to 10 mole , preferably 0,1 to 10 mole , per mole of the compound I . The reaction is performed at a temperature of 60 to 50 C, preferably 40 C to room temperature and is completed usually in 10 minutes to 10 hours, although the reaction time varies with the reaction temperature and the kind of the catalyst and nucleophilic reagent. The 2 substituted cephem derivative II thus obtained is separated from the reaction mixture and purified by the usual separation method such as column chromatography or recrystallization. The present invention will be described below in more detail with reference to the following Examples in which Ph stands for phenyl group Ac for acetyl group Et for ethyl group and r.t. for room temperature.

The methylene chloride solution was washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated. The residue thus obtained was subjected to separation and purification by silica gel column chromatography using benzene ethyl acetate 20 1 , giving 108 mg of benzyl ester of 2 allyloxy 7 phenoxyacetamido 3 desacetoxy cephalosporanic acid in 83 yield. Allyl alcohol 2 ml, 29.4 mmol was added to benzyl ester of 2 acetoxy 7 phenoxyacetamido 3 desacetoxy cephalosporanic acid 130 mg, 0.26 mmol at room temperature to obtain a uniform solution. Iodine 2 mg was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred for 4.7 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with methylene chloride 30 ml and the dilution was washed successively with 5 sodium thiosulfate and a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled at reduced pressure.

Aluminium chloride 74 mg, 0.56 mmol was added to the solution at room temperature and the mixture was stirred for 40 minutes.
