# Preservation of structures.

## Abstract
For use in strengthening of natural or artificial struc tures, e.g. buildings, monuments, ruins, there is drawn under vacuum into the structure a liquid of low viscosity and comprising a monomer or monomers containing some polymer which may be polymerised in situ. The polymer may be obtained by polymerisation of part of the monomer or monomers. The liquid resin is cured at ambient tempera ture. Acrylates and methacrylates are preferred.
