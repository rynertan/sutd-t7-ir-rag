# Containing assemblies.

## Abstract
Container assemblies for the storage and disposal of material containing low level nuclear wastes particularly suited for remote handling. A waste container has lifting lugs onto which a reusable grapple beam, made of rectangular tubing joined to form a polygon, is placed and attached to the lifting lugs by hooks. Screw jacks are used to tension the assembly and prevent inadvertent unlatching. The container is filled through the interior of the polygon into an opening in the container. The container may be filled, capped, handled, and the grapple beam removed by remote operations.
