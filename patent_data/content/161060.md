## Description
Copolymerization of ethylene This invention is concerned with the copolymerization of ethylene with other olefins and, in particular, with a method of copolymerizing ethylene and another olefin to obtain linear low density polyethylene copolymers. U.S. Patent No. 3,087,917 discloses a process of polymerizing ethylene in the presence of a liquid reaction medium and a catalyst to produce polymers in the fprm of solid particles which are dispersed in the liquid reaction medium as they are formed. This type of reaction method is known to those skilled in the art as a slurry polymerization process and is widely used for the production of high density polyethylene. Such slurry processes conventionally use isobutane, pentane, hexane or a similar saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon as the liquid reaction medium also referred to as the 7 diluent . However, when applied to the production of ethylene olefin copolymers and especially the type of copolymer known as linear low density polyethylene Lib , conventional slurry processes, including the so called particle form process, exhibit certain disadvantages. For example, the operable reaction temperature is limited because, at high temperatures, linear low dity polyethylene goes into solution and heat transfer and production rates are adversely affected. Furthermore, complete separation of the comonomer and the reaction medium is difficult and product copolymers generally exhibit relatively broad molecular weight distributions and contain undesirably high amounts of wax.The bulk density of copolymers produced by prior slurry processes tends to be low. We have now developed an improved slurry polymerization process for making linear low density polyethylenes. According to the invention, there is provided a method of making linear low density polyethylene, which comprises copolymerizing or interpolymerizing ethylene and at least one 1 olefin comonomer having from 3 to 18 carbon atoms in a single step in the presence of a polymerization catalyst dispersed in liquid propane at a temperature and pressure and proportion of 1 olefin to ethylene such that a linear low density polyethylene product having a density of from 0.90 to 0.945 g cc is formed as discrete solid particles dispersed in the liquid propane and having a narrow molecular weight distribution as measured by an RD value of 4 or less. This method is more economical than slurry processes using isobutane, hexane or other liquid diluents and provides product copolymers having more desirable physical properties. Thus, propane is less expensive and has a lower heat of vaporization than liquid diluents used in prior slurry polymerization processes, such as isobutane and hexane. In the so called particle form process, the use of propane allows operation of the reactor without fouling of the reactor at a higher temperature during linear low density polymer synthesis than does the use of isobutane. Since propane is more volatile, there is more residual sensible heat remaining, which allows more efficient flash separation of the product polymer from the diluent. Since propane is a relatively poor solvent for linear low density polyethylene, the viscosity of the product reaction medium slurry is low and thus the reaction mixture is easy to mix and provides for ready removal of the heat of polymerization. With the use of propane, the polymerization reaction can be conducted at a relatively high temperature without fouling of the reactor. Coincidentally, such high temperatures e.g. 75 850C, and preferably 76 820C lead to relatively high catalyst reactivities. Additionally, it has surprisingly been found that copolymers and terpolymers produced in the slurry process using propane as the liquid diluent exhibit relatively low elasticities, as measured by L values, 5 typically below 3.0, as compared to prior art values of greater than 50, and relatively narrow molecular weight distributions, as measured by rheological dispersity R as described in Shida et al, Polymer Engineering and D Science, Vol. 11, No. 2, pages 124 128 1971 . RD values of products made according to the invention are below 4.0, and preferably below 3.5, as compared to prior art values greater than 4.0 and, in most cases, greater than 5.0. These properties of polymers made according to the invention provide desirably high impact properties. Copolymer and terpolymer products of the invention are produced as discrete particles having substantially uniform size and shape characteristics, as opposed to products of the prior art which are highly non uniform in size and shape, which are often produced in agglomerated form. Comonomers useful in the inventive method are 1 olefins having from 3 to 18 carbon atoms. Suitable 1 olefin comonomers include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1 butene, 1 pentene, 1 hexene, 4 methyl l pentene, 1 octene, 1 decene, 1 dodecene, and 1 octa decene, of which 1 butene, 1 hexene, or 1 octene are particularly preferred. In the case of butene, nearly complete separation of the polymer from the reaction medium and the comonomer is possible with simple flash evaporation. In the case of 1 hexene, additional drying may be necessary, but the load on the dryer is much less than when isobutane or another prior art diluent is used. As is well known in the art1 the proportion of comonomer to ethylene may be varied to give copolymer products having desired densities. For example1 linear low density polyethylene may be prepared by selecting the proportion of butene, hexene or octene comonomers. For 1 butene, it is preferred that from 1 to 10 mole percent of butene should be present in the copolymer product.The corresponding preferred percentage for 1 hexene is from 0.5 to 10 mole percent, and from 0.5 to 5 mole percent in the case of 1 octene. Linear low density polyethylene is conventionally defined as an ethylene 1 olefin copolymer having a density of from 0.90 to 0.945 g cc and having a substantial absence of long chain branching, but a high degree of short chain branching. The polymerization reaction may be carried out in any convenient type of reactor, such as a loop reactor, an autoclave, or a tubular reactor. The reaction is carried out under polymerizing conditions of temperature and pressure wherein the propane is maintained in the liquid state. The critical temperature of propane is about 96.80C and is independent of pressure it is therefore preferred that the reaction be carried out below that temperature. While the reaction may be carried out at lower temperatures, it has been found preferable to operate at 75 to 850C and, more preferably, 76 to 820C, as these temperatures give relatively high catalyst reactivity. In general, the reaction is carried out with the catalyst dispersed in the liquid propane in the presence of ethylene and the comonomer. The copolymer or terpolymer product is produced in the form of particles which are dispersed in the liquid propane as a slurry. Some prior art processes for the production of low density copolymers of ethylene require a pre polymerization step in which ethylene in an amount of up to 20 of the total ethylene and 1 olefin monomers to be polymerized is pre polymerized in the presence of a catalyst which is dispersed in a slurry in a liquid diluent prior to copolymerization with the 1 olefin comonomer. The pre polymerization step provides a catalyst slurry which incorporates the catalyst and ethylene homopolymer. Such a pre polymerization step is neither necessary nor desired according to the present invention, in which propane diluent, catalyst, and ethylene and 1 olefin comonomers may be introduced simultaneously to the reaction vessel. Also, the copolymerization reaction of the invention is advantageously carried out in a single step, as opposed to two step copolymerization reactions of the prior art. After the reaction is completed, the polymer is physically separated from the liquid propane and the comonomer by any suitable means. Since propane is relatively volatile as compared to prior diluents, it is highly suited for flash evaporation separation of the polymer from the diluent and comonomer. If the comonomer has a relatively high carbon number, additional drying may be required, but the load on the dryer is much less than in prior systems. If desired, separation of the product from the diluent can be carried out by mechanical means, such as centrifuging, for example. Any polymerization catalyst which is suitable for the production of ethylene 1 olefin copolymers of the type conventionally referred to as linear low density polyethylene and described herein can be used with this invention. Such catalysts include modified Ziegler catalysts, but modified chromium catalysts, such as chromium oxide catalysts generally referred to as tZPhillips typeW catalysts, are not suitable for the production of linear low density polyethylene copolymers, because they produce products having undesirably broad molecular weight distributions. Preferred catalysts are so called Ziegler catalysts incorporating a transition metal selected fromGroups IV and V of the Periodic Table, used with an alkyl aluminum cocatalyst. Titanium containing catalysts are preferred and catalysts useful in the invention may be supported or unsupported. Suitable catalysts include those described inBritish Specification 2,068,007, U.S. Patent ApplicationSer. No. 590,157 and U.S. Patent 4,499,198. Such catalysts are prepared by reacting one or more magnesium silylamide compounds such as are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,383,119 with at least one compound of a transition metal selected from Groups IIIB, IVB, VB and VIB of the fourth and fifth periods of the Periodic Table and Group VIIB and VIlIB of the fourth period of the Periodic Table.Such catalysts may optionally include one or more of aLewis Acid, a Lewis Base, a hydrogen halide or zirconium tetrachloride in addition to the magnesium and titanium transition metal compound. It is important that the transition metal compound of any catalyst used in the invention be chosen for its ability to produce linear low density polyethylene products having molecular weight distributions which are conventionally referred to in the art as narrow products having narrow molecular weight distributions characterized as having rheological dispersity RD values of less than 4 are obtained in accordance with the invention. In order that the invention may be more fully understood, the following examples are given by way of illustration only Examples A F are not in accordance with the invention and are given for the purpose of comparison, while Examples G L are in accordance with the invention. All polymerization testing in the followingExamples was conducted utilizing a catalyst system prepared as described in British Specification 2,068,007 using hexamethyl disilazane B DS treated silica, a titanium concentration of 1.88 mMTi g of silica and a triisobutyl aluminum TIBAL cocatalyst with an aluminum titanium ratio of about 7.0. The catalyst preparation procedure was as follows 1 2 grams of hexamethyl disilazane treatedDavison 952 grade silica was added to a nitrogen purged flask. After purging with nitrogen for 30 minutes, 20 ml of heptane were added to form a slurry. To this slurry was added a 10 solution in heptane of 6.5EMagala Texas Alkyls . 6.5 EMagala is F n C4H9 2Mg 6,5.Al C2H5 3. The Magala was added to give 1.88 mM Mg g silane treated silica. The slurry was stirred for 30 minutes, and neat titanium tetrachloride TiCl4 was then added. The TiCl4 was added in an amount to give 1.88 mMTi g silanetreated silica. Hence, the molar magnesium to titanium ratio was 1.0. The slurry was then stirred for 30 minutes, and the catalyst was dried at 900C with a nitrogen flush. The catalyst was a dark brown free flowing powder with a titanium concentration of about 5.6 wit. , The polymerization testing procedure used in the Examples was as follows A 2 liter reactor was purged with nitrogen and the desired temperature was obtained. Then under a nitrogen atmosphere the catalyst and cocatalyst solution were added to the reactor. The reactor was closed and 1000 ml of diluent propane or isobutane were pressured into the reactor. Next, a quantity of hydrogen gas was added as a molecular weight modifier 10 50 psi . Then, simultaneously, 1 hexene was measured by a sight glass and ethylene was added to a predetermined reactor pressure. This pressure was maintained by adding ethylene on demand to the reactor. The temperature was controlled 1.0 C throughout a 1 hour polymerization. The reaction was terminated by shutting off the ethylene gas and venting the reactor through a remotely operated bottom valve into a catch pot. Depending on the reaction medium used, the amount of 1 hexene l butene in the case of Example L used and the temperature, the polymer was, in some cases, very wet with diluent and excess comonomer and was filtered to remove the excess comonomer. The polymers were dried overnight, This time was sufficient to remove excess comonomer and to obtain a dry polymer Ethylene concentrations were controlled by varying the partial pressure of ethylene in the system.The vapor pressure data for propane and isobutane were taken from Physical Properties of Hydrocarbons by R.W.Gallant, Gulf Publishing, Houston, Texas. Reference is made in the following Examples to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a photograph of an ethylene 1hexene copolymer with a density of about 0.922 g cc made by the prior art slurry process using isobutane diluent Example D and, Figure 2 is a photograph of an ethylene 1hexene copolymer with a density of about 0.922 g cc made by the slurry process according to the invention using propane diluent Example I .Examples A F Comparative Several ethylene 1 hexene copolymerizations were carried out using isobutane as the diluent. The reactor temperature, partial pressure of ethylene1 partial pressure of hydrogen, and 1 hexene concentrations are detailed in the Table below. Examples A C were carried out at 54.40C whileExamples D F were carried out at 65.50C. In each case, polymers isolated from the reaction mixtures were filtered to remove excess 1 hexene. Despite this procedure, the polymers still contained considerable 1 hexene. When finally dry the polymers prepared at 65.5 C were very sticky and had poor particle size and shape characteristics. The product of Example D is shown in Figure 1 .The polymers prepared at 54.40C had better particle size and shape characteristics and were less sticky. At this temperature, however, reactivity was quite low and a large amount of isobutane and 1 hexene remained in the polymer. Polymer rheology on three samples indicate that the samples have fairly high elasticity, as evidenced by high LS values a measure of elasticity . The polymers also have fairly broad for Ziegler type catalysts molecular weight distributions. The polymerization temperature of about 54.40C is about the maximum polymerization temperature at which a polymer having a density of about 0.920 and a melt index bit of about 1 2 can be made with this catalyst without fear of fouling the reactor. Above this temperature polymer particle size and shape characteristics deteriorate rapidly.Examples G K Invention Several ethylene 1 hexene copolymerizations were carried out using propane as the liquid diluent. The reactor temperature, ethylene partial pressure, hydrogen partial pressure and 1 hexene concentration are detailed in the Table. The product of Example I is shown inFigure 2.Example L Invention An ethylene 1 butene copolymerization was carried out in a liquid propane diluent using the catalyst described above. The reaction conditions are given in the Table. The polymer had a density of from 0.901 to 0.911 and was not sticky. The polymer particles had uniform size and shape characteristics. Examples G L demonstrate that relatively high polymerization temperatures can be used without reactor fouling. For example, it is possible to polymerize at 82.20C without fouling with 30 wot. 1 hexene in the reactor. The resultant polymers all have desirably uniform particle size and shape characteristics. The polymers produced using liquid propane as a diluent gave an additional unexpected advantage in the form of an improvement in polymer properties. The polymers produced according to the invention in a liquid propane diluent have narrower molecular weight distributions low RD and low elasticities as evidenced by low LS values, as compared to the polymers produced using an isobutane diluent. Both are very desirable properties for anLLDPE film resin. TABLEEthylene Hydrogen Polym. Partial Partial 1 Hexene RDTemp. Press. Press. Conc.
