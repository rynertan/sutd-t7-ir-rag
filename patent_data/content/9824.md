## Description
PACKET SWITCHED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM The present invention relates to communication systems and more particularly it concerns a packet switched communication system. As known,the principle on which packet switching relies consists in the establishment of the connection only during the time in which there is a message to be transmitted, in contrast with traditional switching technology entailing permanent seizure of a line during the whole time in which the connection is established. To effect this new switching method, the information is grouped into blocks, the so called packets they contain furthermore the des tiiiation addres so that the switching operation designed to establish the connection takes place for each packet and only for the time period necessary for the packet to be transferred. As a consequence the packet switching network must perform on the packets a number of operations, such as storage of same into the nodes involved in the connection with subsequent waiting in queues of the packets to be transferred over long distance lines, which in such a way can be used contemporarily by several subscribcrs. The nodes of a packet switching network generally consist of computers able to carry out, in addition to traffic control and switching operations, also interfacing operations towards local networks. As a consequence, said computers are not only complex themselves but are also inserted in a complex. connecting network what entails high costs and insufficient reliability. In addition, said nodes realised according to the traditional technology require a lot of buffers for the arriving packets, with consequent higher installation and mainteinance costs. These and other disadvantages are overcome by the present invention of a packet switched communication system wherein the nodes basically consist of recirculating memories of any known type, provided they have the required properties, so achieving a considerable simplification of the connecting network of the node as well as of the control computer of the same. It is the main objeet of the present invention a p cket switch ed communication system applied to a connecting network comprising one or a plurality of nodes, in which, in each one of said nodes, the packet transfer from one connection to the next one is effected by means of ring recirculating memories, within which all the packets arrived at the node from and transferred to any one of said connections are made Lo recirculate while waiting to be routed again. The characteris tics of the present invention will become clearer from the following description of a particular embodiment of the same, given by way of example and not in a limiting sense, taken in connection with the annexed drawings in which. Fig. 1 is the general schematic representation of a node with recir culating memory, according to the invention. Fig. 2 is a basic scheme of a node according to the invention, that utilizes as recirculating memory a charge transfer memory of the type generally knowbn as CCD memory. In Fig. 1 references 01, 02 . . i . . generally denote n bidirectional line terminals stations of known type connected as shown in the drawing said stations are connected to the other nodes of the network through their respective bidirectional connections cl, C2, . , Ci, Reference A generally denotes a ring recirculating memory of any known type interconnecting and in part constituting said stations 01 . . . 0n According to well known technologies, each of said station 0 can extract from its connection c an arriving packet, can store it temporarily, and forwards it, at the suitable instant, into recirculating memory A vice versa it can extract from said recirculating memory A a packet destined to itself, store it temporarily and forward it at the suitable instant along its connection c towards another station. The packets forwarded into the recirculating memory A from various bidirectional stations 0 travel through A in serial sequence according to a predetermined direction, for instance clockwise, as shown in the drawing. The packets recirculate on A till one of the stations 0 recognizes them as belonging to itself and stores them into its buffcr in this way. A acts also as a buffer for the node. Obviously the nature of stations 0 will depend on the type of recirculating memory chosen for A. In a particular application of tl1e present invention a recirculating memory A may consist of a ring of suitable length, made of optical fibre in this case stations c will be of a kind able to extract and launch signals into an optical fibre. In Fig. 2, references CC 1, CC 2, CC 3, denote three recirculating memories of the charge transfer type CCD connected in cascade and forming a portion of a ring, like the one denoted by A in Fig. 1. Reference O Fig. 2 denotes a station of the type denoted by 01 . . . On in Fig. I in the particular exaniple of Fig. 2, as tiie recirculating memory is of kind CCD, station 0 for instance consists, as shown in the drawing, of four shift registers denoted by references Rl, R2, R3, , of two usual logic gates denoted by references P1 .nd PZ, and finally of two buffers of any known type denoted by 13i and nn. It is known in the technique tile working operation of t11e circuit of Fig. 2 for the operations relative to I It. extraction of infor mation in our invention of information packets from intinory CC to be sent over connection c nnd vice versi, for Ilie transfer of infor mation from connection c into memories CC relating to recirculating memory A Fig. l . In the same way it is usual and very simple tecnique to make the information continuously recirculate along the ring of said recirculating memory A. However, the operation of a station like the one denoted by Ot in Fig. 2 is here briefly summarised. An information packet present on connection c is orderly stored in buffer Di, together orderly with other packets that may have bcen previously received. The first packet designed to be forwarded according to the pre determined alternating criterion, is transferred in parallel onto register 1t2. Register R1 is designed to receive a possible information bit present on the last location of memory CC1 if said location is empty, also the first location of memory CC2, at the subsequent instant, will remain empty in this case the signal outgoing from 11 causes the opening of gate P1 and the bit by bit transfer into memory CC2 of the information stored in register Ra. Vice versaJif register R3 recognizes that the possible information bit present on the last location of memory CC2 relates to station 0 in which R2 is inserted, it determines by its output signal the opening of gate Pu with consequent serial transfer into registerR4 of the bits stored in CC2. From R4 the bits relating to a packet are transferred in parallel to buffcr Bu and therefronl, according to the predetermined alternating criterion, onto connection c towards the further nodes of the network or towards other destination points. lL is clcar that what described has becn given only by w.y of nonlimiting exan1plc and that variations and modifications are pos sible, without going out of the scope of the inventioii.
