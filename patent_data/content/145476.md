# TICKET HANDLING APPARATUS

## Abstract
In ticket handling apparatus for a ticket validation mech anism or a ticket issuing machine, a generally rectangular card ticket is moved between an input station 25 and an output station 29 by a transport carriage 1 driven along slideway guides 3 by an air motor 6 . A drive face 5 on the carriage 1 engages the transverse rear edge of the ticket to impel it forwards, while one of the planar faces of the ticket rests against a planar surface 18 of the carriage 1 . A fixed planar surface of the apparatus defined by the outer face of the web of a channel 14 constrains the opposite planar face of the ticket from displacement out of its plane of advance from the input station 25 to the output station 29 . Magnetic heads 31, 35 are resiliently urged into engagement with magnetic material of the ticket on its opposite side from that resting against the carriage 1 during its transit between the input 25 and output 29 stations.
