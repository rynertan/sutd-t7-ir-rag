# METHODS AND MEANS FOR FORMING CONTAINERS FROM HEAT SHRINKABLE ORIENTED FOAM PLASTIC SHEET MATERIAL

## Abstract
A thermo shrinkable sheet material is punched at 34 into arcuate container side blanks having information pre printed thereon. Simultaneous to the punching of the ar cuate blank, a bottom blank is presented at 81 to a forming cone or mandrel 90 . The side blanks are then transferred to a folding station 83 where they are individually folded about the forming cone or mandrel and where the seam is ultrasonically welded. The thermoshrink material is then heated at 84 to shrink the frustoconical container side about the end of the forming cone or mandrel. Vacuum draws the thermo shrink material into recesses formed in the forming cone or mandrel. The bottom side seams at 87 are then seamed and the side seam is ironed to make the thickness of the side walls suastantially uniform throughout the container circumference. The circumerential container lip is then curled at 222 to form a finished container which is ejected for packaging. The apparatus of the present invention allows the use of existing paper cup manufactur ing machinery to make a two piece thermo plastic con tainer. Further, the use of arcuate side blanks results in a container having a sidewall of substantially uniform thick ness.
