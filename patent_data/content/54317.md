# Method of diffusing aluminium from a layer that contains aluminium into a silicon body.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device in which an aluminium containing layer, hereinafter referred to as the aluminium source, is locally provided on a semicon ductor body 1, 2 of silicon and, in a subsequent diffusion treatment, aluminium is diffused from the aluminium source into the silicon body 1, 2, and an aluminium doped region 4 is formed in the silicon body 1, 2, characterized in that, prior to the diffusion treatment, the aluminium source 3 is divided into parts 5 each having an area which is small as compared with the area of the region 4 to be formed, with a mutual distance which is smaller than double the distance over which the aluminium in the diffusion treatment is diffused laterally into the silicon body 1, 2, and which parts 5 have an uninterrupted shape and are so small that during the diffusion treatment their uninterrupted shape remains un varied.
