# Controlling aluminium reduction cell operation.

## Abstract
A method of determining the depth of the molten electrolyte layer in an aluminium electrolytic reduction cell, and using the measurement to control the operation of the cell, is based on the fact that when an anode is raised, the current passing through it drops to zero when the anode carbon face loses physical contact with the molten electro lyte. The method involves raising the anode and noting the distance travel led before the current falls to a predetermined fraction of its initial value. The method is well adapted to automatic control of electrolyte depth.
