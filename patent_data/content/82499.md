# SINGLE TERMINAL NEGATIVE CAPACITANCE GENERATOR

## Abstract
The combination of an amplifier A with a capacitor CF connected between an input and output terminal is coupled to a data bus Bus B reduce the effective capacitance on the bus and thus to enhance the response time of information sent through the data bus.
