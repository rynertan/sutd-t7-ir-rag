# A shift control mechanism of an automotive manual transmission.

## Abstract
In an automotive manual transmission having a com mon fork shaft 80 on and along which a plurality of shift forks 74, 76, 78 are slidable, and a control rod 94 which is rotatable about and slidable along its axis which is normal to the axis of the common fork shaft 80 , there is provided a shift control mechanism which converts the axial movement of the control rod 94 to a sliding movement of selected one of the shift forks 74, 76, 78 along the axis of the common fork shaft 80 . The shift control mechanism comprises a support ing member 92 removably connected to the transmission housing 14 , a pivoting pin 90 supported by the supporting member 92 and having an axis which is normal to both the axes of the common fork shaft 80 and the control rod 94 , a plurality of pivoting levers 82, 84, 86 pivotally mounted on the pivoting pin 90 , one end of each of the pivoting levers 82, 84, 86 being pivotally joined to an extension of the corresponding one of the shift forks 74, 76, 78 , and a head member 110 secured to the control rod 94 , the head member 110 being brought into engagement with the other end of each pivoting lever 74, 76, 78 upon rotational move ment of the control rod 94 about its axis into a given position.
