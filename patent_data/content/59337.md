# High density connecting system and method for semi conductor devices.

## Abstract
A system for connecting a semiconductor chip 70 on a carrier substrate 11 to a printed circuit card 80 is described. The substrate 11 has a flexible, extendable wiring membrane 50 attached to the bottom thereof which extends beyond the periphery of the substrate 11 and in the area beyond the periphery is provided with electrical con tacts 51 . These electrical contacts 51 are mated to complementary contacts in the printed circuit card 80 which is biased from the semiconductor chip carrier by electrical and thermal contact means 91 . The membrane 50 pro vides high density electrical contact between the semicon ductor 70 and printed circuit card 80 . A process for forming the same is also described.
