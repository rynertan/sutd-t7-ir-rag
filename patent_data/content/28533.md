# Method and apparatus for producing ideographic text.

## Abstract
In a method and apparatus for producing ideographic texts, such as those utilizing Chinese characters, a twelve key keyboard 10 permits construction of a shape identifier code utilizing indicia which represent the shape of a character to be reproduced. Preferably, the four corners of the character are utilized to effect the coding. Alternatively, a phonetic identifier code utilizing a phonetic alphabet can be constructed to rep resent the character. The identifier code is used to select from a memory file 32 all the characters corresponding to the keyed in identifier code. If the word to be typed comprises a single character, means are provided for manually resolving ambiguities in the characters selected by the identifier code. If the word consists of two characters, means are provided automatically to resolve ambiguities in the word in accor dance with permissible character pairings. If more than one possible pairing exists, additional means are provided for manually resolving ambiguities in the pairs. Means are pro vided for storing and or displaying the unique character or character pair which results from the selection process, whereby text material in symbolic language characters may be rapidly and accurately produced. The text material thus produced may be used to control the operation of a printing device 44 .
