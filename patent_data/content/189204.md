# Operation data recording system.

## Abstract
This invention is composed of detecting means for detect ing operating condition of a vehicle, operation data recording device D1 loaded on a vehicle for arithmetic processing detected data to write into external memory unit 10, and exter nal data processing device external computer D2 for process ing data stored in external memory unit 10. And of data detected by the detecting means S, numeral value data such as speed, engine r.p.m. or the like are displayed to external display device 6, and operation or non operation data are processed arithmetic to data for memorizing at arithmetic portion 50 to be written into external memory unit 10. While, data obtained from other than detecting means S are input by external input portion 1 of the operation data recor ding device D1 to be written into external memory unit 10. Thus input data and parameter stored in inner memory M is enabled to accesse and to debug at any time through connec tor for maintenance. After work is terminated, data for managing can be input to make external data processing device D2 read data stored in the external memory unit 10.
