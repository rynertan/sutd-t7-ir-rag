# Scoop controlled fluid couplings.

## Abstract
A scoop controlled fluid coupling has a toroidal working circuit W defined by vaned impeller and runner elements 11,12 . Working liquid is supplied to the working circuit W from a rotating reservoir 9 by an adjustable scoop tube 15 having a scooping orifice 16 , the radial position of which is to determine the degree of filling of the circuit W . To counteract unintentional changes in the filling due to thermal expansion of the liquid, the runner diameter is about 10 smaller than that of the impeller, and the runner has a varying size core structure 52 and two sets of holes 54,55 .
