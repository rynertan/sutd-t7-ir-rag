# Vehicular strut type suspension systems.

## Abstract
A vehicular strut type suspension system includes a pair of relatively telescopable members, one 60 of which is attached to the vehicle sprung mass 10 and the other 48 of which is rotatable relative to the sprung mass, and a helical spring 94 disposed around the relatively telescopable mem bers. The spring is seated on the other telescopable member and bears at its opposite end against a retainer 98. A rigid bearing race 82 is disposed on the sprung mass and includes race surfaces 84, 86 parallel to corresponding surfaces 108, 106 on the retainer. A dual function unitary bearing member 114 is disposed between parallel surfaces on the bearing race and on the retainer and accommodates relative rotation bet ween the bearing race and the retainer, the spring and the other telescopable member. The unitary bearing member is fabricated from plastics material which exhibits increased coefficient of friction with increased surface contact velocity so that rapid rotary oscillations between the bearing race and the retainer are effectively damped.
