It has now been found that certain species of photoactivators other than sulfonated phthalocyanices perform a similar fabric bleaching function in the presence of visible light and atmospheric oxygen. These other photoactivators provide in fact not only stain removal but also improved whitening of the fabrics in two other respects the first of these is an improvement in the general whiteness of the fabrics, which is often referred to as whiteness maintenance this improvement is not however accomplished in the ordinary way by reducing the reprecipitation of dirt upon cleaned fabrics, but rather by oxygen bleaching of the overall fabric discoloration that is often present in soiled fabrics even after washing with ordinary detergent compositions. The second respect in which whiteness can be improved by the compositions of this invention is in the removal of so called fugitive dyes the tendency of some colored fabrics to release dye into the laundering solutions, which dye is then transferred during laundering onto other fabrics being washed therewith. Dye transfer removal using peroxy acids together with chemical activators is the subject of U.S. Patent 3,822,114 and of Belgian patentNo. 843,160. This invention relates to a detergent bleach ccmposition canprising an anionic, nonionic, semi polar, ampholytic, or zwitterionic surfactant and fran 0.0058 to 0.5 by weight of the composition of a water soluble photoactivator having the formulaEMI3.1 wherein each X is N or CY , and the total number of N groups is O, 1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein each Y, independently, is hydrogen or meso substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl,alkaryl or heteroaryl wherein each R, independently, is hydrogen or pyrrole substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkaryl or heteroaryl, or wherein adjacent pairs of R s are joined together with ortho arylene groups to form pyrrole substituted alicyclic or heterocyclic rings wherein A is 2 H atoms bonded to diagnally opposite nitrogen atorrs, or Zn II , Ca II , Cd II , Mg II , Sc III , A1 III or Sn 7V wherein M is a counterion to the solubilizing groups wherein s is the number of solubilizing groups and wherein substituted into Y or R is B, a solubilizing group selected from the group consisting of a cationicigroups, where M is an anion and s is from 1 to about 8 b polyethoxylate nonionic groups CH2CH2O nH, where M is zero, s is from 1 to about 8, and N sn the number of condensed ethylene oxide molecules per porphine molecule is from about 8 to about 50 c proximate anionic groups attached to atoms no more than 5 atoms displaced from the porphine core, where M is cationic and s is from 3 to about 8 and d remote anionic groups attached to atoms more than 5 atoms displaced from the porphine core, where M is cationic and s is from 2 to about 8 wherein said alkyl groups are comprised of simple carbon chains or carbon chains interrupted by other chain forming atoms and provided that when the solubilizing groups are sulfonate, the number of said sulfonate groups is no greater in number than the number of aromatic and heterocyclic substituent groups, and either i said sulfonate groups are remote or ii the number of N groups in the photo activator formula is 0, 1, 2 or 3.

A typical listing of the classes and species of surfactants useful in this invention appear in U.S. Patent 3,664,961 issued to Norris on May 23, 1972 and hereby incorporated herein by reference. This listing, and the foregoing recitation of specific surfactant compounds and mixtures which can be used in the instant compositions, are representative of such materials but are not intended to be limiting. The other essential component of the instant invention is a photoactivator as described hereinbelow. This component can also be described as a photochemical activator, or as a photosensitizer these terms are synonymous. The photoactivator is a porphine of the structure EMI7.1 wherein each X is N or CY , and the total number of N groups is O, 1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein each Y, independently, is hydrogen or meso substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl,alkaryl or heteroaryl wherein each R, independently, is hydrogen or pyrrole substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkaryl or heteroaryl, or wherein adjacent pairs of R s are joined together with ortho arylene groups to form pyrrole substituted alicyclic or heterocyclic rings wherein A is 2 H atoms bonded to diagonally opposite nitrogen atoz. , or Zn II , a II , Cd II , Mg II , Sc III ,A1 III or Sn IV wherein if is a counterion to the solubilizir groups wherein s is the number of solubilizing groups and wherein substi tuted into Y or R is B, a solubilizing group selected from the group consisting of a cationic groups, where M xs an anion and s is from I to about 8 b polyethoxylate nonionic groups CH2CH2O nH, where M is zero, s is from 1 to about 8, and N sn the number of condensed ethylene oxide molecules per porphine molecule is from about 8 to about 50 c proxImate anionic groups attached to atoms no more than 5 atoms displaced from the porphine core, where M is cationic and s is from 3 to about 8 and d remote anionic groups attached to atoms more than 5 atoms displaced from the porphine core, where M is cationic and s is from 2 to about 8 wherein said alkyl groups are comprised of simple carbon chains or carbon chains interrumpted by other chain forming atoms and provi ded that when the solubilizing groups are sulfonate, the number of said sulfonate groups is no greater in number than the number of aromatic and heterocyclic substituent groups, and either i said sulfonate groups are remote or ii the number of N groups in the photo activator formula is 0, 1, 2 or 3. In preferred photoactivators, adjacent pairs of R s are joined together with ortho arylene groups to form alicyclic or heterocyclic rings. Benzo substitution is especially preferred i.e. R1 and R2, R3 and R6, and or R7 and R8 are connected together pairwise by methylene groups to form fused benzene rings. Other preferred forms of pyrrole substitution are naphtho, pyrido, phenyl and naphthyl. Where there are Y groups in the above structural formula, it is preferred that Y is H, phenyl, naphthyl, thienyl, furyl, thioazyl, oxazyalyl, indolyl, benzothienyl, or pyridyl. It is especially preferred that each Y is H or that each Y is phenyl. The photoactivating compounds of the instant invention can be unmetallated, A in the foregoing structural formula being comprised of two hydrogen atoms bonded to diagonally opposite inner nitrogen atoms of the pyrrole groups in the molecule. Alternatively, the photoactivators of this invention can be metallated with zinc II , calcium II , cadmium II , magnesium II , scandium III , alumlnium III or tin IV .Thus, altogether, A can be 2 H atoms bonded to diagonally opposite N atoms or Zn II , Cd II , Ca II , Mg II , Sc III , A1 III or Sn IV . It is preferred that A be 2 H or Zn II . Solubilizing groups can be located anywhere on the porphine molecule other than the porphine core as herein before defined. Accordingly the solubilizing groups can be described as substituted into Y or R as hereinbefore defined. Solubilizing groups can be anionic, nonionic or cationic in nature. Preferred anionic solubilizing groups are carboxylateEMI9.1 sulfateEMI9.2 and phosphateEMI9.3 Another preferred anionic solubilising group is sulfonateEMI9.4 providing that the porphine molecule is restricted to 0 3 aza groups, and the sulfonate group is attached to a remote carbon atom as hereinafter defined. Other preferred anionic solubilizing agents are ethoxylated derivatives of the foregoing, especially the polyethoxysulfate group CH2CH2O nSO e and the polyethoxy carboxylate 0 3 group CH2CH2O nCOO where n is an integer from 1 to about 20. For anionic solubilizing groups, M the counterion is any cation that confers water solubility to the porphine molecule. A monovalent cation is preferred, especially ammonium, ethanolainmonium, or alkali metal. Sodium is most preferred. For reasons described hereinafter the number of anionic solubilizing groups operable in the compositions of this invention is a function of the location of such groups or the porphine molecule. A solubilizing group attached to a carbon atom of the photoactivator molecule displaced more than 5 atoms away from the porphine core is sometimes herein referred to as remote , and is to be distinguished from an attachment to a carbon atom displaced no more than 5 atoms from the porphine core, which is sometimes referred to herein as proximate .For proximate solubilizing groups, the number of such groups per molecule, s, is from 3 to about 8, preferably from 3 to about 6, most preferably 3 or 4. For remote solubilizing groups, s is from 2 to about 8, preferably from 2 to about 6, most preferably 2 to 4. Preferred nonionic solubilizing groups are polyethoxylates CH2CR20 nH. Defining s as the number of solubilizing groups per molecule, the number of condensed ethylene oxide molecules per porphine molecule is N sn. The water soluble nonionic photoactivators of this invention have a value of N between about 8 ahd about 50, preferably from about 12 to about 40, most preferably from about 16 to about 30. Within that limitation the separate values of s and n are not critical. For nonionic solubilizing groups, there is no counterion and accordingly M is numerically equal to zero. Preferred cationic solubilizing groups are quaternary compounds such as quaternary ammonium salts EMI11.1 and quaternary pyridium saltsEMI11.2 where all R s are alkyl or substituted alkyl groups. For cationic solubilizing groups, M the counterion is any anion that confers water solubility to the porphine molecule. A monovalent anion is preferred, especially iodide, bromide, chloride or toluene sulfonateEMI11.3 For reasons that are described hereinafter, the number of cationic solubilizing groups can be from 1 to about 8, preferably from about 2 to about 6, most preferably from 2 to 4. Photoactivator usage in the compositions of this invention can be from about 0.0018 to about 0.5 by weight of the composition. Preferable usage is from about 0.005 to about O.18 by weight of the composition, The weight rating of photoactivator to surfactant can be between 1 10000 and 1 20, preferably from 1 1000 to 1 100. Although it is not wished to be bound by theory, it is believed that the mechanism of bleaching using the instant photoactivators involves 1 adsorption of dissolved photo activator on to fabrics, 2 excitation by visible light of the photoactivator in its ground state to the excited singlet state, 3 intersystem crossing to the triplet state which is also excited but at a lower energy level that the singlet state and 4 interaction of the triplet species with the ground state of atmospheric oxygen to form the excited sing state of oxygen and regenerate the photoactivator in its original ground state. The excited singlet oxygen is believed to be the oxidative species that is capable of reacting with stains to bleach them to a colorless and usually water soluble state, thereby accomplishing the purposes of this invention. The mechanism above described is predicated on solubility of the photoactivator in the laundry bath. Solubilization is accomplished by introducing solubilizing groups into the molecule. However, some care must be taken, especially with anionic solubilizing groups, to ensure that there is no undesirable aggregation of the photo activator and this is a function of the nature and location of solubilizing groups. The porphine photoactivators of this invention are especially useful in laundry baths in conjunction with cationic substances. Inasmuch as cotton surfaces are negatively charged, cationic substances have a strong affinity for cotton fabrics and a strong tendency to adsorb or deposit thereon. In so doing they tend to bring down or coadsorb other substances present in the laundry bath, such as the photoactivators of this invention. The porphine photoactivators of this invention contain in their molecular structure certain chemical groups which solubilize the photoactivator in an aqueous laundry bath.As detailed hereinafter these groups can contain a formal electrical charge, either positive or negative, or can be electrically neutral overall in which latter case they can contain partial charges of various degrees of strength. A photoactivator molecule can contain more than one solubilizing group, which can be all alike or can be different from one another in respect to electrical charge. The co adsorption phenomenon discussed alone in relation to cationic substances assumes increasing importance in relation to photoactivators having, to some extent, an anionic or negative charge, whether a negative partial charge a negative formal charge in an electrically neutral or even cationic molecule as a whole or a multiplicity of negative charges in an anionic photoactivator molecule. The latter is a particularly strong effect which has been discovered to apply to the most common photoactivating bleach of the prior art, viz. zinc phthalocyanine sulfonate. It will be remembered that the prior art, however, used this photoactivator in combination with anionic and not with cationic substances, and hence failed to discover the improved, indeed synergistic effectiveness demonstrated by the compositions of the instant invention. It has been found that, for anionic photoactivators having proximate solubilizing groups, mono and di sulfonated photcactivator molecules are unsatisfactory, and hence phot activators of this invention have three or more proximate solubilizing groups per molecule. Compounds having more than about eight proximate solubilizing groups per molecule are often difficult to make and have no particular advat.tage. Hence photoactivators of this invention having prox mate solubilizing groups have from three to about eight such groups per molecule compounds having three to six proxitate solubilizing groups per molecule are preferred, and impounds having 3 br 4 proximate solubilizing groups per m lecule are especially preferred as having an optimum balance of maximum bleaching effectiveness and minimum col rtion. The foregoing discussion relates to anionic photoactivators having proximate solubilizing groups. When the solubilizing groups are in remote locations, the tendency of the photoactivator molecule to aggregate is reduced because of both electrical and steric reasons, with the result that less dimerization occurs, less buildup on the fabric occurs, and the solubilizing effect of individual solubilizing groups is enhanced. Accordingly, a minimum of 2 remotely located anionic solubilizing groups per photoactivator molecule is satisfactory for the practice of this invention, with 2 to about 6 being preferred and 3 or 4 being especially preferred. Nonionic solubilizing groups have a low tendency to aggregate because there is no electrical charge density effeCt and there is a particularly large steric effect reducing orderly association between photoactivator molecules. Because solubilization of polyethoxylated photoactivator molecules occurs primarily because of numerous ether groups in the polyethoxylate chains, it is of little consequence whether there is a single very long chain or a number of shorter chains. Accordingly, the solubility requirement as hereinbefore expressed is in terms of the number of condensed ethylene oxide molecules per porphine molecule, which is from about 8 to about 50, preferably from about 12 to about 40, most preferably from about 16 to about 30. Photoactivators having cationic solubilizing groups do not effectively aggregate at all because the electron density in the ring is reduced. Direct substantivity on cotton fabrics is great. Only one solubilizing group is enough to accomplish the purposes of this invention, although more are acceptable and indeed preferred. Accordingly the limiting numbers of solubilizing cationic groups are from 1 to about 8, preferably from about 2 to about 6, most preferably from 2 to 4. As stated hereinabove, the macromolecular structure comprising the porphine core contributes the essential photoactivation properties of the compounds of this invention. It follows inexorably that large numbers of compounds having this macromolecular core, but with myriads of different substituent groups, are effective in the practice of this invention. One versed in the art will recognize the impracticability of reducing to writing all possibilities that can be envisioned by a skillful practioner. The embodiments which follow are therefore to be considered exemplary but not exhaustive.

The literature contains references to numerous means of preparation of porphine and its derivatives, i.e. to the photoactivators of this invention. One skilled in the art of porphine or phthalocyanine chemistry will have no diffi culty selecting a synthesis appropriate for his particular purposes. Some of the synthesis reactions are accompanied by side reactions in these cases conventional means of separation and purification are needed, such as chromatographic techniques, in a manner also detailed in the literature and well known to the skilled practitioner. It may be said that there are two general preparative routes to make solubilized substituted porphines. The first route is to prepare the substituted porphine of choice and then solubilize it by introduction of appropriate solubi liying groups. This route is especially applicable to the preparation of sulfonated porphines, and is illustrated hereinafter by the synthesis of diverse individual sulfonated porphine species. The second route is to prepare the solubilized porphine species of choice by using starting materials already containing the desired solubilizing groups as part of their own constitution. This route is especially applicable to the preparation of porphines solubilized by groups other than sulfonate, and is illustrated hereinafter by the synthesis of diverse compounds of this type.It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that these two preparative routes are by no means exclusive for these two types of compounds, respectively. Indeed it is possible, within the scope of this invention, to prepare porphine compounds having some solubilizing groups introduced by the first route and some by the second route, with the two sets of solubilized groups those introduced by the first route and the second route, respectively being either the same or different. Illustrative examples of these variations are also described hereinafter. The first preparative route, as defined above, involves preparing porphines by reacting substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic or aromatic carboxaldehydes with substituted or unsubstituted pyrroles. By varying the substituent groups of one or the other or both of these reactants, a great variety of porphine derivatives can be obtained. This type of reaction can be carried out by refluxing the reactants in propionic acid for about 30 to 60 minutes followed by chromatographic purification. This method is described by Adler in J. Organic Chemistry, volume 32, page 476 1967 which is herein incorporated by reference. Any of the resultant metal free compounds can be converted to the corresponding metallated compound by heating with a metal salt of Zn II , Ca II , Mg II , Sc III or Sn II in an appropriate solvent. The Sn II becomes oxidized in the process, such thÅat the photoactivator is metallated by Sn IV . For example, heating alpha ,ss, alpha , tetrakis 4 pyridyl porphine in dimethylformamide in the presence of zinc acetate yields o ,6 Ob tetrakis 4 pyridyl porphine zinc. This method is described by Adler inJ. Inorganic Nuclear Chemistry, volume 32, pages 2443 5 Pergamon Press Inc., Great Britain, 1970 which is herein incorporated by reference. Alternatively, a metallated derivative can be prepared by carrying out the synthesis reactions indicated above in the presence of a salt of the desired metal.For example, if cadmium chloride is present while carrying out the reaction , the resultant photoactivator compound becomes metallated with cadmium. This reaction for producing a metallated compound may be preferred because the presence of the metal tends to increase stability of the desired quadridentate structure and tends to minimize the formation of other reaction products. A completely different route to porphine compounds having fused ring substitution on the pyrrole rings is the condensation and rearrangement of 4 molecules of cyano aromatic or cyano heterocyclic ketones to form a quadridentate structure. This is done by heating in the presence of metallic zinc, cadmium, magnesium, scandium, aluminium or tin, or a metal salt of Zn II , Ca II , Cd II , Mg II , Sc III , or Sn II , and yields the corresponding metallated porphine. For example, the heating of S cyano acetonaphthono in the presence of powdered magnesium gives magnesium tetranaphthoporphine. Similarly, condensation and rearrangement of imides and aromatic vicinal dinitriles yields aza porphine structures as does condensation and rearrangement of aromatic vicinal dicarboxylic acids in the presence of ammonia. Molybdic or tungstic acid or metallic antimony can be employed, as desired, to accelerate the reactions. For example, maleimide will react to tetrazaporphine and phthalonitrile will react to tetrabenzotetraaza porphine. A mixture of metal cyanide together with a ketone whose two side groups are alkyl or aryl and halo aryl or halo heterocyclic , respectively, yields a mixture of monoand di aza porphines. Similarly, a mixture of phthalonitrile and a ketone whose side groups are alkyl or aryl and cyanoaryl or cyanoheterocyclic , respectively, yields a mixture of monoand di aza porphines. Substitution of the meso carbon atoms can be varied by appropriate choice of ketone. An especially versatile method of preparing mono , diand tri aza porphines uses mixtures of pyrroles and carboxaldehydes together with dinitriles or irides. Through suitable proportionation of the starting materials, mixtures of reaction products are obtained that are primarily mono , di , or tri aza porphines, as desired. If pure species are desired, these reaction products can be purified by ordinary chromatographic techniques. A mixture of phthalonitrile, a metal salt, and methylene phthalimidene or phthalimideneacetic acid yields triazaporphine, as shown below. Varying the substituent groups forms substituted triaza porphines according to usual chemical principles. When the foregoing condensation method is used, unmetallated derivatives can be prepared by treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid followed by dilute alkali with cooling, as described by Helberger in Annalen 529, 305 1937 which is herein incorporated by reference. Sulfonation of the substituted porphines described hereinbefore can be accomplished by ordinary methods such as are familar to the skilled chemist. Sulfuric acid, oleum, chlorosulfonic acid and the like are effective sulfonating agents. As usual, higher degrees of sulfonation are obtained by increasing reaction time or temperature or by selection of a stronger sulfonating agent. Sulfonation occurs principally on benzo, naphtho, or other aromatic groups fused directly onto the pyrrole rings or on aromatic groups such as phenyl or naphthyl substituted on the pyrrole rings and also on phenyl, naphthyl, or other aromatic groups in the meso position. Sulfonation can also occur on pyrido, pyrryl and furan heterocyclic groups, and on aromatic rings fused onto hetero rings however the pyridine SO3 salt is often used for these salfonations. The second preparative route for making solubilized substituted porphines is to prepare the solubilized porphine species of choice by using starting materials already containing the solubilized groups as part of their own constitution. When a pyridyl porphine such as q, , , s tetrakis 4 pyridyl porphine, is reacted with an alkyl halide such as CH3 I, a quaternary pyridinium salt is formed which is an effective photoactivating bleach of this invention providing the other requirements are met as set forth herein. Quaternary porphine derivatives adsorb directly and strongly upon cotton fabrics because of their opposite charge. This is desirable however a countervailing factor is the yellowish color of many such compounds which tends to remain on the fabric after washing. The methyl ester of toluene sulfonate may be used instead of methyl iodide as a quaternizing salt. When substituted pyrroles are reacted with pyridine 4 carboxyaldehyde, and the reaction product reacted with an alkyl halide, a number of different pyridinium salts are formed. Aza pyridinium salts can be made by condensing and rearranging pyrido substituted imides or dinitriles, or by condensing and rearranging pyrido substituted aromatic vicinal dicarboxylic acids in the presence of ammonia. Mono , di , and tri aza pyridinium salts can be prepared by using mixtures of starting materials which yields mixtures of reaction products according to the proportions of the reactants. If pure species are desired, they can be purified by chromatographic techniques. A completely different route to quaternized porphine compounds having fused ring substitution on the pyrrole rings is the condensation and rearrangement of 4 molecules of cyano aromatic or cyano heterocyclic ketones to form a quadridentate structure. To utilize this method to make quaternary ammonium salts it is only necessary to start with a compound having a tertiary amino group in the R moiety, and then quaternize the resultant porphine as before. For example,EMI28.1 o , A, r d tetrakis N trialkyl amino ethyl porphine zinc, tetra iodide Quaternary ammonium aza porphines can be made by adaptation of the above method as for example EMI29.1 tetrakis di N dimethyl N ethylamino benzo t , , P ,J tetraaza porphine, octaiodide salt Among the preferred nonionic and anionic solubilizing.groups of the photoactivators of this invention are polyethoxylates , sulfates, polyethoxysulfates, carboxylates, polyethoxy carboxylates, and phosphates. A suitable preparative method for introducing all such groups into the porphine structure is to first make the corresponding polyhydroxy porphine, and then convert the hydroxy groups to the solubilizing groups of choice. Accordingly, methods of preparing hydroxy porphines will be described below, following which known means of converting these compounds to polyethoxylates, sulfates, etc. can be used. One method of making polyhydroxy porphines is the reaction of pyrrole and substituted pyrroles with hydroxysubstituted aromatic aldehydes. For example, pyrrole will react with indole 5 hydroxy 2 carboxaldehyde to form ,J tetrakis 5 hydroxy 2 indolyl porphine. Mixtures of analogous starting materials yield porphine structures wherein the 4 quarters of the quadridentate molecules have non identical structures, according to the proportions used. This method of preparation can be exemplified by the use of a mixture of pyrrole and benzo pyrrole with benzaldehyde to yield dibenzo meso tetraphenyl porphine. In another preparative method, hydroxy cyano aromatic or hydroxy cyano heterocyclic ketones can be condensed and rearranged to form the stable porphine quadridentate structure. This is illustrated in the following examples, showing only one quarter of the porphine product.EMI30.1 Mixtures of the above starting materials yield porphine structures wherein the 4 quarters of the quadridentate molecules have non identical structures, according to the proportions used. Hydroxy substituted aza porphines can be made by condensation and rearrangement of hydroxy substituted aromatic vicinal dicarboxylic acids for example hydroxyphthalic acid in the presence of ammonia. A mixture of polyhydroxy mono and di aza porphines results from using, as starting materials, a mixture of a metal cyanide with a ketone whose two side groups are, respectively, alkyl or aryl and halo aryl or halo heterocyclic , where one or the other or both side groups of the ketone have a hydroxyl group substituted therein. The hydroxy groups of the foregoing hydroxy substituted porphines can be converted to solubilizing groups of this invention according to well known chemical reaction procedures. In this way, porphines can be prepared having the following solubilizing groups polyethoxylate sulfate polyethoxysulfate carboxylate methoxy carboxylate polyethoxy carboxylate phosphate and polyethoxy phosphate. It will be appreciated that one skilled in the chemical arts, and particularly in the color and dye arts, can apply the foregoing principles to make his photoactivator of choice according to this invention. Remote sites are preferred for the solubilizing groups of this invention. Porphine structures solubilized at remote sites have a reduced tendency to aggregate into multilayers on fabric surfaces because they tend to have more bulk and less crystal order hence the intensive blue green coloration of these substances is imparted to the fabrics in reduced amount. Also, remotely solubilized porphines participate to a relatively small degree in side reactions thus the excited singlet state of such compounds is converted more efficiently to the excited triplet state which reacts with oxygen to bring about the intended bleaching of stains.This is an economic advantage. Especially preferred photoactivators are remotely sulfated amino sulfonyl porphines. These compounds not only have the benefits discussed supra for remotely solubilized porphines generally, but also have the added benefit of substantivity to synthetic fibers as well as cotton fibers. These compounds can be prepared by a process involving the following sequential steps 1 Preparing a porphine without solubilizing groups. This step is illustrated by the preparation of all cationic porphines exemplified hereinbefore, omitting the quater nization step and by the preparation of all hydroxy porphines exemplified hereinbefore, where the starting materials are analagous non hydroxy substituted carondS. 2 Reacting with chlorosulfonic acid and thionyl chloride to form the corresponding chlorosulfonated porphine. 3 Condensing with an amino alcohol, using an aqueous medium and a temperature at which may be at, above, or below normal ambient. 4 Sulfonating with oleum. Among the amino alcohols that are operable in these reactions may be mentioned 2 amino 2 methyl 1,3 propane diol, 2 amino 2 ethyl 1,3 propane diol, tri hydroxymethyl amino methane, amino glucose, 2 amino glucose, and l methylamino 2,3 propane diol. The foregoing description concerns compositions containing only surfactant and photoactivator, which are the essential elements of this invention. They are unbuilt compositions.Other components are optional, as the photoactivators of this invention are useful in a great variety of otherwise conventional compositions. For instance, conventional alkaline detergent builders, inorganic or organic, can be used at levels up to about 80 by weight of the composition, preferably from 10 to 60 , especially 20 to 40 . The weight ratio of surfactant to total builder in built compositions can be from 5 1 to 1 5, preferably from 2 1 to 1 2. Examples of suitable inorganic alkaline detergency builder salts useful in this invention are water soluble alkali metal carbonates, borates, phosphates, polyphosphates, bicarbonates and silicates. Specific examples of such salts are sodium and potassium tetraborates, perborates, bicarbonates, carbonates, tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, orthophosphates, and hexametaphosphates. Examples of suitable organic alkaline detergency builder salts are 1 water soluble aminopolycarboxylates, e.g.sodium and potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetates, nitrilotriacetates and N 2 hydroxyethyl nitrilodiacetates 2 water soluble salts of phytic acid, e.g., sodium and potassium phytates see U.S. Pat. No. 2,739,942 3 water soluble polyphosphonates, including specifically, sodium, potassium and lithium salts of ethar.e l hydroxy l,l diphosphonic n íd sodium, potassium and lithium salts of methylene diphosphonic acid sodium, potassium and lithium salts of ethylene diphosphonic acid and sodium, potassium and lithium salts of ethanol 1,1,2 triphosphonic acid.Other examples include the alkali metal salts of ethane 2 carboxy 1,1 diphosphonic acid, hydroxymethanediphosphonic acid, carboxyldiphosphonic acid, ethanel hydroxy 1,1,2 triphosphonic acid, ethane 2 hydroxy l,l,2 triphosphonic acid, propane 1,1,3,3 tetraphosphonic acid, propane 1,1,2,3 tetraphosphonic acid, and propane 1,2,2,3tetraphosphonic acid 4 water soluble salts of polycarboxylate polymers and copolymers as described in U.S. PatentNo. 3,308,067. In addition, polycarboxylate builders can be used satisfactorily, including water soluble salts of mellitic acid, citric acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid and salts of polymers of itaconic acid and maleic acid. Certain zeolites or aluminosilicates enhance the function of the alkaline metal pyrophosphate and add building capacity in that the aluminosilicates sequester calcium hardness. One such aluminosilicate which is useful in the compositions of the invention is an amorphous water insoluble hydrated compound of the formula Nax sA102.5i02 , wherein x is a number from 1.0 to 1.2 and y is 1, said amorphous material being further characterized by a Mg exchange capacity of from about 50 mg eq. CaC03 g. to about 150 mg eq. CaCO3 g. and a particle diameter of from about 0.01 microns to about 5 microns. This ion exchange builder is more fully described in British patent No. 1,470,250. A second water insoluble synthetic aluminosilicate ion exchange material useful herein is crystalline in nature and has the formula Naz A102 z. SiO2 xH2O, wherein z and y are integers of at least 6 the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264 said aluminosilicate ion exchange material having a particle size diameter from about 0.1 micron to about 100 microns a calcium ion exchange capacity on an anhydrous basis of at least about 200 milligrams equivalent of CaCO3 hardness per gram and a calcium ion exchange rate on an anhydrous basis of at least about 2 grains gallon minute gram. These synthetic aluminosilicates are more fully described in British Patent No. 1,429,143. For nominally unbuilt compositions, it is contemplated that compositions can contain minor amounts, i.e. up to about 10 , of compounds that3 while commonly classified as detergent builders3 are used primarily for purposes other than reducing free hardness ions for example electrolytes used to buffer pH, add ionic strength, control viscosity, prevent gelling, etc. It is to be understood that the detergent bleach composit ions of the present invention can contain other components commonly used in detergent compositions. Soil suspending agents such as water soluble salts of carboxymethylcellulose, carboxyhydroxymethylcellulose, copolymers of maleic anhydride and vinyl ethers, and polyethylene glycols having a molecular weigth of about 400 to 10,000 are common components of the detergent compositions of the present invention and can be used at levels of about 0.5 to about 10 by weigth. Dyes, pigments, optical brighteners, perfumes, enzymes, anticaking agents, suds control agents and fillers can be added in varying amounts as desired. Peroxygen bleaches such as sodium perborate can optionally be used in the compositions of this invention they are however effective only at relatively high temperatures such as approximately 1600F. and above. In conjunction therewith, conventional chemical activators can be used to bleach more effectively at low temperatures, such as the anhydrides, esters and amides disclosed by Gilbert inDetergent Age, June 1967 pages 18 20, July 1967 pages 3033, and August 1967 pages 26 27 and 67. It is generally believed that these activators function by means of a chemical reaction that requires usage in approximately a 1 1 mol ratio wlth the peroxygen compound. It should be understood that, as described in detail hereinbefore, the instant photoactivators do not function by activating perborate dr other peroxygen compounds the mechanism by which the instant photoactivators accomplish their purpose is by activating atmospheric oxygen. Neverthe less, formulations are not precluded that contain components which bleach by two different mechanisms operating independently. Granular formulations embodying the compositions of the present invention may be formed by any of the conventional techniques i.e., by slurrying the individual components in water and then atomizing and spray drying the resultant mixture, or by pan or drum granulation of the components. A preferred method of spräy drying compositions in granule form is disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,629,951 and 3,629,955 issued to Davis et awl on December 28, 1971. Liquid detergents embodying the photoactivating compositions of the present invention can contain builders or can be unbuilt. If unbuilt, they can contain about 10 to about 50 surfactant, from 1 to about 15 of an organic base such as mono , di , or tri alkanolamine, and a solu bilization system containing various mixtures of water, lower alcohols and glycols, and hydrotropes. Built liquid single phase compositions can contain about 10 to about 25 surfactant, from about 10 to about 20g builder which can be inorganic or organic, about 3 to about 10 hydrotrope, and water. Built liquid compositions in multi phase heterogeneous form can contain comparable amounts of surfactant and builder together with viscosity modifiers and stabilizers to maintain stable emulsions or suspensions. The compositions of the present invention can also be prepared in the form of a laundry bar or can be impregnated into a water insoluble substrate. Detergent bleach formulations embodying the compositions of the present invention are commonly used in laundry practice at concentrations from about 0.1 to about 0.6 wt. in water. Within these approximate ranges are variations in typical usage from household to household and from country to country, depending on washing conditions such as the ratio of fabric to water, degree of soiling of the fabrics, temperature and hardness of the water, method of washing whether by hand or by machine, specific formulation employed, etc. It has been stated hereinbefore that photoactivator usage is from about 0.005Z to about 0.5 by weight based on the detergent bleach composition, preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.1 . Combining those figures with the foregoing detergent bleach concentrations in water yields the result that photoactivator concentrations in water range from about 0.05 parts per million ppm to about 30 ppm. Within th s range, from about 0.25 to about 5 ppm. are preferred. The lower side of the foregoing ranges are especially effective when the laundry process involves exposing fabric to photoactivator for a relatively long time, as for example during a 30 to 120 minute presoak followed by a 20 to 30 minute wash, and drying the fabric in brilliant sunlight.The higher side of the foregoing ranges are needed when the laundry process involves exposing fabric to photoactivator for a relatively short time, as for example during a short 10 minute wash followed by drying in an illuminated dryer, on a line indoors, or outdoors on a cloudy day . While exposure to oxygen and visible light are essential, the source, intensity and duration of exposure of the light affect merely the degree of blacr ing achieved. EX 9MPLE I Tetrabenzo triaza porphine was prepared as follows a solution of methyl magnesium iodide was prepared from 2.4 gm. of magnesium and 6.5 ml. of methyl iodide in 100 ml. of ether this was decanted from the residual metal and added to a mixture of 12.8 gm. of finely powdered phthalonitrile and 50 ml. of ether. Upon addition, the liquid at once turned reddish brown, the nitrile dissolving, the ether gently boiling, and a tarry mass forming. After three hours at room temperature, the remainder of the ether was removed on a steam bath and the tarry residue was rapidly heated to 200 C. Three ml. of H20 were added dropwise, liberating first white fumes and then iodine vapor.After a further 1 2 hour at 2000C, the powdery residue was cooled, crushed and repeatedly extracted with a mixture of alcohol and 10 concentrated hydrochloric acid until the extract was no longer brown in color. The residue was then washed with 500 ml.of absolute ethanol and dried in an oven at 1050C for one hour. The product was freed from magnesium by dissolving it in concentrated sulfuric acid 150 ml. , followed by filtration and precipitation of the pigment with ice. The green precipitate was then collected on a filter and was washed with hot water containing 5 ammonium hydroxide. It was then dried at 1050C and crystallized from chloronaphthalene. Yield was 4.2 gm. of tetrabenzo triaza porphine in the form of purple needle like crystals. Elemental analysis of the product yielded the following results C H N C33H19N7 requires 77.2 3.7 19.1 found 77.3 3.6 19.3 A quantitative examination of the spectrum of the pigment in chloronaphthalene, using a Cary 14 spectrometer, gave the following results Wave length X nm 694 652 638 622 592 570Extinction ccef. log. 5.19 5.03 4.75 4.66 4.43 4.03The foregoing method of preparation is similar to that described in Barrett et al., J. Chem. Society, pages 18091820, and the spectrum reported above is identical to that found by Barrett. Tetrabenzo triaza porphine was metallated to tetrabenzo triaza porphine zinc by the following process 200ml. of reagent grane N,N dimethylformamide was brought to reflux in a 2.1 flask on a stirring hot plate. Tetrabenzo triaza porphine 2gm. was then added, 1 minute allowed for complete solution to occur, and then a 108 excess of the stoichiometric amount of zinc acetate was added .86 gm. and reaction was allowed to proceed under reflux for one hour. The reaction vessel was then removed from the hot plate and cooled in an ice water bath for 15 minutes. 90 ml. of chilled distilled water was then added, and thE. resulting partially crystalline precipitate was filterel, washed with water, and air dried.The product was then recrystallized from chloro naphthalene. Yield was 1.9 gm. in the form of purplish crystals. Sulfonation of tetrabenzo triaza porphine zinc led to the compound tetrasulfobenzo triaza porphine, tetrasodium salt, with demetallation occurring simultaneously One gram of tetrabenzo triaza porphine zinc and 20 ml. of concentrated H2 SO4 were ground into a homogeneous paste with a mortar and pestle. The paste was then transferred to a 250 ml. beaker and 50 additional ml. of concentrated H2 504 were admixed. The mixture was then heated on a steam bath for 4 hours, removed and allowed to stand at room temperature for 48 hours, and filtered to remove unreacted pigment. The filtrate was then diluted with two volumes ofH20 to precipitate the bright gree HSO4 salt of the sulfonated material, which was filtered and washed with acetone and then dissolved in alkaline methanol 5 NaOH in CH30H . The sulfonated porphine was then precipitated as the sodium salt by addition of 3 volumes of acetone. After the product was then dried, it was extracted with hot methanol to removeNa2SO4 residues. After extraction, the porphine was dissolved in H2O, acidified to pH 3, and passed through the H form of the cation exchange resin Dowex 50W X8 50 100 mesh to remove ionic zinc. Pure tetrasulfobenzo triaza porphine in the form of a fine green power was then isolated from a pH 5 solution by the addition of four volumes of acetone. Tetrasulfobenzo triaza porphine, tetrasodium salt, was evaluated as a photoactive bleach in conjunction with a granular detergent having the following composition which has a pH at use concentration in water of about 10.2.

Yield was 2.5 gm. of tetra 4 sulfophenyl porphine tetraammonium salt.Confirmation that the porphine was tetrasulfonated was obtained through the chromatographic technique described above. Confirmation that the sulfonations took place in the 4 position was done by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the nmr specturm of the sulfonated compound in D20 shows an abdorption due to the pyrrole protons at T 2.19 referred to a 3 trimethilsylyl propane sulfonic acid reference, and two doublets due to the phenyl protons centered atT 2.79 and 1.81 with a coupling beteeen them of 8 cps. The integrated area of the phenyl protons to pyrrole protons gave the expected 2 1 ratio. Further confirmation of the purity of the material was done by spectral analysis on a Cary 14 spectrometer nm 411 515 552 580 633 Loge 4.72 3.21 2.82 2.79 2.57The foregoing method of preparation is similar to that described in Fleisher, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 93, 3162 1971 , and the spectrum reported above agrees very well with that found by Fleisher. Metallation was accomplished in a manner similar to that described in Example I. One gram of tetra 4 sulfophenyl porphine, tetraammonium salt was reacted with a 10 excess of zinc acetate in refluxing dimethyl formamide for one hour. However isolation of the product was accomplished by a different procedure. After completion of the reaction, the solvent was removed on a rotavaporator to obtain a resin due. This residue was dissolved in water, acidified to pH3, and passed through the H form of the cation exchange resinDowex 50W X8 50 100 mesh to remove the excess ionic zinc.As the solution passed through the resin, it was immediately neutralized with sodium hydroxide to avoid decomposition of the acidic compound to zinc and the unmetallated porphine sulfonate. Yield was 0.96g. tetra 4 sulfophenyl porphine tetrasodium salt. Spectral analysis yielded the following results nm 517 557 595 630 Log s 2.88 3.28 2.84 1.81 Analysis of the zinc content by atomic absorption yielded 6.47 zinc vs. 6.50 theoretical on the basis of the empirical formula C44H28N454014ZnNa4 which includes 2 moles of water of hydration. Tetra 4 sulfophenyl porphine, tetraammonium salt and its metallated derivative tetra 4 sulfophenyl porphine zinc, tetrasodium salt were utilised in compositions analogous to that described in Example I were run on both tetra 4 sulfophenyl porphine, tetraammonium salt and its metallated derivative tetra 4 sulfophenyl porphine zinc, tetrasodium salt.
