# Cannula needle for catheter.

## Abstract
A cannula needle for a catheter is provided from flat metal sheet blank stock. A groove 15 of controlled depth is formed on the metal sheet which is then rolled to produce a hollow barrel having a slit 14 parallel to the longitudinal axis the barrel is then cut into individual needle segments. Gripping wings 17, 18 are then welded to each needle segment on either side of the slit in a separate operation. In use when the wings are flexed, the needle will split in half along the groove. This enables the cannula to be separated from the catheter.
