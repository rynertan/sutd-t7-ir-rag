# Method and apparatus of assessing the dynamic surface potential of a solution.

## Abstract
A steady stream 60 of the solution is formed, and the surface potential at a free surface of the stream of solution is measured by means of a rotary electrode 27 that rotates in close vicinity of, but separated from, the free surface of the solution, and that is mounted within an electrically grounded chamber 31 . The method permits the measuring electrode to be located very close to the surface of the liquid stream while yet avoiding vapour condensation. The method is particularly suited for determining the dynamic surface potential of liquid photographic coating compositions that are coated according to modern multilayer coating methods such as bead coating and curtain coating.
