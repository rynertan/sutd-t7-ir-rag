# Parallel series error correction circuit.

## Abstract
In a data processing system, an error correcting circuit 302 is connected in a bridging mode parallel to the data bus RDB which interconnects a processor 301 and a memory 303 . While in this mode the error correction circuit 302 does not delay the transmission of the memory words, but simply monitors the data. If an error in the data is detected, an error signal is generated on the next processor microcycle, the processor 301 aborts its present operation and then fetches the corrected data from the error correction circuit 302 . If the frequency of errors increase or if a permanent error is detected, the error correction circuit 302 switches to an in line mode series thus causing a delay in the transmission of each memory word until the error check is complete.
