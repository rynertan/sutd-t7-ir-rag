BENZANTHRIN COMPOUNDSTechnical Field This invention relates to new antibiotic and cytotoxic agents and a process for making the same.Background Art and Disclosure of the Invention Numerous antibiotics in the prior art, which exhibit activity against a broad spectrum ofGram positive bacteria, have been produced from species of microorganisms which have been isolated from soil samples throughout the world. Such antibiotics continue to be in demand. Further, cytotoxic compounds are in demand, particularly anti cancer compounds. The new compounds of the present invention have been named benzanthrin. They are believed to be of the following chemical structure EMI1.1 wherein R isEMI1.2 The benzanthrins exhibit antibacterial activity against various Gram positive bacteria and cytotoxic activity. The benzanthrins are produced by a microorganism belonging to the genus Nocardia in yields of about 3 mcg ml. These benzanthrins are produced by growing the culture in a nutrient medium. Thereafter, once isolated from the culture medium by solvent extraction with a water immiscible organic solvent followed by chromatography, the compounds of the invention are in substantially pure form.Brief Description of the Drawings FIGURE 1 illustrates the infrared absorption spectra of benzanthrins n and B in chloroform.

This strain has been deposited in the Agricultural Research ServiceCulture Collection at Northern Regional Research Center, 1815 North University Street, Peoria, Illinois 61604 and has been given the accession number NRRL 15820. I. Morpholoav and Culture Characteristics Nocardia lurida B7 is a single clone isolated as a phage resistant variant of Nocardia lurida NRRL 2430. Nocardia lurida NRRL 2430 is described by Philip and Schenck in U.S. Patent No. 2,990,329 issued June 27, 1961, and by Pridham and Lyons, Deuelopments inIndustrial Microbiology, Vol. 10, p. 208 1969 . N.lurida grows with intertwined, branched mycelium which is non septate initially but segments in 48 hours and is completely fragmented by 72 to 96 hours. The fragments are smooth walled, rod shaped, 0.8 to 1.5 microns in length with well defined ends. The mycelium is approximately 0.5 micron in diameter. The aerial mycelium is white. The vegetative mycelium is a light golden orange color and is heavily crinkled on agar surfaces. N. lurida utilizes glucose, xylose, arabinose, fructose, galactose, D mannitol and salicin.It is unable to grow when Rhamnose, sucrose, raffinose, starch or inositol are the sole carbon source. N.lurida contains the meso form of diaminopimelic acid.The major sugars in whole cell hydrolysates are arabinose and galactose. N. lurida is not acid fast and does not contain mycolic acids.II. Fermentation Cultivation of strain B 7 for the production of benzanthrins is carried out in liquid media. An assimilable carbon source such as glucose is used in combination witch an organic nitrogen source such as peptone, lactalbumin, spray dried lard water, NZ amine, pepticase, soytone plus yeast extract or whole yeast and sodium chloride.
