# Magnetic head arm assembly.

## Abstract
A magnetic head arm assembly comprises a lightweight, low inertia frustoconical arm 10 to which a magnetic head 12 is mounted at one end. The other end of the head arm is coupled to an end of a rotatable shaft 14 , by which the arm can be pivoted. An electrical coil 16 which is disposed within a magnetic field supplied by permanent magnets 20,22 is fastened to the other end of the shaft 14 . The pivotable magnetic head arm assembly may be vertically adjusted to control flying height and angularly adjusted relative to the surface of a magnetic disk to correct for azimuth variations.
