## Description
Production of Protein This invention relates to a method for production of protein. The presence of a variety of physiologically active proteins such as cytokines and peptide hormones has been ascertained and recent advances in genetic englneering technology are openg ways for large scalsv production of these physiologically active proteins and clinical application of the same. Interleukin 2 hereinafter referred to as IL 2 also called T cell growth factor TCGF 1 is a lymphokine produced by T cells upon stimulation by a lectin or alloantigen, among others Science, 193, 1007 1976 1. A large number of clones of killer T cells or helper T cells and, further, natural killer cells have so far been obtained through the utilization of IL 2 e.g. Nature, 268, 154 1977 1. In addition to such direct use in cloning T cells or natural killer cells, the use of IL 2 can result in selective in vitro proliferation of antigen specific killer T cells capable of recognizing and destroying a certain particular antigen, for example a tumor antigen. By introducing into animals tumor specific killer T cells grown in this manner, it is possible to control or inhibit tumor growth The Journal of Immunology, 125, 1904 1980 . These experimental findings suggest the possible utility of IL 2 as an antitumor agent. It is further known that IL 2 restores the helper T cell function in nude mice which are deficient in thymus functions European Journal of Immunology, 10, 719 1980 and restores the induction of killer T cells against allogenic cells Nature, 284, 278 1980 , and thereforeIL 2 can be expected to be useful in the treatment of immunocompromised diseases. Interferon a hereinafter referred to as IFN a and interferon y hereinafter referred to as IFN y are lymphokines produced by virus or nucleic acid activated lymphocytes, are biologically active in that they act on cells and bring them into an antiviral state, and thus play an important role in the phylactic system or oncoimmune system. Such proteins as these cytokines can be obtrined as naturally occurring substances but in very limited amounts. However, recent advances in recombinant DNA technology have opened the way for the recovery of biologically active proteins from cultures of those strains of Escherichia coli and so forth which respectively carry expression vectors with genes for said proteins inserted therein for IL 2 Nature, 302, 305 1983 and Nucleic Acids Research, 11, 4307 1983 forIFN a journal of Interferon Research, 1, 381 1981 for IFN y Nature, 295, 503 1982 . Since, whether it takes place in a eukaryote or in a prokaryote, protein biosynthesis starts with the messenger RNA codon AUG which corresponds to methionine, it is possible that the product protein may possibly be either a molecular species having a methionine residue at the N terminal of a molecular species having no such residue or a mixture of the two. In fact, it is known, for instance, that in Escherichia coli, the terminal of many cell proteins is methionine Conn Stumpf Outlines of Biochemistry, 4th edition, John Wiley Sons 1976 and that the initiation factor IF 3 ofEscherichia coli comprises both the molecular species having a methionine residue at the N terminal and the one free of such residue Hoppe Seyler s Zeitschrift fUrPhysiologische Chemie, 354, 1415 1973 .As regards proteins produced in Escherichia coli by using recombinant DNA techniques, it is known that the percentage of addition of methionine residue to the N terminal is about 50 for IFN a Journal of Interferon Research, 1, 381 1981 and as high as 100 for human growth hormone Nature, 293, 408 1981 . However, no instances have so far been reported of the control of the methionine residue addition percentage in such proteins. In the course of their investigations concerning the poces for producing the IL 2 protein using strains of Escherichia coli with the IL 2 gene introduced therein, the present inventors found that the IL 2 protein produced in Escherichia coli is comprised of two molecular species, namely N terminal methionine residuefree IL 2, that is a molecular species beginning with an alanine residue as the N terminal amino acid Ala IL 2 , and a molecular species having a methionine residue added to the N terminal and thus beginning with a methionyl alanine residue Met Ala IL 2 , the content of the latter being much higher than that of the former. Similarly, it was found for IFN a and IFN y produced in Escherichia coli that each is a mixture of a molecular species the N terminal of which begins with a cysteine residue Cys IFN a and Cys IFN y, respectively and a molecular species having a methionine residue added to the N terminal and thus beginning with a methionyl cysteine residue Met Cys IFN and Met CysIFN y, respectively , the latter accounting for 5 50 . Those proteins which have a methionine residue at the N terminal are supposed to be similar in biological activity to the corresponding proteins of the naturally occurring type but, at any rate, are substances different from the latter. Therefore, the known methods are not fully satisfactory in producing proteins having the respective amino acid sequences of the naturally occurring type. The present invention provides an improvement in a method for producing a protein by cultivating Escherichia coli having an expression vector which contains a structural gene for the protein downstream from the translational start codon, which comprises cultivating the Escherichia coli in a medium containing 1 an iron ion source, manganese ion source or a mixture thereof and 2 a nitroqen source from natural origin to increase the yield of. the protein free of methionine cDrresponding to the translational start codon ATG at the N terminus. As the above mentioned protein, there may be mentioned a variety of physiologically active proteins, for example cytokines such as interferons e.g. IFN a, IFN B, IFN y , interleukins e.g. interleukin l, IL 2 ,B cell growth factor BGF , B cell differentiation factor BDF , macrophage activating factor MAF , lymphotoxin LT and tumor necrosis factor TNF transforming growth factor TGF a peptide protein hormones such as erythropoietin, epidermal growth factor, insulin and human growth hormone pathogenic microbial antigen proteins such as hepatitis B virus antigen, influenza virus antigen, foot and mouth disease virus antigen and malarial parasite antigen enzymes such as peptidases e.g. tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, serratiopeptidase and lysozyme and serum proteins such as human serum albumin HSA . The method of the present invention may be applied with advantage to those instances in which IL 2, IFN a and IFN y, among others, are produced by cultivating certain strains of Escherichia coli. The term IL 2 as used herein refers to any species having the same biological or immunological activities as natural human IL 2 has, for example theIL 2 receptor binding or anti IL 2 antibody binding ability. Thus, for example, such species may be a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown inFig. 1 polypeptide I or a fragment thereof comprising some or other part of the amino acid sequence as required for the biological or immunological activities of polypeptide I , such as a fragment of polypeptide I which is lacking one amino acid EPC laid open No.91539 or 4 amino acids Japanese Patent Application No.58 235638, filed on December 13, 1983 and laid open under Japanese Patent Publication No 126088 1985 from the N terminal thereof or a fragment of polypeptide I which is lacking in several amino acids of the C terminal portion thereof. Furthermore, such species may be a polypeptide which is otherwise the same as the above polypeptide I but is lacking in part of the constituent amino acids of polypeptide I or containing one or more amino acids other than the amino acid or acids originally occurring in polypeptide I , such as a polypeptide I analog which contains a serine residue in lieu of the No. 125 cysteine residue Japanese PatentPublication laid open No. 93093 1984 . The polypeptides mentioned above are preferably in the unglycosylated form. The term IFN a as used herein refers to any species having the same biological or immunological activities as natural human IFN a has, for example theIFN a receptor binding or anti IFN a antibody binding ability. An example is a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in Fig. 3 polypeptide II . Furthermore, said species may be a fragment having a partial amino acid sequence as required for the biological or immunological activities of IFN a, such as a fragment of polypeptide II which is lacking in several amino acids of the N terminal portion thereof or in several amino acids of the C terminal portion thereof. It may further be a polypeptide which is otherwise the same as the above polypeptide II but is lacking in part of the constituent amino acids of polypeptide II or containing one or more amino acids other than the amino acid or acids originally occurring in polypeptide II . Particularly preferred among them is IFN aA. The term IFN y as used herein refers to any species having the same biological or immunological activities as natural human IFN y hes, for exam 6 theIFN y receptor binding or anti IFN y antibody binding ability. Examples are the polypeptide III shown inFig. 4 which comprises 146 amino acids and various fragments of polypeptide III . Specific examples of such fragments are an N terminal lacking molecular species which is lacking in up to 4 amino acids of theN terminal portion of polypeptide III and a C terminal lacking molecular species resulting from cleavage of polypeptide III or a corresponding N terminal lacking molecular species at a site not preceding the 131st amino acid residue.Furthermore, the above mentioned IFN y may be an analog thereof which contains a serine or threonine residue in place of a cysteine residue in the above polypeptide. Among others, polypeptide III is preferred. The protein encoding structural gene may be anyDNA, either nature derived or synthetic, which codes for the amino acid sequence of the above protein. Thus, for instance, there may be mentioned, for IL 2, a DNA having the base sequence shown in Fig. 2 DNA IV which codes for the amino acid sequence shown in Fig. 1 for IFN a, a DNA DNA V e.g. JapanesePatent Publication laid open No. 79897 1982 coding for the amino acid sequence IFN aA shown in Fig. 3 and, for IFN y, a DNA DNA VI e.g. Japanese PatentPublication laid open No. 189197 coding for the amino acid sequence shown in Fig. 4. The above mentioned structural gene DNA exists downstream from the translation start codon ATG. Said gene may be present downstream from ATG either in direct connection therewith or via a spacer incapable of being expressed or some other structural gene occurring between ATG and said gene. It is particularly preferable that ATG and the structural gene are directly cJnnested with each other. It is preferable that the above mentioned gene DNA has a promoter upstream therefrom. Said promoter may be any of the APL or BPR promoter which takes part in the growth of Btphage, the tryptophan trp promoter, the lactose lac promoter, the protein chain elongation factor Tu tuf B promoter and the rec A promoter, among others. In particular, the APL and trp promoters may be used in the practice of the present invention with advantage. The above gene and promoter are generally inserted into a vector to give an expression vector. As the plasmid for producing said vector, there is used most frequently ColEl derived pBR322 Gene, 2, 95 1977 , for instance, but any other plasmids capable of being maintained by replication in Escherichia coli may also be used. Examples are pBR313 Gene, 2, 75 1977 3, pBR324 and pBR 325 Gene, 4, 121 1978 , pBR327 and pBR328 Gene, 9, 287 1980 , pKY2289 Gene, 3, 1 1978 , pKY2700 tseikagaku Biochemistry , 52, 770 1980 1, pACYC177 and pACYC184 Journal of Bacteriology, 134, 1141 1978 , and pRK248, pRK646 and pDF41 Methods inEnzymology, 68, 268 1979 . Bacteriophage derived vectors, for example 1 phage derived lgt series vectors such as Agt AC Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 71, 4579 1974 , AgtAB ibid., 72, 3416 1975 and XDam Gene, 1, 255 1977 , Charon vectors Science, 196, 161 1977 Journal of Virology, 29, 555 1979 , and filamentous phage derived vectors may also be used as expression vectors. The above mentioned expression vector may be constructed by an appropriate known method e.g. Nature, 302, 305 1983 Nucleic Acids Research, 11, 4307 1983 Japanese Patent Publication laid open No. 7o8 7 1987 Japanese Patent Publication laid open No.18197 1983 . As the host into which the expression plasmid with a structural gene for a protein inserted therein is to be introduced, a strain of Escherichia coli is used and an Escherichia coli K 12 derived strain is particularly preferred from the handling and safety viewpoints. Examples of said Escherichia coli K 12 derived strain which are used with advantage are the strains 294, RR 1, DH 1, N4830 and C 4. The strain 294 is a known strain Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 73, 4174 1976 and has been deposited with the Institute forFermentation, Osaka IFO under the deposit No.IFO 14171. The strain RR 1 is described in Gene, 2, 75 1977 , the strain DH 1 in Nature, 217, 1110 1968 , and the strain N4830 in Cell, 25, 713 1981 . Having the temperature sensitive cI represser in the host, the strain N4830 is especially useful when APL is used as the expression promoter, and it is available fromPharmacia P L Biochemicals. The strain C 4 is deposited at IFO under IFO 14421 and at FRI under FERM BP 966, respectively. The Escherichia coli strain to be used in the practice of the present invention may be produced by transforming a host Escherichia coli strain with an expression vector containing the structural gene for a protein and the transformation may be effected by the means described, for example, in Journal of MolecularBiology, 53, 159 1970 , Methods in Enzymology, 68 253 1979 , Gene, 3, 279 1978 , and Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences USA, 69, 2110 1972 In accordance with the present invention, the above Escherichia coli strain is cultivated in a medium supplemented with an iron ion source and or a manganese ion source. Referring to the iron ion source and manganese ion source to be added tc the medium, the iron ion source means a substance capable of supplying iron ions when it is dissolved or a substance capable of being utilized in the form of iron ions. Iron salts are examples.Preferred are inorganic salts of divalent or trivalent iron e g. ferrous chloride, ferric chloride, ferrous sulfate, ferric sulfate, ferric phosphate, ferric nitrate , among which mineral acid salts of trivalent iron e.g. ferric chloride, ferric sulfate are most preferred. The manganese ion source means a substance capable of giving manganese ions upon dissolution or a substance capable of being utilized in the form of manganese ions.Examples of such substance are manganese salts, preferably inorganic salts of manganese e.g. manganese sulfate, manganese chloride, manganese carbonate, manganese phosphate , most preferably mineral acid salts of manganese e.g. manganese sulfate, manganese chloride . The iron ion source and manganese ion source are used either alone or in combination. They are preferably added in the form of aqueous solutions. The iron ion source and manganese ion source are each added to a concentration of 10 6 to 10 3 moles, preferably 2 x 10 5 to 5 x 10 4 moles, per liter. When used combinedly, they are added each to a concentration within the above range. The medium supplemented with nitrogen sources of natural origin which is to be used for cultivating the above Escherichia coli strain is a medium prepared by supplementing a known basal medium with a nitrogen source obtained from a naturally occurring substance, such as casamino acids, peptone, yeast extract or malt extract. The nitrogen source is usually supplemented in a concentration from 1 g to 50 g l. A few examples of such a medium which are suited for the practice of the present invention are given in Table 1. Table 1 Examples of medium suited for use constituent Modified M 9 medium M 33 medium M 03 mediumGlucose 10 g l 10 g l 10 g lNa2HPO4 6 g l 3 g PKH2PO4 3 g l 3 g l 3 g e NaCl 0.5 g S 0.5 g l 0.5 g I NH4C1 1 g m 1 g 1 gel MgSO4.7H2O 0.34 g S 0.34 g l 0.34 g e Casamino acids 10 g 10 g 10 g The method of the present invention may be conducted under acidic conditions, especially inEscherichia coli harboring an expression plasmid and having a trp promoter, such that Escherichia coli is inoculated into a medium of pH 4.8 to 6.0 and cultured while maintaining the range. A pH range of 5.0 to 5.8 is more recommended a pH value of approx. 5.5 is particularly conductive to culturing. After sufficient growth, however, culture conditions may be shifted out of this pH range, e.g. to more acidic conditions. The pH is adjusted usinq an inorganic base or a mineral acid before or after the medium is prepared and sterilized. pH adjustment may be required during E.coli cultivation to maintain the pH within the specified range. Since pH usually decreases during culture, the pH is adjusted by adding an inorganic base, e.g. ammonia, sodium hydroxide, and sodium carbonate however, mineral acids such as sulfuric acid may be added, if desired.Of these substances, ammonia water is especially preferable as it constitutes a nitrogen source for the media. For transformants harboring an expression plasmid and having a trp promoter, for instance, is utilized, an agent for causing the promoter to function efficiently, for example 3 B indoly acrylic acids, may be added. In the case where the host is an auxotroph, the amino acid or amino acids required e.g. L lysine, L arginine,L methionine, L leucine, L proline, L isoleucine,L valine, L tryptophan are preferably added each to a concentration of about 10 to 1,000 mg liter. It is also possible to additionally supplement glucose, casamino acids and other components during cultivation as necessary.Furthermore, for selective growth of the recombinantEscherichia coli strain, an agent to which the strain is resistant, for example tetracycline, may be added depending on the gene for drug resistance or the like retained in the plasmid. The iron ion source or manganese ion source mentioned above is added to the medium for large scale cultivation generally in advance to an appropriate concentration. Such an ion source may also be added to the seed culture medium. The cultivation is carried out generally at 15 450C. In strains carrying the XPR or APL promoter and the temperature sensitive repressor, for instance, proliferation at 25 350C followed by shifting up to about 420C is advantageous for gene expression. In strains carrying other promoters, high productivity may be attained by maintaining a temperature of about 370C from the beginning of growth to about the middle thereof and then decreasing the temperature with proliferation, followed by maintenance at 20 30 C. The cultivation is generally performed with aeration and stirring. Cultivation while maintaining the oxygen concentration in the medium at a level of not lower than about 5 v v of the saturated oxygen concentration is advantageous since, in that case, an increased yield of the desired protein may be obtained. The protein thus produced may be assayed by a known method. For assaying IL 2, for instance, an IL 2 dependent cell line may be used. Since human IL 2 is known to promote the growth of rat, mouse and some other IL 2dependent cell lines as well as human cell lines Immunological Reviews, 51, 257 1980 , not only humanIL 2 dependent cell lines but also rat or mouseIL 2 dependent cell lines may be used Journal ofImmunology, 130, 981 and 988 1983 . In particular, IL 2 dependent murine cell lines may be maintained stably by passage for a long period of time and give assay results with high reproducibility. The total IL 2 yield data given in this specification are data as measured by the method which usesIL 2 dependent cells and takes the uptake of radioactive thymidine as an index Biochemical and BiophysicalResearch Communications, 109, 363 1982 . The yield of Ala IL 2 was determined by extractingIL 2 from cells with 7 M guanidine hydrochloride, dialyzing the extract, subjecting the dialyzate to FPLC fast protein liquid chromatography to be mentioned later herein for separation of an Ala IL 2 fraction and a Met Ala IL 2 fraction, determining IL 2 activities of both fractions by the method mentioned above, calculating the proportion of Ala IL 2 and multiplying the total yield of IL 2 by this proportion. Purified samples were quantified based on the ratio between absorbance values measured at 280 nm for the proteins isolated by FPLC. IFNs are assayed either by the antiviral assay method Journal of Virology, 37, 755 1981 or by the enzyme immunoassay method Journal of Immunology, 80, 55 1985 . The proportion of the IFN species havingN terminal methionine relative to the whole IFN produced is determined by subjecting the IFN protein extracted from cells and purified by appropriate methods, for examples a purified sample of IFN zA, to FPLC to thereby separate the molecular species having N terminal methionine and the molecular species without N terminal methionine, followed by calculation based on the ratio therebetween in absorbance at 280 nm. In the case ofIFN y, both species are quantified by determining theN terminal methionine content by the dansylation method or by using a peptidesequencer. In extracting from cultured cells the protein produced in accordance with the present invention, cells after cultivation are harvested and suspended in a buffer containing a protein denaturing agent such as guanidine hydrochloride and, after stirring in a cool place, a supernatant containing the protein is collected by centrifugation. In accordance with another method, cells are suspended in a buffer and disrupted by sonication, lysozyme treatment and or freezing and thawing, and then a supernatant containing the protein is collected by centrifugation. Any other appropriate methods may also be used. The protein may be isolated from the abovementioned supernatant and purified by an appropriate combination of per se known methods of separation and purification. Examples of such known separation and purification methods are methods making good use of solubility differences, such as salting out and solvent precipitation methods mainly utilizing molecular weight differences, such as dialysis, ultrafiltration, gel filtration and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis methods making use of electric charge differences, such as ion exchange chromatography methods based on specific affinity, such as affinity chromatography methods based on hydrophobicity differences, such as reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and methods utilizing isoelectric point differences, such as isoelectric focusing.In particular, the humanIL 2 protein, which has high hydrophobicity, may be purified very effectively by hydrophobic column chromatography, in particular by high performance liquid chromatography using a reversed phase type column. ForIFN a and IFN y, the method of purification which uses monoclonal antibodies capable of specifically binding to the respective IFN species is very effective. When the above IL 2 protein is a mixture ofAla IL 2 and Met Ala IL 2, Ala IL 2 may be isolated, as desired, by the separation means based on isoelectric point differences as disclosed by the same applicant as in the instant application of PCT JP84 00460 date of international application September 26, 1984 , for instance. As the separation means based on isoelectric point differences, there may be used any method of separating proteins differing in isoelectric point by about 0.01 0.2 from one another, for example density gradient isoelectric focusing using Ampholines, gel isoelectric focusing, constant rate electrophoresis or the like method of electrophoresing proteins in an electric field, chromatofocusing, FPLC fast protein liquid chromatography , pH gradient DEAE diethylaminoethyl and CM carboxymethyl ion exchange column chromatography or the like method of eluting proteins one by one from a column in which a pH gradient is produced, or some other per se known method, or a combination of these. The reagents and apparatus to be used in these methods of separation are all commercially available and may be readily purchased. A mixture of Cys INF a and Met Cys IFN t may also be treated, if desired, in the same manner for mutual separation of the components. The thas purified proteins free of the N terminal methionine residue corresponding to the translation start codon ATG have the same physiological activities as the corresponding known proteins, such as the corresponding naturally occurring proteins, and may be used as pharmaceuticals. The Ala IL 2 protein, like known IL 2 species, may cause selective in vitro growth of antigen specific killer T cells capable of recognizing and destroying tumor antigens, for instance, or of natural killer cells capable of killing tumors independently of experience of antigen sensitization. Since simultaneous inoculation with said IL 2 with introduction of the above killer cells into a living organism results in an increased antitumor activity of the killer cells, said protein may be used in the prevention and treatment of tumors or in the treatment of immunocompromised diseases in warm blooded animals e.g. mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, pig, horse, sheep, cattle, human . For using the above Ala IL 2 protein as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent against tumors, said protein may be administered either parenterally or orally in the form of injections or capsules, for instance, as prepared by dilution with a per se known carrier. Furthermore, it may be used either alone or in combination with killer T cells or natural killer cells grown in vitro as mentioned above. The above mentioned Ala IL 2 protein has substantially the same biological activities as known humanIL 2 isolated from nature and therefore may be used in the same manner as the latter. Since the constant for its dissociation from cellular IL 2 receptors is very small, administration of said protein in very small doses is sufficient. IFN, which has antiviral, antitumor, cell proliferation inhibiting, immunopotetiating and other activities, may be used in the treatment of viral infections and tumors, among others, in mammals e.g. human, cattle, horse, pig, mouse, rat . In using saidIFN as an antiviral, antitumor, cell proliferation inhibiting or immunopotentiating agent, for instance, said IFN is mixed with a pharmacologically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent, which is known per se, and is administered in the form of injections parenterally by intravenous or intramuscular injection, for instance. In normal humans, the daily dose ranges from about 100 thousand to 100 million units, preferably from about 1 million to 50 million units. In mammals other than human, the dose ranges 2,000 to 2 million units kg day, preferably from about 20 thousand to 1 million units kg day.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence of human IL 2. Fig. 2 shows an example of the DNA base sequence coding for human IL 2. Fig. 3 shows the amino acid sequence of human IFN tA. Fig. 4 shows the amino acid sequence of humanIFN y. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the schemes for constructing the plasmids pTFl and pTB285 described in theReference Example, respectively.Examples The following examples and reference examples illustrate the present invention in further detail. The transformants disclosed in the examples have been deposited with the Fermentation Research Institute FRI , Agency of Industrial Science and Technology,Ministry of International Trade and Industry and theInstitute. for Fermentation, Osaka IFO under the deposit numbers specified in Table 2.

For each culture broth, the frozen cells were examined for Ala IL 2 productivity.The results obtained were as shown in Table 3.

Given in terms of relative value with the productivity for the no metal ion addition case taken as 100. As is evident from Table 3, the addition of Mn and or Fe resulted in an markedly increased Ala IL 2 productivity whereas the addition of other ion sources Cu , Zn , Ca , Co did not improve the productivity to any further extent. Example 2 The Escherichia coli N4830 pTB285 strain was grown in the same manner as in Example 1 in M 33 medium supplemented with the Mn ion in different concentrations, and the results as shown in Table 4 were obtained.

The culture broth was inoculated into a 5 liter jar fermenter containing 2.5 liters of modified M 9 medium or of the same medium supplemented with 4 x 10 4 moles of FeC13v6H2O and 4 x 1 10 moles of MnSO4 4 6H20, and cultivation was started at an aeration rate of 2.5 liters minute, a stirring rate of 1,000 rpm and a temperature of 37 C. During the cultivation, when the growth reached about 500 Klett units, the temperature was altered to 300C and, when the growth reached about 1,000 Xlett units, to 250C. After 24 hours of cultivation, cells were harvested and frozen, and examined forAla IL 2 productivity by extracting IL 2 from the cells.The results obtained were as shown in Table 6.

The culture broth was inoculated, in 125 ml portions, into a 2.5 liter portion of M 33 medium containing 50 mg liter of sodium ampicillin medium A and a 2.5 liter portion of M 33 medium containing 50 mg liter of sodium ampicillin, 8 x 10 5 moles ofMnSO4 4 6H2O and 4 x 10 4 moles of FeC13 6H2O medium buzz and cultivation was started at an aeration rate of 2.5 liters minute, a stirring rate of 1,000 rpm and a temperature of 300C, the pH being maintained at 6.5 throughout cultivation with aqueous ammonia.Each time when the glucose concentration decreased to 0.5 or below, glucose and casamino acids were added each in an amount corresponding to 1 . Furthermore, when the growth reached 1,000 Klett units, the temperature was raised to 420C. After 4 hours following the temperature change, the cultivation was completed, each culture broth was centrifuged and the cells harvested were frozen at 800C and stored. A 12 g portion of the frozen cells from either culture broth was suspended homogeneously in 100 ml of an extractant pH 7.0 containing 7 M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 M Tris HCl buffer. After stirring at 40C fcr 1 hour, the suspension was centrifuged at 28,000 x g for 20 minutes to give a supernatant. Each supernatant obtained was dialyzed against 0.01 M Tris HCl buffer pH 8.5 and centrifuged at 19,000 x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant obtained was passed through a DE52 DEAE cellulose, Whatman, GreatBritain column 50 ml in volume equilibrated with 0.01M Tris HCl buffer pH 8.5 for effecting protein adsorption. By constructing a linear NaC1 concentration gradient 0 to 0.15 M NaCl, 1 liter , IL 2 was eluted to give active fractions. Each active fraction obtained in the above was concentrated to about 5 ml using a YM 5 membrane Amicon, USA and the concentrate was subjected to gel filtration using a Sephacryl S 200 Pharmacia, Sweden column 500 ml in volume equilibrated with 0.1 MTris HC1 pH 8.0 1 M NaCl buffer. Each active fraction measuring about 30 ml was concentrated to about 2.5 ml using a vM 5 membrane. The concentrate was applied to an Ultrapore RPSC Altex, USA column for adsorption, followed by high performance liquid chromatography using a trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile system as the eluent.Column, Ultrapore RPSC 4.6 x 75 mm column temperature, 300C eluent A, 0.18 trifluoroacetic acid 99.9 water eluent B, 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid 99.9 acetonitrile elution program, minute 0 68 A 32 B minute 25 55 A 45 B minute 35 45 A 55 B minute 45 30 A 70 B minute 48 100 B elution rate, 0.8 ml minute detection wavelength, 230 nm. For each culture, about 10 ml of an active fraction eluted after about 39 minutes of retention under the above conditions was collected. Each of the thus obtained liquids containing a mixture of Ala IL 2 and Met Ala IL 2 was lyophilized and the lyophilizate was dissolved in 5 ml of 0.005 M ammonium acetate buffer pH 5.0 and applied to a Mono P column for FPLC 0.5 x 20 cm, Pharmacia equilibrated with 0.025 M diethanolamine hydrochloride buffer pH 9.4 and then the protein adsorbed on the Mono P column was eluted with 1 v v Pharmalite 8 10.5 5.2 v v Polybuffer 96 hydrochloride buffer pH 8.0 . FPLC was conducted at room temperature and at a flow rate of 30 ml hour. For each culture, an active eluate fraction of from 17 ml to 19 ml was collected and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography using a trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile system as the eluent for removing Polybuffer.Column, Ultrapore RPSC 1.0 x 25 cm, Altex column temperature, eluent A and eluent B, the same as above elution program, minute 0 55 A 45 B minute 4 55 A 45 B minute 28 42 A 58 B minute 38 34 A 66 B minute 43 20 A 80 B minute 44 55 A 45 B elution rate, 3.0 ml minute. Each Ala IL 2 fraction thus obtained was lyophilized to give a white powder. The powder mentioned above as obtained from medium A without addition of any metal salts weighed 1.53 mg, whereas medium B with metal salt addition gave 6.31 mg of a powder. With these two samples, the N terminal amino acid was identified by the automatic Edman degradation method using a vapor phase protein sequencer Applied Biosystems model 470A and it was confirmed that Ala accounted for 98 or more. It was simultaneously confirmed that other protein chemistry characteristics C terminal amino acid, amino acid composition analyses, peptide mapping were quite the same.Example 6 The Escherichia coli 294 ATCC 31446 pLeIF A trp25 strain cf. Example 1 of EPC laid open No. 43980 carrying an expression p asmid with a human IFN uA gene coding for the amino acid sequence shown in Fig. 3 inserted therein was inoculated into 50 ml of a medium prepared by adding 5 mg liter of tetracycline hydrochloride to L medium, followed by overnight incubation at 370C with rotation and shaking. The culture broth was transferred to a 5 liter jar fermenter containing 2.5 liters of modified M 9 medium supplemented with one or two metal salts specified in Table 7. Cultivation was started at an aeration rate of 2.5 liters minute, a stirring rate of 1,000 rpm and a temperature of 370C.The temperature was lowered to 300C at an extent of growth of 500 Klett units and further to 250C at 1,000Klett units. Cultivation was performed for 24 hours in that manner. During cultivation, each time when the glucose concentration had become 0.28 or below, glucose was added in an amount of 1 each. After cultivation, each culture broth was centrifuged, whereby cells were harvested, which were suspended in 100 ml 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6 containing 10 sucrose, 0.2 M NaC1, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate EDTA , 10 mM spermidine, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride PMSF and 0.2 mg ml lysozyme. After stirring at 40C for 1 hour, the suspension was warmed at 370C for 5 minutes and, then, further treated in a sonicator Altex, USA at C0C for 40 seconds.The resulting lysate was centifuged at 11,300 x g for 1 hour to give 95 ml of a supernatant. This supernatant 95 ml was diluted with 300 ml of 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6 containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.15M NaCl TEN and the dilution was appljed to an antiIFN aA antibody column 20 ml . After washing the column sufficiently with TEN, IFN uA was eluted with 0.2 M acetic ..tid containing 0.1 Tween 20 Wako Pure Chemical Industri s , the active fraction collected was adjusted to pH 4.5 and applied to a CM cellulose cclumn for adsorption. Aster sufficient washing of the column, elution was effected with 0.025 M ammonium acetate buffer pH 5.0 containing 0.15 M NaCl.The active fraction thus collected again was lypophilized to give a human leucocyte IFN aA power in an amount given in the table below. Each sample thus obtained gavf a single band inSDS polyacrylamide gel electrophore is and had a molecular weight of 19,000 1,000 and an ant viral activity of 2 to 3 x 108 U mg. The sample obtai d was subjected toFPLC using a Mono P column for chr matofocusing withPolybuffer from pH 6.7 to pH 5.5, vhereby the proportions of the molecular species having a N terminal methionine and the molecular species free of such methionine were determined. The results were shown in Table 7.Thus, the addition of manganese. nd or iron ions resulted in production of IFN zA substan íally free of the N terminal methionine containing molecular species.

The culture broth was transferred to a 5 liter jar fermenter containing 2.5 liters of M 33 medium supplemented with one or two metal salts specified in Table 8. Cultivation was started at an aeration rate of 2.5 liters minute, a starting rate of 1,000 rpm and a temperature of 30 C. At the logarithmic stage, when the growth was at about 700 Klett units, glucose and casamino acids were added each in an amount corresponding to a concentration of 1 and at the same time the incubation temperature was raised from 300C to 420C, followed by 4 hours of continued cultivation.Each time when the glucose concentration had become 0.2 or below1 glucose and casamino acids were added each in an amount corresponding to a concentration of 1 . After completion of cultivation, the culture broth was centrifuged, whereby cells were collected, which were then frozen and stored. Extraction of a 100 g portion of frozen cells from each culture with 300 ml of 100 mM Tris hydrochloride buffer pH 7.0 containing 7 M guanidine hydrochloride was followed by centrifugation, giving a supernatant.This supernatant was diluted 70 fold with a buffer hereinafter referred to as P.B.S. comprising 137 mM sodium chloride, 27 mM potassium chloride, 8 mM disodium phosphate and 147 mM monopotassium phosphate and the dilution was again centrifuged to give a clear and transparent supernatant. This supernatant was applied to a monoclonal antibody y2 11.1 MoAb Japanese PatentPublication laid open No. 80646 1984 column 50 ml and, after sufficient washing, elution was carried out with 20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 2 M guanidine hydrochloride. An active fraction was collected and further applied to a Sephacryl S 200 Pharmacia column and then to a Sephadex G 25 column, the active fraction was collected in each case, whereby a purified IFN y sample was obtained. The yields from the respective media are shown in Table 8. Each sample obtained showed an IFN y purity of not less than 95 and an antiviral activity of 3 to 4 x 106 IU m, The sample was dansylated and dansyl methionine was isolated and quantified by HPLC. The proportion of the molecular species containing Nterminal methionine relative to the total molecular species was thus determined and the data obtained are shown in Table 8.

After every 6 hours1 2g of glucose and 2 g f of casamino acid were added. After 24 hours of cultivation, Ala IL 2 productivity was examined for the culture broth to obtain the result shown in Table 9. Cells were harvested from the culture broth andIL 2 was extracted from the respective 12 g of frozen cells and purified to Ala IL 2 by the same manner as described in Example 5. 2.1 mg and 10.0 mg of Ala IL 2 were obtained from the cells grown in medium 1 and in medium 2 , respectively.

The 1294 bp DNA fragment obtained was rendered blunt ended with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated with theEcoRI linker dTGCCATGAATTCATGGCA using T4 DNA ligase.The DNA obtained was digested with EcoRI to give a DNA fragment having the translation start codon ATG and the human IL 2 gene. This DNA fragment was inserted into the plasmid ptrp781 Nucleic Acids Research, 11, 3077 1983 digested in advance at the FcoRI PstI sites, using Tzc DNA ligase. The thus obtained expression plasmid pTF1 has the translation start codon and human IL 2 gene downstream from the trp promoter Fig. 5 . The plasmid pTF1 was cleaved with the restriction enzyme StuI, followed by ligation with the BamHI linker. The resulting plasmid DNA was treated with the restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI and the EcoRI BamHI fragment was inserted into the APL promoter containing plasmid pTB281. The thus obtained expression plasmid was named pTB285 Fig. 6 . ii Escherichia coli N4830 was transformed with the plasmid pTB285 obtained in the above by the method ofCohen et al.
