# FIBER OPTIC MICROSCOPE WITH ADJUSTABLE TUBE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A compact portable microscope includes an optical tube assembly which is resiliently mounted therein. Adjusting members bear against the optical tube to shift the position of the objective relative to the stage. The image of the specimen being examined may, therefore, be selectively positioned within the field of view of the microscope. The optical tube assembly is also movable axially within the housing for focussing.
