# Process for making sulfurized olefins.

## Abstract
This invention describes an improved process for prepar ing organic sulfides by 1 reacting a sulfur halide with an olefin in an olefin to sulfur halide molar ratio ranging from 1 1 to 1.65 1, 2 reacting the product thereof with an alkali metal sulfide to form a sulfurized olefin and 3 reacting the sulfur ized olefin with a separate portion of an aqueous solution comprising alkali metal sulfide such that the alkali metal sul fide is present to the extent of from 0.2 mole to 1.0 mole of sulfide per mole of the product of the sulfurized olefin.
