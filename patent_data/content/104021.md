## Description
CONTROLLING MOISTURE CONTENT OF PRILLED PRODUCTS This invention relates in general to the manufacture of prilled products e.g. prilled fertiliser products , and in particular to apparatus for and methods of controlling the moisture content of prilled products e.g.urea prills . Fertiliser manufacturing processes are known in which concentrated solution, for example a concentrated urea solution, is supplied from an evaporator to feed a prilling tower. The solution is typically at a concentration of 95 or greater and supplied to the prilling tower by spraying the solution at the top of the tower through multiple jets or distributors. Atmospheric air flow is supplied in countercurrent fashion to the spray whereby the concentrated solution is dried into the final prilled product. US Patent No. 4 219 589 to Niks et al discloses a process for urea granulation wherein the urea granules are prepared by spraying an aqueous urea solution into a fertiliser bed of urea nuclei. In this manner the aqueous urea solution coats the nuclei and crystallises thereon to form granules or prills having a desired size. This patent is directed entirely to the formation of such granules having a specific size and does not disclose any means for controlling the inlet air temperature and humidity so as to maintain a proper moisture content for the resulting urea granules or prills. US Patent No. 3 287 408 to Veltman is directed to a process for rendering urea prills free flowing and non caking. This process entails agitating a bed of urea prills and a specific contact zone and maintaining the bed at a specific temperature in order to dry the prills. Other US patents which are relevant in understanding the background of the present invention are No. 2 653 391 to Edmunds, Jr. and No. 3 261 105 to Mullen, Jr. A problem which remains in such prilled urea manufacturing processes is that a close control of moisture content in the prilled urea is not maintained. Moisture content for prilled urea is of key significance for the use of the product as fertiliser. This is because a moisture content greater than a desired product specification will result in the formation of lumps of urea prills. Consequently, efficiency in a packing operation is reduced due to clogging and the effectiveness of the fertiliser is reduced due to a reduction in surface area which is available for chemical reaction. A moisture content less than a desired product specification may result in cracks formed on the prill surface which increases surface area for water absorption during packaging, shipping etc. This ultimately reduces the effectiveness of the fertiliser. If the moisture content in the finished product is either too great or too low, the only available actions are the constant maintenance of packing operation equipment to prevent clogging, the formation of a solution of the prilled product and the re prilling thereof, or the disposal of the off specification product by selling at a lower rate or simply discarding it. The present invention provides a method and apparatus which closely controls the moisture content of prilled products for example, urea prills by controlling the flow rate of air into a vessel for example a prilling tower . According to one aspect thereof, the present invention provides apparatus for controlling the moisture content in a prilled product produced by air drying a spray of the product, which apparatus comprises a vessel for receiving a flow of air and a flow of the product, air supply means for supplying air at an air flow rate to the vessel and product supply means for supplying the product at a product flow rate to the vessel. First, second and third moisture content means provide signals corresponding respectively to the product flow moisture content, the input air moisture content and the output air moisture content.An air flow controller is connected to the air supply means for controlling the flow of air and a control circuit is connected to the controller for adjusting the air input flow rate as a function of the various moisture contents and the product flow rate. According to another aspect thereof, the present invention provides apparatus for controlling the moisture content p of a prilled product produced by air drying a spray of the product, the apparatus being characterised by a vessel for receiving a flow of air and a flow of the product air supply means for supplying air at an air flow rate Ai to the vessel product supply means for supplying the product at a product flow rate F to the vessel first moisture content means for providing a signal corresponding to a product flow moisture content Y I second moisture content means for providing a signal corresponding to an input air moisture content L i third moisture content means for providing a signal corresponding to an output air moisture content 5to , air control means connected to the air supply means for controlling the air flow rate and a control circuit connected to the first, second and third moisture content means and to the air control means, the control circuit being operable to establish an air flow rate A. needed for a selected prilled product moisture content according to the equation EMI3.1 According to a preferred form of apparatus embodying the invention and described hereinbelow, temperature and humidity values are taken at various locations in the process and are used to calculate a desired air input flow rate for a specified and desired moisture content of the produced prills.A feature of the preferred apparatus comprises means for calculating the moisture content of the input and output air as a function of the input air temperature and average temperature within the vessel e.g. prilling tower .The preferred apparatus, for controlling the moisture content of prilled products, in particular urea prills, is simple in design, rugged in construction and economical to manufacture. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of controlling the moisture content of a prilled product which is produced by air drying a spray of the product, which method comprises determining the moisture content of the product flow to a vessel e.g. a prilling tower , the moisture content of input air to the vessel and the moisture content of output air from the vessel, selecting a desired moisture content for the prilled product, and controlling the air flow rate to the prilling tower according an algorithm which is a function of the moisture contents for the product, the input and output air flows and the product flow rate. According to yet another aspect thereof, the invention provides a method of controlling the moisture content p of a prilled product produced by air drying a spray of the product in a vessel which receives a flow of air for drying the spray and a flow of the product, the method being characterised by sensing the input air flow rate into the vessel obtaining a value corresponding to a moisture content of the product aye flowing into the vessel selecting a desired moisture content p for the prilled product obtaining a value corresponding to the moisture content t i of input air to the vessel obtaining a value corresponding to a moisture content to of air leaving the vessel calculating a required input air flow rate A according to the equation EMI4.1 controlling the flow of input air to the vessel to meet the required input air flow rate A. . The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, the sole figure of which is a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment of the invention. The drawing shows apparatus for controlling moisture content of prilled products, in particular urea prills, by drying a spray of product using a flow of atmospheric air. A prilling tower or vessel 10 is supplied with atmospheric air by a blower 12 over an air line 14. The line 14 is connected to the bottom of the tower 10. A product line 16 is connected to the top of the tower 10 and, by means of a schematically shown product supply pump 20, supplies liquid product, in this case an aqueous solution of urea, to the top of the tower 10. The spray of liquid product is exposed to a countercurrent flow of drying air and dried into pellets or prills which leave the bottom of the tower 10 at a prilled product output 18. Connected to the air line 14 is an air flow valve 22 which is controlled by a controller FIC 11 to regulate the amount of drying air supplied to the tower 10. The flow of air is sensed by a flow transmitterFT 12. The flow of urea solution, which preferably has a concentration of 95 or higher and is supplied from an evaporator not shown , is sensed by a flow transmitter FT 11. The moisture content of the aqeuous urea solution product flow is determined in a hygrometer unit AY 11, which provides a constant value of the product flow moisture content. The temperature of the input air in the line 14 is monitored by a temperature sensor or thermocouple TT 14 and the average temperature within the vessel 10 is monitored by temperature averaging means 24. The temperature averaging means 24 include for example three temperature transmitters TT 11, TT 12 and TT 13 that take temperatures at various levels of the vessel 10. These temperatures are combined in a unit TY 11 and divided by three in a unit TY 12 to obtain an average value for the temperature within the vessel 10. The remaining circuitry is utilised to achieve an algorithm wherein desired moisture content of the prilled product is controlled by controlling the flow rate of input air via the valve 22. The analysis utilised to achieve the desired moisture content takes temperature and humidity quantities into account. The symbols used herein have the following meanings F feed flow rate of the urea solution product flow F F water concentration in the urea feed solution P prilled product output stream flow rate p desired concentration of water in the prilled product Ai flow rate of the inlet air Ao flow rate of the outlet or effluent air qP i moisture content of the inlet air T Q moisture content of the outlet air and Ti inlet air temperature. For overall material balance, it is assumed that F A. P A 1 I 0 and, for water balance, that F F Ai i Ao o P p 2 For urea balance it is assumed that F 1 F P 1 p 3 p From equations 1 , 2 and 3 , the following can be obtained EMI6.1 Equation 4 give the desired air flow rate for a given moisture content of the prilled product as long as all other variables can be either measured or inferred. It is difficult to measure the moisture content o of the effluent or outlet air. Nevertheless, it can safely be assumed that the maximum moisture content of the effluent air is limited to saturated air. Then 1 to p 5 where P is given by the expression log Pw 6.99 7932.6 6 T where T is the average tower temperature in K. Equation 6 can be simplified to 3.3067 3411 7 T Combining equations 5 and 6 gives nY 0 1.433T 1479 8 1479 T Similarly, 1.433T. 1479 i 9 1479 Ti From equations 4 , 8 and 9 , the flow rate of inlet air A. can be determined for a specified moisture content in the product p and measured values of the variables F, Ti, T and F. Functionally, the desired inlet air flow is given by A. KG F, p, Ti, T,F Fp I where K a multiplicative constant accounting consistency of units and G a function depending of the variables NYF p, Ti, T F p and F. An exact expression can be obtained by combining equations 4 , 8 and 9 . The drawing shows a control scheme for the prilling tower 10 based on the above analysis. The implementation shown herein is a conventional electronic instructionation and control system. Nevertheless, it can be implemented easily via a control computer system. The input air temperature from the transmitter TT 14 which is in degrees Celcius, is converted in a unit TY 45 to Kelvins by adding 273 thereto. This brings the temperature to the thermodynamic scale. The inlet air moisture content t i is provided on a line 26 after being calculated according to equation 9 in units TY 41, TY 42, TY 43 and TY 44. These units all have the functions and manipulate the values as shown in the drawing. The line 26 is connected to an element TY 18 which receives the output air moisture content value o from a line 28 and generates the 0 factor Y o ti An element TY 19 establishes the factor t and an element TY 20 divides this factor by the factor O i to form the middle factor of equation 4 . The average temperature value T. is calculated by the temperature averaging means 24 which includes an element TY 13 for converting the temperature into Kelvins and unitsTY 14, TY 15, TY 16 and TY 17 that are operable to solve equation 8 .The product flow rate F is determined from a function generator FY 12 and multiplied with the first factor of equation 4 , which is generated by means generally designated 30. The desired and thus known prill product moisture content t p is supplied over a line 32 to a subtracting unit AY 12 which subtracts the value from the moisture content value NYF for the product as detected by the hygrometer unit AY 11. The denominator of the first factor in equation 4 is established in a unit AY 13 and division is achieved in a unit AY 14. The first and last factors of equation 4 are multiplied together in a multiplication unit FY 13. A multiplication unit FY 14 multiplies the three factors of equation 4 together, as well as multiplying this value by the constant K to produce the desired air flow value A. for input air. This value is supplied over a line 34 to the controller Fl C Il which compares this desired input air value with the known value provided over the flow transmitter FT 12 and a function generator FY 15. Thus, according to the above described arrangement, the said point is chosen to be desired moisture content qY p and the control parameter is the p air input flow rate A..
