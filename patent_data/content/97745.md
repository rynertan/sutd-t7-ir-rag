# Tapered thread cutting machine.

## Abstract
A tapered thread cutting machine includes a multi part rotary machining head, one part 61 including a through recess 64 and another being a separable interior wear plate 62 . Interacting chaser holders 80,98 are mounted in the recess 64 and include angled V shaped slots 114 in which block type chasers 99,100 may be secured between clamps and locating pins 130 enabling the chasers 99,100 to be removed and replaced without removing the holders 80,98 from the recess 64 . The holders 80,98 are driven by a linear cam 77 for opening and closing movement through a thrust block 83 mounted on a guide rod 90 , such thrust block 83 being fitted in a slot 81 in one holder but otherwise not secured thereto so that binding during the opening and closing of the tool holder is minimized.
