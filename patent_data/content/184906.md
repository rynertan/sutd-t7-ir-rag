## Description
The present invention relates generally to a diagnostic aid based on immunological principles, and more specifically to monoclonal antibodies against specific antigens produced by squamous cell lung carcinoma SLC , to a method for making such antibodies and to their use in the diagnosis of SLC.Background of the Invention Cancer cells synthesize unusual and sometimes highly specific proteins and glycolipids. Sensitive methods are needed for identifying the unusual cellular compounds with high tumor specificity, because they can provide markers for early cancer detection and perhaps for advancing understanding of the process of transformation. This approach is needed for most forms of human cancer but especially for lung cancer which is now the main cause of cancer deaths in most countries of Western Europe and in North America. The malignant lung neoplasms can be subdivided into various histological types, of which the incidence of SLC constitutes about 50 60 in males. The therapeutic possibilities for squamous lung cancer have remained very limited. One of the main obstacles seems to be that only for a minor fraction of the patients is the disease still localized at the time of diagnosis. It is therefore likely that the therapeutic efficiency using current modalities can be improved by earlier diagnosis. Immunological procedures, and in particular those based on the use of monoclonal antibodies, are promising tools for early identification of malignant neoplasms. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies with reactivity to human lung cancer cells are known in the art. Most of these antibodies react with antigens that are shared by different histological types of lung cancer and also expressed by some normal differentiated cells, in normal serum, and or in other tumor types. A few antibodies have been reported to be specific for subtypes of lung cancer, such as small cell and large cell lung cancer for review, see J.L. Mullshine et al., 1985. However, in these cases the specificity analysis was restricted to a limited number of cancer cell lines or a few tumor specimens, and also the biochemical characterization of the antigens has been quite limited. So far, no report has been made of monoclonal antibodies specific for an antigen of SLC which, due to its release into the blood stream, lends itself for serological detection. Antigenic glycoproteins and glycolipids associated with various types of non lung cancer cells are known, and carbohydrate epitopes of such glycoproteins and glycolipids have been described, see, e.g., Hakomori et al., 1985. However, no such carbohydrate epitopes of glycoproteins or glycolipids released by lung cancer cells appear to have been characterized. For a discussion of cancer associated carbohydrate antigens detected by monoclonal antibodies, seeGinsburg, V. et al., 1984. Summary of the Invention It is the object of this invention to devise a method for the detection of human SLC which in its sensitivity surpasses any of the diagnostic methods known heretofore. The present invention is based on the observation that antigens elaborated by human SLC cell lines comprise a specific carbohydrate moiety and that such antigens are present in body fluids and tumor containing tissue extracts from patients with squamous lung cancer. Thus, according to one of its aspects the present invention provides an SLC associated antigen containing an epitope which is recognized by the antibody generated by the hybridoma cell line 43 9F IgM , the latter to be defined hereinafter. Preferably, the epitope is identified as a specific carbohydrate moiety elaborated by the SLC cell lineRH SLC Lll cf. fig. 1 of the Drawings , or as part of an anti idiotypic antibody which is recognized by the antibody generated by the hybridoma cell line 43 9F IgM or immunologically equivalent monoclonal antibodies. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a monoclonal antibody which binds an epitopic carbohydrate moiety specific for human squamous lung cancer, which moiety is produced by the cell line RH SLC Lll.In one preferred embodiment of the invention the monoclonal antibody is of rodent, more preferably of murine, origin. In an additional preferred embodiment the monoclonal antibody is of human origin. The invention is also directed to a process for preparing a monoclonal antibody, which process is characterized by cultivating in a growth medium a hybridoma cell line capable of generating an antibody which binds an epitopic carbohydrate moiety specific for human squamous lung cancer, which moiety is produced by the human SLC cell line RH SLCLll, followed by recovery of the monoclonal antibody from the growth medium. In preparing the monoclonal antibody of this invention, the hybridoma cell line, preferably the cell line 43 9F IgM , is grown in tissue culture or in murine ascites culture Furthermore, there is provided a diagnostic kit for the detection of human SLC in a body source, which kit comprises the monoclonal antibody of Claim 5.In preferred embodiments the diagnostic kit is adapted for dot blot analysis, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays ELISA or RadioImmuno Assay RIA .Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 shows dot blot assays using the 43 9F monoclonal antibody in analysis of extracts of different cell types. Fig. 2 shows the release of glycoproteins by RHSLC Lll cells. Fig. 3 shows the course of exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryle S200 column of glycoproteins released fromRH SLC Lll cells. Fig. 4 shows competition radioimmuno assay of the 43 9F antigen as hereinafter defined . The assay is based on competition between immobilized antigen and antigen in solution for labelled 43 9F antibodyDetailed Description The general procedures for generation of monoclonal antibodies against lung cancer cells and the methods to establish the specificity of such antibodies are known in the art Olsson et al., 1984 . A substantial number 348 of hybridomas were made by this procedure and tested for desired specificity to SLC cells. Only three of those were found to secrete immunoglobulins with a specificity of potential interest. These 3 were cloned by limiting dilution and subsequently tested for binding to 11 subclones of the RH SLCLll cell line.While no binding of any of the three monoclonal antibodies to one of the 11 SLC subclones was observed they were found to react with most subclones of a small cell lung carcinoma SCC cell line RH SCC L10. Apart from these hybridomas and not included in this set of experiments one hybridoma was found to generate a monoclonal antibody with binding to all 11 subclones of the RH SLC Lll cell line and showing no reaction with the RH SCC L10 subclones. This antibody was designated 43 9F IgM . Additional hybridoma cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies with a similar specificity for RH SLC Lll cells as described above may be generated using the same procedure. In particular soluble 43 9F antigen preparations were used for immunization and screening. For further screening and identification, competitive blocking assays with the available 43 9F antibody can be used. Other rodent strains can be used other myelomas e.g., Taggart, R.T. et al. 1983 can also be used. The 43 9F IgM hybridoma cell line has been deposited at the National Collection of Animal Cell Cultures NCACC , Salisbury, Wiltshire, England for the purpose of patent procedures on the indicated date. Deposit Date Depositors Reference NCACC Designation 14 June, 1985 Hybridoma cell line 85061402 43 9F Dot blot analysis or ELISA conducted according to the examples hereinafter provided was used to assay the antigen recognized by the 43 9F antibody. Fig. 1 of the drawings shows the result of an analysis of extracts prepared from several different cell types. The 43 9F antigen was readily detected in extracts of two cloned cell lines of different squamous lung carcinomas, whereas specific binding could not be detected in extracts from normal human cell types or other cancer cell lines. The 43 9F antigen negative cell types include those derived from other types of human lung cancer cells, from normal lung cells as well as cell lines derived from malignant neoplasms of other tissues and some other normal tissues.Faint positive reactions were occasionally seen with undiluted extracts of cell types other than squamous lung carcinomas, but these reactions were attributed to weak non specific binding of the 43 9F antibody, since they were not competed by excess of the 43 9F antibody, unlike the specific reaction. Tumor biopsies from different types of human tumors were analysed by ELISA for the presence of antigen as summarized in Table 1. The 43 9F antibody was found to be highly specific for squamous lung cancer, and although an occasional isolated specimen from other tumor types did show weak reactivity with the 43 9F antibody only squamous lung carcinomas were strongly positive.

The 43 9F Antigen Recognized by Antibody front Hybridoaa 43 9F The dilution patterns of Fig. 1 show that the amounts of antigen produced by RH SLC Lll and RH SLC L12 cell lines are not the same. Considering the protein concentrations of the two extracts, the concentration of the antigen recognized by antibody from hybridoma 43 9F hereinafter antigen 43 9F seems to be 10 30 fold larger in the RHSLC Lll cells. Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter FACS analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy on permeabilized cells, and electron microscopy have all established that the 43 9F antigen primarily is a cell surface component. The SLC cell line RH SLC Lll has been deposited at the National Collection of Animal Cell Cultures NCACC ,Salisbury, Wiltshire, England NCACC for the purpose of patent procedures on the date indicated below.Deposit Date Depositors Reference NCACC Designation 14 June, 1985 RH SLC Lll 85061403 The 43 9F antigen is released from cells in vitro.The RH SLC Lll cells may be grown in vitro, e.g. in RPMI 1640 medium without serum supplements, and released macromolecules binding the 43 9F antibody can therefore be readily prepared from the media. The antigen recognized by 43 9F antibody includes either naturally occurring glycoproteins or glycolipids. This is evidenced by the isolation of substantially purified separate fractions having protein and lipid characteristics, each of which is recognized by the 43 9F antibody. RH SLC Lll cells and cells from small cell lung carcinoma SCC RH SCC L10 were cultured attached to plastic dishes in RPMI 1640 media plus fetal calf serum FCS 7 x 104 cells per ml of medium . 3H glucosamine 2.2Ci mmole, 5.0 IlCi ml was added at zero time, 200 Eul samples were removed thereafter at the indicated times, centrifuged at 30.000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes to eliminate insolubles, andTCA insoluble 3H glycoprotein in the supernatants was determined. Fig. 2 of the drawings shows the release of 3Hglycoproteins from SLC cells upper curve and SCC cells lower curve . Dot blot analysis revealed that the 43 9F epitope is present on at least a part of the molecules released by RH SLC cells, but not on those released by the other cell line.The rate of release of the antigen and of total 3H glycoproteins was similar when the cells were grown without FCS. The total amount of 43 9F antigen solubilized withTriton from RH SLC Lll cells and also that spontaneously released into media showed broad distributions of electrophoretic mobilities. Although individual bands of apparently discrete structure were seen in both distributions, no bands were clearly resolved and the positions of major bands in the adjacent immunoblot did not correspond. Coomassie blue staining of a similar gel indicated that the major stained released protein barely entered the running gel and had a molecular weight significantly greater than the 200 kD marker. A partly resolved band at this position was also seen in the corresponding immunoblot, but many other species of smaller sizes having near continuous electrophoretic mobilities were also evident.To summarize, the immunoblot analysis suggested that the molecules recognized by the 43 9F antibody include a diverse set of primarily large glycoproteins. Furthermore, the glycoprotein antigen has been immunopurified using 43 9F antibody. The resulting product is substantially free of glycoproteins which do not contain an epitope recognized by the 43 9F antibody. This product comprises proteins of diverse molecular weight, all of which contain the 43 9F epitope as hereinafter defined . This product is part of the inventionThe 43 9F Epitope The term epitope as used in this invention is meant to include any determinant responsible for specific interaction with an antibody molecule. Epitopic determinants usually consist of surface groupings of molecules such as sugar side chains, and have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. The 43 9F glycoprotein and glycolipid antigen s will include the 43 9F epitope.However, the 43 9F epitope may be present by itself or coupled to other than the protein or lipid conjugates with which it is associated in nature. For example, the 43 9F epitope could be associated or coupled with proteins other than those it is normally coupled to in nature, with latex particles, and the like.It was demonstrated by affinity chromatography that the 43 9F epitope is present on a diverse group of glycoproteins released from RH SLC L11 cells. A wheat germ lectin column retained nearly all of the 43 9F antigen detectable by dotblot assay and the antigen could be eluted by 0.1 M N acetylglucosamine. Thus, the molecules recognized by the 43 9F antibody appear to be glycoconjugates. Part of the applied antigen was also retained on a concanavalin A column and could be eluted with methyl a glucopyranoside, which supports the interpretation of the antigen being glycoconjugates. The glycoproteins secreted by RH SLC Lll were incubated with proteinase K. Subsequent electrophoresis followed by Western blot assay showed that all reacting components in the immunoblot assay were lost. Controls incubated without the proteinase were not affected. Thus it seemed clear that the moieties recognized by 43 9F antibody are linked to proteins. Chromatography of the glycoproteins released by RH SLC Lll cells on Sephacryle S 200 showed that the bulk of the W absorbing components as well as nearly all of the glucosamine labelled components were excluded, indicating an M higher than 200 kD. When the glycoproteins were denatured in SDS solution and then hydrolysed exhaustively with proteinase K, 3H labelled carbohydrate chains eluting in a molecular weight region less than that of an ovalbumin marker 45 kD were liberated. However, part of the labelled carbohydrate chains maintained very large sizes eluting at or near the void volume. The secreted glycoproteins were also incubated with endoglycosidase F endo F , a glycosidase cleaving both complex and high mannose type glycans near their asparagine attachment sites in glycoproteins Elder and Alexander, 1982 . Carbohydrate chains were produced having the same size as those after hydrolysis of the glycoproteins with proteinase K, but also large carbohydrates eluting with the void volume were maintained. There was no apparent effect of the endo F on the antigenicity of 43 9F antigen in the dot blot assay, indicating that the large glycoconjugates eluting in the void volume, resistant to hydrolysis by endo F, contain most of the epitope recognized by 43 9F antibody.43 9F Antibody Recognizes a Specific Epitopic CarbohydrateMoeity Radio Immuno Assays were established to examine the binding of labelled 43 9F antibody to 43 9F antigen in the presence of different competitors. The 43 9F antigen itself was used as competitor, as were also the carbohydrate chains purified from the specific glycoproteins after proteolysis of the associated protein as described in Example 4 hereinafter provided. All competitors were derived from the same preparation of 3H glucosamine labelled glycoproteins so that the relative amounts of added competitors could be accurately compared from the 3H label.As shown in Fig. 4, 3H carbohydrates eluting in the void volume of Sephacryl S200 column after exhaustive degradation with proteinase K compete even more strongly than the intact glycoproteins, suggesting that the epitope recognized by 43 9F antibody is contained in these carbohydrate chains. The enhanced competition by the large chain carbohydrates has been repeatedly observed, which rules out the possibility that the 43 9F antibody is recognizing an amino acid sequence sensitive to proteinase K. The smaller chain carbohydrates liberated after proteolysis of the glycoproteins also compete in binding the 43 9F antibody, but more weakly than the intact glycoproteins. Comparison of the competition data indicates that the concentration of the 43 9F epitope is 2.5 to 6 fold lower per 3H glucosamine residue in the smaller chain carbohydrates than in those eluting in the void volume.These results seem to indicate that the epitope recognized by the 43 9F antibody is a carbohydrate sequence, specifically elaborated by the RH SLC Lll cells. The 43 9F epitope could not be found on a panel of human erythrocytes, both before and after neuraminidase treatment, representing a variety of blood group antigens w a b a A,B,O,M,N,S,s,P13C,C ,D,E,c,e,Lu ,Lu ,K,k,Kp K b Lea Leb Fya Fyb rKa JKb, Xga, Vel, Wra, Coa, Cob, Bua, I, Bya asKp ,Fy ,Fy ,Xg tested by direct and indirect agglutination and by dot blot analysis data on solubilized membrane preparations white ghosts . Glycolipid antigen was purified to homogeneity, evidenced by one spot on thin layer chromatography. This spot bound 43 9F antibody. The spot was separated. Structural analysis by methods known in the art can be carried out to define the sugar portion of the glycolipid. The isolated and purified carbohydrate portion, i.e. the isolated and pure epitope is therefore also part of this invention.Anti idiotypic Monoclonal Antibodies Against the 43 9FAntibody Balb c mice were immunized with 43 9F antibody, for example by 3 injections over a period of 3 weeks. Mononuclear spleen cells were isolated after the last immunization and fused with the murine non immunoglobulin producing murine myeloma cell line X63 Ag 8.6.5.3. Hybridoma supernatants showing the ability to bind to 43 9F antibody and, in addition, to compete with 43 9F antigen in radioimmunoassay, were selected and used for the immunization of Balb c mice. Sera from such mice were tested for binding to purified 43 9F antigen and to SLC Lll cells. Purified 43 9F antigen substa tially freed of glycoproteins which do not contain the 43 9F epitope was obtained by affinity chromatography, e.g. on a column of 43 9F antibody conjugated to Sepharose.Detection of 43 9F Antigen in Serum The release of large amounts of 43 9F antigen into the supernatant of RH SLC Lll cultures suggested that a similar process might take place in vivo, and that antigen s reacting with 43 9F antibody consequently could be present in the serum from SLC patients. Serum samples from 109 lung cancer patients were obtained at the time of diagnosis, and analysed for reactivity with 43 9F antibody. In addition, serum samples from 144 patients with other types of cancer were analysed as well as serum from 1910 apparently healthy individuals. As listed in Table 2 about 80 of patients with squamous lung carcinoma were positive at the time of diagnosis, whereas the percentage of positive cases in other types of cancers were about 6 , and in the healthy control group about 1 .

Discussion of the Invention These data indicate that thewmajority of patients with squamous lung cancer have antigenic determinants in their serum that are highly specific for this particular type of cancer. The analysis of antigenic determinants released by cloned cell lines of squamous lung carcinoma and reacting with the same monoclonal antibody further shows that the epitope is situated on the carbohydrate part of glycoproteins mostly those having molecular weights higher than 200 kD and mucin like or proteoglycan like properties. Glycoproteins seem also to be synthesized and released by other cell types.The major difference peculiar to the SLC cells is a modification of the carbohydrate chains in these large glycoproteins. The surprising feature concerning the 43 9F antigen is its specificity for squamous lung cancer. Whereas the carbohydrate epitopes of tumor associated antigens in other cancer types seem to be synthesized by several different kinds of cancer cells and also certain normal cells, no other tumor or cell type than SLC cells have been found to produce the 43 9F antigen. The analysis which involved serum samples from 250 cancer patients, 1900 serum controls, and tumor samples from nearly 300 different cancer patients has been more extensive than most prior studies of tumor associated antigens. The few instances where a non SLC tumor scored positive in ELISA assays were primarily only weak reactions compared to SLC and the few cell types giving weak reactions in dot blot analysis were not competed by excess antibody in the manner of the specific SLC antigen. Thus, not only does this antigen have a significantly higher specificity for human squamous lung cancer than any reported heretofore, but it also seems to be generally one of the most specific tumor associated antigens. The carbohydrate sequence recognized by the 43 9F antibody is associated with a diverse set of glycoproteins.Those in extracts from SLC cells are primarily in mol. wt.range of 50 to 200 kD., but one more minor component has a mol. wt. exceeding 2000 kD. The epitope recognized by the 43 9F antibody is distinct from other known tumor associated carbohydrate antigens V. Ginsburg et al., 1984 . Fig. 4 of the Drawings demonstrate that the carbohydrate chains purified from glycoconjugates shed by SLC cells compete more strongly for binding to the 43 9F antibody than its parent glycoconjugate. The detection of the presence of the 43 9F complete antigen or its characteristic epitope can be carried out in sources or samples such as serum, blood, saliva, urine, tissue, biopsies, bronchial lavage and the like. The detection can be by immunoassay, such as by competitive or immunometric sandwich types. In a competitive assay, the purified 43 9F antigen, or molecule comprising its characteristic epitope, is labelled with a detectable label. The sample suspected of containing the 439F antibody or epitope is incubated with 43 9F antibody and labelled 43 9F antigen, and after formation of any immune complexes, separation and detection, the level of 43 9F antigen is readily determined. Another type of competitive assay involves immobilized 43 9F antigen or epitope and labelled 43 9F antibodyThe presence of 43 9F antigen in the source or sample prevents binding of antibody to immobilized antigen or epitope, thus providing an inverse measure of the presence of antigen. In a competitive type assay, the antibody may also be immobilized on a solid phase, either previous to or subsequent to the formation of the immune complex. For example, a second, anti mouse IgG, antibody immobilized on a solid phase can be added to the mixture, in what is known as a double antibody technique. In an immunometric sandwich assay, one sample of the 43 9F antibody is detectably labelled. Another sample of the antibody is insolubilized on a solid phase. Incubation of sample with labelled and insolubilized antibody leads to a sandwich, where, after separation of unbound antibody ies the amount of label is proportional to the amount of antigen.Immunometric assays can be carried out in forward, reverse or simultaneous modes, depending on the order of addition of the insolubilized and or labelled antibodies. For increased sensitivity in the sandwich system, the procedures described can be modified using biotinylated 43 9F antibody reacting with avidin peroxidase conjugates. Instead of the 43 9F antigen or characteristic epitope, it is possible to use, in assays, anti idiotypic antibodies or immunologically active fragments thereof produced by raising antibodies against the binding site of monoclonal antibody 43 9F. The materials for use in the assay of the invention are ideally suited for the preparation of a kit. Such a kit may comprise a carrier means being compartmentalized to receive in close confinement one or more container means such as vials, tubes, and the like, each of said container means comprising one of the separate elements to be used in any desired method. For example, one of the said container means useful in immunometric assays may comprise monoclonal antibody 43 9F bound to a carrier. A second container may comprise soluble, detectably labelled monoclonal antibody 43 9F, in lyophilized form or in solution. A kit useful for a competitive assay would comprise a first container comprising detectably labelled 43 9F antigen, and a second container comprising 43 9F antibody, free or carrier bound. In addition, the carrier means may also contain a plurality of containers each of which comprises different, predetermined amounts of 43 9F antigen. These latter containers can then be used to prepare a standard curve into which can be interpolated the results obtained from the sample containing the unknown amount of antigen. Practice of the present invention will now be further illustrated by way of the following specific examples which, however, are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.Example 1Tumor Specimens and Cell Cultures Tumor specimens were obtained as fresh biopsy material from patients with a variety of malignant diseases.Institutions contributing specimens were State UniversityHospital, Copenhagen Aalborg Sygehus, Aalborg, Denmark Department of Clinical Chemistry, Oslo, Norway Institute ofCancerology and Immunogenetics, Paris, France StanfordUniversity School of Medicine, Stanford, California City ofHope Medical Center, Duarte, California. The indicated diagnoses were those of the contributing institution. Most of the material was homogenized after isolation of the cortical part of the tumor that normally contains most of the tumor cells, frozen in RPMI 1640 containing 30 FCS with 10 DMSO, and stored in liquid nitrogen. The leukemia samples were obtained from fresh marrow aspirates. Serum samples from cancer patients were obtained at the time of diagnosis at the institutions just named.Serum samples from healthy persons were obtained from blood donors at the following blood banks State University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark Department ofClinical Chemistry, Oslo, Norway and Hospital Paul Brousse,Paris, France. The human SLC cell lines RH SLC Lll and RHSLC L12 were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium plus 15 fetal calf serum RPMI FCS as previously described Olsson et al., 1984 . The cells are routinely grown attached in plastic vessels. They can also grow in serum free RPMI 1640 medium for periods up to 7 days with growth rates only slightly less than that in serum containing media. A human small cell lung carcinoma line RH SCC L10 was similarly maintained as described idem, ibid. .The human cancer cell lines described in Fig. 1 were also grown in RPMI FCS as were also the promyelocytic HL 60 leukemia Gallagher et al. 1979 ,U937 histiocytic lymphoma Sundstrm and Nilsson, 1976 , RHL4 B lymphoma Olsson et al., 1983 , and foreskin fibroblasts. Normal human mononuclear leucocytes and erythrocytes were isolated as described previously idem, ibid. . Normal human lung cell populations were obtained from patients that underwent lobectomy of the lung for reasons other than malignant disease. The biopsies for analysis included a piece of bronchus.Example 2Purificaton of Glycoproteins Released by SLC Cells 2 The RH SLC Lll cells were grown in 150 cm or 300 cm plastic dishes at 370C in 5 CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 4 media minus FSC at cell densities at least 2 x 10 cells per ml . After 4 5 days of growth, the medium was withdrawn, chilled to 40C and centrifuged at 30,000 g for 20 minutes to remove cell debris or other insoluble material. A solution of saturated ammonium sulfate Sigma Grade VI was added slowly with continuous mixing to provide a 75 w v final concentration, and stirred overnight at 40C. The amount of medium processed at a single time varied from 100 ml to 1.5 1. Precipitates were collected by centrifuging at 30,000 g for 30 minutes and resuspended in a small volume of 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 7.0 at a protein concentration of about 2 to 5 mg per ml. Protein concentrations were estimated from UV absorption assuming that a solution of 1.0 mg per ml has 0. D.280 1.0. The preparation or aliquots thereof were then applied to Sephacryl S200, S300, or S400 columns Pharmacia 25 cm x 0.8 cm2 equilibrated with PBS or with PBS plus 0.1 Tween and the column was eluted with the same solution at a flow rate of 20 ml per hr. As shown in Fig. 3, the bulk of the glycoproteins and 43 9F antigen eluted with the void volume. Recovery of glycoprotein was nearly 100 when Tween was included in solutions but was usually less than 30 of applied material without Tween.After degradation with proteinase K, carbohydrates were quantitatively recovered with or without Tween.Example 3 3H labelled Glycoproteins To prepare labelled glycoproteins, the 3H SLCL11 cells were grown for the last 2 days in serum free RPMI1640 media in the presence of 3H glucosamine Amersham 3 1011CiZml, 3.5 Ci mmole. The media was collected and labelled glycoproteins purified as just described.Example 4Purification of Carbohydrates from Glycoproteins The glycoproteins released by RH SLC L11 cells, purified as just described, were boiled for 2 minutes in a solution containing 0.10 M sodium phosphate of pH 7.0 plus 0.10 SDS and then chilled. The solution was diluted 4 fold with the same phosphate buffer to give a protein concentration of 200 300 ug per ml and proteinase K BoehringerMannheim , autodigested for 2 hours at room temperature was added to a final concentration of 3751lg per ml. This was incubated for 16 18 hours at 370C, additional proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 750 pg per ml and incubation continued for 2 3 hours.The solution was boiled for 10 minutes, cooled and applied to a Sephacryl S200 column to separate smaller chain carbohydrates from those eluting at or near the void volume.Example 5Antibody 43 9F IgM The antibody was secreted by the deposited mouse hybridoma cell line. Ascites fluid was partially purified by 2 passing through a 100 cm x 30 cm S300 Sephacryl column and collecting fractions from the void volume. The most highly purified antibody was prepared from supernatant obtained from serum free HB102 media Hana Biologicals, California in which the 43 9F hybridoma was grown. The IgM was precipitated from the media with 50 w v ammonium sulfate and applied toSephacryl S300 column equilibrated with PBS. Fractions from the void volume contained IgM contaminated with only trace amounts less than 0.5 of two other proteins detectable byCoomasie blue staining after electrophoresis on 10 polyacrylamide gels. Example 6Labelling with 1251 Glycoproteins and antibodies were labelled either via lactoperoxidase coupled to beads Biorad or using theIodoGen Pierce reagent Fraker and Speck, 1978 . Labelled proteins were separated from free iodine by centrifugation through a small S25 Sephadex column mounted in a centrifuge tube to catch the flow through containing labelled proteins.Specific activity of antibodies used here was generally in the range of 0.5 2 x 106 cpm per ,ug to avoid multiple labelled molecules. The amount of labelled antibody able to recognize antigen was estimated by applying the antibody to an affinity column Affigel Biorad in which total proteins in a Triton lysate of RH SLC L11 cells were conjugated.Example 7Dot blot Analysis Cell extracts or purified proteins were analysed for binding of antibodies in a dot blot assay with antigen attached to nitrocellulose sheets Biorad . Cultured cancer or normal cells were collected from their growth media by centrifugation, washed in PBS and then washed and resuspended in a solution containing 0.02 M Tris, pH 7.5, 0.02 M NaCl, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.10 M sucrose at a concentration of 1 x 107 to 1 x 108 cells per ml depending on cell volume . The RH SLC Lll cells were suspended at 2 x 107 cells ml.These cells had been scraped loose from plastic dishes with a rubber policeman Cells were disrupted in the presence of 1.0 Triton X 100 in a Potter Elverhjem homogenizer and soluble proteins separated from nuclei and cell debris, all as described Lyderscn and Pettijohn, 1980 . Protein concentration in the cell free extract was determined in an acidic Coomasie brilliant blue solution as described Sedmak and Grossberg, 1977 . Crude extracts or partially purified proteins were applied to nitrocellulose by absorbing a measured sample of 2 5 p1 directly with a micropitette and allowing the sample to air dry. The sheet was then washed in an agitated tray with 2 changes of PBS solution containing 0.05 Tween. Some of the applied protein usually washed off at this time.Measured from retained 3H radioactivity, the 3H glycoproteins purified from media were irreversibly bound to an extent of 20 25 , when applied as described at a concentration of approximately 500 wg per ml or less. The sheets were then incubated in sealed plastic bags with 125I labelled antibody 2. 1 2 x 106 cpm per 100 cm nitrocellulose in PBS solution containing 30 FCS plus 0.05 Tween. After incubation for 2 hours at room temperature in a shaker, the nitrocellulose was removed and washed in PBS Tween solution over a 6 12 hours period with 4 5 changes the sheet was then dried and applied in a plastic envelope to eliminate possibility of 3H radioactivity exposing film to Kodak X ray film at 600C to obtain an autoradiogram of the dot blots. To estimate the relative amount of 125I labelled antibody bound in dot blots, autoradiograms were scanned with a Zeiss recording microdensitometer and integrated via a Brock and Michelsen digital processor. Calibrations were made by scanning autoradiograms of known amounts of 1251 monoclonal antibody.These showed that a linear relationship between integrated areas and bound mcnoclonal antibody existed over a limited range. Example 8Solid Phase Radioimmuno Assay RH SLC Lll released glyccproteins, purified as described in Example 2 were absorbed to the surface of plastic microtiter wells for radioimmune assay. After blocking non specific absorbing sites, each well was incubated for 4 hours with 125I labelled 43 9F antibody in 50 1ll ofPBS containing 1 of FCS. Variable amounts of purified 3Hglucosamine labelled RH SLC Lll released glycoproteins or carbohydrates purified from the same labelled glycoproteins were added as competitors with the labelled antibody. After incubation and washing, the bound 1251 labelled antibody in each well was counted in a gamma counter. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Each data point is an average of 3 identical 3 analyses. Upper curve Competitor was intact H glycopro teins lower curve Competitor was carbohydrate chains purified on Sephacryl columns as described in Example 4.Example 9Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA For testing reactivity of tumor cells with the 439F antibody by ELISA methods Triton X 100 extracts were prepared from tumors and wells of 96 well plates coated with 5 extract corresponding to roughly 105 106 cells, all as described above. The monoclonal 43 9F antibody was peroxidase ccnjugated and the ELISA assay therefore carried out as onestep procedure. The plates were incubated with the specific antibody ca. 100 ng per well for 1 hour at 200C and 1 hour at 37CC, washed in PBS Tween, and incubated with substrate as described by Kennett 1980 and read after 15 minutes an minutes on an automatic Titertek scanner. The values at 45 minutes were used.Optical density O.D. for background values were below 0.200, weak reactions were O.D. 0.2 0.4, strong and very strong reactions had O.D.values of 0.4 0.8 and higher than 0.8, respectively. Some analyses were done in parallel with the 43 9F monoclonal antibody both as catching and detecting antibody. However, the latter type of ELISA was not superior to the one step procedure described above. In contrast, this sandwich ELISA assay was used for analysis of antigen in serum. The one step procedure could not be used in this case, because the serum proteins compete for attachment of the specific antigens to plastic.The assay was therefore done as sandwich assay in which the plates coated with unlabelled 43 9F antibody 1 ,ug per ml, 100 ng per well , washed in PBS Tween, blocked with PBS 1 BSA, incubated with serum diluted 1 1 in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature and 1 hour at 370C, washed, and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with peroxidase conjugated 43 9F. The reading of the test was done as described above. For increased sensitivity in the ELISA system, the procedures described can be modified using biotinylated 43 9F antibody reacting with avidin peroxidase conjugates.
