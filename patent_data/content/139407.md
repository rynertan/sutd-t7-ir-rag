# Data select match.

## Abstract
The present invention is a high performance buffer memory system. The buffer memory system includes two or more associativities. A tag store stores a single tag for all associativities. A logical circuit combines a field from the requesting address with the stored tag to produce a logical output. That logical output is used to make selection from among the associativities in the buffer store. This decision is made and data is selected from one of the associativities at a time prior to the time when it is known whether or not the selected data is valid. At a later time, the decision of whether or not the addressed data is valid is made.
