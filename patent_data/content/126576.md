# AIRFOIL INSPECTION METHOD

## Abstract
An improved inspection method determines how closely the cross sectional configuration of an airfoil corresponds to a reference cross sectional configuration. When an airfoil is to be inspected, the airfoil is measured and the mean camber line is determined. The mean camber lines of the reference and meas ured airfoils are shifted relative to each other through a plurality of relationships. A best fit relationship is determined in which the measured and reference airfoils overlie each other to a maximum extent possible. The best fit relationship can be determined by comparing points on the major side surfaces of the measured and reference airfoils. Alternatively, the best fit relationship can be determined by comparing points on the mean camber lines of the measured and reference airfoils.
