## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONLOGIC CIRCUITBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a logic circuit of a transistor transistor logic TTL of a Totem pole or an open collector type, more particularly, it intends to reduce a propagation delay time due to a capacitive output load when the output of the logic circuit is changed from a high H level to a low L level, with little power consumption. The TTL type logic circuit has a function such as NAND or NOR when a positive logic or a negative logic is used respectively, and is required to be in high packing density and to operate in high speed with low power consumption.The TTL type logic circuit will be abbreviated a TTL circuit hereinafter. When the TTL circuit performs the above function, two kinds of propagation delay time occur, one is a delay time called a Tphl which occurs when the phI output of the TTL circuit changes from H to L level, and the other is a delay time called a T which occurs when plh the output changes from L to H level. Each delay time occurs when a capacitive load like a coaxiaL cable having distributed capacity is connected to the TTL circuit, and the delay time causes to reduce the operation speed of theTTL circuit.The present invention intends to reduce the delay time T This delay time Tphl can be reduced phl phl if high power is allowed to be applied to the TTL circuit, however, it contradicts the saving of power consumption. So reducing the delay time T with little power consump phI tion, in other words, increasing the operation speed with little power consumption has been a problem for the prior art TTL circuit. More detail will be discussed later showing typical TTL circuits of the prior art. Fig. 1 shows a circuit diagram of a prior art TTL circuit of the Totem pole circuit type, and Fig. 2 shows a circuit diagram of a prior art TTL circuit of the open collector circuit type. As shown in the figures, the TTL circuit is composed of an input unit 101 and an output unit 102 or 202. In Fig. 1, the input unit 101 in the prior art TTL circuit of the Totem pole type is composed of ShottkyBarrier Diodes DlA DIB r D1N and a resistor R1, and the output unit 102 is composed of a selective circuit mainly consisting of a selective transistor Qll and an output circuit mainly consisting of a pull up transistor Q14 and a driving transistor Q12, the pull up transistor Q14 forms a Darlington connection with a transistor Q13 The pull up transistor Q14 and the driving transistor 412 are connected each other in a form of Totem pole, so the circuit of this kind is called as Totem pole type TTL circuit.Transistors Qllt Q12 and Q13 are Shottky BarrierTransistors in Fig. 1. When at least one of input logics A, B, , N at input terminals TIA, TIT, , TIN is in L level, transistor QI is OFF and transistor Q13 is ON. Then the base current of transistor Q13 flows from a power supply Vcc through a resistor R12 making transistor Q14 ON, so an output at an output terminal To becomes H level charging stray capacity of the capacitive load CL. When the whole input logics change to H level, transistor Q11 becomes ON and transistor Ql3 becomes OFF. So an Shottky barrier diode D12 makes charge having been stored on stray capacity around emitter circuit of transistor Q13 discharge, and makes transistor Q14 OFF rapidly.Then, the discharge current which flows through diode D12, the collector current of transistor Q which flows through resistor R12, and the base current of transistor Qll are gathered together forming the emitter current of transistor Q11. The emitter current flows to ground through a pull down circuit CT and the base pd emitter of the driving transistor Q12 separately, and most of the emitter current flow through the base emitter junction of transistor Q12 because the impedance of the base emitter of Q12 is much smaller than that of CTpd.As a result, the pull up transistor Ql4 becomes OFF and the driving transistor Q12 becomes ON, so that the output at the output terminal T changes from H to L level. Then, 0 the charge having been stored in stray capacity of the capacitive load CL is discharged through transistor Q12 and the output voltage is pulled down to ground, but it takes a time to complete the operation, this time is the delay time Tphl which depends on capacitance of load CLI characteristics of transistor Q12 such as a current amplification factor, and the base current of transistor Q12 However the base current of transistor 412 is constant, in other words, the base current has no relation to the capacitance of load CL So, though the stray capacitance increases, the base current is not influenced, and it is always constant, therefore, the increase of the stray capacitance increases the delay time Tphl as shown by a curve 51 in Fig. 5, in which C is the stray capacitance of the capacitive load CL. This means that the delay timeTphl of the TTL circuit strongly depends on the stray capacitance of the capacitive load. If the base current of transistor Q12 was allowed to be increased, the delay time could be reduced, however, this contradicts the saving of power consumption in the TTL circuit. In Fig. 2, the same reference symbol or numeral to that used in Fig. 1 designates the same unit or element, and a unit 202 is also an output unit. The input unit 101 is composed of the same elements of that shown in Fig. 1, and unit 202 is composed of a phased splitter transistorQ21 and a driving transistor Q22 In this TTL circuit,Shottky barrier diodes and Shottky barrier transistors are used for respective diodes and transistors. As the TTL circuit is an open collector type, a collector resistor which is usually called a pull up resistor , is not included in the TTL circuit. When at least one of input logics A, B, , N is L level, transistor Q21 is OFF, so transistor Q22 is alsoOFF. Therefore, the stray capacity of load CL is charged up by the power supply Vcc through resistor Rp. When the whole input logics change to H level, transistor Q21 becomes ON, so transistor Q22 also becomes ON.Therefore, the charge stored in the stray capacity of loadCL is discharged to ground through transistor Q22 In this case, the same problem to that in the Totem pole type occurs. That is, when the output voltage at the output terminal To changes from H to L level, it takes the propagation delay time Tphl, because base current of transistor Q22 has no relation to Tphl and the base current phl can not be increased for saving the power consumption of the TTL circuit. Thus, also in this case, the propagation delay time Tphl strongly depends on the stray capacitance of load CL in the open collector type TTL circuit as shown by curve 51 in Fig. 5. As a result, it has been impossible to shorten the propagation delay time which occurs when the output of the TTL circuit changes from H to L level with little power consumption in the prior art TTL circuits of the Totem pole type and the open collector type. This has been a problem of the prior art TTL circuit. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to reduce the propagation delay time produced in the TTL circuit having a capacitive load when an output of the TTL circuit changes from a high level to a low level. Another object of the present invention is to make the propagation delay time free from an amount of stray capacitance distributed on the capacitive load. Still another object of the present invention is to save power consumption in the TTL circuit for reducing the propagation delay time. The present invention can be applied to the TTL circuit of such as a Totem pole type or an open collector type. The present invention can be performed by increasing base current of a driving transistor which is the last output stage in the TTL circuit only in a transient time when the output of the TTL circuit is changing from a high level to a low level, applying circuit elements such as diodes and transistors between the last driving transistor and its pre stage transistor whose emitter is connected to the base of the driving transistor. The applied circuit elements feed back quickly a part of discharge current from the stray capacity of the capacitive load to the base of the driving transistor in the transient time, so that the propagation delay time can be reduced in a short time, saving the power consumption in the TTL circuit.

In the figure, the same reference symbol or numeral to that used in Fig. 1 designates the same unit or element. As shown in the figure, the TTL circuit is provided with additional discharge control transistor Q15 made of a Shottky barrier transistor having a reverse current blocking diode D13 made of a Shottky barrier diode compared with the prior art TTL circuit of Fig. 1. When at least one of the input logics A, B, , N is in L level, the selective transistor Qll is OFF, so the transistor Q13 which is connected to the transistor Q14 forming the Darlington connection is ON, the pull up transistor Q14 is ON. So, transistor Q15 is OFF because its emitter voltage is high compared with its base voltage.As a result, collector current of transistor Q14 charges the stray capacity of the capacitive load CL and the output at the output terminal T0 is kept in H level. Then, when all input logics changes to H levels, transistors Q11 and Q13 become OFF and ON respectively, transistor Q14 becomesOFF, and transistor Q15 becomes ON because its emitter voltage is lowered.So transistor Q15 discharges the charge stored in stray capacity around circuits of the emitter of transistor Q13 and the base of transistor Q14 flow through its base emitter junction, for making transistor Q14 OFF rapidly, and the collector current of transistor Q15 pulls a part of the charge stored in the stray capacity of load CL down to the collector of transistor 911 through diode D13.The base current and the collector current of transistor 915 flow through transistor Q11 and most of them flow through the base emitter junction of the driving transistor 012. This increased base current of transistor Q12 drives transistor Q12 to make its collector current flow more, so that the charge having been stored in the stray capacity of load CL can be rapidly discharged.This means that the base current of the driving transistor Q12 depends on an amount of the charge stored in the capacitive load CL, in other word, the driving transistor Q12 can pull down the charge according to the amount of the stray capacitance of load CL As a result, the relation between the stray capacitance C and the propagation delay time Tphl is decreased as shown by curve 52 in Fig. 5. The curve shows that the propagation delay time Tphl can be shortened independently of the amount of the stray capacitance C, in other words, the propagation delay time can be made free from the stray capacitance of the capacitive load. Figure 6 a shows voltage levels at main points in the TTL circuit of Fig. 3. In the figure, reference numeral 11 is a voltage level at the base of the selective transistor Q1 and numeral 12 is that at its collector, numeral 13 is that at the base of transistor Q15 and numeral 14 is that at the output terminal To The abscissa is time and the ordinate is the voltage level.At the beginning of time in the figure, at least one of the input logics is in L level, and the all input levels change to H at time T . For example, before time tot the level 11 is 0.4 volt V because of voltage drop by the current which flows through resistor Rl and diodes DlA, DlBr r DlN, the level 12 is approximately 5 V because transistor Q11 isOFF and only few base current of transistor Q13 flows, the level 13 is 4 V because of the base emitter voltage drop by the base emitter current of transistor Q13 and the level 14 is 3.2 V because of the voltage drop by leakage current which flows through the Darlington connected transistors Q13 and Q14 the leakage current is inevitable for the TTL circuit, and the capacitive load CL and the voltage of the level 14 is high level output voltage called VOH At the time tot the level 11 rises up to 1.6 V, so the level 12 falls down to 1.2 V a little late from toB then the level 13 also falls down to 0.4 V with a little delay. When the levels 12 and 13 are falling down respectively, transistorQ15 begins to make its collector current flow when the voltage difference between the levels 12 and 13 exceeds base emitter threshold voltage VBE Q15 of transistor Q15 and the flow of the collector current of Q15 ends when the voltage difference becomes less than the threshold voltage VBE Q15. An extent of a hatched zone in Fig. 6 a indicates a conductive zone of transistor Ql5 and T is a time interval in which transistor Q15 is conductive. The driving transistor Q12 runs much collector current, so the level 14 falls down to VOL from VOH in a short time as shown in the figure, where VOL is the output voltage in L level.A dotted line 14 is the output level of the prior art TTL circuit for comparison. Consequently, the propagation delay time can be shortened as shown by the falling part of the level 14 and only little power consumption is required to obtain the short propagation delay time as shown by the hatched zone or the time interval T in Fig. 6 a . Fig. 4 shows an embodiment for an open collector typeTTL circuit of the present invention. In the figure, the same symbol or numeral to that used in Fig. 2 designates the same unit or element. The TTL circuit is provided with additional second discharge control transistor Q23 a first discharge control transistor Q24 made of a Shottky barrier transistor, and a reverse current blocking diode D21 made of a Shottky barrier diode compared with the prior art TTL circuit of Fig. 2. Fig. 6 b shows voltage levels at points 21, 22, 23, and 24 each point is as shown in Fig. 4. When at least one of the input logics is L level, the level 21 at the base of the phased splitter transistor Q21 is 0.4 V because of a voltage drop by the current which flows through resistor R1 and diodes D1A, D1B, , D1N, and transistor Q21 is OFF, so no base current flows through the base emitter junction of the driving transistor Q22 SO that transistor Q22 is OFF.Therefore, stray capacity in the capacitive load CL is charged through the pull up resistor Rp, and the level at the output terminal To is 5V this level is called VOH. On the other hand, the level 22 at the collector of transistor Q21 rises up to approximately 5 V being Vcc so transistor Q23 is ON and cc the base emitter voltage drop by its base emitter base current produces the level 23 so as to be 4 V. However, transistor Q24 is OFF because its emitter voltage is 5 V the level 22 and its base voltage is 4 V the level 23 causing no base current to flow. Then next, when the input logics are changed so that the all logics become H levels at time to, the level 21 rises up to 1.6 V because voltage drop of resistor R1 from V c by the base current of transistor Q21 transistor Q21 cc becomes ON, so the level 22 begins to fall down a little late from time to to 1.2 V finally.During the level 22 is falling down, the level 23 at the base of transistor Q24 begins to fall further a little later to the fall off level 22, so there is time when the base emitter voltage of transistor Q24 exceeds its threshold voltage VBE Q24r so transistor Q24 begins to make its collector current flow through diode D21 provided to block a reverse current flow through transistor Q24. This collector current flows untill when the base emitter voltage becomes less than the threshold voltage. An extent of a hatched zone in Fig. 6 b shows a conductive zone of transistor Q24 and a time interval T is an interval in which transistor Q24 is conductive.During the time interval T, current which flows through resistor R22, the base and collector current of transistor Q24 and also the base current of transistor Q21 are gathered to form the emitter current of transistor Q21. Most of the emitter current flow into the base emitter of the drive transistor Q22 which rapidly pulls down most of the charge have been stored in the stray capacity of the capacitive load CL. Thus the driving transistor Q22 pulls down most of the discharge current from load CL in the time interval T, which means that the TTL circuit saves the power consumption. And when the stray capacitance of load CL increases, the collector current of transistor Q24 also increases, then the base current of transistor Q22 increases, so that transistor Q22 makes the discharging current flow more, which means that the propagation delay time Tphl can be made free from an amount of the capacitance of the capacitive load CL as shown by curve 52 in Fig. 5, and the propagation delay time can be shortened as shown by the levels 24 the level 24 falls down from VOH to VOL in short time comparing with the level 24 which is the level at the output terminal To obtained by the prior art TTL circuit. Consequently, the propagation delay time can be reduced, the propagation delay time can be made free from the capacitance of the output load, and the power consumption of the TTL circuit can be saved, by the Totem pole type and the collector open type TTL circuits of the present invention.
