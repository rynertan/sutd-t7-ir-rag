## Description
The present invention relates to cosmetic compositions and, more particularly to whitening cosmetic compositions for enhancing an whitening effect of the skin. A variety of whitening cosmetics have been proposed or investigated and developed from old in order to remove spots such as stains, freckles, etc. appearing on the skin and to exhibit a whitening effect on the skin as a whole. In the old, peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, zinc peroxide, magnesium peroxide, sodium peroxide, zinc perborate, etc. were formulated in cosmetic compositions. However, these peroxides involve difficulties in storability and adaptability to formulating them in cosmetics because they are extremely unstable substances. Further, their whitening effect was unsatisfactory. Then, cosmetics in which vitamin C, cystein, colloidal sulfur, etc. are formulated have come to be employed but they are still unsatisfactory. In recent days, it has been reported that kojic acid obtained by cultivation of bacteria such as koji mould, etc. has an effect of rendering the skin fair as a whitening component for these whitening cosmetics and, whitening cosmetics using kojic acid are known in, for example, Published Examined Japanese Patent Application No. 18569 81 and Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. 3538 78. Further, derivatives of kojic acid are investigated and cosmetics containing kojic acid derivatives are known, for example, see Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Nos. 7710 81, 7776 81 and 79616 81. Furthermore cosmetics containing pyrone compounds, chromone compounds or flavonol compounds are known, for example, see Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Nos. 3538 78, 92305 80, 111410 80, 111411 80, 143908 80, 157580 80, 14517 82, 35506 82, 131911 83, etc. Further, cosmetics in which placenta extracts are formulated are disclosed, for example, see Published Examined Japanese Patent Application No. 15399 60. The present invention is concerned with cosmetic compositions comprising formulating placenta extracts and kojic acid or derivatives thereof in cosmetic bases. The cosmetic composition is a whitening cosmetic composition having an extremely excellent whitening effect which is exhibited by the placenta extract and kojic acid or derivatives thereof having different mechanisms on tyrosinase which participates in the initial stage of melanine formation. The placenta extracts which are employed in the present invention are aqueous solutions obtained by extracting water soluble portions with water via means of washing placenta of human or animals such as cow, etc., withdrawing blood therefrom, crushing, freezing, etc. and, further removing impurities from the extract. The thus obtained extracts are commercially available as placenta extracts and used mainly as raw materials for cosmetics. These placenta extracts may be any of those derived from human and derived from animals such as cow, etc. but the human derived placenta extracts are preferred. Examples of the kojic acid derivatives used in the present invention include monofatty acid esters of kojic acid, for example, kojic acid monopalmitate, kojic acid monobutyrate, kojic acid monocaprylate and kojic acid monostearate disclosed in Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. 77272 81 difatty acid esters of kojic acid, for example, kojic acid dipalmitate, kojic acid dibutyrate, kojic acid dioleate and kojic acid distearate disclosed in Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. 7776 81 and, in addition thereto, kojic acid monocinnamoate, kojic acid monobenzoate, etc. disclosed in Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. 33207 84 . The ratios of the above placenta extract and kojic acid or kojic acid derivatives are that the kojic acid and or kojic acid derivatives are in a range of 0.1 3 by weight based on the placenta extract 10 weight . The ratios of these effective components to be contained in the cosmetic composition are that the placenta extract is in a range of approximately 0.1 to 10 by weight based on the total cosmetic composition and kojic acid or kojic acid derivatives are in a range of approximately 0.1 to 3 by weight based on the total cosmetic composition. By these ratios, the effect can be sufficiently exhibited. The cosmetic composition of the present invention is applicable mainly as cosmetics for the skin such as lotion, cream, emulsion, pack, etc. and, the placenta extract and kojic acid or kojic acid derivatives are incorporated into cosmetic bases, aids, etc. conventionally used for these cosmetics, to make the cosmetic compositions. For example, with respect to lotions, in a process for producing conventional lotions which comprises dissolving moisturizing agents, skin nutrients or the like, such as glycerin, propylene glycol, etc., in purified water, on one hand, and on the other hand, dissolving perservatives, aromatics, etc. in alcohols, mixing both solutions and solubilizing them at room temperature, the placenta extract and kojic acid or kojic acid derivatives which are effective components of the present invention are incorporated into water soluble portions to make lotions. With respect to creams, in a process for producing conventional creams which comprises incorporating hydrophilic components, for example, moisturizing agents such as glycerin, sorbitol, etc., into purified water to make an aqueous phase portion incorporating, as an oily phase portion, oily components such as perservatives, surface active agents, etc. into solid oils such as beeswax, paraffin, micro crystalline wax, ceresine, higher fatty acids, hardened oils, etc. semi solid oils such as vaseline, lanoline, glycerides, etc., liquid oils such as squalane, liquid paraffin, various ester oils, etc. to control, warming the thus obtained aqueous phase portion and, gradually adding the oily phase portion warmed at the same temperature to the aqueous phase portion while mildly stirring to emulsify them, the placenta extract and kojic acid or kojic acid derivatives which are effective components of the present invention are incorporated into the aqueous phase portion to make creams. With respect to emulsions, in a process for producing conventional emulsions which comprises incorporating moisturizing agents such as glycerin, etc. or pH controlling agents such as acids or alkalis to purified water, mixing them with heating, adding ethanol to the mixture to make an aqueous phase portion on the other hand, incorporating oily components such as perservatives, surface active agents, etc. into solid oils such as beeswax, paraffin, etc., semi solid oils such as vaseline, lanoline, etc., liquid oils such as squalane, liquid paraffin, various ester oils, etc. to control, mixing them with heating to make an oily phase portion, adding the oily phase portion to the aqueous phase portion to perform preliminary emulsification, adding protective colloids such as carboxyvinyl polymer, carboxymethyl cellulose, etc. to the emulsion, homogeneously emulsifying them with a homomixer to make emulsions, the placenta extract and kojic acid or kojic acid derivatives which are effective components of the present invention are incorporated into the aqueous phase portion to make emulsions. With respect to facial packs, in a process for producing conventional facial packs which comprises incorporating rating moisturizing agents such as glycerin, etc., film forming agents such as polyvinyl alcohol, bee gum, etc. into purified water to swell, adding powders such as kaolin, talc, zinc oxide, etc., if necessary, and adding ethanol having dissolved therein aromatics, perservatives, etc. thereto to knead to a paste form, the placenta extract and kojic acid or kojic acid derivatives which are effective components of the present invention are incorporated into the aqueous phase portion to make facial packs. The whitening effect exhibited by the use of the placenta extract and kojic acid or kojic acid derivatives in combination which are effective components of the present invention is synergestic and excellent as compared to the same effect exhibited by the use of each component alone. The foregoing effect is demonstrated by decoloration test using incubated chromocyte. Mouse melanoma B 16 cell hereafter B 16 cell Using Eagle s MEM medium supplemented with 10 bovine fetal serum, 2.2 g l of hydrogen sodium carbonate and 5 mM N 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine N ethanesulfonic acid, incubation was performed in a CO₂ incubator set at 37 C in 5 CO₂. On each test fraction, 1.2 x 10⁵ cells dish of B 16 cells were inoculated. After incubating for 6 days, proliferated cells were dispersed with trypsin and then collected by centrifugal separation at 1000 r.p.m. x 5 minutes. The blackening degree was evaluated with the naked eye. The blackening degree was almost the same as that of the fraction to which nothing was added. The blackening degree was somewhat less than that of the fraction to which nothing was added. The blackening degree was obviously less than that of the fraction to which nothing was added. The blackening degree was slightly noted. The color was white to gray but no blackening was noted. The results are shown in the table below. As is evident from the above results, the effective components of the present invention provide marked inhibitory effect against the formation of melanine, not only as compared to the fraction to which nothing was added but also as compared to the fraction to which one of the effective components of the present invention was added alone. It is known that kojic acid or kojic acid derivatives and the placenta extract which are the effective components of the present invention have the action of inhibiting the formation of melanine, respectively, even by single use. However, by investigations of the present inventors, it has been proved that as a result of analysis on the mechanism of inhibiting the formation of melanine in cell line using B 16 cells used in this test, kojic acid forms a chelation with copper ions which affect the activity of tyrosinase that takes part in the formation of melanine at the initial stage thereby to prevent tyrosinase activity and inhibit the formation of melanine whereas, the placenta extract does not chelate with the copper ions but the mechanism of the placenta extract on preventing the formation of melanine is different from that of kojic acid. As a result, the synergestic effect of both kojic acid or kojic acid derivatives and the placenta extract is believed to be exhibited by the different actions of inhibiting the formation of melanine. Next, the present invention is explained referring to the examples. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
