# Water chilling plant and method.

## Abstract
In a water chilling plant and method, normally with two or more stages of vacuum chilling, the vapour from the chil ling stage or stages 6,7 is presented to an air cooled heat exchanger 2 for condensation in two different flow streams at different stages of compression, so that the cooler air nearer the air inlet works on vapour at a lower stage of com pression.
