# A method for producing lithium aluminate powders.

## Abstract
Î³ form lithium aluminate powder, useful for electrolyte tiles of molten carbonate fuel cells is obtained by mixing aluminum alkoxide with a lithium salt of an inorganic or orga nic acid, lithium hydroxide or lithium oxide in the presence of a non aqueous solvent, and 1.5 to 20 moles water including any water of crystallization contained in the lithium com pound per mole of aluminum alkoxide, and removing the solvent to give a solid which is calcined at 650 C to 1000 C.
