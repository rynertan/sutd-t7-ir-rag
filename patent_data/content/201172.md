## Description
This invention relates to circuit protection devices comprising PTC conductive polymer elements according to the pre characterising portion of claim 1 as it is known from EP A 0 087 884. Conductive polymer compositions exhibiting PTC behavior, and electrical devices comprising them, are well known. Reference may be made, for example, to U.S. Patent Nos. 2,952,761 2,978,665 3,243,753 3,351,882 3,571,777 3,757,086 3,793,716 3,823,217 3,858,144 3,861,029 3,950,604 4,017,715 4,072,848 4,085,286 4,117,312 4,177,376 4,177,446 4,188,276 4,237,441 4,242,573 4,246,468 4,250,400 4,252,692, 4,255,698, 4,271,350, 4,272,471, 4,304,987, 4,309,596, 4,309,597, 4,314,230, 4,314,231, 4,315,237, 4,317,027, 4,318,881, 4,327,351, 4,330,704, 4,334,351, 4,352,083, 4,361,799, 4,388,607, 4,398,084, 4,413,301, 4,425,397, 4,426,339, 4,426,633, 4,427,877, 4,435,639, 4,429,216, 4,442,139, 4,459,473, 4,473,450, 4,481,498, 4,502,929, 4,514,620, 4,517,449, 4,529,866, 4,534,889, and 4,560,498 Particularly useful devices comprising PTC conductive polymers are circuit protection devices. Such devices have a relatively low resistance under the normal operating conditions of the circuit, but are tripped , i.e. converted into a high resistance state, when a fault condition, e.g, excessive current or temperature, occurs. When the device is tripped by excessive current, the current passing through the PTC element causes it to self heat to an elevated temperature at which it is in a high resistance state. The increase in resistance is accompanied by an expansion of the PTC element along an expansion axis. Such devices, and PTC conductive polymer compositions for use in them, are described for example in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,237,411, 4,238,812 4,255,698 4,315,237 4,317,027 4,329,726 4,352,083 4,413,301 4,450,496 4,475,138 and 4,481,498 in European Patent Publication Nos. 38,713, 134,145, and 158,410, and in the commonly assigned patent applications filed contemporaneously with this application corresponding to U.S. Serial Nos. 711,790 MP0991 , 711,907 MP1021 , 711 908 MP1016 , and 711,910 MP1044 . We have been working on the use of circuit protection devices containing PTC conductive polymer elements in situations in which the device is mounted onto, or itself comprises, a wall which is spaced apart from the PTC element and through which the electrodes pass. The wall is usually part of an enclosure which encloses and is spaced apart from the PTC element. The wall can be associated with a plurality of protection devices whose electrodes pass through the wall. In our work we have found that the materials which have hitherto been used for such walls do not give satisfactory results under test condition which are designed to simulate actual fault conditions which may occur, for example when the device is used to provide secondary protection in subscriber loop interface circuits in telecommunications systems. We have found that improved results can be obtained, not only under the test conditions in question but also under other conditions, if the wall through which the electrodes pass is composed of a material which Polymers which, when heated in the absence of air decompose to give a gaseous by product are known. For example, DE1262391 describes arc resistant polymer compositions comprising 60 90 parts by weight of a butadiene styrene copolymer and 40 10 parts by weight of a finely divided non conductive oxide or hydroxide. In a first aspect, this invention provides apparatus which comprises The invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which the Figure is an exploded perspective view of apparatus according to the invention. The thermoset polymers used in the present invention are alkyd resins. Such resins are well known to those skilled in the art and are commercially available. Reference may be made for example to Modern Plastics Encyclopedia, 1981 2, pages 54 and 55. A polyester which includes a high proportion of aromatic groups in its backbone is desirable. Preferably at least one, particularly both, of the acid precursor and the hydroxy precursor of the polyester contains an aromatic radical. The fillers which are dispersed in the thermoset polymers are particulate materials which when heated in the absence of air, will decompose to give a gaseous by product, e.g. one or more of H₂O, CO₂ or N₂. Suitable fillers include hydrated inorganic materials, e.g. fully or partially hydrated metal oxides this term being used to include materials which consist of or contain the corresponding metal hydroxide , for example alumina trihydrate and partial dehydration products thereof. As noted in U.S. Patent No. 4,481,498, failure of protection devices based on PTC elements comprising carbon black dispersed in a polymer can result from the formation of a conductive path between the elecrodes, as a result of the deposition of carbonaceous dust, evolved from the PTC element when it is tripped, onto a surface which joins the electrodes. We theorize that the fillers used in the present invention help to prevent the formation of such conductive paths because, when an arc is struck between the electrodes, via the carbon dust on the surface, the filler decomposes to give a gas which quenches the arc and or blows the carbon dust away, and thus prevents the formation of a permanent low resistance conductive path between the electrodes. The filler is preferably a hydrated inorganic material, e.g. a hydrated metal oxide, particularly alumina trihydrate. The amount of the filler is generally at least 30 , e.g. 35 to 45 , by weight of the material. It is essential that the material comprising the alkyd resin and the filler has an oxygen index as measured by ASTM D 2863 of at least 70, preferably at least 80, particularly at least 90. It is preferred that the material can be injection molded, since the precise configuration of the interior of the container can influence the performance of the device, and preferred configurations are most easily produced by injection molding. I obtained excellent results using the alkyd resin sold by Occidental Chemical Corp. under the trade name Durez 27962 another useful resin, though it does not mold as well as Durez 27962, is the polyester resin sold by Polyply Inc. under the trade name Polyply 453. On the other hand, not all polymers are suitable for use in the wall of the enclosure of the present invention, for example, the polyester resins sold by Plastics Engineering Co. under the trade names Plenco 1581 and 1535 and by Premix Inc. under the trade name Premidry 3130, are not satisfactory in the present invention. Contrary to the teaching of Patent No. 4,481,498, the materials useful in this invention do not, or at least do not necessarily pass the carbon burn off test described in patent no. 4,481,498. In order for the benefits of this invention to be obtained, the filled thermoset polymer must form at least a part of the surface over which a low resistance carbonaceous path is most likely to form during use of the device. Generally, the material will provide at least part, and preferably all, of the surface which lies between the electrodes. Generally the wall through which the electrodes pass will consist essentially of the material. Preferably the whole of the container around the PTC element will be fabricated from the material, preferably by injection molding. Referring now to the drawing, this shows a container which comprises a wall portion 1 having pairs of exit ports 11, 12 passing therethrough and a cover portion 2 which can be fitted to the wall portion 1. The container is composed of an injection molded filled thermoset polymer as defined above. The apparatus also includes five identical circuit protection devices 3, each comprising a pair of electrodes 31 and 32 which are embedded in a PTC conductive polymer element 33 and extend therefrom and fit through the exit ports 11 and 12 in the wall portion 1.
