This invention relates to gastric cytoprotection in oral administration of aspirin. Takagi et al in U.S. Patent 3,988,466, issued October 26, 1977, show that gastric lesions induced by aspirin or indomethacin are prevented by administration of amino acids, in particular, L glutamine, L lysine and L arginine. Goldenberg et al in U.S. Patent 4,016,268, issued April 5, 1977, show that bismuth subsalicylate co admin istered with aspirin or other antiinflammatory drugs combats gastric ulceration associated with such drugs. Seifter et al in U.S patent 4,491,574, issued January 1, 1985 show the use of the vitamin A or precur sor thereof in a method of reducing toxicity and inhibit ing ulcerogenesis and bleeding in the stomach of a mammal due to the ingestion of aspirin. This reference also cites a number of other publications pertaining to vari ous means for inhibiting the gastric ulcerogenic effects of aspirin or other antiinflammatory agents, e.g., indo methacin. 3,3 Thiobis propanoic acid , as shown in THE MERCK INDEX, Tenth Edition, 1983, item 9172, page 1336, is said to be used as an antioxidant for soap products and polymers of ethylene, used in plasticizers and lubri cants, and proposed for use in edible fats, oils and other foods. Leffler in U.S. Patent 2,579,679, issued December 25, 1951, shows the use of thiodipropionic acid, same as 3,3 thiobis propanoic acid , as a stabilizing agent for vitamin B₁₂ in aqueous solution. Sodium thiosulfate, as shown in THE MERCK INDEX, Eighth Edition, 1968, pages 967 8, in addition to having a wide variety of non medicinal uses, has been used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning, in some thrombotic conditions, topically for tinea versicolor, and, formerly for arsenical dermatitis. Also, it is said to have low human toxicity. As shown in THE MERCK INDEX, Tenth Edi tion, 1983, item 8542 p. 1243 , sodium thiosulfate is said to be useful in various veterinary indications in cats, e.g., antidote in cyanide poisoning, as a general detoxifier , in bloat, and externally in ringworm, mange. Fasth et al, Biochemical Pharmacology Van Moorleghem French Patent Publication 2,318,649, published February 18, 1977, pertains to medicaments containing bisublimed iodine, sodium or potassium iodide, an alkaline salt, a plasma substitute, an analgesic, anti inflammatory and antipyretic, and an anesthetic agent, said medicaments useful for the treatment of rheum atism and cancer.

The present invention provides a composition for providing cytoprotection of the gastric mucosa in a mammal receiving aspirin perorally which comprises aspirin in com bination with a cytoprotectively effective amount of sodium thiosulfate or 3,3 thiobis propanoic acid . The invention further provides a method of providing cytoprotection of the gastric mucosa in a mammal receiving aspirin perorally which comprises orally administering either prior to or in combination with aspirin a cytoprotectively effective amount of 3,3 thiobis propanoic acid alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The invention yet further provides a method of preventing or inhibiting gastric lesions in a mammal receiving aspirin perorally which comprises orally administering either prior to or in combination with aspirin a cytoprotectively effective amount of 3,3 thiobis propanoic acid alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Various studies or experiments were carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of sodium thiosulfate and 3,3 thiobis propanoic acid as a gastric cytopro tective agents. Fasted Sprague Dwaley female rats were given intragastrically ig at least four different doses ranging from 1 30 mg 100 g. body weight of sodium thiosulfate either 30 minutes before or parallel with intragastric administration of 10 mg 100 g body weight of acidified aspirin. Rats were killed one hour after aspirin administration and the number of hemorrhagic gastric erosions or lesions was determined and the area of erosion was measured by computerized planimetry. Sodium thiosulfate coadministered with aspirin was found to offer significant p 0.01 gastric cytoprotection, the minimum statistically significant effective dose for sodium thiosulfate as its pentahydrate being about 5 mg 100 g. and for anhydrous sodium thiosulfate being about 3 mg 100 g. The effectiveness of sodium thiosul fate as cytoprotectant against aspirin induced gastric lesions was also demonstrated in arthritic rats using the standard pharmacological antiinflammatory adjuvant induced arthritis assay wherein it also was established that sodium thiosulfate did not reduce the antiinflam matory efficacy of aspirin. Also, it was shown that sodium thiosulfate and the coadministered combination of sodium thiosulfate with aspirin had a low order of toxicity. Fasted Sprague Dawley Female rats were given intragastrically ig at least three different doses ranging from 5 30 mg 100 g body weight of 3,3 thiobis propanoic acid either 30 minutes before or parallel with intragastric administration of 10 mg 100 g body weight of acidified aspirin. Rats were killed one hour after aspirin administration and the number of hemorrhagic gastric erosions or lesions was deter mined and the area of erosion was measured by computer ized planimetry. 3,3 Thiobis propanoic acid TBPA co administered with ASA was found to offer significant p 0.01 gastric cytoprotection, the minimum effective dose being about 30 mg 100 g. The effectiveness of TBPA as cytoprotectant against ASA induced gastric lesions was also demonstrated in arthritic rats using the stand ard pharmacological antiinflammatory adjuvant induced arthritis assay wherein it also was established that TBPA did not reduce the antiinflammatory efficacy of ASA. Also, it was shown that coadministration of TBPA with ASA did not affect the bioavailability of ASA, and, further, that TBPA and the coadministered combination thereof with ASA had a low order of toxicity. Said composition aspect of the invention can be prepared by combining the aspirin and sodium thiosulfate or TBPA alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient carrier in conventional dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, caplets, and the like. A preferred embodiment of said invention resides in a composition that contains in a gelatin capsule a mixture of aspirin and sodium thiosul fate, said mixture alone or in combination with a pharma ceutically acceptable excipient, such as starch, silica or other conventional formulating excipient or additive. Because aspirin and sodium thiosulfate in admixture do not have extended shelf life at room temperature 25 C. and above as shown hereinbelow, said composition is freshly prepared shortly before use. Alternatively, it is contem plated that the aspirin and sodium thiosulfate can be formlated so that the aspirin and sodium thiosulfate are isolated from each other, for example, by encapsulat ing the particles of either or both with a suitable poly meric coating such as ethylcellulose or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose prior to formulation, or by interposing an inert barrier between the ingredients, for example by pelletizing one of the two ingredients, placing the pellet in a gelatine capsule, covering the pellet with a pharmaceutically acceptable inert excipient such as starch or silica and then adding the second ingredient, or by placing each ingredient in separate layers of a multilayered tablet having an inert barrier between the layers. Mixtures of aspirin and TBPA are stable at room temperature and above, up to 50 C or more, as shown hereinbelow. Said compo sition can be formulated in capsule form, e.g., a gelatin capsule, as a mixture of ASA and TBPA, said mixture alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, such as starch, silica or other conventional formulating excipient or additive. Alternatively and preferably, the ASA and TBPA can be formulated in tablet form by conventional means utilizing conventional formu lating excipients or tabletting aids. It is contemplated that the ASA and TBPA can be formulated in controlled or sustained release form, for example, by encapsulating the particles of either or both in an appropriate conven tional polymeric coating such as ethylcellulose or hydroxy propyl methylcellulose and then combining the encapsu lated ASA and TBPA particles in combined dosage form either in gelatin capsules or in tablets formulated by conventional means. Ordinarily sodium thiosulfate containing compostions will contain from about 0.5 to 1.5 part by weight of sodium thiosulfate per part of aspirin, preferably about equal parts by weight the two ingredients. More sodium thiosulfate, up to about three parts by weight per part of aspirin, can be used. Smaller amounts of sodium thiosulfate can be used, i.e., as low as about 0.15 part of sodium thiosulfate per part by weight of aspirin. The actual weights of said ingredi ents per unit dosage form depends on the dosage of aspirin to be administered, such normal adult doses as 325 mg, 500 mg, 650 mg and 1 g. Smaller doses of course are used for children and in some instances larger doses may be used as an adult dosage. Ordinarily the composition will contain from about 1 to about 3 parts by weight of TBPA per part of ASA, preferably about equal parts by weight the two ingred ients. The actual weights of said ingredients per unit dosage form depend on the dosage of ASA to be adminis tered. Therapeutically effective dosage amounts of ASA are of course well known in the art and range from about 80 mg. to about 1 g. The most common adult doses are 325 mg, 500 mg, 650 mg and 1 g. Smaller doses, between about 80 to 325 mg, of course are used for children and in some instances larger doses may be used as an adult dosage. In preparing in conventional manner tablets con taining said ingredients, there may be incorporated prior to or during tabletting the conventional tabletting aids or excipients, such as binders, disintegrants, lubricants, plasticizers, diluents, colors, surfactants or wetting agents, and the like. Illustrative of these excipients are Sodium thiosulfate can be used either as its penta hydrate or, preferably, in its anhydrous form. In carrying out the method aspect the aspirin and sodium thiosulfate or TBPA can be coadministered using said composition aspect or the sodium thiosulfate or TBPA and aspirin can be administered in separate unit dosage forms either simultaneously or sequentially, i.e., the sodium thiosulfate or TBPA followed by the ASA. Dosage regimen, i.e., freq uency of administration, is well known in aspirin therapy. There follow examples and results which demon strate the effectiveness of the method and composition aspects of the invention. Thus, the following test re sults are exemplary of the present ASA therapy improve ment as applied to mammals and as demonstrated with rats. It is known to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical chemistry that the experiments performed on animals as illustrated herein are indicative of corresponding effect in humans. The following examples will further illus trate the invention without, however, limiting it thereto. All of the experiments in this example were per formed in female Sprague Dawley rats having an initial body weight of 150 200 g. The animals housed under 12 hour light and dark cycles initially had an unlimited access to Purina laboratory chow and tap water. Before the administration of aspirin, the rats were fasted over night. Every group control and experimental consisted of 3 4 rats and each experiment was repeated at least twice and the results were pooled. The extent of gastric mucosal injury was evaluated by a Zeiss stereomicroscope coupled with a computerized planimeter which allowed both surface measurement and counting of lesions, accord ing to the published method of Sandor Szabo et al entitled A Quantitative Method for Assessing the Extent of Experi mental Gastric Erosions and Ulcers , J. Pharmacological Methods Aspirin was suspended in 1 methylcellulose dis solved in 200 mM HCl and was administered at 10 mg 100 g body weight by gavage with rubber tube Rusch No. 8 and rats were killed one hour later. The study design is presented as follows in Table A. In the initial experiment, doses of sodium thiosul fate as its pentahydrate were given In the parallel administration protocol, the mini mum statistically significant effective dose MED of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate was 5 mg 100 g on the basis of both area of lesions and number of lesions, as seen from Tables B and C, wherein the data are expressed respectively as percentage of glandular stomach area and as total number of erosions. The minimum statistically significant effective dose MED of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate was about 5 mg 100 g or about 50 mg kg, i.e., about 201 µmol kg. The absolute MED of sodium thiosulfate in anhydrous form is about 32 mg kg. The above experiments indicate that coadministra tion of nontoxic doses of sodium thiosulfate as its pentahydrate decrease or abolish aspirin induced gastric mucosal lesions. Male Sprague Dawley rats initial weight of 280 353g received single oral daily doses of anhydrous sodium thiosulfate at either 150 or 300 mg kg for 16 days coadministered with 150 mg kg of aspirin in an adju vant induced arthritis assay C.J. Pearson, Experimental Joint Disease , J. Chron. Dis. Male Sprague Dawley rats initial weight of about 200 g. received a single oral dose of sodium thiosul fate anhydrous at either 30, 100 or 300 mg kg coadmin istered with 100 mg kg of aspirin in the carrageenin model of acute inflammation paw edema C.A. Winler et al, Carrageenin Induced Edema in Hind Paw of the Rat as an Assay for Anti Inflammatory Drugs, Proc. Soc. Exptl. Biol. Med. Results of these studies are given in Table F which also includes data for the standard phenylbutazone. Male Sprague Dawley rats initial weight of 225 to 250 g. received single oral daily doses of sodium thiosulfate anhydrous at either 150 or 300 mg kg for 16 days either alone or coadministered with 150 mg kg of aspirin in said adjuvant induced arthritis assay. It was found that sodium thiosulfate did not demonstrate an effect on the development of arthritis and, also, that its coadministration with aspirin did not influence the anti inflammatory efficacy of aspirin. Results of these studies are given below in Tables G and H. Sodium thiosulfate anhydrous was given as a single oral dose to male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 116 140 g to determine its approximate acute oral LD₅₀. The rats were fasted for four hours before medication, observed for seven days following medication and all surviving rats sacrificed and necropsied at the completion of the study. Sodium thiosulfate thus was found to have an ALD₅₀ of 7,000 mg kg 7 days . This indicated a low order of acute toxicity although gastric irritancy was observed at this very high dose level. Capsules containing various mixtures of aspirin or aspirin starch granulation with sodium thiosulfate are shown in Examples 6 9. 25 Capsules containing a 50 50 mixture of anhy drous sodium thiosulfate 325 mg and aspirin 325 mg were prepared. The capsules were then assayed for aspirin and free salicylic acid and the contents were examined for evaluation of compatibility of two said ingredients. After 7 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said standard ultraviolet spectro metric analytic procedure was 312.5, 325.0 and 321.2 mg. No salicylic acid was detected. After 65 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by the HPLC assay procedure detailed hereinbelow Ex. 10 was 98.2 and 96.4 mg. The quantity of salicylic acid found per capsule was 1.8 and 1.78 . The procedure of this example was like that of Example 6 but using 406 mg of an 80 20 aspirin starch granulation containing 325 mg of aspirin in place of 325 mg of aspirin ASA . After 7 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said ultraviolet spectrometric pro cedure was 312.5, 312.5 and 337.5 mg. No salicylic acid was detected. After 65 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said HPLC assay procedure was 96.9 . The quantity of salicylic acid found per capsule was 2.2 . This example was carried out following the proced ure of Example 6 but using 50 mg instead of 325 mg of sodium thiosulfate and using size 1 rather than size 0 capsules. After 4 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said ultraviolet spectrometric pro cedure was 312.5, 321.2 and 328.2 mg., and no salicylic acid was detected. After 62 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said HPLC assay procedure was 97.6 and the quantity of salicylic acid found per capsule was 0.9 . This example was carried out following the proced ure of Example 7 but using 50 mg instead of 325 mg of sodium thiosulfate and using size 1 rather than size 0 capsules. After 4 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said ultraviolet spectrometric pro cedure was 325, 325 and 325 mg, and no salicylic acid was detected. After 62 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said HPLC assay procedure was 95.5 the quantity of salicylic acid found per capsule was 0.9 . To study the stability at 25 C., 40 C. 75 RH and 70 C, of mixtures of aspirin ASA with sodium thio sulfate STS , and 80 20 ASA starch granulation ASA SG with sodium thiosulfate STS . All samples were prepared by grinding the combin ation in a mortar with pestle. Samples were well mixed, stored in amber glass vials with metal screw cap closures each having a pressure sensitive ethyl vinyl acetate liner, and placed in the stress chambers. Samples were withdrawn for HPLC analysis after one week. This method separates aspirin and salicylic acid by high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC . Sample mixtures are extracted with methanol, suitably diluted and chromatographed using the MCH 10 Varian 4.6x25 mm column. The mobile phase consists of 40 A and 60 B A 0.02 phosphoric acid, B methanol . The mobile phase was run at 2 ml min and the UV detector was set at 285 NM. The retention time of aspirin is 3.1 min. and that of salicylic acid is 5.3 min. All of the experiments in this example were per formed in female Sprague Dawley rats having an initial body weight of 150 200 g. The animals housed under 12 hour light and dark cycles initially had an unlimited access to Purina laboratory chow and tap water. Before the administration of aspirin, the rats were fasted over night. Every group control and experimental consisted of 3 4 rats and each experiment was repeated at least twice and the results were pooled. The extent of gastric mucosal injury was evaluated by a Zeiss stereomicroscope coupled with a computerized planimeter which allowed both surface measurement and counting of lesions, accord ing to the published method of Sandor Szabo et al entitled A Quantitative Method for Assessing the Extent of Experi mental Gastric Erosions and Ulcers , J. Pharmacological Methods ASA was suspended in 1 methylcellulose dissolved in 200 mM HCl and was administered at 10 mg 100 g body weight by gavage with rubber tube Rusch No. 8 and rats were killed one hour later. The study design is presented as follows in Table J. In the initial experiment, doses of TBPA were given In the parallel administration protocol, the mini mum statistically significiant effective dose MED of TBPA was 30 mg 100 g on the basis of both area of lesions and number of lesions, as seen from Tables K and L, wherein the data are expressed respectively as percentage of glandular stomach area and as total number of erosions. The above experiments indicate that coadministra tion of nontoxic doses of TBPA decrease or abolish ASA induced gastric mucosal lesions. Male Sprague Dawley rats initial weight of 280 353g received single oral daily doses of TBPA at either 150 or 300 mg kg for 16 days coadminis tered with 150 mg kg of aspirin in an adjuvant induced arth ritis assay C.J. Pearson, Experimental Joint Disease , J. Chron. Dis. Male Sprague Dawley rats initial weight of about 200 g received a single oral dose of TBPA at either 30, 100 or 300 mg kg coadministered with 100 mg kg of ASA in the carrageenin model of acute inflammation paw edema C.A. Winler et al, Carrageenin Induced Edema in Hind Paw of the Rat as an Assay for Anti Inflammatory Drugs, Proc. Soc. Exptl. Biol. Med. Results of these studies are given in Table P which also includes data for the standard phenylbutazone. In another experiment using above said test pro cedure, TBPA at a dose of 300 mg kg was found to produce no inhibition 0 , that is, it was found to have no anti inflammatory activity. Male Sprague Dawley rats initial weight of 225 to 250 g received single oral daily doses of TBPA at either 150 or 300 mg kg for 16 days either alone or co administered with 150 mg kg of aspirin in said adjuvant induced arthritis assay. It was found that TBPA did not demon strate an effect on the development of arthritis and, also, that its coadministration with aspirin did not influ ence the anti inflammatory efficacy of aspirin. Results of these studies are given below in Tables Q and R. TBPA was given as a single oral dose to male Sprague Dawley rats to determine its approximate acute oral LD₅₀. The rats were fasted for four hours before medication, observed for seven days following medication and all surviving rats sacrificed and necropsied at the comple tion of the study. TBPA thus was found to have an ALD₅₀ of 6,000 mg kg 7 days . This indicated a low order of acute toxicity although gastric irritancy was observed at this very high dose level. Sprague Dawley male rats having initial body weights of 160 185 g received a single oral dose of ¹⁴C aspirin at 100 mg kg and displayed a blood radioactivity peak equivalent to 176 10.5 µg of aspirin per ml at 1.6 0.32 hours postmedication. When TBPA 300 mg kg was admin istered 30 seconds prior to ¹⁴C aspirin 100 mg kg , there was observed a blood radioactivity peak equivalent to 189 2.1 µg of aspirin per ml. at 2.3 0.29 hours post medication. Nearly complete recovery of radioactivity was obtained in urine within 48 hours postmedication for all dose groups. In addition, 24 hour urinary meta bolite profiles, as determined by gradient HPLC with radioactivity detection, were qualitatively similar among all dose groups. Thus, coadministration of TBPA at 300 mg kg had no apparent effect on the bioavailability of ¹⁴C aspirin. The test results obtained are given in Tables S and T. The compatibility and stability of mixtures of ASA and TBPA are illustrated by Examples17 20. To study the stability at 40 C. 75 RH and 70 C. after one week of mixtures of ASA with TBPA and 80 20 Aspirin starch granulation aspirin SG with TBPA. All samples were prepared by grinding the combin ation in a mortar with pestle. Samples were well mixed, stored in amber glass vials with metal screw cap closures each having a pressure sensitive ethyl vinyl acetate liner, and placed in the stress chambers. Samples were withdrawn for HPLC analysis after one week. This method separates aspirin and salicylic acid SA by high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC . Sample mixtures are extracted with methanol, suitably diluted and chromatographed using the MCH 10 Varian 4.6x25 mm column. The mobile phase consists of 40 A and 60 B A 0.02 phosphoric acid, B methanol . The mobile phase was run at 2 ml min and the UV detector was set at 285 NM. The retention time of aspirin is 3.1 min. and that of SA acid is 5.3 min. Like that of Example 17 but determining aspirin stab ility after two, three and seven weeks at 50 C. When tested after three and seven weeks at 50 C, no changes in aspirin, SA and physical appearance were found for any of the above combinations. Like that of Example 17 but determining aspirin stab ility after ten weeks at 25 C and seven weeks at 50 C. Like that of Example 17 but determining Aspirin stab ility after three weeks at 40 C. 75 RH , 50 C. and 70 C. Capsules containing various mixtures of aspirin or aspirin starch granulation aspirin SG with TBPA are shown in Examples 11 14. 25 Capsules containing a 50 50 mixture of TBPA 325 mg and aspirin 325 mg were prepared. The capsules were then assayed for aspirin and free SA and the contents were examined to evaluate the compatibility of the two said ingredients. After 8 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said standard ultraviolet spectrometric analytic procedure was 356.2, 356.2 and 365.0 mg. No SA acid was detected. After 67 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said HPLC assay Ex. 7 was 101.8 and no SA was detected. The procedure of this example was like that of Example 21 but using 406 mg of an 80 20 ASA starch granu lation containing 325 mg of ASA in place of 325 mg of aspirin. After 7 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said ultraviolet spectrometric procedure was 337.5, 337.5 and 337.5 mg. No SA was detected. After 67 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by HPLC assay was 100.6 , and no SA was detected. This example was carried out following the proced ure of Example 21 but using 50 mg instead of 325 mg of TBPA and using size 1 rather than size 00 capsules. After 5 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said ultraviolet spectrometric procedure was 318.8, 321.3 and 321.3 mg., and no SA was detected. After 67 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said HPLC assay was 98.8 , and no SA was detected. This example was carried out following the proced ure of Example 22 but using 50 mg instead of 325 mg of TBPA and using size 0 rather than 00 capsules. After 5 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said ultraviolet spectrometric procedure was 318.8, 331.3 and 328.8 mg, and no SA was detected. After 67 days at 25 C., the quantity of aspirin found per capsule by said HPLC assay was 99.0 and no SA was detected.
