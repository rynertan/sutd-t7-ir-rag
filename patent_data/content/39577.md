## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PRESSWORKING A WORKPIECE OR MATERIAL This invention relates to a method for pressworking of articles and material and apparatus for effecting the same. By pressworking is meant any process, such as punching, drawing, closed die forging, extrusion, briquetting or injection moulding carried out on articles or material of metallic or non metallic character whereby the articles or material are worked by transmission thereto of a requisite amount of energy for the working operation in question. In a variety of working procedures as aforesaid, provision is made for energy release, this being energy accumulated for transmittal to the article and transmitted to the article only once in carrying out a working stroke of the pressing machine. Presses for effecting working in such manner may comprise a fly wheel for accumulating the energy of their motor, a clutch and a crank, eccentric or cam type mechanism with slider for achieving one off release of the required amount of energy to the article or material. One type of press of such type is a mechanical press which may be of conventional design and comprise a lowinertia motor with transmission gear and a power cam which is in contact with a roll attached to a quaternary four hinge lever for effecting force transmittal in proportion to the force supplied thereto and which may be termed proportional force transformation , the lever being connected to an elastically deformable member such as a rod or plate springs for accumulating the required amount of energy and connected to a working member for a single release of this energy to the article or material to be worked. An alternative type of press of the aforementioned type is a hydraulic press which comprises a hydraulic power unit, a hydraulic accumulator and a hydraulic power cylinder for single release of the required amount of mechanical energy to the worked article. Typically, such presses are used when working metal or plastics articles in the form of moulding powder or granules. A general problem with the aforementioned procedures for effecting press working is that when a greater energy than is usual is necessary for press working a particular article, it is necessary to employ a more expensive and more powerful press of heavier weight. In the case of presses comprising a fly wheel or with elastically deformable members, it is necessary to use a more expensive and more powerful machine of heavier weight because of the shortness of the power stroke and the limited effect which can be achieved with such a machine through one stroke operation. A general disadvantage of employing machines with fly wheels is that they operate with impacts and the article or material being worked cannot be maintained compressed in order that it may be subjected to an additional heat treatment. The more expensive hydraulic presses have to be used in such cases. A further problem encountered with fly wheel presses is that it is possible to take up from the fly wheel in one working stroke of the slider only a small proportion of the total large quantity of potential energy accumulated in the fly wheel. Moreover, the power stroke, that is,the portion of the total stroke at which the fly wheel can release its nominal force, is comparatively short with an abrupt transition taking place to non availability of energy at the end of the stroke.A further problem with the aforedescribed mechanical presses is that while their power stroke is comparatively short, their auxiliary stroke is even shorter and force is applied to the workpiece according to a decreasing force function, being proportional to the reduction of the stress in the release of energy from the plastic deformable member.These problems taken together reduce considerably the usefulness of these presses. A problem with hydraulic presses is that they are of particularly heavy weight, are more expensive, more complex and less reliable than fly wheel presses. Such presses are slower and have a lower productivity than fly wheel presses.They require a larger floor area and have a lower energy efficiency because of the repeated transformation and energy losses which occur when they are being operated.The simultaneous control of energy release, displacements and velocities cannot be achieved in practice. A characteristic disadvantage of the aforementioned operation both by means of impacts through the use of fly wheels and use of hydraulic presses is that an increase in the coefficient of friction between the workpiece or material being worked and the working tool takes place when the working tool is at rest after being in motion. This leads to defects in the final product and also to a reduction of the pressing force which may be applied during the next pressing step. It is an object of the present invention to provide a means for carrying out pressworking of a workpiece or material in which any tendency for the coefficient of friction between the workpiece or material being worked and the tool at the time of transition from motion to rest of the working tool is minimised. It is a further object of the invention to provide a pressworking apparatus having a longer regulable auxiliary stroke with the capability of releasing over the greater portion of this stroke a nominal force to the workpiece or material and which is such that during the power stroke, the force transmitted to the workpiece or material is constant or increases during the course of the power stroke. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of carrying out a pressworking operation on a workpiece or material to be worked by transmitting pressworking energy to said workpiece or material in a plurality of steps, each step comprising a high power phase during which an elastically deformable energy carrier releases previously accumulated potential energy and a low power phase of longer duration during which energy is supplied by an auxiliary energy source of lower power, which energy supplies and tool displacements caused thereby are in accordance with predetermined relationships for the said workpiece or material to be worked in respect of both magnitude of energy supply and the relationship between the respective phases such that smooth transitions occur between the said phases and such that during said low power phase the rate of displacement of a working tool for carrying out the press working operation is sufficient to avoid a sudden increase in the coefficient of friction between the working tool and said workpiece or material and the velocity of displacement of the working tool does not change its sign until completion of working of said workpiece or material, a recharging of the elastically deformable energy carrier with potential energy ready for the high power phase of the next step for press working the workpiece or material taking place during said low power phase. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a press apparatus for use in carrying out a pressworking operation on a workpiece or material which comprises a power cam, powered means for driving the power cam, a roll contacted by the power cam attached to a quaternary lever at one connection point of said lever, hinged means connecting the quaternary lever to a first rigid support at a second connection point of the lever, an elastically deformable member connecting a third connection point of said lever with a second rigid support and means connecting the lever at its fourth connection point to arunit carrying the working tool of the apparatus and capable of reciprocating movement, the power cam including at least one sector which when in contact with the roll causes energy to be accumulated in the elastically deformable member and one other section which when in contact with the roll causes energy release from the elastically deformable member to occur over a shorter time period than that during which energy accumulation occurs.Characteristic features of the pess apparatus are that a hinged connecting rod joins the unit carrying the working tool to the quaternary lever, the spatial arrangement between the connection points of the quaternary lever with the first rigid support, with the elastically deformable member and with the hinged connecting rod is such that the quaternary lever is a functional force varying member capable of effecting accumulation of potential energy in the elastically deformable member when said one sector of the power cam is in contact with the roll and release of potential energy through the lever to the hinged connecting rod when the other section of the power cam is in contact with the roll, and that a hinge between the two semi rods which make up the hinged connecting rod with a hinge therebetween is connected to drive means for effecting powered variation of the angle between the semi rods, the drive means being operable to take up displacement of the unit carrying the working tool with same velocity sign when the elastically deformable member has released all its potential energy and to allow displacement of the unit to be continued with the same velocity sign when further potential energy has been accumulated in the elastically deformable member. A press apparatus embodying this invention comprises a quaternary lever whose force transmission to the unit carrying the working tool should be regulable for a specific spatial disposition of the connection points thereof, for which purpose the angle between the lowest position of the connection point to the hinged rod, the first rigid support and the position of a hinge whereby the end of the hinged rod remote from the connection point to the quaternary lever is attached to the unit carrying the working tool is less than 900 but greater than the angle executed by the quaternary lever in undergoing reciprocating motion, while the angle between the connection point of the quaternary lever to the elastically deformable member, the first rigid support and the point of attachment of the elastically deformable member to the second rigid support should be greater than the angle executed by the quaternary lever in undergoing reciprocating motion. The press apparatus preferably comprises a two part unit carrying the working tool. The two parts are connected together by screw means operatively connected for example through a nut on the screw to drive means with appropriate reduction gear for enabling the distance between the two parts to be varied. The press apparatus may comprise a programme control device which will control operation of the apparatus in accordance with predetermined patterns. In particular, it may be operable on the drive means for the power cam to coordinate the positioning of the aforementioned sectors of the power cam and of the hinged connecting rod in accordance with the character of the workpiece or material and the press operation to be carried thereon. The positioning of the hinged connecting rod may itself be achieved readily if the hinge between the two semi rods is formed as a nut connectable to a driving screw having associated drive means and appropriate gearing.A programme control device as aforesaid may also be operable on the drive means of a two part unit as aforesaid carrying the working tool and serving to set the spacing apart of the parts in accordance with the character of the workpiece or material and the press operation to be carried out thereon. The press apparatus may comprise more than one set of quaternary levers, elastically deformable members and hinged connecting rods which can be arranged symmetrically about the unit carrying the working tool and can be driven by a single power cam positioned centrally. Driving screws connected to the hinged positions of the semi rods can then be provided with left hand and right hand threads. With one preferred form of press apparatus embodying this invention, a cylindrical hinge joins the semi rods of the hinge connecting rod and a transverse lever connects the hinge to a driving lever supported on an adjustable hinge support at one end thereof and connected at its other end to an auxiliary roll in forced contact with an auxiliary cam. The auxiliary cam is integral with the power cam or mounted for motion synchronous with that of the power cam and has a first sector of radius which decreases from a maximum to a minimum value in the direction of rotation thereof and which is followed by a second sector of increasing radius from a minimum value to a maximum value in the direction of rotation.These sectors correspond in phase and size to a sector of the power cam which when in contact with the main roll as aforesaid causes energy accumulation in the elastically deformable member to occur. The auxiliary cam has a further sector of. constant radius which corresponds in phase and size to a sector of the power cam which when in contact with the roll causes energy release from the elastically deformable member to occur. The adjustable hinged support is capable of displacement on an inclined plane and has locking means for holding it in a predetermined position whilst simultaneously being held on the driving lever so that the aforesaid plane is parallel to the alignment of the driving lever in its end position of travel corresponding to when the connecting rod is straight. A press apparatus embodying the invention has the advantage t.hat, although it may comprise driving motors of lower power, it has the concomitant advantages of reduced weight, small floor area occupancy and lower overall price, since,between the short time intervals of intensive energy release, there are longer time intervals for accumulation of energy in the elastically deformable member during which only a small amount of energy is transmitted to the workpiece and no interruption in the working process.Moreover, the coefficient of friction between the working tool and the workpiece or material being worked is enabled to increase to the value it would have if the working tool were at rest. Nevertheless, despite the aforementioned character of the press apparatus, its productivity is comparable with that of hitherto used machines of heavier weight. This result is considered to be due to two factors 1. The net machine time when working articles or material consuming more energy is small in relation to the auxiliary time required for inserting the workpieces or material and removing the pressed articles, and 2. It is possible to adapt the various motors in combination with the programme control device flexibly to the loads to be imposed on the working tool and corresponding to the articles or material being worked. An advantage of the press devices over hydraulic presses lies in that, not only is the auxiliary stroke of the press apparatus faster and its regulation free. of energy losses, the inconvenience of needing to use a long hydraulic cylinder which is able to develop a great force only at the end of the stroke, has a large diameter and volume requiring a large amount of oil and which works slowly with poor efficiency is avoided. A particular advantage of operating in accordance with the present invention in contrast to the use of mechanical presses is that the apparatus embodying the invention is flexible in that when only a small pressing force is required, it is possible to operate with a smaller force of longer stroke, by providing bevelled punches or by reducing the cross section for outflow of material. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same can be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example only, to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 shows a graph of energy Eg plotted against time T in a pressing operation embodying this invention and a corresponding graph parallel thereto of energy EAK plotted against time T to show the changes in energy accumulation in the elastically deformable member with passage of time FIGURE 2 is a graph showing force Q plotted against stroke H of the working tool of a device embodying the invention FIGURE 3 shows in longitudinal cross section a typical working tool in use for the punching of a workpiece in accordance with the method of the invention FIGURE 4 shows the kinematic diagram of one form of press apparatus of vertical layout embodying this invention FIGURE 5 shows the kinematic diagram of an alternative form of press apparatus embodying this invention FIGURE 6 shows to an enlarged scale the arrangement of powered cam and auxiliary cam of the apparatus shown inFigure 5 FIGURE 7 shows a form of working tool to be used in apparatus according to this invention in the injection moulding of plastics material and FIGURE 8 shows force diagrams indicating the change in the relationship between force Q4 in relation to deformation H4 for the elastically deformable member during energy input and of force Q7 in relation to power strokeH7 during energy release from the elastically deformable member. Referring first to Figure 1, the continuous supply of energy to a workpiece in accordance with the present invention can be seen to take the following form. For a short time interval T1 during operation of the press, there is transmitted to a workpiece by an elastically deformable member the given amount of energy E. There then follows a time interval T2 of relatively long duration during which there is transmitted to the workpiece a small amount of energy by means of an auxiliary drive, while at the same time there is accumulated in the elastically deformable member at the expense of the main drive a new quantity of energy EAK which in the next following time interval T1 is transmitted in its turn to the work piece, and so forth.After the time interval T1 concluding the press working, there may then be a time interval T2 during which auxiliary operations occur without energy release. Figure 2 shows the form of the power stroke of the working member of the press for maintaining a constant pressing force Q in accordance with the present invention using a working device for example of the type shown inFigure 3. It can be seen that the power stroke H is composed of sectors H1 which take place during the time intervals T1 at great energy release at the expense of the elastically deformable member and of sectors H2 which take place during the intermediate time interval T2 at low speeds and at low energy release at the expense of the auxiliary drive. There then follows an opening auxiliary reverse stroke Ho during which the force Q undergoes magnitude reduction and sign reversal and during which eventually a pause for replacement of workpiece or material to be worked will occur.This is followed in turn by a direct auxiliary closing stroke H3. The extent of pressing during sectors H1, H2 and overall during total pressingH can be appreciated from Figure 3 in which the workpiece is denoted by the reference letter a, a punch by the reference letter b and a support for the workpiece by the reference letter c. Material being punched out enters an opening d in the support. A press apparatus operable according to the invention is shown in detail in Figure 4. The press comprises one or more low inertia motors each having a gear not shown for driving a power cam 2 which is in contact with a roll 1 attached to a quaternary lever 3 which is also hinge connected to a rigid support, that is a base 6 and to an elasticallydeformable member 9 which can be a rod in tension. At its fourth point 7, the lever 3 is connected to a member for connecting it to a unit 14,18 capable of reciprocating motion and carrying the displaceable part 19 of a working tool.The power cam 2 has at least one sector for achieving energy accumulation in the elastically deformable member 9 when its shaft is for example subject to constant torque and one sector for release of energy from the elastically deformable member in accordance with a predetermined relationship between space and time parameters associated with the construction and working of the apparatus. The member for joining the fourth point 7 of the lever 3 to the unit 14,18 isahinged connecting rod 10,13.The mutual arrangement of the hinge joints of the quaternary lever 3 respectively with the rigid support 6, the elastically deformable member 9 and the hi ed connecting rod 10,13 is such that the quaternary lever 3 is a functional force varying member, and the hinged connecting rod 10,13 is formed of first and second hinge connected semi rods 10 and 13, a hinge 11 being disposed between semi rod 10 and semi rod 13 and being shaped as a nut connected to a driving screw 12 driven by an auxiliary motor 8 with appropriate gears. Operation of the motor 8 is capable of regulation in accordance with the aforementioned space J time relationship. The force transmitting function of the quaternary lever 3 is determinable by the choice and mutual arrangement of the hinges 4, 6 and 7 of the quaternary lever. The angle between the initial position of the hinge 7, the rigid support 6 and a hinge 17 at which the hinged connecting rod 10, 13 is attached to the unit 14,18 is less than 0 90 but greater than the angle executed by the quaternary lever 3 in undergoing reciprocating motion while the angle between the hinge 4, the rigid support 6 and the point 21 of attachment of the elastically deformable member 9 to a rigid support is greater than the angle executed by the quaternary lever 3 in undergoing reciprocating motion. The unit carrying the working tool part 19 is a two part unit, comprising a component 18 connected to a component 14 by means of a driving screw 16 incorporating a nut and connected by an auxiliary motor 15 with appropriate reduction gear not shown . This motor is also capable of operation in connection with a space time relationship as aforementioned. There can, as shown, be more than one set of quaternary levers 3, elastically deformable members 9 and hinged connecting rods 10,13. The sets can be arranged symmetrically and can be provided with a common drive 8. The screws 12 can be of left hand and right hand thread. A press apparatus embodying this invention which includes a single set of quaternary lever 3 etc. is shown in Figure 5. This apparatus is constructed as an open frame machine with one elastically deformable member 9, one quaternary lever 3 and one power cam 2. The crank hinge 11 of the semi rods 10 and 13 is in this case a cylindrical hinge connected at one end to a transverse lever 22 which at its other end is connected to a driving rocking lever 23. This lever 23 is supported by an adjustable hinge support 24 which can be displaced along a plane 32 which is parallel to the position of the driving lever 23 in its end position when the connecting rod 10,13 is straight.The support 24 is provided with a lock 33 for positioning it adjacent the plane 32 and for adjusting the magnitude of the limit angle of the hinged connecting rodsl0,13 at their point of hinge connection with the working member 14 to achieve a different degree of opening of the working tool part 19.The rocking lever 23 carries at its other end an auxiliary roll 25 which is forced into contact with an auxiliary cam 26 which is either shaped as an internal auxiliary groove of the power cam 2 or is mounted for synchronous motion therewith. The power cam 2 is in contact at its outside with the main roll 1 which is attached to a pull lever 34 which is connected at its other end to the quaternary lever 3. The main roll 1 is connected by an extension of the pull lever 34 to an additional roll 36 guided along a rigid guideway to ensure that any unnecessary degree of freedom of the main roll 1 is avoided.In the upper part 14 of the two part reciprocating unit, there is mounted a motor 15 with appropriate reduction gear not shown and whose operation may be programmed as aforesaid for driving the screw mechanism 16 for varying the distance between the upper part 14 and the bottom part 18 of the unit carrying the tool part 19. The power cam of Figure 5 is illustrated separately in Figure 6. The auxiliary cam 26 can be seen to have a sector 28 of decreasing radius from a maximum to a minimum value followed by another sector 27 with increasing radius from a minimum to a maximum value. A sector 29 of the power cam 2 corresponds in phase and size to these two sectors, the sector 29 having a radius which increases according to a predetermined relationship and may be termed the sector for accumulation of potential energy in the elastically deformable member in accordance with this relationship. The auxiliary cam 26 also has a final sector 30 of constant radius which may be called the arc of rest. A final sector 31 of the power cam corresponds to this sector in size and phase and is of decreasing radius according to another predetermined relationship.This sector may be called the sector for energy release by the elastically deformable member 9 connected to the hinged connecting rod 10,13. The operation of apparatus in accordance with the method of the invention will now be described as follows With the apparatus of Figure 4, the low inertia motor 5 causes the power cam to rotate so that the roll 1 climbs up in the energy accumulating sector. This causes the elastically deformable members 9 to be stretched and potential energy to be accumulated in them. At the same time, the auxiliary motor 8 drives the screw 12 with left hand and right hand threads so that the nutted hinges 11 of the connecting rods approach each other and the unit 14,18 is drawn upwards. This phase of operation corresponds to the opening of the parts 19 and 20 of the working tool. If there is no automatic supply of material to be worked, it is possible to halt operation by switching off the motors 5 and 8 for example for replacement of work pieces.If pressing is to be effected, the auxiliary motor 8 is reversed and the tool is closed for as long as further energy accumulation in the elastically deformable members 9 takes place. After the performance of this opening stroke Eo see Figures 2 and 3 and the closing stroke H3, there follows the power stroke H1 in time interval T1 during which the power cam rotates with its release sector towards the roll 1.This sector of the power cam is shaped in accordance with a predetermined relationship for energy release and causes the quaternary lever 3 to rotate in opposite directions under the action of the elastically deformable members 9 which are being shortened, and the force exerted by the levers 3 is transmitted by means of the hinged connecting rods 10,13 to the upper component 14 of the unit carrying the part 19 of the working tool. During this time, the motor 8 can be switched off. The tool 19 performs a power strokeH1 towards the workpiece. If this stroke is not sufficient to achieve the desired press working, then the programme control device not shown in the drawings gives commands to the motors 5 and 8 to be operated so that a new amount of energy is accumulated in the elastically deformable members 9. For this purpose, the points 7 of attachment of the hinged connecting rods 10,13 to the quaternary levers 3 climb upwards under the action of the auxiliary motor 8 with gear and drive screw 12 with left hand and right hand threads to enable further energy accumulation in the members 9 to occur and in the meanwhile the unit 14,18 drives the moveable part 19 of the tool further into the workpiece at a very low creeping speed to an additional depth H2 during the prolonged time interval T2. Hence, pressing of the tool does not stop when the energy in the members 9 has been expended and no harmful effect due to increase in the coefficient of friction between the tool and the workpiece at rest as compared to the coefficient of friction with the workpiece in motion can occur.On command from the programme control device, there then follows a new power stroke H1 driven by the elastically deformable member 9, a new short stroke H2 and so on until the processing of the workpiece is complete. The programme control device receives information for the different parameters of the production process from respective transducers which are not shown in the drawings and can also be set eventually to operate according to predetermined programmes. In principle, the creeping speeds during the energy accumulating time interval T2 can also be achieved by means of the auxiliary motor 15 with its reduction gear and the driving screw 16 operating to achieve relative movement of the components 14 and 18 of the two part reciprocating unit.In the general case, however, the latter mechanism is used for adjustment purposes only, that is for the adjustment of the closed height of the apparatus and will depend upon the height of the working tools employed. The operation of the press apparatus shown in Figures 5 and 6 is similar in principle to that of the press apparatus of Figure 4. The cams are shown in Figure 5 in the position they occupy when the auxiliary closing strokeH3 is ending and the power stroke H1 is imminent, that is the hinged connecting rods 10,13 are in a straight line.At this stage, the tool 19 almost touches the workpiece material the illustrated tool is a punching tool to act on sheet material . During the time interval T1, the main roll I acts on the release sector 31 of the power cam 2 in the illustrated example the direction of rotation of the power cam is clockwise because of the shortening of the elastically deformable member 9 a rod accompanied by the release of the accumulated energy as the hinges 4, 7 and 11 and unit 14 descend, the latter causing a displacement H1. At the same time, the auxiliary roll 25 rolls over the arc of rest, that is the sector 30, of the auxiliary cam 26. At this stage, however, the rocking lever 23 and the transverse lever 22 are incapable of movement.During the next following time interval T2, the auxiliary roll 25 moves over the sector 28 of the auxiliary cam 26, the rocking lever 23 rotates about its support 24 and displaces the transverse lever 22 to the left together with the crank hinge 11 and the upper part 14 of the unit carrying the working member 19 is raised.During this time, the main motor 5 operates as the main roll 1 rolls over the accumulating sector 29 of the power cam 2 and potential energy is accumulated in the elastically deformable member 9, while the auxiliary motor 15 is controlled by the programme control device so that not only does the bottom part 18 of the two part working unit not move upwards, but the tool 19 continues to penetrate into the material at creeping speed, The auxiliary roll 25 then begins to move away from the axis of the auxiliary cam 26 over the sector 27, the semi rods 10,13 are again in line, the upper part 14 moves downwards, the auxiliary motor 15 is reversed and the distance between the parts 14 and 18 is reduced, while the tool 19 continues to penetrate the material being worked at creeping speed and the main roll 1 continues to roll over the accumulating sector 29.The process is repeated as many times as necessary for completion of the punching it is assumed that the sheet material is thick and the punch is bevelled thereby requiring repeated operation of the apparatus .At the end of operation, the auxiliary motor 15 operates so that parts 14 and 18 approach each other, while the auxiliary roll 25 rolls over the opening sector 28 and the auxiliary stroke Ho is effected after which new material is supplied, with or without stopping the press apparatus at the end of this stroke. There then follows a new closing of the tool by carrying out auxiliary stroke H3, while the roll 25 rolls over the closing sector 27. It should be noted that when working a thin material, if the energy storable in the elastically deformable member 9 is sufficient for effecting the punching during one revolution of the cams 2 and 26, then it is not necessary to apply the aforementioned working method in full and the auxiliary motor 15 may be switched off. This motor is usually to be used only for setting purposes when the tools 19 are of different height and the auxiliary strokes for opening HO and closing H3 are effected only by the kinematic members auxiliary cam 26, auxiliary roll 25, rocking lever 23, transverse lever 22 and crank hinge 11.The magnitude of these auxiliary strokes is determined in this case only by the position in which the support 24 is locked by means of its lock 33 with respect to the plane 32 which is oriented so that, regardless of its position, the final position of the crank hinge always rernains the same, being the position at which the roll 26 rolls over the sector of rest, that is the sector 30 of the auxiliary cam, for the purpose of effecting the power stroke at the then immovable rocking lever 23. The lower the adjustable support 24 is fastened, the more the semi rods move out of alignment at the hinge connection 11 and the more the tool is opened. This is appropriate when working on workpieces of large volume, for example for the ribbing of sheet metal components.However, then the main motor 5 will be operated more slowly to facilitate the operation of the auxiliary motor 15. With the type of working tools shown in Figure 7, this being part of an apparatus for injection moulding of plastics, the moveable part 19 of the working tool is shaped as a ram which forces the material through cylinders surrounded by heaters which are not shown in the drawing into a tool part 20 which is here a mould. If the energy of the elastically deformable member 9 is sufficient for filling the mould 20 with material, there should then follow an opening stroke and replacement of the filled mould below the tool 19 by a new empty mould 20. Otherwise the filling must be carried out in several subsequent steps according to the described method. If it is necessary to maintain the mould 20 with the moulded article under pressure for a given time, for example for additional heat treatment of the article within the mould, then motors 5 and 8 are switched off during this time and pressure is supplied by the stress in the elastically deformable members 9. The afore described arrangement of the hinges of the quaternary levers 3 ensures that, during the energy release interval T1, the projections of the hinges 4 on the horizontal plane passing through the rigid supports, that is the bases 6, move away from these hinged supports. The components of the forces with which the elastically deformable members 9 seek to rotate the quaternary levers downwards increases, while these forces are decreasing. At the same time, the hinges 7 by which the quaternary levers 3 transmit the working force to the hinged connecting rods 10,13 are moved closer to the hinge supports 6.Thus, despite the fact that during the energy release time interval T1 the impact function of the hinge 4 is increasing see the relationship between force Q4 and deformation H4 in Figure 8 , the output function of the quaternary lever on its hinge 7 see the relationship between force Q7 and stroke H7 in Figure 8 can be either constant or of increasing character. This is a favourable factor when carrying out many production processes. This property of the quaternary lever is also a pre requisite for the operation of the apparatus shown inFigure 4 as well as that shown in Figures 5 and 6, during the time interval T2. With the apparatus of Figure 4, the tool part 19 then penetrates into the workpiece up to a small depth at low speed and with small energy expenditure at the expense of the auxiliary drive, while the hinges 7 are subjected to the normal working force. However, the auxiliary motors do not help the main motors just because of the functional features of the thus described quaternary levers 3. This can happen only if the reverse force becomes greater than the limit Q7 in the upper part of the diagram shown in Figure 8 and this is controlled by the programme control device.
