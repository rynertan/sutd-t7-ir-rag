# Position and speed sensors.

## Abstract
In a sensor having a drive winding 121 for establishing a forward field, an electrically conductive screen 123 is displaceable relative to a sense winding 122 . In the presence of the drive field, eddy currents are generated in the screen to establish a counter field opposing the forward field, so that the sense winding is shaded by the screen to a varying extent during relative displacement of screen and sense winding and the voltage induced in the sense winding is accordingly correspondingly varied. Application of a high frequency input to the drive winding 121 results in a mod ulated output from the sense winding 122 which may be demodulated to provide a signal indicative of screen posi tion relative to sense winding. The position signal may be further processed to provide a speed signal. The sensor may assume a multiplicity of linear or planar, rotational and axial or solenoidal configurations.
