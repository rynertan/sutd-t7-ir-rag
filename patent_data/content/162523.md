# Organic polymer stabilisation.

## Abstract
Reactive stabilising compounds, able to stabilise organic polymers, contain in their molecule a sterically hindered amino group and a hydrolysable silyl function. In stabilising organic polymers, said reactive stabilising compounds can be hydrolysed at the silyl function with the formation of silanol groups, which are made to interact in order to form complex resinous stabilising structures. These latter are added in stabilising quantities to the polymer to be stabilised. According to one particular embodiment, the hydrolysis at the silyl function and the formation of the resinous struc ture take place spontaneously within the polymer to be sta bilised. According to a further embodiment, the reactive stabi lising compound is added to the polymer after being stably supported on a solid support by reaction with an inorganic solid having surface hydroxyl groups. According to a further embodiment, the reactive stabi lising compound is made to interact with the polymer so that the stabilising compound becomes chemically bonded to the polymer chains. In all cases, stabilised polymers are obtained containing the stabilising compound in a form which is not removable from the polymer. The process for preparing the reactive stabilising com pounds and for preparing the stabilised polymer composi tions are also described.
