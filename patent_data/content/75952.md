## Description
HYDROGENOLYSIS PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF MONOETHYLENc LYCOL MONOMETHYL ETHER, MONOETHYLENE GLYCOL AND ETHANOL Brief Summary of the InventionTechnical Field This invention is directed to the production of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol at significantly high production rates by the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol. The polyalkylene glycol is selectively cleaved af a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing ruthenium to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol.The production rate of each of said monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol is at least about 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour.Background Art It is known that monoethylene glycol is commercially produced by the hydrolysis of ethylene oxide which in turn is generated by the oxidation of ethylene, typically by the reaction of ethylene and oxygen over a silver containing catalyst. Other processes noncommercial for making monoethylene glycol involve reactions of carbon monoxide with hydrogen or formaldehyde, typically in the presence of a certain precious metal catalyst. Major by products of the commercial oxide glycol process are diethylene glycol and higher polyalkylene glycols in amounts up to 10 percent by weight of the total product mixture. However, diethylene glycol may or may not be a commercially desirable by product. For instance, considerably more diethylene glycol by product may be produced from the commercial oxide glycol process than can be utilized profitably.In those instances where the production of diethylene glycol is commercially undesirable, any process capable of efficiently converting this by product to monothylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol, ethanol or other valuable products at preferably high production rates would be highly desirable. It has been found as a result of the present invention that polyalkylene glycols, e.g., diethylene glycol, can be selectively cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating the polyalkylene glycol with molecular hydrogen In the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing ruthenium to product at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. The production rate of each of said monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether1 monoethylene glycol and ethanol is at least about 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour.

In copending USSN 307,226 of September 30, 1981 there is described the ma Eacture of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol by the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol. The polyalkylene glycol is selectively cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising nickel to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. Monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether can be produced in predominant amounts by employing the process disclosed in this copending application. Copending USSN 307,224 ofSeptember 30, 1981 describes a process for selectively cleaving a polyalkylene glycol, e.g. diethylene glycol, at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising iridium to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. Monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether can be produced in significant amounts by employing the process disclosed in this copending application. In copending USS 307, 210 oaeptember 30, 1981 is described the manufacture of monoethylene glycol and ethanol by the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol. The polyalkylene glycol is cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, e,g., copper chromite, to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol and ethanol. It has been suprisingly found as a result of the present invention that when a composition containing ruthenium is used as the hydrogenation catalyst in a process for hydrogenolyzing polyalkylene glycols, each of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol is formed at a production rate of at least about 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. This exceptipnat production rate is sufficiently high to be of commercial interest. By employing the hydrogenolysis process of the instant invention, significant amounts of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol may be produced in a given time period relative to the small amount of active metal, i.e., ruthenium, employed in the hydrogenation catalyst.The economic advantages in terms of the cost of the relatively small amounts of active metal, i.e., ruthenium, required for the hydrogenation catalyst to achieve the given reaction at exceptional production rates are readily apparent. Detailed Description Hydrogenolysis of polyalkylene glycols may proceed according to different cleavage pathways.For example, as illustrated in the present invention, polyalkylene glycols may be cleaved at either a carbon to oxygen covalent bond or a carbon to carbon covalent bond to give different products. The cleavage pathways are influenced or varied, to a certain extent, by choice of hydrogenation catalyst, concentration of active metal in hydrogenation catalyst, pressure provided by molecular hydrogen and other factors. When a hydrogenation catalyst containing ruthenium is used in the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol, according to the present invention, the cleavage pathway may be about equally directed toward a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently toward a carbon to carbon covalent bond resulting in the production of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, and monoethylene glycol in near equimolar amounts and ethanol In lesser amounts.However, by varying the concentration of active metal, i.e., ruthenium, in the hydrogenation catalyst and or varying certain reaction conditions, e.g., pressure resulting from molecular hydrogen, temperature, etc., the cleavage pathway may be predominantly directed toward either a carbon to oxygen covalent bond or a carbon to carbon covalent bond to give monoethylene glycol ethanol in predominant amounts or monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether in predominant amounts respectively. As a preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol is produced from the hydrogenolysis or cleaving of a polyalkykene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol. The production rate of each of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol is at least bout 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. The preferred hydrogenation catalysts which can be used to catalyze the hydrogenolysis process of this invention are well known in the art and include compositions containing ruthenium. The preferred hydrogenation catalysts may also include, as an additfonal ingredient, a promoter or promoters for increasing the activity of the hydrogenation catalysts. Suitable catalyst promoters may include barium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, strontium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, potassium, lithium, sodium, rubidium, cesium, molybdenum, chromium, tungsten, zinc and the like. Certain metals such as copper, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, iron, cobalt, nickel, rhodium, palladium, plat inum, iridium, rhenium, tantalum, vanadium, niobium, zinc and the like may act as co catalysts in combination with ruthenium.It is noted that molybdenum, chromium, tungsten and zinc may act as either a co catalyst or promoter. Reference to the hydrogenation catalysts, promoters and co catalysts as containing the above described metals is meant to include the metal in the compound form as well as the elemental form, for example as a metal oxide or sulfide or as a metal hydride, or as the reduced elemental metal or as mixtures of the foregoing.The hydrogenation catalysts may be employed in the presence or absence of a catalyst support. Suitable catalyst supports include silica gel, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, titanium dioxide, magnesium aluminate, zirconium dioxide, silicon carbide, ceramic, pumice, carbon, diatomaceous earth, kieselguhr and the like. Illustrative of the preferred hydrogenation catalysts useful in the process of this invention include compositions containing ruthenium on a suitable catalyst support, e.g., ruthenium on carbon, ruthenium on magnesium oxide, ruthenium on silica gel, ruthenium on titanium dioxide, ruthenium on aluminum oxide and the like. The compositions containing oxides may be totally or partially reduced in situ during reacKoF heat up.The most preferred hydrogenation catalysts of this invention include compositions containing about 5 percent by weight ruthenium on a suitable catalyst support. Many of the above described hydrogenation catalysts are commercially available and others are prepared by known methods detailed hereinbelow. The hydrogenation catalysts useful in the process of this invention can be employed Sn any form. They may be present in the reaction mixture as finely divided powders, porous tablets, pellets, spheres, granules and the like. It is desirable that the hydrogenation catalysts possess a high surface area to provide preferred reaction rates.The preferred surface area ranges from about 0.5 m2 gm to about 400 m2 gm and even greater. Most preferably, the surface area of the hydrogenation catalysts ranges from about 10 m2 gm to about 400 m2 gm. The average pore diameter of the hydrogenation catalysts is not narrowly critical. Hydrogen diffusion appears to be rate limiting in catalysts having very small pores. It also appears that a very small average pore diameter and or a large catalyst particle diameter are detrimental to high monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether monoethylene glycol ethanol selectivities and or polyalkylene glycol conversion rates. In general, for obtaining desirable monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether monoethylene glycol ethanol selectivities, it is believed that catalysts having 15 nin o an average pore diameter of at least about 150 A, 25 nm preferably at least about 250 A, and a particle diameter of less than 10 millimeters, preferably 5 millimeters or less, are useful in the hydrogenolysis process of this invention. The quantity of the hydrogenation catalyst which is employed is not narrowly critical and can vary over a wide range. In general, the process of this invention is desirably conducted either continuously or batchwise in the presence of a catalytically effective quantity of the hydrogenation catalyst which gives a production rate for each of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol of at least about 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. The reaction proceeds when one employs as little as about 501 weight percent, or even a lesser amount of catalyst based on the total quantity of the reaction mixture under batch conditions. The upper concentration of the hydrogenation catalyst can be quite high, e.g., about 50 weight percent of catalyst based on the total quantity of reaction mixture.Higher concentrations may be used if desired. However, the upper concentration appears to be dictated by economics in terms of the cost of certain hydrogenation catalysts to achieve the given reaction and by ease of handling of the reaction mixture during the course of the reaction.Depending on various factors, such as the total operative pressure of the system, the operative temperature and other considerations, a concentration of between about 0.1 and about 30 weight percent hydrogenation catalyst based on the total quantity of the reaction mixture is generally suitable in the practice of this invention. The preferred polyalkylene glycols which can be used in the practice of the process of this invention are well known in the art and include diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol and the like. In the most preferred embodiment of this invention, diethylene glycol formed as a by product of the commercial axide glycol process described hereinabove, is selectively cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing ruthenium to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. The production rate of each of said monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol is at least about 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. By utilizing the preferred catalysts and reaction conditions of the present Invention, higher polyalkylene glycols such as triethylene glycol and tetraethylene glycol may be selectively cleaved to give at least one of monoethytene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol at a production rate for each of at least 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. These polyalkylene glycols are prepared by methods well known in the art. The relative amounts of polyalkylene glycol and molecular hydrogen which are initially present in the reaction mixture can be varied over a wide range. In general, the molar ratio of molecular hydrogen to polyaltylene glycol is in the range of between about 1 20 to about 2000 1, preferably between about 1 2 and about 500 1 and most preferably, between 1 1 and about 200 1. It is to be understood, however, that molar ratios outside the stated broad range may be employed. However, very high molecular hydrogen to polyalkylene glycol molar ratios are economically unattractive, and very low molecular hydrogen to polyalkylene glycol molar ratios will result generally in low conversions and lower product selectivities.When operating in the continuous mode, molecular hydrogen and polyalkylene glycol may be fed either concurrently or countercurrently over the hydrogenation catalyst using either upward, downward or horizontal flow with concurrent downward flow being preferred. The gas hourly space velocity GHSV of molecular hydrogen and the liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of polyalkylene glycol may be varied over a wide range utilizing the continuous process.The gas hourly space velocity of molecular hydrogen may range from about 100 hr 1 or less to greater than 100,000 hr , preferably from about 1,000 hr 1 to about 100,000 hr 1, and most preferably from about 2,000 her 1 to about 75,000 hr The liquid hourly space velocity of polyalkylene glycol may range from about0.01 hr 1 or less to about 100 hr 1 or greater, preferably from about Q.1 hr 1 to about 25 hr 1, and most preferably from about 0,25 hr 1 to about 10 her 1. The higher GHSV and LHSV values generally tend to result in uneconomically low conversion of polyalkylene glycol, and the lower GHSV and LHSV values generally tend to decrease the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. The intended purpose is to provide a sufficient quantity of polyalkylene glycol and molecular hydrogen in the reaction mixture to effect the desired production of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol at a production rate for each of at least about 10 moles kjlogram ruthenium hour. The process of this invention can be effected over a wide temperature range. In general, the process is conducted at a temperature of between about 1250C and about 350etc. Lower temperatures generally give improved product selectivity, but often at undesirable low production rates. Higher temperatures generally increase total productivity but tend to increase by product formation.Operating the process at temperatures lower than 1250C will result in undesirably low production rates so that the reaction will typically be operated over an extended period of time and or excessive quantities of catalyst must be employed in order to obtain the desired production of reaction products. When operating the process at temperatures higher than 3500C there is a tendency for the organic materials contained in the reaction mixture to decompose. In most cases when operating at the lower end of the temperature range, it is desirable to utilize pressures in the higher end of the pressure range.The preferred temperature range is between about 1500C and 3O00C, while the most preferred temperature range is between about 1750C and 265 C. However, there are occasions when a preferred temperature range may include any of the more desirable ranges as well as the broadest range such that the process may be operated at a temperature of between 1500C and 3000C as well as between about 125 C and 325 C. The process of the present invention is effected under atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure conditions. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pressure is produced almost exclusively by the molecular hydrogen provided to the reaction. However, suitable inert gaseous diluents may also be employed if desired.Actual operating pressures initial pressures under batch operating conditions of between about 690 bar atmospheric and about 10,000 psig represent an operative limit for producing the monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol products. The preferred actual operating pressure conditions for the production of monoethelene glycol monomethvl ether ranee from 6,9 bar 276 bar about 100 osl to osia and. most 17.25 bar 138 bar preferably, from about 250 psig to about 2000 psig.When operating the process at lower pressures, the rate of production of the desired products becomes slower and therefore the reaction period must be extended until the desired amount of reaction products are produced. When operating the process at higher pressures, the rate of production of the desired products will be increased. Higher pressures generally tend to increase the selectivity to monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, but very high pressures can also increase by product formation through secondary hydrogenolysis reactions Lower pressures generally tend to increase the selectivity of monoethylene glycol and ethanol, increase the formation of by products such as 2 oxodioxane and decrease the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether. The process of this invention is effect1 for a period of time sufficient to produce the desired monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol at a production rate for each of at least about 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. In general, the reaction time can vary from a fraction of a second to several hours, i.e., from 0.1 second and shorter to approximately 10 hours, and longer. When operating the hydrogenolysis process of this invention undue continuous conditions, the reaction time or residence period may generally range from a fraction of a second to several minutes or more whereas the residence period under batch conditions may generally range from a few minutes to several hours. It is readily appreciated that the required residence period will be influenced by reaction temperature, concentration and choice of hydrogenation catalyst, total pressure, concentration molar ratio of polyalkylene glycol and molecular hydrogen and other factors. The synthesis of the desired products, i.e., monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol, from the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol is suitably conducted under operative conditions which give a production rate for each of at least 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. The process of this invention can be carried out in a batch, semi continuous or continuous manner in either a liquid phase, vapor phase or a combination liqu4d vapor phase. The reaction may be conducted in fixed bed, slurry phase, trickle bed or fluidized bed reactors or the like using a single reaction zone or a plurality of reaction zones, in series or in parallel. The reaction may be conducted intermittently or continuously in an elongated tubular zone or a series of such zones. The material of construction of the equipment should be such so as to be inert during the reaction. The equipment should also be able to withstand the reaction temperatures and pressures. The reaction zone can be fitted with internal and or external heat exchangers to control undue temperature fluctuations caused by the moderate exothermic nature of the reaction.In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, agitation means to ensure complete mixing of the reaction mixture should be used in reaction systems not employing a fixed bed catalyst. Mixing induced by magnetic stirrer, vibration, shaker, rotating, sparging with gas, oscillation, etc. are all i11ustrative of the types of agitation means which are contemplated herein.Such agitation means are available and well known to the art. The polyalkylene glycol, molecular hydrogen and hydrogenation catalyst ingredients may be initially introduced into the reaction zone batchwise. Alternatively, the polyalkylene glycol, molecular hydrogen and hydrogenation catalyst ingredients may be introduced into the reaction zone continuously or intermittently during the course of the synthesis reaction. Means to introduce the ingredients into the reaction zone during the course of the reaction and or means to adjust the ingredients in the reaction zone during the reaction1 either intermittently or continuously, can be conveniently utilized in the process to maintain the desired molar ratios of ingredients and to maintain the pressure exerted by hydrogen. The operative conditions of the present process may be adjusted to optimize the conversion rate of polyalkylene glycol, the selectivities and production rates of the desired products and or the economics of the process. For example, it may generally be preferred to operate at relatively low conversion rates, which tends to increase selectivities of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol and increase the monoethylene glycol ethanol molar ratio by reducing secondary hydrogenolysis reactions.Recovery of the desired monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol can be achieved by methods well known in the art, such as by distillation, fractionation, extraction, and the like. Typically, in carrying out the process, the product contained in the reaction mixture would be withdrawn from the reaction zone and distilled to recover the desired products . For reactors not employing a fixed bed catalyst, a fraction comprising the hydrogenation catalyst and products can be removed for recovery or regeneration of the catalyst. Fresh hydrogenation catalyst can be intermittently added to the reaction stream or it can be added directly to the reaction zone, to replenish any catalyst which is lost in the process.

After cooling, the dried support was covered with a solution ofRu CO 12 in a minimum of n pentane. The n pentane was evaporated over a 3 hour period by warming in a hot water bath with a stream of nitrogen slowly flowing through the system.The remaining solid material was then warmed for 1 hour under vacuum to remove the last traces of n pentane. The dried solid material was reduced with 100 percent hydrogen by heating to 3000C at a rate of 1000C per hour. After holding the temperature at 3000C for 2 hours, the system was then cooled to 80 C in hydrogen. The hydrogen was displaced with nitrogen and the catalyst cooled to room temperature. EXAMPLES 1 THROUGH 15 Examples 1 through 15 were conducted batchwise in a 300 milliliter stainless steel autoclave reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer in accordance with the following procedure. Prior to each of the examples the magnetic stirrer was disassembled and all components washed thoroughly to remove residual catalyst powder. All parts and internals of the reactor were similarly cleaned, rinsed with acetone and dried The reactor was charged with a mixture of 50 grams of diethylene glycol and 1 gram of a finely pulverized catalyst specifically identified for each example in Table I below. The reactor was charged with only 25 grams of diethylene glycol in Examples 4 and 5 and with 100 grams of diethylene glycol in Example 10.The catalyst charge in Example 5 was only 0.5 grams. The reactor was then sealed, purged twice with 500 psig of molecular hydrogen and, after pressure testing, charged with an initial amount of molecular hydrogen. The initial molecular hydrogen pressure for each example is given in Table I. The magnetic stirrer was started and adjusted to 1000 rpm, and the reaction system was then heated to a temptrature specified for each example in Table I. After a six hour reaction period the reactor was cooled, stirring was discontinued and the pressure vented slowly. The reaction period was only two hours forExample 5. During the venting step, a sample of product gas was collected for analysis by gas chromatography. The remaining liquid contents of the reactor were then removed, weighed and analyzed by gas chromatography. The performance of catalysts tested in Examples 1 through 15 is given in Table I.

Examples l through 15 illustrate the overall effectiveness of compositions containing ruthenium as the hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention. Compositions containing about 5 percent by weight ruthenium are the most preferred hydrogenation catalysts for use in the hydrogenolysis process of ths invent ion. When a composition containing ruthenium is used as the hydrogenation catalyst, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol are formed at a production rate for each of at least about 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. Examples 5 and 15 show exceptional production rates for monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol.In Example 5, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether is formed at a production rate of 942 moies kilogram ruthenium hour, monoethylene glycol is formed at a production rate of 668 moles kilogram ruthenium hour and ethanol is formed at a production rate of 40 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. In Example 15, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether is formed at a production rate of 940 moles kilogram ruthenium hour, monoethylene glycol is formed at a production rate of 460 moles kilogram ruthenium hour and ethanol is formed at a production rate of 180 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. These exceptional production rates are sufficiently high to be of highly desirable commercial interest.Significant amounts of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol are produced in a given time period relative to the small amount of active metal, i.e., ruthenium, employed in the hydrogenation catalyst by using the hydrogenolysis process of the instant invention. The economic advantages in terms of the cost of the relatively small amounts of active metal, i.e., ruthenium, required for the hydrogenation catalyst to achieve the given reaction at exceptional production rates are readily apparent. Examples 3, 4, 5 and 6 illustrate the effect of pressure on the hydrogenolysis reaction using the same hydrogenation catalyst, i.e., CatalYst I. and the same temperature. As can be be bay seen from Example 5, a pressure of about 1000 psig is desirable for obtaining overall preferable performance. The most preferred pressure fore monoethylene glycol monomethyl ethers, monoethylene glycol and ethanol formation at a production rate for each of at least about 10 moles kilogram 17,25 138 bar rutnenium nour ranges trom about 250 psig to about 2000 psig. Examples 6, 7, 8 and 9 illustrate the effect of temperature on the hydrogenolysis reaction using the same hydrogenation catalyst, i.e.,Catalyst I, and the same pressure. As can be seen from these examples, a temperature ranging from about 175 C to about 2500C is highly desirable for obtaining overall preferred performance. The most preferred temperature for the formation for each of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol at a production rate of at least about 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour ranges from about 175 C to about 2650C. Examples 10 through 15 illustrate the effect of other compositions containing ruthenium as the preferred hydrogenation catalyst utilized in the hydrogenolysis process of this invention.
