# Photographic silver halide materials comprising light absorbing dyes.

## Abstract
For absorbing light of the whole visible spectral region in a silver halide emulsion layer or in an antihalation layer of a photographic material it suffices to use a 2 pyrazolin 5 one pentamethine oxonol dye corresponding to the formula The dyes are used in dispersed form in at least one light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer or in an anti halation layer.
