## Abstract
A transmitter 2 generating a train of pulses arranged in groups of two, each group including a long pulse and a short pulse of different frequencies. These long and short pulses are separated in a receiver 3 by a range gate 12 which passes the pulses through the upper receiving channel when reflected from long ranges and the lower receiving channel when re ceived from short ranges. The upper channel includes a filter 19 which passes only the long pulses which are frequency swept . These pulses are compressed in a compressor net work 20 . The lower channel includes a filter 15 which passes only the short pulses which, in this particular embodiment, are not frequency swept. The transmitter 2 reverses the order of the pulses in adjacent groups. Alternatively, both the long and short pulses may all be frequency swept. In either event there are adjacent pairs of swept pulses in contrast to known systems in which each swept pulse has immediately been pre ceded or followed by an unswept pulse.
