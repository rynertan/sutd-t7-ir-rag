# TWO STAGE DIRECTIONAL CONTROL VALVES

## Abstract
A solenoid operated, two stage hydraulic spool valve comprising pilot valve means 22 and a main valve 2 with the pilot valve means comprising two control devices 24 associated with respective ends of the spool of the main valve, at least one control device comprising a solenoid and a pilot valve spool, in use each control device being operable physi cally to move the main valve spool 2 during an initial portion of the movement of the latter from a null position to an offset position in which hydraulic fluid is passed to a load, move ment of the main valve spool beyond said initial portion being effected hydraulically on opening of the pilot valve means the hydraulic spool valve further comprising means 36 37 for equalising the hydraulic pressure across each control device.
