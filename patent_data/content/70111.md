# Improved torque responsive fluid coupling device.

## Abstract
A fluid coupling device is disclosed which is basically of the torque responsive type. The fluid coupling includes a separator plate 31 to separate the fluid chamber into a working or operating chamber 33 and a reservoir chamber 35 . The separator plate is provided with a pumping element 47 , and disposed adjacent thereto is a fluid orifice 45 . When the coupling is operating in the low input speed range, the centrifugal force acting on the fluid in the reservoir generates a greater pressure in the region of the orifice 45 than does the pumping element 47 , thus resulting in flow of fluid from the reservoir to the working chamber through the fluid orifice As the slip speed of a coupling reaches the predetermined value, the pressure generated by the pump ing element is greater than that generated by centrifugal force, and fluid flows from the working chamber to the reservoir, thus achieving the disengaged condition of the coupling. If additional fill rate capability is needed, a secondary fill orifice 49 may be added.
