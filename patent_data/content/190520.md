# ELECTRICAL CONNECTION FOR ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS

## Abstract
An electrical connecting device for the temporary con nection of electrical or electronic circuits comprises a contact area 10 and a contactor device 20 . The contact area 10 has a plurality of concentric zones 11 of conductive material. Each zone 11 is isolated from the other and a first electrical or electronic circuit 16 is coupled to the conduc tive zones. The contactor device 20 has a plurality of contacts 32 so disposed that when the contactor device is located with the contact area 10 one or more contacts 32 can be bought into engagement with the conductive zones 11 of the contact area. A second electrical or electronic circuit is coupled to the contacts. The contact area 10 can be mounted with a suitable carrier C such as a label which can be attached to an animate or inanimate object to be identified. By placing the contactor 20 in engagement with the contact area 10 information can be read from or programmed into the first circuit 16 by a data processing device coupled to the contactor.
