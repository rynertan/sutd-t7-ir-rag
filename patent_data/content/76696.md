# A RESTRICTION ENZYME AND A METHOD FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF

## Abstract
A restriction enzyme having a specificity such that it can recognize a palindromic, hexanucleotide sequence 5 GGCGCC 3 , and can cleave the recognition sequence 5 GGCGCC 3 between the two C s at the 3 ends, so as thus to generate DNA fragments with tetranucleotide long 3 protruding ends, GCGC 3 . A method for production of this restriction enzyme employs strains belonging to Bifidobac terium breve, e.g. YIT 4006 having the Deposition No. FERM P3906.
