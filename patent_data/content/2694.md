# Radiation detector.

## Abstract
In a substrate 11 of semiconductor material of one conductivity type and high resistivity, a thin layer 13, 14 of the same conductivity and low resistivity is provided adjacent a major surface 15 of the substrate. A region 21 of opposite conductivity type is provided in the substrate adjacent the major surface to form a PN junction 22 therewith spaced adjacent to the thin layer. Zero bias is provided on the PN junction. Minority charge carriers generated in the semiconductor substrate underlying the thin layer in response to applied radiation diffuse to the region of opposite conductivity type and are sensed.
