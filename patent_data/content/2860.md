# Process for the removal of non converted monomers from a copolymer of acrylonitrile.

## Abstract
Process for the removal of unconverted monomers from a copolymer of acrylonitrile with one or more monomers copolymerizable therewith by a treatment with steam wherein a latex of said copolymer obtained from a polymerization stage is subjected to a continuous treatment with steam comprising atomizing said latex to form a gas liquid mixture consisting of latex droplets dispersed in a gasphase and passing the said gas liquid mixture through a gas liquid contacting device, the gasphase is separated from the mixture this gasphase is at least partially condensed, the condensate is separated into an organic and an aqueous phase the thus separated organic phase is returned to the polymerization stage, and the latex is further processed. This process is especially suitable to remove non converted monomers from latices of copolymers of Î± methyl styrene and acrylonitril or graft copolymers thereof on a rubbery polymer.
