## Description
VINYL CHLORIDE POLYMERS The invention relates to a process for the suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride with monomer soluble radical forming initiators and possibly in the presence of suspending agents to form vinyl chloride polymers with at least 70 wt vinyl chloride units having good processing characteristics. The suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride, optionally with monomers copolymerizable with it, is generally known and is carried out extensively on a technical scale. Liquid vinyl chloride is suspended in water and polymerized with monomer soluble radical forming initiators at temperatures between 30 OC and 80 OC. The polymerization takes place in the monomer drops. Customary initiators are lauryl peroxide, di 2 ethylhexyl peroxide dicarbonate, dialkylpercarbonates, particularly diisopropylpercarbonate, azo compound, particularly azo bis isobutyronitrile, sulphonyl peroxides, particularly acetylcyclohexanesulphonyl peroxide. Suspending agents are used to promote and to stabilize the distribution of monomer resp. monomers in the aqueous phase and to prevent the agglomeration of polymer particles during the polymerization.Customary suspending agents are gelatin, guar, gum arabic, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl alcohols, polymeric suspending agents based on maleic acid or acrylic acid, for instance copolymers of maleic acid and vinyl acetate, xanthene gum, polyacrylamide and copolymers of acrylamide and other monomers. It has been found that particle size, porosity and bulk density of the polymer, particularly of polyvinyl chloride, and consequently the processing characteristics too, can be influenced by the choice of the suspending agents. Particularly vinyl chloride polymers incorporating plasticizers have been found to show a definite influence of the suspending agents used in the polymerization. For the take up of plasticizers the polymer must have sufficient porosity. Usually the occurrence of so called fish eyes, these are ungelled particles, is less frequent as the porosity increases. Since the harmful properties of vinyl chloride are known, the requirements imposed for the removal thereof from the polymer have been increased continually. It has been found that the removal of vinyl chloride from the polymer is easier as the porosity increases. High porosity of the polymer is usually accompanied by a low bulk density. It has been found, however, that with a given porosity the bulk density varies. As the bulk density increases, the processability, particularly the throughput in extruders, improves. Therefore, the preparation of vinyl chloride polymers is aimed at, for which reason the bulk density at a certain desired porosity is as high as possible. Owing to the influence of the suspending agents on a range of polymer properties, the choice thereof is very important. Through the modification of suspending agents, and ever further, improvement of the properties of the polymer to be prepared is aimed at. It is known for this purpose to add to the customary primary suspending agent, which is understood to mean a water soluble suspending agent, a secondary suspending agent, which is understood to mean a suspending agent that does not dissolve in water. The results obtained are then far better than those obtained when just the primary suspending agent is used. Thus it is known from European patent specification 2861 that vinyl chloride polymers having good porosity, a large BET surface, a narrow particle size distribution, few fish eyes in processing and good plasticizer take up can be prepared by suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride, if so desired with monomers copolymerizable with it, with monomer soluble radical forming initiators, and in the presence of primary and secondary suspending agents by carrying out the polymerization in the presence of 0.005 0.5 part by weight of a primary suspending agent known per se per 100 parts by weight monomer and as secondary suspending agent 0.005 0.5 part by weight, per 100 parts by weight monomer, of a polyvinyl alcohol with a degree of polymerization of at least 250 and preferably at least 350 with a degree of solvolysis of 40 70 moles with a narrow distribution of the degree of hydrolysis.The primary suspending agent used is preferably a polyvinyl alcohol with a degree of solvolysis of 70 90 moles . The said polyvinyl alcohols, which are characterized by, inter alia, a certain degree of solvolysis, and which are used as suspending agents, are prepared by solvolysis of polyvinyl acetate, because polyvinyl alcohol cannot be prepared direct by polymerization of vinyl alcohol, which is tautomeric with acetaldehyde. In an aqueous or alcoholic medium polyvinyl acetate can be converted into polyvinyl alcohol with an acid or an alkali as catalyst. During hydrolysis in an aqueous medium acetic acid and during alcoholysis in an alcoholic medium an acetic ester is released. The term solvolysis comprises both conversions.The solvolysis may be complete, but also incomplete. An incompletely solvolyzed polyvinyl alcohol can be regarded as a copolymer of vinyl acetate and vinyl alcohol, but is in practice called polyvinyl alcohol, with the degree of hydrolysis, or rather the degree of solvolysis, being mentioned. The action of secondary suspending agents like polyvinyl alcohol with a degree of solvolysis of 40 70 moles , preferably 50 60 moles , and a narrow distribution of the degree of hydrolysis, is explained in European patent specification 2861 from the suspicion that this secondary suspending agent is forced into the interface of the vinyl chloride monomer and the water, in consequence of which it has a very favourable effect on the structure of the PVC to be formed. In the process according to the invention a result is achieved, quite unexpectedly better than that according to European pantent specification 2861, viz. a lower fish eye number as defined below.The invention relates to a process for preparing vinyl chloride polymers by suspension polymerization in a polymerization reactor of vinyl chloride, optionally in combination with at most 30 wt of one or more monomers copolymerizable therewith, with monomer soluble radicalforming initiators and optionally in the presence of primary suspending agents in a quantity of preferably 0.005 0.5 part by weight primary suspending agent per 100 parts by weight monomer, characterized in that, before or during the polymerization 0.01 0.5 part by weight of at least one polyvinyl ester with an average degree of solvolysis lower than 70 moles and preferably lower than 55 moles and particularly lower than 25 moles is supplied to the polymerization reactor per 100 parts by weight starting monomer, which polyvinyl ester is chosen from the polymeric vinyl esters of one or more aliphatic and or aromatic carboxylic acids with 3 20 C atoms per molecule possibly copolymerized with one or more other monomers, preferably chosen from unsaturated mono and dicarboxylic acids, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, fumaric acid an itaconic acid, or the alkylesters with 2 20 C atoms of the acids mentioned here above, preferably acrylates, methacrylates, crotonates, fumarates, itaconates, maleates, laurates, versatates or hydroxymonomers such as hydroxyethylacrylate and hydroxypropylacrylate, acrylamide, acrylamide derivatives, diacetone acrylamide, sulphonic acids and sulphonates, such as styrene sulphonic acid, sodium vinyl sulphonate and vinyl sulphonic acid, monoesters of alkyl diols, dienes such as butadiene, vinyl chloride and olefines with 1 20 C atoms per molecule such as ethylene, propylene and butene. Particularly suitable polyvinyl esters in the process according to the invention are polyvinyl benzoate and polyvinyl propionate. The polyvinyl esters used preferably have a molecular mass of 50,000 5,000,000. The said polyvinyl esters can be brought into the polymerization reactor in any suitable manner, for instance as dry substances or as alcoholic, particularly methanolic, solutions. Customary primary suspending agents are gelatin, polymeric suspending agents based on maleic acid or acrylic acid, for instance copolymers of maleic acid and vinyl acetate. Very suitable primary suspending agents are polyvinyl alcohols with a degree of solvolysis of 70 to 99 moles and cellulose derivatives, particularly hydroxypropyl cellulose, methylhydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxymethyl cellulose.Very suitable also are mixtures of said polyvinyl alcohols and or cellulose derivatives. The invention is further elucidated by the following non restrictive examples and comparative experiments.Example I An enamelled autoclave of 100 1 is filled with 26 kg vinyl chloride, 36.4 kg water, 15.6 g polyvinyl alcohol with an average degree of solvolysis of 79 moles X and a degree of polymerization of 1700 and 10.4 g of a polyvinyl propionate with an average degree of solvolysis lower than 25 moles D. While being stirred, the whole of it is heated to about 330 K and is kept at this temperature until the pressure in the auctoclave, which was about 950 kPa, falls to about 800kPa. The pressure is subsequently relieved and the polymerization is stopped. After that the polyvinyl chloride is separated off from the suspension and dried. Of this polyvinyl chloride the average particle size, the porosity, the bulk density, the volume resistance and the dry blend time are determined. The average particle size d is determined with the screen analysis method described by Rosin and Rammler in Kolloid Zeitschrift 67 1934 , pp. 16 26 and Chem Ing. Techn., 24 1942 , pp. 25 31. The porosity E is determined according to the mercury intru sion method at a pressure of 12 MPa. L.A. de Wit and J.J.F. Scholten, J.Cat. 36 1975 , pp. 36 47, give a general exposition of the theory of this method and Guyer, Bdhlen and Guyer, Helv. Chim. Acta 42 1959 , p.2103, describe an apparatus for measuring the porosity according to this method. The bulk density is determined according to ISO R60. The volume resistance is determined according to ASTER D 257. The dry blend time is determined by putting 50 parts by weight dioctyl phthalate, 100 parts by weight PVC and 5 parts by weight lead stabilizer in a Pechiney cup described in ISO R4574 at 23 C and subsequently bringing the contents of this Pchiney cup to 88 C and then determining the dry blend time in the manner described in ASTM D 2396 69. For the polyvinyl chloride a d of 149 pm, an E of 0.29 m3 kg, a bulk density of 440 kg m3, a volume resistance of 9 x 1013 Q cm and a dry blend time of 6.6 minutes are found.Example II Vinyl chloride is polymerized in a manner similar to that described in example I, except that 15.6 g of the said polyvinyl propionate is added.

In a manner similar to that described in example I, a d of 155 pii, an g of 0.29 x 10 3 m3 kg, a bulk density of 490 kg m3, a volume resistance of 3 x 1013 Q cm and a dry blend time of 7.0 minutes are found for the polyvinyl chloride.Comparative experiment C Vinyl chloride is polymerized in a manner similar to that described in example I, except that no polyvinyl propionate is added, but 41.6 g of a solution in 100 g methanol of 25 g of a polyvinyl alcohol with an average degree of solvolysis of 48 moles Z a product of the firm of Sigma commercially available under the name of Polivic S 202 . In a manner similar to that described in example I, a d of 155 n, and e of 0.29 x 10 3 m3 kg, a bulk density of 485 kg m3, a volume resistance of 3 x 1013 q cm and a dry blend time of 7.0 minutes are found for the polyvinyl chloride.The results of the examples and of the comparative experiments are shown in the table below.
