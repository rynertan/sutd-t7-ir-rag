# MEASURING PERFORMANCE OF REFLEX REFLECTORS

## Abstract
A photometer for testing reflex reflectors including a pho to diode light sensor 5 and measuring circuitry for measuring light reflected from the reflector under test 4 . A light source 1 is positioned adjacent one end of a fibre optic bundle 3 whose other end is directed at the reflector under test, and the reflected light is measured via another fibre optic bundle 7 which directs the light onto the photo diode 5 .
