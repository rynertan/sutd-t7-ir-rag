# Polyesteramide concrete.

## Abstract
Polymer concrete compositions are made from norbornyl modified unsaturated polyesteramide compositions. The curable concrete composition contains 2 to 20 percent by weight of the polyesteramide composition and 98 to 80 percent by weight of an aggregate such as sand, gravel, silica flour, etc. The polyesteramide composition contains norbornyl modified polyesteramide, ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as styrene with or without a vinyl reactive additive. The polyesteramide can be further modified to contain a copolymerized polyether polyol having a functionality of three or more, a copolymerized poly 2 alkyl 2 oxazoline or a copolymerized carboxylated rubber. The vinyl reactive additive can be a vinyl ester resin or a vinyl terminated urethane oligomer. When cured, the curable concrete composition gives a polymer concrete with better tensile and compressive strength with the advantage that the composition cures under water and in the presence of moisture.

## Description
POLYESTERAMIDE CONCRETE This invention relates to polyesteramide concrete wherein the matrix is a norbornyl modified unsaturated polyesteramide and the aggregate is sand or and gravel and other additives Polymer concretes are known using various polymers or resins with various aggregates. Examples of the known cureable resins are furan, unsaturated polyester, epoxy, and vinyl ester resins. Of the known systems, polyester concretes appear to be the most economical but they have deficiencies such as excessive shrinkage that can be improved. Dicyclopentadiene modified unsaturated polyester resin compositions are known from U.S. 4,228,251 to be useful to make resin concrete. Indanyl modified unsaturated polyester and polyesteramide resins are disclosed to be useful to make resin concrete in U.S. Application Serial Number 545,024, HYDROCARBON MODIFIED UNSATURATED POLYESTER OR POLYESTERAMIDE RESINS by R. E. Hefner, Jr. filed onOctober 24, 1983. The invention is broadly a cured and curable polymer concrete composition comprising from 2 to 20 percent by weight of a norbornyl modified unsaturated polyesteramide composition with from 98 to 80 percent by weight of an aggregate. The polyesteramide composition comprises a blend of from 20 to 80 percent by weight of a norbornyl modified unsaturated polyesteramide, from 20 to 80 percent by weight of one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers and from 0 to 60 percent by weight of a vinyl reactive additive. The norbornyl modified unsaturated polyesteramide can be further modified by copolymerizing polyols, poly 2 alkyl 2 oxazolines and carboxylated rubber therein. The invention resides in polyesteramide aggregate compositions which when cured with known catalyst systems result in a polymer concrete with better tensile and compressive strengths with the added advantage that the composition can bond to various substrates such as concrete, metal, or asphalt under water or in the presence of moisture. The polyesteramides.used in this invention have a esteramide chain and have at least one terminal norbornyl radical. The ester amide chain is composed of the polymerizate of a polyamine, a polyol and an cr,B unsaturated polycarboxylic acid. The polyamine is from the class of those having the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 are selected from hydrogen, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic radicals, or R1 and R2 when taken together with the remainder of the molecule form an aliphatic ring wherein R3 is a divalent organic radical selected from alkylene, ether linked alkylene, ether linked arylene, alkylene amino linked alkylene, alkylene amino linked cycloalkylene, cycloalkylene, polycycloalkylene, arylene, alkylarylene, bis alkyl cycloalkylene or bis alkyl polycycloalkylene. Typical diamines that are useful herein are ethylene diamine, propylene diamine, hexane 1,6 diamine, piperazine, 4,4 methylenebis cyclohexylamine , 2,2 bis 4 aminocyclohexyl propane, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether, bis aminomethyl norbornene, toluene diamine, bis amino methyl dicyclopentadiene and homopiperazine. Typical polyamines are aminoethylpiperazine and di ethylenetri amine. The polyol is from the class of those having the formula EO R4 OH wherein R4 is a divalent organic radical selected from alkylene, ether linked alkylene, ether linked arylene, cycloalkylene, polycycloaikylene, bis alkyl cycloalkylene, bis alkyl polycycloalkylene, and arylene. Mixtures of two or more of such polyols can be used. Representative of the useful polyols are the diols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, dicyclopentadiene dimethanol, bis hydroxymethyl norbornane, methyl cyclohexanedimethanol, and bis hydroxypropyl bisphenol A. In addition to the above polyols, polyether polyols having a functionality of three or more can be used so as to provide 1 50 percent by weight of the polyether polyols. Examples of useful polyether polyols are the ethoxylated and or propoxylated tri, tetra, penta or hexa hydroxy compounds such as glycerin, pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane, and sorbitol. wf desired, mixtures of the above multi functional polyols can be used. The ratio of polyamine to polyol can be varied within wide limits. That ratio is significantly related to the solubility of the modified polyesteramide in reactive diluents, such as styrene, which are commonly employed with polyesteramides for many applications. As a general rule, the amount of polyamine should not exceed about 1 3 the combined weight of the polyol and polyamine. The structure and size of the polyamine molecule will determine to a great extent the maximum amount of polyamine that can be used. The a,S unsaturated polycarboxylic acid is preferably maleic acid, fumaric acid, maleic anhydride or mixtures of those compounds. Such acids are readily available, have good reactivity with the polyol and polyamine, and result in products of good properties. Part of the a, unsaturated acid may be replaced with a saturated or aromatic polycarboxylic acid to vary the cross linking potential and physical properties of the modified polyesteramide. Such acids include the aliphatic acids such as adipic acid and the aromatic acids such as isophthalic acid. Replacement of part of the a, unsaturated acid with such acids is commonplace in the polyester art. Suitable selection of acid and amount to achieve a desired purpose will be known to the skilled worker and can be optimized with simple preliminary experiments. The total amount of acid varies as Åa function of the total polyol, polyamine and norbornyl functional ingredients used. The terminal group used to modify the polyesteramide is a norbornyl radical. Dicyclopentadiene is a most preferred norbornyl functional material to be employed in terminating one or both ends of the chain. Polycyclopentadiene i.e., DCPD oligomers or dicyclopentadiene monoalcohol are also preferred species.Norbornene itself can also be used. DCPD is sold commercially as a product of about 97 or greater percent purity. It is also sold as a C10 hydrocarbon concentrate prepared by dimerizing a crude C5 stream from the cracking of hydrocarbons as taught in U. S. Patent 3,557,239. A preferred DCPD source is one that is low in peroxides and hydroperoxides and in light hydrocarbons and residual cyclopentadiene. The concentrates have as the main reactive components from 70 to 90 percent by weight of ducyclopentadiene, and from 5 to 30 percent by weight of the mixed Diels Alder dimers of diolefins such as butadiene, cis and trans piperylene, isoprene, cyclopentadiene and methyl cyclopentadiene. The remainder of these concentrates generally comprise residual C5 hydrocarbons and oligomers of the above diolefins. Examples of some of the dimers which have been identified in these concentrates are the Diels Alder adducts of two moles of isoprene isoprene dimers , the adduct of cyclopentadiene and isoprene, the adduct of cyclopentadiene and piperylene, and the like. Either the C10 concentrate or the relatively pure DCPD may be employed in preparing the modified unsaturated polyesteramides. As is common in the unsaturated polyester art, the modified polyesteramides of this invention may be blended with a monomer that is compatible therewith.Typical of the vinyl monomers are the alkenyl aromatics, such as styrene, divinylbenzene or vinyltoluene.Acrylic monomers, although less preferred, may also be used separately or in conjunction with then vinyl monomer.Typical of the acrylic monomers are methylmethacrylate or dicyclopentadiene acrylate. Other useful vinyl monomers will be known to the skilled worker. The vinyl monomer, frequently called a reactive diluent, may be employed within a wide range of concentration of from 20 to 80 percent of diluent to 80 to 20 percent of the resin. The optimum amount will depend in large measure on the polyesteramide, the diluent and the properties desired in the uncured and the cured states.Reactive diluents are employed principally to adjust the viscosity of a resin blend to permit its facile use in a given fabrication procedure. The polyesteramides are curable by known catalyst systems. Peroxides, such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxides, can be used with or without known promoters, such as cobalt octoate or cobalt naphthenate, that function with such peroxides. Acyl peroxides, such as benzoyl peroxides can be used with or without promoters such as tertiary amines, including typically dimethyl aniline and N,N dimethyl p toluidine. The, concentrations of catalyst and promoter are adjusted within known limits of from 0.1 to 3.0 weight percent depending on the rate of cure desired, the magnitude of the generated exotherm and for other known purposes.Known gelation retarding agents, such as p benzoquinone, can be employed in the curing system. The foregoing norbornyl modified unsaturated polyesteramides are described in U.S. Patent No.4,410,686. The above polyesteramides can be further modified by copolymerizing into the polyesteramide chain poly 2 alkyl 2 oxazolines . These polyoxazolines are used in amounts of from 0.01 to 2.0 percent by weight based on the polyesteramide and preferably from 0.10 to 1.0 percent by weight. The polyoxazoline modified polyesteramides are disclosed and claimed inU.S. Application Serial Number 452,583 filed December 23, 982. Still further, the above polyesteramides can be modified by incorporating from 0.5 to 20.0 percent by weight and preferably from 3.0 to 12.0 percent by weight of a carboxylated rubber into the polyesteramide chain. The preparation of these rubber modified polyesteramides is set forth hereinafter. The modified polyesteramides can be blended or mixed with from 0 to 60 percent by weight of a vinyl reactive additive such as a vinyl ester resin or mixtures thereof or vinyl terminated urethane oligomers. When the vinyl reactive additive is a vinyl ester resin or a mixture thereof, it can be used in an amount of from 1 to 60 percent by weight and preferably from 5 to 40 percent by weight. Blends of polyesteramides and vinyl ester resins are disclosed in U.S. Application Serial Number 411,178 filed August 25, 1982. When the vinyl reactive additive is a vinyl terminated urethane oligomer, it can be used in an amount of from 1 to 15 percent by weight and preferably from 3 to 10 percent by weight. The vinyl terminated urethane oligomers and polyesteramides containing them are disclosed in U.S.Application Serial Number 502,869 filed June 9, 1983. Polymer concrete is a composition made by blending of a curable resin component and an aggregate component. The polymer concrete composition of the present invention is prepared by blending from 2 to 20 percent by weight of a polyesteramide composition with from 98 to 80 percent by weight of an aggregate component.The aggregate component is typically sand, gravel, crushed stone or rock, silica flour, fly ash, and the like, or mixtures thereof. Up to about 50 percent by weight of metal fines, glass fibers, synthetic fibers, glass reinforcing mats, metal turnings, metal fibers, hydrated alumina, ceramic beads and the like, or mixtures thereof may be present in the aggregate composition.The exact components used in the aggregate composition are generally dictated by the physical properties required of the cured polymer concrete composition.Thus, optimal aggregate particle size distribution and physical configuration can be determined by simple preliminary experiments. The polymer concrete of the present invention is especially suited for use in repair of stalled, cracked or otherwise damaged concrete highways and bridges because of its low shrinkage upon curing, high mechanical strength,. excellent adhesion to concrete and aggregate and ability to adhere to wet concrete surfaces. The polymer concrete of the present invention is also well suited for use as an electrical insulating material, for example in the preparation of tough, highly moisture and impact resistant electrical powerline insulators. The unsaturated polyesteramide aggregate blends or mixtures are curable by known catalyst systems.Peroxides, such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxides, can be used with or without known promoters, such as cobalt octoate or cobalt naphthenate, that function with such peroxides. Acyl peroxides, such as benzoyl peroxides can be used with or without promoters such as tertiary amines, including typically dimethyl aniline andN,N dimethyl p toluidine, The concentrations of catalyst and promoter are adjusted within known limits of from 0.1 to 3.0 weight percent depending on the rate of cure desired, the magnitude of the generated exotherm and for Other known purposes. Known gelation retarding agents, such as p benzoquinone, can be employed in the curing system. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention.
