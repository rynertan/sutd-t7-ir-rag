# FRACTURING METHOD FOR STIMULATION OF WELLS

## Abstract
A subterranean formation is fractured using a stabilized foamed fracturing fluid comprising from about 50 percent to in excess of about 96 percent by volume of carbon dioxide, with the remainder comprising an aqueous liquid and a selected sur factant. The foam is formed in situ by injection of a stabilized liquid liquid emulsion containing liquid carbon dioxide, into a well bore penetrating the formation. The temperature and pres sure of the emulsion are controlled to maintain the carbon di oxide in the liquid phase during injection into the well bore. The reafter, the carbon dioxide is heated by the subterranean for mation to a temperature above about 88 F 31 C at which time the stabilized emulsion spontaneously forms a high qual ity stabilized foam.
