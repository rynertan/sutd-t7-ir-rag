## Description
SKIN TREATMENT COMPOSITION The invention relates to emulsions suitable for topical application to human skin. More particularly, the invention is concerned with water in oil emulsions which can be applied to the skin to improve its general condition, and to prevent, alleviate or cure skin disorders such as dry or chapped skin or clinical conditions such as psoriasis or ichthiosis. A soft, supple and flexible skin has a marked cosmetic appeal and is an attribute of normal functioning epidermis. The outer layer of the epidermis, that is the stratum corneum, can however become dry and flaky following exposure to adverse climatic conditions, or excessive contact with detergents or solvents which result in the loss of skin moisture, with the result that the skin loses its soft, supple and flexible characteristics.Emollients such as fats, phospholipids and sterols have in the past been used to soften dry skin, but it is apparent that these emollients are only partially effective as a remedy for this type of condition. Also, topical application to the skin of classical humectants is unlikely to alleviate this problem since they are not particularly skin substantive and are generally rinsed from the skin during washing. Water in oil emulsions have been employed in the formulation of cosmetic and pharmaceutical ointments, emollients creams, lotions and the like. However, while such emulsions can impart desirable characteristics of water repellancy to the skin and provide a means whereby fats, oils and waxes can be absorbed onto human skin, the use of such emulsions in skin treatment products has sometimes been precluded because they have been implicated in toxicity, skin irritancy or excessive greasiness in use. The problem of instability during storage can also occur, particularly with high internal phase cosmetic and pharmaceutical water in oil emulsions. It should be explained that by thigh internal phase emulsions is meant an emulsion in which the volume of the internal phase occupies at least 75 of the total volume of the emulsion. It has been proposed in EP A O 048 153 Unilever to provide a high internal phase water in oil emulsion comprising a branched chain non polar oil, a nonionic liquid emulsifier having an HLB value of from 1 to 7, a soluble salt of magnesium, and a product produced by reacting sodium magnesium fluorolithosilicate trioctahedral montmorillonite clay with a quaternary ammonium salt. It has also been proposed in US Patent No. 4 385 049 K V Pharmaceutical Co. to provide emulsions for topical application in which the internal phase is non lipoidal and comprises at least 75 of the emulsion, and the external phase is lipoidal. The lipoidal phase can comprise vegetable oils such as sunflower seed oil and an emulsifier such as polyglycerol oleate or glycerol monoisostearate having at least two hydrogen bonding sites per molecule. The technical examples illustrate the incorporation of Silicone Fluid 200 100mm2s 1 , a non volatile polydimethyl siloxane. Other prior proposals include those of Yu van ScottUSP 4 197 316 which describes products for the treatment of dry skin which including hydroxy alkanoic acids having up to 6 carbon atoms in the molecule, such acids being buffered with triethanolamine, and Unilever EP A 7785 which discloses skin treatment compositions containing 2 hydroxyoctanoic acid in which the pH is adjusted to values of up to 3.5 by addition of sodium hydroxide.Neither of these latter proposals suggests the use of an emulsion, especially a high internal phase emulsion, as a vehicle for the active ingredients indicated. It is therefore evident that there exists a need for a simple, effective treatment for skin which is dry or flaky to improve its general condition, and which can also alleviate or prevent the development of disorders which gave rise to dry or flaky skin. It has now been discovered that dry, flaky or chapped skin can be treated successfully to restore it to its normal soft, supple and flexible condition, by topical application of a shelf stable, relatively non greasy high internal phase water in oil emulsion that in the oily phase comprises an oil whose fatty acid components comprise a very high level of essential fatty acid. Accordingly, the invention provides a high internal phase water in oil emulsion comprising an oily phase and an aqueous phase, in which the oily phase comprises a from 1 to 3 by weight of a vegetable oil whose fatty acid components comprise at least 55 by weight of essential fatty acid b from 5 to 25 by weight of a silicone oil ingredient comprising a dispersion in a volatile silicone of a polymer of dimethyl polysiloxane with polyoxyethylene and or polyoxypropylene side chains having a molecular weight of from 10,000 to 50,000 and having the structure EMI4.1 where R isEMI4.2 a has a value of from 9 to 115, b has a value of from 0 to 50, x has a value of from 133 to 673, y has a value of from 25 to 0.25, and c from 0.5 to 10 by weight of a nonionic liquid emulsifier having an HLB value of from 1 to 7. The emulsion according to the invention consists of an internal phase which is aqueous and an external phase which is oily. Preferably, the emulsion is a high internal phase water in oil emulsion comprising from 75 to 98 by volume of an aqueous phase and from 2 to 25 by volume of an oily phase. The vegetable oil which forms an ingredient of the emulsion is one whose fatty acid components comprise at least 55 by weight of essential fatty acid. Preferably the fatty acid components of the oil comprise at least 60 , most preferably at least 70 by weight of essential fatty acid. Usually the major proportion of essential fatty acid component comprises linoleic acid. Examples of suitable vegetable oils for use in the emulsions according to the invention are given below, together with their respective mean essential fatty acid contents. Normally, the essential fatty acid will be present in the oil as a mono , di or triglyceride ester. Essential fatty acidVegetable seed oil thistle C. tinctorius 76 saffron thistle 70 safflower 67 thistle C. carduncalus 65 grape 60 linseed 72 poppy P. somniferum 62 sunflower 59 hemp 84 soya bean 63 It is to be understood that the above list is a selection of the preferred oils that can be employed and that the invention is not limited solely to the use of these oils. One or a mixture of two or more of such oils can be employed. The quantity of the specially selected oil or oils, the fatty acid components of which comprise a substantial proportion of essential fatty acid, will normally form from I to 3 , preferably 1 to 2 , by weight of the emulsions . If more than 3 by weight of such oils are employed, then the high internal phase emulsions can be difficult to prepare and can exhibit poor stability during storage at temperatures between 20 and 550C, which comprise the normal temperature range to which the emulsions according to the invention are likely to be exposed during storage in factory, warehouse, shop or home. If less than 1 by weight of such oils is employed, the benefits attributable to the presence of a substantial proportion of essential fatty acid in such oils is unlikely to provide a noticeable skin benefit when the emulsion is applied topically to the skin. The silicone oil ingredient which forms an ingredient of the emulsion comprises a 10 dispersion of a polymer of dimethyl polysiloxane with polyoxyethylene and or polyoxypropylene side chains having the structure EMI6.1 where R isEMI6.2 a has a value of from 9 to 115, b has a value of from 0 to 50, x has a value of from 133 to 673, y has a value of from 25 to 0.25. Preferably, the dimethyl polysiloxane polymer is one in which a has a value of from 10 to 114 b has a value of from 0 to 49 x has a value of from 388 to 402 y has a value of from 15 to 0.75 the group R having a molecular weight of from 1000 to 5000. A particularly preferred dimethyl polysiloxane polymer is one in which a has the value 14 b has the value 13 x has the value 249 y has the value 1.25 The dimethyl polysiloxane polymer is usually provided as a dispersion in a volatile siloxane. The silicone oil ingredient accordingly can comprise from 1 to 20 by volume of the polymer and from 80 to 99 by volume of the volatile siloxane. Ideally, the silicone oil ingredient consists of a 10 dispersion of the polymer in the volatile siloxane. Examples of the volatile siloxanes include volatile polydimethyl cyclosiloxane, such as one having a viscosity of less than 5mm2sec 1, for example DOW CORNING 344 Fluid, and volatile hexamethyldisiloxane having a viscosity of not more than 0,65mm2sec 1, for example DOW CORNING 200Fluid 0.65mm2s 1 . A particularly preferred silicone oil ingredient is cyclomethicone and dimethicone copolyol, such as DOWCORNING Q2 3225C Formulation Aid. DOW CORNING is a trade mark . The emulsion can also, optionally, comprise a non volatile silicone oil such as polydimethylsiloxane 21 copolymer having a viscosity in excess of 5mm2s1, such as that having a viscosity of from 100 to 350mm2s , for example, DOW CORNING 200 Fluid 100mmês 1 or higher . The emulsion according to the invention will normally comprise from 5 to 25 , preferably from 8 to 20 and ideally from 10 to 18 by weight of the silicone oil ingredient. The emulsifier which also forms an ingredient of the emulsion according to the invention will normally be a nonionic liquid emulsifier having an HLB value of from 1 to 7. Preferably the emulsifier will have an HLB value of from 2 to 6. Examples of suitable emulsifiers are HLB ValueARLACEL 987 sorbitan isostearate by Atlas 4.3HOSTAPHAT KO 300N moni , di , and tri phosphoric esters of oleic acid by Hoechst 2.3IMWITOR 780K glycerol monoisostearate by Witco 3.7BRIJ 92 polyoxyethylene 2 oleyl ether by Atlas 4.9Triglycerol monooleate by PVO International 4.0ARLACEL 80 sorbitan monooleate by Atlas 4.3ARLACEL 83 sorbitan sesquioleate by Atlas 3.7ARLACEL 85 sorbitan trioleate by Atlas 1.8Decaglycerol tetraoleate by PVO International 6.0Decaglycerol octaoleate by PVO International 4.0AMEROX or SIMULSOL 2 polyethoxylated 2 oleyl alcohol by Produits Chimiques de la Montagne Noire 6.7HOECHST 2721 polyglycerol sequioleate 4.0 The quantity of emulsifier in the emulsion is from 0.5 to 10 , preferably 1 to 5 by weight of the emulsion. If the emulsion contains less than 0.5 of emulsifier, it is unlikely that the emulsion, if obtained, will remain stable on storage, whereas if the emulsion contains more than 10 of emulsifier, it is no longer possible to obtain a high internal phase emulsion, and also, the stability of the emulsion is unlikely to be further improved. The emulsion also comprises water. The quantity of water in the emulsion is from 0.1 to 97.9 , preferably 1 to 97, most preferably 60 to 95 by weight of the emulsion. If the emulsion contains more than 97.9 of water, the stability of the emulsion on storage is likely to be poor and syneresis can occur. The emulsion according to the invention can also optionally comprise other ingredients which are generally cosmetically acceptable and which do not detract from the stability and efficacy of the emulsion. Such ingredients include emollients, solvents, humectants, thickeners, moisturisers, antioxidants, surfactants, anti inflammatory agents, healing agents, preservatives, buffering agents, antiseptics, antibacterial compounds, antibiotics, germicides, keratolytic agents, abradants, perfumes or skin colouring as use in face make up preparations. When the emulsion according to the invention is likely to be exposed to the air such that any volatile ingredients, such as silicones that may be present, are likely to be lost by evaporation, it is advantageous to include in the formulation of the emulsion finely divided silica, such as AEROSIL 812, in order to reduce such evaporative losses. The above examples of other ingredients is not intended to be exhaustive and many others can be employed. Further exatples are given in McCutcheons Functional Materials1 1976 Annual published by M C Publishing Co.,New Jersey. Generally, the amount of each of the above other ingredients which optionally can be employed will be that recommended by the suppliers or manufacturers or that which is conventionally employed in the art, and which will not detrimentally affect the nature and function of the emulsion. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a water in oil high internal phase emulsion suitable for topical application to the skin, which process comprises the steps of i forming an aqueous phase comprising water and water soluble ingredients ii forming an oily phase comprising the silicone oil ingredient, the emulsifier and other oil soluble ingredients except perfume iii adding the aqueous phase gradually to the oily phase at 300 to 50 C, preferably at about 400C, with vigorous stirring to form an emulsion iv and finally adding perfume together with other volatile ingredients other than the silicone oil ingredient. The emulsion according to the invention will normally take the form of, an opaque cream, white in colour unless deliberately coloured by means of added colouring matter, which can be applied topically with the finger or with a suitable applicator to the affected area of skin. Repeated application, say twice daily, to dry, flaky or chapped skin will usually be sufficient to eliminate or at least reduce the severity of the condition. The emulsion will normally be packaged in a suitable container such as a compressible tube or lidded jar or pot.
