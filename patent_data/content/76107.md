# Scanning electron beam exposure system.

## Abstract
A scanning electron beam exposure system comprises a main chamber 1 , and an automatic loading and exchanging system including a sub chamber 8 , vacuum pumps 12, 13 and valves 10, 11, 14, 15 and 16 . The projection of an electron beam onto a workpiece within the main chamber 1 is carried out in parallel with the loading and exchanging operation but the exposure is inhibited whilst an electrical or mechanical noise generated by at least one of the valves exists.
