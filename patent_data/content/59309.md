# A memory system with flexible replacement units.

## Abstract
A read only memory system with replaceable units is provided in which the replacement units have a variable capacity and may have subsequently be removed from the system once and the original unit restored. The read only memory system comprises a fixed main read only memory 12 having a plurality of addressable units 14 of uniform capacity in combination with a substitute memory means 22 having greater capacity than the addressable units. Control means are provided comprising means 18, 24 for selectively disabling units of a fixed memory, means 18, 20 for selectively enabling a portion of the substitute memory and substituting the enabled portion for a disabled fixed memory unit, and means for selectively varying the capacity of the substituted enabled unit which comprises means 13 for addressing a desired sequence of said addressable units in the fixed main memory and for simultaneously addressing control means. The capacity of the substituted enabled portion may be varied by additional apparatus 29 in said control means which can activate the addressing means to apply one or more subsequent adresses to only the substitute memory after an initial substitution. Thus, the substituted portion may be expanded while the disabled fixed memory unit is no longer even being addressed.
