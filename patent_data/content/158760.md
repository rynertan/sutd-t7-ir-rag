# Filterpresstype electrolytic cell block for water electrolysis.

## Abstract
The filterpresstype electrolytic cells of the present in vention differentiate themselves from that presently available in the art by a modular structure and thus in that they are more simple and easy to be assembled. The mechanical elements 4 5 6 constituting the elec trolytic cells CE are mechanically identical to constituting the condenser chambers C which are intended for conden sating the steam present in the oxygen and the hydrogen there produced by electrolysis. The cooling, e.g. by air, of both the electrolytic cells CE and the condenser cells C is realised by using suitable pas sageways 5 provided within the electrodes elements 4 folded in U form said electrodes elements 4 ensuring a separating function and providing the cooling function in the condenser cells. The channels for the distribution of the electrolyte and for the withdrawal of the produced gases are formed by the compression to which are submitted cylindrical rings 6 1C, 6 2C showing slits, provided in the structure of suitable spac ing frames 6 1, 6 2 which allow the building up of the cells.

## Description
MODULAR STRUCTURE FOR Fl LTERPRESSTYPE ELECTROLYTIC CELLSINTENDED FOR PRODUCING EITHER HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN SEPARATELY OR IN A MIXTURE.The present invention refers to filterpresstype electrolytic cells intended for producing either hydrogen and oxygen separately or both gases mixed together according to precise stoichiometric proportions and incorporating means for cooling said cells and for condensating the steam present in the produced gases.More particularly it is an object of the present invention to provide a modular structure for said filterpresstype electrolytic cells.A further object of the present invention is a compact mobile plant of reduced power for providing limited quantities of said gases to be employed e.g. in oxy hydrogen welding, in oxygen cutting, for producing therapeutic oxygen, for producing hydrogen and any way every time it is necessary to provide, for direct utilisation, either oxygen and hydrogen or their mixture in stoichiometric proportions.It is known that the electrolytic cells for H20 electrolyte sis are of two basic types a cells having monopolar electrodes which may be further distinguished in bell cells, diaphragm cells and bell diaphragm ce I Is b cells having bipolar electrodes which may be further di stingu ished in tnnk cetls and filterpresstype ceilsX It is also known that the cells having bipolar electrodes show, against the cells having monopolar electrodes, the folldwing advantages 1 for the same production capability and energy consum pt ion, they need less floor space 2 they allow an higher current density which make them hi ghly qualified for the production of deuterium 3 they may work under a pressure higher than the atmosphe ric avoiding consequently any auxiliary pump 4 they avoid the parallel connection which is on the con trary required by the cells having monopolar electrodes. It is hence the main object of the present invention to pro vide filterpresstype electrolytic cells which make it pos sible to achieve a larger production of oxygen and hydro gen while requesting the same energy consumption and the same manufacturing expenses as the cells presently produced and proposed on the market A further object of the present invention is to provide a modular structure for said fiiterpresstype electrolytic cells in order to reduce the manufacturig expenses of said tilterpresstype electrolytic cells, while simplifying the withdrawal of the gases produced by the electrbiysis. In order to achieve the hereabove objects, the filterpress type cells according to the present invention solve the following problems 1 the same modular mechanical elements are used for assem bling both the electrolytic cells self and the condenser chambers intended for condensating the steam present in the produced gases 2 the cooling by air of said cells is ensured by passageways realised in the electrodes themselves 3 the cooling by air of the condenser is ensured by using the same passageways in the electrodes as already mentioned in preceding point 2, which electrodes in this case ensure the function of separating elements between the successive condensation chambers 4 special spacers of an extremely low price are placed between the electrodes to allow the constructiqn of the half cel Is, of the condensation chambers, of the channels for distributing the electrolyte and of the channels for collecting the gases produced by the electrolysis 5 the body constituting the condenser is assembled and connected to one and of the body constituting the electrolytic cells in such a way as to form a unique body 6 the same cells are used for producing either oxygen and hydrogen separately or their mixture according to stoichiometric proportions.By way of non exhaustive example, some of the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings whereby fig. 1 shows a group of electrolytic cells having an asbe stos diaphragm and intended for producing oxygen and hydrogen separately fig. 2 shows a group of electrolytic cells intended for producing said gases mixed together according to stoichiometric proportions fig. 3 shows a group of condenser cells forming a condenser fig. 4 shows an example whereby the electrolytic cells and the condenser cells are assembled together in serial relationship fig.5 shows two embodiments of spacing frames used in assem bling the half cells fig.6 shows the fonctionning of the two frames of fig. 5, and, fig.7 is an overall sight of a single body plant comprising both the electrolytic cells and the condenser cells As shown in Fig. t, the basic electrolytic cell for producing oxygen and hydrogen separately comprises the following modular elements disposed according to the following assembling sequence a a first aluminium end plate 1 which cooperates with a second identical aluminium plate at the other end for compressing and firmly maitaining the plurality of cells in between tie rods, not shown, are provided to exerce said compression b a plastic frame 2 having four input output pipes made inMOPLEN R or any other suitable plastic material c a plastic plate 3 having tighting functions, bored likewise the aluminium end plates 1 and made e.g. in MOPLENt d an electrode 4 represented by a metal plate fold in U form and intended to be connected either to the positive or to the negative output of a DC power supply e a spacer 5 to be inserted inside the electrode 4 fold inU form the frame of said spacer 5 is so shaped as to form a plurality of openings which constitute the passageways for the cooling fluid e.g. air f a first spacing frame 6 1 to form the input output channels of the first half cell g an asbestos diaphragm 7 providing for the separation of the hydrogen from the oxygen h a second spacing frame 6 2, substantially symmetric of the first spacing frame 6 l, to form the second half cell and the relative input output channels for the circulation of the electrolyte and the withdrawal of the produced gases i a second electrode i.e. a metal plate 4 fold in U form, identical to that one described in point d and then the structure reproduces itself periodically.Some peculiar details of the separating frames 6 1 and 6 2 are shown in Fig. 5.Each one of said frames is provided with four cylindrical rings 6 tea, 6 2a in form of a cylindrical collar and with two toggle loops 6 lb, 6 2b to allow the passage of tie rods not shown which are intended to exerce a press iron on a plurality of cells when said plurality of cells is mounted after each other in serial relationship so as to form a coplete plantS In each of said frames 6 l, 6 2 respectively two diagonally opposed of said cylindrical rings 6 tar 6 2a show respectively slits 6 lc, 6 2c whose function is to provide a top and a bottom input output channel respectively.The channel located at the to serves to the transport of one of the gases produced by the electrolysis while the channel located at the bottom serves to introduce the electrolyte in the half cell. Each of the four cylindrical rings 6 la, 6 2a of each frame is further provided with bushes 6 ld, 6 2d acting as washers in order to provide a better tighting of the four input output channels build up by the slits in each of said four cylindrical rings of each frame when pressed against the corresponding cylindrical rings of the next following frame.The slits 6 lc in the cylindrical rings 6 la of the frame 6 1 are provided on the same side of said frame where also the bushes 6 ld are while in the cylindrical rings 6 2a of the frame 6 2 the slits 6 2c are provided on the opposite side to that where the bushes 6 2d are pojecting therefrom. The reason for this pecul iar form is to be found in that frame 6 1 is resting against the surface of the adjacent electrode 4 with that surface where the bushes 6 led are projecting therefrom while the frame 6 2 is resting on the surface of the next adjacent electrode 4 with its surface opposite to that where the bushes 6 2d are projecting therefrom.Hence the presence of the asbestos diaphragm 7 would provide an occlusion of the input output channels provide by slits 6 1c, 6 2c if the frames would have had to rest against the surface of said asbestos diaphragm 7 on the same side where said slits 6 1c, 6 2c are provided.The input output channels build up by slits 6 inc, 6 9c al low the distribution and the circulation of the electrolyte inside the electrolytic cells and provide the ways for withdrawing the oxygen and the hydrogen produced alterna tively, i,e. in one half cell the electrolyte is introdu cedthrough the channel located at the left hand corner while in the next following half cell this happen through the channel located at the right hand corner, both said channels being located at the bottom of said frames and of the compound structure when assembled, fig.7 , Similarly in one haff cell oxygen is withdrawn while in the next following half cell hydrogen is withdrawn through the respective input output channels, both these later channel being on the top of said frames and of the compound structu re when assembled, fig,7 . A group of condenser cells shown in fig.3 is buid up by an assembly of cells mechanically identical to the here above described cells for electrolysis purposes. These condenser cells differentiate themselves from the cel ls for effective electrolysis purposes only in that the re spectiveelectrodes 4 are not connected to whatever polarity of whatever DC power supply.Said electrodes 4 have, in the condenser cells, a mechanical function of hydraulic separating, tighting element and simultaneously the function of cooling surface5, but no electrical functionMoreover the asbestos diaphragm 7may be and is normally omitted it has to be maintained where the two gases are intended to be produced separatelyHence the basic element for condenser cells comprises an electrode 4 iso. a first metal sheet 4 fold in U form with the spacing frame 5 inside which allows the cooling air to circulate inside said tighting and cooling means 4, a first plastic frame 6 1 to build up the first conden sing half cell, a second metal sheet fold in U form, like en electrode 4, with its spacing frame 5 inside, or, in an alternative embodiment, a simple metal sheet 4a as shown in fig. 2 , a second plastic frame 6 2 to build up the second conden singhalf cell which is followed by a third metal sheet fold in U form 4 and so on.The condenser body is terminated with a tighting plastic end plate 3,a frame 2 with Four output pipes made e.g, in ENo and an aluminium end plate 1 to allow the compression of the whole by means of tie rods not shown In the condenser chambers the gases to be condensed tra vei through a zig zag diagonal path in order to increase the time said gases will remain in contact with the cooled natal surfaces of metal sheets 4 The gas to be condensed enters one of the input output channels and, after the steam has been condensed, travels to the diagonally opposite channel from which it is with drawn to be introduced in a device for recuperating the condensed steamThe production of oxygen and hydrogen mixed in stoichiometric proportions takes place in electrolytic cells as shown in Fig.2, Said cells differentiate themselves from that wherein oxygen and hydrogen are produced separately only in that the asbestos diaphragm 7 is omitted and in that, if the cooling is per se sufficient, a simple metal sheet 4a may be used as electrode 4 instead of the normal electrode represented by a metal sheet fold in U form and having inside the spacer 5 constituting passageways for the cooling fluid.The hydrogen and oxygen so produced in each half cell may be indifferently withdrawn either through the channel on the lefthand side or through the channel located on the right hand side Figw 4 shows an example of assembly whereby the group of electrolytic evils and the group of condenser cells are mounted after each other in serial relationship.The group of condenser cells C shows the aluminium compression plate 1 the plastic frame 2 with its four output pipesj the plastic tighting plate 3 made eXgX in MOPLEN the first separating element represented by the electrode 4 fold in U form and having inside the spacer 5 which provides the passageways for the cooling fluid the plastic frame 6 1 to provide the input output channels for the gases submitted to condensation the second separating and cooling element ire the metal sheet 4 fold in U form with its spacer 5 inside said second separating and cooling element 4 completes the first condenser half cell.Then the structure repeates itself periodically until a suitable number of condenser cells is so assembled The group of electrolytic cells CE shows the plastic tighting plate 3 which ensures the tighting be tween the block of condenser cells C and the block of electro lytic cells CE the first electrode 4, represented by a metal sheet fold in U form and connected to one of the pol.arities of the DC power supply said electrode 4 has inside the spacer 5 to build up the passageways for the cooling fluid the first plastic frame 6 1 to form the first half cell and the relative input output channels for the circulation of the electrolyte and the withdrawal of the there produced gas the asbestos diaphragm 7 having the separating function for the two gases the plastic frame 6 2 to form the second half cell and the respective channels for the electrolyte and the gases the second electrode 4 fold in U form, connected to the other polarity of the DC power supply and having its spacer 5 inside to provide the cooling function the second plastic frame 6 1 to form the third half cell and then the structure repeates itself periodically. In Fig. 7 is schematical ly shown an assembly containing a group of electrolytic cells CE and a group of condenser cells C, whereby it is to be appreciated that the condenser block C is mounted in serial relationship with the electrolytic cells block CE so as to form a single body plant of omogeneous design and showing a substantially prismatic form.The electrolyte is introduced in the channels on the bottom of one end of said single body plant. The produced gases travel toward the other end of the electrolytic cells block CE and, after having been introduced in the block of condenser cellsC, each in a different half cell, they are withdrawal through the channels on the bottom at the end of the condenser block C the steam present in the produced gases having been condensed in the meantime.The paths travel led by the hydrogen and the oxygen in each group of half cells are shown in detail in Figx 6, whereby it is to be appreciated that the hydrogen enters each cell through the channel formed on the top by the cylindrical rings shown on the right hand side in Fig. 5, while the oxygen enters each cell through the channel formed by the cylindrical rings shown on the left hand side in said Fig. 5.Similarly happens for the electrolyte which enters each cell altenatively through the channels provided on the bottom and diagonally opposed to the channels through which the gases enter each cell. While the forms of the mechanical elements constituting the modular structure, object of the present invention, herein described constitute some preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is to be understood that the invention is notI imited to these precise forms of said mechanical elements and that many changes may be made therein esg in the form and to the location of the slits 6 lc, 6 2c in the form of the plastic plates 2 and 3, and,finally in the form and structure of the spacer 5 inside the electrodes 4 provided that this later, in cooperation with the electrodes 4, allows a good ventilation for the cooling function without departing from the scope of the invention which is defined in the appended claims.
