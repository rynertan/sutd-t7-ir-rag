# Analgesic syringe.

## Abstract
This invention consists of a syringe 10 with a thin walled plastic reservoir 26 lodged under a collapsible roof 22 that is located at the distal end of the syringe barrel adjacent the needle 42 . Hermetically stored in the thin walled reservoir is a local anesthetic. Depression of the syringe plunger 18 applies pressure to the collapsible roof 22 which compresses sharp projections 28 through the walls of the plastic reservoir. The sharp projections rupture the plastic reservoir 26 and the continued depression of the plunger induces flow of the anesthetic through a filter 64 and one way valve 68 into a porous needle 42 . The porous needle projects forward of a second needle 20 . This second needle is coupled to the syringe cylinder for passage of fluids. The openings 44 along the length of the porous needle provide for flow of the local anesthetic in multiple directions which results in anesthetization of the region through which the needles are passed in search of a vein or body cavity.
