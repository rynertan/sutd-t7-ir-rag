# Aqueous compositions containing overbased materials.

## Abstract
An aqueous composition comprising A water B an overbased material dispersed with component A , said over based material being selected from the group consisting of B I a Newtonian overbased material or B II a non New tonian colloidal disperse system comprising 1 solid metal containing colloidal particles predispersed in 2 a disperse me dium of at least one inert organic liquid and 3 as an essential third component at least one member selected from the class consisting of organic compounds which are substantially sol uble in said disperse medium, the molecules of said organic compound being characterized by polar substituents and hydrophobic portions and an effective amount of at least one additional component to disperse component B with compo nent A , said additional component being selected from the group consisting of C at least one nitrogen containing, phos phorus free carboxylic solubilizer made by the reaction of C I at least one carboxylic acid acylating agent having at least one hydrocarbon based substituent of about 12 to about 500 car bon atoms with C II at least one a N hydroxyl substituted hydrocarbyl amine, b hydroxyl substituted poly hydrocar byloxy analog of said amine or c mixture of a and b , D at least one surfactant, or E mixture of C and D . The fore going aqueous compositions are optionally provided in combi nation with F a functional additive and or G a dispersion en hancer selected from the group consisting of polyhydroxy com pounds and partial ethers of polyhydroxy compounds. A meth od for cutting hard materials such as quartz, silicon and the like utilizing the foregoing compositions, as well as abrasive slurries for said cutting method and for conventional lapping applications and for metal working or polishing applications is provided.
