# Acrylic fiber having improved basic dyeability and process therefor.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an acrylic fiber having improved basic dyea bility. The fiber is made by a process wherein a copolymer of an acrylic monomer and a sulfonated vinyl monomer is dis solved in a solvent to form a spinning dope and a solution of polystyrene in the same solvent is added to the dope prior to spinning the dope to form fibers. The polystyrene will be in the form of a separate phase dispersed through the spinning dope and the fibers formed from the dope. Fibers formed from this polystyrene containing dope have improved basic dyea bility.
