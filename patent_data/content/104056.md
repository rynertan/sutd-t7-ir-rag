# PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICE

## Abstract
A container for pressurized fluids has a cylindrical side wall which is closed at one end by an internally concave bottom wall. A pressure relief device for the container comprises an externally protruding cup shaped impression in the container bottom wall. The impression has a circular wall which is joined at one end to the container bottom wall and which is closed at the opposite end by a first base portion. A tab is located in the base portion. The tab is partially circumscribed by a line of reduced material thick ness along which the base portion separates in response to over pressurization of the container contents, thus freeing the tab for outward deflection to provide an outlet through which the contents may escape. A separate cup shaped insert has a circular wall forcibly received within the circular wall of the cup shaped impression. The insert is dimen sioned to radially stress the base portion of the cup shaped impression in tension.
