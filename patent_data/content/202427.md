## Description
The present invention relates to a method of correcting image input signals, and more particularly, it relates to a method employed in the field of process printing or the like, which is required to read the original in high fidelity and a method of correcting input signals. In a conventional image input device e.g. US A 4 287 536 for reading the original through a photosensor such as a photo diode array formed by a plurality of photo electric conversion elements and CCD charge coupled device , picture signals read by the photosensor are subjected to so called shading correction to be supplied to an image processing device, so that the original is read in high fidelity. The shading correction is so performed as to prevent influences such as dispersion of difference in sensitivity between the respective elements specific to the photosensor, variation of dark currents and irregular illumination originating in an optical or illumination unit. Data required for such shading correction are stored in memory as reference data for correction in advance to reading of the original so that the shading correction is performed by adjusting the gain of the picture signals to be read on the basis of the said reference data for correction. The aforementioned reference data for correction have generally been fetched in the memory through use of the photosensor for reading the original with a white reference panel located on its focal position thereby to perform main scanning for one scanning line. In such a method, however, foreign matters such as black spots and dust sticking on the main scanning lines of the white reference panel may be so clearly resolved that false information is fetched as the reference data for correction. Further, when the surface of the reference panel is slightly irregular, the direction of reflection or transmission of light may be changed to some extent depending on the position of scanning to change the amount of incident light, and hence, also in this case, false information is fetched as the reference data for correction. The shading correction cannot be precisely performed with such false reference data, whereby the original cannot be read in high fidelity. The present invention is directed to a method of correcting input signals of the said image input device. The method of correcting input signals of an image input device according to the present invention, is set out in the claim to which reference is now directed. Accordingly, the principal object of the present invention is to provide a method of correcting input signals in an image input device. According to the present invention, the reference data for correction are obtained by performing main scanning of the reference plane which is even in density at least once in a defocusing manner. Therefore, even if foreign matters stick on the reference plane or the surface of the reference plane is slightly irregular, substantially no influence is exerted on the reference data for correction, which are fetched in high accuracy to correct the picture signals from the original, thereby to facilitate the operation for reading the original in high fidelity. These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In order to facilitate easy understanding of the present invention, detailed description is now made on shading correction. As well known in the art, the photoelectric conversion characteristics of respective elements of a photosensor such as a photo diode array or CCD are in the following relation It is well known that dispersion of the conversion efficiency S Assuming that V Further, assuming that V The amount of X where K The value K The shading correction is performed by calculating the above expression 5 . In other words, the expression 5 is operated through the reference signals V Fig. 4 illustrates output voltage characteristics after shading correction, in which a characteristic curve C shows the output voltage characteristics obtained by shading correction of a picture signal corresponding to the characteristic curve A in Fig. 3 on the white level reference plane and a characteristic curve D shows the output voltage characteristics obtained by shading correction of a picture signal corresponding to the characteristic curve B in Fig. 3 on the reference plane in a dark state. Both of the characteristic curves C and D are representative of output characteristics of constant voltage. In order to perform shading correction in high definition, it is necessary to accurately fetch reference data for correction corresponhding to V According to the present invention, therefore, the reference data are fetched by performing main scanning in defocusing state, so as to correctly fetch the same even if foreign matters stick on the reference plane or the surface of the reference plane is slightly irregular. Thus, the wite level reference plane is scanned in constant width in the so called out of focus state, whereby data at the center of scanning as well as those around the same are simultaneously fetched to obtain levelled data. Therefore, even if foreign matters stick on the scanning lines of the white level reference plane, data in white regions around the said foreign matters are simultaneously fetched with those of the foreign matters to be levelled therewith, and hence influences by the foreign matters are reduced to obtain reference data in high definition. In the case where the reference plane is slightly irregular such that respective points on the reference plane are somewhat different in the direction of reflection or transmission of light from each other, further, a levelled amount of incident light can be obtained by performing main scanning in a defocusing state, thereby to reduce influences by irregularity of the reference plane and obtain white reference data in high accuracy. Fig. 1 is a diagram showing a method of defocusing an image input device for fetching reference data. As shown in Fig. 1, the image input device comprises an objective lens system 3, a photosensor 4 located on one focus thereof and a white reference panel 5 located on the other focus so that the image on the white reference panel 5 is reflected by mirrors 6 and converged through the objective lens system 3 to be formed on the photosensor 4. In this case, main scanning is performed in a perpendicular manner with respect to Fig. 1. In the device as shown in Fig. 1, a member 7 for changing the optical path length is formed by a glass plate etc. to be inserted in the optical path defined through the white reference panel 5, the mirrors 6 and the objective lens system 3, so as to locate the white reference panel 5 in a non focal position as the result. In practice, the optical path length changing member 7 may be inserted, e.g., in front or back of the objective lens system 3 or the interior thereof, since the objective lens syste, 3 is generally formed by combined lenses. Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram showing an example of the image input device. The image input device 2 is adapted to perform shading correction of picture signals read by the photosensor 4, thereby to supply the same to an image processing device 8, as hereinafter described. Although the circuit of this embodiment is so structured as to fetch reference data by performing main scanning by N times N integer not less than one , the number of main scanning times is not particularly restricted. In more detail, the output terminal of the photosensor 4 is connected to one input terminal of an adder 10 and the input terminal of an N multiplier 11 through an A D converter 9. The output terminal of the adder 10 is connected to the input terminals of a white reference data memory 13 and a black reference data memory 14 through a switching circuit 12. The respective input terminals of the white and black reference data memories 13 and 14 are so connected as to receive grounded signals through another switching circuit 15. The said switching circuits 12 and 15 are adapted to selectively electrify either the white reference data memory 13 or the black reference data memory 14 in response to a memory input control signal The output terminal of the white reference data memory 13 is connected to the plus input terminal of subtracter 16, as well as to the other input terminal of the adder 10 through a switching circuit 17. On the other hand, the output terminal of the black reference data memory 14 is connected to the minus input terminals of the subtracters 16 and 18. Either the switching circuit 17 or 19 is selectively electrified in response to an adder input control signal The output terminal of the N multiplier 11 is connected to the plus input terminal of the subtracter 18. The subtracter 16 is adapted to operate difference between the white and black reference data received from the white and black reference data memories 13 and 14, to supply the same to one input terminal of a divider 20. The subtracter 18 is adapted to operate difference between the image data received from the N multiplier 11 and the black refernce data received from the black reference data memory 14, to supply the same to the other input terminal of the divider 20. The divider 20 divides the data received from the subtracter 18 by those received from the subtracter 16 to perform shading correction, thereby to output corrected picture signals to the image processing device 8. In order to fetch the reference data, main scanning of the reference plane is performed N times with the position of scanning relatively changed in the feed direction, and position of main scanning may be shifted in the feed direction by the following methods in practice In a first method as shown in Fig. 6, the mirrors 6 are moved along the feed direction, i.e., transversely in Fig. 6. In a second method as shown in Fig. 7, the mirrors 6 are fixed and the reference panel 5 is moved along the feed direction, i.e., transversely in Fig. 7. It is to be noted that main scanning of the reference plane may be performed N times with the position of scanning relatively changed along the main scanning direction or along both of the main scanning and feed directions. The image input device according to the present invention is further provided with a switching mechanism for selectively switching the object of image formation of the lens system 3 to either the reference plane or the original. Description is now made on the aforementioned image input device according to the present invention. The white and black reference data memories 13 and 14 are cleared in advance to fetch of the reference data. In procedure, a low signal is supplied as the memory input control signal After the white and black reference data memories 13 and 14 are cleared, setup operation is performed in order to store data in the white and black reference data memories 13 and 14 by supplying a high signal as the memory input control signal Then white reference data for shading correction are fetched in the white reference data memory 13. In procedure, a high signal is supplied as the adder input control signal Then an illumination unit assembled in the image input device 2 illuminates the white reference panel 5, thereby to select the same as the object of image formation of the lens system 3. Further, the white reference panel 5 is located in a non focal position by the method as hereinabove described with reference to Fig. 1 or 5. In this state, the white reference panel 5 is subjected to main scanning for one scanning line by the photosensor 4. In response to the main scanning operation, the A D converter 9 converts analog pictrue signals sequentially outputted from the respective elements of the photosensor 4 into digital picture signals, which are supplied to one input terminal of the adder 10. Every time the said one terminal of the adder 10 receives the said digital picture signal, data stored in the corresponding storage region is read from the white reference data memory 13 in synchronization with the main scanning operation to be supplied to the other input terminal of the adder 10, which in turn adds up the both data thereby to updatingly store the data thus obtained in the original storage region of the white reference data memory 13. Upon completion of the data fetch operation by the first main scanning operation by the photosensor 4, the main scanning position is shifted in the feed direction by method as hereinabove described with reference to Fig. 6 or 7. Also in this case, the adder 10 adds up image data obtained by the main scanning operation and the corresponding image data stored in the white reference data memory 13 in synchronization with the main scanning operation by the photosensor 4, thereby to updatingly store the data thus obtained in the original storage region of the white reference data memory 13. In the case where the main scanning operation is further pereformed three or more times, the main scanning position is further relatively changed in the feed direction in a similar manner to the above to perform respective main scanning operation such that image data obtained per main scanning operation is added up with corresponding image data stored in the white reference memory 13, to be updatingly stored in the same. Thus, the white reference data for correction are fetched in the white reference data memory 13 by main scanning operation by the prescribed number of times i.e., N times . After the white refernce data are completely fetched, black reference data are fetched in the black reference data memory 14. In procedure, a low signal is supplied as the adder input control signal Then the reference plane of white reference panel 5 is changed to that of the black level. In this state, the first main scanning operation is perfomed on the black level reference plane through the photosensor 4, thereby to convert analog picture signals sequentially outputted from the respective elements of the photosensor 4 into digital signals by the A D convertor 9, to supply the same to one input terminal of the adder 10. Every time the said one input terminal of the adder 10 receives the digital picture signal, the data stored in the corresponding region is read from the black reference data memory 14 in synchronization with the main scanning operetion by the photosensor 4 to be supplied to the other input terminal of the adder 10, which in turn adds up the both data to updatingly store the data thus obtained in the original storage region of the black reference data memory 14, in a similar manner to the operation for fetching the white reference data. Such main scanning operation is performed N times in the same scanning position so as to add up the image data and the corresponding image data stored in the black reference data memory 14 every time the image data is obtained by the respective main scanning operation, thereby to updatingly store the data thus obtained in the original storage region of the black refernce data memory 14 for shading correction. Although the black reference data are fetched after the white reference data, the fetch operation is not restricted to the said order, but may be performed in a reverse manner. The original is read subsequent to the aforementioned reference data fetch operation. In procedure, the object of image formation of the lens system 3 is switched from the white reference panel 5 to the original through the swictching mechanism assembled in the image input device 2. Then the original is brought into the focus to be scanned through the photosensor 4 by a well known method. When the first scanning operation for one scanning line is performed by the photosensor 4, the A D converter 9 converts analog picture signals seqentially outputted from the respective elements into digital picture signals to supply the same to the N multiplier 11, which in turn multiplies the same by N and outputs the results to the plus input terminal of the subtracter 18. Every time an N multiplied image data The divider 20 divides the difference data The N multiplier 11 may be omitted by multiplying the white reference data received in the subtracters 16 and 18 by 1 N. Further, instead of employing the black level reference plane, the illumination unit may be turned off. In this case, correction may be performed in the same manner whether the signals employed are obtained through use of the black reference plane or by turning off the illumination unit. According to the present invention as hereinabove described, main scanning of the white level reference plane is performed in a defocusing manner by the photosensor 4 to fetch the white reference data. Therefore, even if foreign matters such as black spots and dust stick on the main scanning lines of the white reference plane, not only the data on the foreign matters but data on white regions around the same are simultaneously fetched to obtain levelled data, whereby influences by the foreign matters are reduced to obtain white reference data in high definition. Further, even if the surface of reference plane is slightly irregular such that respective points thereof are different in the direction of reflection or transmittance of light, a levelled amount of incident light can be obtained by performing main scanning in defocusing manner, whereby the influence by the irregular reference plane is reduced to obtain the white reference data in high accuracy. Thus obtaind are highly accurate reference data, and in consequence, the original can be read in high fidelity by correcting the picture signals on a the same by the accurate reference data. Further, as hereinabove described with reference to the embodiment, the main scanning operetion of reference plane is performed a plurality of times while relatively changing the scanning position in the feed or main scanning direction or in both directions in order to fetch the reference data, to further reduce influences by false data fetched in the reference data by foreign matters sticking on the reference plane and electric disturbance, thereby to obtain further accurate reference data and facilitate reading of the original in high fidelity.
