# INDOLES, PROCESS FOR PREPARING THEM AND DUPLICATING OR MARKING SYSTEMS CONTAINING THEM

## Abstract
3 Alkoxy aryl or heteroaryl methyl 1H indoles which are useful as color formers in pressure sensitive carbonless duplicating systems and thermal marking systems are pre pared by reacting 3 arylsulfonyl aryl or heteroaryl methyl 1H indoles with alcohols in the presence of a base.
