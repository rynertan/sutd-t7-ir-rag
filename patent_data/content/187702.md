## Description
N w, o1 DIALKOXY AND N t ,, DIALKENOXY ALK 1 YL N,N,N T RISUBSTITUIED AMMONIUM SURFACTANTS, THEIR PREPARATION AND PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS CONTAI N I NG THEM This invention relates to glycerol based cationic compounds. The compounds of this invention are illustrated by formula IEMI1.1 or an optical isomer thereof wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and are alkyl or alkenyl of 6 to 22 5 carbons R5, R4 and R may be the same or different and are hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 8 carbons, aryl, aralkyl of 7 to 11 carbons, or when two or three of R 3, R41 and R5 are taken together form quinuclidino, piperidino, pyrrolidino, or morpholino n is 1 to 8 andX is a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. These compounds may be used in any of the many uses for which cationic surfactants find application. For example, they may be used in industrial application, in food or feeds, in pharmaceutical formulation, cosmetological compositions, or other areas where surfactants may be employed. As these compounds are pharmaceutically non t6xid compounds, they may also be used in cosmetology, for example, in makeups, lipstick, eyeshadow material, they may also be used in fingernail polishes, in body lotions, moisturizing creams, anctthe like. These compounds may also be used for application to the hair, either alone or in combination with other materials, such as in shampoos, hair conditioners, permanent wave formulations or hair straighteners, or as components in hair creams, gels, and the like. Of particular interest is the use of these compounds in pharmaceutical formulations, particularly topical formulations such as ointments, gels, pastes, creams, and the like and more particularly for the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations containing liposomes. The consistency of the formulation depends on the amount of aqueous solution used to make the formulation. In such formulations containing compounds of this invention, drugs which are insoluble or only sparingly soluble themselves in aqueous solutions can be solubilized so that a greater concentration of drug can be presented to the body. In pharmaceutical formulations, these compounds may be used in those contexts where cationic surfactants are acceptable for the formulation of creams, pastes, gels, colloidal dispersions, and the like. For additional information, reference is made to Remington sPharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition, Mack PublishingCompany, Easton, Pennsylvania 1980 , editor Arthur Osol, or any other standard treatise on pharmaceutical formulations. The compounds of this invention are particularly useful in the preparation of liposomes. Liposomes are microscopic vesicles or blisters consisting of concentric lipid bilayers, generally spherically shaped.Structurally, liposomes range in size and shapes from long tubes to spheres, with dimensions of a few hundred Angströms to fractions of a millimeter. Regardless of the overall shape, the bilayers are generally organized as closed concentric lamellae, with an aqueous layer separating each lamella from its neighbor. Vesicle size normally ranges between 20 30,000 nm in diameter. The liquid film between lamellae is usually 3 10 nm. In the broadest terms, liposomes are prepared from one or more surfactants. Though it has been thought that any type of surfactant could be used in liposomes, e.g.cationic, neutral or anionic surfactants, experience with positively charged liposomes has indicated several problems which have not been fully addressed to date.The tertiary amines which have to date been employed in preparing liposomes have either not been sufficiently chemically stable to allow for the storage of the vesicle itself short shelf life or the structure of the amines has been such that they can be leached out of the liposome structure. Also one of the tertiary amines, stearoylamine, has toxicity concerns which limit its use as a component of a liposome. Compounds of Formula I do not suffer from these infirmities. The ether linkage of the compounds of formula I is highly stable in liposomes. The compounds of formula I are not leached out of nor do they otherwise migrate out of the liposome matrix as do stearoyl amines and other tertiary amines.Toxicity is not a concern with the compounds of Formula I Positively charged pharmaceutical formulations, particularly liposomes, are pharmaceutically advantageous. Mammalian cells are negatively charged so the presentation of positively charged materials results in better attachment to and absorption by membranes. Typically, the liposome formulations of this invention will be comprised of 0.05 to 10 drug by weight, 1 to 20 surfactant by weight of which a compound of formula I comprises 1 to 100 of this surfactant component and an aqueous solution, that is, water which may or may not contain salts and buffers, in a quantity sufficient to make 100X bysvolume. Particularly preferred are formulations which contain 1 to 5 drug and a compound of formula I comprises 50 or more by weight of the surfactant component. Most preferred is a formulation which contains 5 drug by weight, a compound of formula I comprises the only surfactant component which component is present in an amount of 20 by weight and an amount of aqueous solution sufficient q.s. to make 100 by volume. Formulations of this invention, particularly liposomes, made with the compounds of formula I will exhibit the properties of a positively charged entity when compounds of formula I, comprising 1 or more by weight of the total weight, are used with a neutral liposome forming material. Thus, other excipients, surfactants and the like which are used for making liposomes, can be used in these formulations. One may use any combination of secondary surfactants with the compounds of formula I so long as there is 1 or more of a compound of formula I present in the formulation. Secondary surfactants which can be used are, fbr example, ternary or complex lipids, glycerides, cerides, etholides and sterides, namely one of several compounds wherein the hydrophilic group is phosphate, carboxylate, sulfate, amino, hydroxyl or choline group and the lipophilic group is alkyl or alkenyl, polyoxyalkylene or an alkyl group substituted with at least one aromatic or cycloalkyl group. Polyethyleneoxy or glycol groups may be used. Additional surfactants suitable for incorporation into these formulations can be found in the McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers andMcCutcheon s Functional Materials, Allured Pub. Co., Ridgewood, N.J., b.S.A. Preferred secondary surfactants are phospholipid related materials such as, for example, lecithin, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, lysolecithin, lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidylserine , phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, cephalin, cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid, cerebrosides, dicetyl phosphate, phosphatidylcholine and dipalmjitoylphosphatidylcholine. Additional, non phosphorus containing lipids are, for instance, cetyl palmitate, glyceryl ricinoleate, hexadecyl stearate, isopropyl myristate, amphoteric acrylic polymers, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, alkanoyl aryl sulfonates, and the like. Additional additives may be long chain alcohols and diols sterols, for example, cholesterol phosphoric esters of fatty alcohols, for example, sodium dicetyl phosphate alkylsulfates, for example, sodium cetyl sulfate certain polymers such as polypeptides and proteins. Typically, liposomes can be divided into three categories based on their overall size and the nature of the lamellar structure. The three classifications, as developed by the New York Academy Sciences Meeting on, Liposomes and Their Use in Biology and Medicine, ofDecember 1977, are multi lamellar vesicles MLV , small uni lamellar vesicles SUV and large uni lamellar vesicles LUV . SUV s range in diameter from approximately 20 50 nm and consist of a single lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous compartment. While SUV are single compartmental vesicles of fairly uniform size, MLV vary greatly in size up to 10,000 nm, or thereabouts, are multi compartmental in their structure and contain more than one bilayer.LUV liposomes are so named because of their large diameter which ranges from about 600 nm to 30,000 nm they contain more than one bilayer. Liposomes may be prepared by a number of methods not all of which produce the three different types of ltposowes. For example, ultrasonic dispersion by means of immersing a metal probe directly into a suspension of MLV s is a common way for preparing SUV s. Preparing liposomes of the MLV class usually involves dissolving the lipids in an appropriate organic solvent and then drying down the solvent under a gas or air stream. This leaves behind a thin film of dry lipid on the surface of the container. An aqueous solution is then introduced into the container with shaking in order to free lipid material from the sides of the container.This process disperses the lipid, causing it to form into lipid aggregates or liposomes. Liposomes of the LUV variety may be made by slow hydration of a thin layer of lipid with distilled water or an aqueous solution of some sort. Alternatively, liposomes may be prepared by lyophilization. This process comprises drying down lipids to a film under a stream of nitrogen. This film is then dissolved in a volatile solvent, frozen, and placed on a lyophilization apparatus to remove the solvent. To prepare a pharmaceutical formulation containing a drug, a solution of the drug is added to the lyophilized lipids, whereupon liposomes are formed. A variety of methods for preparing various liposome forms have been described in the periodical and patent literature. For specific reviews and information on liposome formulations, reference is made to reviews byPagano and Weinstein Ann. Rev. Biophysic. Bioeng., 7, 435 68 1978 and Szoka and Papahadjopoulos Ann. Rev.Biophysic. Bioeng., 9, 467 508 1980 and additionally to a number of patents for example, U.S. Patent Nos.4,229,360 4,224,179 4,127,344 4,193,893 4,217,344 4,241,046 4,078,052 and 4,235,871. The compounds of this invention may be prepared as a racemic mixture of D,L isomer or as the individual D or L isomer. Because of the availability of D or L starting materials, certain of these compounds are readily prepared as the individual isomer. However, unless the specific isomer is designated, it should be understood that this invention covers both the pure D or L isomers as well as the D,L racemate. Compounds of formula 1 have one asymmetric site, marked above as , and thus can exist as diastereomers. Individual isomers of compounds of formula 2 are named herein using the IUPAC R S convention, sometimes called the sequence rule. A description of the R S convention may be found, for example, in Introduction to Organic Chemistry by A. Streitwieser, Jr. and C. Heathcock, Macmillan Pub. Co.,New York, 1976 , pages 110 114. Where appropriate, the optical activity of a compound may be indicated by , , or , referring to the direction in which a solution of the compound rotates a plane of polarized light.

Compounds of this invention are made by two procedures which depend on the value of n. there n the compounds most analogous to glycerol, the compounds of this invention are derived from D mannitol. The two central hydroxy groups of mannitol are first protected by formation of of asketal, for example by formation of the acetonide. The four remaining hydroxy groups are then converted to ethers using the appropriate long chain fatty acid. This molecule is then chemically split into two units of aldehyde of 3 carbons each, wherein two carbons are substituted with a long chain alkyl or alkenyl group.The aldehyde functionality is then converted to a tertiary amine and then further converted to either the acid addition salt or a quaternary ammonium compound. This process is exemplified by Reaction SchemeI as follows. REACTION SCHEME IEMI10.1 In this reaction scheme R1 and R2 are as defined above and R has the same definition as R3, R4, and R5 above. It should be noted that the term acetonide and the term isopropylidine are used interchangably in the following reaction schemes and examples. The D mannitol 3,4 acetonide of formula 1 is a known compound which may be prepared according to the methods of Wiggins, L. F., J. Chem. Soc., 13 1946 or Morpain,C. Tisserand, M., 3. Chem. Soc., Perkins Transactions, 1 6 , 1379 19 9 . To form the compound of formula 1, perchloric acid is added to a mixture of D mannitol and 2,2 dimethoxypropane in acetone to form 1,2 3,4 5,6 trtisopropylidine D mannitol. This compound is then dissolved in 70X acetic acid, heated for 1 1 2 hours, and crystallized from ethyl acetate to giveD mannitol 3,4 acetonide. To effect formation of compound 2, the acetonide is dissolved in an appropriate polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, diethylformamide, or the like. To this is added a strong base, such as sodium hydride, at room temperature. This mixture is then heated, preferably between about 300 and 1000C, more preferably to about 500C, with stirring for approximately 30 to 90 minutes, preferably about 60 minutes. To this is then added an alkylating agent of the desired chain length exemplified by the toluenesulfonate ester of oleoyl alcohol or by l bromohexadecane. Following addition of the alkylating agent, the temperature is increased to between about 500 and 1500C, preferably about 900C, with additional stirring over a period of up to 2 hours, preferably about 1 hour. The base heat alkylating agent heat sequence is repeated five times.In the first addition, the base is added in an equal molar amount to the amount of acetonide being used and the alkylating agent is added in an equal molar amount. This sequence of adding a molar amount of base with heating followed by a molar amount of the alkylating ester with heating and stirring is repeated four times for a total of five times in order to effect the formation of compound 2. Compound 3, a mannitol tetraether, is made by hydrolyzing the ketal, illustrated by the acetonide. The hydrolysis is carried out as a single phase reaction using a polar, water soluble organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran. Preferably, the hydrolysis will be effected by means of a 1a solution of water in trifluoroacetic acid. The solution of the mannitol tetraether compound 3 in organic solvent and aqueous acid solution is stirred for approximately one hour at a slightly elevated temperature, approximately 5O0C, or thereabouts. The solvent is then evaporated and residual acid removed by azeotropic distillation using a solvent such as toluene. The aldehyde 4 is made by treating diol 3 with an oxidant, preferably one such as lead tetraacetate, in a solvent best illustrated by chloroform. A slight molar excess of lead tetraacetate is used to effect the reaction. The mixture is stirred at about ambient temperature for up to 4 hours, preferably about 2 hours, at which time the excess lead tetraacetate is quenched by addition of ethylene glycol followed quickly by the addition of a substantial amount of water. The resulting crude aldehyde is recovered by conventional means and may be used without further purification directly in the next step. To effect the formation of the compound of formula 5, a di substituted amine hydrochloride the substituents have the definitions for R3, R4 and R5 above is dissolved in an alcohol, preferably methanol, to which solution is added a two thirds molar amount of anhydrous sodium acetate. This mixture is stirred for about an hour at ambient temperature and the resulting sodium chloride is filtered off. The methanol solution is then added to the crude aldehyde from the preceding paragraph. A second solvent, preferably tetrahydrofuran, is th en added tod this mixture followed by molecular sieves.To this mixture is then added a reducing agent, preferably sodium cyanoborohydride, in a slight molar excess, and the mixture is stirred at a slightly elevated temperature, preferably about 40 to bdoC, for up to 3 days. This product is then converted to the hydrochloride salt by addition of an organic solvent through which HC1 gas has been bubbled. The quaternary ammonium compound is then prepared by condensing an alkyl or aralkyl chloride into a reaction vessel containing the tri substituted amine material, after which the reaction vessel is sealed and heated to about 500 to 100 C, preferably about 700C, for up to 48 hours. This procedure affords the tetra substituted ammonium chloride product of formula I wherein each R can be R3, R4 or R5 as defined above with the proviso that when any of R3, R4, or R5 is defined as aryl then that aryl group is present on the tri substituted amine . Alternatively, when compounds of Formula I, wherein n is 1 and R1 and R2 are not the same, are to be made, they can be prepared by the flowchart of ReactionScheme II which follows. REACTION SCHEME IIEMI13.1 EMI14.1 In this reacton scheme, k is benzyl. R1 and R2 are defined herein above, R1 being different from R2. The 2,5 dibenzyl D mannitol of formula 7 was prepared by the procedure of Baggett, N., Stribblehil,J. Chem. Soc. Pekin I, 1323 1977 . Concentrated sulfuric acid is added to a solution of D mannitol and benzaldehyde in dimethylformamide. After stirring for 3 days at room temperature, the solution is poured into a mixture of ice water, potassium carbonate, and petroleum ether. The 1,3 4,6 di 0 benzilidine D mannitol is then dissolved in benzyl chloride and powdered potassium hydroxide is added. The mixture is heated to 14O0C for 3 hours, then cooLed and diluted with water. Extraction with chloroform followed by washing with water gives 2,5 di 0 benzyl 1,3 4,6 di 0 benzilidine D mannitol. This compound is dissolved in ethanol and water and treated with IM HC1. After refluxing for 4 1 2 hours the reaction mixture is cooled, quenched with barium carbonate, and evaporated to dryness. The solid residue is triturated with hot ethyl acetate which is then evaporated to yield 2,5 di 0 benzyl D mannitol. The dibenzyl D mannitol is dissolved in a dry solvent, for example, acetone, to which is added a half molar amount of copper sulfate and a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid. This solution is stirred at ambient temperature for about 48 hours at which time the mixture is quenched by means of a weak base, preferably sodium carbonate, and then stirred for an additional period of time to effect the reaction. The solvent is also the source of the ketal. The position 1 and position 6 hydroxyl groups are then etherified by means of a strong base and an l haloalkyl, or l haloalkenyl moiety. The ketal is dissolved in a non polar solvent, such as xylene, toluene, or the like, to which is added a powdered base, such as powdered potassium hydroxide and the l haloalkyl or l haloalkenyl material. This mixture is heated at reflux for about 4 hours in order to effect formation of compound 8. The two tnzyl groups are then remove by catalytic hydrogenolysis in an appropriate solvent such as tetrahydrofuran methanol. A heavy metal catalyst such as 10 palladium on carbon is used. The reaction is carried out in an appropriate hydrogenolysis device, in this instance with heating to about 600 to 800C, for about 48 hours under about 60 psi of hydrogen. The diol obtained from the preceding hydrogenolysis is etherif ied in the same manner described above for preparing compound 9. Once the tetrasubstituted D mannitol 3,4 ketal is obtained, it is converted to formula I by the series of steps recited above for conversion of formula 2 to formula I. Those compounds wherein n is 2 to 8 are prepared from the corresponding triol. The schematic for this reaction sequence is set forth in Reaction Scheme III which follows. This scheme may also be used for preparing compounds where n is 1. REACTION SCHEME III EMI16.1 In this reaction scheme, R1 and R 2 are the same as defined herein above. In formula I, R is the same as R3, R4 and R5. The compounds of formula 12 are known in the literature or may be purchased from a chemical supply house or may be prepared as indicated herein. The ketal of formula 13, preferably the acetonide, is prepared by dissolving the appropriate triol in acetone with the addition of a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid. This reaction may be effected by stirring the solution for up to about 4 hours at room temperature, preferably about 2 hours. The resulting ketal is then recovered by standard separatory means. The unreacted position l hydroxyl group is then protected by forming an allyl ether, compound 14. This reaction is carried out by dissolving the alcohol in a dry dipolar aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamide.A strong base, such as sodium hydride an equal molar amount , is added to the alcohol which is stirred at ambient temperature for a set period and then warmed to between 800 and 1000C for an equal period. Allyl chloride, in about a 50 molar excess, is then added at the elevated temperature with stirring. Stirring and heating is continued for another 30 to 120 minutes, preferably about 60 minutes. The product is then extracted and further purified by chromatographic means. The ketal is then hydrolyzed to compound 15 by means of a dilute solution of a strong acid, for example, 1N HC1, the reaction being carried out in a polar solvent, such as methanol, ethanol, or the like. Some heat is added to the reaction mixture to effect the hydrolysis.Preferably, the solution is heated to about 500C for about 2 hours. The diol, compound 15, is converted to the diether, compound 16, in the same manner as described above for conversion of formula 1 to formula 2. Here again the etherification is carried out in a dry dipolar aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamide, using a strong base, such as sodium hydride, and the tosyl ester or halide of the appropriate alkyl or alkenyl alcohol. The reaction is repeated twice using a one molar equivalent of alkylating agent each time. As described previously, the reaction is effected at an elevated temperature, preferably between 500 to 15O0C, more specifically at about 9O0C. The position I allyl ether, compound 16, is then hydrolyzed by means of Wilkinson s catalyst tris triphenylphosphine , rhodium chloride in an acid medium. The solvent should be a polar solvent such as ethanol, preferably with a co so lvet such as tetrahydrofuran. The triether catalyst mixture is refluxed for several hours, preferably about 3 hours, at which time additional acid 1N HC1 is added and refluxing continued for several more hours, approximately 3 to 4 hours. These conditions effect hydrolysis of the allyl ether to compound 17. The alcohol, compound 17, is then converted to the amine by first creating an intermediate p toluenesulfonate ester, compound 18, to which is added a di substituted amine to effect formation of the amine compound, compound 19. By way of illustration, the alcohol is dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as pyridine, to which is added p toluenesulfonyl chloride.This mixture is stirred overnight at ambient temperature, then cooled in ice water and the product recovered by extraction means. The crude product is immediately dissolved in a di substituted amine, preferably dialkylamine, and placed in a sealed container at ambient temperature for about 1 day to effect formation of the tri substituted amine. The alcohol, compound 17, can also be converted to the quarternary amine wherein R3, R , and or R form a ring with the nitrogen by reacting compound of formula 17 with p toluenesulfonyl chloride to give the crude tosylate. This compound can be dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone and sodium iodide is added. The mixture is refluxed for 5 hours. The resulting iodopropane compound is dissolved in dichloromethane and the appropriate cyclic nitrogen containing compound is added. The mixture is sealed in a pressure reactor and heated to 1000C for 48 hours followed by chromatography to obtain the appropriate quarternary ammonium compound in which R3, R41 and R5 form a ring with nitrogen, for example, quinuclidine.Alternatively the alcohol, compound 17, is converted to the tosylate, compound 18, which is then reacted in a sealed pressure reactor to form the quarternary compound without going through the formation of the iodine containing compound. If two of R3, R4, and R5 form a ring with nitrogen, for example, pyrrolidine, piperidine, or morpholine, then alcohol 17 is converted to amine 19 as described above. Amine 19 is then reacted with a di substituted amine hydrochloride to form the corresponding compound of formula I following the same procedures as given above for the reaction of compound 5 to a compound of formula I. The tri substituted amine, compound 19, is most conveniently converted to an acid addition salt, preferably a hydrochloride salt, as a means of isolating the product. The quaternary ammonium product, formula I, is then prepared in the same manner as described hereinabove for the preparation of formula I.

EXAMPLE 23 The following compositions illustrate the use of the instant compounds in pharmaceutical formulations. 1 Thirty four mg of N 2,3 di 9 Z octadecenyloxy prop l yl N,N,N trimethylammonium chloride and 6.3 mg of 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine dipalmitate were dissolved in chloroform methanol 2 1 alum . Solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen and placed in vacuo overnight. The dried film was suspended in 1 ml of 30 mM phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 and sonicated to clarity. 2 A topical formulation was prepared by dissolving 0.025 mg of fluocinolone acetonide 6a, 9a difluoro 1l S, 16a, 17a, 21 tetrahydroxy pregna1,4 diene 3,20 dione 16,17 acetonide 0.25 grams of N 2,3 di 9 Z octadecenyloxy prop l yl N,N,N trimethyl ammonium chloride in 20 ml of dichloromethane. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas until a dry film was obtained. The film mixture was placed under vacuum overnight to evaporate off the dichloromethane completely. The dry film was then suspended in 25 ml of 1 sodium chloride solution. The suspension was sonicated until visually clear. 3 Fluocinonide 6a, 9a difluoro llS, 16our, 17a,21 tetrahydroxy pregna l,4 diene 3,20 dione, 16,17acetonide 21 acetate 0.025 grams and 1.0 grams of N 2,3 di 9 Z octadecenyloxy prop l yl N , N, N trimethyl ammonium chloride were dissolved in 20 ml of dichlormethane which was then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas until a dry film is obtained. This film mixtureswas placed under vacuum overnight to evaporate off residual dichloromethane. The resulting film was suspended in 25 ml of 1 sodium chloride solution and sonicated until visually clear. 4 There was dissolved 160 mg N 2,3 di 9 Z octadecenyloxy prop l yl N,N,N trimethylammonium chloride and 20 mg butoconazgle nitrate 1 4 4 chlorophenyl 2 2,6 dichlorophenylthio n butyl imidazole nitrates in 2 mls of chloroform. The chloroform wds removed under a stream of nitrogen and the residue was placed under vacuum overnight to remove residual chloroform. The resulting film was suspended in 2 mls of purified water by hand shaking and vortexing. s 5 Diarachidoylphosphatidyl choline, 60 mg, and 5.4 mg N 2,3 di 9 Z octadecenyloxy 3 prop 1 yl N,N,N trimethylammonium chloride was dissolved in 2 ml of chloroform which was removed under a stream of nitrogen and placed under vacuum overnight to remove residual solvent. The resulting film was suspended in 2 mls of purified water containing 20 million units of beta ihterferon by gentle trituration to avoid excessive foaming. 6 Thirty mg of N 2,3 di 9 Z octadecenyloxy prop l yl N,N,N trimethylammonium chloride and 3 mg of 6 0 stearoyl N acetyl muramyl L a aminobutyryl Disoglutamine were dissolved in chloroform. A nitrogen stream was used to remove the majority of the solvent, the residue being removed under vacuum. The resulting film was suspended in 1 ml of purified water and treated with ultrasound until clear. 7 Distearoylphosphatidyl choline, 2.22 mg, 1 mg N 2X3 di 9 z octadecenyloxy prop l yl NsNsN trimethyl ammonium chloride and 0.23 mg of cholesterol were dissolved in 1 ml chloroform. Solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen and the residue placed under vacuum overnight. The dried film was suspended in 6 mM phosphate buffered saline containing 8 Triton X 100 0.5 ml . To this was added 50 ijg of lectin affinity column purified bovine herpes antigen. Then 1 ml of packed BioBeads was added to remove Triton X 100 and shaken gently for 2 hours at 550C after which the BioBeads were decanted. 8 14 Micromoles of dioleoylphosphatidyl choline and 6 micromoles of N 2,3 di 9 Z octadecenyloxy prop l yl N,,N tYimethylammonium chloride were dissolved in 2 ml of chloroform and then dried down under a stream of nitrogen. The resulting dried film was placed under vacuum for 1 2 hour, after which the film was then dissolved into 1 ml of cyclohexane, transferred to a 100 ml round bottomed flask and frozen on dry ice. The flasks were then attached to a lyophilization apparatus and the cyclohexane removed. Murine gamma interferon solution 10.2 ml 500,000 units ml was suspended in a buffer containing 10 mM monopotassium phosphate, 2 mM sodium chloride and 3 mM potassium chloride adjusted to pH 8.0 with potassium hydroxide was then added to the lyophilized lipids which caused formation of liposomes. The liposomes were then diluted to a convenient concentration with more phosphate buffer as needed. In a similar manner other concentrations of drug in liposome can be prepared. By varying the amount of aqueous solution added to the film, the concentration of drug in the final liposome formulation can be varied between 0.05 and 10 by weight. EXAMPLE 24 The ability to solubilize a drug is increased by use of the compounds and liposomes of this invention. In this way a greater concentration of a normally insoluble or sparingly soluble drug can be presented to the body. For example, 1 14 4chlorophenyl 2 2,6 dichloropheny1thio n butyl imidazole nitrate without the presence of any of the compounds of this invention is insoluble in aqueous buffer phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 . A 0.3 soluble preparation of the above drug was prepare using the following method 18 mg of 1 4 4 chlorophenyl 2 2,6 dichlorophenyl thio n butyl imidazole nitrate and 482 mg of N 2,3 di 9 Z octadecenyloxy prop l yl N,N,N trimethylammonium chloride were dissolved in méthyiene dichloride. Themethylene dichloride was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and the dried film placed under vacuum overnight. The dried film was suspended in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, and sonicated to clarity.
