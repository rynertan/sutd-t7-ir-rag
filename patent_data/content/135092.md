## Description
METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF AMMONIA BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical Field The present invention relates to a novel enzymatic method for determination of ammonia. The determination of ammonia in the blood is deemed to be an important means for differentiation of hepatic coma, and is required for diagnosis and continuous observation of non vicarious hepatocirrhosis, fulminant hepatitis and hepatic encephalopathy. The determination of urea in the blood, on the other hand, is considered to be a significant index in a renal function test. One of the most reliable methods for measuring urea in the blood is to contact a sample with urease to produce ammonia and determine the quantity of the ammonia by the indophenol reaction. The determination of the concentration of creatinine in serum is also utilized in routine tests as an index of the renal excretory function. A method in which creatinine is catalysed by creatinine deiminase and the quantity of ammonia produced is measured is known as one method for enzymatic determination of creatinine in lieu of the Gaffe reaction heretofore employed. Thus, by contacting an amino or imino compound hereinafter referred to as ammonia producing substrate with an enzyme which acts on such a substrate compound to liberate ammonia hereinafter referred to as ammonia producing enzyme and determining the quantity of the ammonia thus formed, it is possible to measure the concentration of the substrate compound or the enzymatic activity of the ammonia producing enzyme. The determination of ammonia has the possibility of being applicable to a variety of clinical examinations.Prior Art Various methods for determination of ammonia have so far been proposed, among which the enzymatic method, ion exchange method and direct colorimetric method are used widely in the field of clinical examinations. The enzymatic method involves contacting ammonia with L glutamate dehydrogenase GlDH in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NADH or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPB the abbreviation NAD P H which will appear hereinafter indicating either NADH or NADPH and a ketoglutarate a KG and measuring the decrease in absorbance of NAD P E at 340 nm c.f., for example, J.Lab. Clin. Med. Vol. 66, p.526 1965 and JapanesePatent Pub. No. 21995 1982 . This method not only requires no treatment for deproteinization of a sample to be measured but also has the advantageous features of high specificity for ammonia and high sensitivity.The enzymatic method, however, has had a limit to its measurement sensitivity since it is also a spectrophotometric method and has further been accompanied by the problem of measurement errors resulting from side reactions of NAD P H. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to solve the above described problems by treating a test sample enzymatically to determine the quantity of ammonia contained therein, using as a signal a measurable value associated with hydrogen peroxide generated. More specifically, this invention provides a method for determination of ammonia which comprises A contacting a sample to be measured for ammonia content with GlDH in the presence of NAD P H and aKG to produce glutamate in a quantity corresponding to the ammonia content in the sample B catalyzing the resultant mixture by L glutamate oxidase GlXD in the presence of oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide in a quantity corresponding to the glutamate content in the resultant mixture C measuring the quantity of hydrogen peroxide produced or the production rate thereof and D calculating the ammonia content from the quantity of hydrogen peroxide produced or the production rate thereof thus measured. The enzyme reactions carried out in the method of the present invention are shown by the following formulae EMI3.1 As is set forth hereinabove, the method of the present invention is characterized in that ammonia is converted into L glutamate by GlDH, and the L glutamate thus formed is converted into hydrogen peroxide byGlXD, whereupon the quantity of ammonia is determined by measuring the quantity or production rate of the hydrogen peroxide. By using as a signal a measurable value associated with hydrogen peroxide, it has become possible to apply to the determination of ammonia detection systems ensuring accurate measurements with a simple operation such as the fluorometric method, chemiluminescent method and electrode method in addition to the conventional spectrophotometric method. Heretofore, a method for determination of ammonia by using as a signal a measurable value associated with hydrogen peroxide has not been known, as far as we are aware, and such a method has been established for the first time by the present invention. The method of this invention can be carried out by employing a continuous autoanalyzing system using a reactor comprising an immobilized enzyme. In accordance with this invention, the quantity of ammonia can be determined with high sensitivity in a short period of time owing to the continuous autoanalyzing system.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONSample to be analyzed A sample to be analyzed by the method according to the present invention is an aqueous sample containing ammonia to be measured. The 1,ammonia11 herein includes, in addition to ammonia which is present inherently in the sample, that formed by an ammoniaproducing enzyme. The method of the present invention includes not only the detection of ammonia in the sample or the measurement of the content thereof but also, when combined with enzyme reaction systems in which ammonia is formed, the detection or determination of an ammonia producing substrate or the measurement of the enzymatic activity of an ammoniaproducing enzyme. Examples of such ammonia producing substrate ammonia producing enzyme systems are urea urease, creatinine creatinine deiminase, amino acid amino acid dehydrogenase, amine amine dehydrogenase, amino acid ammonia lyase, phosphoramidate and hexose phosphoramidate hexose phosphotransferase, adens ine diphosphate ADP and carbamoyl phosphate carbamate kinase, acid amide amide hydrolase, and a base present in nucleic acid adenine, cytosine or guanine , nucleoside or nucleotide deaminase. Also included in samples to be analyzed by the method of this invention are reaction substrates or reagents employed in single or multistep reaction systems which can be combined with the enzyme reaction systems mentioned above in which ammonia is formed. Process steps in the enzyme reaction systems in which ammonia is formed and which are carried out prior to the measurement of ammonia according to the present invention can be controlled by any method or under any conditions suitable for the particular enzyme reaction system selected. In the case where an enzyme reaction system does not interfere with the reaction of GlDH in the first step in the method of this invention, the enzyme reaction can be allowed to proceed in parallel with the first step.GlDH Reaction The reaction in the first step of the method of this invention in which L glutamate corresponding to ammonia is produced via GlDH is per se a known reaction. This GlDH reaction, when applied to the present invention, does not require any special procedure or conditions except for some technical considerations for the subsequent G1XD reaction which must be taken into account. The G1DH reaction is described in known literature and publications, for example,Bergmeyer, H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis , 2nd,English Edition, Volume 4, pp.1802 1806, AcademicPress, Inc. 1974 and Japanese Patent Pub. No.21995 1982. For G1DH, enzymes of any source or origin such as L glutamate NAD oxido reductase deaminating EC 1.4.1.2 , L glutamate NAD P oxido reductase deaminating EC 1.4.1.3 , and L glutamate NADP oxido reductase deaminating EC 1.4.1.4 can be used. NADH or NADPH as a coenzyme and a KG as a reaction substrate are used in excess moles, and the optimum quantity thereof can be easily determined by experimentation depending upon the reaction conditions and the quantity of enzymes employed. The G1DH reaction is carried out ordinarily at a pHof 7 to 9.5, using as a buffer solution a phosphate,Tris or triethanolamine buffer solution. In the case where the enzyme EC 1.4.1.3 is employed, ADP may be added to activate the enzyme. G1XD Reaction The reaction in the second step of the method of this invention in which hydrogen peroxide corresponding to L glutamate is produced via G1XD is known in the art c.f. the Agricultural Chemical Society ofJapan, Proceedings of the Meeting in 1983, p.184, 2L 1 March 10, 1983 . This G1XD reaction is described in more detail in Japanese Patent Laid Open Pub. No.42896 1984 Japanese Patent Appln. No.145346 1982 , which corresponds to European Patent A Publication No. 0097949. For G1XD, enzymes having high substrate specificity for L glutamate are preferably used. Heretofore,G1XD produced from Streptomyces violascens c.f.Japanese Patent Laid Open Pub. No.43685 1982 and G1XD produced from Streptomyces sp. X 119 6 FERM P 6560, ATCC 39343 Agric. Biol. Chem., Vol. 47, No.6, 1323 1328 1983 have been known. The latter enzyme is superior in substrate specificity and stability, particularly pH stability at the optimum pH for GlDH, and is more preferably used in the present invention.Thus, the latter enzyme is designated as G1XD in the following disclosure. The process for producing this enzyme will be set forth in the Reference Example described hereinafter. The G1XD reaction is carried out ordinarily at a pH of 5 to 10 in a suitable buffer solution.Measurement of hydrogen peroxide As methods for measurement of the quantity of hydrogen peroxide produced or the production rate thereof, the chemiluminescence analysis, the electrochemical analysis, the fluorometric analysis, and the spectrophotometric analysis are known in the art c.f., for example, Journal of Synthetic Chemistry, Japan,Vol. 39, No.7, pp.659 666 1981 . While any of these analyses is applicable in the present invention, it is preferable for the purpose of the invention to employ a system capable of detecting hydrogen peroxide quickly and with high sensitivity. Some typical methods for measurement of hydrogen peroxide will now be described below. In a method in the chemiluminescence analysis, luminol is caused to react with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of potassium ferricyanide, and the quantity of luminescence generated by oxidation is measured. Also known is a method of this type in which luminol is replaced by isoluminol, pyrogallol or bis 2,4,6trichlorophenyl oxalate, while potassium ferricyanide is replaced by peroxidase, hematine, hemine or cobalt chloride. As the electrochemical analysis, a method in which a Clark type hydrogen peroxide electrode is used is generally adopted. A method in which hydrogen peroxide is caused to react with iodine ion in the presence of a catalyst such as peroxidase or molybdate and then the reaction product is measured with an iodine ion electrode can also be used. In one example of the fluorometric analysis, homovanillic acid is caused to react with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of peroxidase, and the fluorescent intensity of 2,2 dihydroxy 3,3 dimethoxybiphenyl 5,5 diacetic acid formed is measured. It is also possible to replace homovanillic acid with p hydroxyphenyl acetic acid or a diacetylfluorescein derivative e.g., diacetylfluorescein or diacetyldichlorofluorescein . As the spectrophotometric analysis, the peroxidase method and the catalase method are commonly employed. In the peroxidase method, an oxidizable color former is caused to react with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of peroxidase, and the color formed is determined with a colorimeter. Examples of the color former utilizable in this method are reagents that are used singly such as o dianisidine, 4 methoxy 1naphthol, and 2,2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid a combination of 4 aminoantipyrine with phenol compounds e.g., phenol, p chlorophenol and 2,4 ,6 tribromophenol , aniline compounds e.g.,N,N dimethylaniline and N,N diethylaniline or toluidine compounds e.g., N,N diethyl m toluidine , and a combination of 3 methyl 2 benzothiazolinone hydrazone with N,N dimethylaniline. In the catalase method, hydrogen peroxide is caused to react with an alcohol e.g., methanol in the presence of catalase, and the aldehyde formed is introduced into a color forming system in which the absorbance of the colored substance is measured, or the quantity of the aldehyde is determined by utilizing aldehyde dehydrogenase. All of the above described hydrogen peroxide detection methods are known in the art and can be reduced to practice through a known operation under known conditions.Determination method and means Basically, the method of the present invention comprises three steps, namely the G1DH reaction, the G1XD reaction and the detection of hydrogen peroxide. While these steps may be operated independently by a batchwise procedure, the determination of ammonia can be accomplished more efficiently and in a shorter period of time by employing a continuous autoanalyzing system using a reactor comprising an immobilized enzyme. Methods for immobilization of enzymes that are known in the art are broadly classified under the adsorption method, the covalent binding method, the matrix method and the microcapsule method. The immobilization method and immobilizing carrier can be suitably selected by reference to literature e.g.,Chibata, Ichiro ed. , Immobilized Enzymes , KodanshaK.K., Japan March 20, 1975 and Mosbach, K. ed. , Method in Enzymology , Vol. XLIV, Immobilized Enzymes,Academic Press, New York 1976 or publications e.g., Biomaterial Science Series No.l, Kaqaku no Ryoiki Journal of Japanese Chemistry , Special No.134,Nakano do K.K.,Japan April 20,1982 ,pp.55 67 69 79 depending upon the autoanalyzing system employed. With respect to the autoanalyzing system, literature e.g., Guilbaut,G.G., HANDBOOK OF ENZYMATIC METHODS OF ANALYSIS ,Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York 1976 , pp.445 612 and Methods in Enzymology mentioned supra may be referred to. The autoanalyzing system disclosed in JapaneseLaid Open Pub. No.47484 1983 is suitable for the practice of the present invention. According to this system, it is possible to determine the quantity cf ammonia or an ammonia producing substrate or to measure the activity of an ammonia producing enzyme in a period of time as short as around ten seconds. The autoanalyzing system comprises feeding a sample to be analyzed to a column packed with an immobilized enzyme, adding a luminol potassium ferricyanide, luminescence inducing agent to the liquid passing through the column and containing hydrogen peroxide formed by the enzyme reaction to induce chemiluminescence, introducing the liquid thus treated into a flow cell, and integrating the quantity of the chemiluminescence from the cell by means of a photon counter or photomultiplier through a luminescence receiver. FIG. 1 shows the basic structure of the apparatus used in the autoanalyzing system. In FIG. 1, a passage 1 for feeding a sample to be analyzed comprises a passage 2 for feeding a substrate or buffer solution, an inlet 3 for introducing the sample provided in the passage 2, and a column 4 packed with an immobilized enzyme. A passage 5 for feeding a luminescenceinducing agent, on the other hand, comprises a passage 6 for feeding a luminol solution and a passage 7 for feeding potassium ferricyanide provided in paralle, and a spiral tubular mixing coil 8 into which the passage 6 and 7 merge.The quantities of the solutions fed through the passage 2 for a buffer solution, the passage 6 for a luminol solution and the passage 7 for potassium ferricyanida are controlled by a peristaltic pump 9 so that the respective solutions can be fed at predetermined rates. The passage 1 fo feeding a sample to be analyzed and the passage 5 for weeding a luminescence inducing agent merge and are ccitnected with each other through a means for admixing t e two solutions quickly and homogeneously and are further connected to a flow cell 10 which, in turn, is c unnected to a photomultiplier 11 through a luminescen e receiving surface. In accordance with the present invention, the immobilized enzyme column comprises at lea immobilized G1DH and G1XD columns connected with each other. In the case of determination of an ammonia producing substrate by an enzyme reaction in which ammonia is formed, an immobilized ammonia producing enzyme column is additionally connected thereto.The quantity of each of the immobilized enzymes is determined by experimentation. When a reaction substrate or a coenzyme is required in the reaction in which ammonia is formed, a passage for feeding such a material is further provided as necessary.Examples In order to indicate more fully the nature and utility of this invention, the following specific examples of practice constituting preferred embodiments of the invention and a reference example are set forth, it being understood that these examples are presented as illustrative only and not intended to limit the scope of the invention.Example 1 Determination of ammonia The quantity of ammonia was determined by means of an autoanalyzer having an organization as shown inFIG. 1. 1 Preparation of immobilized enzyme column Enzymes were immobilized in accordance with theWeetall method. More particularly, 3 ml of a 2.5 glutaraldehyde solution was added to 200 mg of porous alkylamine glass particles pore size 500 A, and particle size 80 to 120 mesh, supplied by Pierce Co. , and the resultant mixture was deaerated. The reaction was thereafter allowed to proceed at room temperature under atmospheric pressure for 30 to 60 minutes. The glutaraldehyde solution was then removed, and the remaining glass particles were washed several times with distilled water.To the glass particles was added 1.0 ml of a G1DH solution 8500U, supplied by Toyobo,Japan in one instance and 2.0 ml of a G1XD solution 130U, see Reference Example set forth hereinafter in another instance, and the resultant mixtures were respectively caused to react at 40C overnight. In each case, the reaction solution was removed, and the remaining glass particles were washed at least three times with a suitable buffer solution and then with an aqueous solution of 1M sodium chloride. The immobilized enzymes thus obtained were packed into respective columns inner diameter 1 mm made of an acrylic resin to prepare immobilized enzyme columns, the G1DH column being 20 mm in length, theG1XD column being 8 mm in length. These columns were connected with each other in the order stated and assembled into the autoanalyzer. 2 Preparation of reagents Luminol solution 7 x 10 M luminol, 0.1M potassium hydroxide, 0.1M boric acid Potassium ferricyanide solution 2 xl0 2M Substrate buffer solution containing 1.4 mM a KG, 0.33 mM NADPH and 0.53 mM EDTA.2Na in 10 mM phosphate buffer solution pH 7.5 3 Determination procedure 1 111 of an aqueous ammonia solution of a known concentration was injected into the autoanalyzer through a microsyringe to measure the quantity of ammonia. The luminol solution, potassium ferricyanide solution and substrate buffer solution were supplied through the peristaltic pump 9 at a rate of 0.6 ml min. The relationship between the concentration of ammonia and the quantity of chemiluminescence was as shown by the calibration line illustrated in FIG. 2. Upon investigation of the optimum concentration of a KG and NADPH in this determination system, a linear calibration line could be obtained at an a KG concentration of 5 mg dl or higher and an NADPH concentration of 15 mg dl or higher, the ammonia concentration ranging from 0 to 30 mg dl.Example 2 Determination of urea An immobilized urease column 0.1 x 2 run was prepared as in Example 1 by using 10 mg of urease ca.200 U mg, supplied by Toyobo, Japan , and installed in the autoanalyzer of Example 1 shown in FIG. 1 in the order of immobilized urease, G1DH and G1XD columns. Subsequently, the quantity of urea was determined by the procedure of Example 1 using a urea solution of a known concentration. The relationship between the concentration of urea and the quantity of chemiluminescence was as illustrated in FIG. 3. The quantity of urea nitrogen in the blood was similarly measured using serum. The correlation between the values obtained from the same serum sample by means of a conventional auto analyzer for measuring the quantity of urea nitrogen in the blood ureaseindophenol method, Hitachi Model 726 and the autoanalyzer used in accordance with tiie present invention was found to be satisfactory as is shown in FIG. 4 n 63, correlation coefficient r 0.997, and regression line y 1.06x 0.36 . Example 3 Determination of urea nitrogen in the blood A continuous flow type autoanalyzing system for determination of urea nitrogen shown in the flow diagram of FIG. 5 was prepared. In FIG. 5, a passage 12 for feeding a sample and a passage 13 for feeding a substrate solution are introduced into a 3 inch dialyzer 14 where the substances fed merge. The mixture solution discharged from the dialyzer 14 is applied to an immobilized urease GlDH 1 2 column 15 1.5 x 10 mm and then introduced with dimethylaniline DMA solution fed through a passage 16 for DMA into a double mixing coil 17.The mixture solution discharged from the double mixing coil 17 is introduced with 4 aminoantipyrine 4AA fed through a passage 18 for 4AA into an immobilized G1XD column 19 1.5 x 10 mm , which is connected to a flow cell 20 15 mm, 590 nm colorimeter provided with a recorder 21. The immobilized enzyme columns were prepared as in Example 1. Reagents for determination were prepared from the following recipe. Substrate solution containing 60U dl peroxidase, 5 mg dl a KG and 30 mg dl NADPH in 50 mM phosphate buffer solution pH 7.5 4 Aminoantipyrine solution 41.3 mg dl 0,05M phosphate buffer solution pH 5.5 Dimethylaniline solution 108.8 pl dl 0.3N acetic acid solution Determination was performed by feeding to the analyzing system serum, physiological saline solution and air at a rate of 0.1 ml min., 0.8 ml min. and 0.6 ml min., respectively, through the passage 12 for a sample solution the substrate solution and air at a rate of 1.0 ml min. and 0.8 ml min., respectively, through the passage 13 for a substrate solution dimethylaniline solution at a rate of 0.16 ml min.through the passage 16 therefor and 4 aminoantipyrine at a rate of 0.16 ml min. through the passage 18 therefor. The double mixing coil 17 was maintained at a temperature of 480C. The correlation between the values thus obtained for urea nitrogen in the blood and those obtained by a conventional autoanalyzer Hitachi Model 726 in accordance with the urease indophenol method is shown in FIG. 6. A satisfactory correlation was obtained between the two methods n 69, correlation coefficient r 0.988, and regression line y l.lx 0.5 .Example 4 Determination of creatinine Immobilized creatinine deiminase, G1DH and GLAD. were prepared as in Example 1 to form columns of sizes 1.2 x 20 mm, 1.2 x 14 mm and 1.2 x 10 mm which were stacked in order. The stacked columns were installed in the analyzer shown in FIG. 1, and the quantity of creatinine was determined by the procedure of Example 1 using a creatinine solution of a known concentration.As a substrate solution, 10 mM phosphate buffer solution pH 7.5 containing 0.14 mM a KG and 0.044 mMNADPH was employed. The relationship between the concentration of creatinine and the quantity of chemiluminescence was as illustrated in FIG. 7, whereby a straight calibration line could be obtained.Reference Example Production of enzyme 20 g of wheat bran and 16 ml of water were charged into a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask and sterilized at 1200C for 30 minutes under pressure. The mixture thus sterilized was inoculated with Streptomyces sp.X 119 6 FERM P 6560 , which was cultivated at 280C for 7 days to prepare an inoculum. 200 g of wheat bran and 160 ml of water were charged respectively into 25 bottles of 5 literErlenmeyer flasks, and sterilized at 1200C for 30 minutes under pressure. The resulting mixture was aseptically inoculated with the inoculumn prepared in the manner described above, and cultivation was carried out at 280C for 2 days, and then at 200C for 2 weeks. The culture obtained was immersed in 37.5 liters of water and, after filtration, filtered with diatomaceous earth to obtain about 34 liters of a crude enzyme solution. To this crude enzyme solution was added ammonium sulfate to a 50 saturation. The precipitate thus formed was separated, dissolved in 3.9 liters of 0.02M acetate buffer solution pH 5.5 , and heated at 570C for 30 minutes. After cooling to 50C or lower, a twofold volume of cold ethanol was added to the resulting solution. The precipitate formed was separated, dissolved in 2 liters of 0.02M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.4 , and dialyzed overnight with the same buffer solution.The precipitate formed during the dialysis was removed while the supernatant was applied to a column 3.5 x 50 cm packed withDEAE cellulose equilibrated with 0.02M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.4 and eluted with 0.02M phosphate buffer solution containing 0.35M sodium chloride.Active fractions thus eluted were collected and dialyzed overnight with 0.05M acetate buffer solution pH 5.5 containing 0.05M sodium chloride. The inner dialyzed solution was applied to a column 2 x 10 cm packed with DEAE Sephrose CL 6B equilibrated with the same buffer solution, and eluted with 0.05 to 0.75M sodium chloride solution in accordance with the linear gradient method. Active fractions eluted were collected, concentrated by dialysis, and then subjected to gel filtration through a Sephadex G 200 column 2.5 x 120 cm . Active fractions thus obtained were collected and, after concentration, dialyzed with 0.02M potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.4 . The inner dialyzed solution was centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to precision filtration and thereafter to freeze drying to obtain 30 mg of a purified G1XD product specific activity 55.1 U mg protein, and yield 18.4 .
