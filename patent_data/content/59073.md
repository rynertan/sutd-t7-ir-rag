# Electrically operated mirror angle adjusting device.

## Abstract
The mirror 1 is pivotally connected to an actuator unit housing 3 containing two actuators. Two adjusting nuts each having a movable pivot 10, 11 are respectively movable by their actuators so as to adjust the angle of the mirror 1 . The device of the invention is characterized by having a first guide means and or a second guide means for controlling the direc tion of inclination, horizontal or vertical, of the mirror 1 so as to prevent the mirror from being obliquely displaced during the operation of the motor vehicle. The first guide means com prises a cruciform member 28 provided on the actuator unit housing 3 and a cruciform groove engaging therewith, pro vided on a mirror holder. The second guide means comprises openings 25 , longer in the horizontal or vertical direction, into which the adjusting nuts are respectively inserted.
