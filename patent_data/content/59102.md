# Crossover construction of thermal head.

## Abstract
A crossover construction is disclosed for a thermal head of thermal printer. The thermal head comprises a substrate insulated material 25, 26 a plurality of heat elements R disposed side by side in one row on the substrate a plurality of lower thin film conductor patterns 29 each of which connects to one of the heat elements through 28 and extends in direction X an insulating layer 30 disposed over the lower conductors a plurality of upper conductor patterns 31, 31 disposed in parallel in another direction Y on the insulating layer so as to form a crossover on the substrate for connecting selected heat elements to common power lines, the upper and lower conductors being selectively connected together through openings in the insulating layer the crossover construction characterized in that the insulating layer and the upper conductors comprise printed and cured pastes of insulating material and conductive material, respectively, each paste being of the low temperature curing type which can be cured at a temperature low enough not to affect the resis tance of the thin film lower conductors 24 , and that a metallic layer of low resistance 32 is coated on each of the upper conductors 31, 31 to improve its conductivity.
