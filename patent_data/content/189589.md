# AN ELECTRONIC BALANCE

## Abstract
A weighing unit 3 has a scale pan to which is applied the load W to be measured. The load is balanced by an electromagnetic force and the magnitude of the current required is output to discriminator 41 as a measure of the load. In the absence of the load 41 gives stand by output B to AND circuit 42 fed with periodic pulses α. Output β is produced and fed to an electromagnet in weighing unit 3 to lift a reference weight from the scale and replace it after a time determined by timer 44. On replacement of the reference weight an output γ from 42 actuates switches 45 and 48 for entry of measured value in register 46 via circuit D. With a load W on the scale from the output of 41 goes via circuit A to arithmetic unit 47 which corrects the measured value in proportion to the error in the measured value of the reference weight before the corrected value is displayed at 5.
