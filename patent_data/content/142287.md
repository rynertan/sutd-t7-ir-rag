# Adjustable hydraulic damper.

## Abstract
To ensure adjustability under all internal pressure conditions, a hydraulic damper having a hollow piston rod 42 , a piston 40 on the end of the rod slidable in a fluid filled tube 34 and co operating with the latter in defining inversely variable volume compression and rebound chambers 44 and 46 , and at least two relief valves 82 and 64 on the piston connected to the compression chamber for passing fluid thereto at two different levels of pressure relief includes a right cylindrical valve spool 65 in the piston rod bore 50 rotatable between a plurality of control positions corresponding to pressure relief at the different relief pressure levels, first passages 56 between the rebound chamber and the piston rod bore, second passages 62 between each of the relief valves and the piston rod bore, first circumferentially symmetrically arrayed ports 74 in the valve spool registrable with the first passages to always connect the rebound chamber to the valve spool, second circumferentially symmetrically arrayed ports 76 in the valve spool to selectively connect respective ones of the relief valves to the valve spool, and a hollow tube 68 through the valve spool and open to the compression chamber to equalize pressure on opposite ends of the valve spool.
