## Abstract
An automatic telephone message device for transmitting recorded messages to predetermined telephone numbers. The device is connected to the telephone jack and AC power source of the user s telephone, and is also connected to a standard tape recording system. One or more messages are recorded by the user on the tape recorder. The microproces sor controlled circuitry of this device provides memory space for convenient storage and modification of several telephone numbers. This device is responsive to manual, timed auto matic or remotely generated activation signals for transmit ting the recorded message to parties answering at the specified telephone numbers. An additional audible alarm may be set to sound at predetermined times, and if a manual switch is not closed within a specified time thereafter, the device calls the selected telephone numbers and transmits the recorded message. In response to remote transmitter activation or lack of response to the audible alarm, a tone is transmitted in addition to the message indicating that the user is probably in the vicinity of the device. All specified numbers are redialed until the device senses that they have been answered, or until a specified maximum number of dialing attempts have been made. The recorded message may be reviewed and the alarm activation time may be modified or deactivated by a party accessing the device from a remote telephone.
