# Apparatus for enhancing the use of electromechanical key telephone systems.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to apparatus for use with a telephone system having a plurality of stations each of which becomes active when the station goes off hook and one of a plurality of keys at the station is actuated for selecting one of a plurality of outside central office CO lines connected to the stations through a key service unit KSU . The apparatus of the present invention comprises a station control unit SCU associated with each station for connecting the same to the KSU and a main control unit MCU by which the KSU is connected to the outside CO lines. The MCU comprises a microprocessor operated central control and a multistate line control unit LCU operatively associated with each outside CO line for connecting each station in parallel to the selected CO line and or to the central control in accordance with the state of the LCU operatively associated with the selected CO line. The present invention provides for effecting addressing between the MCU and the SCU s and for controlling the state of the LCU s as a consequence of such addressing when the MCU is operative such that the MCU manages connections of the system to the CO lines and signalling between the stations according to a predeter mined plan contained in the control unit. With the arrange ment described above, the MCU intercepts and controls internal dialing from the stations of the system selectively controlling, for example, access of the stations, or indi viduals using the system, to the CO lines.
