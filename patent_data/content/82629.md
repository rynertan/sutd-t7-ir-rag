# SEALING EARTHEN DEPRESSIONS AGAINST LIQUID SEEPAGE

## Abstract
An earthen depression or pit 10 is sealed to reduce or prevent liquid 14 seepage therefrom into surrounding earth, by providing a seal 16 comprising an outer layer 18 and an inner layer 22 of water expandable colloidal clay e.g. bentonite and, sandwiched therebetween a layer 34 of granular material in which is maintained a fluid pressure in excess of that of the contents of the depression or pit. Hydrostatic liquid pressure may be used in the granular fill, in which case means for sensing the relative levels of the liquid in the fill and the liquid in the depression or pit, are provided.
