# CCD AREA IMAGE SENSOR AND METHOD FOR COLOR IMAGING

## Abstract
A solid state area image sensor for producing color video information comprises an array of like shaped, color responsive photoelements arranged in successive horizontal rows such that, except at the edges of the array, any one photoelement having one color response is surrounded by six adjacent photoelements all having color responses differing from the one surrounded photoelement, in an approximately hexagonal array. Color video information is produced in response to combined signals from three mutually adjacent photoelements by processing the photo element output signals two rows at a time and producing color video information in response to signals from three mutually adjacent photoelements of three different color responses in adjacent rows. The three different color re sponses are white w , yellow Ye , and cyan Cy , and luminance L and chrominance RGB information is pro duced in accordance with the equations L Cy Ye 0.66aW R W Cy G Cy Ye W B W Ye where L is luminance, R is red, G is green, B is blue and a is an adjustable quantity near unity.
