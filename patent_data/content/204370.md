## Description
The present invention pertains to novel hydraulic cement compositions and to the use of same for cementing void spaces in subterranean formations. Such invention also pertains to foamable and foamed hydraulic cement compositions having, after foaming and hardening, relatively high strength as a function of density. Pumpable aqueous hydraulic cement slurries are known as is the use thereof in plugging off or sealing void spaces in subterranean formations such as, for example, in cementing the annulus between a well casing and the borehole in gas, oil, and geothermal wells, etc. in plugging abandoned wells or mine shafts in grouting mine shafts and the like. Additionally, it is also known that the afore mentioned aqueous hydraulic cement slurries can be foamed i.e., so as to incorporate discrete, stable gas bubbles therein and thereby effectively reducing the density of said slurry and of the cement mass resulting upon the hardening thereof by incorporating a foaming agent material in said slurry and thereafter vigorously admixing the resulting slurry with a gaseous material. Such technique is particularly useful in those instances wherein it is desired to place a long column of cement in a relatively weak subterranean formation e.g., a formation which would be prone to fracture under the hydrostatic head associated with non foamed conventional cement slurries in their normal density ranges . Unfortunately, however, the foaming of a particular cement slurry of a given density to a lower density generally results in the hardened cement foam material having a lower compressive strength than a non foamed mass of the denser neat cement slurry would have had upon hardening. Accordingly, even though these known foamed cement systems do have definite and distinct benefits and advantages, such systems are not without limitations as to the realm of their practical utility. Further, it is additionally known from previously published experimentation that the water to cement ratio in foamed aqueous cement slurries has a major effect on the strength of the resulting foamed cement after hardening. That is, at a given post foaming density, the higher the starting non foamed slurry density is, the higher will be the strength development of the resulting foamed cement. See Low Density Foam Cements Solve Many Oil Field Problems , Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to develop, discover or identify foaming agent materials which would be compatible with the aforementioned dispersing agent materials and which would thereby facilitate the preparation of foamable aqueous cement slurries having densities in excess of 14.5 lbs gallon using presently available full scale oil field cement mixing and pumping equipment. It has now been discovered that a certain class of ammonium salts of sulfated ethoxylated higher aliphatic alcohols are compatible with various dispersing agent materials e.g., such as alkali metal salts of sulfonated polynaphthalene formaldehyde, sulfonated and or aminated lignin based materials, alkali metal halide salts such as sodium chloride, organic acids such as citric acid, polyacrylate materials, and the like and that such sulfated ethoxylated aliphatic alcohol ammonium salts are therefore effective as foaming agents for aqueous hydraulic cement slurries containing said dispersing agent materials. Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention is a foamable aqueous hydraulic cement slurry comprising hydraulic cement, water, a dispersing agent and a foaming agent component comprising the ammonium salt of a sulfated ethoxylated C₆ to about C₁₂ aliphatic alcohol. In another aspect, the present invention is a method for cementing a void space in a subterranean formation comprising preparing the aforementioned foamable aqueous hydraulic cement slurry intimately admixing said aqueous slurry with a gaseous material so as to form discrete stable gas bubbles of said gaseous material throughout said slurry and emplacing the resulting gasified aqueous slurry into said subterranean void and permitting same to harden therein. The various embodiments of the present invention are particularly advantageous in the sense that they represent a practical means for providing the types of relatively low density oil gas well cementing formulations which are needed for weak and or fracture sensitive formations while at the same time retaining exceptionally good strength characteristics. Indeed, it has been found that hardened foamed cements prepared according to the present invention, even at densities as low as about 8 lb gallon, had sufficient strength and integrity to withstand conventional perforation and fracturing operations. When foamed cement slurry density is referred to herein, it is to be understood as corresponding to the density as measured under normal laboratory conditions e.g., atmospheric pressure and at a temperature in the range of from about 70 to about 80 F unless otherwise specified. Hydraulic cement materials suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include any of those conventionally used for subterranean cementing operations e.g., in oil, gas and or geothermal well cementing operations mine shaft grouting and in mine cementing applications and the like . Examples of such suitable hydraulic cement materials include the known classes of Portland cement materials, high alumina cement materials, etc. with the commonly used oil field grade Portland cements e.g., API Class A, C, G and H and ASTM Types I, II and III being particularly preferred. As has been noted, dispersing agent materials are employed in the compositions of the present invention for the purpose rendering the aqueous cement slurries hereof transportable e.g., pumpable by conventional handling equipment e.g., conventional oil field positive displacement pumping equipment etc. even at relatively high slurry densities such as, for example, in excess of 14.5 lbs gallon and more particularly in excess of 16 or 16.5 lb. gallon. Suitable dispersing agent materials for use for such purpose include any of those cement additives which are known to notably reduce the apparent viscosity of an aqueous cement slurry at a given density level. Representative examples of such suitable dispersing agent materials include alkali metal salts of sulfonated polynaphthalene formaldehyde condensation products, sulfonated and or aminated lignin based materials, alkali metal halide salts such as sodium chloride, organic acids such as citric acid, polyacrylate materials, and the like. The amount of the aforementioned dispersing agent materials employed in the practice of the present invention is, functionally speaking, an amount sufficient to render the cement slurry of concern capable of being pumped and sufficiently fluid to permit entrainment of gases prior to placement in the desired subterranean formation e.g., pumpable using conventional cement mixing and handling equipment e.g., conventional positive displacement oil field serving pumps, and the like . More preferably, such dispersing agent is typically employed in an amount sufficient to cause the cement slurry of concern to have a viscosity, in freshly prepared form, of less than about 300 centipoise at 200 sec While the amount of dispersing agent employed in practice to accomplish the aforestated function may, in numerical or quantitative terms, vary depending upon the precise compositional make up on the slurry of concern, such amount will generally be within the range of from about 0.01 to about 10 preferably from about 0.1 to about 2 weight percent based upon the weight of the hydraulic cement material. Foaming agent materials which have been found to be compatible with the aforementioned dispersing agent additives can be generally described as being ammonium salts of sulfated ethoxylated C₆ to about C₁₂ aliphatic alcohol materials. More preferably, such foaming agent materials are the ammonium salts of sulfated ethylene oxide adducts of C₈ to about C₁₂ fatty alcohol materials e.g., ammonium salts of sulfated ethoxylated C₈ to about C₁₂ fatty alcohols . Most preferably, such foaming agent materials are the ammonium salts of a sulfated ethoxylated fatty alcohol which correspond to the formula The amount of the aforementioned foaming agent material employed for the purposes of the present invention is not particularly critical so long as it is an amount sufficient to cause the aqueous hydraulic cement slurry of interest to be foamable in character. As a general rule however said foaming agent will be employed in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 15 weight percent based upon the weight of the hydraulic cement material and will more preferably be employed in an amount of from about 0.5 to about 5 weight percent on the indicated hydraulic cement material weight basis. In addition to the foregoing ingredients, the hydraulic cement compositions of the present invention can, if desired, contain various known conventional additive materials in their usual proportions. Thus, for example, conventional setting accelerators such as calcium chloride, etc. can be employed in their customary proportions e.g., from about 0.1 to about 5 weight percent based upon the hydraulic cement material if desired in a given instance. Similarly, conventional extender additives such as, for example, anhydrous alkali metal especially sodium metasilicates can be employed in similar proportions when and as desired for a particular purpose. Indeed, it has been observed that the use of each of the foregoing optional additives particularly in combination has a surprisingly bene ficial inpact upon the stability of the foamed cement compositions of the present invention and particularly for those based upon Class H Portland cement and formed from especially dense starting point slurries e.g., those in the 17 to 20 lb gallon slurry density range . In addition to the foregoing additives, conventional relatively light weight pozzolanic materials such as fly ash can also be employed in the cementing compositions of the present invention and, when used, such materials can be employed in relatively large proportions such as, for example, in amounts ranging up to about 75 weight percent based upon the weight of the hydraulic cement materials. Furthermore, other types of commonly used cement additives such as retarders, weighting agents e.g., in amounts typically ranging from about 1 to about 65 weight percent based upon the weight of the hydraulic cement materials and including commonly used weighting materials such as for example, ilmenite, barite, hematite and the like , fluid loss control additives and the like can also be employed in conjunction with the foamable cement slurries of the present invention. In preparing the foamable aqueous hydraulic cement slurries of the present invention conventional oil well cement formulation, mixing and foaming tech niques and equipment may be suitably employed. Preferably, however, the hydraulic cement material and the various aforementioned additives which are in dry powder form will first be thoroughly dry blended and the resulting dry blend will then be thoroughly admixed e.g., either batch wise or continuously first with the desired amount of mix water and with any desired additives in liquid form and subsequently with the gaseous material to be employed as the operative foam forming ingredient. The amount of mix water employed can vary substantially and the actual amount employed will primarily depend upon the initial slurry density desired for the non foamed but foamable starting point slurry composition. While such initial slurry density can range from fairly low densities e.g., such as in the 10 to 12 lb gallon range to fairly high densities e.g., in excess of the 14.5, especially from about 15 to about 21, lb gallon range , the hereinbefore described most pronounced, desirable and advantageous benefits of the present invention are obtained when said initial slurry densities are controlled to within the above noted relatively high density region. Accordingly, it is generally preferred that the mix water be employed in an amount ranging from about 25 to about 50 more preferably from about 25 to about 35 parts by weight based upon the weight of the hydraulic cement material. The gaseous material employed to foam the above described foamable cement composition can suitably be any gaseous material capable of forming stable, discrete gas bubbles throughout the aqueous cement slurry of interest. From the practical standpoints of safety, cost and ready availability, however, it is generally preferred to employ typically in compressed form air or nitrogen as the gaseous material of choice. The amount of gaseous material employed in a given instance will of course vary as a function of specific results e.g., final foam density etc. desired in such instance. As a general rule however, said gaseous material will be incorporated into the aqueous cement slurry in an amount sufficient to reduce the density of said slurry at ambient temperature and normal atmospheric pressure by at least about 1 lb gallon. In an especially preferred embodiment of the present invention the density of the aqueous cement slurry prior to the incorporation of said gaseous material is from about 15 to about 21 lbs gallon and the density thereof at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure following the incorporation of said gaseous material is in the range of from about 6 to about 19 most preferably from about 8 to about 16 lb gallon. The following examples will serve to further illustrate and exemplify the present invention and the various features and aspects thereof. In this example, a series of foamed cement samples are prepared and tested for 24 hour compressive strength development. In conducting these experiments, a dry cement blend is prepared by admixing a Class H Portland cement with 0.5 weight percent based on weight of cement BWOC of the sodium salt of a sulfonated polynaphthalene formaldehyde condensate dispersant , 1 weight percent BWOC of calcium chloride accelerator and 1 weight percent BWOC of anhydrous sodium silicate extender . Various amounts of said dry blended mixture are blended with distilled water in a 1200 ml. stainless steel, screwed top Waring Blender to provide aqueous cement slurries of different densities ranging from 16.5 to 17.44 lb gallon. In preparing said slurry, the water and dry blend mix is blended for 15 seconds at lo speed and is then switched to hi speed for 30 seconds. Thereafter 0.5 weight percent BWOC of a solution of 85 weight percent of the ammonium salt of a sulfated ethoxylated C The resulting foamed slurry is then poured into a 2 x 2 x 2 cubical greased mold and is permitted to harden in the mold for 24 hours in a 80 5 F water bath. Thereafter, the compressive strength of the resulting foamed cement specimens is determine pursuant to API Specifications for Materials and Testing for Well Cements, Section 7.9. The compositional details and compressive strength results for each of various foamed cement samples are summarized in Table I below. In addition, results are presented in Table I for comparative purposes for foam samples in which lower starting point density slurries are employed employing no dispersant material and a different surfactant as the foaming agent and for a run corresponding to those described above except that the sulfated ethoxylated fatty alcohol foaming agent material is not employed therein. As can be seen from the results in Table I, at a given post foaming density 24 hour compressive strengths which are generally substantially higher are provided by starting with a relatively high initial i.e., unfoamed slurry density e.g., 16.5 or 17.44 lb gallon as opposed to a relatively lower initial slurry density e.g., such as 14.2 lb gallon . As has been noted previously, the indicated higher density slurries typically require the use of a dispersant or superplasticizer additive to render them capable of handling with conventional oil field mixing and pumping equipment. As has also been noted, most commonly available surfactant materials such as, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, alkyl diphenyl oxide disulfonate salts, alkyl phosphates, etc. have been found to be incompatible with said dispersing agent materials and thus ineffective for use as foaming agents in the practice of the present invention. In this example, several commercially available surfactant materials are subjected to a screening test to evaluate their suitability for use as foaming agents for dispersing agent containing hydraulic cement slurries. The aqueous hydraulic cement slurry recipe employed in such testing is as follows In carrying out such screening test procedure, the cement and dispersing agent are first thoroughly blended together the water is placed in a 1200 ml stainless steel screw top Waring Blender and the dry cement dispersing agent mixture is added thereto. The resulting mixture is mixed at lo speed for 15 seconds and then the foaming agent candidate of interest is added and the mixture is agitated for 30 seconds at hi speed. Acceptable foaming agent materials are those which produce a full blender cup of foamed material within the first 10 seconds or so of agitation. This is typically accompanied by or detectable in the stainless steel blender cup with an audibly noticeable increase in the pitch of the blender s agitator. Unacceptable foaming agent candidates are those which fail to cause the blender cup to be filled as evidenced by the absence of a cavitation whine even after the full 30 seconds of agitation at hi blender speed. The various surfactants screened according to the foregoing test procedure are identified in Table II below along with a summary of the evaluation results. As can be seen from the results in Table II, suitability or operability as foaming agents in the dispersant containing hydraulic cement compositions of the present invention is highly selective and critical and indicates that the foaming agent employed should be an ammonium salt of a sulfated, ethoxylated higher e.g., C₆ to about C₁₄ and especially C₈ to about C₁₂ aliphatic alcohol material. Additional testing with several other com mercially available surfactant materials has further confirmed the necessity or importance of employing the indicated type of foaming agent materials in the practice of the present invention. In this example, a series of foamed cement samples are prepared having densities in the range of about 9.4 to about 10 lb gallon from relatively high density aqueous slurries having initial densities ranging from about 17 to about 20.2 lb gallon. Each of the slurries employ an API Class H Portland cement and contain 1.75 BVOW of a foaming agent composed of 15 weight percent propylene glycol and 85 weight percent of the ammonium salt of a sulfated, ethoxylated C The compositional details and results for this series of experiments are summarized in Table III below. As can be seen from the results in Table III, it is preferable to utilize extender and accelerator additive such as anhydrous sodium metasilicate and calcium chloride, respectively when working with the relatively higher initial density e.g., 17 lb gallon and above API Class H Portland cement slurries. While the practice of the present invention has been illustrated and described by reference to particular examples and embodiments thereof, such is not to be interpreted as in any way limiting the scope of the instantly claimed invention.
