# POLYVINYL ALCOHOL VINYL ACETATE ETHYLENE INTERPOLYMERS HAVING OXYGEN BARRIER PROPERTIES

## Abstract
A polyvinyl alcohol vinyl acetate ethylene interpolymer is described which demonstrates good oxygen barrier properties as a dried latex film. The interpolymer contains about 1 40 wt ethylene and is prepared by the aqueous emulsion polymerization of vinyl acetate and ethylene in the presence of at least about 15 wt polyvinyl alcohol, preferably greater than about 20 wt , based on polyvinyl alcohol and vinyl acetate, which polyvinyl alcohol is substan tially incorporated into the interpolymer. Packaging mate rials for oxygen sensitive substances such as bottles, containers, sheets, thin films and the like are characterized by an oxygen permeability of less than 0.4 cc 100 inÂ² 24 hr cm Hg mil at 25 C and 0 relative humidity.
