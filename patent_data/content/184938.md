## Description
Wave Pump Assembly The present invention relates in general to pumping devices for pumping liquid or gaseous or plastic fluids or mixtures of solids and gaseous or liquid fluids, and more particularly to wave pump assemblies having a rotor member in the form of a helix with smooth, rounded threads and means activated by the helix to generate a continuous wave motion providing longitudinally moving.pockets for moving the medium to be pumped. The invention also relates to extruder screw assemblies for extruding polymers and the like, and more particularly to an extruder screw and positive displacement wave pump structure for extruding plastics and the like. Heretofore, various pumping devices have been proposed to effect pumping of a medium, such as liquid or gaseous fluids of various types, by a pump structure involving a helical rotor, usually having rounded helical threads, and a stator also providing a bore which is of rounded helical configuration having a different pitch from the helical rotor, providing pumping pockets which progress longitudinally from the input end to the output end of the pump. A number of such pump devices have been developed and marketed by Robins Myers Inc. ofSpringfield, Ohio, under the narae Moyno gear pumps, involving principles of pump structure disclosed in various U.S. patents to R.J.L. Moineau. Examples of these patents are U.S. Patents Nos. 1,892,217 and 2,028,407. However, certain disadvantages have been identified as an inherent property of that type of construction.With the Moineau type pump, either the rotor or the stator must be free to orbit around the center of rotation of the input drive shaft or other driving mechanism. Thin is because of the nature of the Moineau type pump wherein the confronting surfaces of the rotor and stator are rounded helical thread configurations of different pitch providing pumping pockets which progress longitudinally from the input to th,ek output end of the positive displacement pump mechanism.Because of the necessity of enabling either the rotor or the stator, usually the rotor, to orbit around the center of rotation of the input shaft, a rather complex coupling must be provided between the drive shaft and the input end of the rotor of the pump mechanism to allow this relative movement of the center of rotation of the pump rotor relative to the center of rotation of the drive shaft. An object of the present intention is the provision of a novel positive displacement pump assembly employing a helical rotor with smooth rounded helical threads, which eliminates the need for a coupling to accommodate orbiting of the pump rotor, and provides for greater capactiy for a given rotor length and thread pitch than Moineau type pumps, and provides continuous and positive displacement pumping of the fluid or other flow medium by generating a continuous wave motion providing volume displacement which is utilized more efficiently to pump the medium. Employment of a screw or the like in an extruder for working wide ranges of solid, plastic material into a substantially homogeneous molten state suitable for formation into any desired shape by extrusion or injection into a die or mould has become well known. Extrusion, injection moulding or blow moulding with a single screw extruder includes feeding the solid polymeric or plastics material in pellet, chip, powder, or flake form to the feed end of the extruder through a hopper mounted on an opening of a heated barrel in which a screw is rotatably mounted. The screw has at least one helical thread with a minimum clearance to the barrel, integrally formed on the core to create a helical channel, along which the plastics material is moved downstream from the feed end to the discharge end by forces exerted by the rotation of the screw. The solid plastics material fed into the screw channel is compacted into a solid plug or solid bed and the solid bed melts as it travels down the screw channel.The molten plastics material is collected by the wiping action of the thread into a melt pool. The melt pool gradually increases as the solid bed gradually melts, eventually occupying the entire screw channel. Molten plastics materials have a very high viscosity and a large amount of heat is generated in the melt pool due to shearing of the melt pool by the rotatiqn of the screw. Thus, the melt pool becomes hotter as it travels down the screw channel and often becomes undesirably hot by the time it reaches the discharge end. Heat transfer from the melt pool to the solid bed is inefficient because f the low thermal conductivity of plastics materials and the limited contact area between the melt pool and the solid bed.Increased heat transfer from the hot, molten plastics material in the melt pool to the cold, solid plastics material in the solid bed is highly desirable in order to reduce the temperature of the molten plastic material discharged from the extruder, increase melting capacity of the extruder and the increase energy efficiency of the extrusion process. Examples of extruder screws which have come into substantial use for wot zing plastic material and feeding it by extrusion or injection into a die or mould are found in Robert A. Barr, U.S. Patent No. 3,698,541, Chan I. Chung, U.S. Patent No. 4,000,884, and more recently an energy efficient extruder screw disclosed in Chung and Barr, U.S. Patent No. 4,405,239. These can be broadly described as a screw having a first or main screw thread and a second screw thread which divides the screw channel into a pair of side by side sub channels of equal width. The diameter of the second thread is sufficiently smaller than the diameter of the barrel that its clearance to the barrel allows the plastics material to flow over the second thread.The depths of the two side by side sub channels vary continuously and oppositely along the length of the passages so that the combined passage cross sectional area of the two sub channels is maintained constant. As one sub channel becomes smaller in depth with diminishing cross sectional area, the other sub channel becomes deeper correspondingly with enlarging crosssectional area, so that the plastic material is forced to move from the diminishing sub channel into the enlarging sub channel, flowing over the second thread. The second thread gives shear to the plastics material while the material is flowing over it. Such a mechanism of moving the plastics material from one sub channel into the other sub channel is repeated a number of times. It is well known in the plastics and rubber industries that such a single screw type of extruder is not a positive displacement device. This means that the restriction to flow downstream of the extruder which creates high pressure at the extruder outlet reduces the pumping rate of the extruder. To obtain higher rates, it is then necessary to run the extruder at higher revolutions per minute. This has the disadvantage of raising the temperature of the extruder, owing to the increasing shear, eventually beyond what is tolerable to the process. It has been known in the industry that the pressure on the extruder can be reduced to very low levels by using a positive displacement pump, such as a gear pump, between the extruder and process die.Driven separately, this is able to pump against very severe flow restrictions, where high pressures occur, and yet provide very low pressure at the pump inlet, which is the extruder outlet, enabling the extruder to perform at much higher revolution rates. However, the gear pump drive system and the in line space it takes up make it an expensive and troublesome addition and a real problem to add to existing lines. The invention provides a wave pump assembly for pumping fluid medium comprising gaseous or liquid fluids or mixtures thereof with solids or the like, comprising a barrel having an upstream end and an outlet end, and a positive displacement wave pump in the bore located between the said upstream end and the said outlet end, characterised in that the said pump has a rotor member having a helically contoured outer surface defining a plural turn helical thread formation of wide rounded form to orbit about a central axis, means arranged in operation to drive the rotor member for rotation, a slide disc stack of a plurality of slidable sealing discs in face to face contact with each other extending along the wave pump, and means supporting the discs for reciprocative sliding movement parallel to a first diametric plane of the barrel, the barrel having confronting surface portions facing the discs along the extent of the slide disc stack, the slide discs forming sealing discs having opposite surface edge portions to be moved towards the confronting surface portions of the barrel into sealing engagement therewith and be withdrawn to a range of positions spaced from the said surface portions of the barrel towards the central axis by the rotor member upon rotation of the latter, the discs having shaped central apertures receiving the rotor member through them and accommodating movement of the full diametric range of movement of the crests of the said helical thread formation in a second diametric direction perpendicular to the said first diametric plane, the rotor and sealing slide discs and the confronting surface of the barrel forming a series of pumping pockets between the convex outer edge portions of the sealing discs and the surface of t,le barrel which pumping pockets are moved longitudinally through the pump to force the fluid medium to move toward the discharge end of the positivedisplacement wave pump and the rotor and bounding surfaces of the said apertures of the discs also forming pumping pockets to force the fluid medium to move through the said aperture towards the said discharge end.

The assembly may comprise drive shaft means journaled for rotation in the bore, the means arranged to drive the rotor member comprising means coupling the rotor member to the discharge end portion of the drive shaft to be driven thereby. The invention also provides a screw extruder assembly for plasticating or melting solid plastics material or plastic material or the like, comprising a wave pump assembly according to the invention and a screw rotatably housed in an upstream portion of the bore having a feed end and a discharge end, the said screw having a section between the feed end and discharge end thereof comprising at least one helical thread having plural turns integral with the core of the screw, the said thread originating at the feed end of the screw creating a helical channel in the space between successive turns of the thread and having a minimum clearance to the surface of the bore to feed the plastic material along the screw from the feed end to the discharge end, the positive displacement wave pump being located between the discharge end of the screw and the outlet end of the bore. The rotor member of the wave pump may then include an axially short cylindrical upstream end portion to be removably assembled to the discharge end of the screw and having a downstream end portion of smaller diametric size than the diameter of the helically contoured rotor portion.

Referring to the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference characters designate corresponding parts throughout the several figures and initially toFigures 1 to 8, one form of screw extruder and positive displacement pump assembly according to the present invention includes a cylindrical barrel 2 of the extruder having a single screw extruder 1, which may have the specific construction of a number of extruder screws, such as the extruder screw disclosed in United States PatentNo. 4,000,884 Chung , or U nited States Patent No.3,698,541 Barr , or united States Patent No. 3,858,856 Hsu or other known commerial extruder screws, but will be described as an extruder screw as disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 4,405,239 in the present example. In the screw extruder assembly, the outlet end portion of the extruder screw 1 is coupled, by a structure described below, to a positive displacement pump structure indicated by the reference numeral 15 occupying a zone of the cylindrical barrel 2 adjacent to the outlet end. The extruder screw 1 has at least one helical thread 4 with a minimum clearance to the barrel 2 integrally mounted or formed on its core la. The thread 4 creates a helical channel 5 extending around the core la of the screw 1. The number of turns of thread 4 around the core la will be called hereinafter, turns for brevity.The axial distance between one turn of thread 4 is called pitch . A solid plastics material, or a mixture of materials, in pellets, chip, powder or flake form is fed into the channel 5 through a hopper not shown and travels down the channel 5 propelled by forces exerted by rotation of the screw 1. At a point A,a short distance from the feed end of the screw 1, a portion of the width of the channel 5 toward the feed end starts gradually to decrease its depth while the remaining portion of the width of the channel, toward the discharge end, starts gradually to increase its depth.A second thread 10, which is substantially parallel to the thread 4, originates at a point B downstream of the point A, rising from the floor of the channel 5 and divides the channel into two sub channels, a front subchannel 11 and a back sub channel 12. The second thread 10 has a larger clearance to the barrel 2 than does the first thread 4, the larger clearance being comparable to but not less than the depth of the front channel portion at the point B. The second thread 10 converts to become the thread 4 that is to say, the thread with a minimum clearance to the barrel at C while the thread 4 converts to become the second thread 10 that is to say, the thread with a larger clearance to the barrel at D which is located on the thread 4 substantially level with and adjoining C towards the discharge end. The maximum depth of the front sub channel 11 is maintained betweenC and E which is located at about one half to one turn, preferably, about one turn, toward the discharge end fromC. The structural features between B and D are repeated between D and a further point F in substantially the same way, causing a major portion of the plastic material, both solid and molten, collected in the front sub channel 11, to move back into the back sub channel 12 again by the forces exerted by the rotation of screw 1.The movement of the plastic material from one sub channel to the other over the second thread 10 is always in the direction opposite to the direction of the general movement along the screw 1 from the feed end to the discharge end, That requires a high pressure buildup in whichever sub channel is delivering material to the other, and the high pressure can cause undesirable heat buildup and reduction in the pumping capacity of the screw 1. The structural features between B andD may be repeated in substantially the same way as many times as desired between the point F and a further point G at which the second thread 10 terminates. The depths of the front sub channel 11 and the back subchannel 12 and the clearance of the second thread 10 may be different from those used between B and D in each repeat cycle in order to achieve the optimum mixing and melting functions of the screw 1.The front subchannel 11 and the back sub channel 12 merge to become a single channel by gradually changing their depths to a common depth at a point H which is located about one half to one turn towards the discharge end from the point G. Instead, the second thread 10 may be present between the points G and H, terminating at the point H.The depth of the channel 5 is usually kept constant from the point H to the discharge end of the screw The positive displacement wave pump 15 is coupled to the discharge end ID of the extruder screw 1 by simply threading the upstream end of a rotor member 16 of the wave pump to the downstream end of the extruder screw. The positive displacement wave pump 15 comprises a rotatable internal element forming the rotor 16, the outer exterior surface of which includes a cylindrical upstream end portion 17 having a hollow cavity 17A which is internally threaded and is assembled onto a correspondingly externally threaded discharge end formation lD on the extruder screw 1 to permit the rotor to be assembled to and disassembled from the extruder screw by conventional screw threading techniques.A downstream end portion 18 of the rotor 16 is of smaller diameter than the upstream end portion 17 and is of hexagonal configuration, as is best shown in Figures 6 and 7, to receive a hex socket wrench or similar tool to facilitate removal of the rotor 16 from the extruder screw section 1 when desired. The portions of the rotor 16 between the cylindrical upstream end portion 17 and the hexagonal downstream smaller cross section end portion 18 form a helically contoured section 19 similar to the configuration of the exterior surface of the rotor of a Moyno gear pump of the types produced commercially byRobbins Myers, Inc. and embodying the principles disclosed in U.S. patents to R.J.L. Moineau, such asU.S. Patents Nos. 1,892,217 and 2,028,407. The helically contoured outer surface of the helical rotor portion 19 defines what may be described as helical threads of wide, rounded form forming a plurality of rounded helical threads or turns orbiting about an axis that is a notional extension of the central axis of the extruder screw 1 and is the central axis of the inlet cylindrical rotor portion 17 and of the downstream end portion 18.A stator frame assembly indicated generally by the reference numeral 20 spans most of the axial length of the rotor 16, and includes a first frame member having an inlet portion 21 and a side frame portion 22 integrally joined together and an outlet end member 23 collectively outwardly surrounding the rotor 16 and capturing a stack of slide discs 24 forming sealing discs and shown most clearly in Figures 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8A to 8C. The stator frame member 20 has a cylindrical outer perimeter 20a along the two horizontally opposite lateral portions thereof over the span of the inlet portion 21, the side frame portions 22 and the outlet end member 23, conforming to the inner diameter of the cylindrical confronting surface of the barrel or bore of the extruder tube 2, to fit tightly against the confronting surface of the extruder barrel or bore and be fixed thereagainst by any suitable means. As will be apparent particularly from Figures 2, 3, 6, and 7, the inlet end portion of the stator frame member 20 has a beveled or chamfered throat 25 forming a truncated conical surface coaxial with the rotor 16 and converging downstream to join a cylindrical inlet passage portion 26 which extends to a shoulder formation 27 forming an upstream bearing shoulder for the stack of slide discs 24. The opposite side frame portions 22 of the stator frame member 20 extending from the inlet portion 21 to the outlet end member 23 have a cylindrical outer or exterior surface 20a and a flat or rectilinear inner surface 22b defining guide surfaces for opposite lateral edges or flats of the slide discs 24 limiting them to rectilinear reciprocative sliding movement parallel to the vertical direction as seen in the drawings only. The downstream end of the slide frame portion 22 of the stator frame member 20 has an annular tongue formation 28 which fits a correspondingly shaped groove formation 29 in the outlet end member 23 to couple together the outlet end member and the stator frame portions 22. The upstream end portion of the outlet end member 23 provides an axially elongate annular lip or flange formation 30 with a downstream facing shoulder that abuts a transition shoulder portion 28a of the annular tongue formation 28 and provides an upstream annular shoulder face 31 confronting the slide disc 24 at the downstream end of the pack of slide discs, coactive with the shoulder formation 27 of the inlet portion 21 to capture the stack of slide discs 24 therebetween. As will be seen particularly from Figs. 6 and 7, the outlet member 23 has a cylindrical bore portion 32 coaxial with the rotor 16 and with a diameter equal to the length of the major axis of the elliptical or oblong central opening of the slide discs 24 as later described, which merges into an outwardly beveled or flared frustoconical surface portion 33 forming the discharge or outlet opening for the extruder. Diametrically opposite portions of this beveled surface 33 are provided with openings 34 communicating with passages 34a at the top and bottom of the intermediate regions of the body of the outlet end member 23 which open in an upstream direction to spaces 35A and 35B above and below, respectively, cylindrically curved arcuate upper and lower edge portions 36 and 37 of the discs 24. As will be apparent from Figs. 8A 8C, all of the discs 24 are of identical configuration. The outer edge of each disc 24 is in the shape of a twice interrupted or truncated circular or cylindrical shape, being interrupted by two symmetrically diametrically opposite flats or straight edge sections 28 and 39 along chords of the circle in which the upper and lower arcuate cylindrical edges 36 and 37 lie, providing parallel vertically extending straight edge surfaces 38 and 39 which slidably bear against confronting surfaces of the side frame portions 22 of the stator frame member 20.Thus the stator frame member 20 maintains the pack of sealing discs 24 in a face to face contacting stacked array of discs capable of freely sliding vertically relative to each other along a vertical axis through the centre of the barrel or bore 2 of the extruder paralleling the planes of the vertical flats or straight edges 38 and 39. The central opening 40 of each of the discs 24 is in the form of a laterally elongate oval having a vertical minor axis 40a and a horizontal major axis 40b to accommodate the maximum lateral span of the crests of the rounded helical threads of the rotor 16.The dimension. of the minor axis 40a corresponds exactly to the diameter of the rotor 16 in the cylindrical portions thereof and the diameter of any circular crosssection of the helical thread portion thereof, so that the discs 24 are shifted vertically up and down relative to each other to provide wave patterns resembling what is illustrated in Figures 2 and 6, providing pumping pockets which progress longitudinally from the inlet end to the outlet or discharge end of the wave pump section as the helically threaded rotor 16 is rotated by the extruder screw section 1. By the above described construction, wherein the positive displacement wave pump section 15 is coupled to and driven by the extruder screw section 1, the plastic material being forced towards the discharge or delivery end of the extruder screw section 1 by the threads of the extruder screw flows into the passages or spaces lying outwardly of the outer periphery of the upstream inlet portion 21 of the stator frame member 20, between the inlet portion of the stator frame member and the confronting surface of the barrel 2 of the extruder, and thence into the spaces between the convex arcuate cylindrical edges 36 and 37 of the sealing slide discs 24 and the confronting surface of the barrel 2, and the material being extruded also flows into the throat 25 of the inlet end portion 21 of the stator frame member 20 and passes into the spaces occurring between the ovalshaped central openings 40 of the discs 24 at the outer regions of the major axis 40b thereof and the exterior surface of the circular cross section rotor 16. Since the surfaces of the openings 40 of the discs 24 contact the exterior surface of the rotor 16 all along its length down the centre line of the pump, this contact creates a sealing line, preventing the polymer from leaking back so that it must move with the volume being displaced by the rotor shape as it rotates.Also, the convex arcuate curved outer surfaces 24a of the discs are positioned in a pattern and progressively brought into contact with the confronting surfaces of the barrel 2 to create a series of pumping pockets 35A and 35B between the outer convex edges 36 and 37 of the sealing discs 24 and the surface of the barrel 2, which pumping pockets are moved longitudinally through the pump forcing the polymer material to move towards the discharge end of the wave pump section. Because of the design of the components of the positive displacement wave pump section, high pressure at the outlet end, which would normally be acting on the full disc area and would cause very high frictional forces between the discs, is relieved, since the configuration of the outlet member 23 is such that most of the projected area of the cross section is covered by the outlet member 23 so that the pressure is transferred by the outlet member to the barrel 2. Conversely, the inlet portion 21 of the stator frame assembly 20 is designed to exert the full inlet pressure onto the discs 24 themselves thus counter acting any pressure from the outlet end. Because of the construction, the inlet portion 21 of the stator frame assembly 20 is free to undergo some movement in the appropriate direction so that the inlet pressure is free to act on the discs 24. The above described assembly of extruder screw section 1 and positive displacement wave pump section 15 provides an arrangement wherein neither the rotor nor the outer portion of the wave pump section has to be free to orbit, as would be the case in the use of a Moineau type pump arrangement, so that a flexible coupling is not required and the rotor can be rigidly attached to, and driven from the discharge end portion 1D of the extruder screw member 1. Thus the axial length of the barrel 2 for the assembly with the wve pump section 15 can be reduced relative to a comparable assembly involving a Moineau pump since one does not need to allow for the length of the flexible coupling that would have been required in the Moineau pump type arrangement.A further advantage arises from the design of the present construction since some of the polymer passes into the spaces defined between the surfaces of the oval central openings 40 of the discs 24 and the exterior surface of the circular cross section rotor 16, which effects a significant increase in pumping capacity due to the pumping action occurring between the helical surface of the rotor 16 and the bore defined by the oval central openings of the discs 24. This pumping of the polymer in the spaces defined between the rotor 16 and the discs 24 permits an increase of about 50 percent in the pumping capacity as well as achieving good lubrication of the contact points between the rotor surface and the surfaces of the disc openings 40 which see a lot of load. With this arrangement, pressure on the extruder can be reduced to very low levels so that the extruder screw is able to pump against very severe flow restrictions and yet with very low pressure at the extruder outlet the wave pump section inlet , enabling the extruder to perform at much higher rates per revolution of the screw. Thus the extruder screw head pressure is very low, the positive displacement wave pump providing the pumping force to overcome the downstream process restrictions to flow. Also, the screw thread connection at 17A and 1D between the pump section 15 and the screw section 1 facilitates removal of the rotor to change it in the extruder for a different pitch rotor to change the pumping capacity. This is important since the exact capacity of the extruder screw can be different for different polymers and blends of polymers. If the inlet pressure is too high or too low the rotor can be readily changed without removing the extruder screw. Referring now to Figures 9 to 14 of the accompany ing drawings, the second form of positive displacement wave pump assembly is largely similar to that forming part of the extruder assembly shown in Figures 1 to 8 of the drawings. The wave pump 15 includes a helical rotor 16 the cylindrical upstream end portion 16a of which is coupled in any suitable manner to a drive shaft 17 that extends upstream coaxially with the barrel 2 of the wave pump assembly. In the arrangement shown inFigs. 9 to 14, the coupling between the rotor 16 and the drive shaft 17 is not a screw coupling, and the downstream end portion 181 of the rotor is provided not with a hex formation but with an axial short cylindrical portion terminating in a tapered conical end surface. The portion of the rotor 16 between the cylindrical upstream end portion 16A and the downstream end portion 18 forms a helically contoured section 19 similar to that shown in Figures 1 to 8. A stator frame assembly 20 spans most of the axial length of the wave pump rotor 16, and includes a first frame member having an inlet portion 21 and a side frame portion 22 integrally joined together and an outlet end portion 23 collectively outwardly surrounding the rotor 16 and capturing a stack of slide discs 24 forming sealing discs. The stator frame member 20 has a cylindrical outer perimeter 20a along the two horizontally opposite lateral portions thereof over the span of the inlet portion 21, side frame portions 22 and outlet end portion 23, conforming to the inner diameter of the cylindrical confronting surface of the barrel 2 to fit tightly against the confronting surface of the housing barrel or bore and be fixed there against by any suitable means such as the screws shown in Figures 10 and 11. As is most clearly shown in Figures 13 and 14, the inlet end portion of the stator frame member 20 has a beveled or chamfered throat 25 forming a frustoconical surface coaxial with the rotor 16 converging to join a cylindrical inlet passage portion 26 which extends through a shoulder formation 27 forming the upstream bearing shoulder for the stack of slide discs 24. The opposite side frame portions 22 of the stator frame member 20 extending from the inlet portion 21 to the outlet end portion 23 have a cylindrical outer or exterior surface 20a and a flat inner surface 22b defining guide surfaces for the opposite lateral edges or flats of the slide discs 24 limiting them to rectilinear reciprocative sliding movement in a first diametric direction of the cylindrical bore 2, the vertical direction as shown in the drawings. The downstream end of the slide frame portion 22 of the stator frame member 20 provides an upstream annular shoulder face 31 confronting the slide disc 24 at the downstream end of the pack of slide discs, co active with the shoulder formation 27 of the inlet portion 21 to capture the stack of slide discs 24 therebetween. As is shown most clearly in Figures 13 and 14.The outlet member 23 has a cylindrical bore portion 49 axial with the rotor 16 which merges into an outwardly beveled or flared frustoconical surface portion 50 forming the discharge or outlet opening for the assembly.Diametrically opposite portions of this beveled surface 50 are provided with passages 51 communicating with the downstream ends of the spaces 35A and 35B above and below, respectively, the cylindrically curved arcuate upper and lower edge portions 36 and 37 of the discs 24 at vertically diametrically opposite portions of the outlet end portion 23. As will be apparent from Figs. 12A to 12C, the discs 24 are of identical configuration. Each disc 24 is bounded by two circular arcs 36 and 37 and two straight lines 38 and 39 to give a symmetrical shape. Each of the arcuate edges 36 and 37 is configured to fit exactly against the wall of the bore 2, but they are closer together than the distance between opposite sides of the bore. The straight edges 38 and 39 are so spaced that the disc 24 fits snugly between the side frame portions of the stator frame member 20. The stator frame member 20 maintains the pack of sealing discs 24 in a face to face contacting stacked array of discs each capable of freely sliding vertically relative to the others in the vertical direction, but prevented from rotating or moving in any other direction.Each of the discs 24 has a central opening 40 in the form of a laterally elongate oblong having a vertical minor axis 40a and a horizontal major axis 40b. The central opening 40 of each disc 24 is bounded by two semicircular arcs configured to fit closely the helical rotor 16 and two parallel straight lines each of which is tangential to both arcs. The dimension of the major axis 40b of the oblong opening 40 is sufficient to accommodate the maximum lateral span over the crests of the rounded helical threads of the rotor 16.The dimension of the minor axis 40a corresponds exactly to the diameter of the rotor 16 in the cylindrical portions thereof and the diameter of any circular cross section of the helical thread portion thereof, so that the discs 24 are shifted vertically up and down relative to each other to provide wave patterns resembling what is illustrated in Figures 9 and 14 providing pumping pockets 35A and 35B which progress longitudinally from the inlet end to the outler or discharge end of the wave pump section as the helically threaded rotor 16 is rotated by the drive shaft 17 By the above described construction a fluid medium being fed to the inlet end flows into the passages or spaces lying outwardly of the outer periphery of the upstream inlet portion 21 of the stator frame member 20 and thence into the spaces between the convex arcuate cylindrical edges 36 and 37 of the sealing slide discs 24 and the confronting surface of the..barrel 2, and the fluid medium also flows into the throat 25 of the inlet end portion 21 of the stator frame member 20 and passes into the spaces occurring between the central openings 40 of the discs 24 at the outer regions of the major axis 40b thereof and the exterior surface of the circular cross section rotor 16. Since the surfaces of the central openings 40 of the discs 24 contact the exterior surface of the rotor 16 all along its length along the top and bottom of the rotor, and round the side of the rotor at positions such as that shown in Figure 12C where the rotor is against one end of an opening 40, this contact creates a sealing line, preventing the fluid medium from leaking back so that it must move with the volume being displaced by the rotor shape as it rotates. Also, the convex, arcuate curved outer surfaces 36 and 37 of the discs are positioned in a pattern and progressively brought into contact with the confronting surfaces of the barrel 2 to create a series of pumping pockets 35A and 35B between the outer convex edges 24a of the sealing discs 24 and the surface of the barrel, which pumping pockets are moved longitudinally through the pump forcing the fluid medium material to move towards the discharge end of the positive displacement wave pump. Because of the design of the components of the positive displacement wave pump, high pressure at the outlet end, which would normally be acting on the full disc area and would cause very high frictional forces between the discs, is relieved, since the configuration of the outlet member 23 is such that most of the projected area of the cross section is transferred by the outlet member 23 to the barrel. Conversely, the inlet portion 21 of the stator frame assembly 20 is designed to exert the full inlet pressure onto the disks themselves thus counteracting any pressure from the outlet end. Because of the construction, the inlet portion 21 of the stator frame assembly 20 is free to undergo some movement in the appropriate direction so that the inlet pressure is free to act on the discs 24. The above described positive displacement wave pump provides an arrangement wherein neither the rotor nor the outer portion of the wave pump have to be free to orbit, as would be the case in the use of a Moineau type pump arrangement, so that no coupling is required and the rotor can be rigidly attached to the end portion of a drive shaft 17 rotating about a fixed axis. Thus because of the design of the present construction, some of the fluid medium being pumped passes into the spaces defined between the surfaces of the oval center openings 40 of the discs 24 and the exterior surface of the circular cross section rotor 16, which effects a significant increase in pumping capacity due to the pumping action occurring between the helical surface of the rotor 16 and the bore of the discs 24 defined by their oval center opening. This pumping of the fluid medium in the spaces defined between the rotor 16 and the bore of the discs 24 permits an increase of about 50 percent in the pumping capacity as well as achieving good lubrication of the contact points between the rotor surface and the surfaces of the disc openings 40 which see a lot of load.
