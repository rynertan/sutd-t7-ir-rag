# Heat pump air conditioning system.

## Abstract
A heat pump air conditioning system with an active digital control of the refrigeration cycle thereof to improve the coefficient of performance. The system can incorporate solar collectors 30 in parallel with the outdoor heat exchanger 32 and a water storage tank 38 in the system to most utilize solar heating and nocturnal cooling as additional heat source or heat sink means when these means are available to further improve the coefficient of performance. The system also incorporates individual temperature control means 96, 98 in each room to circulate an adequate amount of water from the storage tank 38 in accordance with the heat demand of each room, thus contributing to realization of an energy efficient central air conditioning system.
