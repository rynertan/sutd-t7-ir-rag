# Gas discharge display device.

## Abstract
In a gas discharge display device, a plurality of parallel cathodes 40 connected to cathode terminals K ₁ to K ₄ by multiphase connection 41 are disposed in equally spaced apart relation on one surface of a substrate 10 , while a plurality of parallel and equally spaced apart anodes 70 are disposed on the rear surface of a face plate 60 in a relation crossing with the cathodes, and the fact plate is superposed on the subsrate through barrier ribs 50 defining a discharge space 110 . In the display device, time serial multiphase pulse voltage trains are applied to the individual cathodes respectively, while a train of pulses of large width corres ponding to display information is applied to each of the anodes in a relation superposed on a train of pulses of small width used for initiation of an auxiliary discharge.
