# Fluorescent corrosive fluoride solution.

## Abstract
A composition of matter including an aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid or ammonium fluoride and a dye that fluoresces when illuminated by ultra violet light. Spilled corrosive fluoride solutions are thereby rendered easily detectable by subjecting the surface onto which the solution was spilled to ultra violet radiation.
