A secured housing 10 for an electronic device 11 having an electronic memory 24 has an access aperture 20 which provides tamper proof security and electro magnetic interference protection while permitting access to the mem ory for reading. Opening of the access aperture 20 disables the device from further operation by operating a switch 56 which disconnects the device from its power supply while preventing reengagement of the switch to reactivate the electronic device. Use of the access aperture 20 preferably provides a visible indication of access to the interior of the housing. The electronic device may be an electronic postage meter and the electronic memory a nonvolatile memory containing postage accounting information.
