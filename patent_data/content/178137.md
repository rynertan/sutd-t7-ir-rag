## Abstract
The 16 kbit s HDLC formatted signaling channel 5 for each of 256 ISDN subscribers is separated from the data chan nel D at the exchange line circuit CCT and TDM multiplexed into a 4 Mbit s stream provided to a common signaling handler SH . In the handler, a receiving element 10 processes each new bit of the 4 Mbit s stream with 47 bits read out of a channel parameter store 30 by a channel number provided by a chan nel allocation store 20 . The 47 bits include the previous 7 received bits and a message byte address for that channel. When those 7 bits and the new bit form a new deformatted msessage byte, that byte is written into an incoming message store 40 at a location determined by the current channel num ber and message byte address. Using a FIFO buffer 50 , mes sages are read from the incoming message store 40 by a processor 60 in the order in which they are completed.
