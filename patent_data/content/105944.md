## Description
LIQUID PHASE PREPARATION OF 2 SUBSTITUTED 2 OXAZOLINES WITH ORGANIC ZINC SALT CATALYSTS 2 Substituted 2 oxazolines form a known class of compounds having many members and many utilities. The chemistry of such oxazolines has been summarized, for example, by Wiley et al., Chemical Reviews, Vol. 44, 447 1949 , bySeeliger et al., Angew. Chem. International Edition, Vdl. 5,No. 10, 875 1966 , and by Frump, Chemical Reviews, Vol. 71,No. 5, 483 1971 . One of the prior art processes for preparing 2 substituted 2 oxazolines is the cyclodehydration of N t hydroxyalkyl carboxamides. This cyclodehydration occurs in vapor phase over alumina U.S. Patent 3,562,263 and Frump, as mentioned above, page 485 and in liquid phase over certain salts of manganese, cobalt, rare earth metals, molybdenum and tungsten U.S. Patents 3,681,329 and 3,681,333 . The latter two patents indicate that the cyclodehydration reaction is brought about by heating the hydroxyamide and catalyst together in a distillation apparatus from which the oxazoline product distills from the reaction mixture as it is formed along with the by product water. In another process, 2 substituted 2 oxazolines are prepared by heating N 2 hydroxyalkyl carboxamides in the presence of certain inorganic iron salts EuropeanPatent Publication 0033752, published August 19, 1981,The Dow Chemical Company . However, this process does not result in as high yields as does the invention described in this application. The present invention is a cyclodehydration process for making a 2 substituted 2 oxazoline characterized by reacting in the liquid phase an N 2 hydroxyalkyl carboxamide having the formulaEMI2.1 where R is alkyl of 1 to 17 carbon atoms, Optionally substituted phenyl, aralkyl of 7 to 17 carbon atoms, alkenyl of 2 to 17 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of 3 to 17 carbon atoms or a carboxylic acid amine salt pr..urser of iai carboxamide. The temperature pressure relationship is normally adjusted such that the oxazoline and water codistill from the reaction mixture essentially as fast as they are formed. The N hydroxyalkyl carboxamides used in the instant process have the formulaEMI2.2 wherein R is alkyl of 1 tof7 carbon atoms, or phenyl, or a carboxylic acid amine salt precursor of said carboxamide Such carboxamides are typically prepared by reacting a carboxylic acid or a lower alkyl ester of the carboxylic acid with an ethanol amine of the formula II. NH2 CH2 CH2 OH The carboxylic acid amine salt which is formed initially in these reactions can be used in the instant process in place of the carboxamide. When such carboxylic acid amine salts are used, the carboxamide is generated in situ. R in formulaI is preferably methyl, ethyl or phenyl and more preferably methyl or ethyl.Examples of suitable N l hydroxyalkyl carboxamides include compounds of formula I having the following values for R CH3, C2H5, C3H7, C7H15, C99, C11H23 C17H35 C6H5, C6H4CH3, C6H5CH2, CH3 CH2 7CH CH CH2 7 and cyclohexyl. The catalysts in the instant cyclodehydration reaction are organic zinc salts which are soluble in the carboxamide reactant or liquid reaction medium. The term soluble is not meant to imply that the zinc salt is soluble or miscible in all proportions with the carboxamide or liquid reaction medium, but instead has at least a minimum solubility e.g., at least about 100 parts per million or more at reaction temperature. Such zinc salts are used in the process in catalytic amounts. Normally, the zinc salts are charged in amounts of from 0.005 to 0.4 mole of zinc salt per mole of carboxamide reactant, but more or less of the zinc salts can be used, if desired.Carboxylic acid salts of zinc having the formula RCOO 2Zn wherein R is a C1 C20 aliphatic or alicyclic radical or an inertly substituted C1 C20 aliphatic or alicyclic carboxylic acid radical may be used as catalysts in the invention. Suitable carboxylic acid zinc salts include, for example, zinc acetate, zinc formate, zinc propionate, zinc stearate and zinc neodecanoate. Zinc acetate is the current preferred catalyst. The instant cyclodehydration reaction may be conducted neat or in solution with a suitable inert solvent.By inert is meant inert in the process. Suitable such inert solvents include, for example, chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, aromatic hydrocarbons, cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is preferred however, to conduct the reaction neat. The reaction temperature must, obviously, be sufficient to promote the cyclodehydration reaction and is nor mally selected in the range of from about 1400C to about 2800C. Preferred reaction rates have been observed at temperatures of from about 1600C to about 2500C. The instant cyclodehydration reaction is also preferably conducted under reduced pressure. This facilitates product recovery in that frequently a reaction temperature may be chosen which is above the boiling point of the 2 substituted 2 oxazoline product and below the boiling point of the N a hydroxy alkyl carboxamide. In this manner, the 2 substituted 2 oxazoline can be removed from the reaction mixture as a volatile gas essentially as fast as it is formed.This is very desirable since the instant cyclodehydration reaction is a reversible process and by removing the products, the reaction is forced to completion by substantially reducing the reverse reaction Water normally codistills with the 2 substituted 2 oxazoline product. The instant process may be conducted in a batch process or by a continuous process. In the preferred continuous proess tkse Nb hydroxyalkyl carboxamide reactant is metered into the reaction vessel at essentially the same rate as the 2 substituted 2 oxazoline and water are removed. The following examples further illustrate the invention.Example 1 Preparation of 2Ethyl 2 Oxazoline Over Zinc Acetate Dihydrate Zinc acetate dihydrate 10.0 g 0.045 mole and 95.4 percent pure N g hydroxyethyl propionamide 20.0 g 0.162 mole were charged to a reaction vessel equipped with a stirring means, a metering pump, and a 5 plate distillation column with a take off head. The pressure over the reaction mixture was adjusted to 50 mm Hg and the reaction mixture heated to 2000C. The reaction mixture was held at 2000C and 95.4 percent pure N t hydroxyethyl propionamide 290 g 2.35 mole was pumped in at approximately 0.9 g min to the system. As the propionamide was added to the reaction mixture, a water white distillate was collected overhead through the distillation apparatus at a head temperature of 400C 450c. After the addition of the propionamide was complete, the pot was heated to 2200C to drive off the last amounts of 2 ethyl 2 oxazoline. The overhead distillate temperature reached a maximum of 410C during this post heating step. A total of 294.8 g of water white distillate was thus obtained overhead leaving 21. 7 g of a tan, wet paste remaining in the pot. Analysis of the distillate overheads by gas chromatography using an internal standard and a Karl Fischer water titration showed the material to be 2 e thYl oxazoline, water and very minor amounts of unreacted propionamide and 2 methyl 2 oxazoline.The impurities in the propionamide reactant were water approximately 1 percent monoethanolamine approximately 2 3 percent and the amidoester of propionic acid and monoethanolamine approximately 1 percent . The oxazoline was produced in 96.2 percent yield, based on the pure N hydroxyethyl propionamide charged to the system. The amount of water produced according to analysis was 93.0 percent of theory. The 2 ethyl 2 oxazoline can be easily separated from the mixture by selective extraction using diethylbenzene followed by distillation. Example 2 In another experiment, 2 ethyl .2 oxazoline was prepared in 82 percent yield by warming a propionic acid ethanolamine salt in the presence of approximately 2 mole percent zinc acetate dihydrate at a temperature of 2000C 50 mm Hg. This was a batch experiment in which the acid amine salt and catalyst were initially charged and warmed to the indicated reaction temperature. There was a pause in the rise in temperature during which the acid amine salt was converted to the amide. Otherwise, this reaction proceeded the same as Example 1 above. The product was similarly recovered as an overhead distillate with water. Other catalysts and carboxamide reactants as set forth above could be similarly used to produce the 2 substituted 2 oxazolines.
