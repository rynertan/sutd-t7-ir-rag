# Method of manufacturing a welded can body.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a welded can body from tinplate 6 or a tin iron alloy plated steel sheet 6 comprises overlapping the opposite marginal portions 6d, 6 d of a blank of the tinplate 6 or the tiniron plated steel 6 sheet to form a can body preform having an overlapping portion, applying at least to the cut edges 8 of the marginal portions 7 of the blank a fluxing agent 11 promoting wetting of steel with molten tin, and electrical resistance seam welding the overlapping portion in a nonoxidizing atmosphere by employ ing a pair of wire electrodes 3a, 3b each covered by a layer of metallic tin 18 on the surface thereof facing the overlapping portion. The welded portion has improved corrosion resis tance, as an extruded weld portion and a remaining cut edge surface portion thereof are covered with tin transferred from the surfaces of the wire electrodes and or the tinplate 6 during the welding operation.
