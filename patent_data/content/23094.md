# Diaphragm for cladding a cathode box of an electrolytic cell, sheet for forming into a diaphragm, and a method of cladding a cathode box.

## Abstract
A diaphragm or membrane suitable for cladding a cathode box 1 for use in an electrolytic cell and comprising a plurality of foraminate cathodes of the pocket type, the diaphragm or membrane comprising a sleeve portion 33 and a plurality of tabs 23, 24, 26, 27 on both edges of the sleeve portion 33 , and preferably two tabs on both edges of the sleeve portion, the dimensions of the sleeve portion 33 being such that, when the diaphragm is positioned in a pocket of the cathode box 1 , the edges of the sleeve portion and the tabs thereon project beyond the extremities of the pocket so that they may be joined to the tabs and sleeve portions 33 of diaphragms or membranes in adjacent pockets of the cathode box.
