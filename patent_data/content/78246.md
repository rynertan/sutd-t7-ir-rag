# ROTARY HEAD NUMBERING MACHINE TO MARK LENGTHS ON FABRICS

## Abstract
The description is of a rotary head numbering machine to mark lengths on fabrics. It is suitable to effect the aforesaid marking directly on the side edge or selvage of the fabric, particularly for long pieces of fabric. The numbering head, in accordance with the invention, is able to overcome the problems of traditional machines which, by not permitting the printing of the length on the fabric, required the application of labels to indicate the length which involve long and expensive operations and due to their thickness, cause a deformation of the piece which resulted in an impression on the fabric. The numbering head T subject of this invention permits the length to be printed directly on the fabric 2 and for this purpose is equipped with at least three printing discs 10A, 10B, 10C for the units, tens and hundreds respectively, capable of being positioned, by suitable control means 55,14 in the printing position synchronously with the rate of advancement of the fabric 2 .
