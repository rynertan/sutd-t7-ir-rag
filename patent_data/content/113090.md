# Hot dipping.

## Abstract
A method for forming a metal coating on an elongated member, specifically, for forming a thick metal coating on a wire or the like, in which an elongated member being drawn through a melt is extracted from the surface of the bath in a gas container. The gas container is supplied with a nonox idizing gas, liquid or a mixture. Preferably, the gas, liquid or mixture is supplied at a temperature sufficiently low to prevent oxidation of the surface of the melt and to cool the elongated member rapidly. The bath should contain a structure for causing the gas, liquid or mixture supply thereto to swirl around the elongated member.
