## Description
ARTICLES MADE FROM POLYMER COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to articles made from polymer compositions, more specifically dimensionally heat recoverable especially heat shrinkable articles. More especially, but not exclusively, it is directed to heat shrinkable sleeving and heat shrinkable moulded products for use in electrical apparatus in which after shrinking they will be subjected to an electrical 4 stress along their surfaces of at least 10 V m. The use of polymer based materials for such heat shrink products, especially out of doors, is severely inhibited by the liability of many such materials to failure by tracking the formation of conductive paths by carbonisation of the organic constituent s of the material , rapid erosion, or flame the most popular flexible materials currently commercially available are expensive materials based on the use of alumina trihydrate filler either in very large amounts or in combination with iron iii oxide which presumably catalyses some reaction that competes with carbonisation . Large amounts of filler limit physical properties that can be achieved, whereas iron III oxide imparts an undesirable intrinsic colour, which makes colour coding of the kind conventional in the electrical industry difficult or impossible. In accordance with the present invention, a dimensionally heat recoverable article is made from a polymer composition comprising i a polymeric base comprising at least one polymer having a main chain comprising carbon atoms and optionally oxygen and or nitrogen atoms but no other hetero atoms crosslinked to a condition in which it is dimensionally heat recoverable and has a recovery temperature not less than 80 C and, per hundred parts of the base by weight ii 40 to 120 parts of mineral filler of which a at least half, subject to a minimum of 30 parts, is calcium carbonate with a number average particle size in the range 0.01 to 50 micrometre and containing substantially no particles with a dimension in excess of 100 micrometre b up to 20 parts may be an inert mineral filler, and c the balance, if any, is an active flame retardant filler and optionally effective amounts of iii a one or more pigment b one or more antioxidant and or ultra violet stabiliser c one or more acid acceptor and d one or more processing aid. Surprisingly such polymer compositions can achieve a tracking resistance, as determined by the method of ASTM specification D 2303, in excess of 3.0 kV. The polymer base may be of any polymer or polymer mixture free of main chain hetero atoms other than oxygen and or nitrogen that is capable of having the dimensional heat recoverable properties defined, sufficiently inert and capable of accepting the specified loading of calcium carbonate. Among polymers that have been recommended for dimensionally heat recoverable products that are believed suitable are a polyethylene and semi crystalline or elastomeric copolymers of ethylene with other hydrocarbons, such as with propene, butene, or propene and a diene b semi crystalline or amorphous copolymers of ethylene with one or more unsaturated ester or acid, especially with the lower acrylates methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate or with vinyl acetate but including also copolymers with methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, esters of maleic, itaconic or fumaric acid, or vinyl propionate c ionomeric resins, such as are obtained by partial neutralisation of carboxylic acid copolymers included in Group b d polyethylene oxide e natural rubber, butyl rubber, synthetic polyisoprenes, nitrile rubbers f crosslinkable polyesters such as dodecamethylene polypyromellitimide and the Hytrel trade mark series of elastomeric polyesters g alkene alkadiene block copolymers, especially styrene butadiene styrene and styrene isoprene styrene block copolymers h polyvinylidene difluoride chlorinated polyethylene and j homopolymers of butyl acrylate and its copolymers with ethyl acrylate or glycidyl methacrylate. Except when the base polymer is capable of being and has been crosslinked by radiation, residues of a chemical crosslinking agent will normally be present, and crosslinking promoters or their residues may be present in all cases. Preferred are hydrocarbon chain polymers with side chain hetero atoms to enhance compatibility and loading capacity, and the most preferred side chains are esters and other carboxylic groups. Typical preferred polymers are the semi crystalline copolymers of ethylene with vinyl acetate, ethyl acrylate, methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate or acrylic acid. Commercially available filler grades of calcium carbonate, which generally have a mean particle size in the range 0.01 50 micrometre, can be used, and comparable results are obtained with natural and synthetic precipitated types however, particle sizes in the range 0.01 10 micrometre are preferred. The calcium carbonate particles may be coated with a dispersing agent, such as calcium stearate or with a coupling agent, such as a silane or titanate, or an organic material polymerised in situ on the particles Suitable active flame retardant fillers include the usual filler grades of alumina trihydrate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, and dolomite. Suitable inert non flame retardant mineral fillers include silica flour, clay and talc. Radiation crosslinking is preferred in all cases chemical crosslinking may be feasible in some cases. For most of the polymers listed, the organic peroxides readily available and widely used for the purpose are the most appropriate crosslinking agents Sioplas crosslinking though the grafting of hydrolysable silane side chains to the polymer base is possible for some polymer bases, but is likely to be difficult because calcium carbonate is somewhat hygroscopic and at high loadings may carry enough water to risk premature crosslinking. Preferred crosslinking promoters, for use in radiation crosslinking or in conjunction with peroxides, are the polyfunctional unsaturated esters, such as trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl trimellitate and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate. Most conventional antioxidants, ultra violet stabilisers, acid acceptors, processing aids and other conventional additives can be used. One suitable acid acceptor is magnesium oxide. Some pigments can also be used but we have found that they need to be chosen with care and in particular that titanium dioxide degrades resistance to tracking and that its use, alone or in admixture with coloured pigments, is not to be recommended. The dimensionally heat recoverable articles in accordance with the invention may be made wholly of the polymer composition defined, or that composition may form a coating or other surface layer on a body made of conventional dimensionally heat recoverable material. The compositons are in most cases suitable for extrusion and or injection moulding prior to cross linking and deformation to the heat recoverable condition. Examples 1 16 The formulations of Examples 1 11 set out in the following Table were prepared, extruded into tubing of 25 mm internal diameter and 3.5 mm wall thickness, and crosslinked by electron beam irradiation at 200 KGy 20Mrad t They were then expanded 1508 by pre heating to 1400C and blowing into a cold cylindrical mould to impart dimensional heat recovery properties. Comparison Examples 12 16 were similarly processed so far as possible the composition of Example 13 had physical properties so poor that it would not be extruded. Flat compression moulded specimens of the same composition were similarly irradiated and tested for tracking performance according to ASTM D 2303 with the results indicated TABLE EMI7.1 Example SEP No SEP 1 SEP 2 SEP 3 SEP 4 SEP 5 SEP 6 SEP 7 SEP 8 tb Composition SEP parts SEP by SEP weight tb Ethylene vinyl SEP acetate tb copolymer SEP 28 SEP vinyl SEP acetate SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP Evatane SEP 28 05 tb Ethylene ethyl SEP acrylate tb copolymer SEP 15 SEP ethyl SEP acrylate , SEP SEP SEP SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 100 tb SEP DPDM SEP 6182 tb SEP Silicone SEP Rubber SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP Calcium SEP Carbonate tb SEP Snowcal SEP 7ML SEP SEP 80 SEP 100 SEP 60 SEP SEP 80 SEP SEP 100 tb SEP Winnofil SEP 8 SEP 80 SEP SEP SEP SEP 60 SEP SEP 80 SEP Alumina SEP Trihydrate SEP Hydral SEP 710 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP Dolomite SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP China SEP Clay SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP Antioxidant tb SEP Flectol SEP Pastiles SEP SEP SEP SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 tb SEP Irganox SEP 0.2 SEP 0.2 SEP 0.2 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP Lead SEP Phthalate SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP Stearic SEP Acid SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP tb Properties tb Erosion SEP inception SEP voltage SEP kV SEP 3.5 SEP SEP 3.25 SEP 3.25 SEP 3.0 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.25 SEP 3.5 tb SEP mean SEP of SEP 2 SEP or SEP 3 SEP measurements tb Failure SEP voltage SEP kV SEP 4.0 SEP SEP 4.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 6.25 SEP 5.5 SEP 6.0 SEP 4.0 tb Failure SEP mode SEP f SEP f SEP f SEP f SEP f tb TABLE Continued EMI8.1 Example SEP No SEP 9 SEP 10 SEP 11 SEP 12 SEP 13 SEP 14 SEP 15 SEP 16 tb Composition SEP parts SEP by SEP weight tb Ethylene vinyl SEP acetate tb copolymer SEP 28 SEP vinyl SEP acetate SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP Evatane SEP 28 05 tb Ethylene ethyl SEP acrylate tb copolymer SEP 15 SEP ethyl SEP acrylate , SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP 100 SEP SEP DPDM SEP 6182 tb SEP Silicone SEP Rubber SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP 100 tb Calcium SEP Carbonate tb SEP Snowcal SEP 7ML SEP 120 SEP 35 SEP 80 SEP 30 SEP 150 SEP 35 SEP 80 SEP 80 tb SEP Winnofil SEP 8 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP Alumina SEP Trihydrate SEP Hydral SEP 710 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP 45 SEP SEP Dolomite SEP SEP 45 SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP China SEP Clay SEP SEP SEP 10 SEP SEP SEP SEP 30 SEP Antioxidant tb SEP Flectol SEP Pastiles SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 SEP 0.5 SEP SEP Irganox SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP SEP Lead SEP Phthalate SEP SEP SEP 2 SEP SEP SEP SEP 2 SEP Stearic SEP Acid SEP 2.0 SEP 1.5 SEP 1.5 SEP 1.0 SEP 1.0 SEP 1.0 SEP 2.0 SEP 1.5 tb Properties tb Erosion SEP inception SEP voltage SEP kV SEP 3.25 SEP 3.5 SEP 3.0 SEP 2.75 SEP 3.25 SEP 2.6 SEP 2.9 SEP 2.3 tb SEP mean SEP of SEP 2 SEP or SEP 3 SEP measurements tb Failure SEP voltage SEP kV SEP 4.0 SEP 3.25 SEP 3.0 SEP 2.3 tb Failure SEP mode SEP t SEP f SEP f SEP t tb for compound The calcium carbonates used in the examples are as follows Snowcal 7ML is a superfine whiting grade of natural calcium carbonate with a mean particle size of 2.9 micrometre and a particle distribution by sieving as follows finer than 25 micrometres practically 100 finer than 20 micrometres 99 finer than 10 micrometres 95 finer than 5 micrometres 75 finer than 3 micrometres 53 Winnofil S is a precipitated calcium carbonate with a nominal particle size of 75 nm, surface coated with calcium stearate to inhibit agglomeration and promote dispersion. In the Table, t denotes ultimate breakdown by tracking and f ultimate breakdown by flaming in other cases the mode of ultimate breakdown has not yet been determined. Example 17 This was similar to the preceding examples except that the polymer composition used was that sold in the United Kingdom by BXL Plastics Limited under the designation BP D 2979 FR. This was found by analysis to consist essentially of an ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer 100 parts , natural calcium carbonate 80 parts and polymerised trihydroxyquinoline small amount . Observation with the scanning electron microscope suggested that the sizes of the particles of calcium carbonate were typically in the range 0.5 2 micrometre.The erosion inception voltage was found to be 3.5 kV and ultimate breakdown occurred by flaming at 6.25 kV. All the compositions used in the examples are based on extrusion grade polymers and are useful for heatshrink tubing applications when crosslinked by irradiation. Similar formulations based on injection moulding grades of polymer would be preferred for injection moulded dimensionally heat recoverable articles such as crutch covers, break outs and shedded sleeves for high voltage cable terminations.
