# Heating apparatus having a heat storage device.

## Abstract
Heating apparatuses such as irons, hot plates, pans, etc., in which a heat storage device is added with use of heat storage substances are equipped with heat storage elements which avail themselves of the large amount of latent heat for their crystal transition, whereby cordless operation and improvement in heating characteristics may be designed and further, thermal stability of pentaerythritol is enhanced, thereby enabling their long period use.
