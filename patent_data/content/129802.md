# Process for continuous hydroformylation of allyl alcohol.

## Abstract
Ally alcohol is hydroformylated with a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, in an aromatic hydrocar bon, in the presence of a rhodium complex and a trisubsti tuted phosphine, to form hydroxybutyraldehydes which are separated from the reaction mixture within an aqueous medium. The carbon monoxide partial pressure, the rate of consumption of carbon monoxide, the rate at which the car bon monoxide is dissolved in the reaction mixture, reaction temperature and the viscosity of the reaction mixture are selected and controlled in an interrelated way to give a high yield of 4 hydroxybutyraldehyde and reduced catalyst com sumption.
