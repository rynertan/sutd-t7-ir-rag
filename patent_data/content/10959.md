# Phase lock loop.

## Abstract
A phase lock loop 11 is supplied with a pre conditioned pulse stream derived in a preconditioning circuit 10 from coded data pulse sequences not having transitions in every data cell. The data pulses are applied to bi stable devices 14, 23 of the preconditioning circuit 10 , to produce a delay of one and three halves of a data cell period. The delayed data pulses, one of which also inverted, are applied to an exclusive OR gate 28 whose output connects to a further bistable device 29 . The bistable device 29 provides a signal, having pulse transitions when the output of the exclusive OR gate is high, to a second exclusive OR gate 31 which also receives data delayed by one data cell period and which provides the preconditioned pulse stream at its output. An additional exclusive OR gate 33 connected to the outputs of the bistable devices 14, 23 enables an NRZ coded signal to be derived from NRZI coded data pulses.
