# Multiple use neck tie structure.

## Abstract
A multiple use neck ties structure comprises a body 1 provided with an elongate conformation, constituted by a first end section 2 and a second end section 3 , both tapering towards a narrow central connector section 4 , in which the first and the second end sections 2, 3 have characteristics of colour and pattern different from one another, and may be either the same width or may have a width different from one another. In this way, when a knot 5 is tied, the section 2 of greater width or the section 3 of smaller width is visible, the latter being outlined by the underlying section 2 of greater width. The intermediate connector section 4 can be made from the corner portions of a piece of fabric from which the said end sections 2 and 3 are made by cutting diagonally of the fabric sheet.

## Description
Multiple Use Neck Tie StructureThe present invention relates to a multiple use neck tie structure. As is known, to make a neck tie, the current process is to cut out the constituent elements of the neck tie from a sheet of fabric cut on the bias i.e. diagonally of the weft and warp of the fabric in such a way as to obtain two end sections and a central narrow connector section which when joined together form a neck tie.Currently, each neck tie is made from a single piece of fabric in such a way that the two end sections and the central connector section all have the same characteris tic colour and design. A neck tie made in this manner is of fixed appearance and there is no way in which the aesthetic appearance of the neck tie can be modified.Moreover, generally, neck ties are made with end sections having dimensions which are different from one another in such a way that the wider section overlies a narrower section when the neck tie is put on.In particular, the end section which appears uppermost or outermost, when the knot is made, has a greater width than the other end section, which lies beneath the first mentioned wider section. The present invention seeks to provide a neck tie the appearance of which can be varied by the user in dependence on the manner in which and the position along the tie at which the knot is tied.It is a particular advantage of the invention that it provides a multiple use neck tie structure which can be obtained by utilising a process which is substantially the same as the traditional technique, but which by the rationalisation of all the production phases allows a particularly original and versatile product to be obtained. The neck tie structure of the present invention is particularly acceptable to users in that it allows them to be able to obtain various colour combinations with a single neck tie. The neck tie structure of the invention can be made using normal materials which are commercially available and, does not involve a greater production cost.According to the present invention a multiple use neck tie structure comprises a body having an elongate conformation constituted by a first end section and a second end section both tapering towards a central narrow connector section, characterised by the fact that each of the said first and second end sections has a colour and or pattern which is different from that of the other.Various embodiments of the present invention will now be more particularly described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a plan schematically representing a fabric from which, by cutting diagonally, the end sections are formed Figure 2 schematically illustrates an end section of a neck tie in which the fold lines are illustrated Figure 3 illustrates a neck tie which can be obtained using the principles of the present invention Figure 4 is a view of the neck tie of the invention with the wider end section overlying the narrower end section Figure 5 is a view of the same neck tie with the narrower end section overlying the wider end section and Figure 6 is a view of a neck tie provided with two end sections of the same width, which can be superimposed over one another.Referring now to the drawings, the multiple use neck tie structure according to the invention comprises a body having an elongate conformation, which is generally indicated with the reference numeral 1.The body 1 is constituted, as is normal, by a first end section 2 and by a second end section 3 which are slightly tapered towards an intermediate connector section indicated 4. Moreover, as is usual, there are provided internal linings and a possible reinforcement core, which are not shown in the drawings.The particularity of the present invention is constituted by the fact that the first end section 2 and the second end section 3 are both made with fabrics which have a different colour, pattern, design or ornament from the other.In the embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 2 the first and second end sections are formed in such a way as to have the same width as one another but have a different colour and or pattern. Advantageously the colours chosen for the two end sections 2 and 3 are consonant such that they can be put adjacent one another in a manner to obtain a pleasing aesthetic effect.With this embodiment of neck tie, by tying the knot in different ways, the wearer has the possibility of obtaining aesthetic effects which are otherwise only obtainable by wearing different neck ties. In fact, by tying the knot 5 one way the end section 2 may be in view showing one colour, and by tying the knot 5 in a different way the other of the end sections 3 is in view, that is uppermost. It is therefore possible to tie the knot 5 in such a way as to give the impression of having two neck ties available which, apparently, are different from one another.In the embodiment of Figure 3 the neck tie is made with one end section 2 having a greater width than the other end section 3. The wearer thus has the possibility of tying the knot 5 in a first way, in which the section 2 of greater width isinviewJ that is uppermost, or, alternatively, the knot 5 may be tied in such a way as to make the end section 3 of smaller width appear uppermost or outermost. In this case the outermost end section 3 is seen surrounded, along its edges, by the section 2 of greater width which is underlying it, thus obtaining a nes aesthetis effect whilst still utilising only a single neck tie.With the described construction there is the possibility of making better use of the fabric from which the end sections 2 and 3 are diagonally cut in that the connection sections 4 can be formed by cutting them out from the corner zones, which otherwise would constitute a waste part in the production of the neck tie. Moreover, there is the possibility of tying the knot 5 in such a way that the junction zone between the central section 4 and one or the other of the end sections 2 and 3 is visible. At this junction a change of colour and or pattern occurs this is shown in Figures 4 and 6 in which a different aesthetic appearance from, for example,the tie knotted as inFigure 5 is obtained with the same tie, simply by tying the knot in a different place along the length of the knot.In fact, the user can exploit variously the combinations of chromatic and pattern characteristics by varying the positioning of the junction zone 4 with respect to the knot 5 being tied.
