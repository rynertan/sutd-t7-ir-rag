# A stabilized water in mineral oil emulsion and a process for the preparation of said emulsion.

## Abstract
A stabilized water in mineral oil emulsion containing a finely divided stabilizer which is substantially undissolved in the constituent phases of the emulsion and forms an interface between said phases. The emulsion is produced starting from water, mineral oil, a surfactant and a stabilizer, which is preferably formed in situ. The emulsion can be used as fuel and displays an improved combustion.
