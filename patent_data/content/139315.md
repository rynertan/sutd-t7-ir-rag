# Apparatus for reading a disk shaped optical record carrier.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for reading an optical record carrier. During a search mode an optical read unit is rapidly moved in a radial direction. By means of a control circuit a servo control loop is rendered operative and inoperative in accordance with a predetermined periodic pattern. By means of a deflection element in the optical read unit said servo control loop controls the scanning position of the read spot on the record carrier. During a fast search operation the control circuit defines the operative period of the servo control loop in such a way that the address signals recorded in the vertical fly back periods of the video signal are read with a high reliability.
