Device according to claim ss characterized by the presence of curved ends 2 corresponding to an 0 approximately 90 angle solidly connected to a rectilinear rod. 5. Device according to claim 1 characterized by the presence.of the device for attaching the curved ends 2,tb the walls equipped with transverse bar 10, for the insertion of a hook 11 in the cavity 8. 6. Device acoording to claim j characterized by the presence of the rod 14 equipped with groove 15 for insertion of the profile 13 of onen rings 32 so that th. latter and so the curtains 4 may be moved beyond the brackets 16. 7. Device according to claims j and 6 characterized by the presence of curved end 2 apDlied backwards in central position C between two rods X put in place on windows in walls at an angle, so as to realize a single and continuous guide, suitable for sliding of the curtains 4, gathering them in any suitable positions 8. Device according to claim I characterized by the fact that the curtains 4 are moved by tugging.

## Description
Device for sliding and lateral gathering of curtains on rings, put together bv means of curved bends on the endsThe invention concerns a device put together from a rectangular support rod and curved ends so as to allow sliding and complete lateral gathering of curtains held on rings.It is well known that rods and rings form a particular type of structure for supporting interior window curtains or the like which is frequently used with modern furnishings, instead of the more tradsational pelmet type or the like.Said ring rods are nsuallv siintlv made of a cvlindrical structure in which several circular, or other shape, rings are inserted to support the curtains.Said rods are put into place with suitable brackets or end supports, which form a barrier to the lateral gathering of said rings, which obviously cannot go beyond them, and so also of the curtains hanging from them, which whenever they are moved to the side to allow maximum light entrance from the window, are all gathered together at the ends. Th s placement obviously reduces the surface area useful for passage of light and, very often takes up a large amount of the living space, since the curtains remath gathered several centimeters from the walls as a function of the length of the brackets, especially in the case where containers for the rolling shutters are present protruding into the interior spaceThe aim of this inventinn is to realize a device to allow the lateral gathering of curtains on rings with minimum bulk and maximum opening for the entrance of light.This aim is achieved with a device realized with assemblable elements consisting of a support rod of any shape, adjustable in length, and curved ends corresponding to an approximately 900 angle, to be applied to the ends of said rod so as to form a continuous guide which can be followed all the way by the rings supporting the curtains, which can in this way slide and be gathered into a position adjacent to the wall where it is appliedSome variants and applications of the invention are shown in an exemplifying way in the attached figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, which show figure 1, the axonometric view of the device put nin place on an interior window figure 2, the view of the device with the curtains gathered on the sides figures 3 and 4, two variants of the elements of adjustable length figure 5, the axonometric view of the device adr attachment to the wall figure 6, the schematization from the top of a multiple variant for the installation of curtains on rings on two windows1 in a corner figure 7, the open ring variant and its support, suitable for placement of the elements shout in figure 6.With reference to the details, the figures show that the device according to the invention consists of a central rectilinear rod 4, connected with no break in continuity with lateral curvedtube ends 2, to support the rings 3 to which the curtains 4 are attached, so that they may be gathered, by sliding said rings on said rod and said ends until they reach the side walls P, as in figure 2, according to the aim of the invention.With regard to the elements being assembled and the adoption of standard, sized rods 3 to windows of slightly varying widths, the solution in figure 3 provides for the presence of threading 5 on the ends of the structure of rod 1, for a depth greater than the length of pin 6,made of plastic and connected to the curved end 2, so that the length of the rod 1 itself may be adjusted, by means of eventual cutsL, L2 made in correspondence with said threading 5, always however leaving a depth sufficient for complete penetration of said pin 6, so as to form a whole guide the same length as the window to which it is applied.However, the same aim may be achieved with the telescopic elements and 2 shown in figure 4.Furthermore, futther adjustment of the width tf the application is possible if said ends ss are fixed to the wall, according to the invention, by means of devices 7 comprising coaxial cavities 8 and 9 with transverse bar 10 suitable for attaching to eventual hooks Ii, inserted in the wall P, thus causing stall lateral displacements corresponding to the diameter of the deepest cavity 8.A striking characteristic of the finding consists of the fact that a curved end structure 2 may be applied backwards between two rods 1 placed in front of two windows F on corner walls, as shown in fixture 6, so that the curtains 4 may be gathered as desired either in central position C, hiding the corner, or on one or both sides of the complex. The above of course is possible only when the rings can slide along the guide realized as a whole, without encountering any obstacles in the form of supports or brackets of the traditional type.To satisfy this reouirement, the invention provides for the presence of rings 22, with an open rather than closed structure, with the profile 13 senGtrating the groove 15 of rod 14, supported b bracket 16 which does not impeded passage of the rings 12 as they slide. Rings 3 and 12 may be operated by dragging cords of known type, or by pulling.In another application variant, the device according to the invention may be used for the realization of support structures, attached to walls, for towels and the like.Of course, while the principle of the finding remains the same, the forms of realization and the details of construction may be varied widely from that described and illustrated here, without going beyond the bounds of the present invention.
