# Improved method for forming compacted bodies of glassmaking raw materials.

## Abstract
Forming discrete bodies such as briquettes of glass forming raw materials is often advantageous in melting such materials to form said glasses. Such discrete bodies are formed by combining the particulate raw materials with a liquid binder and compressing the combination. This pro cess is improved by using a dilute silicate solution as the liquid binder and by adding the maximum amount of the silicate solution to the raw materials that still provides a free flowing dry appearing material. This amount of silicate solution results in a maximum crush strength when the discrete bodies are prepared.
