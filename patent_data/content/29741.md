# A METHOD OF FORMING A VALVE BODY SECTION WITH INTEGRAL HUB AND VALVE BODY MADE USING SUCH METHOD

## Abstract
A method of forming a valve body section with integral hub 14 comprises forcing a cylindrical workpiece down into a die 28 with a general spherical concave upper sur face 30 and a coaxial receptacle 32 of circular cross section depending therefrom. The workpiece is forced down into the die 28 so that the lower end 14 is constricted into the smaller diameter cylindrical extension to form a valve hub while the upper end conforms to the concave spherical surface 30 . Two of the sections so formed are welded together around their upper ends to form a one piece spher ical valve body with integral hubs.
