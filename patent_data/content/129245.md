# Method and apparatus for controlling a robot.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for controlling a robot wherein a force signal F is calulated by detecting a force 16 applied to a hand of the robot, a first value representing a difference between the force signal and a force reference is calculated, a second value representing a product of a difference between a position signal PE representing current position and attitude of the hand and a position reference, multiplied by a spring constant is calculated, a third value representing a product of a velocity signal representing a current velocity TG of the hand, multiplied by a viscosity coefficient is calculated, and a command velocity of the hand is calculated based on the first, second and third values and a mass coefficient.
