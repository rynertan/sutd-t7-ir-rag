# Multi needle syringe for filling through a barrel plunger, particularly useful in mesotherapy.

## Abstract
A syringe is disclosed the main feature of which is that its plunger 5 is bored longitudinally with a conduit and provided with an inlet fitting to which an ordinary hollow injection needle 10 can be mounted after removing a cap 4 supplied with it. This arrangement enables the syringe to be filled from the rear and directly into the interior of the graduated barrel 1 where medicines can be metered and mixed for subsequent delivery, through an offtake head 2, 2a, 2b, 7 , to a number of needles, the outlet fittings for which are individually screened by a form of trap. The latter arrangement is directed to balance the flows through all the outlet fittings, since otherwise, the middle outlet fittings, i.e. those aligned with or placed the closest to the outlets conveying the liquid into the offtake head, would be favoured.

## Description
MULTI NEEDLE SYRINGE POR FILLING THROUGH A BARRED PLUNGER, PARTICCLARLY USBPD IN ESOTHEIL t In mesotherapeutical treatments, in order to obtain biological responses or desensitising effects, infradermal injections of specific medicinal mixtures are applied which, for their improved distribution through the derma depth, are split into small doses by means of syringes having special multi needle offtakos. Such offtakes comprise a cylindrical body of metal construction throughout which encloses a cavity in communication with a collar for connection to an ordinary syringe, at an end wall opposite to outlet fittings for injec tion needles the latter being distributed, as regards their number and arrangement, in accordance with a specific treatment for which each offtake pattern is intended. Lacking alternatives, metal offtakes have gained widespread acceptance even though their high cost makes it necessary to reuse each element for an indefinite number of applications, despite the fact that sterilisation, even where carefully carried out, may fail to ensure removal of residual substances from non inspectable areas in the cavity. In seeking a solution which could obviate such a serious deficiency, it has also been thought of simplifying the syringe filling operations, because accurate metering of the various medicines to be mixed together currently requires the availability of a smaller syringe for drawing, from either vials or flacons, each component in the correct amount and then transferring it into the large syringe through a fitting in the offtake or, after temporarily removing the plunger, directly into the barrel. The syringe filling operation is made relatively easier if the medicines can be picked up from vials which are pre packaged with the required amounts, or if the graduation on the mixing barrel can be made sufficient for the amounts to be metered. In such cases, albeit unfrequently occurring, it is sufficient to temporarily remove the offtake and connect to the syringe an ordinary injection needle. Before turning to the description of the novel syringe, it would be appropriate to point out that, for each mesotherapeutical treatment, it is common practice to admix the medicines to a diluting liquid physiologic solution or bi distilled water which is added in a significant proportion to bring the whole composition to an overall volume of 20 cm of which only a small proportion is then injected. This explains why such a syringe may have features which render it uncapable of injecting all of the liquid contained therein. The accompanying illustrative, and not imitative drawings consist of two sheets comprising the following figures Figures 1,2 and 3 are side, top, and bottom viewsre spectively, of a syringe having a barrel plunger and circular offtake for seven needles, both being complete with special caps Figure 4 is a longitudinal section AA throughFigure 1 Figures 5 and 6 are cross sections BB and CC through Figure 4 Figure 7 is a partly cutaway side view of a syringe with the barrel plunger shown during the filling step and the offtake outlet fittings of the type having seven in line needles necessarily covered by the special air tight caps Figure 8 is a cross section DD through Figure 7 Figure 9 shows views of the element to be slipped over each the two barrel grips for centering the cylindrical rod of the plunger. As shown in drawing sheet 1, the syringe, which is formed from a suitable plastic material, comprises a graduated barrel 1 provided with grips 1s as with ordinary syringes but having a perforated end wall against which the plunger abuts and whence a small collar protrudes for the preferably pressure fitting of an offtake 2 the offtake 2 is formed in two parts 2a and 2B which are joined together, preferably by ultrasonic welding, forming a distribution chamber therebetween, the interior of said distribution chamber defining a constmined siphon like passage for each individual outlet fitting causing uniform distribution of the liquid flowing out of the distribution chamber through the set of holes formed in the part 2A simibrly to those formed through the end wall of the barrel 1. Furthermore, there are advantageously present air tight caps 3 slipped over all of the outlet fittings of the offtake 2 to allow the syringe to be filled from the rear through the hollow plunger a cap 4 for attachment, after the syringe has been filled, to the outer end of th. plunger in order to seal the outlet fitting in an air tight fashion and provide adequate support for the hand pushing it in use a plunger 5 having a finned rod and an elastic seal 6, a conduit extending over its entire length from the head with the elastic seal 6 to the outer end fashioned as an inlet fitting, so that a needle can be attached to it which is then replaced with the special cap 4 once the filling drawing operation has been completed. It has been stated in the foregoing that the multi needle offtake is pressure fitted onto the collar of the syringe barrel, and this in order, as is the case with currently available means, for the mesotherapeutical operator, in treating the same patient, to be able to select and mount the most suitable offtakes for the various intervention areas. It is not to be excluded, though, that the barrel and offtake may be welded together, preferably ultrasonically, to form a single body, and in such a case, the barrel could have a uniform cross section and be without the perforated end wall, the function of which is mainly that of preventing accidental disengagement of the offtake owing to the plunger being pushed too far. By so embodying multi needle syringes, the added advantage would be secured of a reduction, by about 1 cm3, of the dead zone, i.e. of the non injectable liquid. On the other hand, however, the operator would have limitations to his intervention and the whole syringe would have to be disposed of after each intervention, whereas with the interchangeable offtake system, the barrel and plunger, if made of a sterilisable material, could be resused for several interventions. Further, by making the offtakes removable, the caps 3 of the individual outlet fittings could be replaced with a single air tight cap, applied as the syringe is being filled, to the collar of the barrel 1 in lieu of the offtake 2. The syringe of drawing sheet 2 is shown during the filling step and with a needle 10 fitted in the inlet fitting of the plunger, whilst the syringe of drawing sheet 1 is alternatively provided with a different offtake from the previous one in that the needle outlet fittings are not rectilinearly aligned. However, this offtake is also configured internally with the siphonlike outlet fittings as at 2 in Figure 4 and as in all the other offtakes which will be required for the various areas of mesotherapeutical intervention. The plunger 8 is also different from that shown in drawing sheet 1, in that the former has four longitudinal web ribs which ensure constant centering in the barrel 1, and accordingly, a constantly effective tightness of the seal 6, whereas the latter, having a cylindrical rod, is held in a centered or coaxial trim with the barrel by virtue of a pair of elements 9 which, embodied as in the views of Figure 9 and section ofFigure 7, clamp the grips 1A between two flat portions 9A and 9B, and the latter, in addition to restricting the barrel mouth is latched to it through a dog or elevation 9C formed thereon. The variation with the cylindrical rod plunger 8 has been provided mainly to facilitate imprinting of an optional graduation because the conduit size is such as to enable metering of amounts so small that the mere graduation on the outer barrel 1 could not indicate with as much accuracy. tile the expedients described have been mainly devised to obviate some serious deficiencies of multineedle syringes for mesotherapeutical use, this does not exclude a possible combination of the novel hollow and graduated plunger type with the barrels of ordinary syringes with a single needle, where to fill them, perfect metering of small amounts of liquid substances to be mixed is required.
