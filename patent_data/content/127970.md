# Magnetic stirrer apparatus with guided, floating stirrer.

## Abstract
A magnetic stirrer apparatus includes a vessel for liquid and a floating stirrer. The floating stirrer is rotated by a mag net driven by a magnetic field generator laterally of the vessel, and a guide rod through the floating stirrer restricts its move ment to rotary movement and substantially vertical move ment with change in the liquid level. The magnetic field generator is operative at any level of the liquid in the vessel.
