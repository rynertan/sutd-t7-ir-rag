# Method for manufacturing a semiconductor memory device having a high radiation resistance.

## Abstract
In a method for manufacturing a semiconductor memory device, a semiconductor chip 1 , optionally having a surface layer 2 , and an adhesive tape 9 having an adhesive layer 10 are prepared. The adhesive layer comprises a polyamic acid intermediate derived for example from a pyromellitic di anhydride and a diamine. The adhesive tape is pressed onto the semiconductor chip under heating at a temperature of from about 250 C to about 400 C for a predetermined time period such as 2 to 5 sec.
