# Cathodoluminescent particles for multicolour displays and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A single particle penetration phosphor employs La₂O₂S Tb particles as a core particle 14 having a thin layer of La₂O₂SO₄ Tb formed thereon by oxidation to provide a barrier 16 which must be penetrated by excitation electrons to produce narrow bandwidth green spectral emission from the particle. The thin barrier 16 is in turn coated by a layer 18 of YVO₄ Eu particles which produce narrow bandwidth red spectral emission upon electron excitation. The barrier layer 16 increases the voltage turn on characteristic of the green carrier host, thereby causing the electron irradiated phosphor to radiate in the red spectrum for low voltages and in the green spectrum for higher voltages. Additionally, methods are disclosed for synthesising the above single particle penetration phosphor.
