# APPARATUS FOR SUPPORTING A PROTECTIVE MASK OPTICAL INSERT

## Abstract
An optical lens carrying support structure for use with a protective face mask, comprising a pair of lens frames 1 , each frame comprising an eyewire 2 and a hinge portion 4 , the lens frames being connected by a hinged nosepiece 3, 5 . The support structure attaches to the face mask by a slideably releasable dove tail connection 27, 29 to a trapezoidal back block 25 , which back block rigidly attaches to the face mask, with two opposite faces of the trapezoidal back block inclined with respect to each other so as to establish the proper pan toscopic angle. The face form angle is accomplished by virtue of an angled relation of the eyewire 2 to the hinge portion 4 of the lens frame 1 . The lens frames 1 fold back toward each other, facilitating removal of the lenses and folding the face mask assembly flat making it easy to remove the lens 107 by snapping it out of the eyewire 2 .
