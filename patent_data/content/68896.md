# Image distortion free, image rotation free electron microscope.

## Abstract
A transmission electron microscope comprises an imaging electron lens system constituted in at least five stages by an objective lens 10 , a group of intermediate lenses 12, 14 and a group of projector lenses 16, 18 to which excitation currents are applied with alternately diffe rent polarities. Lens current control means 24 is provided for controlling the excitation currents I
