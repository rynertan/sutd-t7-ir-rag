# Optical tool for aligning transducer head assemblies.

## Abstract
An optical tool 9 is disclosed which permits a sequence of aligned transducer gaps to be positioned parallel to the axis of a disk file. The tool is surfaced with transparent material 16, 17, 18 , has a thickness the same as the disk or disks of a disk stack being simulated and presents an etched alignment grid 17 at the interface surface between trans ducer and tool. The virtually common plane of the transducer gap and etched grid substantially eliminates parallax and the unfilled etched grid permits the gap to be seen, whether aligned with the transparent unetched surface or the translu cent etched surface portion. The use of inclined mirrored surfaces 16 underlying the grid permits alignment to be effected using a bright field microscope and observing from a direction rotated 90 degrees from a line perpendicular to the grid to enable alignment of transducer gaps confronting one another at opposite sides of the disk.
