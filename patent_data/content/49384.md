## Description
N DENITRATION OF N,2,6 TRINITROANILINES WITH PHASE TRANSFER CATALYSTS The invention provides a procedure for the rapid elimination of a nitro group attached to the amino function of a secondary trinitroaniline of formula I obtained during the preparation of herbicidal dinitroaniline compounds of formula II both schematically illustrated below EMI1.1 wherein R is C1 C6 alkyl straight chain, or preferably branched, especially secondary alkyl, C4 C6 cycloalkyl, C1 C4 monohaloalkyl or C1 C4 alkoxy C2 C4 alkyl Y is C1 C4 alkyl, halogen or CF3 X is hydrogen, halogen, C1C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 monohaloalkyl or C1 C4 alkoxy Cl C4 alkyl wherein the above denitration procedure comprises reacting the formula I compound with a phase transfer catalyst in the presence of an aqueous solution of a strong base, as hereinbelow discussed and described in detail. Among the compounds represented by formula I and II , a preferred group of compounds are those whereinR is C3 C6 alkyl straight chain, or preferably a. secondary alkyl Y is C1 C3 alkyl or CF3 X is hydrogen, CH3 or CH3OCH2. The most preferred compounds of formulae I and II are those wherein R is l ethylpropyl Y is methyl or isopropyl X is methyl or methoxymethyl. The compounds of formula I are obtained as the unwanted by products of nitration reactions designed to prepare the herbicidal dinitroanilines of formula II . It should be noted here that, in the course of the abovereferred to nitration reactions, N nitroso dinitroanilines of formula IV are formed too. The above referred to nitration reaction is hereinbelow schematically illustrated EMI2.1 The unwanted by products of this reaction are EMI2.2 wherein in the above reaction scheme, R, X and Y are as hereinabove defined and V and W are both hydrogen, or if only one of them is hydrogen, then the other must be nitro. The compounds of formula III may be nitrated conveniently by dissolving same in an inert water immiscible solvent, such as ethylene dichloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, monochlorobenzene, and the like, and preferably ethylene dichloride, and monochlorobenzene, and then the solution is added to a stirred nitration mixture consisting of nitric acid and sulfuric acid at a rate designed to control the ensuing exothermic reaction within the desired temperature limits. On completion of the reaction, the organic phase is separated. This phase contains in addition to the desired herbicides of formula 11 theN nitro I and N nitroso IV dinitroaniline impurities.Obviously, formation of compounds of formulae I and IV results in lower yields of the desired formula II herbicidal dinitroanilines. Advantageously, the formula IV impurities may be reconverted by chemical means to the desired formula II products, and, consequently, the yield of these herbicides II can be improved. More important is, however, the fact that these unwanted impurities, especially of formula IV , may be either completely eliminated from, or at least lowered to acceptable levels in the products IIy. Thus, it is known that formula IV nitroso compounds may be denitrosated with sulfamic acid to the corresponding formula ski pesticides either by treating the nitration mixture or the isolated organic phase with sulfamic acid. This denitrosation reaction may be carried out, however, more advantageously by the method of UnitedStates Patent No. 4,134,917, issued January 16, 1979 Assignee American Cyanamid Company , incorporated herein by way of reference and illustrated in Example 5. It should be noted here, that the thermal decomposition of formula I N nitroanilines may also result in the formation of formula IV N nitrosoanilines, as illustrated below EMI4.1 wherein R, X and Y are as hereinabove defined The significance of this reaction is in that after the N nitroso com pounds of formula CIV have been removed from the abovediscussed nitration mixture of the product isolated therefrom, any formula I N nitroaniline present in either the organic phase of the nitration mixture or in the product isolated therefrom, may thermally decompose and regenerate this undesirable contaminant CIV . The N denitration of secondary N nitroamines is known to take place when these compounds are heated in aqueous potassium hydroxide. We find, however, that this denitration does not proceed at an acceptable rate with the N,2,6 trinitroanilines of formula I of the present invention. Advantageously, by the novel method of the present invention, N nitroanilines of formula I may be removed from the above said nitration mixture or the products isolated therefrom with bases in the presence of phase transfer catalysts Thus, the separated organic phase of a nitration mixture comprising a solution of compounds of formulae I , II and IV in a solvent, such as ethylene dichloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, monochlorobenzene, and the like, preferably ethylene dichloride, or chlorobenzene, is first denitrosated by the method of United States PatentNo. 4,134,917 and is then mixed with a phase transfer catalyst selected from ternary and quaternary salts of formula V RÚ . Z V n wherein n is an integer of 2,3 or 4 and thus R1 represents two, three or 4 substitutent in formula V compound, wherein each of these may be the same or different and is selected from C1 C16 alkyl straight chain or branched , C3 C7 cycloalkyl optionally substituted with C1 C3 alkyl, benzyl, substituted benzyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl wherein the substituent is halogen, C1 C3 alkyl, C1 C3 alkoxy and the like Q is N,P, As or S anion Z is C1, Br, I, H SO4, CH3SO4,H2P03 or H2P04. Other phase transfer catalysts may be selected from macrocylic and macrobicyclic ethers such as 18 Crown 6 and 2,2,2 cryptateEMI5.1 18 Crown 6 2,2,2 cryptate polyethers such as polyethylene glycols of formula HOCCH2CH O m CH2CH20H wherein m is an integer of 40 to 50 phosphate esters such as the mono and diesters of orthophosphonic acid made from certain ethylene oxide adducts or from C4 C7 cycloalkyl alcohols wherein the latter may be substituted, if so desired as illustrated below EMI6.1 wherein R is C1 C3 alkyl, r is an integer of from 8 to 25 orEMI6.2 wherein R is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl s is an integer of from 1 to 4 sulfate ester analogs of the above may also be used N alkyl phosphoramides, methylene bridged phosphorus and sulfur oxides quaternized heterocyclic compounds such as alkylpyridinium salts or various substituted pyrazolium salts. Among the phase transfer catalysts discussed and described above the following are of particular interest tetra n butylammonium salts, tricapryl methylammonium salts, benzyl trimethylammonium salts, tetra n butylphosphonium salts, hexadecylpyridinium salts, 1,2 dimethyl 3,5diphenylpyrazolium salts, 18 Crown 6 ether, and the like, and wherein said salts are the chlorides, bromides, hydrogen sulfate, methyl sulfates, dihydrogen phosphates and the like. The above phase transfer catalysts are used in amounts of from about 0.15 mole to about 4.0 moles, and preferably 0.8 mole to 3.0 moles per mole of said formula I compound, and then an aqueous base, selected from sodium or potassium hydroxide or carbonate, ammonium hydroxide or carbonate, is added in amounts sufficient to maintain a pH of 7 or more throughout the reaction. The resulting two phase mixture is rapidly agitated at reflux by suitable means for a period of from 5 to 120 minutes, or until the reaction is essentially complete, and the amount of formula I compound originally present in said mixture is reduced to zero or to an acceptable level. Next, the two phases are separated, and the described herbicidal 2,6 dinitroaniline of formula II is recovered from the organic phase. Thus, for instance, 200 g of the organic phase of a nitration reaction, from which the N l ethylpropyl 2,6 dinitro N nitroso 3,4 xylidine has been removed by the denitrosation method of United States Patent No. 4,134,917 and now comprises a solution of 120 g of N l ethylpropyl 2,b dinitro 3,4 xylidine and 0.3 g of N l ethylpropyl N,2,6 trinitro 3,4 xylidine in 80 g of ethylene dichloride is mixed with 20 g of 10 sodium hydroxide solution and 0.36 g of benzyl triethylammonium chloride. The resulting two phase reaction mixture is agitated rapidly by suitable means and heated at reflux for one hour, diluted with water, the organic phase separated, and the product isolated by standard laboratory procedures. The isolated product is found to be free of the corresponding formula I nitramine. Substitution of tetra n butylphosphonium chloride, tri C4 hydroxyphenyl sulfonium chloride, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, 1, 2 dimethyl 3 , 5 diphenylpyrazolium methylsulfate, 18 Crown 6 ether of formulaEMI8.1 12,2,23 cryptate of formulaEMI8.2 for benzyl triethylammonium chloride in the above procedure results in formula II product, essentially free of the undesired nitramine of formula I .
