# Herbicidal heterooxybenzenes.

## Abstract
Compounds of the formula CHEM wherein A is H, NO2 or halogen B is H, alkyl, alkenyl, halogen, NO2, CN, SCN, CHO, alkoxy, alkylcarbonyl or alkoxycarbonyl Q 1 and Q 2 are each O or S X is N or CH W and Z are each H, alkyl, alkenyl, halogen, NO2, CN, CF3 or alkoxycarbonyl exhibit pre emergence and post emergence activity against many grassy and broadleaved weeds. They may be formulated for use in conventional manner. The novel compounds may be prepared by reacting a corresponding compound of formula CHEM e.g. successively in either order, with compounds of formulae CHEM wherein Y is a leaving group. According to another feature of the invention an ortho 5 halopyridin 2 yloxy phenol is prepared by heating to a melt a mixture or catechol and an appropriately substituted 2,5 dihalopyridine under an inert atmosphere.
