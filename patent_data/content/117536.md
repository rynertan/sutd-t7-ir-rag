# A method of making a multiphase polyethylene structure, and a cross country ski sole.

## Abstract
A cross country ski sole having a low dynamic coeffi cient of friction on wet or dry snow while exhibiting a very high static friction is disclosed. This ski sole has a multi phase structure of a polyethylene film having embedded therein a plurality of polyethylene particles of greater hard ness or melt index than the film. Also disclosed is a method for making the multiphase polyethylene structures of this in vention.
