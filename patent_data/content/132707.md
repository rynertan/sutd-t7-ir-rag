# NOVEL SYSTEM FOR THE PRODUCTION OF POLYURETHANES

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to a polyol blend com prising a polyether polyol having at least two and no more than three hydroxyl groups and from about 5 to about 40 percent by weight based on the total weight of the two com ponents of a dispersion of a polyurea and or polyhydrazo dicarbonamide in an organic compound containing at least one hydroxyl group, the solids content of said blend being from about 1 to about 8 percent by weight. The polyol blend is useful in the production of polyurethane products.
