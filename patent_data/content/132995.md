# CONTROLLER FOR CONTROLLING ACCESS TO A PLURALITY OF RECORDS THAT CAN BE ACCESSED AND CHANGED BY SEVERAL INDEPENDENT PROCESSORS

## Abstract
A controller for controlling access to a plurality of records that can be accessed and changed by several independent processors comprises a plurality of flip flops corresponding in number to the plurality of records with each flip flop rep resenting a particular record a means for receiving a prog rammable control word from any of the processors which identifies multiple records of which access is sought a means for selecting in parallel and logically ANDing output signals from all of those flip flops which correspond to the identified records a means for sending a signal, if the ANDing operation yields a logical ONE, to the processor which sent the control word signaling that it may access and change the identified records a means for setting in parallel via a single pulse all of those flip flops which correspond to the identified records if the ANDing operation yields a logical ONE and a means for storing the control word if the ANDing operation yields a logical ZERO.
