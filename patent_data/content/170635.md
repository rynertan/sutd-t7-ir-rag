# Swivel handlebar, in particular for power lawn mowers.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a swivel handlebar, intended in particular for power lawn mowers, which comprises a shaft 4 anchored to the body of the mower 1 in such a way as to permit of being set in a number of distinct positions relative to the mower itself. A device 9 controlled from a lever at the grip 3 of the handlebar locks and releases the shaft 4 into and from the different relative positions.

## Claims
Claims A swivel handlebar, in particular for power lawn mowers, characterised in that it has at least one shaft 4 by way of which the grip 3 of the handlebar 2 is connected with the mower 1 , and in that the handlebar shaft is anchored to the body of the mower in such a way as to permit of being set in a number of distinct positions relative thereto. Handlebar as in claim 1 wherein the base of the shaft 4 is hinged to the body of the mower 1 in such a way as to swivel on a vertical axis and wherein a device 9 controlled from the grip 3 of the handlebar permits of locking and releasing the shaft 4 into and from a number of distinct positions. Handlebar as in claims 1 2 wherein the base of the shaft 4 is integral with a swivel pin 5 planted rotatably in a cylindrical socket 6 disposed with axis vertical and forming part of the body of the mower 1 and wherein relative axial movement of the swivel pin 5 and the socket 6 is disallowed. 4 A lawn mower as in preceding claims, characterised in that the device 9 incorporates a catch mechanism consisting of a pin 10 which can be located in any one of a number of holes 11 provided in a circular plate embodied integral and coaxial with the top of the cylindrical socket 6 , such a pin 10 being urged into a single hole 11 by the agency of a spring 12 loaded between the pin itself and the base of the shaft 4 and, in that the pin 10 can be pulled, so as to withdraw completely from the hole 11 that it occupies at a given moment, by way of control means 13 consisting of a cable and sheath operated from a lever mounted to the handlebar grip 3 which will apply pulling effort of sufficient force to overcome the force exerted by the spring 12 .

## Description
Swivel handleb in articular for power lawn mowers The invention relates to a swivel handlebar, intended in particular for power lawn mowers.Power lawn mowers of a conventional type have a handlebar, incorporating either one or two shafts, which in certain conditions prevents the machine from operating that is to say, it is the very position of the handlebar and the grip that disallows mowing of the grass beneath hedges and low shrubbery or plants. At all events, use of the mower is rendered difficult where available headroom is so low as to admit passage of the mower itself, and nothing more.The invention described herein sets out to solve the problem thus outlined, thereby eliminating the drawbacks and limitations of use which beset power lawn mowers of a general conventional type.A swivel handlebar is disclosed, intended in particular for power lawn mowers, comprising at least one shaft that connects the grip of the handlebar with the mower and is anchored to the body of the mower in such a way a to permit of being set in a number of distinct positions relative thereto. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with the aid of the accompanying drawings, in which fig 1 is a schematic representation of the invention, viewing from the front fig 2 is the plan of fig 1 from above fig 3 shows a detail of the section through II II in fig 2, on enlarged scale fig 4 shows a view from above of the circular plate with its locking holes.With reference to the drawings, 1 denotes a power lawn mower provided with a swivel handlebar 2.The handlebar 2 incorporates a grip 3, and a shaft 4 that furnishes the connection between the grip and the mower proper. The shaft 4 is angled relative to the horizontal and associated with the body of the mower 1 in such a way as to permit of its being set in a number of distinct positions, in relation to the mower itsel. More exactly, the base of the handlebar shaft 4 is t planted in the mower such as to turn, i.e. swivel, about a vertical axis, the bottom end being integral with a swivel pin 5 which is seated, rotatably, in a cylindrical socket 6 disposed with axis vertical and forming part of the mower body. The swivel pin 5 is disallowed movement in an axial direction relative to ss the socket 6, being held fast by a pin, for instance, or a screw 7, which projects radially into the cylin T drical socket 6 in order to locate in a circumferentiaj groove 8 offered by the pin.The handlebar incorporates a device 9, embodied integral with the swivel pin 5 and operated from the grip 3, which is designed to permit of locking and releasin g the handlebar into and from a given position relative to the mower 1. The device 9 incorporates a catch mechanism consisting of a pin 10 which can be located in any one of a number of holes 11 provided in a circular plate embodied integral and coaxial with the top of the cylindrical socket 6.The pin 10 is urged against the circular plate, and more to the point, urged into the single hole 11, by the agency of a spring 12 loaded between the pin itself and the base of the shaft 4, and can be pulled so as to withdraw completely from the hole 11 that it occupies at a given moment by way of control means 13 consisting, say, of a cable and sheath as in fig 3 operated from a lever mounted to the grip 3. Working such a lever, a pulling effort can be applied at the pin 10 of sufficient force to overcome the downward force exerted by the spring 12, so as to withdraw the pin from the hole 11 and raise it above the level of the circular plate, thereby allowing the swivel pin 5, hence the entire handlebar assembly, to turn in the cylindrical socket 6 about a vertical axis.In this state, the handlebar 2 can be swivelled freely so as to bring it into the required position, whereupon release of the control means will re lock the shaft to the mower 1 by causing the pin 10 to locate in one of the holes 11, urged downwards by the spring 12.Rotation of the handlebar 2 about the vertical axis of the swivel pin 5 is illustrated to advantage in fig 2. The fact of being able to swivel the handlebar and offset it to one side of the mower is instrumental in allowing the mower access to areas with limited headroom, where the handlebar itself would otherwise obstruct such access. In such situations, the operator can swing the handlebar into position B, for example, and walk forward alongside the mower 1 without any difficulty. Where there is no such requirement for the mower s gaining access to areas with limited headroom, the handlebar 2 can be returned the normal position A in which the operator walks forward behind the mower, rather than alongside. Practical application of the invention may be seen to be abundantly simple the operator has direct control at any given moment by virtue of the fact that the lever which operates the device 9 for locking and release of the pin 10 into and from the holes 11 is mounted to the handlebar grip 3.
