# A method and apparatus for rolling an elongated tube to a conical mast without the use of an internal mandrel.

## Abstract
At least one area of the outside of the tube 1 is brought into contact with each time at least one roll 3, 4 rotatable around its axis, whereas this roll and the tube are brought into a relative movement with respect to each other, in which the contact surface of the roll and tube, considered between two planes spaced in longitudinal direction of the tube, are displaced to the longitudinal axis of the tube. The contact surfaces of the rotatable rolls 3, 4 with the deformed tube 1 following one or more space spira les at conically rolled tube or one or more helical lines at cylindrical rolled tube, whereas the position of the effective roll surfaces is adjustable with respect to the longitudinal axis and the transverse axis of the tube, and the contact area with the one or more rolls is heated 2 to the roll temperature before the rolling. Metal or plastic material could be processed. Use as light masts.
