# Intermodal transport.

## Abstract
A transport container 22 for use in an intermodal transport system has a base with a central region for supporting the container on the ground and opposite end regions which are spaced above the ground when the container is supported by the central region. The opposite end regions are at a higher level than the central region so that a respective wheel assembly for example a bogie 19 can be placed in spaces 15 under the opposite end regions, thereby supporting the container clear of the ground. The wheel assemblies are coupled to the container by respective coupling means, e.g. fifth wheel couplings. Two or more containers can be combined with the bogie to form a road or rail train, with adjacent containers being supported by and coupled to a coupling bogie. The container is capable of sustaining between its ends a tensile or compressive load of at least 180,000 kilogrammes force so that it is capable of withstanding the high loads applied during rail travel.
