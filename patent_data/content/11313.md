## Abstract
A digital multiplex type vehicle electrical switching sys tem includes a transmitter and a plurality of receivers, each controlling a group of load devices L₁....L₄ . The transmitter produces a sequence of multibit digital words on a data bus 10 , each word including a plurality of address bits followed by a number of utilization code bits identifying the required state of the load devices associated with the receiver having an address code corresponding the address bits in the word. Each receiver includes an input register 50 and, at the start of each word, all the receiver input registers receive the address code. Each receiver also includes address code recognition means 56 which responds only to one address code. Only that receiver in which the address code is recognised, accepts the utilization code into its input register, the address code recognition means of all the other receivers operating to block the input registers thereof.
