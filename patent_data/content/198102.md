# Tape loading mechanism.

## Abstract
A tape loading mechanism K for helically winding a tape 2 around a guide cylinder 3 by drawing the tape 2 out of a tape cassette 1 , including a tape take off pin 16 functioning also as a pin for detecting tension of the tape 2 , a tape loading device P, Q for winding the tape 2 around the guide cylinder 3 over a predetermined winding angle, a cam 44 driven in response to displacement of the tape loading device P, Q and formed with a cam groove 44a , a shaft 17 and a back tension lever 15 pivotal about the shaft 17 and provided with the tape take off pin 16 . The back tension lever 15 is operatively associated with the cam groove 44a so as to be controlled in its pivotal move ment.
