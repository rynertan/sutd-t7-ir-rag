## Description
HIGH CONDUCTIVITY THIONYL CHLORIDE ELECTROLYTES The invention is directed to electrochemical cells having anodes made of active metal above hydrogen in the EMF series and having an inorganic liquid oxyhalide cathode depolarizer, and more particularly to the improvement of electrolyte conductivity and reduction of voltage delay in the lithiumthionyl chloride cell. It has become evident to the art that electrochemical cells having active metal anodes, i.e., anodes made of a metal having an activity higher than hydrogen in the EMF series, offer advantages particularly in terms of high energy density. Since the metals to be employed as anode, e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium, lithium , and their alloys, react with water a non aqueous medium is employed. Cells employing liquid oxyhalide as cathode depolarizer, a metal such as lithium as anode, a porous carbon current collector have been described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,926,669, U.K. Patent No. 1,409,307, etc.Liquid oxyhalides such as thionyl chloride have poor electrical conductivity, hence an electrolyte salt such as lithium aluminum tetrachloride is dissolved therein to improve conductivity. The resulting system has been found to he susceptible to the problem of voltage delay, to wit, a dip in operating voltage below a defined cutoff voltage after application of a load and the time required to rise back to the cutoff voltage. The problem is a serious one since many electronic devices to be powered thereby require a specified and substantially constant voltage to be efficiently operative. The problem and suggested solutions are described in U.S. Patents No. 4,238,552 and No.4,228,229. It is considered that the voltage delay problem may be associated in some way with the use of lithium aluminum tetrachloride as the conductivity improving salt in the electrolyte. However, the search for a substitute material which would enhance conductivity and reduce voltage delay in the electrolyte has been difficult and unpredictable. Thus, many salts are either insoluble or insufficiently soluble or nonconductive, or both in thionyl chloride. The reason for this is the extremely low dielectric constant of thionyl chloride SOCl2 . For SOC12, the dielectric constant is 9.25 at 200C whereas the dielectric constant for water is 80.1 at 200C. The lower the dielectric constant for a solvent, the harder it is for a salt to ionize in and contribute conductivity to, the solvent solute system. In contrast to SOC12, many salts can dissolve in and ionize in water to provide aqueous electrolytes having orders of magnitude greater productivity than SOCl2 electrolytes. U.S. Patent No. 4,307,160 describes a lithiumthionyl chloride cell wherein niobium pentachloride is dissolved in the thionyl chloride, but the resulting battery is said to be suitable only for low rate applications indicating that niobium pentachloride alone does not materially increase the conductivity of thionyl chloride. The conductivity of thionyl chloride for use in a non aqueous battery having an active metal anode such as lithium and a porous carbon cathode current collector is improved by dissolving therein niobium pentachloride and a compound of the group consisting of lithium bromide, lithium sulfide, lithium oxide and lithium chloride. In accordance with the invention, the desired combination of conductivity enhancing ingredients is preferably added to purified thionyl chloride in approximately equimolar amounts.The quantities of equimolar mixture dissolved in thionyl chloride may be in the range of 0.1 molar to 1 molar or more, depending upon the performance desired. The resulting electrolyte is then used to make up cells having lithium anodes and porous carbon current collectors. A marked reduction in voltage delay of the lithium anode results using electrolytes containing combinations of NbCl5 and either or both Li2O and Li2S as compared to cathode electrolytes of thionyl chloride containing lithium aluminum tetrachloride. Examples will now be given EXAMPLE 1 As set forth in the following Table, combinations of conductivity enhancing ingredients were added to 40 ml aliquots of thionyl chloride and the conductivities of the resulting solutions were determined at 260 270C with a measuring frequency of 1 KHZ. The results are set forth in the Table I. It is notable that while a 1M niobium pentachloride addition was ineffective in increasing conductivity, and that lithium sulfide alone has little conductivity, the combinations of any of lithium chloride, lithium bromide, lithium oxide or lithium sulfide with niobium pentachloride was highly effective. EXAMPLE 2 Flooded cell tests using three lithium electrodes demonstrated the marked improvement in voltage delay using certain electrolytes provided in accordance with the invention. In the test, current was passed at an anode current density of 6 mA cm2 from the anode to a counterelectrode and the potential difference with respect to a lithium reference electrode was measured over time. The electrodes were TABLE I SOCl2 ELECTROLYTE CONDUCTIVITIES Temp.

The voltage time curve resulting from the test typically drops swiftly to a voltage representing the maximum anode polarization, then recovers at a variable rate to a steady state. The smaller the voltage drop, the less the anode polarization and hence the less the voltage delay. Testing in an electrolyte of thionyl chloride having added lM NbCl5 and Li2S based on dry salt weight and SOCl2 volume a lithium anode yielded a maximum anode polarization voltage of 0.335 as against an anode polarization voltage of 5.815 using a thionyl chloride electrolyte containing LiAlCl4 at 1.6M concentration. The test constituted a further indication that the SOCl2 LiAlCl4 electrolyte itself contributes to the voltage delay problem. EXAMPLE 3 Further tests were conducted in thionyl chloride electrolytes containing NbCl5 and Li2S as prepared in Example 2. In one set of tests the lithium anodes were smooth while in the other set the anodes were embossed mechanically to increase the surface area by a factor of two. The results are set forth in the following Table II wherein x denotes the average maximum anode polarization, denotes the standard deviation and art denotes the number of tests.

EXAMPLE 4 Further testing conducted as in Example 2 as set forth in Table III demonstrated that NbCls dissolved by itself in thionyl chloride does not aid voltage delay but contributes to it, and that an addition of equimolar NbCls Li2S based on dry salt weight and SOC12 volume reduces voltage delay in SOCl2 LiAlC14. NbCl5 Li2O was also effective. Best results are achieved with SOC12 by adding equimolar amounts of NbCl5 andLi2S to thionyl chloride. Smooth lithium anodes were used. The data in Table III are an average of at least two measurements per variation.

EXAMPLE 5 Niobium chloride and lithium sulfide were added singly and in combination to thionyl chloride and the resulting electrolytes were then analyzed with the results set forth in the following Table IV.

The indications are that the complex salt which is formed contains approximately one molecule of Li2S for each two molecules ofNbCl5. An empirical formula for the salt appears to be close to Li2Snb2Cl10. However, when 1.0M NbC15 is mixed with 0.5MLi2S a 2 1 ratio in thionyl chloride, the resulting cathodeelectrolyte is not as effective in reducing voltage delay as is the case when a 1 1 mixing ratio is used.A 1 1 mixing ratio is also preferred for Li2O NbCl5 and an empirical formula close to Li2ONb2CllO is postulated. EXAMPLE 6 An electrolyte of NbCl5 Li2S provided in accordance with the invention was compared to A1C13 Li2S, both in thionyl chloride with the results set forth in the followingTable V. The technique of Example 2 was employed and duplicate tests were run.

EXAMPLE 7 The concentration of the NbC15 Li2S complex salt in thionyl chloride can be increased by initially forming the complex in thionyl chloride, evaporating the excess thionyl chloride and redissolving the complex salt residue in fresh thionyl chloride to form a new electrolyte. The conductivity of the new electrolyte is also increased. The following TableVI demonstrates the foregoing. TABLE VI in SoCl2 Conductivity mS Original NbC15 Li2S 13.2 0.91M 0.96MRedissolved NbCl5 Li2S 16.5 1.42M 1.64M in SOC12 LiAlC14 in SOC12 20.4 1.60M Electrolysis of a thionyl chloride NbCl5 Li2S electrolyte using a nickel cathode at a potential sufficient to plate out the cation of the complex salt produced a deposit which was essentially lithium, thereby showing that Li is the cation of the new complex salt. It is also to be understood that alloys of lithium containing small amounts of aluminum, magnesium, and possibly other metals may be employed in place of lithium metal as anode.Similarly, lithium anodes having a surface layer of aluminum may be employed. While the invention has been described and illustrated in terms of a thionyl chloride cathode electrolyte solvent, it is to be understood that co solvents such as phosphoryl chloride may be employed in certain instances while still obtaining the basic and novel characteristics of the invention. Electron microscope examination of lithium anodes exposed respectively to thionyl chloride LiAlC14 electrolytes and to thionyl chloride electrolytes of the invention demonstrated that the anode film resulting when electrolytes of the invention are employed is markedly more open as compared to the densely populated, blocky precipitate believed to beLiCl noted on the anode when LiAlC14 is used to enhance conductivity. These observations confirm that electrolytes of the invention are considerably less passivating than those used heretofore. Although the present invention has been described in conjunction with preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that modifications and variations may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as those skilled in the art will readily understand. Such modifications and variations are considered to be within the purview and scope of the invention and appended claims.
