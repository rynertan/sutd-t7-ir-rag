# Control apparatus for vehicle indicator lamps.

## Abstract
Apparatus for controlling a vehicle indicator lamp system in which indicator lamps are energized by a battery 17 via a current detecting resistor 8 , a relay 7 and a direction selecting switch 9 . The relay 7 is energized to close periodically in response to periodic pulses produced by a semicon ductor integrated control circuit so that the indicator lamps flash periodically. A protection circuit 6 which is connected in series with a resistor 101 across the bat tery render the output transistor 81 of the semiconductor integrated control circuit ON in response to an exces sively large positive voltage so that the electric current which flows through the output transistor 81 is limited by the inherent resistance of the relay coil 7a connected in series with the output transistor 81 . A diode 84 which is connected in series with the relay coil 7a renders the output transistor 81 ON reversely in re sponse to an excessively large negative voltage so that the electric current is limited by the relay coil.
