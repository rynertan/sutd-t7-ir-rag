## Description
Titanium trichloride catalyst and process for production of a olefin copolymers This invention relates to a catalyst containing titanium trichloride and to a process for the production of highly crystalline olefin polymers using this catalyst.As is well known in the art, crystalline olefin polymers are produced by polymerizing olefins in the presence of a so called Ziegler Natta catalyst comprising a compound of a transition metal of Groups IV to VI of the periodic table and a metal of Groups I to III of the periodic table or an organo compound of a metal of Groups I to III of the periodic table.In industrially producing polymers of such olefins as propylene or butene 1, a titanium trichloride composition is usually employed. In this method of production, however, amorphous polymers are formed as by products in addition to olefin polymers of high stereoregularity which are industrially very valuable.These amorphous polymers are of low industrial value, and adversely affect the mechanical properties of products formed from the olefin polymers, such as films and fibres.Moreover, the formation of such amorphous polymers leats to the loss of the monomeric starting material, and an additional means is required to remove the amorphous polymers. This is a very serious industrial disadvantage, and a method of substantial inhibition of the formation of amorphous polymers would be of great industrial advantage.Furthermore, in this method of production, the catalyst remains as a residue in the resulting olefin polymers, and adversely affects the stability and processability of the polymers. Additional equipment is necessary therefore to remove the residual catalyst and to stabilize the polymers.These disadvantages can be overcome by increasing the activity of the catalyst, which is expressed as the yield of olefin polymer per unit weight of catalyst. If the catalytic activity is increased, no equipment for the removal of the residual catalyst is necessary and the manufacturing cost of the olefin polymer can be reduced.Titanium trichloride is obtained, for example, by 1 reducing titanium tetrachloride with hydrogen and activating the reduction product by ball milling, 2 reducing titanium tetrachloride with metallic aluminum and activating the reduction product by ball milling, or 3 reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound at 300C to 300C and heating the resulting solid reduction product to 1200C to 1800C. The titanium trichloride as obtained bythe above described methods, however, is not sufficiently satisfactory in its catalytic activity and stereoregularity. Thus various improvements have been attempted.As an improved method for production of titanium trichloride according to method 2 as described above, JapanesePatent Applications OPI Nos. 81889 1976, 117787 1976 and 87997 1978 propose to treat TiCl3AA with iodine or bromine, or a hydrocarbon compound of iodine or bromine. The term ,OPI as used herein refers to a published unexaminedJapanese patent application. Furthermore, various methods to activate the reduction solid obtained by reduction of titanium tetrachloride with the organoaluminum compound in method 3 have been proposed, including a method in which the reduction solid is treated with a complexing agent and further reacted with titanium tetrachloride British Patents Nos. 1,391,067 and 1,391,068 , a method in which the reduction solid is treated with a mixture of a complexing agent and titanium tetrachloride or carbon tetrachloride Japanese PatentApplications OPI Nos. 34478 1972, 143790 1975, 30593 1976, 7891 1977 and 110793 1977 , a method in which the reduction solid is treated with a complexing agent and a chlorinated hydrocarbon compound Japanese Patent Applications OPI Nos. 107294 1977 and 14192 1978 , a method in which a or y type titanium trichloride is pulverized and treated with a complexing agent and further with an interhalogen compound Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 155199 1977 , and a method in which the reduction solid is treated with a complexing agent, titanium tetrachloride and a chlorinated hydrocarbon compound Japanese Patent Application OPI No.65286 1978 .The inventors also have already proposed a method of reacting a titanium trichloride composition with a mixture of an ether compound and a halogen or a halogen containing compound see U.S. Patent No. 4,165,298 and U.K. Patent No.1,599,447 .These methods, however, fail to adequately improve the activity of the catalyst and stereoregularity of the polymer.Extensive studies have been made on the production of a solid titanium tetrachloride catalyst which has greatly improved catalytic activity and permits to produce crystalline olefin polymers having improved stereoregularity as compared to those disclosed in the prior art references cited hereinabove, and have led to the discovery that a solid titanium trichloride catalyst obtained by reacting a titanium trichloride composition with a halogen compound, an ether compound and an electron donor is unexpectedly greatly improved in catalytic activity and particularly in stereoregularity as compared to the titanium trichloride composition prior to the reaction and to those solid titanium trichloride catalysts obtained by reacting the titanium trichloride composition with the two components of the halogen compound and the ether compound, or with the two components of the halogen compound and the electron donor.This invention, therefore, provides a process for the production of an a olefin polymer which comprises polymerizing or copolymerizing an a olefin in the presence of a catalyst system comprising A a solid titanium trichloride catalyst component obtained by reacting 1 the titanium trichloride composition represented by the general formula TiCl R1 AlX E 3 n 3 n p q wherein R1 is a hydrocarbon radical containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms, X is a halogen atom, E is an ether compound, and n, 2 and q are each a number satisfying the equations 0 t n 2, 0 p 1 and 0 q 1, with a mixture of 2 at least one halogen compound selected from the following a , b and c a a halogen represented by the general formula X2 wherein X is Cl, Br or I b an interhalogen compound represented by the general formula XX a wherein X and X ar each Cl, Br or I, a is 1 or 3 and X and X are different and c a halogen containing hydrocarbon compound containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms 3 an ether compound represented by the general formula R2 0 R3 wherein R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, are each an alkyl group containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms and 4 an electron donor excluding the ether compound 3 above and B an activator represented by the general formula R4mAlY3 m m 3 m wherein R4 is a hydrocarbon radical containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms, Y is a halogen atom or a hydrogen atom, and m is a number satisfying the equation 2 m 3.

In this case, therefore, care must be taken in the order of adding the catalytic components.The polymerization of an olefin can be carried out over the temperature range of 300 to 2000C. However, at lower temperatures than 00C, the rate of polymerization decreases whereas at higher temperatures than 1000C, no polymers of high stereoregularity can be obtained. Usually, therefore, the reaction is performed in the range of Oo to 1000C.While the polymerization pressure is not critical, a pressure of 3 to 100 atmospheres is desirable from the industrial and economic standpoints.The polymerization can be performed either in a continuous or batchwise manner.a Olefins which can be used in this invention are those containing 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as ethylene, propylene, butene 1, pentene 1, 4 methylpentene 1 or hexene 1.The olefin polymerization can be either homopolymerization or copolymerization.In copolymerization, two or more a olefins are mixed and contacted with the catalyst system to form copolymers. In order to obtain highly stereoregular copolymers, the mixing ratio of two a olefins is desirably such that the proportion of one of the olefins is not more than 10 mole. Heteroblock copolymerization in two or more stages can also be easily performed. Suitable methods of polymerization include slurry polymerization in which an inert hydrocarbon solvent such as butane, pentane, hexane, heptane or octane is used, polymerization in the liquified monomer using no solvent, and gas phase polymerization in a gaseous monomer.The following Examples and Comparative Examples are given to illustrate this invention in greater detail.Example 1Method 1 Preparation of Solid Titanium Trichloride CatalystA 200 ml flask equipped with a stirrer was purged with argon and then charged with 10.0 g of TC1 AA TAC 131 produced by Toho Titanium Co., Ltd. , 80 ml of toluene, 1.15 g of iodine, 11.0 ml of di n butyl ether and 1.o ml of tri n butyl phosphate.
