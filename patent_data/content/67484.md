# Stable colloidal dispersions of triacontanol.

## Abstract
Stable colloidal dispersions of 1 triacontanol in water are disclosed. The dispersions are capable of more consis tently stimulating plant growth by allowing for the uniform application of a large number of very small crystalline triacontanol particles. The dispersions preferably also con tain an anionic, cationic, zwitterionic or polyfunctional single bond nonionic surfactant dispersing agent.
