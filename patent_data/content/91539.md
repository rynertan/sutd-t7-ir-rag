# Gene coding for interleukin 2 polypeptide, recombinant DNA carrying said gene, cell lines possessing the recombinant DNA,and method for producing interleukin 2 using said cells.

## Abstract
A gene coded for a polypeptide which possesses interleukin 2 activity is isolated, and connected with a vector DNA which is capable of replicating in a procaryotic or eucaryotic cell at a position downstream of a promoter gene in the vector obtaining a recombinant DNA, with which the cell is transformed to produce interleukin 2.
