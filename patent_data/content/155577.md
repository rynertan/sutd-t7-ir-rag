# Process for recovering subterranean stem starch and protein.

## Abstract
This invention provides a process for easily recovering nearly white starch and protein having a high commercial value by depressing darkening of crushed slurry and juice in producing starch and protein of a subterranean stem. The above mentioned process is characterized by adding at least one member selected from the group consisting of sodium thiosulfate, potassium thiosulfate, sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium sulfite and potassium sulfite at the time of crushing the subterranean stem.
