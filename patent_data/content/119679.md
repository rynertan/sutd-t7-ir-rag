# Optical determination of clearances.

## Abstract
Simplification in manufacture and use of an optical triangulation probe is achieved by providing it with a T shaped optical path. The cross bar of the T shape extends between a light source comprising a laser diode 42 and a light detector comprising a photodiode array 103, whilst the stem of the T shape contains a rod shaped lens and prism arrangement 71. The cross bar of the T shape is occupied by a solid optical bar shaped assembly 31 comprising a number of blocks cemented together and providing reflec tive surfaces 53,55 and 59 for directing outgoing and return light through the T shape, The lens and prism arrangement focusses outgoing light from laser diode 42 onto the surface of an object 101 whose distance is to be measured and fo cusses reflected return light onto the photodiode array 103 as a light spot 111. Position of light spot 111 as monitored by the output signal of photodiode array 103 is a measure of distance D between the object 101 and the probe. The probe is for use in gas turbines for measuring clearances between rotor blade tips and turbine casings.
