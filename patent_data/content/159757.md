## Description
This invention relates generally to differential amplifiers suitable for operational amplifiers made in semiconductor integrated circuit form and especially to differential amplifiers employing pairs of transistors to achieve rail to rail input capability. In particular this invention relates to an amplifier operable between first and second supply voltages which define a supply range consisting of a a first end range extending from the first supply voltage to a first specified voltage between the supply voltages, b a middle range extending from the first specified voltage to a second specified voltage between the first specified voltage and the second supply voltage, and c a second end range extending from the second specified voltage to the second supply voltage, the amplifier having first differential means for amplifying a differential input signal by largely dividing a first operating current into first and second internal currents whose difference is representative of the input signal when its common mode voltage varies across the middle and second ranges second differential means for amplifying the input signal by largely dividing a second operating current into third and fourth internal currents whose difference is representative of the input signal when the common mode voltage varies across the first and middle ranges and summing means for selectively combining the internal currents to generate at least one output signal. Such an amplifier is known from the Japanese patent application no. 45706 84. It is often desirable that an operational amplifier op amp utilize a low power supply voltage. This severely constrains the voltage range of the common mode part of the differential input signal supplied to many prior art bipolar op amps, particularly those whose input stage is a differential amplifier. In many cases, the common mode voltage V In the known amplifier the V This amplifier has a differential input section containing complementary differential portions 10 and 12 which amplify the differential input signal defined by voltages V The input section is connected to a summing circuit 18 containing transistors QA, QB, QC, and QD configured as shown in Fig. 1. Equal valued resistors RA, RB, RC, and RD are also part of circuit 18. As described more fully in the foregoing patent application, circuit 18 is a modulated current mirror for combining signal currents from differential portions 10 and 12 to provide an output current I The range for the power supply voltage V Differential portion 10 contains NPN transistors Q1 and Q2 which amplify the input signal by dividing operating current provided from current source 14 on interconnected lines SA and SB into respective currents I Similarly, differential portion 12 has PNP transistors Q3 and Q4 which divide operating current provided from current source 16 on interconnected lines SC and SD into respective currents I A measure of the amplification capability of a differential amplifier is its transconductance G While the rail to rail input capability of the foregoing amplifier is advantageous, the G According to the invention, an amplifier for amplifying a differential input signal has rail to rail input capability with a transconductance that can be controlled as the common mode voltage of the input signal varies across the power supply range. When, for example, the differential portions are embodied in bipolar technology, the current control optimally maintains the sum of the operating currents largely constant as the common mode voltage varies across the rail to rail range. This enables the amplifier transconductance to be largely constant. This facilitates optimization of the frequency response by enabling the loop gain to be largely constant when the amplifier is used with a negative feedback network and reduces signal distortion in negative feedback applications. The basic technique involves diverting at least part of the supply current away from the supply lines for one of the differential portions as the common mode voltage goes into the end range where the input transistors in that differential portion are non conductive. This is preferably done with one or more steering transistors differentially configured with respect to one or both pairs of input transistors. The supply lines for the other differential portion are then provided with current derived from the current diverted away. As a result, the portion of the current control that provides the supply current normally does not partially shut down. The configuration of the amplifier is quite simple. It typically uses just a few more transistors than the prior are device described above. Consequently, the present amplifier is especially suited for use as an op amp input stage in low power supply applications. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Like reference symbols are employed to identify the same or very similar item or items in the drawings and description of the preferred embodiments. Referring to the drawings, Fig. 2 shows a general differential amplifier having rail to rail input capability with controlled transconductance. This amplifier has a differential input section consisting of a pair of differential input portions 20 and 22 that commonly receive the differential input signal formed by voltages V Differential portion 20 contains identical like polarity input transistors Q1 and Q2, while differential portion 22 contains identical like polarity input transistors Q3 and Q4. Although transistors Q1 Q4 are shown as bipolar transistors, they may be field effect transistors FET s of the insulated gate or junction type. Transistors Q3 and Q4 are typically complementary to transistors Q1 and Q2, particularly if the amplifier is embodied in bipolar or CMOS technology. Transistors Q1 Q4 may, however, all be of the same polarity in some circumstances. For example, transistors Q1 and Q2 could be depletion mode FET s, while transistors Q3 and Q4 are enhancement mode FET s. A transistor such as any of transistors Q1 Q4 or the other transistors described below has a first flow electrode, a second flow electrode, and a control electrode for regulating current transmission between the flow electrodes. For a bipolar transistor its base, emitter, and collector are respectively the control, first, and second electrodes. These are the gate, source, and drain for an FET. Transistors Q1 Q4 are all turned on when V Responsive to the input signal differentially supplied to their control electrodes, transistors Q1 and Q2 jointly control current flow between supply and internal lines SA and LA and between supply and internal lines SB and LB. Lines SA and SB are connected together to carry an operating current I Responsive to the input signal differentially supplied to their control electrodes, transistors Q3 and Q4 jointly control current flow between supply and internal lines SC and LC and between supply and internal lines SD and LD. Lines SC and SD are similarly connected together to carry an operating current Ip for portion 22. It amplifies the input signal by largely dividing operating current Ip into internal currents I For purpose of illustration, the direction of current flow for currents I Summing circuit 26 receives the currents on internal lines LA LD at respective nodes A, B, C and D and suitably combines these currents to generate one or more output currents. Complementary output currents I Current control 24 provides amplifier supply current that is utilized in generating operating currents I Current control 24 which is connected to portion 20 by way of lines SA and SB and to portion 22 by way of lines SC and SD controls the transconductance of the amplifier by regulating operating currents I Fig. 3a shows an embodiment of Fig. 2 in which transistors Q1 and Q2 are NPN transistors whose bases receive the input signal, whose emitters are respectively connected to lines SA and SB to receive current I Control 24 in Fig. 3a consists of current source 16 that provides the amplifier supply current at constant level I Mirror 28 contains identical NPN transistors Q5 and Q6 whose bases are connected to the Q5 collector which is connected through a steering line LN to the QP collector. The Q6 collector is connected to lines SA and SB. The emitters of transistors Q5 and Q6 are coupled through respective equal valued resistors R1 and R2 to the V The current flow through transistor QP is in the wrong direction for providing current by way of lines SA and SB to transistors Q1 and Q2. Mirror 28 largely mirrors duplicates the current on line LN at the Q5 collector and provides the mirrored current at the Q6 collector in the right direction for transistors Q1 and Q2. Fig. 3b shows a graph helpful in understanding the operation of control 24 in Fig. 3a. Voltage V In the following discussion for this embodiment as well as the similar discussions below of other embodiments, base currents are ignored in comparison to collector or emitter currents. To the extent that base currents are involved, indicated equalities mean that items indicated as being equal are only largely equal. In addition, the various graphs only show asymptotes for the variation of currents I In the low V As V When V As shown m Fig. 3b, the sum of currents I Summing circuit 26 in Fig. 3a contains a modulated current mirror 30 consisting of transistors Q7, Q8, Q9, and Q10, an identical modulated current mirror 32 consisting of transistors Q11, Q12, Q13, and Q14, and equal valued resistors RA RD and R3, R4, R5, and R6 connected as shown to provide complementary currents I Fig. 4a depicts a partial embodiment of the present amplifier in which portions 20 and 22 are configured the same as in Fig. 3a. The principal difference is in current control 24 where current sources 14 and 16 provide supply currents at constant levels I Control 24 in Fig. 4a contains transistor QP and mirror 28 configured the same as in Fig. 3a except that anti noise resistors R1 and R2 are omitted in Fig. 4a. Control 24 further includes a current mirror 34 and an NPN steering transistor QN. Reference voltage V Fig. 4b shows a graph that facilitates understanding the operation of control 24 in Fig. 4a. Voltages V In the low V As V In the central middle range portion extending from V In the upper middle range portion extending from V The sum of currents I Fig. 5a shows an embodiment of the present amplifier in which portion 20 is configured the same as in Fig. 4a, but portion 22 is configured differently. Portion 22 in Fig. 5a contains a level shifter that translates the input signal into a shifted differential signal whose common mode voltage is at least 1V The direction of current flow in lines LA and LB relative to portion 20 is the same as the direction of current flow in lines LC and LD relative to portion 22. Accordingly, a double ended summing circuit is achieved by simply connecting lines LA and LC together to provide output I Control 24 in Fig. 5a consists of current source 14 and NPN steering transistor QN whose base receives voltage V Fig. 5b shows a graph helpful in understanding the operation of control 24 in Fig. 5a. Voltage V The sum of currents I Fig. 6 illustrates a preferred embodiment of the amplifier of Fig. 2 in which portions 20 and 22 and control 24 are configured as in Fig. 3a except that the input signal is supplied through resistors R9 and R10 to portions 20 and 22. Current source 16 consists of a PNP transistor QS and a resistor RS connected as shown. Summing circuit 26 in Fig. 6 contains PNP transistors QA and QB and NPN transistors QC and QD connected as shown in Fig. 1 except that the bases of transistors QC and QD receive a bias voltage V Circuit 26 in Fig. 6 operates as follows. As seen from line LA, resistor RA is a high impedance whereas transistor QA is a low impedance. The same holds for lines LB LD with respect to resistors RB RD and transistors QB QD. When incremental currents ŒîI A set of Schottky diodes D1, D2, D3 and D4 in combination with resistors R9 and R10 prevents the polarities of outputs I A pair of PN diodes D5 and D6 in combination with resistors R9 and R10 prevent large Zener currents from detrimentally affecting transistors Q1 Q4 when the differential part 2 ŒîV of the input signal becomes too large. Diodes D5 and D6 are connected in parallel in opposing directions between resistors R9 and R10. Each of diodes D5 and D6 is preferably an NPN transistor having its base connected to its collector. In Fig. 6, voltages V In portions 20 and 22, as for example, embodied in Figs. 3a 5a or 6, each pair of corresponding transistors such as transistors Q1 and Q2 may be replaced with a pair of groups of transistors arranged in identical voltage following configurations. Such a bipolar group typically consists of a lead transistor whose emitter is coupled directly or through one or more other transistors to the base of a trailing transistor. The input signal to the group is supplied to the base of the leading transistor to control current flow between lines connected to the emitter and collector of the trailing transistor. If a pair of corresponding transistors in portion 20 or 22 is in a differential configuration with a steering transistor in control 24, that transistor may also be replaced with a group of transistors arranged in a corresponding voltage following configuration. Fig. 7 illustrates how this replacement can be done in the embodiment of Fig. 5a. As indicated in Fig. 7, transistor Q1 is replaced with a Darlington transistor pair in which the emitter of transistor Q1 is connected to the base of an NPN transistor Q21 whose emitter and collector are respectively connected to lines SA and LA. Voltage V Because Darlingtons are used in portions 20 and 22 in Fig. 7, V The present amplifier may be embodied partly or wholly with FET s, Fig. 8a depicts a partial embodiment similar to that of Fig. 4a but using CMOS technology. All the transistors in Fig. 8a are preferably enhancement mode MOS FET s, Each N channel FET is indicated by an arrow on its source pointing away from the FET. Each P channel FET is indicated by an arrow on its source pointing toward the FET. The input section in Fig. 8a contains portions 20 and 22 interconnected with control 24 in the same way as the corresponding items are interconnected in Fig. 4a. Mirror 28 of Fig. 4a is replaced with a reversing circuit 42 in which a resistor RN is connected between the Q5 source and the V Fig. 8b shows a graph that facilitates understanding the operation of control 24 in Fig. 8a. The operation is generally the same as that of Fig. 4a. The V The transconductance for a MOS FET is approximately proportional to the square root of its drain current. If circuits 42 and 44 were simply current mirrors that provided no current amplification, G Furthermore, one or both of circuits 42 and 44 can be configured to give current reduction rather than amplification. G The foregoing comments concerning transconductance regulation apply to other FET embodiments of the present invention as well as to bipolar embodiments. Within certain limits, connecting a suitable current reversing circuit between line LN and lines SA and SB if current source 16 is used and or connecting a suitable current reversing circuit between line LP and lines SC and SD if current source 14 is used allow G Methods for manufacturing the various elements of the present amplifier are well known in the semiconductor art.
