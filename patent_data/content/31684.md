# Solutions of bromoxynil and ioxynil esters.

## Abstract
Solutions containing high concentrations of the n butyric acid ester and n octanoic acid ester of bromoxynil 3,5 dibro mo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile or ioxynil 3,5 diiodo 4 hydroxy benzonitrile . Such solutions have crystallization temperatures lower than those of like solutions containing like amounts of any one of such esters alone. Bromoxynil and ioxynil are well known herbicides for an nual broadleaf weeds.
