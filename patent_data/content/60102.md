# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO DIFFERENTIAL GEARS

## Abstract
This invention relates to differential gears for mechani cally propelled vehicles, and it is an object of the invention to reduce spinning of one wheel or axle of a vehicle in icy or muddy conditions. This result is achieved by feeding oil through passages in the sun gear to the meshing teeth of the sun gear and the planet wheels. Thus, if one wheel or axle starts to spin, there will be relative rotation between the sun gear and the planet wheels which will then act like a gear pump. The sun gear and the planet wheels are located in a relatively confined space so that the rate at which the oil can be dissipated is limited. The load caused by the oil pumping limits rotation between the sun gear and the planet wheels, and enables torque to be applied to the slipping wheel or axle.
