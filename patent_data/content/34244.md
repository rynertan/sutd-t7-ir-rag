# NON DESTRUCTIVE READ OUT ONE FET CELL MEMORY MATRIX

## Abstract
A non destructive read out memory cell system is pro vided having a semiconductor substrate 10 supporting an array of memory cells 34 each of which includes a field effect transistor having a source 22B and a drain 18A defining a channel region having high and low threshold sections. In a first embodiment the channel region is further defined by the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate, and in second and third embodiments the channel region is further defined by a V groove 12 and by a U groove, respectively, formed in the substrate. A gate electrode separated from the surface of the semiconductor substrate by a thin insulating layer 24 is disposed over the channel region. A storage node 16A , pref erably an N diffusion region, is located within the substrate adjacent to the high threshold section of the channel region. Pulsing means 30,32 are provided for selectively charging and discharging the storage node and sensing means 32 are provided to determine the flow of current passing through the channel region, which is representative of the binary informa tion contained on the storage node.
