# An X ray generator device.

## Abstract
In an X ray generator device a target member 11 emitting X rays by electron bombardment is arranged in a rod shaped tubular probe 6 and is provided with a conically tapering front part 12 facing a comparatively narrow aperture 10 in a controlling electron beam diaphragm 9 for the purpose of forming a substantially punctiform radiation source. The position of the target member 11 is adjusted by securing the rod shaped target member 11 for a part of its length reckoned from its opposite, rearmost end in a central bore 13 of an oblong cylindrical target carrier 14 positioned coaxially in the probe 6 , said target carrier being only at its foremost end connected with the wall of the probe 6 , thereby allowing fine adjustment of the target member 11 with respect to said aperture 10 by displacement of said opposite end of the target carrier 14 in a radial plane in the probe 6 , e.g. by means of wedge means formed as adjusting screws in the annular channel 16 between the target carrier 14 and the inner wall of the probe 6 .
