# Crosslinkable polymer composition and its use in cathodic deposition applications.

## Abstract
A composition of matter is provided, which comprises certain polydiene functionalized epoxy amine adduct and certain polydieneophile functionalized polyisocyanate oligomer, which epoxy amine adduct and polyisocyanate oligomer are co reactive at elevated cure temperature. The polydiene functionalized epoxy amine adduct comprises the reaction product of certain polyhydroxy functional epoxy amine reactant with diene functional mono isocyanate reactant. The polydieneophile functionalized polyisocyanate oligomer comprises the reaction product of polyisocyanate reactant, preferably a triisocyanate, with approximately equal molar equivalent amount of monohydroxy dieneophile reactant or monoamino dieneophile reactant or like isocyanate reactive dieneophile reactant. The cross linkable composition of matter is useful in coating and other applications, especially cathodic electrocoating applications.
