# Data storage subsystem comprising a pair of control units and method for the automatic recovery of data from a defaulting one of these control units.

## Abstract
A storage subsystem comprises a pair of control units 21,23 coupling a plurality of channels 5,7,9 to a plurality of data storage device 27,29 . Each control unit includes a plurality of registers 351, 352 for storing error check and status data. A communications link 31 couples the register sets together. When a fault condition is discovered in one of the control units, an unavilability signal is sent to the opera tively coupled channel and an alert signal, through link 31, to the other control unit for storage in one of the registers. When this registers is addressed in a polling operation, said other control unit allows transfer of the register data to its own registers. Meanwhile, a selective reset reply from the channel is buffered until the register data has been transferred to prevent erasure of this data before transfer.
