## Description
TitleApparatus For Driving Electrochromic Displaying DeviceField of the Invention The present invention relates to an apparatus for driving electrochromic displaying device, and more particularly to an apparatus for for effecting write in and erasing of display of the electrochromic display device.Background of the Invention An electrochromic display device referred to asECD is composed of a plurality of display electrodes coated with electrochromic material referred to as EC material , a common electrode disposed commonly to oppose the display electrodes and electrolyte filled in the space between the display electrodes and the common electrode. With this arrangement, each of the display electrodes is illuminated with a predetermined color UPOII application of a predetermined voltage of predetermined polarity to the display electrodes and the common electrode. The color once illuminated is kept unchanged even if the electric power source is removed from the display electrodes and the common electrode. The illuminated color can be erased by application of the voltage of reversed polarity to the respective electrodes.As mentioned above, the ECD can illuminate write in with a color and the illumination of color can be erased corresponding to the polarity of the applied voltage, in addition the ECD has an ability of memorization of display since the color once illuminated can be kept even if the power supply is removed from the ECD, therefore the EC devices are highly appreciated as power saving display equipments. In order to display numeric characters using ECD, a plurality of display electrodes are disposed in generally 8 character shape and a common electrode is disposed opposing to the display electrodes. When writing in theECD, one or more of the display electrodes are selectively grounded corresponding to the character to be displayed and the common electrode is supplied with a positive drive voltage so that said selected display electrodes are illuminated with a predetermined color, whereby the ECD displays the desired character. Fig. 1 shows an example of a circuit diagram of a conventional driving device of ECD, wherein ECD 1 comprises a plurality of display electrodes lal, la2. . lan and a common electrode ib opposing to the display electrodes. The respective display electrodes lal, la2... are grounded through switches 31 32 3n and are connected to a power supply VE for erasure through switches 21, .2 and n terminals 61, 62,.. 6n The common electrode ib is connected with a power supply Vw for writing in through switches 4 and terminal 7 and is grounded through a switch 5. The power supplies VE and Vw have the same polarity and voltage. The voltage of the power supplies VE and VW may be different. In order to write in the display electrode lal with the the la2 through lan kept unilluminated, the switch 4 is turned on and the switch 5 is turned off so as to apply the voltage Vw to the common electrode ib. The switch is turned of and the switch 31 is turned on so as to ground the display electrode lal, whereby a predetermined voltage is supplied across the common electrode lb and display electrode lal, thus, the display electrode lal is illuminated with a predetermined color. It is noted that the display electrode lal is driven by the voltage of Vw relative to the common electrode ib by negiecting the impedance of the switches, therefore the voltage Vw is defined by a value necessary to write in the display electrode.On the contrary, the switches 22... 2n and 32...3n are kept turned off, so that the display electrodes la2...lan are cut from the power supply, thus no voltage is applied to the display electrodes la2 through lan, then the non selected display electrodes are not illuminated. The write in the ECD can be performed such a manner as described above, when the write in operation is completed, the switches 3 and 4 are turned off, the color on the display electrode lal can be kept displayed. In order to erase the illumination of the color on the display electrode lal, the switch 5 is turned on to ground the common electrode lb, on the other hand, the switches 2 22f 2n are turned on so as to supply the voltage VE to the display electrodes lal through lan, whereby the voltage with the reversed polarity against the polarity at the time of write in operation is supplied. It is noted that the voltage of VE is supplied to the display electrodes lal, 1a2 through lan relative to the common electrode 1b by neglecting the impendance cf the switches, therefore, the value VE is defined by the necessary voltage for erasure of display. Thus the color on the display electrode lal is erased. As mentioned above, write in, erasure and memorization are performed. In the conventional arrangement described above, non selected electrodes are cut rom the power supply by opening the respective switches for preventing the non selected electrodes from being colored, however, since bipolar transistors cr MOSFETs are used as the switches, the impendance is not infinitive but has a limited value even if the switches are turned off. Therefore, even if the switches 22...2n and 32...3n are turned off for making the display electrodes la2 through lan to be cut from the power supply, the display electrodes la...lan are connected to the ground through a high impendance of the switches 3 3n whereby the non selected display electrodes are slightly colored. Cn the other hand, in case of erasing the color on the display electrode, the color can not be completely erased, in other words, the display electrode remains slightly colored. Specifically, the selected display electrode is colored by charging the common electrode and the selected display electrode and the color on the selected display electrode is erased by discharging. For example, when the switch 2l is turned on, the switch 3l is turned off so as to cause the discharying current to flow from the selected display electrode through the terminal 61, switch 2, display electrode lal, a coIz on electrode 1b and switch 5.However, the amount of the discharging current is slightly decreased by the current flowing through the switch whereby the selected electrode can not be fully discharged, so that the selected display electrode remains slightly colored. This light color remains on the display electrode if the display electrode is not selected for illumination in the subsequent process. Such residual color on the non selected display electrode will be reterred to as cross color. The cross color lowers the contrast of the display harming the quality of the display.Summary of the invention An essential object cf the present invention is to provide an apparatus for driving an electrochromic display device which enables to improve the contrast and quality of display. Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for driving an electrochromic display device which enables to prevent occurrence of cross color on the non selected display electrodes. According to the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for driving an electrochromic display device having a plurality of display electrodes on which electrochromic material is provided and a common electrode opposing commonly to each of the display electrodes, comprising means for selectively applying a write in voltage of a predetermined polarity across selected one or more display electrodes and the common electrode for a predetermined period of time so as to effect illuminating color on the selected one or more display electrodes and then or applying an erasure voltage cf a polarity opposite to that of said write in voltage across said selected one or more display electrodes and the common electrode for a period of time sufficient to effect the erasure of color on the selected one or more display electrodes, wherein an improvement which comprises means for applying a suppress voltage of a polarity opposite to that of said write in voltage across each of non selected display electrodes and the common electrode when the write in voltage is applied across the selected display electrodes and the common electrode so as to prevent illumination of color on the non selected display electrodes.Brief Explanation of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a schematic circuit diagram showing one example of a conventional circuit arrangement for driving an electrochromic display device, and Fig. 2 is a schematic circuit diagram showing a preferred embodiment of the driving circuit arrangement for the electrochromic display device according to the present invention, and Fig. 3 is a schematic circuit diagram showing a further embodiment of the driving circuit arrangement for the electrochromic display device according to the present invention.Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment Before the description proceeds, it is noted that like parts are designated by like reference numerals. Referring to Fig. 2, the terminals 6 , 6 and are applied with the voltage of VE V and the switch 5 is applied with the voltage V through a terminal 8. Vw is the voltage necessary for writing in the ECD 1 and VE is the voltage necessary for erasing the illumination of ECD 1. A control device 10 is provided for operation of the switches 2l through 2n, 3l through 3n, 4 and 5 in a manner as described hereinafter for illumination and erasure of the ECD 1. Assuming that the display electrode lal is selected for display and the display electrodes 1G2 through lan are non selected electrodes, in order to write in theECD 1, the switch 4 is turned on, the switch 5, switch are turned off and the switch 31 is turned on. The voltageVal supplied to the display electrode lal is represented as Val Vw l by taking the potential of the common electrode lb as the reference voltage. Thus, the display electrode lal is colored or write in operation is effected. With respect to the non selected display electrodes, when the display electrode ian is taken for example, the switch 2n is turned on and the switch 3n is turned off. As the result, the voltage Van is represented as Van VE V Vw 2 by taking the potential of the common electrode ib as the reference voltage. By taking the voltage V in such a value that Van is greater than 0, the non selected display electrode is applied with the voltage having the polarity of erasure i,e., the reversed polarity of the write in voltage. In a specific case, by taking V Vw, from the equation 2 , Van VE which is the voltage for erasure can be supplied to the display electrode lan. By this arrangement, since the erasure voltage is supplied to each of the non selected display electrode, the color on the non selected display electrodes can be effectively erased, thereby preventing cross color on the non selected display electrodes, resulting in obtaining a display of a high quality. In order to erase the color memorized on the selected display electrode lal, the switch 4 is turned off with the switch 5 turned on and the switches 2l, 22...2n are turned on with the switches 31 32 ..... turned off. By this operation, the voltage supplied on the display electrodes lal, la2, ... ian is represented by VE V V VE by taking the potential on the comrlor. electrode ib as the preference voltage, whereby the voltage for erase can be supplied tc the display electrodes. In a case where the erase on the non selected display electrodes can be made in such a degree that cross color does not occur or is negligible, the voltage V can be defined as Van 0. In this case, no write in current is supplied to the non selected display electrodes at the time of write in operation, whereby cross color does not occur.By selecting the voltage VE to be greater than or equal to the voltage Vw, the switch 5 can be connected to the ground as shown in Fig. 1, thereby enabling to omit the power supply for the voltage V. Fig. 3 shows another embodiment of the present invention in which each of the switches 31 32,...3n is connected with the negative terminal of the power source Vw ,the positive terminal of which is grounded. Each of the switches 21, 22,...2n is connected with the positive terminal of the power source VE. the negative terminal of which is grounded. In this embodiment, the switches 4 and 5 in the embodiment of Fig. 2 are omitted and a switch 11 is connected between the common electrode lb and the ground. The switch 11 is turned on during the write in period and the erasure period by the output of the control device 10.In this embodiment, in order to write in the display electrode lal, the switches 31 and 11 are turned on, so that the write in voltage Vw is applied across the common electrode lb and the display electrode lal with the display electrode lal to be negative. On the other hand the nor.selected display electrodes la2 through lan are applied with the erasure voltage VE through the switches 22 through 2n which are in on state, whereby the display electrode lal can be illuminated with color and the non selected display electrodes la2 through lan are prevented from being colored. For erasure of the color on the display electrode lal, for example, the switches 2 and 11 are turned on with the switch 31 turned off, whereby the display electrode lal is applied with the erasure voltage VE. When the writ ir. operation or erasure operation is completed the switch 11 is turned off. A similar operation can be made for the other display electrodes la2 through lan by operating the switches 2 through 2n, 31 through 3n and 11 under the operation of the control device 10 as described above.
