# An ignition system for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An ignition system for an internal combustion engine that provides automatically advanced timing over a predeter mined range of engine speeds. The ignition system includes a timing circuit 100 that controls the resistance and hence voltage across a capacitor 53 that biases a switch in the trigger circuit 50 of the system. The transistor 125 is operated in its active region so that the transistor 125 operates as a variable resistor. As the resistance of the transistor 125 decreases with increasing engine speed the timing of the system advances. The predetermined speed at which the advance begins is determined by zener diode 119 in series with the base of the transistor 125 . The maximum advance of the system is limited by a resistor 94 in series between the transistor 125 and the capacitor 53 of the trigger circuit 50 . The transistor 125 is operated in its active region by a transistorized circuit that receives its power from the main storage capacitor 27 of the ignition system.
