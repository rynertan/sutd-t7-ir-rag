# Pyridinyl substituted benz imidazole derivatives and preparation.

## Abstract
2 R 5 Py Y 1H benzimidazole or pharmaceutically ac ceptable acid addition salt thereof, useful as a cardotonic, is prepared by reacting 4 Py Y 1,2 benzenediamine with a tri lower alkyl ortho lower alkanoate of the formula R C OR₁ ₃, where R is hydrogen or lower alkyl, Y is a direct linkage or lower alkylene having one or two carbon atoms, and Py is 4 or 3 pyridinyl or 4 or 3 pyridinyl having one or two lo wer alkyl substituents, or with dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal or dimethylacetamide dimethyl acetal to produce said 2 R 5 Py Y 1 H benzimidazole where R is methyl or ethyl re spectively. The same compound where R is lower alkyl is pre pared in two steps by first reacting 4 Py Y 1,2 benzenedia mine with an alkanoylating agent providing alkanoyl of the for mula R C O to produce N₂ R C O 4 Py Y 1,2 benze nediamine and heating the latter compound to produce said 2 R 5 Py Y 1H benzimidazole, where R is lower alkyl. Also shown is 1 hydroxy 2 R 6 Py Y 1H benzimidazole or phar maceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, useful as a cardiotonic and prepared by reacting 3 nitro N RCO 4 Py Y benzeneamine with hydrogen under catalytic hydrogen conditions.
