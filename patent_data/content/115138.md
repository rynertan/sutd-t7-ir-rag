## Description
REGENERATIVE PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF LINEAR POLYETHYLENEPOLYAMINES USING A SUPPORTED CATALYST BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical Field of the Invention This invention relates to a continuous process for the preparation of predominantly linear polyethylenepolyamines from ethylenediamine and monoethanolamine in the presence of unique thermally pelleted activated catalyst compositions having phosphorous deposited on a group IVb transition metal oxide and to the use of oxygen to regenerate the catalyst when it has become at least partially deactivated during the course of the reaction.Prior Art Heretofore, polyethylenepolyamine compounds such as diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine and the higher homologs have been produced by the reaction of an alkyl halide such as ethylene dichloride with an amine such as ammonia or ethylenediamine at elevated temperatures and pressures. Normally, relatively high yields of predominantly non cyclic polyethylenepolyamine compounds are obtained from this process with varying yields of heterocyclic amines. The large amounts of energy required to produce the reactants as well as the difficult separation procedures required to recover the more valuable linear polyethylenepolyamines diminish the usefulness of the ethylene dichloride process.The hydrohalide salts of ammonia and the polyethylenepolyamine products must also undergo difficult and time consuming caustic neutralization to yield the free polyethylenepolyamines. It has heretofore been known that phosphates can be used to catalyze reactions to produce predominantly heterocyclic rather than linear products. Thus, U.S.Patent No. 3,297,701 teaches the use of aluminum phosphate to catalyze the reaction of ethanolamines and polyethylenepolyamines to yield cyclic compounds. U.S.Patent No. 3,342,820 discloses the use of aluminum phosphate for the preparation of heterocyclic compounds such as triethylenediamine. As another example, U.S.Patent No. 4,103,087 also discloses the use of aluminum phosphate catalysts for producing heterocyclic product compounds. More recently, investigators have found that more linear products can also be obtained in a catalyst conversion. Thus, Ford et al. U.S. Patent No.4,316,840 discloses the preparation of polyalkylenepolyamines from ethylene diamine utilizing a metal nitrate or sulfate as a catalyst. U.S. Patent No.4,314,083 discloses the reaction of ethylenediamine with monoethanolamine to prepare noncyclic polyalkylenepolyamines using, as a catalyst, a salt of a nitrogen or sulfur containing compound. In inventions originating in our laboratories,Brennan et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,036,881 discloses the use of phosphorous containing catalysts to catalyze the reaction of ethylenediamine with monoethanolamine.Excellent results were obtained when the reaction was conducted in an autoclave. However, when the phosphorous compound was supported on silica or diatomaceous earth, good results were obtained only at comparatively low conversions. Brennan et al. U.S. Patent No.4,044,053 is also relevant in this regard. Copending application Serial No. 453,841 of Brennan filed December 27, 1982 is directed to an alumina phosphate type catalyst composition wherein the novel feature is the method of preparing a catalyst from alumina phosphoric acid, ammonium hydroxide and water. Excellent results were obtained using a catalyst of this nature in batchtype reactions. Brennan U.S. Patent No. 4,103,087 discloses the use of pelleted aluminum phosphate to prepare di N,N disubstituted amino alkanes. French Patent No. 1,317,359 dated February 8, 1963, discloses the preparation of granulated zirconium phosphate and its use as an ion exchange resin. Winkler et al. in a 1966 publication Deutsche Akad. Wiss.,Berlin, Germany, Z. Anorg. Allgen. Chem. 346 1 2 , 92112 1966 1 disclose compounds of the general formulaHXVP203 wherein X represents arsenic, antimony and mixtures thereof. Also disclosed are compounds of the general formula H2XiVP2O3, wherein X represents silicon, germanium, tin, lead, titanium and zirconium. It is shown that the group IV phosphates have cation exchange properties. Daniel Br. Apcn. 2,092,467 published August 18, 1982, modifies iron phosphate catalysts disclosed inCavaterra U.S. Patent 3,948,959 for making methacrylic acid from isobutyric acid. Daniel uses such catalysts in admixture with a support prepared by calcining the dried powder recovered from a slurry of silica with phosphoric acid. Daniel teaches that the support is inert and that titania or zirconia can also be used. Tawil et. al. U. S. Patent No. 4,025,608 is directed to the reaction of a zirconium salt with phosphoric acid or a phosphate to prepare granular zirconium phosphate for use as an ion exchanger. Zimmerschied et.al. U. S. Patent No. 2,921,081 discloses catalysts for use in the conversion of olefins that are prepared by reacting a zirconium halide with a designated class of phosphoric acids. Bates U. S. Patent No. 2,349,243 shows treatment of hydrocarbons with a zirconium phosphate prepared by reacting a phosphoric acid with a soluble salt of zirconium such as the nitrate, sulfate, chloride or oxychloride. Stynes et. al. in U. S.Patent No. 3,416,884 prepare crystalline zirconium phosphates by thermally treating zirconium phosphate with phosphoric acid to provide products that are useful as ion exchangers and catalysts. Dwyer et. al. U. S.Patent No. 3,130,147 is concerned with cracking hydrocarbons using an acidic catalyst comprising oxides of aluminum, zirconium and phosphorous prepared by reacting water soluble salts of aluminum and zirconium with certain oxyacids of phosphorous and the salts thereof. Inoue et. al. U. S. Patent No. 4,018,706 is directed to the purification of exhaust gases using a support containing an oxide complex of titanium, phosphorous and aluminum. The complex is prepared by mixing a water soluble titanium compound such as titanium tetrachloride or titanium sulfate with a water soluble phosphorous compound such as phosphoric acid. In Holm U.S. Patent No. 3,448,164 catalysts are disclosed that can contain titania and can be prepared, for example, by coprecipitating titanium metallates or a titanium oxide with aluminum phosphate. Rylander et. al. U. S.Patent No. 2, 824,073 is concerned with the manufacture of a titanium phosphoric acid catalyst that can be prepared by mixing titania with triphosphoric acid to form a doughy mixture which is thereafter dried and heated. A method of preparing novel catalyst compositions is disclosed. The catalyst is extremely useful in the improved production of predominantly linear polyethylenepolyamines from ethylenediamine and monoethanolamine.The novel phosphate catalysts of the claimed invention can be prepared by treating a group IVb metal oxide support with a phosphorous compound such that, in a thermally activated condition, the phosphorous is chemically bound to the support. These novel compositions can be used to catalyze the reaction of monoethanolamine with ethylenediamine to provide essentially linear polyethylenepolyamine reaction products. It has also been discovered that the novel catalyst compositions when at least partially deactivated in the continuous production of linear polyethylenepolyamine reaction products from monoethanolAmine and ethylenediamine can be regenerated by treatment with oxygen under controlled regeneration conditions. Although good results are obtained when the catalysts of the present invention are used to catalyze the reaction of monoethanolamine with ethylene diamine, it is to be remembered that the source of the phosphorous is important insofar as the stability, activity and selectivity of the catalyst is concerned. Table II B shows that the amount of phosphorous bonded to the titania and the strength of the resultant pellets varied from source to source. Table II A shows a similar variance with respect to activity and selectivity.Thus, for best results, it is necessary to correlate the source of the phosphorous with the steps and conditions employed in making the catalyst because different sources of phosphorous can lead to different and not always optimum results with respect to catalyst stability, activity and selectivity. DETAILED DESCRIPTION In one aspect the invention is directed to improved catalyst compositions comprising a group IVb metal oxide to which phosphorous has been chemically bonded by thermal activation. In another aspect the catalysts are used in producing essentially linear polyethylenepolyamines such as diethylenetriamine, triethylene tetramine, tetraehtylenepentamine and pentaethylene examine from the reaction of ethylenediamine and monoethanolamine. The inventor is unaware of the precise structural differences between the claimed catalysts and previous phosphate catalysts that have been tried in such reactions but it is cognizant of substantially higher rates of conversion to linear polyethylenepolyamines with the claimed catalysts. The novel catalyst compositions catalyze the reaction of ethylenediamine with monoethanolamine at a temperature of from about 2500C to about 4000C, preferably from about 3000C to about 350 C and a pressure of from about 500 34.47 bar gauge to about 3000 psig. 206.8 bar gauge and preferably from about 1000 68.9 bar gauge to about 2000 psig. 137.8 bar gauge .Higher temperatures and pressures can be used, if desired, but there is no particular advantage in using such higher temperatures and or pressures. The pelleted catalyst compositions of the present invention are normally employed as a fixed bed of catalyst in a continuous reaction system. In a continuous process of this nature, the time of contact of the reactants with the catalyst is one of the interrelated factors that those skilled in the art will adjust, along with temperature, pressure, bed geometry, pellet size, etc. in order to obtain a desired rate of reaction and, hence, a desired percentage of conversion of the reactants Thus, in a continuous process, it is not necessary to drive the reaction to completion because unreacted feedstock components can be recycled to the reactor. It is customary to use cylindrically shaped catalyst pellets having a diameter essentially equal to the length thereof, such as diameters and lengths ranging from about 0.794 mm 1 32 inch to about 9.525 mm 3 8 inch . It will be understood that the shape and dimensions of the pellets are not critical to the present invention and that pellets of any suitable shape and dimensions may be used as desired, by one wishing to practice the process of the present invention. When cylindrical pellets of catalyst of the type described above are used, the weighted hourly space velocity may be varied within wide limits e.g., 0.1 to 5 w hr w in order to obtain a desired rate of conversion, as explained above. Normally, space velocities of about 0.5 to 2 w hr w will be employed. Catalyst life is an important factor in conducting a continuous reaction. For example, if a catalyst is easily poisoned, or if catalyst pellets do not have good structural properties, the economics of the process will be seriously and adversely affected. The catalysts of the present invention are not particularly susceptible to poisoning so this normally does not present a problem. However, under the reaction conditions employed, amines of the type used and formed herein have the potential capability of leaching or otherwise adversely affecting the structural integrity of the pellets. In an extreme instance, catalyst pellets having good initial crush strength and surface hardness will be reduced to fines very rapidly when used under reaction conditions such as those employed herein. It is a feature of the present invention that the pelleted catalyst compositions have improved resistance to physical degradation when used to catalyze the reaction of monoethanolamine with ethylenediamine. As a consequence, the catalyst compositions of the present invention are advantageously used for a continuous process for the continuous production of essentially linear polyethylenepolyamine reaction products from monoethanolamine and ethylenediamine. As shown herein, such catalyst compositions can be used for prolonged periods without the need for regeneration. Thus, inExample IV it is shown that a representative catalyst of the present invention was used for over 2,000 hours with good results. Nevertheless, with the passage of time deactivation will tend to slowly occur. Deactivation can be measured qualitatively as the increase of temperature required to maintain an essentially constant conversion rate for the monoethanolamine and ethylenediamine. When a catalyst composition of the present invention has become deactivated, or at least partially deactivated, in the sense that the temperatures required to maintain a desired conversion level is considered to be excessive, the catalyst may be regenerated with ease with oxygen under controlled regeneration conditions. The minimum regeneration temperature is the temperature required, for the catalyst employed, both to burn impurities from the catalyst and to again thermally activate the catalyst. This can be determined experimentally see Example IV B and is normally in excess of 4000C e.g., 4500C . The maximum regeneration temperature is the temperature at which the catalyst employed is thermally deactivated. The better practice is to use a temperature well below the deactivation temperature range of about 7000C to 9000C e.g., 5500C . Pure oxygen can be used, but it is preferably used in a concentration of about 1 to 20 , the balance being an inert gas e.g. nitrogen, flue gas, etc . The catalyst bed is preferably preconditioned with a lean regeneration gas e.g., 1 3 oxygen for about 0.5 to 5 hours e.g., 1 2 hours . Thereafter the oxygen concentration in the regeneration gas can be progressively increased or increased in stages to a concentration of from about 3 to about 20 oxygen while adjusting the temperature, if desired, to a temperature within the range of about 450 to 550 C. The oxygen treatment may be continued in this fashion suitably for about 2 to 10 hours. Thereafter the catalyst bed is flushed with an inert gas until it is cooled and it may. then be restored to service. The catalyst compositions of the present invention are prepared by depositing a phosphorus compound on a support comprising an oxide of a group IVb transition metal oxide. The group IVb transition metal oxides include the oxides of titanium, zirconium, hafnium and thorium. Pellets of the group IVb metal oxide may be prepared by extrusion or by compaction in conventional pelleting apparatus using a pelleting aid such as graphite. It is also within the scope of the present invention to deposit the phosphorus compound on a powdered IVb metal oxide followed by pelleting and calcination. Any appropriate liquid or liquefiable phosphorus compound can be used as a source of the phosphorus. For convenience, phosphoric acid will normally be used.However, other phosphorus compounds such as phosphoryl chloride POC13 , phosphorous acid, polyphosphoric acid, phosphorus halides, such as phosphorus bromide, alkyl phosphates and alkyl phosphites such as trimethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, trimethyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite, etc. may be utilized. Also, a diaminohydrogen phosphate such as diammonium hydrogen phosphate, NH4 2HPO4, dimethyldiamino hydrogen phosphate, CH3 2NH PO4, diethylaminophydrogen phosphate CH3CH2 2NH PO4, etc. may be used. Preferably the catalyst composition is prepared by impregnating a preformed pellet.A suitable procedure to be used is to heat a liquid containing the liquid or liquefiable phosphorus compound at a temperature of about 1000 to a bout 150 C and to then add pellets in an amount about equal to the volume of the heated liquid. This treatment should be continued from about 0.5 to about 5 hours. At the end of that time, the resulting mixture of pellets and liquid is cooled, decanted to remove excess liquid followed by washing with an amount of water adequate to substantially completely remove unadsorbed liquid. Temperatures above 1500C can be used, if desired, but there is no particular advantage in doing so. It will be understood that the phosphorous that is present on a thus treated pellet is not present as elemental phosphorous, but rather as phosphorous that is chemically bound, probably as an oxide, to the groupIVb metal oxide support. This is demonstrated by the fact that repeated washing will not remove all of the phosphorous. However, the exadt nature of the bonding is not completely understood. The amount of phosphorous that is bonded or otherwise adheres to the support is a function of heating and other, conditions used in the treating step and is also a function of the chemical identity of the phosphorous compound that is used as a source of phosphorous.Under the treating conditions exemplified above, at least about 2.5 wt of phosphorous is caused to bond or otherwise permanently adhere to the pellets. There is an upper limit to the amount of phosphorous that bonds or otherwise permanently adheres to the support. This upper limit is, as indicated, a function of both the treating conditions and the chemical used as a source of the phosphorous. Normally, the maximum amount of phosphorous that can be caused to bond or otherwise permanently adhere to the pellets is within the range of about 5 to 10 wt . As a matter of convenience, the normal practice is to use only one chemical as a phosphorous source e.g., phosphoric acid . However, mixtures of two or more such reagents may be used, if desired. Calcining is not mandatory if the pellets are impregnated at least at about 1000C, but the pellets can be calcined, if desired. Calcining is conducted for 2 to 24 hours at a temperature of 1000C but below the temperature at which thermal destruction of the phosphorus bonding occurs. This can be determined experimentally for a particular catalyst e g., ExampleIV B . Temperatures above 9000C should be avoided. A suitable calcining temperature range is normally 2000 to 8000C and, more preferably, 500 to 7000C. other procedures can be used in adding phosphorous to the group IVb metal oxide. For example, the pellets can be treated with the phosphorous compound at ambient temperatures or at more modest elevated temperatures of less than about 10000. In this situation, however, it is necessary to thermally activate the treated pellets by calcining under the conditions recited above. Alternatively, the group IVb metal oxide can be treated with the phosphorous containing compound in powdered form and the powder can thereafter be pelleted.If the treatment is conducted at a temperature of about 1000C or more, thermal activation will normally have been obtained and it will not be absolutely necessary to perform a calcining operation. If lower treating temperatures are used, calcining is normally a desired operation. The calcining operation can be conducted prior to or subsequent to the pelleting step. Any appropriate pelleting procedure of the type known to those skilled in the art may be used. For example, the treated powdered group IVb metal oxide can be mixed with graphite and or other binders and compacted or extruded under conventional conditions. There are many compounds which can be formed from the reaction of ethylenediamne and monoethanolamine besides the preferred linear polyethylenepolyamines such as diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine and pentaethylenehexamine. Less desirable cyclics and other compounds, such as piperazine, N 2 aminoethyl ethanolamine and N 2 aminoethyl piperazine, are also formed. The more desired linear polyethylenepolyamines can be easily recovered from the reaction product mixture by conventional methods such as distillation. Such distillation recovery methods are well known in the art. An outstanding advantage of the claimed invention is that the lower molecular weight polyethylenepolyamines recovered from the reaction mixture can be further reacted with monoethanolamine to produce a larger percentage of the higher molecular weight linear polyethylenepolyamines. The following examples will further illustrate the preparation of predominantly linear polyethylenepolyamines from ethylenediamine and monoethanolamine by the use of the catalyst compositions of the present invention. They are given by way of illustration and not as limitations on the scope of the invention. Thus, it will be understood that reactants, proportions of reactants, and time, temperature and pressure of the reaction steps may be varied with much the same results achieved. For purposes of convenience and brevity, the reactant compounds employed and the products obtained have been abbreviated in the following examples and tables.The abbreviations employed for these various compounds are EDA ethylenediamine MEA monoethanolamine PIP piperazine DETA diethylenetriamine TETA triethylenetetramine TEPA tetraethylenepentamine AEEA N 2 aminoethyl ethanolamine AEP N 2 aminoethyl piperazine HEP N hydroxyethyl piperazine Example I 1. Titania Catalyst Preparation A series of pelleted catalysts were prepared by depositing phosphorus on a titania support. a. Phosphoric Acid Titania supported phosphoric acid catalysts were prepared by heating about 100 cc of phosphoric acid to about 1300C under an inert atmosphere in a flask fitted with a condenser. 105 cc of titania pellets were slowly added through the condenser and the temperature was maintained for the desired period of time. Thereafter the catalyst was recovered by first decanting the excess phosphoric acid followed by the addition to the pellets of a large quantity of water.The pellets and water were slowly stirred to dissipate heat. The pellets were washed several times with copious amounts of water and dried. b. Phosphoryl Chloride on Titania When using phosphoryl chloride as the source of phosphorus, a slight modification of the above identified procedures was necessary. The phosphoryl chloride was ref fluxed at 1050C. The heat was turned off and the reflux was maintained by the addition of titania pellets at a rate sufficient to maintain a strong reflux.Thereafter, heat was used to maintain the temperature. When the resulting reaction mixture was treated with water the phosphoryl chloride was hydrolysed.Constant stirring was very important in order to maintain good heat dissipation. Phosphorus bromide was also used as a source of phosphorus using the procedure outlined above for phosphoryl chloride. For convenience, the catalysts prepared and a brief description of the same is set forth herein asTables I and I A. TABLE 1 TITANIA CATALYST COMPOSITIONS Type Member Coxesition A 5464 72 40 wt.

The catalysts described in Tables I and I A were utilized for the conversion of ethylenediamine and monoethanolamine to a polyethylenepolyamine reaction product in a 100 cc continuous reactor system. Pellets were placed in the reactor and the feedstock that was fed to the reactor was a mixture of ethylenediamine and monoethanolamine in a molar ratio of about two moles of ethylenediamine per mole of monoethanolamine. In order to obtain a basis for comparison, the reaction temperature was varied so as to obtain about a 65 conversion of the monoethanolamine feedstock. The reaction product was periodically sampled and analyzed by gas chromatographic analysis of the crude reactor effluent. Results were calculated on a feedfree basis. The catalysts tested and the results obtained in the series of tests are set forth in Tables II A and Il B. In general, each feedstock was run for at least 2 hours to make sure that reaction conditions had stabilized. Referring now to Tables II A and II B it will be seen that the reference catalyst composition 5464 72 which comprised a commercially available 40 wt.E phosphate on alumina catalyst of the type disclosed inBrennan U.S. Patent No. 4,103,087 at column 8, lines 50 54 gave results which were improved upon in all instances. This run shows that with a pelleted aluminum phosphate catalyst, and in a continuous reaction, the results obtained are not so favorable as those reported for batch reactions in the copending application Serial No. 283,713. In particular, note that only about 77 of the triethylenetetramine fraction was noncyclic with this run. In contrast, with the catalyst of the present.invention the noncycTic content was normally in excess of 90 . Note also that there was also a significantly smaller yield of diethylenetriamine with the reference catalyst. The second reference catalyst 5494 4 was untreated titania pellets and it is seen that they were essentially inert insofar as conversion of monoethanolamine and ethylenediamine is concerned. The type A titania supported catalysts wherein the source of phosphorus was phosphoric acid gave uniformly good results. Essentially equivalent results were obtained with the type B catalyst, however, the pellets were not quite so strong. The same comment applies to type C catalysts wherein the support was treated with phosphoric acid and thereafter there was an additional treatment with aluminum nitrate. The best pellet strength was obtained with the type D catalyst based on phosphoryl chloride. Thus, Tables II A and II B demonstrate that with titania supported pelleted catalyst in a continuous reaction system, it is possible to obtain excellent results in the reaction of monoethanolamine with ethylenediamine. The percentage of noncyclic reaction products is very high, being over 908 in all cases except for type G when phosphorus bromide was the source of phosphorus . Diethylenetriamine yields of from about 50 to about 70 were obtained with this group of catalysts. Uniformly good yields of triethylenetetramine were also obtained.

The results of the first series of analyses is given in Table III attached. Note that with catalyst 5494 6, the phosphorus was concentrated in the initial 50 microns of the pellet surface. In addition, the exterior surface at the end of the pellet was also analyzed and the results of this analysis are set forth in Table IV.

All P concentrations are lower than those for the H3PO4 TiO2 calcined catalysts. In the case of the preceding analysis, it was demonstrated that the phosphorus was concentrated near the surface of the pellet. When catalyst 5494 13 was analyzed using the scanning electron microscope, different results were obtained, as is shown by Table VII.

Further, when the exterior surface was analyzed, as set forth in Table VIII, it was found that the phosphorus was concentrated more in the interior of the catalyst than on the exterior. This demonstrates the need for caution when extrapolating from one catalyst composition to another in reactions of this nature.

It is interesting that the lowest P 1 concentration above corresponds to the lowest concentration within the pellet. The catalyst compositions were also analyzed byX ray defraction in bulk and after being powdered. The results of the X ray examination indicated that the titania that was used was in a single phase, namely as anatase. Phosphating of the titania with phosphoric acid produced the well known compound Ti HPO4 2 2H2O. In addition, an unknown Ti PO4 compound was also detected. The X ray defraction pattern was quite similar to that of three known triphosphates, namely AgTi2 PO4 3, BaFeTi P04 3 andGeNb PO4 3.Accordingly, the unknown was identified as a triphosphate possibly formed by the following reaction 2TiO2 2Ti HP04 3 g 2HTi2 P04 3 2H2O Indexing of the unknown s pattern is given inTable IX, which follows TABLE IX Indexing of Ti, PO4 Unknown Pattern d Spacings, A MillerIntensity Obsd Calculatedl Indices w 6.05 6.11 012 w 4.35 4.41 014 w 4.20 4.23 110 m 3.68 3.68 006 s 3.50 3.48 202 TiO2 also m 3.32 3.29 106 w 3.22 3.16 007 w 3.03 3.05 024 m 2.75 2.75 211 m 2.03 2.04 036 w 1.95 1.96 128 w 1.83 1.84 0.0.12 w 1.60 1.60 140 w 1.28 1.28 514 w 1.25 1.25 3 1 14 1Calculated usingEMI32.1 where hkQ are Miller indices, a and c are lattice constants, 8.474 and 22.11A, respectively. The X ray defraction analysis studies further indicated that calcining converted essentially all of the Ti HPO4 2.H2O to the new compound. The crystal size of the latter was determined to be about l25A. However, with respect to catalyst 5494 11 it was found that only a part of the Ti HPO4 2 was converted to the new compound. The new compound was not detected in sample 5494 13. The results obtained from the catalyst pellet analysis are extremely interesting in a number of respects. First, it is clearly demonstrated that new catalyst compositions were obtained in the case of the samples 5494 6 and 5494 11. Otherwise the new phosphorus compound would not have been found. Further, the superior activity obtained with a titania support is not solely attributable to the presence of the new comound as shown by the results obtained in Table II. Finally, the interaction between the phosphorus and the titania support will vary depending upon the chemical nature of the source of the phosphorus but, again as shown by Table II, uniformly good rsults are obtained when titania is used as a catalyst support for a phosphorus containing compound. Example I ATitania Catalyst Preparation A series of pelleted catalysts were prepared by depositing phosphorus on a titania support. A flask containing 65.0 g of NH4 2HPO4, 150 cc of titania pellets and 50 cc of water was spun on a roto evaporator under aspirator pressure at room temperature for 2 hours. The contents of the flask were then poured onto a sieve and washed with a small amount of water. The wet pellets were then charged to a tubular furnace and dry nitrogen was passed through at ca.50 cc hr. The pellets were dried by heating the furnace to 600C for 3 hours, then to 800C for 1 hour and then to 900C overnight. The temperature of the furnace was then increased by 10 C every 30 60 minutes until a temperature of 2500C was reached. This temperature was maintained for 16 hours. Analysis of the resulting catalyst by atomic absorption indicated a phosphorus content of 4.3 wt . The catalyst was then placed in a 25 cc tubular continuous reactor system. A 2 1 wt wt EDA MEA feed was charged to the reactor at a space velocity of 1.0 g cc hr. Data are presented below which compare the activity and product selectivity of this catalyst to a commercially available 40 wtt phosphate on alumina catalyst of the type disclosed in Brennan U.S. PatentNo. 4,103,087 at column 8, lines 50 54.

About 100 cc of titania pellets were slowly added through the condenser and the temperature was maintained for four hours. Thereafter the catalyst was recovered by first decanting the excess trimethyl phosphate followed by the addition to the pellets of a large quantity of water. The pellets and water were slowly stirred to dissipate heat. The pellets were washed several times with copious amounts of water and dried. For convenience, the catalyst prepared and a brief description of the same is set forth herein as Table I B. TABLE I B TITANIA CATALYST COMPOSITIONS Number Composition 5464 72 40 wt.

The catalysts described in Table I B were utilized for the conversion of ethylenediamine and monoethanolamine to a polyethylenepolyamine reaction product in a 100 cc continuous reactor system. Pellets were placed in the reactor and the feedstock that was fed to the reactor with a mixture of ethylenediamine and monoethanolamine in a molar ratio of about two moles of ethylenediamine per mole of monoethanolamine. In order to obtain a basis for comparison, the reaction temperature was varied so as to obtain about a 65 conversion of the monoethanolamine feedstock. The reaction product was periodically sampled and analyzed by gas chromatographic analysis of the crude reactor effluent. Results were calculated on a feedfree basis. The catalysts tested and the results obtained in the series of tests are set forth in Table I C. In general, each feedstock was run for at least 2 hours to make sure that reaction conditions had stabilized. Referring now to Table I C it will be seen that the reference catalyst composition 5464 72 which comprised a commercially available 40 wt. phosphate on alumina catalyst of the type disclosed in Brennan U.S.Patent No. 4,103,087 at column 8, lines 50 54 gave less satisfactory results than those obtained with the catalyst of the present invention. This run shows that with a pelleted aluminum phosphate catalyst, and in a continuous reaction, the results obtained are not so favorable as those reported for batch reactions in the copending application Serial No. 283,713. In particular, note that the reaction product contained less than 40 of diethylenetriamine while the reaction product formed using the catalyst of the present invention contained over 65 of diethylenetriamine. The second reference tests 5494 4 was untreated titania pellets and it is seen that they were essentially inert insofar as conversion of monoethanolamine and ethylenediamine is concerned. Thus, Table I C demonstrates that with titania supported pelleted catalyst in a continuous reaction system, it is possible to obtain excellent results in the reaction of monoethanolamine with ethylenediamine.Diethylenetriamine yields of more than 65 were obtained.A good yield of triethylenetetramine was also obtained.This was particularly so in respect of the catalyst compositions where the source of the phosphorous was triethyl phosphite.

This series of tests demonstrates that the zirconia supported catalysts give results equivalent to those obtained with titania. An attempt to analyze the zirconia supported catalysts using a scanning electron microscope were unsuccessful because the phosphorus content of the PK emission line waive length, 6.1549A is very close to the ZrL emission line, 6.0776A. These two lines could not be resolved using the electronic discriminator with which the scanning electron microscope was fitted. Insofar as X ray defraction analysis is concerned, it was determined that the zirconia was an equimix of monoclinic zirconia, baddeleyite and a tetragonal phase usually formed at higher temperatures. Surface scrapings from the zirconia catalyst that had been treated with the phosphorous compound contained some rather large crystals of ZrP207. Because of their low surface area, it is doubtful that this ZrP207 is responsible for the excellent activity of the zirconia supported catalyst. The ZrP207 X ray pattern is weak, indicating that ZrP207 represents a small fraction of the phosphorus present. It is probable that another phosphorous compound that is amorphous is the catalytically active species. Example IIIRecycle Studies The IVb metal oxide supports tend to shift product distribution towards diethylenetriamine. There are times when it is desirable to obtain greater yields of triethylenetetramine or tetraethylenepentamine. Accordingly, a series of recycle tests were run to determine the feasibility of recycle of diethylenetriamine. The reaction sequence described above for the 100 ml. reactor was used for the recycle studies. However, 20 wt. of the ethylenediamine in the feed was replaced with diethylenetriamine in two runs and all of the monoethanolamine was replaced with diethylenetriamine in the other two runs. The catalyst compositions that were used are identified in Table XII and the results of the simulated recycle tests are set out in Table XIII.

Example IV A This example is illustrative of the long term stability and activity of catalyst compositions of the present invention and of the low susceptibility of such catalyst compositions to poisoning. A fresh batch of catalyst 5544 20 was prepared using the procedure of Example Ib to prepare a catalyst as set forth in Example I in respect of catalyst 5494 23. Catalyst 5544 20 was used for a prolonged life study using the equipment and procedures of Example I.In this instance, however, more severe reaction temperature conditions were used in order to accelerate the effects of long term usage. For this purpose a monoethanolamine conversion of 80 was established and maintained throughout about 2000 hours of reaction time. At the end of that time the run was arbitrarily terminated. Representative results of the test are set forth in Table XIV A.

The temperature required to maintain MEA conver sion at 80 increased from 3150C to about 3350C during the first 1000 hours of operating, indicating a slight loss in activity. The use of a temperature of 3350C at the end of the run indicates an overall moderate loss of activity. Example IV B Catalyst Regeneration A titania supported phosphate catalyst prepared in accordance with Example I was charged to a 100 cc continuous reactor and subjected to an accelerated aging test using, as a feed a mixture of ethylenediamine and monoethanolamine in a ratio of 2 mols of ethylene diamine per mol of monoethanolamine. The feed was charged at a liquid hourly at the rate of about 1 volume of liquid feed per hour per volume of catalyst. Pressure was held at 1500 libs. 103.4 bar and the temperature was adjusted to give about an 80 MEA conversion. At the beginning of the run at a tempera ture of about 3250C, analysis indicated a conversion of monoethanolamine of about 78 , a ratio of diethylene triamine to piperazine of about 19 and a reaction product containing about 94 noncyclic compounds in the triethylenetetramine fraction. In a duplicate run at 3250 the initial MEA conversion is found to be about 81 and the ratio of diethylenetriamine to piperazine was found to be about 17 the percent of noncyclic products in the triethylenetetramine fraction was found to be about 93 . In order to simulate a prolonged run, an accelerated aging procedure was used wherein the catalyst bed was held at reaction conditions without feed for a period of about 2 weeks.After the 2 week period, a temperature of about 3450C was required to obtain about an 80 conversion of monoethanolamine. In a specific run, after two weeks of accelerated aging,MEA conversion was 83 , the ratio of DETA to PIP was 7 with only about 72 noncyclic products in the TETA fraction. Thereafter, the catalyst was regenerated in accordance with the following procedure 1 The catalyst bed was heated to about 4500C 2 A mixture of about 100 cc per minute of air in 700 cc per minute of nitrogen was passed through the catalyst bed for about 1 hour 3 Next a mixture of about 100 cc per minute of air and 300 cc per minute of nitrogen was passed over the catalyst bed for about 1 hour 4 Thereafter air was charged without inert gas at the rate of 100 cc per minute for 2 hours and 5 The catalyst bed was flushed with nitrogen while cooling over night. After regeneration the catalyst was again tested for activity and at a temperature of 3250C the monoethanolamine conversion was about 77 the ratio of diethylenetriamine to piperazine was about 19 and the percentage of noncyclic products in triethylenetetramine fraction was once again 94 . Thus, regeneration had been successfully performed. When the preceding regeneration procedure was attempted at 3500C, regeneration was unsuccessful while at 4000C the results were unsatisfactory. An attempt to regenerate the catalyst by heating at 3500C in a nitrogen stream was unsuccessful. An attempt to regenerate the catalyst by washing at 2500C with feed was also ineffective. Example V This example is illustrative of the utility of hafnia as a support in the preparation and use of the catalyst compositions of the present invention. The amount of hafnia available was insufficient to permit the preparation of the number of pellets required for a continuous evaluation using the equipment and reaction conditions of Example I. However, enough hafnia was available to permit a batch evaluation using powdered catalyst. Catalyst Preparation Typically, these catalysts were prepared by addition of 50 g of the metal oxide powder to 150 cc of 85 H3PO4 at 1300C. This temperature was maintained for approximately five hours. The solids were then separated by filtration through a fritted glass funnel filter paper systems were not adequate as the phosphoric acid caused disintegration of the paper and subsequent product loss. The product was then washed to remove excess phosphoric acid and dried. General Experimental Procedures All batch reactions were carried out in a 300 cc stainless steel, rocking autoclave. They were used with glass liners to minimize the effects of catalyst derived impurities from the crave walls. The general procedure consisted of placing 6.1 g 20 wtt basis MEA of catalyst in a liner followed by addition of 60.5 g of a 1.1 EDA MEA mixture 30 g EDA and 30.5 g MEA . The liner was placed in the reactor, the system was purged with nitrogen, and finally heated to 3150C for 2 hours. The crude reaction product was filtered from the catalyst and analyzed by GC using anOV 17 chromatography column. The supports used for this series of tests included titania, zirconia and hafnia. Powdered T1067 was also run to provide a basis for comparison. The results are set forth in Table XV.

However, they do provide a qualitative measure of catalyst suitability. It can be concluded from the results of Table XV that pelleted thermally activated catalyst compositions comprising hafnia having phosphorous derived from phosphoric acid deposited thereon will give results analogous to those obtained in Example I and Example II where titania and zirconia, respectively, were used as supports. The foregoing examples of the present invention have been given by way of illustration only and are not intended as limitations on the scope of the invention which is defined by the following claims.
