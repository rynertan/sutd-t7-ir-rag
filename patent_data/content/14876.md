# Improved portable electrically energized surface finishing tool.

## Abstract
A portable, electrically energized surface finishing tool for use with peripherally and planar acting finishing devices comprises an elongated tool body 20 having a length and distal first 37 and second 31 opposite ends. A tool support handle 36 is positioned adjacent the first end 37 of the tool and a support spindle 30 which is adapted to receive a peripherally acting surface finishing tool 48 is positioned adjacent the second opposite end 31 of the tool. The support handle 36 and the spindle 30 are mutually orientated for providing that the spindle extends horizontally and trans versely to the tool body length when the support handle 36 is positioned vertically. A guard means 62 is positioned bet ween the spindle and the support handle 36 . Ease of use and balance is imparted to the tool by positioning an electric drive motor armature shaft at a location intermediate the first and second ends 37,31 and extending from a side of the tool opposite to the side from which the spindle 30 extends. The armature shaft extends transversely with respect to the length of the tool.
