# CCD driven integrated optical modulator array.

## Abstract
A CCD driven integrated optical modulator array includ ing an array of chirp grating optical lenses implemented on the surface of an electro optcal crystal such as LiNbO₃ or LiTaO₃, a plurality of channel waveguides and a thin metal film pattern on the surface of the waveguides for modulating the optical waveform in each channel. The thin metal film form planar capacitors, each of the capacitors being electri cally connected to the output circuit of a corresponding semi conductor device, such as a CCD array. The CCD array is implemented on a semiconductor wafer bonded to the electro optical crystal. Signals in each optical channel in the electro optical crystal are thereby modulated by correspond ing circuit elements associated with corresponding CCD channels implemented on the major surface of the semicon ductor wafer.
