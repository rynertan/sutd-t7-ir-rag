A mirror 20 for a spectrophotometer has a slit 30 , reflective portions 32 and transparent portions 34 . When the mirror is illuminated from one side, light passes through the slit 30 and transparent portions 34 to a first location, and some light is reflected by the portions 32 to a second location. Similarly, when the mirror is illuminated from the other side, some light passes through the slit 30 and trans parent portions 34 to the second location, and some light is reflected by the portions 32 to the first location.
