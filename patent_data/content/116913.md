# FORMWORK AND METHOD OF FORMING BUILDINGS

## Abstract
Formwork for casting buildings consisting of inner formwork with side walls and suffit formwork, and outer formwork with side walls, which surround the inner form work with a space there between. In order to secure standardization of the form elements, the formwork is designed on basis of a modular network, while the distance between vertical planes 1 , passing through the spaces between the side walls is a multiple of a modular distance. The side walls of the inner formwork and the outer formwork consist of column elements 8, 9 and 10, 11 , which are placed with a bay inbetween their sides, corresponding to the modular distance M minus a fraction, i.e. the width of a modular zone Z thereof. In those bays, which are formed between column elements 8, 9 and 10, 11 , there are placed filling in forms 6 , the length of which correspond to the width of the bay, and whose width corresponds to a multiple of the width of the modular zone Z . The suffit formwork consists of structural elements 3,4 and 5 , which are supported by the columns 8, 9 of the inner formwork, and which between their mutually facing side edges form bays, the width of which correspond to the width of the bays of the side walls, and whose length correspond to a multiple of the modular zone Z . In the bays of the suffit formwork there are placed filling in forms 6 and 7 corresponding to the filling in forms 6 of the side walls.
