# Stereo Camera.

## Abstract
A stereoscopic camera 5 with two lenses 10 , in which each lens 10 is supported by a support table 22 fixed rigidly in two parallel resilient plates 34 . Simultaneous focussing and convergence of the lenses 10 is brought about by a cam 30 urging the plates 34 to bend, thereby constraining both lenses 10 to follow the required straight line loci.
