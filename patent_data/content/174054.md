# Heat sensitive element for use in a thermal imaging method.

## Abstract
A heat sensitive element is provided which is intended for use in a thermal imaging method for forming color images which relies upon the irreversible unimolecular fragmentation of one or more thermally unstable carbamate moieties of an organic compound to effect a visually discernible color shift from colorless to colored, from colored to colorless or from one color to another.
