## Description
Reduction Projection Aligner System BACKGROUlTD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to improvements in a reduction projection aligner system for use in the semiconductor production. The reduction projection aligner system is used for the semiconductor production, and forms the patterns of semiconductor integrated circuits such as ICs and LSls directly on wafers. In many of conventional reduction projection aligner systems, the wafer and a reticle a glass plate on which an original pattern is depicted have been positioned independently of each other. More specifically, the reticle is positioned by visually detecting two typical portions on the reticle with a reticle positioning optical microscope and is fix onto the body of the apparatus, while the wafer is positioned by visually detecting two typical portions on the wafer with a wafer positioning optical microscope and is fixed onto the body.With the method in Wnich the whole wafer is positioned on the basis of the two typical portions on the wafer in this manner, the precision of the alignment between the reticle and the wafer defends rrirciDally on the positionintr Precision of the wafer, which forms a serious hindrance to the enhancenen of the alignment precision. In addition, it is impossible to align the reticle and the wafer as regards the arrangernen error of the pattern attributed to the anisotropic expansion or contraction of the wafer occurring when the wafer undergoes a manufacturing process. Therefore, in order to eliminate such disadvantages and to make a high precision alignment possible, there has been devised a method as shown in Figure 1 wherein the position of a wafer is relatively detected through a reticle as well as a reduction lens refer to JapanesePatent Application Laid open Specification c. 54 93974 .In the reduction projection aligner system shown inFigure 1, a pattern for positioning formed on a wafer 4 by a preceding step is illuminated by a light guide 7 through a reference pattern 5 formed on an edge of a reticle 2 and further through a reduction lens 3, and using the reflected light, the positioning pattern on the wafer is focused on the reticle 2 contrariwise.On the other hand, In order to detect the position of the reticle 2, the reference pattern 5 on the reticle 2 is illuminated by a light guide 6. Thus, the reflected lights from the wafer 4 and the reticle 2 are projected on the position of a slit 10 by a magnifying optical system 9, the distance of movement of the slit 10 is measured by a uniaxial movable table 12 and a measuring machine 13, and an output from a photodetector 11 corresponding to the position of the slit 10 is detected, whereby the relative positions of the reticle 2 and the wafer 4 are detected. With this system, however, the predetermined reference pattern 5 needs to be formed in a specified position on the reticle 2 separately from a circuit pattern and a reticle positioning pattern which is used for positioning the reticle 2 to a holder 14 ,, and it forms a serious hindrance in preparing the reticle. Moreover, the arrangement error of the reference pattern 5 with respect to the circuit pattern becomes the alignment error between the reticle 2 and the wafer 4. Evrther, since the relative positions of the reticle 2 and the wafer 4 are detected, an optical system for illuminating the reticle surface as consists of the light guide 6 and a mirror 8 is installed, the installation being very difficult. In the figure, numeral 1 designates a condensing lens. SUluIARY Or THE INVENTION This invention has been made in view of the above drawoach3, and has for its object to provide a reduction projection aligner system in which a positioning pattern on a wafer obtained through a reduction lens is detected by the use of a detecting optical system easy of installation, thereby to permit a high precision detection of the wafer position relative to the body of the system. In order to accomplish the object, according to this invention, in a reduction projection aligner system which forms the patterns of semiconductor integrated circuits such as ICs and LSIs directly on wafers, when a pattern on a wafer already formed by a preceding step and a pattern to be formed anew are to be aligned, the positioning pattern on the wafer is optically magnified and projected and then focused, the focused plane is scanned by a slit having its mechanical origin on the body of the system, the brightness of light passing through the slit is photoelectrically converted in correspondence with the movement of the slit, and the distance from the mechanical origin of the slit to the positioning pattern of the wafer is measured, thereby to calculate the position of the wafer relative to the body of the reduction projection aligner system, and a reticle having the pattern to be formed anew is relatively moved so as to coincide with the wafer, to execute the so called alignment.BRIEF DESCRIPTl00J OF TRITE DRAa GS Figure 1 is a view for explaining a reduction projection aligner system already proposed, Fi ure 2 is a view for explaining an embodiment of this invention, Figure 3 is a view showing the details of a pattern detecting portion, Figure 4 is a view showing an example of a positioning pattern on a wafer projected on a slit, and Figure 5 is a graph showing examples of signals stored in a central processing unit. DETAILED DESCRiPT.IOH OF THE PREFERRED 30DIMEI .TS Hereunder, this invention will be described in detail with reference to embodiments. A conceptual diagram of a reduction projection aligner system according to this invention is shown in Figure 2. the system of this invention greatly differs from the system shown in Figure 1 in the following points. A part of the holder 14 to place a reticle 2 thereon is provided with a hole 15 so as to illuminate a pattern on a wafer by the light guide 7 through the reduction projection lens 3 similarly to the system shown in Figure 1. Therefore, the reticle 2 to be placed on the holder 14 does not need to be provided with the special reference mark 5 as shown in Figure 1, and it may merely have a structure adapted to transmit light through the edge thereof. Further, the light guide 6 for illuminating the reference mark 5 is unnecessary, and one mirror 8 suffices.In addItion, the pattern for example, a rectilinear rnark usualloy having a width of 6 jtm or so on the wafer as focused on the reticle is projected on the position of the slit 10 through the optical system 9. At this tine, an origin sensor 16 is disposed in the movable range of the slit 10, and the distance from the origin of the slit 10 to the positioning pattern of the wafer is measured by the measuring machine 13. The origin sensor 16 is tixed,on the body of the system, so that the distance of movement of the slit to the positioning pattern on the wafer after the slit has passed through the origin sensor 16 is gauged as the position of the wafer relative to the body of the system. The details of a pattern detecting portion are shown in Figure 3. On the uniaxial movable table 12, there are placed the slit 10, a member to be detected 21 for the origin sensor 16, and a glass scale 13 , The glass scale 13t is movable only in the direction of arrow 22 with the movement of the uniaxial movable table 12. An index scale 19 is fixed at a predetermined spacing with respect to the glass scale 13l. The glass scale 13 and the index scale 19 are overlaid with gratings at equal spacings, and they are sandwiched in between a light source 17 as well as a lens 18 and a photodetector 20.Light projected from the light source 17 towards the photodetector 20 repeats brilliance and darkness each time the gratings of the glass scale moves one pitch with respect to the index scale 19, and it is taken out as a sinusoidal signal. Since the output signal from the photodetector 20 is feeble as it is, it is amplified by a pre amplifier 23. Further, the amplified signal is passed through a waveform shaping circuit 24 as well as a direction discriminator 28 and is indicated as a digital quantity by a digital counter 29.On the other hand, as the origin sensor 16, there is employed by way of example a magnetic transducer which applies the principle of magnetic recording. I .hen the magnetic conductor 21 which is the member to be detected placed on the movable table 12 moves in the sense of the arrow 22, an analog output of, for example, about 1 mV m is produced via the magnetic transducer 16 as well as a detecting circuit 25, and it is turned into a pulse output by a waveform changing circuit 26. Herein, the system is operated under the condition that the spacing between the magnetic transducer 16 and the magnetic conductor 21 is set at, for example, below 0.5 mm.Thus, when the magnetic conductor 21 placed on the movable table 12 passes in front of the magnetic transducer 16, the pulse output is obtained at a reproduction precision of approximately 1 prri. On the other hand, the brilliance and darkness of light having passed through the slit is photoelectrically converted by the photomultiplier ,1, the output of which is applied to an analog to digital converter 27. The A D converter 27 digitizes the photomultiplier output in synchronism with the counter output lrom the digital counter 29, and applies the digital signal to a central processing unit 30. After having received the pulse output from the magnetic transducer 16, theCPU 30 receives the A D converted value of the photomultiplier output in proportion to the count quantity of the digital counter 29 and stores it therein. Figure 4 shows an example of the positioning pattern 31 on the wafer projected on the position of the slit 10. Figure 5 shows examples of signals stored in theCPU 30 at this time. The axis of abscissas represents the position X of the slit, while the axis of ordinates represents the A D converted value Y of the photomultiplier output indicative of the intensity or the brilliance and darkness of the light passing through the slit.The digital value of the photoraultiplier output begins to be received at a position Xo at which the pulse from the origin sensor is received. I Y nen data are received in proportion to the count quantity of the digital counter 29, the input data at the i th count value Xi becomes Y. By processing the signals shown 1 1 in Figure 5 and evaluating the position Xc of the slit indicative of the center of the positioning pattern 31 on the wafer, the distance of movement of the slit from the origin thereof is obtained. The central coordinates of the positioning pattern on the wafer as included in this output signal can be evaluated with, for example, the following method refer to U. S. Patent 4153341 . An arbitrary position X. of the slit is supposed as a tentative center, and data on both sides thereof amounting to 2 m are superposed to calculate Zi Here, letting Yi denote an output signal at the position Xi, Zi is calculated as follows EMI9.1 Smong the changes of Z thus obtained, a point which gives the minimum value of Z becomes the central position of the pattern on the wafer. In this manner, the positioning pattern on the wafer is magnified and focused through the optical lens, and the focused plane is scanned by the slit having its mechanical origin on the body of the system so as to photoelectrically detect the intensity of the light passing through the slit in accordance with the position of movement of the slit, thereby to measure the position of the wafer relative to the body at high precision, whereupon the wafer and the reticle positioned to the body with the separate detecting optical system are aligned. As set forth above, according to this invention, the position of the positioning pattern on the wafer is detected in the position in which the pattern is magnified and projected by the optical system of the simple construction includino the reduction lens, whereby the high precision positional detection has become possible. Experiments have revealed that the detection and reproduction precision of the positioning pattern on the wafer in this invention is enhanced to double the precision in the system shown in Figure 1.
