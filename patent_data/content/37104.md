# CLUTCH WITH PYROLYTIC CARBON FRICTION MATERIAL

## Abstract
Disclosed is a locking differential 10 including an oil lubricated clutch assembly 18 having a plurality of inter leaved friction discs 48, 50, 60 and 62 formed of steel and squeezed together to retard relative rotation of differential side gears 32 and 34. Adjacent friction discs have mutually facing friction surfaces. One of each mutually facing friction surface is defined by the metal forming the disc and the other surface is defined by a pyrolytic carbon composite friction material 78. In one form, the friction material includes a meshed cloth substrate formed of carbon fibers, which may be woven into a single layer of cloth, and a coating of carbon deposited on the fibers by chemical vapor deposition to a level forming a friction material having a relatively open mesh which is readily penetrated by an adhesive to improve bonding of the friction material to the discs.
