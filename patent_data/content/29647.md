# Methods and apparatus for pre collation copying duplex documents.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus 10,20 for precollation copying a set of duplex document sheets by inhibiting 100 the operation of a document inverting path 40, 60, 58 during successions of contiguous plural document copying circula tions to copy only one side of the documents during each succession, and actuating the document inverter path only during single document circulations at the end of a succes sion, after the document set has been circulated a number of times in that succession equal to the quotient of a constant number divided by the number of document sheets in the document set. Opposite sides of the documents are copied in alternate successions, and all the copies made during every other succession of plural recirculations are temporarily stored in a buffer set 108 of a pre determined maximum desired copy sheet capacity. The constant number corres ponds to this copy sheet capacity.
