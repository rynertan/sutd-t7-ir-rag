# Vibration absorber for an automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
A vibration absorber for an automotive vehicle which can prevent the shuddering phenomenon even while the vehicle is gradually accelerated or decelerated. The rubber member thereof is provided with multistep elasticity characteristics such that a first shearing portion of the rubber member is first deformed in shear, a second shearing portion thereof is next deformed in shear, and the other portion thereof is lastly deformed under compression. To achieve the above mentioned elasticity characteristics, some appropriately sized slots, cavities, or gaps are provided within the rubber member at appropriate positions within the rubber member.
