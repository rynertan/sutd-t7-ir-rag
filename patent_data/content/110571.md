# Method of assembling multicell electric storage batteries.

## Abstract
A method of assembling a multicell lead acid battery in cludes forming a laminated structure from a plurality of flat plate arrays. Each array comprises positive and negative plates 11, 14 connected to at least one further plate in the same array by at least one link 28, 15. The arrays are super posed so that each plate is in registry with a plate of oppo site polarity in the adjacent array and separated from it by separator material 30. One or more cuts are made to sever selected links 15 to form a plurality of stacks of plates of al ternating polarity which constitute the individual cells in the finished battery with each plate, with the exception of every other plate in the two electrical end stacks of plates, electri cally connected by one or more integral links 28 to only a plate of opposite polarity in the same array and with every alternate plate in the two electrical end stacks of plates con nected to no other plate. In the finished battery each plate in each cell lies in a common plane with one plate in every other cell.
