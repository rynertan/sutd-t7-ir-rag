## Description
DINITROANILINE YIELD ENHANCING AGENTS FOR LEGUMES SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is a method to improve the yield of stem and root crops and of the seeds and of the fruits of leguminous plants by applying to the foliage and stems of said plants, or to soil containing the seeds of said plants a yield enhancing amount of a compound of formula I EMI1.1 wherein R1 is selected from H, CH3, and C2H5 R2 is selected from H, C1 C5 alkyl saturated or unsaturated straight chain or branched, and optionally substituted with OH, C1, and OCH R3 is selected from OCH3, or CH2R5 R4 is selected from CH3, C2H5, n C3H7, i C3H7, n C4H9,S02CH3, SO2NH2, and CF3 R5 is selected from H, OCH3, and CN. A preferred group of compounds represented by formula I above are those wherein R1 is H, or C2H5 R2 is H, or C3 C5 branched chain alkyl, optionally sub stituted with OH, Cl, and OCH R3 is CH3, CH2CCH3 and CH2CN R4 is CH3, C2H5, n C3H7, and i C3H7. Another, more preferred group of compounds of formula t are those, wherein R1 is H R2 is wH H3 , CH CH3 C2H5t CH C2H5 2, EMI2.1 CH2OCH3 R4 is C2H5, n C3H7, or 1 C3H7. Of specific interest is the compound N iso propyl 2,6 dinitro 4 propyl m toluidine. The compounds of formula I are disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 4,025,538 No. 4,101,582, and appli cation for United States Letter Patent, Serial No. 60,522, placed July 25, 1979, now allowed all of the above are incorporated herein by way of reference. As indicated above, application of a compound of formula I to stem, root and to leguminous crops or to soil in which the seeds of such crops are sown increases the yields of same. Obviously, yield increases of stem crops, such as sugarcane, potatoes, cassava root, sweet potatoes, taro root, garlic and onions root crops, such as sugar beets, carrots, horseradish, radishes, turnips and yams, and leguminous crops, are most advantageous to the farmer. The real significance of the invention, however, lies in the fact that leguminous crops are a good and cheap source of high quality protein, suitable to replace at least in part meat proteins which are essential to prevent malnutrition, yet are in short supply worldwide. An additional advantage of using the compounds of formula I may manifest itself in increased branching, earlier and more uniform flowering, and earlier and more uniform maturing of said leguminous plants. In practice, we have found, that the application of a compound of formula I to the foliage of seedling plants or to soil containing the seeds of said plants in amounts of from about 0.1 kg per hectare to about 1.5 kg per hectare and preferably from about 0 2 to about 1.0 kg per hectare is sufficient to achieve the desirable and advantageous biological responses described above. The compounds of formula I are formulated as dusts, dust concentrates, wettable powders, granulars, emulsion concentrates, and the like. Dusts are generally prepared by grinding together from about 1 to 15 by weight of the active material with from about 998 to 85 by weight of a solid diluent, such as attaclay, kaolin, ciatomaceous earth, fullers earth, talc, pumice or the like. Dust concentrates are prepared in similar fash ion to the dusts excepting that generally about 15 to about 95t by weight of active material is used. Granular formulations may be prepared by apply ing a liquid solution of the active material to sorptive granular carriers such as attaclay, kaolin or diatotnite granules. Alternatively, they may be mixed with inert carriers and applied to non sorptive granules, such as sand or limestone. Wettable powders are prepared by grinding the active ingredient with a solid carrier, such as used in the dust formulations. Usually, about 25 to 75 by weight of the active material and from about 73t to 23 by weight of solid carrier is used. In addition, there is generally added about 1 to 5 by weight of a dispersing agent, such as alkali metal salts of naph thalene sulfuric acid and anionic nonionic blends, and from about 1 to 5 by weight of a surfactant, such as polyoxyethylene alcohols, acids, adducts, sorbitan fatty acid esters and sorbitol esters. Emulsion concentrates are prepared by dissolv ing 158 to 70 by weight of the compound in 85 to 305 by weight of a solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, kerosene, 2 methoxy ethanol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ester, formamide, methylformamide and the like, and mixtures thereof.Advantageously, surfactants such as polyoxyethylated vegetable oil or an alkyl phenoxy polyoxyethylene ethanol are also incorporated in amounts of 1 to 5 by weight of said concentrate. In using wettable powders, emulsion concentrates and the like, the formulated material is generally dispersed in water and applied at a rate of from 0.1 kg hectare to about 1.0 kg per hectare to the plants or to the soil containing the seeds of said plants. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples which are not to be taken as being limitative thereof. EXAMPLE 1Evaluation of test comPounds for increasina the drv weight of soybean oods. In the following tests, the appropriate compounds are dissolved or dispersed in acetone V ter 50 50 mixtures at the final concentration corresponding to the kg ha rates indicated in Table I below.

In the following tests, test compounds are dissolved or dispersed in acetone water l l mixtures at the final concentration corresponding to the kg ha rates indicated in the table below. The solution also contains 0.25 v v colloidal BIOFILMs a product ofColloidal Products Corp. which is a mixture of alkyl aryl polyethoxyethanol, free and combined fatty acids, glvcol ethers, dialkylbenzene carboxylate and 2 propanol. The plant species used in these tests are soil beans Glycine max cv. Adelphia. The solution or dispersion of the compound under test is sprayed at a rate of 77 l ha with a moving nozzle along an overhead stationary track. The spray nozzle moves at a constant speed over the plants. The plants are grown in plastic pots, and are well established at the time of treatment. The seedlings of soybeans are at the first trifoliate stage. Plants are watered prior to treatment and then sprayed to provide the kg ha rate of test compound desired. After spraying the plants are placed on greenhouse benches and watered and fertilized in accordance with normal greenhouse procedures. Three weeks after treatment the plants are examined to determine what effect the application of test compound had on axillary branching, earlier bloom, and number of flowers of plants. Increased axillary branching and earlier and increased blooming are biological responses which are highly advantageous in the growing of crops. These responses are frequently indicative of an increase in the production of fruit. Data obtained in these tests are reported in Table III as percent change increase or decrease over untreated controls.

Sugar beets Saccharum officinarum var.Monogram are planted in separate 12.5 cm diameter fiber pots. The compound under test N isopropyl 2,6 dinitro n propyl m toluidine is dissolved or dispersed in water at the final concentrations indicated in Table IX below. The solutions also contain 0.1 to 0.25 v v colloidal BIOFILMO a product of ColloidalProducts Corp. which is a mixture of alkyl aryl polyethoxyethanol, free and combined fatty acids, glycol ethers, dialkylbenzene carboxylate and 2 propanol. In these tests, the sugar beet seedlings are at the eight leaf stage when treated. The pots are watered, treated and placed on benches in a random arrangement in the greenhouse.Normal watering and fertilizing practices are followed pesticides are applied to the plants as needed .Minimum day and night temperature of 180C is maintained during cooler periods of the year. Normal daily fluctuations occur during the summer season. Plants are sprayed to provide the kg ha rates indicated in Table IX below. The sugar beets are harvested 70 days posttreatment and dried. The yields are averaged and compared to those obtained from the untreated controls, and are expressed as percent change over the controls.
