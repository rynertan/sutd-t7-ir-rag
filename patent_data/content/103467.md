# FIBER OPTIC DATA DISTRIBUTOR

## Abstract
A fiber optic data distribution system for transferring data between a plurality of terminals 72, 74, 76, 78 . Each terminal is connected to a dedicated portion of separate fiber optical material 111a, 111b, 111c, 111d and may be uniquely addressed by encoding the optical signal with a distinct ad dress code. Optical signals may be supplied from a central pro cessing unit 67 to one or more terminals 72, 74, 76, 78 . Al ternatively, an optical signal may be supplied by a terminal 72, 74, 76, 78 and transmitted to another terminal 72, 74, 76, 78 , or the central processing unit 67 .
