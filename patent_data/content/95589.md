# Internal combustion engine ignition system with improvement.

## Abstract
In the combination of an internal combustion engine which has an electronic ignition system that develops a continuous high voltage AC type spark signal, there is an improvement which provides for controlling the duration of the spark signals. Such duration control acts to vary the crank angle degrees that are encompassed by the spark duration, which variation is in accordance with an engine parameter. The parameter may be engine load, and the variation control saves spark energy consumed while ex tending the life of the spark plugs.
