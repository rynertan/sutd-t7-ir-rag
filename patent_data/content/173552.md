## Description
The present invention provides novel recombinant DNA rDNA compounds and methods for incorporating these novel compounds into the expressed genetic material of cells and cell lines, whereby novel cells and cell lines are thereby produced and comprise yet another element of the invention herein. Most particularly, the present invention relates to the incorporation of recombinant DNA compounds into the expressed genetic material of higher eukoryotic cells for expression of preselected polypeptides. Methods of synthesis of recombinant DNA compounds are well known in the art. Moreover, these techniques have been extensively cataloged. Refer, for example, to T. Maniatis, et al., Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor. New York 1982 . Also, for a general discussion of recombinant DNA compounds and their synthesis and use in molecular biology, refer to J.D. Watson, et al., Recombinant DNA A Short Course, Scientific American Books, New York, New York 1983 , and the extensive bibliography of references cited therein. DNA compounds in accordance with the present invention are those biologically useful polymers of deoxyribonucleic acid linked together by 5 3 phosphodiester bonds between the sugar deoxyribose and phosphate groups. The DNA polymers are those composed of repeating nucleotide units and, as disclosed herein, are capable of existing in the double helix configuration wherein the paired guanine cytosine G C and adenine thymine A T bases form hydrogen bonds stabilizing the double helix. DNA compounds are known to exist in all or essentially all living cells. These DNA compounds when incorporated into the expressed genetic material of cells, e.g., properly incorporated as elements of genes, plasmids, and chromosomes, are capable of transcribing onto messenger ribonucleic acid mRNA the ordered base pair sequences of the DNA. This process of transcription onto RNA is the process which enables polypeptide and or protein synthesis within living cells to be accomplished. The techniques of molecular biology now permit recombinant DNA compounds to be incorporated into the expressed genetic material of living cells for the purpose of transcribing onto messenger base pair RNA coding for pre selected polypeptides other than those which a cell might be capable of synthesizing prior to the incorporation or permit the cell to synthesize its natively produced polypeptides at much higher expression levels. Molecular biology research often begins by the isolation and characterization of DNA compounds from native sources. For example, a DNA compound has been isolated from the adult bovine pituitary which transcribes onto messenger RNA the base pair coding which directs the synthesis of bovine growth hormone or bGH. The isolation and characterization of this DNA compound is described in European published patent application 0112012, published 27 June 1984. Because this DNA compound was derived from the bovine pituitary gene responsible for bGH expression, such a compound is commonly referred to as genomic DNA or gDNA. In general, messenger RNA derived from this gDNA by transcription can then be copied into DNA utilizing reverse transcriptase enzymes. This copying of an RNA base sequence onto DNA yields a DNA compound commonly referred to as copy DNA or cDNA. For mammalian genes, the sequence of cDNA often differs from the sequence of gDNA coding for the same polypeptide or protein in that the gDNA often contains introns or non polypeptide coding sequences in addition to the codons. Refer, for example, to the known bGH gDNA containing four such introns between the 5 and 3 ends. Those ordered gDNA sequences with ordered counterparts on this mRNA transcribed therefrom are, accordingly, often referred to as exons . Genes capable of expression contain flanking sequences beyond the exons the portions of DNA that are transcribed onto messenger RNA which do not code for messenger RNA but are nonetheless essential to the transcription process. Upstream above the 5 end from the site where messenger RNA transcription begins is a DNA sequence responsible for promotion or initiation of transcription which is commonly referred to as the promoter . In most eukaryotic cells, a region of DNA downstream below the 3 end from the last exon is responsible for the addition to messenger RNA of a long sequence of adenine containing nucleotides which are added after transcription is completed. This region thus signals the addition of a DNA poly adenine tail , also known as the polyadenylation of the messenger RNA. For some proteins, certain of the requirements for this polyadenylation signal are known. See, for example, R.P. Woychik Further, the nucleotide sequence AATAAA characterises the polyadenylation signal at a location 11 to 30 nucleotides upstream towards the 5 end from the 3 end of the gene. Refer to D.R. Higgs EP A 0112012 identifies and characterises bGH gDNA. The present specification describes a method for utilising a bovine growth hormone bGH polyadenylation signal in conjunction with DNA, especially cDNA, coding for a pre selected polypeptide other than bGH as a means of obtaining expression of the pre selected polypeptide in a higher eukaryotic cell. According to the present invention, a recombinant DNA compound comprises a second nucleotide sequence comprising a non bGH gene and Preferably, the first sequence is a bGH sequence whose 5 end does not extend past the first PvuII site downstream from the fourth intron of the bGH gene and whose 3 end does not extend past the first EcoR1 site downstream from the said PstI site. More preferably, the 5 end is the PvuII site and the 3 end is the EcoRI site. An alternative preference is that the first sequence is a bGH sequence whose 5 end does not extend past the first PstI site upstream from the fourth intron of the bGH gene and whose 3 end is as defined above. Preferably, the 5 end is the PstI site and the 3 end is the EcoRI site. The first sequence may consist of the given bGH sequence. The second sequence may comprise tPAcDNA gene. The third sequence may comprise a CMV I.E. promoter. A compound of the invention may be part of the expressible genetic material in a higher eukaryotic cell or cell line, and as such may be used to express, for example, tPA, by culturing the cell or cell line. The present invention provides a bGH polyadenylation signal as a sequence of nucleotides whose functional centre is located at about the 3 end of the genomic bGH gene onto messenger RNA mRNA , is capable of signalling polyadenylation, i.e. the addition of a long chain or tail of adenine containing nucleotides, for the mRNA. Products of the invention incorporate such a polyadenylation signal in a recombinant DNA compound. Bovine growth hormone bGH is a 191 amino acid polypeptide, synthesised initially as a pre growth hormone containing a signal peptide of 26 amino acids. See Hunt, L.T. and Dayhoff, M.O. 1976 Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, ed. M.O. Dayhoff, National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, DC, Vol. 5, Suppl. 2, pp. 113 139 and Lingappa, V.R., Devillers Thiery, A. and Blobel, G. 1977 , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 74 2432 2436. Using recombinant DNA procedures, a bGH genomic clone is now known a genomic clone, designated pgGH2R2, is deposited in the permanent collection of the Northern Regional Research Laboratory NRRL , U.S. Department of Agriculture, Peoria, Illinois, U.S.A. It was deposited in an The bGH gDNA nucleotide sequence is known to be essentially the following nucleotides indicated by base A, T, G or C Lower case letters correspond to intron sequences. The mRNA transcription initiation and termination positions are designated above as 5 and 3 . Finally, recognition sites for the restriction endonuclease PstI and PvuII are noted above underlined , as well as the actual cleavage sites cleavage occurs between the double arrows . PstI cleaves nucleotides asymmetrically yielding a DNA compound whose end contains four unpaired bases corresponding to the TGCA sequence of bGH gDNA. When these sequences are removed by a T4 DNA polymerase, the result is a blunt ended DNA compound i.e., eliminating unpaired or sticky ended terminal residues . The effective or PstI Blunt ended cleavage site resulting is indicated by the downward arrows. Finally, the nucleotide sequence associated with polyadenylation, AATAAA is underlined. Within the parameters for the selection of a bGH polyadenylation signal as described above, the actual DNA compound comprising the signal can be prepared from bGH gDNA by cleavage with a known restriction endonuclease. Thereafter the DNA compound thereby prepared can be used as a signal after pruning or cleavage or several additional bGH polyadenylation nucleotides beyond those actually cleaved from the bGH gDNA by the restriction endonuclease. The techniques for using such exonucleases for accomplishing the pruning of DNA compounds are known in the art. See the references listed above. Alternatively, additional nucleotides may be added to a polyadenylation signal excised from bGH gDNA to create a larger polyadenylation signal which includes non genomic sequences. For example, if a genomic bGH gDNA sequence were obtained consisting of 50 nucleotides upstream and 50 nucleotides downstream from the 3 end, a non genomic DNA compound might be ligated either upstream or downstream thereof or both in order to obtain a substantially larger DNA compound comprising a bGH polyadenylation signal in accordance with the present invention. Finally, total or partial chemical synthesis is optionally employed to prepare any bGH polyadenylation signal described above. For convenience in synthesis and isolation, the preferred embodiment of a bGH polyadenylation signal according to the present invention is the product obtained cleavage of bGH gDNA by the PvuII restriction endonuclease of pλGH2R2. Alternatively, a somewhat longer bGH polyadenylation signal is conveniently obtained by digestion with PstI. The non bGH gene, in a DNA compound of the invention, is preferably a cDNA gene, although genomic DNA may be utilized instead, as well as other genes which contain introns or nucleotide sequences which do not code for amino acids. The selected polypeptide can include any polypeptide for which gene coding therefor is known or can be constructed by known techniques, i.e., partial or total chemical synthesis. Such polypeptides would, therefore, include proteins such as human serum albumin, the interferons and various analogs thereof, growth hormones other than bovine growth hormone, immunogenic proteins useful in vaccines, interleukin 2, and insulin. Most preferably, the non bGH gene is the tissue plasminogen activator tPA cDNA gene, to create a recombinant DNA molecule capable of expressing tPA in higher eukaryotic cells. The cloning and expression of human tissue plasminogen activator cDNA in E. coli is known and described in Nature 301 214 221 20 January 1983 . The known methods represent useful means of obtaining tPA cDNA. When the non bGH gene is from a genomic source, the third region of a compound of the invention may comprise a promoter already contained therewithin. Alternatively, and especially when the non bGH gene consists of cDNA, a distinct promoter is selected and incorporated from a number of useful promoters which are known and readily available in genetic engineering applications. These include the SV40 promoter See Journal of Molecular and Applied Genetics 1 327 341 and references cited therein and the LTR promoter See US A 4,405,712 . The preferred promoter in accordance with the present specification is the CMV I.E. promoter, most preferably the fragment thereof derived from the Sau3A restriction endonuclease. The restriction endonuclease cleavage maps of the region of the human cytomegalovirus CMV genome containing the major immediate early gene CMV I.E. have been described in detail Stinski, et al., J. Virol. 46 1 14, 1983 Stenberg, et al., J. Virol. 49 190 199, 1984 Thomsen, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81 659 663, 1984 . These references describe a 2.0 kilobase PstI fragment which contains the promoter for the major immediate early gene. When this 2.0 kb PstI fragment is isolated and digested with Sau3AI, a 760 base pair fragment is obtained among the products. This 760 base pair fragment can be distinguished from the other products by its size and the presence of a SacI cleavage site and a BalI cleavage site within the fragment. Because of its convenient identification, utilization of this Sau3AI fragment is the preferred method of use of the CMV I.E. promoter as described in the present specification. If desired, a compound of the invention may include a selectable marker which can be utilized to determine whether the recombinant DNA compound has been incorporated into the expressed genetic material of a living cell. The use of such markers and the principles of selectivity therefor are well known and well recognized in the art. Selectable markers include antibiotic resistance genes which are useful to determine incorporation into those living cells towards whom the antibiotic is otherwise lethal. In mammalian cells, for example, the aminoglycoside antibiotic G418 results in inhibition of protein synthesis and death of the cell. Accordingly, the G418 resistance gene comprises a suitable selectable marker. Similarly, the dihydrofolate reductase dhfr gene provides a useful marker for cells e.g., Chinese hamster ovary cells which can be prepared dhfr deficient. Another technique for selection which does not require the utilization of a marker on the DNA compound of formula I is the use of co transference techniques whereby both the formula I compound absent a marker and a separate DNA molecule containing the marker are co transfered into a cell. See US A 4,399,216, issued to the University of Columbia. Incorporation into the expressed genetic material of a higher eukoryotic cell is accomplished by known means. Typically the incorporation will result in the presence of a DNA compound in the chromosomal structure of the cell, but may also be accomplished by an extra chromosomal incorporation, e.g., utilization of a recombinant bovine papilloma virus. See N. Hsiung, et al., J. Molecular and Applied Genetics 2 497 506 1984 for the methodology for such incorporation. Although the compound of formula I is depicted as a circular recombinant DNA molecule, acircular forms thereof exist as a result of cleavage, e.g., at specific sites by restriction endonucleases and more randomly by other nucleases and the like. The present specification provides both the circular and acircular recombinant DNA compounds as characterized above. The present specification also provides the use of the formula I recombinant DNA compound for the expression of a pre selected polypeptide. This use is accomplished by inserting the recombinant DNA compound into the expressed genetic material of a higher eukoryotic cell or cell line. These higher eukoryotes in accordance with the present invention consists of cells and cell lines derived from multicellular organisms, especially mammalian cells and cell lines. Culturing these cells or cell lines in accordance with known techniques then yields the pre selected polypeptide, e.g., tissues plasminogen activator or tPA. The present invention accordingly provides a novel use for a bGH polyadenylation signal in recombinant constructs prepared therewith. The charts herein further describe the construction and operation of the present invention. Because plasmids are circular DNA, for convenience they are often represented as circles. However, the present specification, including the charts and formulas, employs an alternative representation of plasmids, essentially as rectangles whose horizontal sides represent the DNA nucleotides of the plasmid and whose two vertical sides each represent a regular phosphodiester bond which links together the bridging nucleotides represented on each of the horizontal sides. Further, the vertical sides comprise directional arrows which indicate the direction of transcription for the plasmid represented. In translating the rectangular representations of plasmids to a circular representation, the left side of the rectangle most conveniently will correspond to the uppermost point on the circle. Thus, the right side of the rectangle will correspond to the lowermost point on the circle. Vertical lines on either of the horizontal sides of the rectangular representation corresponds to cleavage sites for restriction endonucleases or the location of the initiation or termination of a specified nucleotide sequence. The specified nucleotide sequences may also be further characterized by alphabetical characters which appear above a horizontal line. Similarly, the location of cleavage sites for restriction endonucleases is depicted as noted by arrows and the standard abbreviations for these enzymes. One advantage of the system for representing plasmids as utilized herein is that linear segments of DNA are depicted exactly as the circular plasmids except that one or both of the vertical sides of the rectangle are deleted. When both vertical sides are omitted, the DNA will be represented by a single horizontal line whose direction of replication will be separately indicated by horizontal directional arrows, as appropriate. Thus, in the present specification whenever a DNA compound, i.e., a polymeric deoxyribonucleic acid wherein the sequence nucleotides thereof are selected from the group adenine A , thymine T , cytosine C , and guanine G , is depicted partially by a horizontal line. The line represents either a regular phosphodiester bond or discrete number of DNA residues. Unless these residues are further characterized or specified, e.g., by reference to the nucleotide sequence of a gene, promoter, marker, or endonuclease restriction enzyme site, the residues may be arbitrarily composed, subject only to the known limitations on size, location, and proximity to functionalized and or characterized sequences of these uncharacterized intervening sequences. In other words, these intervening sequences must not negate the suitability of the resulting DNA compound for its intended purpose. More preferably, however, the intervening sequences will contain preselected and useful nucleotide sequences which will further enhance the intended purpose e.g., enhance expression levels of a preselected polypeptide or will permit selection in a broader range of hosts e.g., by inclusion of antibiotic resistance genes . Hence, as represented herein by formula, the DNA compounds optionally include sequences of nucleotides having structural and or functional characteristics in addition to those expressly designated. With respect to these charts, Chart A provides a generalized method for the preparation of formula DNA compounds. In accordance with Chart A, a plasmid pX containing nucleotides coding for a preselected polypeptide is digested with restriction endonucleases arbitrarily designated as ResI and ResII in the chart to yield a formula II DNA compound containing essentially the desired ordered codons for the polypeptide. The formula II is, for example, preferably a cDNA compound coding for the polypeptide. When not conveniently available from a plasmid such as pX, total or partial chemical synthetic methods may be employed for constructing the Formula II compound. Similarly, for formula II compounds lacking convenient restriction endonuclease sites, chemical modification by known methods is employed to arrive at the, formula II compound. The next construction in accordance with Chart A is the preparation of a formula III DNA compound containing a suitable marker. Accordingly, the plasmid pM with restriction endonuclease sites arbitrarily designated as ResII and ResIII are digested to yield a formula III compound containing a selectable marker. The recombination of the formula II and formula III DNA compounds is then undertaken to yield a formula V DNA compound. In order to incorporate a bGH polyadenylation signal into the formula V compound, a plasmid pBGH, containing bGH gDNA is digested with restriction endonucleases arbitrarily designated as ResIII and ResIV. This yields the formula IV DNA compound containing a bGH polyadenylation signal. Depending upon the exact ResIV which is selected, the formula IV DNA compound will include an intron from the bGH gDNA. Optionally the product of digestion of plasmid pBGH with the restriction endonucleases may be further modified by digestion with other nucleases to yield formula IV polyadenylation signals. Alternatively, of course, the formula IV compound may simply be derived by total or partial chemical synthesis by known methods. Ligation of the formula IV and formula V compounds will then yield a formula VI plasmid which when digested with an appropriate restriction endonuclease, here ResII and ligated to a promoter yields the DNA compound of Formula I. The order of the assembly of the DNA compounds representing the components of the formula I compound is in general not critical and may be accomplished in whatever order is most convenient based on available starting materials, etc. Accordingly, the method of Chart A, as well as the succeeding charts, may be modified to reflect variation in the order of assembly. Chart B provides a convenient method for the preparation of a plasmid useful in obtaining a bGH polyadenylation signal for use in the preparation of the formula I DNA compound. In accordance with Chart B, the plasmid pSV2dHR is digested with the appropriate endonucleases as indicated in Chart B, to yield the formula VI DNA compound containing the ampicillin resistance gene designated as Amp on Chart B the SV40 origin and associated promoters, as well as the mouse dihydrofolate reductase dhfr gene. A description of the preparation and use of this plasmid is described by S. Subramani, et al., Expression of the Mouse Dihydrofolate Reductase Complementary Deoxyribonucleic Acid in Simian Virus 40 , Molecular and Cellular Biology 2 854 864 Sept. 1981 . Similarly, with respect to Chart B, the plasmid pλGH2R2 is digested with the same restriction endonucleases, as identified in Chart B, to yield the formula VII DNA compound containing bGH gDNA. The plasmid pλGH2R2 is derived from an E. coli HB101 host, NRRL Deposit Number B 15154. This plasmid is known in the art and readily produced by methods known in the art. See European published application 83306655.8, published on 27 June 1984. The formula VI and Formula VII DNA compounds are then ligated to yield pSVCOW7 formula XI . Chart C describes the use of plasmid pSVCOW7 in the preparation of DNA compounds, the formula XII formula XIV compounds, which are then useful in the synthesis of the formula X and formula XII compounds of Chart E. Thus, Chart C describes the preparation of the various formula XII, XIII and XIV compounds by digestion with restriction endonucleases as described in the chart. With respect to the formula XIV compound, the digestion with the EcoRI and PstI endonucleases is followed by the action of DNA polymerase at the PstI site in order to yield a Blunt ended or fully base paired formula XIV compound. Also on Chart C, the preparation of tPA cDNA from the plasmid pPSA18 is described. The preparation of this formula XV plasmid is described in the preferred embodiments, including a detailed description of the modifications resulting in the BamHI and BalI restriction nucleases at, respectively, the regions coding for the end terminal amino acids at the BamHI site. The formula XIII and formula XIV compounds represent useful bGH polyadenylation signals in accordance with the present invention. The nucleotide sequences for these formula XIII and formula XIV compounds respectively comprise the ordered sequence set forth above for bGH gDNA from the PvuII cleavage site or the PstI Blunt ended cleavage site through the end of the bases identified above for bGH gDNA. Chart D provides the method whereby two plasmids are constructed, pTPA IPA dhfr and pTPA PA dhfr which respectively contain either the polyadenylation signal of formula XIV or of formula XIII. By the method of Chart D, the Formula XII compound prepared in Chart C is ligated to the formula XVI compound of Chart C to yield a DNA compound which is then ligated either to the formula XIV polyadenylation signal or the formula XIII polyadenylation signal, respectively. The resulting products represent the intron containing bGH polyadenylation signal of formula XVII and the compound of formula XVIII whose bGH polyadenylation signal does not contain this intron. Chart E describes the method by which the formula X and formula XII compounds containing useful promoters are prepared. In accordance with Chart E, the CMV I.E. promoter a 760 base pair fragment obtained by digestion with the endonuclease Sau3AI is ligated with the DNA compound produced by digestion of the formula XVII compound with the restriction endonuclease BamHI, followed by treatment with bacterial alkaline phosphotase. The resulting formula X compound represents a species within the scope of the formula I DNA compounds described in the present specification. Analogously, Chart E also describes the preparation of the formula XII compound when the formula XVIII compound is utilized in place of the formula XVII compound as a starting material. By the general and specific methods described above, various circular recombinant DNA compounds of formula I are prepared by known and standard techniques in molecular biology. All of these formula I compounds may also be prepared in acircular form wherein cleavage of a phosphodiester bond has been accomplished utilizing one of the known nucleases. These recombinant DNA compounds of formula I are usefully employed in the synthesis of a pre selected polypeptide by incorporation into the expressed genetic material of a higher eukoryotic cell or cell line. As described above, this incorporation into the expressed genetic material of a higher eukoryotic cell or cell line is accomplished by methods known in the art, including, for example, transfection of a formula I compound. Once the expressed genetic material of the higher eukoryotic cell or cell line comprises the formula I compound, known techniques for culturing such cell lines are employed in order to obtain expression of the pre selected polypeptide. The pre selected polypeptides so expressed are then recovered from the cell culture by conventional means. Each pre selected polypeptide then can be used to accomplish known pharmacological uses therefor by known means. Alternatively, polypeptides are known to be nutritionally useful. The present invention is more completely understood through the operation of the following preparations and examples. All methods herein for synthesis of DNA compounds, including plasmid construction are standard techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in molecular biology reserch. The techniques have, for example, been compiled in Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual by T. Maniatis, et al., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1982. Refer to Chart B. The plasmid pSV2dhfr prepared according to the procedure of S. Subramani, Molecular and Cellular Biology 2 854 864 Sept. 1981 is digested with BamHI and EcoRI to yield the fragment containing the ampicillin resistance gene, the SV40 origin, and the dhfr gene. The other fragment from plasmid pλGH2R2 digested with the same restriction endonucleases represents DNA containing the genomic bovine growth hormone gene, i.e., bGH gDNA. pλGH2R2 is obtained from an E. coli HB101 host, NRRL B 15154. This resulting formula VII bGH gDNA fragment is then ligated with the formula VI compound to yield the formula XI plasmid pSVCOW7. Refer to Chart C. A full length cDNA clone of human tissue plasminogen activator tPA is obtained or prepared. Methods known in the art are utilized, e.g., Pennica, et al., Nature 301 214 221 20 January 1983 , for preparing tPA cDNA. The tPA cDNA is then cut with the restriction endonuclease HgaI and the ends treated with the DNA polymerase I klenow fragment. BamHI linkers are then ligated to the HgaI ends. The resulting cDNA is then cleaved with the restriction endonuclease NarI and the 490 base pair fragment is isolated which contains the coding sequences for the N terminal amino acids of tPA. This DNA compound exhibits one NarI end and one HgaI end with the previously coupled BamHI linker. In a separate reaction, tPA cDNA is digested with both NarI and BglII. A 1650 base pair NarI BglII fragment is isolated which contains the coding sequences for the C terminal amino acids of tPA. The N terminal and C terminal fragments isolated above are then ligated to plasmid pKC7 prepared by the method of Rao, et al., Gene 7 79 82, 1979 to yield the title plasmid pPSA18. This plasmid exhibits the entire coding region for tPA, with a unique BamHI cleavage site in the 5 untranslated region of the coding region. The assembly of the tPA expressing plasmids is accomplished in two steps as indicated below Both plasmids derived in Step 2 Example 1 above are transfected into Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells deficient in dihydrofolate reductase dhfr using conventional transfection techniques. This cell line is mutant DXB 11 from L. Chasin, Columbia University Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 4216 4220, 1980 . The above methods for transfection utilizes calcium phosphate transfection of DNA into cells described in detail by Graham, et al. in Introduction of Macromolecules into Viable Mammalian cells, Alan R. Liss Inc., N.Y., 1980, pp. 3 25 . Cells which incorporate the transfected plasmids are selected based on dhfr deficiency by growth in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium plus proline. Although the Chinese ovary cells are especially adapted for use with a plasmid such as those formula X and formula XII compounds constructed above, the use of the CMV I.E. promoter and bGH polyadenylation site in the tPA gene expression does not depend on use of the dhfr marker on these plasmids. Expression or cDNA genes is also obtained with different selectable markers, such as gene which confers resistance to antibiotic G418 J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1 327 341, 1982 and in other cell lines with an alternate marker replacing the dhfr marker. Accordingly such a replacement permits the use of many different cell lines as hosts for the plasmids. From the cells transfected with pIETPA PAdhfr, clones are isolated, which, when grown in a monolayer for two days, synthesize at least 100 ng tPA per million cells. From cells with pIETPA IPA dhfr, clones are isolated which synthesize at least 10 ng tPA per million cells. Accordingly, the present specification provides a method for obtaining the necessary polyadenylation of messenger RNA, especially for transcription from cDNA genes coding for the pre selected polypeptide. This permits the use of such cDNA genes for expression in higher eukoryotic cells and particularly provides such expression in surprisingly and unexpectedly high yield. In addition to the preferred embodiments set forth hereinabove, most preferably the bGH polyadenylation signal consists of the following nucleotide sequence and any functional equivalent thereof. By functional equivalent is meant a compound comprising the above identified nucleotide sequence which performs biologically in substantially the same manner as the compound represented by the above identified nucleotide sequence but wherein one or more nucleotides have been modified, e.g., by substitution of one nucleotide for another. This most preferred embodiment can be prepared by the general procedures described hereinabove, i.e., by digestion of the bGH gDNA and or by chemical synthesis. The bGH polyadenylation signal of Formula L was obtained as follows. Plasmid pSVB3 Ba containing a 2.2 kb Bam HI EcoRI restriction fragment containing the entire bovine growth hormone gene along with 400 bp of its 3 flanking sequence was constructed as described in PNAS The sizes of the deletions were determined by Sanger dideoxy sequencing. The accuracy of polyadenylation for each deletion mutant was determined by the transfection of Cos 1 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation followed by Sl mapping of the transiently expressed A RNAs. The efficiency of polyadenylation for each deletion as compared to wild type pSVB3 Ba was roughly determined by Northern Blot analysis of the same A RNAs. As represented by formula L the polyadenylation signal which accurately and efficiently directs polyadenylation consists of 52 nucleotides and includes 10 nucleotides upstream the AATAAA hexanucleotide through 18 nucleotides downstream the polyadenylation site. In formula L the hexanucleotide and polyadenylation site are underlined. When in the procedure of Example 1A, fragments 1 and 2 are ligated with the nucleotide sequence of formula L a plasmid identified as pTPA 52PA dhfr formula XL which contains the tPA cDNA is obtained which has the 52 nucleotide base pair polyadenylation region of formula L ligated to its 3 end. When in the procedures of Example 1B the above obtained plasmid is substituted for the plasmids of formula XVII and XVIII the plasmid pIETPA 52PA dhfr formula XLI is obtained which contains the tPA cDNA with the CMV promoter on the 5 end and the 52 base nucleotide bGH polyadenylation signal of formula L on its 3 end. When the plasmid of Formula XLI is substituted for the plasmids of formula XI and XII in the procedures of Example 2 and Example 3 and the general procedure thereof followed expression of tPA is achieved.
