## Description
The invention relates to a method for etching openings with a controlled wall profile in a layer of material. In the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuit devices vias or openings are formed in an insulating layer prior to metallization to provide contacts to underlying regions. It is preferable that these openings have a rounded profile in order to minimize the possibility of defects in the overlying metal layer. One problem is a step coverage defect, which sometimes occurs when a metal layer is formed over an opening having a steep profile and causes a discontinuity in the conductor formed by the metal layer. Such steep openings, that is, openings having nearly vertical sidewalls, typically occur when an insulating layer is anisotropically etched, for example by a plasma or reactive ion etching process. The insulating layer via profile becomes more important as the number of metal interconnection layers increases and the thickness of each metal layer decreases One method for providing an opening having a sloped profile is to form a predetermined slope in the sidewalls of the openings in a mask layer overlying the insulating layer to be etched. The sidewall profile in the mask layer, typically a photoresist, is then transferred to the opening in the insulating layer during the etching process. A disadvantage is that this method requires an extra high temperature bake step to form the desired opening profile in the mask layer. This step to obtain a predetermined slope in the mask layer is not easily controlled, thus resulting in an etch profile that is difficult to repeat from wafer to wafer. Another method of providing a sloped sidewall profile during anisotropic plasma or reactive ion etching is to vary the ion bombardment energy. However, this requires a complex triode or a flexible diode reactor and it is often difficult to precisely control the profile. The prior art teaches various methods of tailoring the reactive etchant species used in plasma etching to achieve a particular etch rate and selectivity relative to the layer being etched, the underlying layer and the photoresist mask layer. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,174,251 to Paschke describes a two step etching process for a low pressure plasma reactor wherein a silicon nitride layer is etched through a photoresist mask without destroying the mask layer. The process includes a pre etch step using a high plasma power level and a 95 5 CF₄ 0₂ etchant gas to etch halfway through the silicon nitride layer, followed by a main etch step at a lower power level, using a 50 50 CF₄ 0₂ etchant gas to etch the remainder of the silicon nitride layer. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 20, No. 4, September 1977 discloses a method for sidewall tailoring of openings using two different reactive ion etchants in succession. From D.HG. Choe et al., Production RIE I. Selective Dielectric Etching, Solid State Technology, April 1984, pages 177 183, it is known to accomplish a sloped profile of contact holes etched in phosphosilicate glasses or silicon dioxide layers by means of a CHF₃ O₂ plasma, thereby varying the oxygen flow rate. U.S. Patent No. 3,940,506 to Heinecke discloses a method of adjusting the concentration of a reducing species, such as hydrogen, in a plasma to control the relative etch rates of silicon and silicon dioxide or silicon nitride, particularly for use in a low pressure plasma reactor. Hydrogen is used to control the selectivity and may be added to the CF₄ etchant gas mixture by using a partially fluorine substituted hydrocarbon such as CHF₃. U.S. Patent No. 4,324,611 to Vogel et al. describes a method for tailoring a reagent gas mixture to achieve a high etch rate, high selectivity and low breakdown of photoresist in a single wafer, high power, high pressure reactor. The disclosed reagent gas mixture includes a primary etching gas consisting of a pure carbon fluorine, and a secondary gas containing hydrogen to control the selectivity of the etch. A tertiary gas containing helium may be included to prevent the breakdown of the photoresist mask layer. In one embodiment for plasma etching silicon dioxide or silicon nitride overlying silicon, the primary gas is C₂F₆ and the secondary gas is CHF₃. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for controlling the profile of an etched opening in layer of material. Another object of the invention is to provide a method for plasma etching an insulating layer to provide an opening having a desired profile. Preferably the wall profile of opening is controlled during plasma etching by changing the percentage gas concentration of the etching species at least at one predetermined point during the etching process. Advantageously the layer to be etched comprises an insulating material, like silicon dioxide, and said mask layer comprises a photoresist, like a hydrocarbon photoresist. For forming an opening in a silicon dioxide layer having a shallow sloped sidewall in its upper portion and a steep sloped sidewall in its lower portion, the silicon oxide layer is etched through a hydrocarbon photoresist mask layer where at the beginning of the etching in a mixture of CF₄ and CHF₃ a high initial percentage gas concentration of CHF₃ is selected to achieve a high silicon dioxide photoresist etch rate ratio and after etching through a portion of the silicon dioxide layer, the percentage gas concentration of the CHF₃ is decreased to decrease the silicon dioxide photoresist etch rate ratio. Other advantageous embodiments of the inventive method are disclosed in the subclaims. The inventive method will become more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein It has been found, in the reactive etching of an insulating layer such as silicon dioxide that when pure CF₄ gas is employed as the reactive species there is no undercutting of a hydrocarbon HC photoresist. Also, the etch rate ratio of silicon dioxide to HC photoresist is approximately 0.97 1. Further, when a secondary gas such as CHF₃ is added to the CF₄ the etch rate ratio increases, as shown in Fig. 1. The actual etch rates of silicon dioxide and the HC photoresist are plotted in Fig. 2 as a function of the gas concentration in CHF₃, expressed as a percentage of the CHF₃ CF₄ mixture. As shown, the etch rate of silicon dioxide varies over a relatively small range while the etch rate of the HC photoresist substantially decreases as CHF₃ is added to the etchant gas mixture. As the silicon dioxide photoresist SiO₂ HC etch rate ratio is varied, as shown in Fig. 3, the sidewall slope angle of the final etched opening in the silicon dioxide layer also varies. Thus, a low SiO₂ HC etch rate ratio results in a small sidewall slope angle with respect to the horizontal, i.e., a shallow etched opening profile, whereas a high etch rate ratio results in a large sidewall slope angle or a steep etched opening profile. Referring now to Figs. 4A and 4B, the relationship between the percentage CHF₃ concentration in the etchant gas and the slope angle of the etched opening sidewall is used to control the opening profile. Figure 4A shows a portion of an insulating layer 10, for example, silicon dio xide which may be formed on a silicon body not shown or other underlying layer. Included in layer 10, for purposes of illustration, is a conductor 12 which may be a portion of a metallic interconnection layer. Overlying layer 10 is a mask layer 14, for example, a hydrocarbon photoresist, including mask openings 16 through which layer 10 will be etched. Mask opening 16 can be formed by any of a number of well known processes. Fig 4B shows layer 10 after the completion of the present etching process wherein an opening 18 has been formed. The upper sidewall portion 20 of opening 18 is formed by using an etchant having a high percentage CHF₃ gas concentration during the initial phase of the etching process. Referring again to Figs. 1 and 3, the etchant has a high etch rate ratio of SiO₂ HC and therefore causes sidewall portion 20 to initially have a high slope angle with respect to the horizontal. In other words, a smaller thickness of the photoresist layer 14 is etched as compared to the thickness of the SiO₂ layer 10 etched during the initial etching phase. After a portion, for example, one half, of layer 10 has been etched the percentage CHF₃ gas concentration is decreased. The etch rate ratio is similarly decreased resulting in a high final slope angle for the lower sidewall portion 22 of opening 18 as compared to upper portion 20. That is, since a greater thickness of photoresist layer 14 is etched than during the initial etching phase, a larger surface area of SiO₂ layer 10 will be uncovered during the final etching phase, causing the upper portion 20 of layer 10 to have a shallower final etched slope than the lower portion 22. In the example shown in Fig. 4B, the etching process is completed when the upper surface of conductor 12 is fully exposed. As an illustrative example of the present process, a silicon wafer having a 2.0 µm SiO₂ layer thereon was etched through a 2000 nm diameter opening in a photoresist layer approximately 1500 nm thick. The process was carried out in a single wafer, planar plasma reactor at an RF frequency of about 13.56 MHz., an RF power of about 200 watts and a pressure of about 1.33 mbar. The initial CHF₃ gas concentration was about 25 , and the final CHF₃ gas concentration was about 5 , resulting in a lower sidewall slope of about 85 degrees and an upper sidewall slope of about 30 degrees. The entire etching process took approximately two minutes. This process is particularly adaptable to single wafer, high pressure plasma reactors having a relatively small plasma chamber volume, for example, less than about 40 ccm. The small chamber volume results in a low residence time and permits the precise control of the opening profile, since a change in CHF₃ concentration causes an extremely fast change in the etch rate ratio. Under the above described process conditions this change has been observed to occur in less than 0.5 seconds. Since the etchant gas concentration is changed abruptly during the etch cycle, a slight discontinuity in the etched profile is observed. Although this will not affect step coverage during subsequent metal deposition, the discontinuity can be avoided and the smoothly varying profile as shown in FIG. 4B can be achieved by continuously varying the CHF₃ concentration. This can be readily carried out by using, for example, a microprocessor or an analog control loop. There has thus been provided by the present invention a reactive plasma etching process wherein the profile of an opening formed in an insulating layer may be precisely controlled, regardless of the original slope in the mask layer.
