# MODIFIED REGENERATED CELLULOSE MEMBRANE FOR NON AQUEOUS SEPARATIONS

## Abstract
Regenerated Cellulose membranes used for the separa tion of organic liquids, for example, ketone dewaxing solvents from dewaxed oil or NMP extraction solvents from extract, have their solute rejection capability enhanced by chemical modification by contacting said membrane with a bifunctional reagent that is reactive with the hydroxy groups in the anhydroglucose units of the regenerated cellulose polymer. The reaction of the bifunctional reagent with the hydroxy groups in the polymer results in the crosslinking of the polymer which, in turn, results in the improvement of the membrane s selectivity in organic liquid separations applica tions.
