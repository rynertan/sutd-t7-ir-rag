## Description
This invention relates to eyeglass frames, and a method of assembling same. More particularly, the invention is in the field of eyeglass frames which are easily and quickly assembled. The majority of eyeglass frames manufactured today include a lens supporting structure to which two temples are pivotably attached by means of a hinge assembly. The hinges can be metal or plastic, and a pin secures the hinge of the lens support to the hinge of the temple. The hinges are glued, screwed or fastened by some other means to the lens support and temple. Assembly of such frames utilizing metal or plastic hinges with a screw or pin assembly requires a number of manufacturing steps which complicates the assembly proces. Other eyeglass frames, like the one disclosed in US A 4 084 889 by Visher, published April 18, 1978, use a spring assisted hinge assembly. A forwardly extending hinge portion of a temple member is removably inserted in an integral hinge socket of a lens supporting structure. Eyeglass frames are also manufactured using other known pivoting connecting assemblies which provide free movement of the temples from the lens supporting structure. The basic requirement for any pivoting connector assembly is that the temple movement be made easily and the pivoting assembly be strong and reliable. The principal problem with all known assemblies, as in the case of the hinge assemblies described above, is that the assemblies are rather complex. This complexity results in added hardware costs as well as added assembly costs. In addition, some of these assemblies provide inadequate strength and reliability. It is therefore a principal object of the present invention to provide as eyeglass frame which is easily and quickly assembled. This object is solved by the eyeglass frame according to the main claim. Advantageous features of the eyeglass frame are evident from subclaims 2 to 10. A further object of the invention is to provide an easy and quick method of assembling an eyeglass frame. This object is solved according to claim 11. Further advantageous features of this method are evident from subclaim 12. The present invention allows production of an eyeglass frame the components of which can be inexpensively manufactured. The present invention also provides an eyeglass frame which is strong and reliable. According to the invention an eyeglass frame and a method of assembling such a frame is provided in which the temple of the eyeglass frame includes a first extension portion projecting from the temple. This first extension portion includes a means to support a pin around which the temple pivots. A temple receiving member of a lens supporting structure includes upper and lower walls, the facing surfaces of which include a ramped slot. The first extension portion of the temple with the pin inserted in the pin support is aligned with the temple receiving member so that the pin slides through the ramped slots. As the temple portion is pushed further through the slots, the upper and lower walls of the temple receiving member separate until the pin falls into a pin capturing hole in the temple receiving member where it locks thereby pivotably securing the temple to the supporting structure. In an alternate embodiment, a spring loaded pin is employed, at least one end of which depresses to allow the pin to pass through the slots. These and other features and objects of the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment which should be read in light of the accompanying drawings. In accordance with the present invention, the eyeglass frame 10, shown in Fig. 1, includes a lens supporting structure 12 and two temples 14,14 . An integral temple receiving member 13 extends in a generally perpendicular direction from each end of the lens supporting structure 12, and a temple 14 is pivotably connected to each of the temple receiving members 13. The temples 14, 14 pivot between an open position which enables a user to wear the eyeglasses and support the temples with his ears and a closed position which allows the eyeglasses to be stored. In Fig. 1 temple 14 is in a closed position and temple 14 is in an open position. The frame hinge assembly of the present invention, shown in Fig. 2, enables a temple 14 to be easily and quickly secured to the lens supporting structure 12. The end of temple 14, which in an assembled frame is interconnected with temple receiving member 13, includes a first extension portion 16 designed to fit within a first slot formed between top 18 and bottom 20 inner walls of the temple receiving member 13. Extending from this first extension portion 16 is a second extension portion 22 which is designed to fit within a second slot created between upper 24 and lower 26 outer walls of the temple receiving member 13. In the preferred embodiment, the first slot has a smaller depth than the temple 14 and the second slot has a depth smaller than the first slot. The temple 14 is fabricated so that the first extension portion 16 includes a pin receiving hole in which a pin 28 is inserted. This hole runs from the upper surface 30 of the first extension portion 16 to the lower surface 32 of the first extension portion 16 so that a pin may extend from both the upper and lower surfaces 30, 32 of the first extension portion 16. The interior upper 34 and lower 36 surfaces of the temple receiving member 13 include a ramped slot 34 , 36 , with the distance between opposed, ramped surfaces of the slots 34 , 36 decreasing from the end 13a of temple receiving member 13 furthest from the position where a lens is supported to the pin receiving hole 40 of the temple receiving member 13. At the end 13a of the temple receiving member 13, the ramped surfaces are separated from each other a distance greater than the length of pin 28. In operation, the pin 28 is positioned so that the top end of the pin 28 slides into the upper slot 34 and the lower portion of the pin 28 slides into lower slot 36 . The temple 14, held in an open position as shown in a solid line in Fig. 5, is pushed towards the lens supporting structure 12 thereby forcing the upper and lower surfaces 34, 36 of the temple receiving member 13 apart from each other. As the temple 14 is forced closer to the lens supporting structure 12, surfaces 34, 36 continue to be separated from each other until the pin 28 falls into pin receiving hole 40 at which point the surfaces 34, 36 collapse to substantially meet the surfaces 30, 32 of the first extension portion 16 of the temple 14. The pin 28 is then locked in hole 40. To facilitate assembly, the temple 14 may be pivoted into contact with temple angular position limiting wall 19 once the temple 14 has been partially inserted into the temple receiving member 13. As shown in phantom in Fig. 5, this pivoting action forces the pin 28 towards the pin receiving hole 40. With the pin locked in hole 40, the frame of the present invention provides a very strong hinge since the temple can only be separated from the lens supporting structure 12 by forcing apart the upper and lower surfaces 34, 36 of the temple receiving member 13. Under normal use, such a forcing apart is virtually impossible. The temple angular position limiting wall 19 integrally positioned between the upper and lower outside walls 24, 26 operates to limit the movement of the temple 14 in both the open and closed position. As shown in Fig. 6 the temple 14 pivots from an open to closed position making contact in both the open and closed position with temple limiting wall 19. The lens supporting structure 12 and the temples 14 are preferably fabricated from a polymer, particularly cellulose acetate propionate. The lens supporting structure 12 and or the temples 14 may, however, be metal parts. When the lens supporting structure 12 is fabricated from a metal, the metal should be such that it will flex under the force of the pin 28 so as to allow the forcing apart of the upper and lower surfaces 34, 36 of the temple 14. It is also possible, however, to utilize a stiffer metal. Such a frame utilizes a pin 42 having at least one spring loaded insert 44 which depresses the spring 46 when the temple 14 is urged through the temple receiving member 13. When the pin reaches the pin receiving hole 40, the spring 46 forces the inserts 44 outwardly from the pin housing 48 thereby locking the pin in the pin receiving hole 40. Obviously, the length of pin 42 must be greater than the closest distance between the upper and lower surfaces 34, 36 of the temple receiving member 13. The eyeglass frame and assembly method taught by the present invention provides a sturdy and reliable eyeglass frame which is easily and quickly produced without a complex hinge assembly. As a result, both manufacturing and assembling costs are kept to a minimum thereby making the eyeglass frame a very appealing alternative to prior art eyeglass frame structures. While the invention has been described with reference to its preferred embodiment, it is understood that various modifications and alterations will occur to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and the drawings.
