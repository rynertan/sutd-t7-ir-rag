# SLURRY AGITATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Slurry agitating apparatus comprising a jib 30 pivoted at one end to a frame 31 which is adapted to be pivotally connected to and supported by a prime mover 20 . The other end of the jib 30 supports a probe 10 which depends vertically therefrom. Mounted on the free end of the probe 10 is a slurry agitating device 12 which is operative ly connected to the prime mover 20 . The axis of rotation of the agitating device 12 is perpendicular to the probe 10 . The construction is such that on pivotal movement of the jib 30 , in response to pivotal movement of the frame 31 , the probe 10 is vertically raised out of or lowered into a slurry reservoir through an access aperture.
