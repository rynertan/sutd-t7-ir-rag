# Dressing liquid filling unit for vacuum packaging machines.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a dressing liquid filling unit, for vacuum packaging and the like machines. A problem currently encountered with conventional vacuum packaging machines is that these machines are usually excessively noisy and so constructed as to result in serious wear problems. The above technical problem is solved by a dressing liquid filling unit for vacuum packaging machines, compris ing a valving member 2 for the introduction of dressing liquid, formed by a lower body 5 sealingly associable with a can 4 or the like, and an upper body 6 which is connected to the lower body 5 and pivotable relatively thereto to take a variety of operational positions. The rotation of the upper body 6 with respect to the lower one 5 is accomplished through a cam following element which is connected to a rod 30 extending axially from the upper body 6 , which engages with a camming path correspondingly arranged along the processing path followed by cans 4 to be filled.
