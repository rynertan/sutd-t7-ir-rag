# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING L GLUTAMIC ACID BY FERMENTATION

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for producing L glutamic acid, the process involves culturing a microorganism having an ability to produce L glutamic acid in a nutrient medium until L glutamic acid is accumulated in the culture liquor and recovering the L glutamic acid therefrom. The process is characterized by using a mutant obtained by the technology of protoplast fusion or a mutant having a resistance to two or more antibiotics. Also disclosed are novel microorganisms for use therein.
