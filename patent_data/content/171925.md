# Hand held scanning device.

## Abstract
A hand held scanning device 20 has a sensing unit 26 consisting of a first linear array 30 of light emitting diodes LEDs 32 spaced from and parallel to a second linear array 34 of photosensitive element integrated circuits 36 . The LEDs 32 and integrated circuits 36 are mounted on a common substrate 60 facing an opening in bottom surface 24 of housing 22 . A roller 28 is parallel to the sensing unit 26 . A wheel 82 containing light and dark areas is positioned to be rotated by the roller 28 . The roller 28 assures that the scanning device 20 travels in a straight line path when it is moved along a sheet of paper. The light and dark areas of the wheel 82 are sensed to define line scans of the device 20 and uniform light exposure by the LEDs 32 on the basis of distance travelled along the sheet of paper. A light collimating fiber optic plate 67 is positioned over each integrated circuit 36 .
