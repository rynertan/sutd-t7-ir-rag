## Description
LIGATING CLIP AND CLIP APPLIERThe present invention relates to ligating clips and more particularly to ligating clips fabricated from biocompatible polymeric materials with said clips being of a large size to be used for ligating vascular tissue such as the broad ligament, colonic mesenteries and similar vascular connective tissue.Background of the InventionIn many surgical procedures, it is often necessary to ligate a plurality of vessels within the surgical site.The vessels may then be severed downstream of the ligated portion. The primary reason for ligating vessels is to maintain the surgical site free of an excess of blood and to reduce blood loss in the patient. Generally, most of these vessels are individual vessels or vessels that can be readily dissected from adjoining tissue so that a small ligating clip may be placed about the vessel to shut it off. Such clips, which may be either a metal clip or a polymeric clip, are used as a substitute for a ligature or a thread which a surgeon would use to tie around the vessel. The clips substituted for such ligatures, of course reduce the time consumed in shutting off the vessels.Generally, the clips made of metal are narrow Ushaped or V shaped strips formed of tantalum or stainless steel which are capable of being deformed and possess sufficient strength to retain the deformation of the clip about the vessel. Also in certain instances, the clips are made of a polymeric material, both absorbable and nonabsorbable, and are configured so that they have a resilient hinge at one end and some type of interlocking mechanism at the other end. Examples of such metal or plastic clips are shown in U.S. Patents Nos. 3r867 r944 r 3,631,707, 3,439,523, 3,439,522, 3,363,628, 3,270,745, 4,449,531, and 4,476,865. Generally, the hemostatic or ligating clip is of a small or micro size to keep the foreign material being implanted in the patient as minimal as possible.In U.S. Patent No. 3,926,195 there is described a plastic clip designed for the temporary and permanent closing of the oviduct and vas deferens in humans. These clips have a clamping surface of from 6 to 10 millimeters in length and from 3 to 6 millimeters in width.While all of the above described clips may be used to close individual vessels or tubes, there are certain procedures where the vascular system is so intermeshed in tissue that it is impossible to use individual clips to close off that vascular system. For example, in a hysterectomy, the uterus is partially held in position by vascular connective tissue generally termed the broad ligament. The broad ligament comprises a double fold of tissue which is quite vascular that is, has a number of vesssels carrying blood disposed in or about the broad ligament. The ligament may be from 8 to 10 centimeters in length and a few centimeters in width. In performing a hysterectomy the broad ligaments on each side of the uterus must be tied off or closed, that is, hemostasis must be obtained throughout the vascular system of the broad ligament.In the past, this has generally been accomplished by the surgeon crushing increments of the broad ligament across its width and tying off the crushed portion with an appropriate suture. This can be a time consuming process. This traumatic clamping coupled with the bunched pedicles of tissue could predispose the area to abdominal adhesions. There are a number of other surgical procedures which require hemostasis or the tying off of vascular systems disposed within tissue and in which individual vessels cannot be dissected and ligated but the entire system must be ligated. These are surgical procedures such as an appendectomy, bowel resection, and the like.It is an object of the present invention to provide a ligating clip that may be used with vascular systems connected to or running through tissue. It is an object of this invention to provide a flat line of hemostatic pressure without causing pressure necrosis as with metal clamps, traumatic perforations as with staple and precluding bunched pedicles as with ligatures. It is an object of the present invention to provide a ligating clip that may be used without requiring the dissecting of the vessels from the surrounding tissue. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a clip to close off a vascular tissue system which will not irritate or cause trauma to the surrounding tissue. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a clip that has minimal lateral movement of the clamping surfaces once the clip is closed.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a clip which will not interfere with future diagnostic techniques such as x ray imaging, CT scanning, and the like. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a clip for use in closing vascular tissue which is economical to manufacture. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an instrument for applying such clips to vascular tissue.Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides a sterile, biocompatible clip for use in closing or stopping the blood flow in vascular tissue. The clip has a first leg member and a second leg member with the leg members connected at their prDximal ends by a resilient hinge. Each of the leg members has a tissue clamping surface. The clamping surface of one leg member is disposed in opposing relationship to the clamping surface of the other leg member so that the clamping surfaces are approximately parallel when the clip is in the closed position. The clamping surfaces have a length of approximately at least 2 centimeters.The legs are reinforced longitudinally with structural ribbing to minimize material content. The first leg member terminates at its proximal end in a tissue penetrating means which extends in a direction towards the distal end of the second leg member. In the preferred embodiments of the clip of the present invention, the tissue penetrating member comprises a sharp point. The distal end of the first leg member also has a first locking means. The second leg member terminates at its distal end in a second locking means which interlocks with the first locking means when the clip is in the closed position.The second leg member also includes means disposed at its distal end for shrouding the tissue penetrating means of the first leg member when the clip is in the closed position. This shrouding of the tissue penetrating means prevents irritation or trauma that might be caused to adjacent tissue by virtue of the use of the clip. The shroud also prevents laterl movement between the leg member when the clip is in the closed position. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the leg members of the clip are longitudinally reinforced by a ridge disposed longitudinally on the outer surface of the clip opposite the tissue clamping surface. It is desirable to reinforce these legs to be certain that the legs will stay parallel when they are closed about the vascular tissue and will not bend or bow and, hence, not provide hemostasis. The beam faces of the legs contain one and two longitudinal ribs respectively to form the tissue into a labyrinth for further transverse security. Preferably, a central cone point and its receiving recess prevent the clip from pivoting off of an edge plane of tissue.The present invention also includes an applier for use with the clip of the present invention. The preferred embodiment of the applier of the present invention, is a forceps type instrument, with a pair of legs pivotally hinged together. At one end of these legs disposed from the pivot point are means for gripping or grasping the applier to pivot the legs about the pivot point. Disposed at the opposite end of these legs from the pivot point are a pair of jaws for grasping or holding the clip of the present invention in an open position. Each of the jaws include a pair of longitudinally spaced apart pins extending from one jaw in a direction towards the other jaw. The pins engage suitable recesses disposed at the distal ends of the clip and by virtue of being spaced apart prevent rotation of a clip being held by the jaws.Brief Description of the DrawingsThe present invention will be further described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a plan view of the clip of the present invention in a fully open position Fig. 2 is a bottom view taken at 2 2 of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is an end view taken at 3 3 of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is another end view taken at 4 4 of Fig. 1 Fig. 5 is a perspective view of the clip of the presentInvention in an open position ready for application Fig. 6 is a plan view of a clip applier of the present invention andFig. 7 is a plan view of a clip applier of the present invention with a clip placed in the open position in the jaws of the applier.Detailed Description of the DrawingsReferring to Figs. 1 through 4 of the drawings, there is shown a clip of the present invention. The clip 10 comprises a first leg member 11 and a second leg member 12. The leg members have tissue clamping surface 13 and 14 respectively. The leg members are joined at the proximal ends by a resilient hinge portion 15. On the tissue clamping surface of one of the leg members there is a longitudinally extending ridge 16 and on the tissue clamping surface of the opposite leg member there are two longitudinally extending ridges 17 and 18. These latter ridges are spaced apart so that when the leg members are brought into a parallel relationship the ridge on the first leg member will position itself between the pair of ridges on the second leg member.Though in this embodiment longitudinal ridges have been shown, the ridges, of course, can be transverse or other configurations as desired to aid in gripping tissue. To also aid in the gripping of the tissue there is disposed or extending from the tissue clamping surface of the first leg member a sharp point 19 and disposed in the tissue clamping surface of the opposite leg member is a corresponding recess 20 so that when the legs are brought into a parallel position the point on the first leg member enters the recess of the second leg member to grip tissue placed between the legs.The sharp point 19 also prevents rotation about the latch on an edge plane of tissue. Along the back or outer surface 21 and 22 of each member, extending from the resilient hinge portion to the distal end of the leg member, is a narrowed upstanding ridge 23 and 24 which longitudinally reinforces and provides rigidity to the leg member. The structural ribbing provides rigidity while minimizing material content.Because of the size of the clip, it is important that the leg members be reinforced so they remain straight and will not bow or bend or otherwise deform during use. Disposed at the distal end of the first leg member is a penetrating means 25. The penetrating means is a sharp pointed portion which extends away from the tissue clamping surface of the first leg member and towards the tissue clamping surface of the second leg member when the clip is in the closed position. This sharp pointed portion has an undercut ledge 26 which is the locking means and which will interlock with an appropriate ridge 27 disposed at the distal end of the second leg member. At the back or outer surface of the end leg member and at the distal end thereof is a recess 28 and 29 for accepting an applier gripper means from a suitable applier used to apply the clip.The distal end of the second leg member comprises an expanded portion 30 which has its free end open 31 for accepting the pointed penetrating point of the distal end of the opposite leg member. This opening includes the ledge 27 for interlocking with the ridge 26 at the end of the pointed penetrating means.It is a simple matter to mold or produce the clip in the fully opened position as shown in Fig. 1. This may be accomplished by any of the molding techniques as are wellknown in the art. As shown in Fig. 5, the clip 40 is bent about the resilient hinge portion 41 into the configuration as shown in Fig. 5 with the legs 42 and 43 diverging from the resilient hinge while the clip is in the open position. On closing of the clip, the ledge 44 at the bottom of the penetrating point 45 on the first leg member interlocks with the ridge 46 in the opening 47 at the distal end of the second leg member to lock the two legs together and hold the legs in an approximately parallel position.In the closed position the penetrating point is entirely shrouded or enclosed by the distal end of the second leg member so that the point cannot irritate or cause trauma to adjacent tissue and so there is no lateral movement between the leg members 42 and 43.The clips of the present invention are most conveniently molded of biologically acceptable non metallic materials which may be absorbable or non absorbable. Preferred absorbable polymers include homopolymers and copolymers of glycolide and lactide and p dioxanone. Preferred nonabsorbable polymers include nylon and polypropylene.The tissue clamping surfaces of the clips should be approximately 2 centimeters in length and may be as much as 2 1 2 to 3 or even more centimeters in length. This length is important in order to take a substantial bite in the vascular tissue which is to be closed. A plurality of these clips may be used to close a very wide vascular tissue, in doing so the clips are placed incremently across the width of the vascular tissue to be closed. Fig. 6 illustrates a forceps type clip applier comprising two handle members 51 and 52 crossing at hinge point 53 and maintained in a normally opened position by a spring 54. One of the handles extends beyond the hinge forming a jaw member 55 while the extension of the other handle extends beyond the hinge forming a complementary jaw member 56. The jaws are of identical design and each are provided with a pair of longitudinally spaced apart pins 57. The pins extend towards each other as shown.These pins fit in the opening at the back of the distal ends of each of the leg members of the clip when the clip 58 is placed in the instrument in the open position as shown in Fig. 7.The longitudinally spaced apart pins hold the clip in the applier and aid in preventing rotation of the clip in the applier. Also, by placing these pins directly over the distal end portions of the clip, the force of the applier is directly applied to the portion of the clip which is used to penetrate the tissue. The applier allows for total visibility of the clip during use and is especially suitable for use in surgical procedures where visibility is at a premium. The resilient hinge portion of the clip which tends to force the legs to diverge aids in holding the clip in the applier by pressing the distal ends of the clip against the jaws of the applier. As can be appreciated, many variations in both the clip design and the applier design other than the embodiments disclosed herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.Having now described the invention in considerable detail, it should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and alterations may be made to the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
