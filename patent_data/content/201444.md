# Low volatile organic content cathodic electrodeposition baths.

## Abstract
A reactive diluent for use in an amine containing epoxy resin composition. The reactive diluent comprises a soft, blocked isocyanate crosslinking agent. This reactive diluent is incorporated into the resin in addition to the primary cross linking agent. The use of the reactive diluent eliminates or substantially reduces the need for volatile organic coales cent solvents and produces smooth, durable corrosion resis tant coatings.
