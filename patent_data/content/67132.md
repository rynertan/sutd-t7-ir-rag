# Improvement in bipolar transistor amplifiers with a high linear dynamic range.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with the technique of amplifying electrical signals by means of solid state devices transistors . The signals concerned are of the amplitude modulated carrier type processed in band pass channels. The invention sets out to make possible, within the prefixed limits of displacement from linearity the use of maximum input signals greater than is possible by means of the usual techniques. This is without any worsening of the minimum noise figure obtainable from the amplifier stage in question.
