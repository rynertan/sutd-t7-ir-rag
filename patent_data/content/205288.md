# Apparatus for supporting an imaging device.

## Abstract
A fiberscope 24 is inserted into a highly rigid tube 30 which is clamped to a fiberscope supporting device 16 and camera supporting device 23 carried from a robot wrist 4 of a welding robot having a swing axis and a twist axis, thereby allowing the camera supporting device 23 and tube 30 to move integrally with the robot wrist. No twisting of the fiber scope 24 occurs within the operating range of the robot wrist. Also, the angle of bend of the fiberscope is held to a constant value below its allowable bending angle. Conse quently, an imaging device is realized in which interference between the object to be worked, i.e. the weld 9 and the optical system is minimized.
