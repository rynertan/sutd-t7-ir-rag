# A CLASP FOR A CHAIN

## Abstract
The clasp for a chain consists of three parts, of a casing 20 bent to a U shape, a plate like locking member 10 located between the flanks of the casing 20 and pivotably supported by a pin 30 . The locking member 10 has at one of its ends a hook 11 and at the opposite end an eyelet 12 . The pin 30 has a rectangular cross sectional shape and is supported in the casing 20 in a nonrotatable manner. A rectangular opening 14 located in the locking member 10 opens into a slot 15 which forms a resiliently flexible tongue 16 abutting the opening 14 . A pivoting movement of the locking member 10 within the casing 20 liberates the insertion opening 11a otherwise closed off by an edge area of the casing 20 . Because the eyelet 12 as well as the hook 11 are located at the locking member 10 , a pulling force of the chain will be directly transmitted by this part and accordingly, there is no danger that the clasp will open when subject to a pulling force.
