# Feeding apparatus for printing medium.

## Abstract
Paper sheets 3 are fed from stack in sheet feed tray 13 past a detector 5 around a printing platen to a head or top of form position TOF adjacent a print head 6 . The TOF position is set by a button 27b which programs data into a first memory RAM 20 . CPU 18 operates a drive motor 7 so that when the detector 5 detects the leading edge of a paper sheet, the motor 7 runs for an extent primarily determined by the data in memory 20 so that the sheet is moved to the TOF position. The system can be adjusted for frictional and other variables by programming into RAM 20 a correction data for correcting the data held in RAM 20. The correction data in RAM 20a can be incremented or decremented by concurrent use of TOF button 27b and either one of form feed and line feed buttons 27c,d .
