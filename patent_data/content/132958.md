# THREE WAY POPPET VALVE, METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A three way poppet valve for directing the flow of a fluid that will permit precise, constant thickness patterns of fluid coating upon a moving surface and cause a minimum of after drool when the coating process is ceased. The three way poppet valve assembly is also provided with means to rapidly change the direction of fluid flow to create rapid on off fluid deposition cycle times and facilitate the formation of minimum length coatings on a rapidly moving surface.
