# Semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprises a base semiconduc tor portion and, thereon, first and second elevated semicon ductor portions separated by a channel. The uppermost surface of the first elevated semiconductor portion carries a metal electrical contact layer and the uppermost of the sec ond a dielectric layer. The surfaces defining the channel are substantially free of metal and dielectric. The structure can be used in a ridge waveguide laser, the first elevated semiconductor portion constituting the ridge 7 , 8 . Distributed feedback corrugations may be incorporated such devices 6 , or in other ridge waveguide structures.
