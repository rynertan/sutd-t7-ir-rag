# Method and apparatus for speckle pattern interferometric determination of point displacements.

## Abstract
A method of, and apparatus for, measuring displacement of a surface relative to a datum using an interferometer of the type in which a beam of co herent light is directed at the surface and first and second speckle interference patterns are formed and superimposed on one another. A single speckle of the superimposed patterns, is observed and the cyclic variation in intensity of the observed speckle, caused by a relative phase change between the first and second patterns due to displacement of the surface relative to the beam is observed. The number of cyclic variations in intensity of the observed speckle is counted and correlated to the amount of displacement relative to the datum.
