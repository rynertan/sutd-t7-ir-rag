# Steel refining method using slag.

## Abstract
A steal refining method of the type in which the steel is refined through an interfacial reaction between the molten steel in a vessel and a slag on the molten steel. The method simultaneously employs both blowing of an inert gas into the molten steel from the bottom of the vessel to stir the molten steel by bubbling and blowing an inert gas from the upper side of the vessel into the zone in which the movement of the slag is dull. Consequently, the stirring effect on the molten steel is enhanced to promote the refining reaction. The inert gas can contain a desulfurization agent.
