# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BLOWING SAND INTO A MOLD

## Abstract
The cavity of a foundry blow box for blowing sand into molds is formed by a tube extending downwardly but ter minating slightly above the blow plate forming the bottom of the blow box, thus forming a peripheral gap which is es sentially the only aperture for the admission of fluidizing air. The air tends to blow sand contacting the blow plate directly through its exit into the mold, although fluidizing the re maining sand through the cavity. Preferably, especially if quick setting sand is used, a plunger snugly fitting the tube moves through it to its bottom so that air from the gap scours the plunger and blow plate blowing out all sand. As the mold is lowered, a purge pan is substituted to receive any sand beyond the mold capacity. The rapid mixer is improved, using successive notched impeller blades that selectively impact the two streams of non curing sand to be mixed. The gap is wider than the sand particles. The plunger is the subject of a prior application of the inventor, used then with a finely apertured wall.
