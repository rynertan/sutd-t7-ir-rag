# Manufacture of a food product.

## Abstract
A machine 10 for manufacturing a food product in which an edible filling material is completely enclosed in an edible coating material, comprising outer, intermediate and inner spaced apart concentrically arranged extrusion con duits 11 13 means for extruding the coating material continuously through the channel between the outer and intermediate conduits to form a tube of coating means for extruding the filling material intermittently through the channel between the intermediate and inner conduits so that it forms a filling within the tube of coating means for mechanically isolating the filling material, on interruption of extrusion, from the filling within the tube of coating means for extruding further coating material alter nately to the extrusion of the filling material, through the inner conduit so that it flows within the tube of coating at the rear end of the filling and means for cutting the extruded tube cross sectionally between positions where filling is located.
