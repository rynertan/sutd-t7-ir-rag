# Fluid operated pump displacement control system.

## Abstract
In a fluid operated pump displacement control system wherein a self pressure is defined as a first control signal, an arbitrary switchable second control signal different from said first control signal is added to said first control signal, and a displacement is adapted to be switched to a displacement corresponding to a value of said second control signal as added to said first control signal.
