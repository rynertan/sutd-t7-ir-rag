It is a general objective of the present invention to provide a composition of matter adaptable for use in coating compositions, including compositions adapted for use in solvent based sprayable coating compositions, compositions adapted for use in electrodeposition coating compositions, and compositions adapted for use in the manufacture of adhesives, molding compounds and textile treating resins and the like.Additional objects and aspects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description thereof. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention provides a self crosslinking resin, specifically, a substantially gel free diene functional blocked dieneophile functional aminoepoxy resin, preferably of number average molecular weight Mn about 1000 9000. Such aminoepoxy resin is the reaction product of suitable diepoxide with reactant comprising chain extending reactants and, optionally, end capping reactants.Specifically, the chain extending reactants comprise i amine functional diene, particularly di secondary amine functional bis diene or, more preferably, mono primary amine functional diene, for example furfuryl amine, or a mixture thereof, and ii amine functional blocked dieneophile, particularly di secondary amine functional bis blocked dieneophile or, more preferably, mono primary amine functional blocked dieneophile, for example amino maleamic acid, or a mixture thereof. Suitable end capping reactants include monofunctional reactants, that is, reactants bearing a single functionality substantially reactive with epoxy functionality of the chain extended resin. The term monofunctional in this usage, however, is not intended to be exclusive of diene functionality or dieneophile functionality.Thus suitable end capping reactants include monofunctional diene reactants, for example mono secondary amine functional diene reactants and monohydroxy functional diene reactants, and mono functional blocked dieneophile reactants, for example mono secondary amine functional blocked dieneophile reactants and monohydroxy functional blocked dieneophile reactants. and any mixture thereof. The self crosslinkable resin of the invention is particularly useful in coating compositions and according to preferred embodiments further discussed below is readily adaptable for use in solvent based coating compositions and in aqueous based electrodeposition coating compositions. Coatings provided by the present invention are found to be highly resistant to solvents and humidity and to provide exceptional corrosion protection for the underlying substrate. The invention is particularly advantageous in thÅat it provides coatings which cure at relatively low temperature. The selfcrosslinkable resin of the invention also may be used in the manufacture of low pressure laminates, adhesives, molding compounds, textile treating resins and the like. According to a significantly advantageous aspect of the invention, the molecular weight of the selfcrosslinkable aminoepoxy resin is readily controllable to suit an intended application. Thus, for use in a cathodic electrocoating composition, for example, the aminoepoxy resin is readily provided having preferred number average molecular weight Mn of about 1000 9000 for use in solvent based sprayable coating compositions, such resin is readily provided having preferred number average molecular weight Mn of about 1000 4000. Such molecular weight control is achieved by selection of diepoxide reactant having appropriate epoxide equivalent weight and or by adjusting the molar ratio of diepoxide to chain extension reactants to end capping reactants.Lower molecular weight resin is provided as such ratio approaches 2 1 1, respectively higher molecular weight resin is provided as it approaches 1 1 0. The self crosslinkable composition of the present invention is particularly suitable for use in solvent based sprayable primer coating compositions.Such primer compositions can be used, for example, to form heat curable, highly alkali resistant primer coatings on automotive vehicle body panels. The self crosslinkable composition of the present invention also can be adapted for use in cathodic electrodeposition. For such use. the aminoepoxy resin is preferably of number average molecular weight Mn above about 1000. more preferably about 1000 9000, and is at least partially neutralized with a solubilizing acid.typically an organic acid such as, for example, acetic acid or the like. The at least partially neutralized resin is then dispersed in aqueous solvent. Such coating composition will deposit a heat curable coating at the cathode in an electrodeposition coating process according to techniques well known to the skilled in the art. Other features and advantageous of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description including the preferred embodiments and best mode of the invention. Detailed Description of the InventionDiepoxide Reactant Suitable diepoxide reactants include any of a wide variety of diepoxide known to the skilled of the art, for example aliphatic and aromatic diepoxide resins. The diepoxide reactant preferably has epoxide equivalent weight of about 150 2000. In general, the epoxide equivalent weight is selected to suite the intended use of the final composition. Thus, for spray able solvent based coating compositions a lower composi tion viscosity is desirable. For such use it is generally preferable to employ diepoxide having epoxide equivalent weight of about 150 1000. In comparison, for example, cathodic electrodeposition compositions of the invention preferably have higher viscosity and for uch use diepoxides having epoxide equivalent weight of about 150 2000 are generally preferred. The diepoxide is preferably free of carboxy ester moieties linking the epoxide groups0 since such carboxy ester free diepoxides have been found to provide cured coatings according to the invention which are significantly more alkali resistant and provide signif cantly enhanced corrosion protection to the underlying substrate. One class of suitable diepoxides includes theBisphenol A epichlorohydrin resins. These are commercially available as, for example, Epon 828, 1001 or 1004 trademarks marketed by Shell Chemical Company. ouston. Texas, U.S.A. Suitable diepoxides may contain aromatic groups, such as benzene nuclei, at a preferred average of at least about one, more preferably at least about two, for each terminal epoxy group. Especially suitable are Bisphenol A epichlorohydrin resins comprising up to 10 or more bis phenol moieties within the epichlorohydrin reaction product backbone, for example those of number average molecular weight up to about 8000, preferably 300 4000. Aliphatic diepoxides, particularly lower molecular weight aliphatic diepoxides, including cycloaliphatic diepoxides are used preferably in conjunction with aromatic diepoxides to modify coating properties.Certain lower molecular weight aliphatic diepoxides used alone may produce coatings which are relatively more humidity sensitive. Suitable aliphatic diepoxides include, for example, the reaction product of epihalohydrin with aliphatic diols such as glycol, epoxidized polybutadienes, vinylcyclohexenedioxide and dipentene dioxide. Still further, hydrogenated BisphenolA epichlorohydrin products may also be employed. Numerous additional suitable diepoxides are commercially available or readily prepared using well known techniques and commercially available starting materials0 and these will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. Compatible mixtures of any of these compound also are suitable.Amine Functional Diene Chain Extending Reactant Amine functional dienes suitable for the present invention are those comprising conjugated double bonds.particularly, those suitable for Diels Aldes cycloaddition reaction at elevated temperature with ene functionality or with other dieneophile functionality.Suitable amine functional dienes include many well known to the skilled of the art.

According to one most preferred embodiment. the monoprimary amine functional diene reactant is of the general formula EMI10.2 wherein R 3is a diva lent organic linking moiety containing no ester groups and no functionality substantially reactive with the diepoxide or with the endcapping reactant, if used. The reaction product, that is, the aminoepoxy resin, comprises, on average, at least one diene moiety per molecule. Each diene moiety will be available for reaction with a dieneophile moiety of the resin during heat curing of a composition according to the inventon.More preferably, the aminoepoxy resin provides, on average about two or more, such as about 2 10 diene moieties per molecule.Amine Functional Blocked DieneoPhile Reactant The aminoepoxy resin of the invention preferably comprises, on average, at least about 1, preferably about 2 10, blocked dieneophile groups per molecule. The blocked dieneophile groups are capable of reacting with the diene moieties of the aminoepoxy resin upon curing the composition at elevated temperature, typically about 1000C 2000C. Preferably the dieneophile moiety is an ene moiety although other suitable dieneophile moieties will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure According to a preferred embodiment of the invention. the amine functional blocked dieneophile comprises monoprimary amine functional blocked dieneophile reactant.The mono primary amine functional blocked dieneophile reactant is preferably the reaction product of maleic anhydride, unsaturated lactone, or a compatible mixture thereof with a suitably reactive diene, and a suitably reactive diamine, The diene reactant acts as a reversible blocking agent for the dieneophile functionality and such reaction can be carried out prior to, during or after the reaction with the diamine. The diene reactant preferably has a boiling point at or below the cure temperature of the coating composition such that it will be driven from the coating composition during cure thereof 1 and not compete with the diene functionality of the aminoepoxy resin for reaction with the dieneophile functionality.To maximize yield of mono primary amine functional blocked dieneophile, it is preferred to add the anhydride or lactone reactant slowly to an excess of diamine reactant. According to one prefered embodiment, the mono primary amine functional blocked dieneophile reactant comprises amino maleamic acid, specifically, the reaction product of suitable diamine with 3,6 endoxo 1,2.3,6 tetrahydrophthalic anhydride. The named anhydride is commercially available, for example from Aldrich ChemicalCo., Milwaukee, Wisconsin. U.S.A. and also can be prepared as the reaction product of furan with maleic anhydride. More generally1 suitable amine functional blocked dieneophile reactant comprises the reaction product of i suitable diamine, and ii suitable conjugated diene blocking agent, with iii ene reactant selected from the group consisting of maleic anhydride, suitable unsaturated lactones or the like or any compatible mixture thereof, wherein the lactone preferably is selected from those of the general formula EMI12.1 wherein each R is selected independently from H,C1 C5 alkyl, C1 C5 hydroxy alkyl and the like, and y is preferably about 1 4. Numerous suitable diamines are commercially available and will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. Suitable diamines include those of the 5 formula H,N 5 general formula H2N R NH2 wherein R is any divalent organic linking moiety of at least two carbon.preferably 2 15 carbons, which is substantially unreactive with diepoxide, the ene reactant, the diene blocking agent, and the end capping agent if employed .Included are branched, straight and cyclic aliphatic diamines, aromatic diamines and arylaliphatic diamines.Exemplary diamines include isophorone diamine which is preferred in view of the difference in reactivity of the two amine groups resulting in higher yield of the desired product, 1,4 butanediamine, 1,5 pentanediamine, 1.6 hexanediamine, and a compatible mixture of any of them. Other preferred diamines include those of molecular weight about 80 300 which comprise no sub stantially reactive functionality other than amine.Exemplary such diamines include 1,2 ethylenediamine, 1,3 propanediamine, the isomers of toluene diamine and the like and a compatible mixture of any of them. Suitable conjugated diene blocking agents include numerous commercially available dienes readily apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. Included are any sufficiently reactive conjugated aliphatic, cyclic aliphatic, and heterocyclic dienes which will liberate or de block from the dieneophile moiety at the cure temperature of the coating composition. The diene blocking agent should be substantially unreactive with the other reactants except for the dieneophile functionality of the ene reactant.Exemplary conjugated diene blocking agents include furan which is preferred since it de blocks at approximately 1200C, conjugated cycloalkadiene such as 1,3 cyclopentadiene and 1,3 cyclohexadiene, conjugated alkadiene preferably of about 4 10 carbons. for example, 1,3 butadiene, 2 methyl 1,3 butadiene, and the like and a compatible mixture of any of them. The reactions described above for preparation of the amine functional blocked dieneophile cross linking agent can be conducted according to methods well known to the skilled of the art.It should be noted that where symetrical diamine is employed, such as 1,6 hexanediamine, rather than diamine wherein one amino group is substantially more reactive than the other, such as isophorone diamine, there can be a portion of the diamine reactant in which both amine groups remain unreacted due to reaction of both amie groups of another portion of the diamine reactant. To prevent subsequent unwanted amine reactions and gelling, substantially all unreacted diamine should be removed from the reaction product. Removal of diamine can be done by methods known to the skilled of the art, for example by thorough rinsing of the reaction product with dimethoxy ethane or other suitable solvent. End CaPpina Reactant The aminoepoxy resin of the invention preferably is end capped by reaction with suitable monofunctional reactant. Preferred are monofunctional diene reactants and monofunctional blocked dieneophile reactants1 of molecular weight about 70 300, included among which are many well known to the skilled of the art. Exemplary such end capping reactants include mono secondary amine functional diene, monohydroxy functional diene, monosecondary amine functional blocked dieneophile, monohydroxy functional blocked dieneophile, and any mixture thereof. As noted above, the term monofunctional in this usage is intended to mean a single functionality substantially reactive with epoxy functionality and is not exclusive of diene or dieneophile functionality. Especially where the aminoepoxy resin is already both diene and blocked dieneophile functional, the monosecondary amine functional end capping reactants generally are preferred over mono hydroxy functional reactants in view of the milder reaction conditions required for amine epoxy reaction. Preferably no more than about 10 20 of the total epoxide functionality is reacted with end capping reactant. As noted above, however, the molar ratio of reactants can be varied to provide aminoepoxy resin of desired molecular weight.The chain extended diepoxide reactant is reacted with the end capping agent. if any, according to methods well known to the skilled in the art. Accordingly. for example. the chain extended diepoxide is mixed with the end capping agent and the mixture is heated to reaction temperature, typcially above 60 800C. until sub stantially all epoxide functionality has reacted. Suitable monofunctional diene end capping agents include those of formula I EMI15.1 wherein R is a monohydroxy functional hydrocarbon moiety or a mono secondary amine functional hydrocarbon moiety.respectively. which comprises no functionality substantially reactive with the chain extended diepoxide reactant other than the hydroxy or secondary amine functionality andEMI15.2 or the like, wherein R1 is hydrogen, straight. branched or cyclo alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or the like. and eachR2 is the same or different and is selected from hydrogen. hydroxy, carboxy, straight, branched or cycloalkyl1 aryl, arylalkyl, and the like, each alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl moiety of R1 and R2 being unsubstituted or mono or poly hydroxy substituted or mono or poly amino substituted and X X , X31 X and X are the same or different and each is hydrogen, hydroxy. carboxy, amino, straight, branched or cyclo alkyl, aryl, arylakyl, cyano, nitro, or the like, or X1 and X5 together are alkylene, 0 . NR wherein R1is as defined above, or like divalent group resulting in a cyclic diene moiety . each alkyl. aryl. arylalkyl and alkylene moiety of X1, X2. X3, Xo and X5 being unsubstituted or mono or poly hydroxy substituted or mono or polycarboxy substituted or mono or poly amino substituted.Exemplary monohydroxy dienes include furfuryl alcohol and 2 hydroxymethyl 1.3 butadiene and the like and any compatible mixture thereof. Preferred monofunctional blocked dieneophile end capping reactants include the reaction product of a suitable diene blocking agent, as described above. such as furan, cyclopentadiene, and the like, with monohydroxy functional or mono secondary amine functional dieneophile such as, for example. hydroxypropyl methacrylate, methylol maleimide or the like or a compatible mixture thereof. Again, since such monofunctional end capping reactant provides only end capping and not chainextending reaction with the diepoxide. self crosslinking aminoepoxy resin of lower molecular weight can be provided according to this embodiment. Such lower molecular weight resin is particularly advantageous for use in sprayable solvent based coating compositions. The amine functional blocked dieneophile and the amine functional diene reactants can be reacted simultaneously with the diepoxidea but preferably are reacted sequentially. If reacted simultaneously. it will be within the skill of the art to select suitable molar ratios, in view of the relative reactivity of the reactants a to achieve the desired degree of diene and blocked dieneophile functionality in the product amino epoxy resin. It is generally preferred to react sequentially, since this is found to provide a resin product of narrower molecular weight range. It is generally preferred that the diene functionality and the blocked dieneophile functionality of the selfcrosslinking aminoepoxy resin of the invention be present in a ratio of approximately 1 2 to 2 1. respectively, and most preferably such ratio is about 1 1.The end capping reactant s can be employed either simultaneously with or, more preferably. subsequently to the chain extension reactants. If reacted simultaneously, it will be within the skill of the art to select suitable reactant ratios, in view of their relative reactivities. to produce an aminoepoxy resin product having the desired number average molecular weight and having the desired degree of functionality.Crosslinking Aqent Although the resin of the invention is selfcrosslinking. additional crosslinking agent may be employed. The diene functional blocked dieneophile functional aminoepoxy resin provides free hydroxy groups as a result of the amine epoxy reactions. Therefore.according to one embodiment of the invention the crosslinkable composition further comprises suitable crosslinking agent reactive with such hydroxy groups. Numerous such crosslinking agents are well known to the skilled of the art and include. for example, any of a variety of aminoplast crosslinking agents. for example.partially alkylated melamines melamines formaldehyde resins modified by alcohols , for example. partially methylated melamines and butylated melamines. polyalkyl ethers of the polymethylol melamines, for example.hexamethoxy methylmelamine urea formaldehyde condensate modified by alcohol. for example a paraformaldehyde and trioxane polymethylol compounds of hexamethylene diurea polycarboxylic acid such as adipic acid and the dimethylol amide and methylol ether thereof terra methylolhydrazodicarbonamide polymethylol compounds of polycaprolactam and methylol ethers thereof and the like and a compatible mixture of any of them. Butylated melamines are preferred since they are readily commercially available and provide suitable crosslinking reactivity with the aminoepoxy resin of the invention. Also suitable are blocked polyisocyanate cross linking agents. As used herein blocked polyisocyanate means an isocyanate compound containing two or more isocyanato groups. each of which has been reacted with a blocking agent which will prevent reaction of the isocyanate group at room temperature with compounds that conventionally react with such groups. and at least some of which will permit that reaction to occur at higher cure temperatures. In general, the blocked polyisocyanate may be prepared by reacting a sufficient quantity of an active hydrogen containing blocking agent with the polyisocyanate to insure that substantially no free isocyanato groups are present. The proper proportion of blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent to aminoepoxy resin will depend, in part, upon the degree of hydroxy functionality of such resin the properties desired in the coating to be produced and, in part, upon the desired cure response of the coating composition which will depend. in turn. upon the baking schedule to be used in curing the coating composition and, in part. upon the desired storage stability of the composition, that is, upon the desired shelf life. Accoedingly, the amounts of such crosslinker that can be used varies considerably. Ilowever, it will be within the skill of the art in view of the present disclosure to provide blocked polyisocyanate cross linking agent in suitable amounts. Blocked polyisocyanates of numerous types may be employed in the compositions of the invent ion.Particularly suitable blocked polyisocyanates, which will be discussed further hereinafter.include blocked polymethylene polyphenol isocyanates, isocyanurate ring containing blocked polyisocyanates and certain oligoester modified blocked polyisocyanates. In the preparation of the blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent. any suitable organic polyisocyanate may be used. Representative examples include the aliphatic compounds such as trimethylene, tetramethylene, pentamethylene, hexamethylene. 1.2 propylene 1.2 butylene, 2.3 butylene. 1.3 butylene. ethylidene and butylidene diisocyanates the cycloalkylene compounds such as l, cyclopentane, 1,4 cyclohexane, and 1.2 cyclohexane diisocyanates the aromatic compounds such as m phenylene, p phenylene. 4,4 diphenyl, 1,5 naphthalene. and 1.4 naphthalene diisocyanates, the aliphatic aromatic compounds such as 4.4 diphenylene methane, 2.4 or 2.6 tolylene. or mixtures thereof, 4,4 toluidine, and 1,4 xylylene diisocyanates sub.stituted aromatic compounds such as dianisidine diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylether diisocyanate and chlorodiphenylene diisocyanate the triisocyanates such as triphenyl methane 4.4 4 triisocyanate. 1,3,5 tri isocyanate benzene and 2,4,6 triisocyanate toluene the tetraisocyanates such as 4.4 diphenyl d imethyl methane 2,2 ,5,5 tetraisocyanate and the polymerized polyisocyanates such as tolylene diisocyanate dimers and trimers. and the like. In addition. the organic polyisocyanate may be a prepolymer derived from a polyol including polyether polyol or polyester polyol, including polyethers which are reacted with excess polyisocyanates to form isocyanate terminated prepolymers. The polyols may be simple polyols such as glycols. e.g.. ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. as well as other polyols such as glycerol tri methylolpropane. pentaerythritol, and the like. as well as mono ethers such as diethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol and the like and polyethers, i.c.. alkylene oxide condensates of the above. Among the alkylene oxides that may be condensed with these polyols to form polyethers are ethylene oxide. propylene oxide.butylene oxide. styrene oxide and the like. These are generally called hydroxyl terminated polyethers and can be linear or branched. Examples of polyethers include polyoxyethylene glycol. polyoxypropylene glycol. polyoxytetramethylene glycol, polyoxyhexamethylene glycol. polyoxynonamethylene glycol. polyoxydecamethylene glycol.polyoxydodecamethylene glycol and mixtures thereof.Other types of polyoxyalkylene glycol ethers can be used. Especially useful polyether polyols are those derived from reacting polyols such as ethylene glycol.diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1.4 butylene glycol, 1.3 butylene glycol. 1.6 hexanediol. and their mixtures glycerol. trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane. 1.2.6 hexanetriol. pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol. tripentaerythritol. polypentaerythritol, sorbitol, methyl glucosides, sucrose and the like with alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide.propylene oxide1 their mixtures. and the like. A particular class of aromatic polyisocyanates which may be employed in the novel solvent based coat slg compositions of the invention are polymethylene poly phenol isocyanates having the formula EMI21.1 wherein x equals 1 to 3. The compounds, sold under the tradename PAPI by the Upjohn Chemical Company ofKalamazoo, Michigan, are particularly useful in compositions of the invention, resulting in compositions exhibiting desirable toughness in the final cured coating. The active hydrogen containing blocking agents which are reacted with the above described organic diisocyanates may be selected from numerous blocking agents which will be apparent to those skilled in this art. Preferred blocking agents include, for example, those selected from the group consisting of i aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic alkyl monoalcohols ii hydroxyl amines iii oximc iv lactams and v triazoles. Any suitable aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic alkyl monoalcohol may be used as a blocking agent in accordance with the present invention. For example, aliphatic alcohols, such as methyl. ethyl, chloroethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, 3,3,5 trimethylhexyl, decyl, and lauryl alcohols, and the like may be employed.Suitable cycloaliphatic alcohols include, for example, cyclo pentanol, cyclohexanol and the like, while aromatic alkyl alcohols include phenylcarbinol, methylphenylcarbinol, and the like. Minor amounts of even higher molecular weight relatively non volatile monoalcohols may be used, if desired, to serve as plasticizers in the coatings provided by the invention. Examples of hydroxyl amines which may be employed as blocking agents include ethanol amine and propanol amine. Suitable oxime blocking agents include, for example, methylethylketone oxime, acetone oxime and cyclohexanone oxime.Examples of lactams which may be used as blocking agents are c caprolactam. y butyrolactam and pyrrolidone, while suitable triazoles include compounds such as 1,2,4 triazole, l,2,3 benzotriazole, 1,213 tolyl triazole and 4,5 diphenyl 1,2,3 triazole. Particularly preferred active hydrogen containing blocking agents are methylethyl ketoxime and 2 ethylhexanol. i Isocyanurate Ring Containing Blocked IsocYanate ComPounds Within the scope of the above general class of blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agents, a particular class or type of blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent which may be employed in the coating compositions of the invention comprises isocyanurate ring containing blocked isocyanate compounds. In general, these blocked polyisocyanates may be formed by blocking with the aforementioned blocking agents. These compounds may be formed by cyclotrimerization of difunctional isocyanates.Usually, the reaction does not stop in this stage and continues through the formation of polyfunctional oligomers or a mixture of such oligomers with a portion of the pure trifunctional polyisocyanate. Mixtures of trifunctional product and various polyfunctional oligomers are commercially available. A particularly desirable blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent is the blocked form of the pure trifunctional isocyanurate represented by the following formula EMI23.1 wherein each L is selected independently from the group consisting of aliphatic. cycloaliphatic and aromatic groups and combinations thereof and B is the residue of an active hydrogen containing blocking agent. More specifically, this compound is disclosed in United States patent application Serial No. 368,178 filed April 14.1982, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. ii Oligoester Modified Blocked Polyisocyanates Still further particular blocked polyisocyanates useful as crosslinking agents in the coating compositions of this invention are oligoester modified blocked polyisocyanates prepared from a particular class of oligoester diols and triols. A first type of such oligoester modified blocked polyisocyanate is prepared from organic diisocyanates wherein one isocyanato group is more reactive than the other. with the more reactive isocyanato first being blocked with a blocking agent and the remaining isocyanato group then being reacted with hydroxyl functionality of an oligoester diol or triol as referred to above.The second type of oligoester modified blocked polyisocyanate may be prepared by reacting oligoester diols from the aforementioned class of oligoesters with an excess of organic diisocyanate so as to form an isocyanato terminated prepolymer followed by blocking of the terminal isocyanato groups of the prepolymer with an active hydrogen containing blocking agent. Each of these materials is particularly useful in the compositions of the invention and produces final cured coating compositions exhibiting good flexibility. Oligoesters of the type employed in the preparation of these crosslinking agents are described in UnitedStates Patent No. 4,322,508 issued March 30. 1982. the disclosure of which.is hereby incorporated by reference.The hydroxy functional oligoesters within the useful class of materials i have a number average molecular weight Mn between about 150 and about 3000. preferably between about 230 and about 1000, ii bear 2 or 3 hydroxyl groups per molecule a and iii are formed by an esterification reaction between a carboxylic acid and an epoxide. The esterification reaction products are selected from the group consisting of a the esterification reaction product of polycarboxylic acid. i.e., carboxylic acid bearing 2 or more carboxyl groups. and mono epoxide b the esterification reaction product oL polyepoxide. i.e.. a compound having 2 or more epoxide groups. and monocarboxylic acid. preferably containing no ethylenic unsaturation. and bearing no hydroxy functionality c the esterification reaction product of hydroxy functional carboxylic acid and mooor polyepoxide. preferably monoepoxide d the esterification reaction product of mono carboxylic acid and hydroxy functional mono or poly epoxide, preferably monoepoide and e mixtures of a d . As noted above a the first type of oligoester modified blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent is prepared by i reacting organic diisocyanate bearing one isocyanato group which is more reactive than the other with a sufficient amount of an active hydrogen containing blocking agent to react substantially with all of the more reactive isocyanate groups a thus providing a halfblocked diisocyanate and ii reacting this half blockcd intermediate with the above discussed oligoester. The organic diisocyanates employed in this synthesis. as well as the active hydrogen containing blocking agents, are discussed above in connection with the preparation of the isocyanurate ring containing blocked isocyanate crosslinking agents useful in compositions of the invention. The organic polyisocyanate blocking agent adduct intermediate is formed by reacting a sufficient quantity of the blocking agent with the organic diisocyanate to insure that one of the two NCO groups on the diisocyanate is reacted. The reaction between the organic diisocyanate and the blocking agent is exothermic and the diisocyanate and the blocking agent are preferably admixed at temperatures no higher than about 80 C, preferably below about 50 C, to minimize the exothermic effect. The diisocyanate blocking agent intermediate is next reacted with the oligoester diol or triol described above so as to react substantially all free or unblocked isocyanato groups of the ittermediate with hydroxyl groups of the oligoester. This reaction is carried out desirably at a temperature of about 800 120 C. As also discussed above, the second type of oligoester modified blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent useful in the novel solvent based coating composi tions of the invention is prepared by reacting an excess of organic diisocyanate with an oligoester diol from the above described class of oligoesters followed by reaction of the terminal isocyanato groups formed on the resulant prepolymer with an active hydrogen containing blocking agent as described above so as to react with sub stantially all the isocyanato groups. The diisocyanate starting material is used in excess in amounts sufficient to insure that the intermediate is isocyanate terminated. Therefore, it is preferable that the organic diisocyanates and the dihydroxy functional oligoester be reacted in a molar ratio of from greater than 1 1 up to 2 1.Numerous diisocyanates of the type described hereinbefore may be employed in the preparation of this intermediate. While it is not necessary that one isocyanato group be more reactive than the other. the preparation of this type of crosslinking agent does not preclude the use of such material. Other suitable crosslinking agents will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. In the crosslinkable compositions of the invention. if an aminoplast or blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent is employed a it may be advantageous in certain embodiments or for certain applications to include in the composition any of a variety of compatible catalysts known to the skilled of the art to catalyze reaction of same with hydroxy for example. for aminoplast crosslinking agent. paratoluenesulfonic acid.phosphoric acid. phenol acid phosphate. butyl maleate and the like or a compatible mixture of any of them.Exemplary catalysts for blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent include the Lewis acid catalysts and others known to the skilled of the art. In addition. a flow control agent, for example. polybutylacrylate a wetting agent. for example, silicone pigments a pigment dispersent and or a corrosion inhibitor, for example, chromate pigment. several of all of which are known to the skilled of the art, may be employed in the coating compositions of the invention. Di and polyhydroxy compounds of div r je character may be employed also in the composition of the invention to modify the properties of the composition i.e. the properties prior to or following cure as well as to act as solvent. including reactive solvent. for solubilizing the crosslinking composition. Thus, for example. these compounds may impart increased flexibility or reduce cratering in spray applied cured films of the crosslinking composition of the invention. Exemplary hydroxy compounds include ethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol. 1.6 hexanediol, and polycaprolactone diols.Another class of glycols includes hydroxy terminated polybutadienes. hydrogenated bis phenol A, such hydroxy compounds being of generally hydrophobic character and molecular weights of about preferably 100 5000, number average. Higher boiling solvents e.g. boiling point above about 180QC as 190 250 that are of polar character may tend to interact with the resinous components of crosslinking composition and thereby allow higher solids content. If such hydroxy functional compounds are included in the composition of the invention. then crosslinking agent reactive with hydroxy functionality. such as described above, may be advant geously employed. As noted above, pigments may be used in the compositions of the invention in accordance with known techniques. Pigments are employed most typically. for example. to enhance the efficacy of compositions employed as coating compositions over corrosionsusceptible sub strates. Chromate pigments. in particular. have been used to enhance corrosion protection. It is, however, a significant advantage of the present invention that chromate pigments need not be employed in composii.iort employed as such coating compositions over corrosion susceptible substrates. Cured coating of the invention are highly alkali resistant and provide excellent corrosion protection even without chromate pigments.Such pigments and others can be employed, however, and may be desirable for aesthetic purposes. Exemplary pigments include titanium dioxide, silica. carbon black.and barytes and are employed typically at pigment binder weight ratios of about 40 60 to about 60 40. It is one characterizing aspect of the present invention that the substituent groups on the diene functionality and on the dieneophile functionality of the aminoepoxy resin employed in the compositions of the invention can be selected to provide the desired degree of reactivity. that is, cure response. In particular, the degree of reactivity is increased by diene moiety substitution groups which1 in net effort, are electron donating, that is, which decrease the electron affinity of the diene functionality conjugated double bond. Thus, reactivity is increased by substituent groups such as.for example. amine and ether linkages. sulfoxide.sulfone. urethane and the like. Similarly, it will be understood by the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure, that the shelf stability of the composition is enhanced by ene moiety substitution groups which. in net effect. are electron withdrawing, that is.which increase the electron affinity of the ene functionality double bond. Thus. for example. shelf life is increased by electron withdrawing diene substitution groups such as nitro, cyano, ester i.e., EMI29.1 ene , nitrile, carbonyl, straight, branched or cyclo alkyl or cyclo alkyl or alkylene, arylene, aralkylene. 0 . Ns S and the like. It will be within the ability of those skilled in the art. in view of the present disclosure. to select diene substituent groups which provide, in net effect.the desired compromise between shelf stability and reactivity. It generally is preferred that no electron withdrawing group s be substituted directly on any carbon of either diene functionality double bond, nor on any adjacent or next adjacent atom. In certain applic tions. however, a composition of the invention may require extended shelf life or for some other reason call for or tolerate diene functionality comprising electron withdrawing substitution groups on the diene moiety. APPlications As noted above, the self crosslinking resin of the invention is useful in a variety of applications including. especially, in coating compositions to provide an aesthetic and or protective film on a substrate. In particular. such crosslinkable compositions of the invention can be formulated into a variety of primer formulations including both aqueous primer formulations and non aqueous primer formulations. Such primers can be used as coatings for bare or treated steels e.g., conversion coated with phosphates as well as for guide coats over primers which were previously deposited, for example. by electrodeposition. Conventional modifying ingredients can be used in such primer formulations including. for example. flow control agents. pigments.pigment dispersents. thixotropes, anti cratering aids, photo stabilizers and the like, as indicated above.Solvent Based Primers Compositions of the invention can be dispersed in organic solvent and applied to a substrate. for example a ferrous metal substrate. according to well known techniques such as by spray. curtain. dip and other coating application methods. For solvent based coatings to be applied by spray application methods. the amino epoxy resin preferably has number average molecular weight about 1000 3000. It will be within the ability of those skilled in the art to determine a suitable solvent and amount of same for a given coating composition of the invention, for a given application. It will be understood that any solvent allowed to remain in the cured coating should be inert to avoid adverse effects upon the cured coating or upon another coating used in conjunction with it. during the curing process or thereafter.Preferably the cured coating is substantially free of solvent. Sufficient solvent is used to reduce the viscosity of the coating composition to a level suitable for application to the substrate in the desired manner.Thus, for example. for a composition to be used as a spray applied primer coating composition, it is preferred that sufficient solvent be used to reduce the viscosity of the.coating composition to about 25 35 seconds, No. 4Ford Cup at 270C 800F . Solvent based coating compositions according to the invention are cured by heating same to a sufficient temperature for a sufficient time to drive off the solvent. to de block the dieneophile functionality, and to cause reaction of the diene functionality with the de blocked dieneophile functionality. Thus, for example.a solvent based coating composition comprising the cross linkable composition of the invention according to preferred embodiments described above1 applied by ray techniques to the surface of an automotive vehicle body panel as a primer coat would be cured by heating to a temperature above about 1300C more preferably about 135 1800C for approximately 15 30 minutes.Water Based Coasting Compositions The self crosslinkable composition of the present invention can be formulated into water based coating compositions. Accordingly, the aminoepoxy resin is at least partially neutralized by acid, preferably weak organic acid such as formic acid, acetic acid. which is generally preferred. latic acid, butryric acid or the like or a compatible mixture of any of them. Additional suitable neutralizing acids often referred to as solubilizing acid are known to the skilled of the art and will be apparent in view of the present disclosure.The at least partially neutralized resin is dispersed into water. preferably de ionized water for use either in spray application methods1 flow coating. etc. or electrodeposition methods. Cured coatings resulting from such methods are found to provide exceptionally good flow characteristics resulting in smooth and otherwise aesthetically superior films having exceptionally good solvent and humidity resistance. The cured coatings were also found to be highly alkali resistant and thus, to provide exceptionally good corrosion protection to the underlying substrate. Water based coating compositions according to the invention can be employed in spray application techniques. Thus. for example. they can be employed as a spray applied primer coat for automotive vehicle body panels. According to one embodiment. coating compositions of the invention can be applied to the surface of a substrate by electrodeposition techniques. According to this embodiment. the self crosslinkable coating composi tion, as described above, is at least partially. and preferably substantially totally neutralized with solubilizing acid and thereafter dispersed into deionized water or water organic solvent mixture to a concentration of about 5 25 weight percent. more preferably about 10 15 weight percent. The resulting water based composition can be used as a cathodic electrocoat composition. That is. the coating comprising the crosslinkable resin and crosslinking agent. catalysts etc.. if. any. will deposit upon the workpiece acting as the cathode according to known electrodeposition systems and techniques.For coating compositions adapted for cathodic electrodeposition, the diene functional aminoepoxy resin is preferably of number average molecular weight about 1000 9000, and the amine functional blocked dieneophile resin is preferably of number average molecular weight about 1000 9000. Cathodic electrodeposition according to the present invention is done preferably at voltages of about 1 500 volts. more preferably about 200 400 volts.Subsequent to electrodeposition. the coating on the substrate is heated to above about 1300C. more preferably about 1350 1800C for a time sufficient to effect the diene dieneophile reaction and to drive off substantially the entire aqueous solvent content of the coating. .rn general. it will be within the ability of those skilled in the art to select suitable electrodeposition voltage and baking temperatures and like process parameter in view of the particular application involved. Such aqueous solvent based coating compositions can comprise a mixture of water and water compatible solvent and diluents such as ethylene glycols and alkylated glycols. for example oxygenated solvents such as Cellosolves and carbitols and the like or a compatible mixture of any of them. For use as spray primers. for example. such wither based coating compositions can be formulated with high levels of water, for example.greater than about 10 . such as about 30 50 by weight.Obviously. the particular time and temperatures necesary to effect curing of the coating will depend upon the particular resins employed in the coating compositions and will depend upon the thickness of the coating. the use of catalysts. and like parameters familiar to the skilled of the art. The invention will be further understood by referring to the following detailed examples. It should be understood that these examples are presented by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. Unless otherwise specified. all references to parts are intended to mean parts by weight. Example I This example illustrates the preparation of a monoprimary amine functional blocked dienophile.Accordingly. 3.6 endoxo 1.2,3.6 tetrahydrophthalic anhydride was first prepared by combining 68g 1 mole furan with 98g 1 mole maleic anhyaride in 166g methyl ethyl ketone.
