# A driver circuit.

## Abstract
A driver circuit for driving a switching element 7 in response to a driving signal from a driving signal generator, which comprises an electrical isolation circuit 51 for generating an electrically isolated signal from the driving signal in response to the driving signal a first signal generator 52 which receives the electrically isolated signal, and generates a first signal which level changes from a second level to a third level in response to the level change of the electrically isolated signal from a first level to the second level a second signal generator 53 which receives the electrically isolated signal, and generates a second signal synchronous with the electrically isolated signal a third signal generator 54 which receives the signal from the first signal generator 52 , and generates a third signal synchro nous with the first signal a fourth signal generator 55 which receives the signals from the second and the third signal generators 53, 54 , and generates a fourth signal having a signal level equal to the sum of the second and the third signal levels, the generator 55 including a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor.
