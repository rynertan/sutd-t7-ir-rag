# Method for making a ceramic article from component parts.

## Abstract
A ceramic evacuatable enclosure 10, 30, 42 such as a laser body is made by the following process. A first body portion 12, 41 is formed with a channel 18, 19, 20, 43, 45, 46 and second body portion 11, 31, 40 of the same ceramic material is provided. Mating surfaces are polished on the body portions 11, 12 for bonding together by thermocom pression below the ceramic distortion temperature to achieve a vacuum seal. The ceramic may be alumina including 0.2 to 12 by weight of vitreous material. The thermocompression temperature may be in the range 120 C to 1750 C. Polishing is performed to a finish of from 0.01 µm to 0.15 µm. The body portions 11, 12 may have similar surface formations mutu ally aligned to provide a folded cavity 18, 19, 20 for an alumina waveguide CO₂ laser.
