# TRANSITION METAL COMPOSITION, PRODUCTION AND USE

## Abstract
A transition metal composition is obtained by reacting at least one specified transition metal compound with an organic magnesium compound. The transition metal com pound can be a compound of a metal of Group VA or Group VIA, or a mixture of compounds can be used, including a Group IVA metal compound such as titanium tetrachloride. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of polyha logenated compound such as carbon tetrachloride. The composition obtained may be a material containing a magnesium compound and compounds of at least two transition metals. The transition metal composition may be subjected to further treatments, for example with a halogen containing transition metal compound or a Lewis Base compound. The composition may be used, together with an organic metal compound, to give a polymerisation catalyst which can be used for the polymerisation of ethylene or other olefine monomers.
