# Exhaust gas recirculation control.

## Abstract
In an internal combustion engine, recirculation of ex haust gases is controlled to maintain the control pressure in a zone 60 of the recirculation passage proportional to a reference pressure and thus to provide exhaust gas recircula tion as a proportion of induction air flow. A duty cycle modulated valve 74 controls an exhaust back pressure port 76 and an atmospheric pressure port 80 to create the reference pressure, whereby the proportion of exhaust gases recirculated is established by the duty cycle and is indepen dent of the induction air flow.
