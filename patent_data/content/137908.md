## Description
DESCRIPTION CONTAMINANT FREE HIGH PURITY LIQUID DISPENSING SYSTEM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various liquids which are shipped in bulk containers are exposed to conditions which adversely affect the level of purity of these liquids. In many situations the maintenance of high purity is necessary for the practical acceptance of the liquid. For example, in semiconductor manufacturiny processes it is essential that chemicals of high purity be used, otherwise the resulting product is likely to be unacceptable. The source of contamination for these high purity liquids may be encountered at various stages in the handliny of such liquids.For example, contaminants may be introduced when the liquid in the bulk container, for which great care has been expended to avoid impurities, is withdrawn usiny dip tubes which may be exposed to contaminants through repeated use or when contact is made with contaminated dispensing equipment that comes into contact with the opening of the container, or its liquid is beiny dispensed from the openiny, of the shipping container or when the container is recapped to preserve the balance of unused contents for later use. In these and other situations the contaminant comes from sources that are oftentimes difficult to trace or it may even come from contaminated air which displaces the liquid withdrawn from the container.In some instances, to avoid pulling air into the system, a quantity of liquid is allowed to remain in the bulk shipping container when the chanye to a fresh container is made. This precludes the possibility of introducing unwanted air into the system as well as impurities with the air which would contaminate the liquid. However, such residual amounts of liquid which is left in the container and discarded, in the aggreyate, constitute a considerable economic waste. In the past various means to minimize sources ot contamination have been employed. U.S. Patent 3,941,270, tor example, discloses a bulk liquid container with a seal which may be perforated by a hollow spike perforator when the liquid from the container is to be dispensed. In the arrangement of U.S. Patent 3,941,270 the top of the bulk container is inverted on the perforatiny device to remove the liquid impervious seal and allow the liquid to flow. In that arranyement considerable risk of contamination is present at the contact between the container opening, which is relatively loose fitting and which sometimes results in premature perforation of the seal. It is apparent, accordinyly, that a need exists for a system that prevents contamination of high purity liquids in a bulk container in the process of transferriny, i.e. dispensing, the liquid from the container, in a more reliable and efficient manner while maintaininy the necessary high level of purity of the liquid and precludiny the entry of air into the liquid dispensing line. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention comprises a container devised for secure shipment and dispensing of a high purity liquid, a dispenser haviny a liquid reservoir tor dispensing the liquid and a valving means to prevent entry of air into the line through which the liquid is withdrawn from the dispenser. The dispenser is closed against contamination and is provided with a float or other means to stop flow of the liquid when the liquid therein is near depletion. The dispenser is provided with a punc turing device to perforate the seal of a bulk shippiny container from which the liquid is introduced into the dispenser.The dispenser and bulk container are provided with matiny mechanical interlockiny means, such as mating threads, so that as the container is positioned on the dispenser, perforation of the seal on the bulk container occurs when the container is inserted on the opening of the dispenser and then locked to prevent contamination. The system of the present invention, comprising the dispenser, the bulk container which is penetrated to feed the liquid into the dispenser only when the two are interconnected and exposure from contamination into the liquid is precluded and the air interlock means affords novel and highly practical advantages. The dispenser of the invention comprises a container preferably with a slanted or interior concave bottom haviny a suitable capacity such as about 3 liters or more. At the lower part of the bottom a flow control means is used such as a float valve which leads to a feed tube attached outside the container. The feed tube leads to a pump which delivers high purity liquid, such as a photoresist to a coating or other dispensing equipment used for example in semi conductor manufacturing.The float valve closes when the liquid level becomes low, thus shuttiny off flow and eliminating the possibility of air entering the feed tube. The top of the dispensing container is removable and contains in its center a fitting which has a depressed center with drain holes that permit liquid material to flow into the container. In the middle of this fitting is a hollow perforatiny or puncturiny device which is hollow and contains openinys to permit liquid to flow into the container through the drain holes in the fitting. The bulk shipping container or bottle of high purity liquid, such as photoresist, used in the system of the invention utilizes a cap with a round hole in the center which exposes a perforatable flexible plastic cap liner which seals the container. A second larder set of threads match threads on the interior of the center fitting and enable the bottle of photoresist to be rigidly held in place once it is seated. In feeding the dispenser from the bulk container, an outer protective cap is removed from the bulk container or bottle, exposing the bottle cap with the perforatable plastic cap liner. The shipping bottle is inverted and the puncturing device is pushed into the center hole of the cap and into the bottle. The flexible cap liner is pushed aside or perforated and the liquid flows into the dispenser reservoir.The float valve which controls flow from the reservoir then rises, permittiny flow of the liquid into the feed tube of the pump. Once the bottle is empty, it can be removed and replaced by a full bottle. The capacity of the dispenser reservoir permits continuous operation of the dispensing equipment, even if an empty bottle is not immediately replaced by a full bottle of the high purity liquid. The dispenser may employ a sight glass or other gauge to signal the level of the high purity liquid in the dispenser reservoir.

PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention a system for dispensiny high purity liquids is provided. As shown by reference to FIG. 1, the system comprises a dispenser unit shown generally at 20 which is adapted to receive a bulk container shown generally at 10 in which the high purity liquid is shipped. The system is devised to receive the mouth or nozzle 16 of the shipping container or bottle 10 while it is still in a sealed condition into a receiving adaptor 22 ot the dispenser 20. After the bottle 10 is inserted and is in proper position with the bottle nozzle 16 into the adapter 22, the seal 34 on the bottle opening is perforated when the bottle opening is positioned on the puncture mechanism 48 and interlocked by rotating it as will be described hereafter in greater detail.This interlockiny precludes contamination during the transfer from the bulk container to the dispenser 20. The dispenser 20 comprises a container which may generally be cylindrical in cross section having a reservoir 21 of suitable capacity, for example 3 liters or more. The reservoir 21 is preferably formed so that it has a domed bottom 21a to better utilize the liquid remaininy in the reservoir as the liquid nears depletion. The reservoir may also be formed to have a slanted bottom as shown at 21b in FIG. 6. At the lower part of the dome bottom 21a FIG 1 is a float valve, shown in phantom at 26, which leads to a feed tube 28 attached outside the dispenser container 20. When the liquid to be dispensed is an electronic chemical, such as a liquid photoresist composition, which must necessarily be maintained in high purity, the feed tube 28 may lead to a pump not shown which delivers photoresist to the coatiny or other equipment. The float valve 26 shown in greater detail in FIG. 5 closes when the liquid level becomes low, thus shutting off flow and eliminatiny the possibility of air enteriny the feed tube 28. The top of the dispensing container 20 is removable and contains in its center a fitting 22 which has a depressed center with drain holes 42 that permit liquid material to flow into the container reservoir 21. In the middle of this fitting 22 is a round pointed puncturiny device 40 which will be described by reference toFIGS. 4 and 5. The puncturing device 40 is also perforated at 41 to permit liquid flow into the container through the interior of the puncturing device 40. The bottles of high purity liquid used with this invention utilize a cap 17 with a round hole in the center 17a which exposes a perforatable plastic cap liner held on a first set of threads 18. A second laryer set of threads 14 match threads on the interior of the center fitting and enable the bottle of photoresist to be rigidly held in place once it is seated on the dispenser. In use, an outer protective over cap 11 is removed from the shipping container or bottle 10, exposing the bottle cap 17 with the plastic cap liner or seal 30.The bottle 10 is inverted and the puncturiny device 40 penetrates the seal 30 which comprises an inner seal 34 and an outer seal member 32, the latter preferably is provided with a central perforation as described in greater detail in U.S. Patent 3,941,270. As the bottle 10 is lowered on the puncture mechanism penetratiny the cap 17 and pushing aside the seal 3O, it is rotated locking threads 14 and 24. The liquid flows into the container reservoir 21 from the opening thus providea. When sufficient liquid is present in the reservoir 21 of dispenser 20, the float valve 26 rises, permitting flow into the feed tube 28 to the pump not shown . Once the bottle is empty, it can be removed and replaced by a full bottle. The capacity of the dispenser reservoir permits continuous operation of the equipment even if an empty bottle is not immediately replced by a full bottle of photoresist. The float valve shown in FIG. 5 is typical and comprises a body 50 containing therein a float 51 formed with precision mating surfaces to effect a tight seal between the surfaces 50a and 51a when the float is in the down position. As shown the float 51 is in the elevated position resting ayainst the retainer rod 52 which keeps the float 51 in place. Liquid enters the annular space 53 from the top at 54 and or from openings 55 in the sides of the body 50. When the liquid is diminished in the reservoir to a level about mid way of the vertical height of the float 51, the float sits on the mating body base surface 50a and shuts off flow to tubing 28 FIG. 1 . The function of the float valve, as will be apparent to one skilled in the art, and may be performed by other flow control means such as a level control operating a solenoid valve 63 shown in FIG. 6 . As disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,941,270, the bottle or bulk container 10 is appropriately sealed to maintain high purity of the liquid during shipment. As described herein the flexible liquid impervious sealing member 30 comprises first and second adjacent flexible discs 32 and 34 respectively. The first disc 32 may be provided with a centrally located circular perforation as shown by reference to U.S. Patent 3,941,270 and the second disc is imperforate and covers the circular perforation in the first disc.The circular pertoration in the first disc is provided so that the tip of the puncture mechanism 40 will enyaye the pertoration and carry the first disc 32 and adjacent second disc 34 away trom the top wall of the screw closure cap 17 so that after the discs are removed, they will not interfere with flow ot liquid from the container through the perforate portion 17a of the top wall 17b. A single flexible sealing disc may be used. However, a pair of discs is preferred. When more than one disc is used, the first disc 32 provides support for the second disc 34 and therefore may be less flexible than the second disc. The second disc 34 may be gas permeable so that if the liquid in the container produces gas upon exposure to heat or light, the gas will pass through. The sealing disc combination 30 may include additional elements. For example, when the secona disc is a thin gas permeable disc it may be disposed between third and fourth discs which are provided for structural support of the second disc with the third and fourth discs provided with centrally located slits, the third disc being in contact with the first end of the cylindrical member and the fourth disc beiny disposed between the first and second discs. The thickness, properties and character, e.g. gas permeability, of the seal elements are selected to provide the necessary protection under ambient conditions. Details of the sealing elements for the shipping container comprising the inner cap 17 and seal combination 30 of elements within the cap 17 are provided inU.S. Patent 3,941,270 which is incorporated herein by reference. In operation, the sealing member 30 may be removed from the open end of the bulk container 10 by applying pressure upon the sealing member 30. When such pressure is applied by the perforator 40, the sealing member disengages or is perforated thus permittiny communication through the perforate portion through the perforator 40 to the dispenser reservoir 21 from the bottle 1U. The pressure may be applied through the perforate portion by a hollow spike perforator 40 which is provided with openings 41 to permit entry ot liquid from the hollow portion into the hollow spike 40 for carrying the liquid through the hollow spike to the dispenser reservoir 21. The hollow spike 40 is conveniently attached to a supporting surface 22 by suitable means.The supporting fixture 22 is secured on the reservoir cover 23. As shown in FIG. 6 the solenoid operated level control 60 comprises a sensor 61 which is partially submerged and senses the liquid level 62. When the level falls below the predetermined level 62a, the level sensor 60 causes solenoid valve 63 to close until the liquid level is ayain raised, thus preventiny air from enteriny pipiny 28. FIG. 7 illustrates a cone shaped reservoir 65 provided with a valve 26a and discharye tube 28a which correspond in function to valve 26 and line 28 respectively described by reference to FIG. 1. Although the invention has been described and illustrated in connection with preferred embodiments, it will be understood that modifications and variations may be made without departing from the essence and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
