The gauge 50 includes a stone simulant 54 having a central axis and having sections corresponding generally to the culet, the girdle and the table of a brilliant cut diamond. A handle 52 is connected to the section of the stone simulant 54 corresponding to the table and extends in a direction generally parallel to the central axis. In the preferred embodiment, the handle 52 is generally cylindrical in shape and coaxial with the central axis.
