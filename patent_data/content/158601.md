## Description
A METHOD FQR FABRICATING PREFORMS FOR DRAWN OPTICAL FIBERS The present invention concerns a method for fabricating optical fiber preforms embodying glass powder. The e use of glass powder for fabricating optical fiber preform is known per se. Thus glass powder can be agglomerated and hot densified until they provide monolithitic glass masses, these being used as preforms to be subsequently transformed by drawing into optical fibers. It is also possible to deposit on a heated vitrified silica web at a relatively elevated temperature glass powder prepared in situ by the reaction of silicon halides and halides of other metals with reactive gases such as oxygen, hydrogen, water vapor and others. It is also possible to spray onto such heated web solutions of organo metallic reagents acting as glass precursors, such as silicon alkoxydes and other metal alkoxydes, the decarposition by heat of these reagents in the presence of solvents and reactive gases providing, at the surface of the web, a glass powder of controllable granulation according to the operating conditions.Subsequently, there is proceeded, as indicated above, to a hot densification of this powder into a monolithic glass mass, possibly in the presence of gases such as chlorine, N2 or hydrogen so as to accelerate the dehydroxylation of the particles. Such methods are particularly indicated when it is desired to obtain a preform with a radially variable refractive index. Indeed, if the coposition of glass powders doping by oxydes of metals different from silica which are deposited on a cylindrical web varies progressively in the course of the thickening of the deposited layer, there is obtained, after final densification, a glass matrix whose index varies as a function of the variation of the composition of the deposited powder.Naturally, the web can have any shape, solid cylinder or tube and, in this last case, the powder can be deposited on the internal surface thereof or on its external surface. If the coating concerns the inside surface, the variation of the powder composition corresponds to an increase of the doping rate, so that after densification, the glass has a refraction index higher at the center than at the outside indeed, such distribution of the indexes in the fiber biproves strongly the transmission efficiency of the signals in the fiber . If the coating concerns the external surface, it will be advantageous to use a strongly doped web and to deposit a powder whose doping ratio for instance with germanien is radially decreasing. The following references will provide further details on these prior art techniques JP 57 191,237 CA. 98, 184409 JP 80 20,243 CA. 93, 136723 Jap 80 23,067 C.A. 93, 136726 JP 80 23,068 C.A. 93, 136727 JP 80 23,066 C.A. 93, 119106 PROC EFOC 1980, 1st, 63 4 C.A. 95, 229124 JP 81 14,437 C.A. 95, 66582 JP 58 140,337 Ep A 86.132 JP 58 110,437 JP 58 104,039 JP 57 82,805 JP 57 38,329 JP 58 176,134 JP 58 64,234 JP 82 42,574 JP 56 73,640. These methods, although very efficient, have however sone drawbacks to which it is desirable to remedy. Thus, in the case where the coating involves powders generated by a reaction in the vapor phase or in a flame, or by spraying liquids at high temperature, it is necessary to use relatively ccSplicated and expensive spraying apparatuses. When the compacting and sintering of prefabricated glass powders is involved, it is difficult to obtain preforms with radially variable refractive indexes unless special moulds are used.Thus, recently, a technique has been described according to which a cylindrical mould is used with two compartments, one of those being arranged concentrically with regard to the other JP 80 71,637 C.A.93 209,132 . In order to fill these moulds, aqueous glass powder dispersion are used, the powder which forms the dispersion in the cerr tral mould having a refractive index higher than that of the powder used in the external mould. After elimination of the wall between the ccopartments, and partial concentration of the dispersions, the latter are converted into a gel which can be thereafter dried, evaporated and densified by heat according to usual means disclosed abide This technique, although very interesting, does not enable how ever to provide a preform with a graded refractive index the gra dient having preferably a parabolic profile , unless the mould is provided with multiple concentric corrpart nents which appears to be difficult to achieve constructionwise. The method of the invention, such as disclosed in claim 1, remedies these drawbacks by embodying, for the build up of successive glass layers with a refractive index which varies according to a determined profile, a coating technique which consists in impregnat ing a glass or silica porous body by a suspension of glass particles in a liquid. This method is particularly interesting because it involves the deposition of layers whose texture is, because of the very nature of the method, in connection with that of the web or original matrix on which the coating is effected.Indeed, one of the problems in the art, when effecting the densification of multilayers substrates with glass powder for manufacturing optical preforms, is connected with the intimate structure more exactly to the dimension of the pores of the material which constitutes this laminate. If pores are too fine, the progressive densification of the pdrous substrate into monolithic glass by evaporation of volatile material is difficult and there exists risks for the formation of fissures by bursting. Until now, the control of the grain structure or porosity of these catposite structures was little possible.The method of the invention removers such drawback because if it is indeed possible to control the porosity of the web, it is also possible to influence directly the texture of the coatings obtained by this technique, the degree of porosity of each layer being then controllable by acting on the operative parameters of the method. Besides, one of the notable advantages of the invention refers to the fact that, by reason of their porous structure, each new layer penetrates, by inafegna tion, into the previous one, which contributes to minimize the refractive index junction discontinuities during the densification of the preform elimination of the stair like jump in the gradient index curve . In the present process, the web is made of silica or porous glass which can be obtained by any known means moulding, pressure sintering, slip casting on a plaster preform, extrusion or also by spraying glass on a mandrel . The web constitutes advantageously a permanent part of the ccwposite to be densified and, in such a case, the glass of which it is made has an appropriate refractive index, low if the web is a cylinder which it is to be internally iRpregnat ed with successive layers whose index rises progressively, high if the web is a plain cylinder which is to be externally coated with successive layers of progressively decreasing refractive index. When there is provided a coating with several successive layers, the contacting of the substrate with a suspension of glass powder in a liquid slurry is simply repeated more than once, the previous layer having been dried and consolidated by a thermal treat ment and the refractive index of the powder of the new suspension being different fran that of the powder of the previous layer. The succession of said layers with indexes varying according to a predetermined pattern consequently determines the radial profile of the index of the preform once the latter is terminated, including its final sintering.It is of course evident that the exact shape of this profile deps not only on the indexes of the different layers which compose the preform but also on the number and the thickness of the latter, which parameters can be easily ajusted during each operation as will be seen hereinafter.In the present method, it is possible to control the thickness of the sedimented powder layer between about 10 m and 1 mm. The contacting of the web and the powder suspension can be made by dipping the web into the suspension or, if the latter is a hollcw cylinder, by filling the inside of the tube with the suspension and by maintaining these in contact for a convenient time in order that a layer of desired thickness is formed by diffusion of the liquid into the porous mass and consecutive agglomeration of the powder. If the web is a plain cylinder, it is also possible to set it into rotation and to coat it by spraying its surface with the suspension of glass powder. The glass powder, doped or not doped, which is used in the present method can be made by any known process melting, chemical vapor deposition, vapor phase deposition or others . It is however preferred, for high purity glasses, to use a powder which is obtained fran organo metallic compounds which are decomposed by the usual methods slre3dy menticrzK3d above and, more particularly, by the hydrolysis of metal alkoxydes sol gel technique . Thus, it is possible to use metal alkoxydes and proceed to the conversion thereof into oxydes by hydrolysis under well controlled conditions so as to convert them into oxyde particles of a determined grain size.It is possible, for instance, to spray an organic alkoxyde solution by means of a spraying pistol thus achieving droplets of known calibration and to hydrolyze these droplets in a moist atmosphere or also to spray this solution at the surface of a water mass maintained in agitation. It is also possible to prepare a dispersion of an alkoxyde solution in a hydrocarpatible solvent by agitating this solution in an inert medium, for instance a hydrocarbon insoluble in water, then slowing adding water to this dispersion emulsion so that the alkoxydes of each droplet of the discontinuous phase are hydrolyzed into solid particles of controlled dimensions, these particules being thereafter separated by filtration or centrifugation and finally hot densified. The e alkoxydes usable in this method are metal alkoxydes general ly used for fabricating very pure glasses according to the methods called sol gelR methods see for instance J. Mat. Sciences 13 1978 , 865 70 GB A 2,084,990 , theses methods being based on the controlled hydrolysis of metal alkoxydes and the polydehydrocondensation of the hydroxydes which are formed therefrom. Among such organo metallic compounds, the following ethoxydes, methoxydes, isopropoxydes and other lower alkoxydes of Si, Al, B, Ge, Mg, Zr, Ca, Cs, T1, etc.. can be mentionned.According to one embodiment, solutions of Si oE t 4 in alcohol are prepared with different proportions of Ge QEt 4, for instance of 1 to 10 moles these solutions are sprayed by mean of a spraying pistol into water where the particules of SiO2 doped with germanium instantaneously form by hydrolysis. The powder thus generated is collected by filtration or centrifugation then it is dried, for instance by means of a fluidized bed in the presence of an inert or reactive gaz such as N21 Ar, He, H2, C12, etc.. whose tewperature varies from 100 to 5000C.The particles whose size can be varied at wish between about 10 and 500 at are then dehydrated and converted into a glass powder with a doping ratio which varies as a function of the catposition of the starting alkoxyde solution. To achieve the suspensions slurries required for the emoody ing of the invention, the powder selected is suspended by agitation in a aqueous or non aqueous liquid. As aqueous liquids, water or aque ous solutions of hydrosoluble solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, THF, dioxane, polyethylene glycol PEG and others can be used.The slurry can advantageously contain, in addition, a small proportion of binders enabling the hardening and the consolidation of the deposited layer and a defloculating agent enabling to control viscosity of the dispersion and the rate of agglomeration of the par tickles. As binders, the following can be used cellulose derivatives hydroxy , methyl and carboxymethylcellulose and olefinic derivatives vinyl aloonol and the prepolymers thereof acrylic prepoly mers in emulsion, etc. .Preferably, the following binders can also be used, e.g. metal alkoxydes which, because they undergo gelation in the presence of the water of the liquid, will provide a phase which enables to cossolidate the structure of the deposited coating. As deflr ting agents, one can use ionic and anionic surfactants such as for instance fatty acid soaps, alkylarylsulfonic acids alkylben zene or toluene sulfonic acid , and polyoxyalkylene glycols. The weight ratio of the binding and defloculating agents with regard to the glass powder will advantageously be in the order of 0.01 to 2 . As non aqueous liquids, organic solvents can be used such as acetone, alcohal, benzene, toluene, trichlorethylene, isopropanol, etc.. in the presence of binders such as polyacrylic esters or polyvinylbutyral resins and defloculating agents such as glycerides of organosoluble synthetic surfactants. One can also advantageously use as binders for the doped glass powders metal alkosyde solutions whose chemical composition is iden tidal with or different from that used for the synthesis of the glass powders by the wsol gelw method. These alkcprydes which turn into a gel in the presence of water also penetrate by impregnation into porous silica before their gelation beomes effective. Cbnsequently, the variation of the refractive index which normally depends on the deposition of successive glass powder layers whose doping ratio varies progressively can also result from a variation of the composition of the metal alkoxydes used as binders. Naturally, one can combine the various effects mentioned above and, for the formulation of these slurry compositions, it is possible to vary simultaneously the glass powder composition and that of the various binders previously men tioned including that of the alkoxydes which subseently lead to the formation of a gel. The relative proportions of the glass powder, of the other additives and of the liquids in the suspensions intended for the coating of webs by impregnation will determine to a certain extent the nature, the thickness and the properties of the various coatings obtained. The operating technique enables also to influence these parameters. Thus, for instance, longer is the contact time between the substrate and the suspension, and the thicker becomes the coating in addition, by acting on the rate at which the excess of suspension is removed, it is possible to control the thickness of the coating.Generally speaking, one endeavours to maintain the level of the organic additives as low as possible although in a range compatible with the appropriate solidification of the coating after stage b .Indeed, the smaller the amount of the additives foreign to the glass material, the easier their elimination during the densification phase.In general, additive proportions of the order of 0.01 to 2 by weight are sufficient. Naturally, if the binding additives are exclusively metal alkoxydes, for instance Si CEt 4 only, or as mixtures with other doping alkoxydes, the ethanol formed by hydrolysis is eliminated during the drying phase with the other solvents and, in this case, the proportions of alkoxydes can markedly exceed the 2 by weight limit with regard to the glass powder or with regard to the total weight of the dispersion and attain values of 5, 10, 15 and 20 or more. In order to obtain the starting porous web, it is possible to use any method providing the texture and the form desired. Thus, the porous web is constituted by an agglomerate of glass powder more or less doped or of silica powder of which the cohesion is sufficient for it to be practically manipulated. For achieving such a porous web, it is for instance possible to compact the powder at low temperature according to the techniques generally used for shaping ceramics It is also possible to extrude the web according to a desired form and eliminate the binder used before achieving by inpregnation the successive layers which constitute the process of the present invention it is also possible, in the case of a tubular web, to use a casting technique with a plaster mould slip casting or to spray by the plasma spraying techni que glass powder on a mandrel. In this last case, the manufacture of the porous web is achieved by spraying the glass powder on the surface of a cylindrical bar subjected to rotation and possibly cooled during spraying by a stream of water.In order to enable the subsequent separation of the porous glass sheath thus obtained, the internal bar is coated with a film of a hydrosoluble mineral material, for instance an alibi metal salt thus, it is possible to easily separate the sheath fran the bar by dissolving the intermediate film in water. Naturally, the cohesion of the porous web can be improved by partial sintering open residual porosity according to usual techniques or any other method leading to the same kind of results . the tube web has been coated by impregnation with a layer of powdery glass, and after having eliminated the excess of suspension, the layer is dried by usual means, for instance by allowing it to stand for a time 1 24 hours for instance under a catposition and temperature controlled atmosphere during this time, the cohesion between the particles due to the hardening of the binder increases sufficiently for enabling subsequent manipulations thereof to be per formed. Generally speaking, the drying temperature is comprised between 20 and 350 C in air or in an inert gas, subject or not subject to agitation, in order to accelerate the removal of the volatile solvents. Once the powdery layer has sufficiently hardened so that the object can be manipulated easily, there is proceeded to the depositicn of a new layer by repeating the above mentioned operations. Then a new drying step is undertaken and thereafter the same procedure is repeated. When the desired number of layers has been attained, the final treatment of densification is undetaken by usual means which consists, as seen previously, to heat the preform slowly to minimize contra tion and to lead to final cosdensation into a transparent homogene ous glass with no discontinuities or cracks. The structure is then visually although, naturally, the glass thus obtained has a refraction index which varies radially according to a determined profile.In order to effect susb a densification, the composite is slowly heated in an inert or reactive atmosphere He, Ar, Ne, 02, , C12, etc.. or mixtures of these gases in order to complete the deshydroxylation and the total elimination of the organic materials alien to glass. In general, the heating rates are from 1 to several degrees per hour, the final temperatures being of the order of 900 to 12000C. The e following examples illustrate the invention in more detail. Example 1 Preparation of a glass powder doped with germanium. The following material were intimately mixed by operating under a purified dustfree atmosphere 312 g 1.5 moles of Si OEt 4, 24.2 g 0.1 mole of Ge t 4 and 400 ml of very pure ethanol. To this solution were further added 2.2 ml of acetylacetone and 0.5 ml ofN HCl. This solution was thereafter atomized and sprayed by means of a spray pistol, calibrated for obtaining droplets of about 50sum and the mist thus produced was projected into a vat full 6f water under agitation at room telrperature and at an ammonia controlled pH of 8 9. The e droplets solidified in water due to hydrolysis of the al koxydes and polycondensation of the hydrolysis product. After maintaining in agitation for about 30 min, the glass powder formed was drained on a glass filter and it was placed into a tube adapted to generate a fluidized bed by injection of a pressurized gas at the bottom part thereof. The powder was then maintained therein for about 5 6 hours under agitation in an oxygen stream at 3750C, this stream being optionaly completed by 10 to 20 v v of chlorine for accelerating the dehydroxylation of the particles and the oxydation of the last traces of the organic matters still possibly present. By repeating this example but incorporating into the mixture of the alkoxydes 1 ml of NH40H N and by spraying this mixture into water at pH 5 6 etc1 , similar results were obtained. The powder thus obtained was under the form of fine particles of size in the order of 30 to 60zum constituted of silica 94 mole doped with GeO2 6 mole . A pure silica powder was prepared identically by using a solution identical with that described above but containing only ethyl silicate and no tetraeEWyX germanate. Example 2 Preparation of a tubular matrix of porous silica. A cylindrical stainless steel tube of about 10 nun diameter and 40 an long was selected and this tube was rotated about 100 rpm between bearings provided with tight end joints and thus adapted to be circulated internalty by a stream of a cooling or heating liquid.The tube was heated to 1500C and a mist of particles generated by the ataization of an aqueous solution of 300 gfl of NaCl was sprayed, by means of a spraying pistol, an the rotating tube. There was thus obtained thereon an even film of powdered NaCl of fine texture and of a thickness of the order of 10 to 5OAflL The tube was thereafter cooled to 15 C by a circulating stream of water and, while maintaining it in rotation, silica powder of the type described in the previous example was sprayed on its surface in a series of horizontal passes, by means of a plasma pistol.The operating conditions were the followings 500 A 60 70 V ionized gas 80 15, v v gas flow about 1 standard m per hour rate flow of the powder about 2.2 kg per hour distance of projection 5 10 cm time of projection 3 5 min. There was thus obtained a porous glass sheath about 2 3 nun thick, the yield of coating being 20 to 30 . The tube covered with the sheath of silica was dipped into water, the sheath being released after a few minutes due to of the dissolution therein of the intermediate film of NaCl. Example 3 Deposition of a glass powder coating on the inside surface of a porous glass tubular web. A suspension of O g of glass powder doped with germanium was prepared according to the description of example 1 in 80 ml of a mixture 65 35 v,Ar of ethanol and water cOntaining 4 g of Si OEt 4 and 0.4 g of PEG 400. A tube of porous silica obtained according to examr ple 2 was filled with this suspension and, after 5 min rest at room temperature, the excess of suspension was allowed to slowly run out fram the bottom of the tube this effect being obtained by providing a very small opening at the lower end of the tube.The tube was allowed to dry in air for 24 hours, after which a slow current of oxygen was circulated therein at a temperature which was progressively raised in 10 hours to 6000C. Then the tube was placed in a furnace and its temperature was raised slowly 30C per hour by circulating therein a mixture He C12 80 20 v v until the value of 10500C is attained. After cooling, it was noticed that the tube was entirely converted by densification into a tubular transparent monolithic form. This tube was used for preparing, by hot drawing according the usual means, an optical fibre whose core had a refractive index higher than that of the periphery. Example 4 Preparation of an optical fibre with graded refractive index. The e previous example was repeated with the following differen ces after application of a first layer of powder doped with 3 mole of GeO2, drying was effected for 12 hours by progressively rais ing the temperature up to 3500C. The e coating treatment was thereafter repeated by impregnation with a silica suspension doped with 6 mole of GeO2 powder of example 1 then, after a new drying stage, it was once more iwpregnated by means of a powder doped with 10 mole of GeO2. After drying, hardening and densification as in example 3, there was obtained a tube comprising a sheath and 3 internally concentric successive glass layers whose index increases toward the center. After melt drawing this preform, there was obtained a glass fibre whose index varies radially correspondingly.
