Verfahren zur Herstellung eines Alkenoylisocyanats der Formel

## Description
The present invention relates to the production of alkenoyl isocyanates of the formula wherein X is a halogen atom. In general, compounds having an isocyanate group are widely used in the field of polymer chemistry because of their excellent reactivity. Compounds having both a polymerisable double bond and an isocyanate group in the molecule are expected to have great usefulness, because the double bond and the isocyanate group can respectively participate in various reactions depending upon different reaction mechanisms. Specific examples are vinyl isocyanate Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., Among them, the alkenoyl isocyanates I such as acryloyl isocyanate I R hydrogen and methacryloyl isocyanate I R methyl are particularly interesting in that the reactivities of the polymerizable double bond and the isocyanate group are enhanced by the carbonyl group present between them. The alkenoyl isocyanates I can thus undertake various reactions such as radical polymerization, anion polymerization, dimerization, trimerization, polar addition and addition of active hydrogen based on the partial structure A i.e. conjugated double bond structure and or on the partial structure B i.e. acylisocyanate structure as set forth below and may be used as the industrial starting materials in various chemical fields The alkenoyl isocyanates I were originally prepared by reacting the corresponding alkenoyl chlorides with silver isocyanate Chem. Ber., In 1962 to 1965, Speziale et al developed a process for production of acyl isocyanates from amides by reacting the latter with oxalyl chloride J. Org. Chem., wherein R and X are each as defined above to a certain extent is unavoidable so that the application of a troublesome purification procedure to the reaction mixture is needed. Diefenbach et al reported that the reaction of methacrylamide with oxalyl chloride at such a low temperature as 50 C gives 2 isopropenyloxazoline 4,5 dione hydrochloride III R CH₃ X Cl , in a yield of 76 Die Makromolekulare Chemie, It has been found that, when acrylamide is reacted with oxalyl chloride, the corresponding oxazolinedione hydrochloride III R H X Cl is not obtained even at such a low temperature as 50 C. Instead, β chloropropionyl isocyanate II R H, X Cl is obtained. According to the present invention, a process for producing an alkenoyl isocyanate of formula I comprises subjecting an oxazolinedione hydrohalide of formula III, wherein X is a halogen atom and R is H or C₁ ₅ alkyl, to decomposition in a liquid medium, under ambient pressure, and recovering the product. R is preferably C₁ ₃ alkyl e.g. methyl, ethyl or propyl and more preferably methyl. Halogen includes chlorine, bromine, iodine and fluorine chlorine and bromine, particularly chlorine, are preferred. Whereas the alkenoyl isocyanate I is normally liquid and quite sensitive to moisture, the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III is usually solid and relatively stable to moisture. Thus, the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III is suitable for storage on an industrial scale. Further, the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III can be readily separated from impurities such as unreacted oxalyl halide, so that the alkenoyl isocyanate I can be obtained in high purity and good yield. The oxazolinedione hydrohalides III wherein R is H are novel. They can be used as monomers, for the production of polymeric materials. The oxazolinedione hydrohalide III may be prepared by any process, but is preferably produced by reaction between an alkenylamide of the formula Surprisingly, the mere change of the charging order of the reagents into a reactor overcomes the given defects in the analogous process described by Diefenbach In the process of the invention, the alkenylamide IV is added portionwise, continuously or intermittently. The molar ratio of the alkenylamide IV to the oxalyl halide V is usually 1 1 3, preferably 1 1 1.5. No reaction medium is required, but its use is normally preferred for uniform and smooth processing of the reaction. Examples of the reaction medium are inert solvents such as hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, hexane , ethers e.g. diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and esters e.g. methyl acetate, ethyl acetate . Particularly preferred are halogenated hydrocarbons, of which specific examples are carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichloromethane, 1,1 dichloroethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, 1,6 dichlorohexane, 1,5 dichloropentane, 1,2 dichloropropane, 1,3 dichloropropane, 2,2 dichloropropane, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, 1,1,2 trichloroethane, 1,1,1,2 tetrachloroethane, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane, 1,4 dichlorobutane, 2,3 dichlorobutane, 1 chlorobutane, 2 chlorobutane, chlorobenzene, chlorocyclohexane, ethylene tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, pentachloroethane, chloropropane, 1,2 dichloroethylene, o , m or p dichlorobenzene, o , m or p chlorotoluene, 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene, bromobenzene, bromoethane, 1 or 2 bromopropane, 1 or 2 bromobutane, 1 or 2 bromopentane, o , m or p bromotoluene, bromocyclohexane, bromochloroethane and 1 bromohexane. When these inert solvents are used, either one or both of the alkenylamide IV and the oxalyl halide V may be previously dissolved or suspended therein. The reaction temperature is ordinarily from 50 C to the decomposition temperature of the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III , and preferably from 0 to 40 C. From the industrial viewpoint, the reaction is preferably conducted at room temperature or under ice cooling. For separation of the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III from the reaction mixture, any conventional separation procedure may be used, such as filtration or distillation under reduced pressure. Addition of seed crystals of the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III to the reaction mixture may sometimes help to accelerate the precipitation of the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III . However, separation of the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III from the reaction mixture is not necessarily required, provided that the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III is present in the reaction mixture. According to the primary process of the invention, the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III is then subjected to decomposition, to give the alkenoyl isocyanate I , while suppressing by production of the haloalkanoyl isocyanate II . The reaction is conducted under ambient pressure atmospheric or autogenic . As stated above, Diefenbach Decomposition can take place at as low a temperature as 40 C. The temperature is usually 40 to 150 C, preferably 60 to 120 C. The liquid medium may be any inert solvent, e.g. as exemplified above. The use of halogenated hydrocarbons as exemplified above is particularly preferred. The liquid medium preferably has a dielectric constant of not more than 4. Examples of such inert solvents are aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbons e.g. pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, decalin, cyclohexane , aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene , ethers e.g. propyl ether, butyl ether, dioxane, isopropyl ether , esters and halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. carbon tetrachloride . A dielectric constant of not more than 4 may be attained by the use of a single solvent or by the use of two or more solvents in combination. The decomposition is preferably conducted in the presence of a hydrogen halide eliminating agent, preferably an agent not having an active hydrogen atom or not giving an active hydrogen atom on reaction with a hydrogen halide. Amines which are in general the most popular hydrogen halide eliminating agents are not suitable for use in the process of this invention. Preferred hydrogen halide eliminating agents are metal complex compounds e.g. Ph₃P ₂Ru CO ₃, Ph₃P ₃Pt , metal halides e.g. lithium chloride, titanium tetrachloride, aluminium chloride, cuprous chloride and synthetic zeolite e.g. molecular sieve, microporous glass . The hydrogen halide eliminating agent is used normally in an amount of 0.1 to 100 mol, preferably of 0.1 to 10 mol. The decomposition may be effected by keeping the oxazolinedione hydrohalide III in the presence of the hydrogen halide eliminating agent at a temperature of 50 to 200 C, preferably from 0 to 150 C. Recovery of the alkenoyl isocyanate I from the reaction mixture may be accomplished by a per se conventional separation procedure such as filtration or distillation under atmospheric or reduced pressure. In any of the above reactions and the post treatments, a small amount of a polymerisation inhibitor may be incorporated into the reaction mixture, to prevent unnecessary polymerisation of the double bond. Examples of the polymerization inhibitor are hydroquinone, p methoxyphenol, 2,6 di t butyl 4 methylphenol, 4 t butylcatechol, bisdihydroxybenzylbenzene, 2,2 methylene bis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol , 4,4 butylidene bis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol , 4 4 thiobis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol , p nitrosophenol, diisopropylxanthogenesulfide, N nitrosophenylhydroxylamine ammonium salt, 1,1 diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazil, 1,3,5 triphenylpheldazyl, 2,6 di t butyl alpha 3,5 di t butyl 4 oxo 2,5 cyclohexadien 1 ylidene p trioxy, 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone 1 oxil, dithiobenzoyl sulfide, p,p ditolyl trisulfide, p,p ditolyl tetrasulfide, dibenzyl tetrasulfide, tetraethylthiuram disulfide, etc. The alkenoyl isocyanates I are, in general, obtained in a liquid stable at room temperature and therefore can be handled with ease. They are soluble in various organic solvents and can be used in their solution form. When allowed to stand in the air, they are readily reacted with moisture in the air to give the corresponding amides. This property is meritorious from the viewpoint of environmental pollution. Their double bond is very reactive and can be readily reacted with other compounds to give isocyanate derivatives. Further, for instance, the alkenoyl isocyanates I exert a strong antimicrobial activity in their gaseous state and therefore are useful as antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, the alkenoyl isocyanates I can participate in various chemical reactions due to the functional groups present therein and therefore can be used for production of starting materials and intermediates in the fields of pharmaceuticals, agro chemicals, dyestuffs, etc. Moreover, they have a wide use as monomers for production of various polymers. For instance, their copolymerization with styrene, alkyl acrylate, alkyl methacrylate or the like affords varnish resin. Further, for instance, their copolymerization with other monomers affords polymers useful as dyestuffs, adhesives, dipping agents, foaming agents, fiber treating agents, etc. In general, the alkenoyl isocyanates I wherein R is lower alkyl are more stable than the one wherin R is hydrogen particularly when heated.
