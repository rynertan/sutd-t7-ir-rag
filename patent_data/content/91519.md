## Description
TOPICAL ACYLAMINOPHENOLS Cross Reference to Related Applications This application is a division and continuation in part of our copending application Serial No. 92,296, filed November 8, 1979. Technical Field This invention relates to topical pharmaceutical composi tions for the treatment of cutaneous or mucous membrane disorders characterized by irritation or inflammation. More specifically, the invention comprises treatment of such disorders by topical application to the affected area of a selected acylaminophenol in a suitable vehicle. Background Art There are many steroidal drugs suitable for treating particular responsive dermatological disorders. They have a broad range of applicable biological activities e.g. cell membrane stabilization, vasoconstrictor activity, anti mitotic effect, suppression of DNA and protein synthesis, etc. . However, steroids often exhibit undesired local and systemic side effects when used for prolonged periods. These may be manifested in the form of local skin atrophy, or in adrenal atrophy in the most severe case. Furthermore, a reduction in host defense mechanisms to infection may accompany their use. Beyond the potential undesired side effects, steroids do not interact with the complete biological spectrum of inflammation. For example, ultraviolet UV light induced erythema is not amenable to treatment by steroidal anti inflammatories. UV induced early changes in skin such as vasodilation are relted to the conversion of arachidonic acid to E prostaglandins or to intermediate forms such asHETE 12L hydroxy 5,8,10,14 eicosatetraenoic acid or the endoperoxides which are vasoactive and are believed to have cutaneous activity, such as triggering hyperproliferative epidermal activity. See, for example, Bem, J. L.and Greaves, M. W. 1974 Prostaglandin E1 effects on epidermal cell growth in vitro. Arch. Derm. Forsch.251 35 41 Snyder, D. S. and Eaglstein, W.

S. 1974Naturally occurring and synthetic inhibitors of prostagland in synthetase of the skin. Prostaglandin SynthetaseInhibitors 353 361. Although it is not understood completely, it is thought that these effects related to prostaglandin biosynthesis are important components of many dermatopathologies, so a drug which will interfere with this biosynthesis should be useful in the clinical improvement of the disease.There are many non steroidal compounds or agents which also have anti inflammatory effects. Many of these are believed to act by blocking the prostaglandin synthetase complex of enzymes that are present in normal skin and are necessary for the biosynthetic processes described above.Furthermore, as a general rule, these drugs are relatively free of unwanted side effects. Examples of such nonsteroidal anti inflammatory compounds include aspirin, indomethacin, suprofen, cliprofen and ethyl 5 p chloro benzoyl l, 4 dimethylpyrrole 2 acetate. While many acylaminophenols, including the compounds employed in the treatment of the present invention, have been reported in the literature and used for a variety of purposes, to our knowledge, none have heretofore been reported to be useful as topical anti inflammatory agents.A review of Chemical Abstracts has revealed the following disclosures relevant to pharmaceutical activities of related aminophenols as well as pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical activities of the substituted aminophenols specified below as being useful in the topical compositions and methods of the present invention. CA 57 16492 1962 contains a report of anti rheumatic activity forN nicotinyl E aminophenol and N succinyl p aminophenol, and refers to Austrian Patent No. 222,647 1962 .p Aminophenol amides of sperm head oil acids and sperm blubber oil acids, mentioned in Netherlands PatentApplication No. 6,505,431 as having hypocholesterolemic activity, are reported at CA 64 14137 1966 . UnitedStates Patent No. 3,081,321 is reported at CA 60 2833 1964 to disclose analgesic activity of p aminophenol amides of aliphatic monocarboxylic acids.

In addition to inflammation, the prolifer ative response of the epidermis treated with arachidonic acid and the compositions was evaluated.Fourteen acylaminophenols were studied. The drugs were dissolved in propylene glycol plus ethanol 30 70 and were used at 1 concentrations unless otherwise stated.Fourteen groups of five guinea pigs each served as the experimental subjects. The dorsal skin of both ears was treated once daily for four days 9 00 am with 25l 1 solution of AA in propylene glycol ethanol 30 70 .Immediately after this application, one ear of each guinea pig was randomly chosen for application of 25jA1 of the test compound, while the contra lateral ear received the vehicle, alone. During the four day experimental period,DNA synthesized was labeled by continuous administration of a radioactive precursor, 3H thymidine 3 i.p.injections day of lOjACi each . Erythema developing in response to topical AA was measured daily on a subjective scale of O to 3 where 0 no ne, mild, 2 moderate, and 3 intense. The average erythema scores were plotted as a function of time, and areas under the response curves were determined for expression of total erythema. On the fifth day, animals were killed and six mm diameter circular samples of dorsal skin from the central portion of the treatment sites were harvested and solubilized in NCSs solubilizer. These tissue solutions were acidified and a simple fluor diphenyloxazole in toluene was added for determination of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting.Radioactivity expressed as counts per minute cpm correlate with the amount of proliferative activity in the epidermis. ResultsIt was found that topical application of acetamidophenol acetaminophen had no significant effect on AA induced erythema or proliferation. The application of 4 propionylaminophenol, 4 n tetradecanoylaminophenol or 4 n hexadecanoylaminophenol was also without substantial effect. Benzoylaminophenol, an example of a 4 acylamino phenol of an aromatic acid was also inactive in this model. It was found that 4 n butyroylaminophenol significantly inhibited AA .induced epidermal proliferation, but was without effect on erythema. The acylaminophenols with normal aliphatic side chains ranging from six to twelve carbon atoms showed good activity against both AA induced erythema and proliferation. These included 4 n hexanoylaminophenol, 4 n decanoylaminophenol, 4 n undecanoylaminophenol, and 4 n dodecanoylaminophenol, 4 n heptanoylaminophenol, 4 n octanoylaminophenol, and 4 n nonanoylaminophenol. In addition, the 4 acylaminophenol of salicylic acid 4 salicylaminophenol showed activity against both erythema and proliferation. These data are summarized in Table 1.
