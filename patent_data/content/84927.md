# Rolling mill.

## Abstract
A rolling mill comprising a roll housing 1 in which are mounted a pair of work rolls 2, 3 which can be bent by work roll benders 40, 41, 44, 45 and a pair of support rolls 5, 6 therefor which are displaceable relative to each other in their axial direction and are bent by support roll benders 50 53 . To minimize the size of the window of the rolling mill housing while including a plurality of mechanisms such as roll benders and means for roll displacement, said support roll benders 50 53 are disposed closer to the centre plane of the rolling mill than the work roll benders 40, 41, 44, 45 .
