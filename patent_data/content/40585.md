## Description
Machine and method for feeding power machines.This invention relates to a machine for feeding power machines by raising and positioning the pieces disposed in a suitable manner. The in vention also relates to a method for feeding power machines with oblong pieces which are raised by mobile means, pass by gravity on to fixed means, and are discharged from the upper fixed means.The invention al so relates to an operational system for the said object, using the nex machine according to the invention The machine according to the inven tion is able, by means of raising and parallel positioning, to load or feed pointed oblong pieces such as nails, needles, pinst bars and small items in general such as screws, rivets, rods and the like, and also in gots, billets and the like having a lengtWliameter ratio greater than 1, and in particular greater than 5.In the case of pieces in which said ratio ia equal to or less than 1, for example in the case of cylinders, heads, washers, weldnuts, plugs and the like, the machine can carry out the loading operation by raising, but cannot position the pieces, which because of their nature are either not positionable or positionable only to a small extent.From the prior art, three machines are known having the same purpose as the invention, but which base their operation on different principles.These machines are described hereinafter.Slat elevator machineSaid machine is composed of two parts, namely a hopper and a slat ele vator installed in the hopper, and of which the slats are inclined to a certain extent to the horizontal. As the elevator rotates, the slats withdraw the material from the hopper, so raising it. 3y this means pieces having a length diame ter ratio greater than 1 tena to become disposed parallel to the pla ne of the slat and positioned along its length, to then become dischar ged by gravity at the predetermined point, generally at a chute which conveys them to the user item. The said machine has the following drawbacks the raising speed is relatively low in order to enable the pieces to become positioned and to slide along the slats it has only one feed point, namely the loading point, where a cer tain number of pieces disposed in a disordered manner are collected, and frequently some of these are not disposed parallel to the slats loading difficulties for small diameter pieces or pieces with poin ted ends, in that the elevator comprises relatively large gaps which tend to collect the pieces, so blocking their rotation. Rotating blade elevator and positioning machine Said machine is composed of two parts, namely a hopper and a rotating drum to which blades are fixed for raising the pieces withdrawn from the hopper, to cause them to fall in bulk on to guides and or rollers which convey them to the user item. The machine has the following drawbacks low raising height in order not to have to use drums of excessive diameter random positioning, because the pieces fall in bulk on to the guides or rollers Automatic vibration distributors Automatic vibration distributors are generally constituted by a base containing the vibrator, and a circular container fixed to the base, which acts as a store for the pieces to be loaded. The vibration transmitted to the container causes the pieces to become positioned and disposed on suitable tracks which convey them to the user item. The drawbacks are as follows large overall dimensions, high noise level the same machine cannot be used for loading different pieces.The present invention obviates the aforesaid drawbacks of known machines of the slat, rotating blade and vibration type, and has many advan tages which will be apparent to the expert from the description given hereinafter. The machine according to the present invention is consti tuted by a series of steps disposed in the from of a stairway, each step being formed from a mobile part and a fixed part. These parts will be referred to as the mobile step and generally as the mobile means and the fixed step and generally as the fixed means . More particularly, the machine is constituted essentially by a series of n fixed steps and n l mobile steps, which can be driven with reciprocating motion in a direction verying from the vertical to approximately horizontal by means of a suitable drive unit.In the case of vertical or inclined motion, the machine raises and positions the oblong pieces, and in the case of horizontal motion the machine pushes the pieces without positioning them.When the mobile steps are in their bottom and top dead centre position, they form, in cooperation with the surfaces of the fixed steps, the tread of the stairway steps.Both the mobile and fixed steps can be constituted by hollow plates in order to lighten them.During each cycle of the reciprocating motion, the pieces are raised by the mobile steps and deposited on to the next upper fixed step, while those of the top step are conveyed by a suitable chute to the conveying unit. In order to facilitate passage of the material from the fixed steps to the mobile steps and to the discharge chute, the machine can be inclined at a suitable angle, for example from IC to 300. The steps, which are preferably modular, can be of any number, and this will depend in particular on the behaviour of the material to be raised and positioned and or on the required height of raising.Prom the aforegoing, it follows that the machine need be provided with only a single step to give the minimum operability conditions, and the machine can then be modified according to requirements by mounting other modular steps thereon, so gradually increasing its raising and positioning capacity, while maintaining the amplitude of the reciprocating motion constant, and keeping the same base structure.The gap between the mobile and fixed steps can be kept preferablybe tween 0.05 and 0.1 mm, so preventing pieces of small diameter from entering the gap and hindering the machine motion.The step dimensions are obviously a function of the piece dimensions.In general, with pieces having a length diameter ratio greater than 1 and a length of between 5 and 100 mm, the dimensions of the tread of the stairs are for example as follows thickness of both mobile and fixed steps from 5 to 50 mm width of both mobile and fixed steps from 50 to 500 mm height i.e. stroke of the reciprocating motion from 1 in the case of very small diameter objects, to 250 mm and beyond. The advantages of the machine according to the invention over those of the known art are as follows a feed speed considerably greater than that of known machines b individual separation of the bulk fed pieces as described in grea ter detail hereinafter with ideal positioning thereof by the effect of the different positioning stages c possibility of feeding pieces of small diameter and of large length diameter ratio d possibility of feeding pieces with pointed ends such as nails, nee dles, pins, rivets, screws, rods, various preforms etc. e constant modular step elevation pitch. Possibility of different suitable constructional heights and widths of the step, and consequently of the points of selection in accor dance with technical1 operational and constructional requirements of the power machine to be fed, and of the shape of the piece to be fed, f modularity of the loading system from 1 to n steps. Possibility of modular assembly of the mobile steps and of the re spective fixed cross members to obtain an optimum number of selec tions in accordance with the difficulties of the piece to be posi tioned for its efficient feed g absolutely no noise h very small overall dimensions in relation to its considerable feed potential i because of and as a consequence of the easy modularity of the mul tiple step system, the machine also assumes the characteristic of a conventional elevator, and is also particularly suitable for com pensating large height differences.In addition to the alreadvr described elevator and positioning machine, the present invention also comprises a system for feeding power machi nes, comprising, in succession, a feed unit, the elevator and positioning machine, and a conveying unit of roller and or guide type, in which the feed unit is constituted essentially by a loading hopper containing the pieces in bulk and provided with devices such as chutes, guides, and channels for transferring the pieces into a weighing device which causes the feed flow from the loading hopper to stop when the scheduled quantity of pieces has filled the weighing device which is located in a position corresponding with the first step of said new elevator and positioning unit.Pre positioning is provided by disposing the feed path for the pieces parallel to the fixed and mobile means.The invention is further described by way of non limiting example from the following figures, in which t Figure 1 is a cross section through the machine according to the inven vention.Figure 2 is an elevational view of the machine of Figure 1Figures 3, 4 and 5 are diagrammatic representations of the machine of the preceding figures when in its top dead centre position, its mobile parts being respectively shown inclined, inclined but with a difference in level between the fixed and mobile parts, and straight up but with the fixed and mobile parts bevelled in order to facilitate discharge of the materialFigure 6 represents the machine of the preceding figures, but with the last two steps being provided with a double incline in order to discharge the pieces laterallyFigure 7 shows the machine of the preceding figure, but with the fix ed steps provided with spaced apart raised portions to allow selection of the pieces.The machine shown by way of example is composed of two side pieces 1 and 2 joined together by six fixed steps 3 to 8 which act as spa cers.Guide rods 13 and 14 are fixed to the cross members 11 and 12, which are fixed to the side pieces 1 and 2 of the machine, and to the side piece 1 there is also fixed the pin 9, which is inserted into the support 10 of a power machine, which is fed by the machine according to the invention but is not shown in that it does not form part of the invention.The elevator sssembly 15 which comprises the six mobile steps 3 to 8 is guided by the rods 13 and 14 in its vertical reciprocating movement.The reciprocating movement is obtained by means of a geared motor 16 connected to the crankshaft 17 by the belts 15 which cause the crank pin 19 to rotate, and by way of the connecting rod 20 which is connected to the pin 21.During each machine cycle, the material disposed on the steps is rai sed on to the step above, and at the top end is discharged through the chute 25 to feed a power machine.The discharge takes place by inclinating the machine of Figure 2 to the right of the drawing at a suitable angle.The machine is fed as stated heretofore, through the mouth 22 which is separated from the hopper, which is not shown.By means of a vibrators not shown, the hopper discharges at the appropriate time a certain quantity of pieces into the weighing mouth which, because of the weight of the pieces, is lowered until it touches the limit switch 23 which stops the vibrator and consequently the feed flow of the pieces from the hopper.When the predetermined quantity of pieces contained in the mouth has been taken by the machine, the mouth rises again, so connecting the vibrator, which carries out the next filling of the mouth.The following modifications, considered either individually of in combination, can be made to the machine heretofore described in order to better adapt it to the type of pieces and the material of which they are constituted a as shown in Figure 3 the machine is inclined for example at 15 200 to facilitate discharge of the pieces. The inclination can however lie between 5 and 900, at this latter inclination the machine acting as a pusher b if during their vertical rising stroke the mobile steps pass beyond the fixed steps by for example 2 3 mm, and likewise if during their descending stroke they fall below the fixed steps by 2 3 mmt both the discharge and charging time are extended, so increasing the ele vating capacity of the machine and its discharge capacity.If the machine is then also inclined, as shown in Figure 4, the machine ca pacity is flother increased. The level difference between the steps can lie between 2 and 40 mm. c the upper surfaces of the fixed and mobile steps can be inclined at for example 200 as shown in Figure 5, or such other inclination as to enable the machine to be disposed in a vertical position, with a consequent reduction in its overall plan dimensions d by further shaping the profile of the upper surfaces of the two steps 30 and 31 as a hog s back as shown in Figure 6 , it is possible to direct the discharge flow along two separate paths according to requi rements e by further disposing suitable apertures 34 on the fixed step 32, the mobile steps being indicated by 33 as shown in Figure 7 , the pieces can be selected according to their length, and it becomes possible to discharge the pieces at predetermined points. It is apparent that further modifications can be made to the present inven tion, all of which lie within the scope of the inventive idea.
