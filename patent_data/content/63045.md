# COMBINED MODE SUPERVISORY PROGRAM PANEL CONTROLLER METHOD FOR AN INDUSTRIAL PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A method for operating a distributed industrial process control system permits a system operator to configure from a control point the overall system architecture so as to control the sequential operation of the entire system or a sub portion thereof. A program panel controller includes a first user accessible graphic program by which the system architecture can be symbolically reconfigured and a second user accessible instruction set program by which the operat ing parameters of the system or a sub portion thereof may be altered in accordance with a symbolic configuration set into the controller.
