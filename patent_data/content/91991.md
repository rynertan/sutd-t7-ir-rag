# HEAT EXCHANGER FOR COAL GASIFICATION PROCESS

## Abstract
A heat exchanger 6 for cooling hot particulate solids, such as the separated fines from the product gas of a car bonaceous material gasification system including a tube 20 with a core 24 and vanes 28 in a cavity 26 between the core 24 and the tube 20 which form a flow path for the hot particulate, the outside of the tube 20 being in contact with a cooling fluid. This arrangement provides for effective cooling of a hot particulate in a particle stream, using gravity as the motive source of the hot particulate.
