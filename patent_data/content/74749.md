DETAILED DESCRIPTION This invention relates to certain pyrazoles useful as herbicides. In particular these inventions relate to pyrazoles having the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is CL C4 haloalkyl or Row , wherein R is C1 C2 alkyl ene or C2 alkylidene and R5 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, C2 C5 alkanoyl, aroyl, C8 C10 aralkanoyl, C7 C9 aralkyl, phenyl, or phenyl substituted with C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, trihalomethyl, hydroxy, cyano or nitro or benzoyl substituted with halogen, C C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, trihalomethyl, hydroxy, gano or nitro R is C1 C4 alkyl, C5 C6 cycloalkyl, C7 Cg aralkyl, C7 Cg alkaryl, phenyl, naphthyl or a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic group con taining oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, or R2 is phenyl substituted with halogen, trihalomethyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, hydroxy or cyano Y is oxygen or sulfur, R3 is C1 C4 alkyl, C2 C4 alkenyl, C3 C4 alkynyl, C2 C6 alkoxyalkyl or C2 C6 alkylthioalkyl R4 is hydro gen, C1 C4 alkyl or trihalomethyl provided that R2 is not 3,4 dialkylphenyl or 3,4 dihalophenyl. R is preferably methylene. The pyrazole compounds of the invention may be used for the control of various grasses and broadleaved weeds including pig weed Amaranthus retroflexus L. , jimsonweed Datura stramonium L. barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgali L. Beauv. , and green foxtail Setaria viridis L. Beauv. Application may be in aqueous solutions or suspensions which may be sprayed onto the weed foliage or thc soil surface prior to weed and crop emergence and before or after the crop seed is sown. The compounds of this invention may also be applied by broadcasting o a granular formulation prior to weed and crop emergence. Compounds of this invention may be added as a tank mix to other herbicide solutions so that the number of different weed species controlled in a single application will be increased. The formulations of the compounds of this invention can also include other herbicides so that the spectrum of weeds controlled by spray or granular application may be broadened. The procedures for using the present substituted pyrazoles of this invention as herbicides can be in accordance with conventional agricultural practice. The chemicals are ordinarily applied as formulations containing a carrier and or surface active agent. The formulation can contain one or more of an effective amount of the described substituted pyrazoleS if desired other active herbicides may be included in the formulation as well. Thus, the pyrazole compounds can be impregnated on finely divided or granular inorganic or organic carriers such as attapulgite clay, sand, vermiculite, corn cobs, activated carbon or other granular carriers known to the art. The impregnated granules can then be spread on the soil. Furthermore, the pyrazole compounds can be formulated as a wettable powder by grinding it into a fine powder and mixing with an inactive powdered carrier to which a surface active and or dispersing agent has been added. Typical powdered solid carriers are the various mineral silicates, e.mica, talc, pyrophyllite and clays. The wettable powder may then be dispersed in. water and sprayed on the soil surface or weeds.Similarly, an emulsifiable concentrate may be prepared by dissolving the chemical in a solvent such as benzene, toluene, or other aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons to which a surface active dispersing agent has been added The emulsifiable concentrate may then be dispersed in water and applied by spraying. Suitable surface active agents are well known to those skilled in the art and reference may be had to McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers, 1980,Allured Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey or Hoffman et al. U.S. patents 2,614,916, cols. 2 to 4 and 2,547,724 cols. 3 and 4, for examples of appropriate surface active agents which patents are incorporated herein by reference. The concentration of active compound in the formulation may vary widely, e.g., from 1 to 95 .For use as a preemergence herbicide, the compound is applied in a carrier to soil which contains weed and crop seed either to the surface of the soil or incorporated into the upper 2.5 to 7.6 cm of soil The compounds of the present invention are especially active as postemergence herbicides. When used as a postemergence herbicide, the compound is applied in a carrier to the foliage of plants to be controlled. These compounds are most active when applied to dicotyledenous weeds less than 5 cm tall and monocotyledenous weeds less than 12 cm tall. The most suitable rate of application in any given case will depend on such factors as soil type, soil pH, soil organic matter content, the quantity and intensity of rainfall before and after treatment, the air and soil temperature, light intensity, light duration per day, plant size at time of treatment, and plant species.All of these factors have an influence on the efficiency of the chemicals for use as herbicides. The rate of application can range from 0.5 to 12 kg per hectare preferably treatment is at about 1 to 6 kg ha. The advantages of the novel herbicides of this invention may be more readily appreciated by reference to the following examples EXAMPLE 1Preparation of Methyl 1 hydroxmethyl 3 or 5 methyl S or 3 phenyl 1H pyrazole 4 carboxylate.

The solution was diluted to 100 ml with distilled water.Twenty milliliters of this 6000 ppm solution was diluted to 250 ppm with distilled water. The chemical was applied at the rate of 11.2 kg ha kilograms per hectare by drenching 46 ml of the 250 ppm solution on the surface of soil in 11.4 cm diameter plastic pots which had been sown with the following weed seeds velvetleaf Abutilon theophiasti Medic. jimsonweed Datura stramonium L. , tall morningglory Ipomea purpurea L. Roth , switch grass Panicum virgatum L. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli L. Beauv. and green foxtail Setaria viridis L. Beauv . The percent control of the weeds compared to untreated checks was determined two weeks after treatment. Table II shows the results with the preemergence herbicides of the invention prepared in accordance with the above samples. EXAMPLE 37 To illustrate effectiveness of the described pyrazole derivatives as postemergence herbicides, the 6000 ppm solution described under Example 36 was atomized with a number 152 DeVilbiss sprayer, wetting the foliage to the drip point. The weeds, which are the same species as described under Example 36, were treated six days after emergence. The percent control was evaluated two weeks after treatment. Table III shows the results with the postemergence herbicides of the invention. EXAMPLE 38 To illustrate efficacy at 11.2 kg ha preemergence, 250 ppm solutions were drenched onto the soil surface at the rate of 80 ml per 15.2 cm diameter pot. A rate of 1.12 kg ha required 25 ppm.The seeds of several weed species were sown into the soil of each pot prior to chemical application. The percent control of weeds compared to untreated checks was determined two weeks after emergence. Table IV shows the results of efficacy tests at rates of 11 2 and 1.12 kg ha. EXAMPLE 39 To illustrate efficacy postemergence at rates less than 6000 ppm, the solutions described in Example 36 were diluted to 4000, 2000, 1000, 500, 250 and 125 ppm with distilled water and applied to the plant foliage as described in Example 2. TABLE V illustrates the results of postemergence application at rates lower than 6000 ppm. EXAMPLE 40 Selectivity of a herbicide is desirable since it allows control of weeds growing among desirable crop plants. To illustrate the usefulness of the compounds of this invention as selective postemergence herbicides, 400 mg chemical was dissolved in 10 ml organic solvent such as acetone containing 25 mg conventional emulsifying agent e. g., ethoxylated sorbitan monolaurate Tween 20 trademark and diluted to 50 ml with distilled water. This solution was sprayed at the rate of 2.24 kg active in 280 liters of water per hectare onto the foliage of plants growing in 15 x 20 flats.Lower rates were achieved by dilution with distilled water. For example, the solution for 2.24 kg ha diluted 50 with water pro duced the solution for 1.12 kg ha. The percent weed control and crop injury were evaluated three weeks after treatment. TABLE VI illustrates the usefulness of these chemicals as selective postemer gence herbicides.
