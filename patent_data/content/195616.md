## Description
This invention relates to a current collector such as a pantograph for an electric car or tramcar, and more particularly to a support structure comprising bow members resiliently supporting a plurality of divided sliding plates. A current collector referred to hereinafter pantograph for an electric vehicle has been used for collecting electric current from trolley wires into the vehicle smoothly. In order to slide trolley wires on sliding plates mounted on bow members, a framework of the pantograph for supporting the bow member or members is urged toward the trolley wires by spring forces so as to force the sliding plates against the wires through the bow members. In the event of a vehicle running at high speeds or trolley wires arranged with insufficient accuracy, sliding portions of the pantograph may be often loss of contact with the wires to generate arcs. The generated arcs will directly shorten service life of sliding portions of the wires and the pantograph, and moreover give electric wave jamming to areas along a railway to lower the life environment therein as the case may be. Accordingly, the occurrence of the arcs should be restrained as possible. In order to prevent the arcs, it is needed to improve followability of the pantograph so as not to be loss of contact with the wires. For this purpose, attempt has been made to make the mass of movement of the pantograph as small as possible. An example of improved followability will be explained as disclosed in Japanese Utlity Model Applica tion Publications Nos. 150,672 83 and 38,726 85. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of plan and side views, two bow members 4 are usually connected by connecting arms 6 to form a unitary bow member assembly which is mounted to a framework unit not shown through springs. A plurality of sliding plates 1a and 1b in a row are supported through springs 8 on the one bow member. Auxiliary sliding plates 3 are fixed on upper surfaces of ends of the bow member. One end of the sliding plate 1a at each end of the bow member in opposition to the auxiliary sliding plate 3 pivotally movably connected to the bow member 4 by means of a pin 9. The other end of the sliding plate 1a and one end of the intermediate sliding plate 1b adjacent thereto are connected by an elastic connecting member 7 to keep upper surfaces of all the sliding plates 1a and 1b in one plane. Shunts 10 extend from the respec tive sliding plates 1a and 1b to the bow member 4 for collecting current. The bow member assembly as above constructed is mounted on the framework unit not shown to force the sliding plates against trolley wires 5 by means of main springs not shown . The dynamic action of the sliding plates 1a and 1b and the trolley wires 5 in this arrangement will be expalined. If the trolley wires 5 are arranged in parallel with in moving directions of the vehicle, the wires slide on substantially the same portions of the sliding plates to cause concentrated wearing to form grooves. Accordingly, trolley wires are arranged zigzag and distances between the wires and rails on which the vehicle runs are maintained as constant as possible. However, it is impossible to keep the distance absolutely constant. In actual case, while the trolley wires are caused to reciprocatively move in longitudinal directions of the bow member relatively when the pantograph moves because of the zigzag arrangement of the wires, thereby keeping the surfaces of the sliding plates in contact with the wires to collect the electric current. In order to improve the followability of the sliding plates 1a and 1b to the wires 5, the mass of movement of the sliding plates is made smaller to increase the following acceleration corresponding to the decrease of the mass. Accordingly, the sliding plates 1a and 1b are maintained following to the trolley wires with the aid of the increased acceleration even if vibrations with larger amplitudes occur, so that smooth current collecting is effected without causing bad phenomena such as arcs. In this manner, with the current collector as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the sliding plates are divided into a plurality of plates 1a and 1b supported by the springs 8 so as to make light the portions in contact with trolley wires 5, thereby increasing the follow ability of the collector. The above collector of the prior art gives rise to two problems. The first problem is occurrence of difference in height between adjacent ends of the sliding plates 1a and 1b when a trolley wire moves from one to the other. As shown in Fig. 3, when the trolley wire 5 arrives at a tail end of the sliding plate 1a , pressing force of the wire 5 directly exerts on the sliding plate 1a , while the pressing force indirectly exerts on the sliding plate 1b through the elastic connecting member 7. If the connecting member 7 were completely rigid, the force acting upon the sliding plate 1a would be equally transmitted to the sliding plate 1b without causing any difference in height between adjacent ends of these plates. However, such a rigid connection therebetween would contradict the object of the divided light weight sliding plates. In order to dynamically separating masses of the adjacent sliding plates 1a and 1b as aimed in the above, the elastic connecting member 7 should be made of a material having very flexible spring characteristics. With such a flexible connecting member, however, the force acting upon the sliding plate 1a is not transmitted to the sliding plate 1b , so that a great vertical difference between the sliding plates 1a and 1b is caused. Accordingly, the trolley wire 5 cannot be smoothly transferred from the sliding plate 1a to the sliding plate 1b . On the other hand, adjacent ends of the sliding plates 1a and 1b are formed angularly relative to the longitudinal directions of the bow members 4 to cause parts of the adjacent ends to be overlapped as shown in Fig. 1 in order to avoid the above great difference in height of the sliding plates. However, it cannot solve this problem. The spring characteristics of the elastic connecting members 7 are determined by the relation between the sliding plates. At any rate, the flexiblity of the elastic connecting member 7 is needed. Therefore, the difference in height between the sliding plates directly and indirectly subjected to the pressing force cannot be avoided, and causes groove shaped wearing at these ends and vibration resulting from the difference in height. The second problem results from the fact that sizes of the divided sliding plates are not sufficiently small because of limitation by sizes of the other components, and the effect brought about by the division of the plates is substantially limited due to unavoidably increased masses of parts needed for the division of the plates. In other words, as shown in Fig. 2, the elastic connecting member 7, springs 8, the pin 9, the shunt 10 and the like are necessary for supporting the sliding plates 1a and 1b . Lengths of the sliding plates 1a and 1b cannot be shorter than a length which is the sum of longitudinal lengths of these members. Moreover, the reduction of widths of the sliding plates is limited owing to requirement of strength and constructional reason. Particularly, the elastic connecting member 7 cannot be shortened because it is absolutely needed to have an effective spring length ℓ owing to required spring characteristics in addition to required strength. Accordingly, the sizes of the divided sliding plates 1a and 1b cannot be made small, and reversely the masses of the elastic connecting member 7, the spring 8, the pin 9, the shunt 10 and the like are increased, and as the result, to decrease the reliability and increase the cost. It is a principal object of the invention to provide an improved sliding plate support structure for a current collector, which eliminates all the above disadvantages of the prior art. It is a further object of the invention to provide a sliding plate support structure for a current collector, whose followability to current supply wires is improved by using very small units of divided sliding plate pieces and reducing masses of movement of the pieces while preventing the steps or differences in height at adjacent ends of the pieces and preventing groove shaped wearing and vibration at the adjacent ends of the pieces. In order to achieve this object in a sliding plate support structure for a current collector including at least one bow member elastically supporting plural sliding plates which are in contact with current supply wires, according to the invention the structure comprises a number of sliding plate pieces formed by dividing said sliding plates and arranged at least in two rows in longitudinal direction of said bow member such that adjacent ends of said sliding plate pieces in one row are shifted in the longitudinal direction with respect to adjacent ends of said sliding plate pieces in the other row, and a leaf spring body made of an electrically conductive elastic material having sliding plate fixing portions each for fixing thereon said sliding plate pieces in one row and detachably mounted to said bow member. In a preferred embodiment, adjacent ends of the sliding plate pieces in each row are oblique with respect to moving directions of a vehicle using the current collector. In another embodiment of the invention, the leaf spring body is provided on both sides with the sliding plate fixing portions and along its center with a mounting portion for detachably mounting the leaf spring body on the bow member and formed between the sliding plate fixing portions and said mounting portion with elongated openings in alignment with longitudinal directions of the leaf spring body to form support spring portions in alignment in traverse directions with the sliding plate pieces to be arranged on the nearest sliding plate fixing portions. The leaf spring body is curved at the support spring portions and detachably mounted with the mounting portion on the bow member. Portions of the sliding plate fixing portions of said leaf spring body corresponding to adjacent ends of said sliding plate pieces are preferably formed into inverted Ω shaped loops and the openings nearest in traverse directions are connected with each other by slots formed in the mounting portion. The inverted Ω shaped loops may be polygonal such as square. The inverted Ω shaped loops of the leaf spring body preferably have initial spring forces acting inwardly to force the sliding plate pieces associated therewith abutting against each other. Surfaces of adjacent ends of said sliding plate pieces are so inclined to form a triangular space therebetween diverging toward each the inverted Ω shaped loop that upper edges of the adjacent ends are normally in line contact with each other by the initial force of the inverted Ω shaped loop of the leaf spring body. In a further embodiment, the leaf spring body is provided on both sides with mounting portions for detachably mounting the leaf spring body on the bow member and formed in a center with the sliding plate fixing portions. The leaf spring body is formed between the sliding plate fixing portions and the mounting portion with elongated openings in alignment with longitudinal directions of the leaf spring body to form support spring portions in alignment in traverse directions with the sliding plate pieces to be arranged on the nearest sliding plate fixing portions. The leaf spring body is formed in the center between the sliding plate fixing portions with apertures each extending over substantial width of the center, thereby separating masses of movement of the sliding plate pieces in the one row and the other row and the leaf spring body is curved at the support spring portions and detachably mounted with the mounting portion on the bow member. In one embodiment of the invention, each the sliding plate piece is formed on one end and the other end with a projection and a recess which are fitted with each other with clearances when the sliding plate pieces are arranged in one row, and the leaf spring body consisting of a flat leaf spring supporting the sliding plate pieces thereon and U shaped springs for the respective sliding plate pieces. These and other objects, advantages, features, and uses will become more apparent as the description proceeds, when considered with the accompanying drawings in which Figs. 4, 5 and 6 illustrate one embodiment of the invention. Two bow members 4 only one shown in the drawings are connected by connecting arms 6 to form a unitary body and mounted in a framework of a pantograph so as to urge sliding plates on upper surfaces of the bow members 4 against trolley wires 5 for an electric car by forces of springs. A great number of sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c are contiguously arranged in two rows on the bow member 4 in its longitudinal directions. Adjacent ends of the pieces in one row are shifted in the longitudinal direction with respect to adjacent ends of the pieces in the other row so as not to be aligned with each other in transverse directions. The sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c are fixed to a continuous elastic stainless steel plate as by welding. However, any other plate like elastic material may be used such as phosphor bronze or the like so long as it has spring action, stainless property and good electric conductivity. The above stainless steel plate is formed as a leaf spring body 2 as a unitary body detachably resiliently supported on the bow member 4 at locations corresponding to the sliding plate pieces. Fig. 7 is a development view of the leaf spring body 2 which is provided on both sides with sliding plate fixing portions 2a each for fixing a number of the adjoining sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c in a row on the leaf spring body 2. The leaf spring body 2 is further provided along its center with a mounting portion 2c having female screw members 2d fixed thereto by welding for fixing the leaf spring body 2 to the bow member 4 by means of bolts 11. The leaf spring body 2 is formed integrally with the sliding plate fixing portions 2a, the mounting portion 2c and support spring portions 2b connecting between the mounting portion 2c and the sliding plate fixing portions 2a at every sliding plate pieces. The leaf spring body 2 having such a configura tion is formed into opposed U shapes so as to cause the support spring portions 2b to be semicircular as shown in Fig. 6. As above described, the adjoining ends of the sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c in the right and left rows are shifted so as not to be aligned with each other in running directions of a vehicle. In more detail, in order to form the support spring portions 2c, elongated rectangular openings 2e are formed by punching, so that the rectangular openings 2e on the left side are aligned with the support spring portions 2b on the right side, and the rectangular openings 2e on the right side are aligned with the support spring portions 2b on the left side in the running directions of the vehicle not shown as in Fig. 7. The leaf spring body 2 supporting the sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c thereon in unison is resiliently mounted on the bow member 4 by means of bolts 11. The outermost sliding plate pieces 1b and 1c on both sides of the bow member 4 have outer ends which are oblique relative to the running directions of the vehicle. The leaf spring body 2 has also oblique ends at ends of the sliding plate fixing portions 2a as shown in Fig. 7. An auxiliary sliding plate 3 is fixed to the bow member 4 and has a triangular end mating with the oblique ends of the outermost sliding plate pieces 1b and 1c and overlapping the pieces 1b and 1c in the running directions of the vehicle. Parts of the overlapping portions of the sliding plate pieces 1b and 1c and the auxiliary sliding plate 3 are chamfered relative to a horizontal plane in order to achieve smooth movement of trolley wires 5 on these members. In this case, the wire 5 scarcely slides on the auxiliary sliding plate 3 beyond the outermost sliding plate pieces 1b and 1c. Fig. 8 is an enlarged side view of the proximity of sliding plate pieces for explaining how to move these members when a wire 5 slides thereon in the sliding plate support structure of a current collector according to this embodiment. Assuming that a trolley wire 5 has arrived at an end of a first sliding plate piece 1a 1 adjacent to an end of a second sliding plate piece 1a 2, the pressing force of the wire 5 of course acts directly on the piece 1a 1 and indirectly on the piece 1a 2 through a sliding plate fixing portion 2a. At the same time, the force acts directly on a third sliding piece 1a 3 fixed to a sliding plate fixing portion 2a on opposite side to the above sliding plate fixing portion 2a. As adjacent ends of the sliding plate pieces on the side of the third sliding piece 1a 3 are shifted from the adjacent ends of the first and second sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2, the pressing force of the wire 5 acts on the third sliding piece 1a 3 substantially at its center at the moment shown in Fig. 8. As to the third sliding piece 1a 3, there is no difference in height because it is a single piece. A pressing force which is substantially equal to the total pressing force from the trolley wire 5 minus a force acting upon the third sliding piece 1a 3 will cause the difference in height between the first and second sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2. Accordingly, the pressing force causing the difference in height becomes a very slight force, and therefore the difference in height scarcely occurs in conjunction with the fact that the sliding plate pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are fixed to the continuous sliding plate fixing portion 2a and very closely adjacent to each other. According to the invention, moreover, particu lar elastic connecting members 7, springs 8, pins 9, shunts 10, and the like are not needed for supporting the sliding pieces 1a 1c as a unitary body, so that the divided sliding pieces can be made smaller in longitu dinal and transverse directions at will. Furthermore, the sliding plate support structure according to the invention does not increase the masses of other parts, so that mass of movement is very small to increase the followability of the pantograph. For example, in comparison of this embodi ment with the prior art using standard pantographs of the new Japanese superexpress railway Shinkansen , substantial mass of movement of these members can be reduced at least to 1 20 1 30 of that in the prior art, so that remarkably improved effect can be obtained. Fig. 9 illustrates another embodiment of the invention wherein like components have been designated by the same reference numerals as those in the previous embodiment. It is substantially similar to the previous embodiment with exception that the sliding pieces 1a , 1b and 1c are parallelogramic as viewed in Fig. 9 so that adjacent ends of the sliding pieces are oblique in moving directions of a vehicle so as to overlap with each other in the directions. With this arrangement, a trolley wire will moves progressively from one sliding piece to the other without any stepwise transistion, so that smoother sliding movement can be accomplished. As can be seen from the above explanation, according to the invention the mass of movement of the sliding plates on the pantograph moving following trolley wires is slight, so that the followability of the sliding plates to the wires is considerably improved, thereby preventing the groove shaped wearing at adjacent ends of sliding plates and vibration caused by difference in height of the plates. Accordingly, the sliding plate support structure according to the invention does not cause undesirable phenomena such as arc. Moreover, the sliding plate support structure with the leaf spring bodies according to the invention is reliable in operation, economical of manufacture and simple and easy to maintain, repair and replace. Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate a further embodiment of the invention, wherein like components have been designated by the same reference numerals as in the previous embodiments. Two bow members 4, connecting arms 6, sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c are substantially the same as those in Fig. 4, so that these members will not be described in further detail. Fig. 13a is a development view illustrating the leaf spring body 2. Fig. 13b illustrates a part of the leaf spring body including inverted Ω shaped loops. The leaf spring body 2 is provided on both sides with sliding plate fixing portions 2a for fixing a number of the adjoining sliding plate pieces 2a, 1b and 1c. Portions of each sliding plate fixing portion correspond ing to adjoining ends of the sliding pieces are formed into inverted Ω shaped loops. The leaf spring body 2 is further provided along its center with a mounting portion 2c having female screw members 2d fixed thereto by welding for fixing the leaf spring body 2 to the bow member 4 by means of bolts 11. The leaf spring body 2 having such a configuration is formed so as to cause support spring portions 2b to be semicircular as shown in Fig. 12 in substantially the same as in Fig. 6. In the same manner as in Fig. 7, the adjoining ends of the sliding plate pieces in the right and left rows are shifted so as not to be aligned with each other in running directions of a vehicle not shown as shown in Fig. 13a. In order to compensate for the shortening of the longitudinal dimension of the leaf spring body 2 due to the Ω shaped loops 2f, pairs of openings 2e each connected by slots 2e are formed in alignment with respective pairs. Instead of the inverted Ω shaped loops 2f, polygonal loops 2G including straight portions may be used such as square as shown in Fig. 14, which can achieve the aimed object in the same manner. As such inverted Ω shaped loops enable the leaf spring body to elongate an effective spring length ℓ Figs. 13b and 16 at will without spacing the sliding pieces 1a 1c, the leaf spring body can achieve its performance without losing its strength and rigidity having spring characteristic, even if adjacent sliding plate pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are greatly angularly positioned. Fig. 15 illustrates shapes of adjacent ends of sliding plate pieces wherein adjacent surfaces of the pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are inclined to form a triangular space P diverging toward an inverted Ω shaped loop 2f The sliding plate pieces are fixed to the leaf spring body 2 so as to force these pieces toward each other to give an initial force to the leaf spring body 2. In this manner, the adjacent sliding pieces are in line contact with each other with force F. Fig. 16 is an enlarged side view of the proximity of sliding plate pieces for explaining how to move these members when a wire 5 slides thereon in the sliding plate support structure of a current collector according to this embodiment. Assuming that a trolley wire 5 has arrived at an end of a first sliding plate piece 1a 1 adjacent to an end of a second sliding plate piece 1a 2, the pressing force of the wire 5 of course acts directly on the piece 1a 1 and indirectly on the piece 1a 2 through a sliding plate fixing portion 2a. At the same time, the force acts directly on a third sliding piece 1a 3 fixed to a sliding plate fixing portion 2a on opposite side to the above sliding plate fixing portion 2a. As adjacent ends of the sliding plate pieces on the side of the third sliding piece 1a 3 are shifted from the adjacent ends of the first and second sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2, the pressing force of the wire 5 acts on the third sliding piece 1a 3 substantially at its center at the movement shown in Fig. 8. As to the third sliding piece 1a 3, there is no difference in height because it is a single piece. A pressing force which is substantially equal to the total pressing force from the trolley wire 5 minus a force acting upon the third sliding piece 1a 3 will cause the difference in height between the first and second sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2. Accordingly, the pressing force causing the difference in height becomes a very slight force, and therefore the difference in height scarcely occurs in conjunction with the fact that the sliding plate pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are fixed to the continuous sliding plate fixing portion 2a and very closely adjacent to each other. However, above action between these members is considered in a steady condition. In actual case, particularly at high speeds, various external disturbing factors are added to the above steady condition to cause a condition as shown in Fig. 17a although it is seldom, if ever. If adjacent ends of sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 assume the positions shown in broken lines in Fig. 17a and at the moment a trolley wire arrives at the position shown in a broken line, the wire will be fitted in a space between the ends of the sliding pieces, so that smooth movement of the wire 5 in directions x is obstructed and therefore irregular wear at the edges and vibrations are caused. As shown in Fig. 17a, however, as the adjacent ends of the sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are forced toward each other by the action of the initial forces F and the end faces of these pieces are inclined, uppermost edges of the end faces are in line contact with each other without forming any space therebetween into which the trolley wire is fitted, so that the trolley wire moves smoothly in the directions x. Even if the adjacent ends of the sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 assume in positions shown in Fig. 17b where the adjacent ends are lowered, the sliding pieces are in line contact with each other to be rigidly connected by the initial forces F without any space on the side of the wire, so that the wire moves smoothly without the irregular wear and vibration. ln view of dynamics it is of course necessary to reduce the mass of movement of members subjected to the force of the trolley wire by separating the sliding piece from the adjacent sliding piece. In this case, as the sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are in line contact with each other, they act about the contact line as a rotating axis. In other words, when the sliding piece 1a 1 is subjected to the weight of the trolley wire 5, the sliding piece 1a 1 is depressed and the end of the sliding piece 1a 2 to which is attached a spring loop 2f is also depressed. Moreover, as the sliding piece 1a 2 is connected to a next sliding piece 1a 3 with a spring loop 2f , the sliding piece 1a 2 is tilted so as to raise its right hand end viewed in Fig. 17b, so that one half of the mass of the sliding piece 1a 2 is moved by the application of the electric wire 5. Moreover, the mid portion of the sliding piece is urged upwardly by a spring not shown , the right end of the sliding piece is raised viewed in Fig. 17b as the function of a lever. The sliding piece 1a 3 is scarcely moved because of the spring loop 2f deformed and absorbing transmitted force, so that the mass of the sliding piece 1a 1 subjected to the force of the trolley wire becomes under a condition separated from the other members. Although the three sliding pieces have been explained, it holds true in sliding pieces arranged on the left side of the sliding pieces 1a 1 or sliding pieces arranged in two rows. Figs. 18 21 illustrate another embodiment of the invention, wherein a plurality of adjacent sliding plate pieces 1a and 1b are arranged in a row on a bow member 4 in its longitudinal direction through a leaf spring body 2 and respective U shaped springs 8 in a resilient manner. Adjacent ends of the sliding plate pieces are formed on one end and the other end with projections and recesses so as to be fitted with each other with clearances when they are arranged in a row. In other words, the adjacent sliding plate pieces are fixed to the leaf spring body 2 which is elastic and electric conductive such as stainless steel, phosphor bronze, or the like so as to connect these sliding pieces by the leaf spring body 2. These leaf spring body 2 is resiliently supported by the conductive springs 8 corresponding to the sliding pieces on the bow member 4 to form a unitary body. In more detail, the two bow members only one member shown 4 are connected by connecting arms 6 to form a unitary body and mounted in a framework so as to press the sliding pieces on the bow members against trolley wires 5. The number of sliding plate pieces 1a and 1b are fixed to an elastic continuous stainless steel plate as by bolts. Although the stainless steel is used as the leaf spring body 2 in this embodiment, any other elastic material having stainless property and good electric conductivity may be used such as phosphor bronze. In this embodiment, the leaf spring body 2 is formed separately from an auxiliary sliding plate 3, but they may be integrally formed. Instead of the projections and recesses at the adjacent ends of the sliding plate pieces, wave shaped fitting may be used. Fig. 18a illustrates a particular embodiment having only one row of sliding plate pieces and Fig. 18b illustrates two rows of the sliding plate pieces. Thicknesses of the lapping portions of the sliding plate pieces will be explained with reference to Figs 22 and 23 illustrating lowered sliding plate pieces and raised sliding plate pieces by the force of a trolley wire. Lengths of the projections and the recesses of the sliding plate pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are such that proper guidance of the pieces is achieved without undue clearances between adjacent ends of the pieces when a trolley wire 5 moves in longitudinal directions of the bow member with the aid of zigzag arrangement of the wire even if both the adjacent ends of the pieces are lowered or raised. Moreover, upper and lower surfaces at ends of the sliding pieces are inclined and distal ends are circularly chamfered or rounded. These dimensions and shapes are so determined that the inclination of the lower surfaces at the ends of the sliding pieces corresponds to the maximum inclined angles of the sliding pieces so as to make minimum the bending stresses acting upon the leaf spring body, for example, when both the ends of the sliding pieces are lowered as shown in Fig. 22. If the lower surface at the end of the piece were not inclined, the lower edge of the end would be greatly lowered as at C to break the leaf spring body 2 adjacent thereto as shown in dot and dash lines in Fig. 22. The dimensions and shapes of the upper surfaces of the adjacent ends of the sliding plate pieces are so determined that when both the adjacent ends of the pieces are raised as shown in Fig. 23, the inclination of the upper surfaces corresponds to the maximum inclined angles of the sliding pieces so as not to cause steps or difference in height and clearances. If the upper surfaces at the ends of the pieces were not inclined, upper edges of the ends would slide each other to cause a step as at D which would obstruct the movement of the trolley wire 5 to cause the vibration and arc at the step. It is essential to determine the dimensions and configurations of the lapping portions of the sliding plate pieces so as to permit the trolley wire to move smoothly without causing steps, clearances and the like, even if both the adjacent ends of the pieces are lowered and raised when the wire 5 moves on the sliding pieces 1a and 1b in the longitudinal directions of the bow member. The sliding plate pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 having the lapping portions thus constructed are fixed to the leaf spring body 2 as by bolts so as to connect these pieces by means of the leaf spring body 2. The springs 8 corresponding to the respective sliding pieces are fixed to the leaf spring body 2 by means of the above bolts and are fixed to the bow member by means of further bolts. In this manner, the respective sliding plate pieces 1a and 1b can be moved independently and are resiliently supported on the bow member 4. The outermost sliding plate piece 1b has an obliquely diverging outer end. The leaf spring body 2 has also an obliquely diverging outer end corresponding to the sliding piece 1b. An auxiliary sliding plate 3 is fixed to the bow member 4 and has a trapezoidal end mating with the obliquely diverging outer end of the outermost sliding plate piece 1b in order to achieve smooth movement of trolley wires 5 on these members. In this case, the wire 5 scarcely slides on the auxiliary sliding plate 3 beyond the outermost sliding plate pieces 1b. Instead of the above construction, it is geometrically possible that the sliding plate pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are slightly spaced and hinged with each other by means of a pin below them. However, such a pin is likely to be worn off due to vibrations when moving. Moreover, as the maximum clearance between the sliding pieces is determined by inclined angles when adjacent ends of two sliding pieces are lowered, clearances and steps are caused to obstruct the movement of the wire 5 when the inclined angles are less than that corresponding to the maximum clearance. In contrast herewith the present invention achieves its object by a simple construction and very useful. With the arrangement of this embodiment, the movement of the sliding pieces when the trolley wire moves thereon will be explained hereinafter. Referring to Fig. 22, assuming that both the adjacet ends of the sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are lowered, when a trolley wire 5 has arrived at an end of the sliding plate piece 1a 1, the sliding surface of the sliding piece is subjected to pressing force, so that the sliding piece 1a 1 is obliquely depressed downwardly against the force of the spring 8. This oblique depression of the sliding piece is easily effected owing to the soft spring characteristics of the spring 8 with the aid of the pressing force from the wire being offset from the center of the leaf spring 8. The pressing force simultaneously acts on the adjacent end of the sliding plate piece 1a 2 because of the overlapping of two adjacent ends of the pieces. The sliding piece 1a 2 is also depressed without any step. Although the inclined angles of these pieces are changed, the overlapping portions of the sliding pieces serve to guide the trolley wires 5. In this case, the movement of the wire 5 is smoothly effected without any separation of the wire, arc and vibration with the aid of good conditions that the sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are connected by one leaf spring body 2 to facilitate the relative bending action of the pieces and the bending is effected in the same plane at a close position. In this case, sliding plate pieces correspond to the movement of the wire are limited to the sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a b in contact with the wire 5. Other sliding plate pieces only one pieces 1a 3 shown arranged outside of the sliding plates 1a 1 and 1a 2 are connected by the leaf spring body 2 in a very soft or flexible manner and independently subjected to urging force. These other sliding plate pieces are maintained in horizontal positions under no load condition. Accordingly, only the inertia masses of the inclined sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 are in charge of the dynamic movement. Such inertia masses are very small in comparison with those in the prior art whose bow member is moved together with members thereon. In other words, the following acceleration of the pantograph to the wires is increased corresponding to the decrease of the inertia masses if the pressing force is constant. Figs. 23 illustrates both the adjacent ends of the sliding pieces 1a 1 and 1a 2 being raised. This is assumed that when the sliding pieces are retained in vibration after a trolley wire passed, the wire again arrives at raised ends of the sliding pieces. As the ends of the sliding pieces are overlapping, there is no clearance at the raised ends. The ends are inclined corresponding to those when the adjacent ends are lowered. Accordingly, the trolley wire 5 smoothly slides on the sliding pieces without step as shown in dot and dash lines at D. In this manner, the current collector performs its function without arc and separa tion of wire. Figs. 24 29 illustrate a further embodiment of the invention. Two bow members 4 only one shown in the drawings are connected by connecting arms 6 to form a unitary body and mounted in a framework of a pantograph so as to urge sliding plates on upper surfaces of the bow members 4 against trolley wires 5 for an electric car by forces of springs. A great number of sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c are contiguously arranged in two rows on the bow member 4 in its longitudinal directions. Adjacent ends of the pieces in one row are shifted in the longitudinal direction with respect to adjacent ends of the pieces in the other row so as not to be aligned with each other in transverse directions. The sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c are fixed to a continuous elastic stainless steel plate as by welding. However, any other plate like elastic material may be used such as phosphor bronze or the like so long as it has spring action, stainless property and good electric conductivity. The above stainless steel plate is formed as a leaf spring body 2 as a unitary body detachably resiliently supported on the bow member at locations corresponding to the sliding plate pieces. Fig. 27 is a development view of the leaf spring body 2 which is provided at its center with sliding plate fixing portions 2a for fixing a number of the adjoining sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c in two rows on the leaf spring body 2. The leaf spring body 2 is further provided on both slides with mounting portions 2c having female screw members 2d fixed thereto by welding for fixing the leaf spring body 2 to the bow member 4 by means of bolts 11. The leaf spring body 2 is formed integrally with the sliding plate fixing portions 2a, the mounting potions 2c and support spring portions 2b connecting between the mounting portion 2c and the sliding plate fixing portions 2a at every sliding plate pieces. The leaf spring body 2 having such a configura tion is formed into opposed U shapes so as to cause the support spring portions 2b to be semicircular as shown in Fig. 26. As above described, the adjoining ends of the sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c in the right and left rows are shifted so as not to be aligned with each other in running directions of a vehicle. In order to separate masses of movement of sliding plate pieces abutting against a trolley wire and pieces linked with the abutting pieces, the leaf spring body 2 is formed between the sliding pieces with apertures 2f for preventing steps at adjacent ends of the pieces and formed in support spring portions 2b with openings 2e. In more detail, as shown in Fig. 27, the leaf spring body 2 is formed in its center with apertures 2f extending over substantial width of the center along oblique lines connecting adjacent ends of the sliding pieces in one row and the other row to form leaf spring portions 2G between the apertures 2f to connect two rows of the sliding pieces. Shapes and configurations of the leaf spring portion 2G are so determined that connecting spring characteristics relative to the respective sliding plate pieces 1a can be obtained in order to obtain smooth movement of trolley wire without steps at adjacent ends of the sliding pieces when the wire passes on the sliding pieces. Moreover, on outer sides of the sliding plate pieces 1a the openings 2e are formed to form the support spring portions 2b extending from centers of the pieces, so that the openings 2e on left side are aligned with the support spring portions 2b viewed in Fig. 27 in moving directions of a vehicle, and openings 2e on right side are aligned with the support spring portions 2b. The leaf spring body 2 supporting the sliding plate pieces 1a, 1b and 1c thereon in unison is resiliently mounted on the bow member 4 by means of bolts 11. The outermost sliding plate pieces 1b and 1c on both sides of the bow member have outer ends which are oblique relative to the running directions of the vehicle. The leaf spring body 2 has also oblique ends at ends of the sliding plate fixing portions 2a as shown in Fig. 27. An auxiliary sliding plate 3 is fixed to the bow member 4 and has a trapezoidal end mating with the oblique ends of the outermost sliding plate pieces 1b and 1c and overlapping the pieces 1b and 1c in the running directions of the vehicle. Parts of the overlapping portions of the sliding plate pieces 1b and 1c and the auxiliary sliding plate 3 are chamfered relative to a horizontal plane in order to achieve smooth movement of trolley wires 5 on these members. In this case, the wire 5 scarcely slides on the auxiliary sliding plate 3 beyond the outermost sliding plate pieces 1b and 1c. With this arrangement, the movement of these members when a wire 5 slides thereon will not be described in further detail since it is substantially the same as that explained by referring to Fig. 8. Figs 28 and 29 illustrate other embodiments of the invention where like components have been designated by the same reference numerals as used in the previous embodiments. The embodiment shown in Fig. 28 is substantially similar to that shown in Fig. 24 with exception that a leaf spring body is formed with apertures 2f extending along oblique lines connecting centers of the sliding pieces in two rows to form leaf spring portions 2G extending along oblique lines connecting adjacent ends of the sliding pieces in two rows. The embodiment shown in Fig. 29 is also substantially similar to that shown in Fig. 24 with exception that a leaf spring body is formed with elongated apertures 2f extending over substantial width of the center perpendicularly to a longitudinal direction of a bow member and starting at and aligned with adjacent ends of sliding pieces on both sides to form leaf spring portions 2G . As an alternative, instead of the apertures 2f, 2f and 2f , a plurality of apertures may be formed in symmetry in an intermediate portion of a leaf spring body 2. Any shapes of apertures may be formed so long as the leaf spring body 2 is a unitary body. With these arrangement, various moving charac teristics of sliding pieces abutting against electric wires and linking characteristics of adjacent sliding plate pieces can be obtained by last three embodiments in Fis. 24, 28 and 29. In addition to complicated actions of vehicles in various directions, there are various characteristics of trolley wires, so that the optimum conditions are not necessarily obtained only by considering characteristics of typical pantographs. Accordingly, these embodiments are useful because optimum characteristics can be selected from various characteristics. While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
