## Description
POLYESTER AMIDE IMIDE WIRE ENAMELS Polyester amide imide wire enamels which are used commercially are high molecular weight, high viscosity, difficultly soluble polymers requiring strong,.nox ious solvents in large quantities, not only for application to wire, but also for proper reaction in the kettle.One widely used commercial polyester amide imide wire enamel is made by blending four reaction products seeU.S. Patent 3,555,113 1 a polyester amide imide with high amideimide content which requires a high solvent content, specifically cresylic acid, in the reaction kettle to keep the reaction mixture mobile during critical periods of the reaction 2 a polyester 3 a polyurethane blocked isocyanate and 4 a low molecular weight phenolic resin.The final resin is dissolved to 25 to 30 solids in a cresylic acid aromatic hydrocarbon solvent mixture. The effluent from the stoving of this wire enamel is ecologically unacceptable and must be burned in an incinerator. U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,117,032 Kwiecinski , discloses a wire coating powder prepared by first formulating a solventless aromatic polyester amide imide.Excess polyol is used to replace the solvent. Accordingly, the present invention resides in a polyester amide imide wire enamel blend characterized in that said blend comprises A a solution in a carbitol.of a cross linkable polyester comprising the reaction product of i a polyol which is d niiLil e oi a and a triol 2 a polyfunctional carboxylic compound at least 80 by weight selected from the group consisting of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, alkyl esters of terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid up to C3, and mixtures thereof 3 a catalyst B a solution in a carbitol of a linear polyester comprising the reaction product of 1 a diol 2 a carboxylic compound at least 80 by weight selected from the group consisting of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, alkyl esters up to C3 of terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid, and mixtures thereof 3 a catalyst and a solution in a carbitol of a polyester amide imide component comprising the reaction product of 1 a polyester which comprises the reaction product of a a polyol which is a mixture of a diol and a triol b a polyfunctional carboxylic compound at least 80 by weight selected from terephthalic acid isophthalic acid, alkyl esters up to C3 of terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid, and mixtures thereof c a catalyst 2 a diamine and, 3 trimellitic anhydride and, said polyester amide imide wire enamel blend also containing a fatty acid component which may be reacted into any of its polyester components. We have found that a polyester amide imide wire enamel blend having excellent properties can be made at a very high solids concentration using an ecologically acceptable solvent. The solvents used in this invention are carbitols, which are high boiling and have been designated under Rule 66 as ecologically acceptable solvents.The resin is applied to wire in the conventional manner and its properties on wire match those of good class 150so to class 1800C conventional wire enamels. The following is a description of the ingredients used in practicing this invention. SOLVENT The solvent is a carbitol, that is, a diethyler e glycol monoalkyl ether or a diethylene glycol monoalkyl ether acetate where the alkyl group is C1 Lo 4 as esters are preferred because they react less into the polymer, and acetate esters are preferred because they are commercially available. Specifically, the preferred carbitols are diethylene glycol monoethyl ether commonly called carbitol , and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate commonly called carbitol acetate , because they are high boiling solvents and are ecologically acceptable.Other carbitols which can be used include diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monopropyl ether acetate, etc. POLYOL Diols which can be used in this invention include cyclohexanedimethanol, triethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, 1,4 butane diol, neopentyl glycol, propylene glycol, 1,5 pentanediol, etc. The preferred diols are triethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, 1,4 butane diol, and neopentyl glycol because they have been found to work well and are inexpensive. Triols which can be used in this invention include tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate THEIC , glycerol, trimethylol ethane, and trimethylol propane. The preferred triol is THEIC because it produces wire enamels having better thermal properties. FATTY ACID The fatty acid is a Cl2 to C18 monocarboxylic unsaturated acid. Fatty acids which can be used in this invention include soya, linseed, tung, etc. The preferred fatty acid is soya because it produces wire enamels having good thermal stability and it is relatively inexpensive. DIAMINE Suitable diamines include meta phenylene diamine, methylene dianiline, 2,6 diamino toluene, 2,4diamino toluene, etc. The preferred diamine is meta phenylene diamine because it produces enamels having greater thermal stability. In the preferred method of making the polyesteramide imide wire enamel blend of this invention, fourComponents are first separately prepared. These compo nents are a r jr linkable polyester, ci linens pOlyLttI a polyester amide imide, and a cresol formaldehyde resin. PREPARATION OF CROSS LINKABLE POLYESTER The cross linkable polyester is prepared by first mixing together a polyol, a polyfunctional carboxylic compound, a diethylene glycol monoalkyl ether acetate hereinafter called a carbitol acetate , and a catalyst.A fatty acid is preferably also included in the composi tion. The polyol is a mixture of a triol and diol in molar ratio of triol to diol of infinity to about 1 1.The preferred molar ratio of triol to diol is about 5 1 to about 15 1. The amount of polyol used in the composition should be the stoichiometric equivalent required to react with the carboxylic acid plus about 30 to about 60 equivalent percent in excess. The carboxylic compound must be at least 80 selected from the group consisting of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, or alkyl esters of terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid up to C3. The rest of the carboxylic compound used in the composition may be trimellitic acid, trimellitic anhydride, maleic anhydride, adipic acid, or another aliphatic carboxylic acid. Mixtures of various acids or their esters are also contemplated. The preferred acid is terephthalic acid because it is inexpensive. It is preferable to use the dimethyl esters of the acids as they react more easily. The amount of carbitol acetate in the composition should be about 5 to about 20 by weight, based on the total composition of cross linkable polyester. The catalyst is a condensation catalyst if the carboxylic compound has acid or anhydride groups and is ar ester interchange catalyst if the carboxylic compound is an ester. The ester interchange catalyst is preferably an organic titanate ester such as tetraisopropyl titanate or butyl titanate. Tetraisopropyl titanate is preferred.The condensation catalyst is preferably dibutyl tin oxide.Butyl stannoic acid can also be used, but dibutyl tin oxide is preferred. The amount of catalyst used should be about 0.5 to about 2 g. per mole of dicarboxylic acid. The fatty acid, which is preferably present in the cross linkable polyester, should be used in an amount equal to about 5 to about 10 mole percent of the amount of carboxylic compound. Once the composition is prepared, it is heated to form the cross linkable polyester. A suitable and preferred reaction schedule is to heat rapidly to 180 C, then to increase the temperature at a rate of 10 C per hour up to 2050C, then to increase the temperature at a rate of 150C per hour up to 2500C. A carbitol is then added to bring the solids content down to about 55 to about 75 solids. PREPARATION OF LINER POLYESTER The linear polyester is prepared from a diol, a dicarboxylic acid, and a catalyst. A fatty acid is also preferably present. The amount of diol used should be the stoichiometric equivalent needed to react with the carboxylic compound, plus about 30 to about 60 equivalent percent in excess. A mixture of diols is preferred to prevent crystallization. The catalysts were described in the discussion of the cross linkable polyester. The fatty acid which is preferably present should be used in an amount equal to about 3 to about 10 mole percent of the carboxylic compound. The composition is then heated to form the linear polyester. A preferred redaction schedule is to heat rapidly to 160 C and then increase the temperature at a rate of 15 C per hour up LO 260 C, and to hold it at that temperature for eight hours. The composition is then vut with carbitol to about 55 to about 75 solids. PREPARATION OF POLYESTER AMIDE IMIDE In making the polyester amide imide, it is preferable ro first prepare a polyester. This p er is made by reacting ct pyol , a tarbt,xylic compound nc i catalyst. A fatty acid is preferably also present. The polyol is a mixture of a diol and a triol in a molar ratio of about 1 3 to about 1 10. The preferred molar ratio is about 1 4 to about 1 5. The amount of polyol used should be equal to the stoichiometric equivalent needed to react with the dicarboxylic acid, plus about 80 to 100 equivalent percent in excess. The carboxylic compound was described in the discussion of the cross linkable polyester. A fatty acid is also preferably present. The amount of fatty acid should be about 5 to about 10 mole percent based on the carboxylic compound. The polyester is prepared by heating this composition, preferably by heating rapidly to 1800C then at a rate of 150C pr hour to 2200C to an acid number of less than 5. After the polyester is prepared, and while it is still hot, a diamine and trimellitic anhydride are added.The molar ratio of diamine to trimellitic anhydride should be about 1 1 to about 0.8 1. Sufficient diamine and trimellitic anhydride should be used so that the amide plus the imide groups in the polyester amide imide component are from 1 to about 2.5 times the number of ester groups.After the diamine and trimellitic anhydride have been added, the composition is heated to produce a clear fluid resin. This may advantageously be accomplished at about 190 C to about 2100C. At this point, it is preferable to add additional trimellitic anhydride to increase the total carboxyls in the reaction by about 3 to about 7 mole percent of the total carboxylic compound. It is also preferable to addTHEIC in an amount equal to about 5 to about 10 equivalent percent based on the total polyol. If additional trimellitic anhydride and THEIC are added, the reaction is continued until these ingredients are reacted in. This may be accomplished at about 2000C to about 2100C for about one half hour for each ingredient. The composition is then cut with carbitol to about 55 to about 75 solids. PREPARATION OF CRESOL FORMALDEHYDE RESIN The cresol formaldehyde resin is prepared by reacting a phenol with formaldehyde in the presence of a amine catalyst. Suitable phenols which can be used include meta para cresol, phenol, t butyl phenol, etc. The preferred phenol is meta para cresol. Formaldehyde is used as a mixture with water of 40 formaldehyde and 60 water. The molar ratio of phenol to actual formaldehyde present should be about 1.2 1 to about 1.6 1. Amine catalysts which can be used include various amines, such as triethanolamine, dimethylethanol amine, or benzyldimethylamine. The preferred amine catalyst is triethanolamine. The amount of catalyst should be about 5 to about 12 by weight based on the total weight of. the composition. The composition is then heated to form the cresol formaldehyde resin. The reaction is preferably carried on by refluxing for about an hour and one half at 1000C, decanting off the water, neutralizing the catalyst with salicylic acid, then heating to 40 to 800C under 26 mm of mercury pressure to about 36 poises viscosity. The composition is then cut with carbitol to about 40 to about 60 solids. PREPARATION OF POLYESTER AMIDE IMIDE BLEND The polyester amide imide wire enamel blend is prepared by mixing together about 30 to about 50 by weight based on total solids of the polyester amide imide portion, about 20 to about 30 of the linear polyester portion, about 10 to about 20 of the cross linkable polyester portion, and up to about 15 of the cresol formaldehyde resin portion. The blend also preferably contains about 2 to about 5 hexamethoxymethyl melamine to improve cut through, and about 2 to about 5 adhesion promoters such as organic titanates, for example, tetraisopropyl titanate or tetrabutyl titanate. The cresol formaldehyde resin portion is preferably present and a preferred amount is up to about 10 .The blend also preferably contains up to about 2 copper ethyl aceto acetate, cobalt napht ha nate, or manganese naphthanate at 6 cobalt or manganese to improve adhesion. The polyester amide imide wire enamel blend also preferably includes up to 20 by weight of an end blocked isocyanate to improve adhesion as tested for in the Emerson scrape test. A cyclic trimer of toluene diisocyanate end blocked with phenol or some other end blocked isocyanate may be used, but the preferred end blocked isocyanate is a THEIC terephthalate ester urethane isocyanate blocked with meta para cresol seeExample VI because it does not detract from flexibility as other isocyanates do. The polyester amide imide wire enamel blend con tains no water, no cresylic acid, and no other solvent except for the carbitol. Although water is present with the formaldehyde, it is boiled off before the blend is completed. Mixtures of various components and ingredients are also contemplated. The blend is preferably prepared by mixing at about 80 to about 900C. It is then filtered to remove any solid matter. The polyester amide imide wire enamel blend can also be prepared by preparing the cross linkable polyester, the linear polyester and the polyester amide imide component together in sequence in the same reaction vessel. See Examples 1 and 8 . Another alternative is to include all the fatty acids in one of the polyester components instead of dividing it between the three different polyesters. The blend can then be coated onto wire and cured. A suitable cure procedure is to run the wire at a rate of 22 to about 28 feet per minute through a 12 ft. high tower at 4500C. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples EXAMPLE 1 The following reactants are charged into a 3liter, 4 neck reaction flask equipped with a heater, motor stirrer, nitrogen sparge tube, thermometer, and steam condenser 380.0 g ethylene glycol 6.12 M 61.2 g triethylene glycol 0.402 M 116.4 g soya fatty acid 0.414 M 232.0 g trimellitic anhydride 1.206 M The mixture is stirred and heated at lO0C per hour from 1800C to 2000C to a clear solution to make a polyester having excess hydroxyl groups.

The cut through temperature at 22 ft min is 3100C and the Emerson scrape is 12 to 14 lb.The thermal life data 12 hours at 2750C, 156 hours at 2500C, 528 hours at 2250C and 1350 hours at 2000C extrapolates to 1650C for a 20,000 hour life. EXAMPLE 5 The reactions and blend are exactly the same as those of Example 2 except that in Part I of Example 2 the 335.6 g of meta phenylenediamine is replaced by 304.0 g of 2,4 diamino toluene and 76.0 g of 2,6 diamino toluene.The resulting blend is coated on 18 AWG copper wire at 22 to 28 ft min and is smooth with good flexibility 20 to 30 elongation 1X mandrel , 175 to 2250C 1X heat shock, 3100C cut through, and 14 to 16 lb. Emerson scrape. EXAMPLE 6 This blend is the same as that of Example 3 except that it includes an end blocked ester urethaneisocyanate prepared in the following manner with the following ingredients added to a 3 liter flask 522.0 g tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate 166.0 g terephthalic acid 11.0 g distilled water 2.5 g dibutyl tin oxide With nitrogen sparging and a downward water con denser to condense out the water of reaction, the mixture is heated at 2100C to 2600C at 150C hour until 44.5 g wit er is cursdtnsed out whence 552 g arbitol acetate is added and the solution is cooled.In a separate container, 690 g of a mixture containing 80 , 2,4 toluene diisocyanate and 20 2,6 toluene diisocyanate is added slowly to 531 g carbitol and reacted 1 2 hour at 1000C whence 360 g of carbitol acetate is added. This product is cooled and added to the 3 liter reaction flask and reacted 1 hour at 100 to 1050C. The yield is 2775 g of solution at 50 non volatiles. A blend is prepared the same as that of Example 3 except that 168 g of the above prepared solution is added. When coated on 18 AWG copper wire, the same properties as those of Example 3 are obtained except that the wire is smoother and slightly higher Emerson scape 32 lb is obtained. EXAMPLE 7 In this example, the ester amide imide portion does not contain a fatty acid. Fairly smooth coatings with good properties are obtained. The ester amide imide composition is as follows 106.0 g ethylene glycol 67.6 g triethylene glycol 10.6 g distilled water 2.35 g dibutyl tin oxide 131.5 g terephthalic acid The ester portion is reacted 1800C to 2200C to a clear solution and the amide imide portion is charged 57.0 g carbitol acetate solvent 167.8 g meta phenylenediamine 298.0 g trimellitic anhydride The reaction is continued at 190 to 2100C through the semi solid to a clear state where 43.2 g trimellitic anhydride is added and the reaction continued 1 2 hour at 190 to 2000C.Then 115.7 g tris 2 hydroxyethyi isocyanurate is added and the reaction is continued tln additional 3, hours at 205 to 2100C, whence 285 g carbi lol is added ind the solution is cooled. A yield of 1148 g of slut ion al. 70 l. non volatile is obtained. The hollowing blend is prepared completely free of the.non desirable cresylic acid solvent 186.5 g polyester alnide imide of this example 75.2 g Part II of Example 2 111.2 g Part III of Example 2 56.0 g tetraethylene glycol diacrylate 40.7 g Part II of Example 4 11.2 g tetraisopropyl titanate in 11.2 g carbitol This blend coats fairly smoothly on 18 AWG copper wire at 22 ft min to 32 ft min coating speed. The flexibility is 25 to 30tXÓ elongation plus 1X mandrel, the 1X heat shock passes at 2000C to 2250C, the cut through temperature is 3320C at 22 ft min bake, and the Emerson scrap e is 13 to 16 lb. EXAMPLE 8 This example has fair heat shock and good cutthrough with fair flexibility and coating smoothness.This resin contains about 1 by weight of cresylic acid. The following ingredients are charged into a reaction flask to prepare a polyester amide imide 187.2 g trimellitic anhydride 87.2 g meta phenylene diamine 33.6 g triethylene glycol 112.3 g ethylene glycol 59.1 g tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate 1.2 g tetraisopropyl titanate 2.0 g carbitol With nitrogen sparge and air cooled condenser, the ingredients are heated forming a turbid semi solid state which breaks up at about 18500. The reaction is continued at 19000 until clarity is achieved and then cooled to 1700C. At this point, 83.6 g meta phenylene diamine and 172.8 g trimellitic anhydride are added.Again while being heated a semi solid state forms. The reaction is continued to 19800 where a clear solution is obtained. The reaction is then cooled to 1700C where 3nol her 108 g trimellitic anhydride addition is made. The reaction is taken 170 C to 190 C at the rale of IO per hour. At this point 44.6 g maleic anhydride is added and reacted to clarity in 15 min. at which point 84 g of tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate is added. The reaction is continued for 1 2 hour at 1850 to 190 C. The reaction is stopped at this point by adding 200 g of carbitol acetate and 300 g of carbitol. The yield is 1308 g at 62 non volatile material. A blend is then prepared of the following previously prepared solution 170.0 g of polyester amide imide of this example 112.8 g of Part I, Example 3 30.3 g of Part IV, Example 2 The blend is then coated on 18 AWG copper wire in a 15 ft. vertical tower at speeds of . 22 to 28 ft min utilizing only four passes. The build is 2.4 to 2.7 mil with good flexibility of 20 1X mandrel, a 1X heat shock of 200 C and cut through of 3770C. The film is fairly smooth and has an Emerson scrape of 10 to 12 lb.
