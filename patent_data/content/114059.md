# Method of preparing a polyamide acid composition for preparing polyimide.

## Abstract
A polyamide acid composition for preparing a polyimide which is improved in the stability in a form of solution and can extend the pot life of the composition comprising a solution of a polyamide acid in an organic solvent, the polyamide acid being a precursor of the polyimide, and an N substituted heterocyclic compound as a chemical treating agent which can lower a rate of conversion of the polyamide acid to the poly imide. The pot life can be extremely extended to give the com position an enough flowability for a long time without reducing the excellent properties such as a heat resistance of the ob tained polyimide.
