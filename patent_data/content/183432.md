# Thermal sleeve for gun barrels.

## Abstract
A thermal sleeve for a gun barrel is in the form of a cylinder of a substantially rigid thermally insulating material 2,4,6 with a series of longitudinally and circumferentially spaced spacer members 20 disposed on the inner face of the cylinder. The spacer members 20 engage with the gun barrel and define an annular gap between the cylinder and the barrel. The sleeve 18 further includes means 28 for sealing the annular gap as well as means 32 for securing the cylinder on the barrel to ensure pressurised contact of the spacer members 20 with the barrel.
