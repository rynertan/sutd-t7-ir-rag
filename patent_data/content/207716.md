# A bearing assembly for journaling a shaft, such as a crankshaft of an i.c. engine.

## Abstract
A bearing assembly 20 including a saddle member 22 and a bearing cap 35 , each including a bearing receiving recess 24, 39 . The saddle member recess 24 is flanked by alignment slots 28a 28b . The bearing cap recess 39 is flanked by rectangular mounting shoulders 41a 41b which are asymmetrical in shape with respect to the axis of the recess 39 , and which are insertable within the slots 28a 28b . Dissymmetry between the shoulders 41a 41b pro hibits the first shoulder 41a from being inserted into the second slot 28b in a manner to cause proper alignment of the recesses 24 39 . Each shoulder 41a 41b has a vertical locating surface 43a 43b engageable with a guide surface 30a, 30b at the outer extremity of the respective slot 28a 28b , to precisely align the abutting edges of both recesses 24 39 when the shoulders 41a 41b are inserted into the slots 28a 28b . Only one of the two mounting bolts 53b need have a precision machined shank 55b in view of the locating surfaces 43a 43b and guide surfaces 30a 30b on the bearing cap 35 and saddle member 22 .
