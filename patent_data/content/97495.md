# Polymers of unsaturated acids.

## Abstract
Water soluble polymers from acrylic acid optionally with other monomers have a narrow molecular weight distribu tion and are made by continuous loop polymerisation particular in the presence of sodium chlorate and sodium metabisulphite as redox initiator. The loop polymerisation gives more uniform product than batch operation and the narrow molecular weight distribution gives polyacrylates useful in water treatment, scale inhibition and as disper sants.

## Description
This invention related to polymers of unsaturated acids and salts thereof and methods of making them. Polyacrylic acids and their alkali metal salts are known for use in aqueous solution for water treatment to stop deposition of solids and as dispersants and deflocculants to produce stable suspensions in e.g. minerals processing. They may also be used for sequestering metal ions such as calcium and magnesium in circumstances when polyphosphates cannot be used they may also be anti redeposition agents in detergents. For optimum properties with each use a close control on the molecular weight of the polymer is desired. The polyacrylates may be made by polymerizing acrylic acid in water in the presence of a catalyst, which is a free radical catalyst, often in combinations with a chain terminator.The polymerization of acrylic acid in the presence of water, ammonium persulphate and 2 mercapto ethanol or thioglycollic acid is described in USP 3787488 3904522 or 3665035 3756257 respectively.In the Examples the acrylic acid persulphate and particular thiol compound were each added in one or more separate portions to a well stirred aqueous solution. One problem with the above process is that the properties of the polymer obtained often vary significantly fran batch to batch, because the properties depend critically on the detailed conditions of the polymerization e.g. efficiency of mixing and reaction temperature and for many uses the properties of the polymer are critical. In addition the process has been found to give uneconomic conversions of monomer to polymer, so the monomer content of the product solution is often unacceptably high. Furthermore commercially a high concentration of polymer is wanted and, because of severe and fast heat evolution, the process must be performed In very many stages of addition of all the reagents and with the high risk of undesirable branching of the polymer claims. We have found a process for making a more uniform polymer product in a more controlled manner. The present invention provides a process for preparing a water soluble polymer wherein, in a continuous process, a monomer component, which comprises at least 70 molar X of acrylic acid and optionally up to 30 molar Z of a copolymerizable monomer, a free radical initiator and a free radical chain terminator are mixed with a recycled aqueous mixture comprising a water soluble polymer of said monomer component, and are reacted therein to form an aqueous reaction mixture, and a product portion of said reaction mixture is removed as a solution of water soluble polymer product leaving a remaining portion and said remaining portion is recycled as said recycled aqueous mixture for mixing again with said monomer component initiator and terminator, said aqueous reaction mixture and or said remaining portion being cooled.The said product portion maybe subsequently aged if needed to complete the polymerization, preferably by holding it at elevated temperature without addition of further initiator. The present invention also provides a water soluble polymer having repeating units derived from said monomer component, said polymer being such that when in the form of an aqueous solution at pH 7.2 of 42 concentration of the sodium salt of the polymer then said salt usually has a weight average molecular weight Mw, and number average molecular weight Mn, which are related according to the function Mw Mn a Mw b , where a is less than 7x10 5, and b is 11.8. The present invention also provides an aqueous medium, usually a solution which comprises at least 30 particularly at least 4AX by weight of said polymer or an at least partly neutralised salt thereof.The invention also provides salts of said polymers particular sodium, potassium and ammonium salts, in aqueous solution of the above concentration. The main monomer component is acrylic acid, which may be substantially water free e.g. glacial acrylic acid or may be added as aqueous acrylic acid of at least 60X acrylic content. Preferably the acrylic acid is substantially the only polymerizable monomer, but there may be up to 30 molar X e.g. 1 30 or 10 30T or 1 20 based on the total moles of monomer component of another copolymerizable monomer. Said monomer forms a water soluble polymer with said 70 or more of acrylic acid said monomer is usually miscible with acrylic acid and often with water and is generally a liquid, though solids which dissolve In acrylic acid or water may be used.The amount of the copolymerizable monomer is such that the mixture of monomer component and recycled aqueous mixture is a solution at the reaction temperature, and that the aqeuous reaction mixture produced is also solution at the reaction temperature. Examples of such copolymerizable monomers are ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids of 4 8 carbon atoms with 1 or 2 carboxylic acid groups e.g.methacrylic crotonic, fumaric and maleic acids, maleic anhydride, amides of such acids, such as methacrylamide and acrylamide and dialkyl aminoalkylene amides thereof e.g. ones with 1 3 carbon atoms in each alkyl or alkylene group such as dimethyl amino propyl or ethyl acrylamide, and esters of said acids with alkanols of 1 4 carbon atoms e.g. methanol or ethanol, such as methyl methacrylate or methyl acrylate, or with alkane diols e.g. of 2 4 carbon atoms, such as 2 hydroxyethyl and 2 or 3 hydroxy propyl acrylate and methacrylate esters of said acids with alkanols of 1 24 carbon aoms in molar amounts of up to 10 may be used. Examples of monomer components are mixtures of 70 90 molar acrylic acid and 10 30S molar methyl acrylate.The monomer component may contain small amounts of polymerization inhibitors as stabilizers e.g. 50 500ppm hydroquinone or its methyl ether.The free radical initiator may be any one known per se for free radical polymerizations of olefinic monomers such initiators are described for example in Emulsion Polymerizations by D. C.Blackley Applied Science Publishers London 1975, pages 155 245.Examples are peroxy compounds e.g. per sulphate also called peroxy disulphate salts, such as ammonium and alkali metal e.g. sodium persulphates, hydrogen peroxide, acyl peroxides e.g. of 2 16 carbon atoms such as benzoyl peroxide and acetyl peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides e.g. of 2 10 carbon atoms such as tert. butyl hydroperoxide aralkyl hydroperoxides e.g. of 7 13 carbon atoms such as bentyl hydroperoxide or dialkyl peroxides e.g. of 4 to 20 carbon atoms such as di tert. butyl peroxide, di aralkyl peroxide e.g. of 14 to 26 carbon atoms such as di benzyl peroxide, chlorate salts such as sodium chlorate, permanganate salts such as potassium permanganate. Other suitable compounds are azo initiators. The chain terminator is a compound capable of modifying transferring or terminating free radical chains. Such compounds are known per se for this purpose with olefinic monomers and are described for example in the Blackley text book referred to above pages 329 379. Preferred are thiol compounds e.g. with 1 or 2 thiol groups such as alkyl thiols of 1 8 carbon atoms, optionally with at least one hydroxyl and or amino and or carboxylic acid group, such as hydroxy alkane thiols or amino alkane thiols with 1 3 hydroxyl or amino group, 1 or 2 thiol group and 2 4 carbon atoms and no OH and or NH2 and or SH groups attached to the same carbon atoms, such as 2 mercaptoethanol, 2 mercaptoethyl amine or thioglycerol, or mercapto alkane carboxylic acids of 1 6 carbon atoms with 1 or 2 carboxylic acid groups and 1 or 2 thiol groups attached to different carbon atoms, such as thioglycollic and 2 or 3 mercaptoproplonic acid and thiomalic acid. The initiator and terminator are usually soluble in acrylic acid and or water they are, if possible, added in aqueous solution. Any comonomer is preferably dissolved In the acrylic acid for addition to the loop reactor. Advantageously the initiator is used with a reducing agent to form a redox system, also as described in Blackley thus peroxides may be used in conjunction with small amounts of transition metals such as iron, and chlorates or peroxydlsulphates are preferably used with bisulphites such as sodium metabisulphite. The most preferred initiator is the redox combination of a water soluble chlorate salt and a water soluble sulphur oxy compound derived from sulphurous acid, especially sodium chlorate and sodium metabisulphite. Molar proportions of chlorate to metabisulphite of 0.5 3.0 1 e.g. 0.9 to 2.5 1 are preferred. While metabisulphites are preferred, an equivalent amount of other sulphur oxy species derived from sulphurous acId may be used.These species are usually an ionic species from sulphurous acid or its anhydride or a precursor therefor.Thus sulphurous acid itself or gaseous sulphur dioxide may be added as such, but preferably water soluble salts thereof are used, e.g.ammonium or alkali metal such as potassium or sodium salts. The salts may be sulphites or bisulphites or hydrogen sulphites or the anhydrides thereof namely metabisuiphltes e.g. Na2 S205 which form bisuiphite in solution. Precursors of the bisulphites such as dithionites, which also form bisulphite In solution may be used.Hereafter in this specification, reference will be made to metabisulphites, but this is only for purposes of exemplication. Furthermore it is to be understood in this specification including the claims that, while reference is made to metabisulphites and molar ratios relating hereto, the species in the polymerization medium and in the solution of metabisulphite is probably the corresponding bisulphite, one mole of metabisulphite forming 2 moles of bisulphite, and hence where reference is made hereto to metabisulphltes, bisulphites themselves or sulphites, sulphurous acid or sulphur dioxide or dithionites should also be understood in double the given molar amounts. Preferably the initiator and terminator are In particular combinations e.g. one of thiol containing compounds with peroxy compounds such as persulphates, or the chlorate bisulphite combination. The molar proportion of terminator to monomer usually governs the absolute size of , and the spread of molecular weights i.e.Mw Mn, a higher proportion giving lower molecular weight compounds and a narrower spread i.e. lower Mw Mn and a lower proportion giving higher molecular weight compounds and a wider spread. Usually an amount of 0.1 20 such as 0.5 20 mole X e.g. 1 20 such as 1 15X e.g. 0.5 4 , or 4 12X such as 4 8x or 8 15S mole X of terminator or thiol group therein to monomer is used thus with mercaptoethanol or thioglycollic acid a weight X of 1 20X e.g. 4 12 or 10 15X based on the weight of acrylic acid as the sole monomer may be used. The proportion of initiator to monomer also normally governs the absolute size of Mw and the spread of molecular weights, again a higher proportion giving lower molecular weights and a narrower spread. But the proportion of initiator to monomer also governs the rate at which monomer is consumed and hence the degree to which monomer has been consumed in the polymerization by the average time the product portion is removed i.e. the residence time. For residence times of 2 40 mins, the percentage of the total number of moles of initiator or initiators to moles monomer is usually 0.1 5X e.g. 0.5 2.5X, or 1 2 particularly for persulphates and the chlorate metabisulphite combination. But it has been found that with molar proportions of chlorate to metabisulphite of greater than 1 1 e.g. 2 100 1 such as 3 2C 1 or 4 10 1, it is possible to reduce significantly the rate of evolution of heat produced during the polymerization operation thereby enabling it to be controlled more easily and or enabling the throughput of the loop to be increased. Use of these low proportions of metabisulphite to chlorate often gives rise to very low proportions of unreacted monomer in the polymeric product portion. Surprisingly, even with a reduced total concentration of chlorate bisulphite which would normally tend to increase the polymer molecular weight and spread of molecular weights , the molecular weight of the polymer and spread of molecular weights can be maintained, the size and spread depending on the amount of chain transfer agent.The total molar percentage of chlorate and metabisulphite based on the number of moles of monomer component is preferably up to 5X e.g. 0.5 4X such as 1.5 3.5X with a molar percentage of chlorate based on the number of moles of monomer component of up to 4X e.g. 0.3 3.5 such as 1 3.0 . The chlorate and metabisulphite or bisulphite salts may each be ammonium, sodium or potassium salts or mixtures thereof.Still higher molar percentages of chlorate in association with low proportions of chlorate to metabisulphite e.g. 0.5 2 1 and very low free monomer concentrations tend to give hazy, smelly polymeric product portions, which can usually be avoided by use of lower total initiator concentration and a higher proportion of chlorate to metabisulphite e.g. 7 1 associated with an increase in the free monomer concentration. The monomer component, initiator and terminator are mixed with an aqueous recycled mixture comprising a water soluble polymer of said monomer component, prepared earlier. The mixture usually contains at least 35 e.g. 35 65X by weight of said polymer, and preferably at least 40 such as 40 55 by weight of polymer. The mixture usually contains up to 5 by weight unreacted monomer component e.g. 0.005 5 such as 0.1 5 e.g. 0.5 2 or 0.005 0.7 of said component and may contain up to 10ppm iron, e.g. up to Sppm.The solvent for the polymer is usually substantially only water, but may contain up to 20 by weight of a water miscible organic solvent such as acetone, methanol ethanol, isopropanol or methylated spirits or a lower glycol or polyol of 2 6 carbon atoms e.g. ethylene glycol or glycerol, or an hydroxy ethylenated alkanol or glycol e.g.diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol mono methyl or ethyl ether.Lower alcohols, such as isopropanol also act as chain transfer agents, though usually in amounts of 20 80 mole X based on the number of moles of monomer component .The polymerization is usually performed at pH 0.5 4.0 e.g. 1 2.5. The monomer component, initiator and terminator may be mixed in any convenient way with the aqueous recycled mixture. Thus each, usually in aqueous solution, may be added separately and sequentially with the terminator added before the initiator, while the monomer may be added in any order relative to the initiator and terminator with sequential addition the initiator is preferably last and the monomer first. All three reagents are best added to the mixture simultaneously e.g. into the loop at the same place or preferably in a multi feed mixer. For uniform consistent operation uniform feeding of reagents is desirable e.g. continuous feeding at a constant rate or in phase pulsed feeding at a constant ratio of ingredients. If desired extra water or other solvent for the polymerixation may be added to the loop e.g. via the multi feed mixer. The polymerization is very exothermic and the heat produced is removed by cooling e.g. in a heat exchanger. The cooling may be before, and or after the separation of the product portion and remaining portion. In this separation the majority of the reaction mixture comprising polymer Is recycled for mixing with fresh monomer, initiator and terminator, while a minority is removed as the product portion of the desired polymer product. The recycle ratio of remaining portion to product portion is at least 50 1 e.g. 50 1 to 5000 1 such as at least 100 1 e.g. 150 1 to 4000 1. The polymerization may be carried out in a loop apparatus comprising at least one inlet for the feed components, i.e. monomer initiator and terminator and any reducing agent, a pump, a mixer which may be omitted if the pump can also act as a mixer , a heat exchanger as cooler and outlet for the product portion, the inlet, pump, heat exchanger and outlet being joined together by a pipe to form a loop. Preferably the inlet for the initiator is the last inlet before the mixer in the direction of flow of the aqueous mixture, or is part of or integral with the mixer. Advantageously the loop apparatus comprises a loop pipe having in order of the direction of flow of liquid a separate inlets for monomer component, terminator and one or more initiators, b the mixer, c the pump d the heat exchanger e the outlet, the inlets being upstream of or integral with said mixer.Preferably all the feed components have their inlets into the same mixer in the loop. The mixer may be upstream or downstream of the pump which creates turbulence in the liquid passing through it. Examples of types of mixer are centrifugal mixers, static in line mixers, pin disc mixers, orifice plate mixers or alternatively a mixer according toBritish Patent 1563995 may be used. Examples of types of pump are centrifugal pumps, gear pumps and lobe pumps. Preferably the pump is the mixer, e.g. a centrifugal pump with feed of the reagents into the pump inlet. Examples of types of heat exchanger are simple and multiple surface exchangers and coil exchangers, preferably of the thin film type as in plate heat exchangers. The exit line from the loop reactor may be controlled to keep the loop under less than atmospheric, substantially atmosphoric or more than atmospheric pressure e.g. up to 3kg cm2, as far as externally applied vacuum or pressure to the loop is concerned.Preferably, with an exit line at the highest point of the loop reactor, there is substantially no externally applied pressure or vacuum, i.e. the product portion overflows out of the exit line. The average residence time in the loop is 1 min to 60 min e.g.2 40 minutes and increasing the residence time usually increases the degree of conversion. The average reaction temperature is 40 140 usually 50 1000C or 75 1100C such as 90 1050C, usually with less than 100C e.g. less than 5 C between the temperature of the liquid anywhere in the loop pressure is applied to the loop reactor as necessary at the higher temperatures to keep the polymerization medium liquid. The average residence time and the circulation rate and nature and amount of monomer component, initiator and terminator are usually chosen so that at least 90 e.g. at least 95 or 98X of the polymerization occurs within the average residence time as this usually results in the narrowest molecular weight distributions. The product portion removed from the loop comprises an aqueous solution of the polymer, and usually unreacted monomer, with an analysis the same as that of the recycled mixture. However often the polymerization is not quite complete at the time of removal of the product portion and in this case a further ageing period of 0.01 5 hrs. such as 0.5 2 hrs. or 2 60 mins. e.g. 15 45 mins at 501100C e.g. 75 1100C may be adopted, advantageously without addition of further initiator, though, in order to reduce the concentration of residual oxidant, e.g. sodium chlorate, the reductant part of a redox initiator e.g. sodium metabisulphite may be added after or during or instead of the aging. Reduced residual oxidant is often desirable when the polyacrylate product is used in association with oxidizable compounds In water treatment. The product polymer, a homo or copolymer of acrylic acid may be isolated e.g. by precipItation with an organic solvent but is usually sold as such in aqueous solution, or after concentration to at least 50S concentration if desired, though this is often not necessary. The aqueous polymer mixture which may otherwise be at pH2 4 may be treated by addition thereto of base e.g. ammonia or an alkali metal e.g. sodium hydroxide or carbonate or an alkanolamine such as aqueous sodium hydroxide to form at least partly neutralised derivative of the polymer e.g. in the form of an aqueous solution of a salt of the polymer e.g. one containing 35 65X or 35 55X e.g. 40 555 by weight of said salt, at a pH of 6 8 or higher, preferably 6.5 7.2. Thus 5 20X or 70 9OX of the acid groups in the polymer acid may be neutralised. Preferably at a time before neutralization with the base, a thiol free complexing agent for iron such as a water soluble di, tri or tetra carboxylic acid or salt e.g. a sodium salt thereof, usually an aliphatic one with 2 10 carbon atoms and an amino, amino or nitrilo or hydroxyl substituent or substituents such as ethylene diamine tetracetic acid gluconic acid or nitrilo acetic acid is present in the solution in amount up to 500 ppm e.g. 10 100 ppm the complexing agent may be added with the base or between adding base and exit from the loop or into the loop e.g. with any or every feed into the loop. Advantageously in the process of the invention, in a continuous process aqueous sodium chlorate and sodium metabisulphite in molar amounts, whose sum is 0.5 4 relative to the molar amount of monomer and whose ratio is 3 10 1, and acrylic acid and mercaptoethanol are continuously passed into a recycled aqueous mixture comprising 35 65Z recycled polyacrylic acid and reaction is performed at 80 1000C to form an aqueous reaction mixture, of which a product portion comprising polyacrylic polymer is removed, and the remaining portion recycled, the product portion being subsequently treated with further sodium metabisulphite and then at least partly neutralised. The polymer of the invention is a water soluble homo polymer of acrylic acid, or copolymer of acrylic acid and up to 30 mole X of a copolymerizable monomer based on the total molar amount of acrylic acid and copolymerizable monomer . The polymer may have free carboxyl groups or at least some of them such as substantially all of them may be in the form of carboxylate groups, with associated ammonium, alkali metal or alkanolamine of 2 8 carbons such as mono, dl and tri ethanolamine cations, so that the polymer is soluble in water at 40X concentration at pH6 8. The polymer Is preferably in the form of its sodium salt.The sodium salt form of the polymer at pH 7.2 In 42 aqueous concentration usually has a weight average molecular weightMw, and number average molecular weight Mn, which are related according to the function Mw Mn a Mw b, where a is less than 7x10 5, and b is 1 1.8. Usually 105a is 0.1 7, e.g. 0.5 4.5 and especially 1 3, while b is 1 1.8 e.g. 1.2 1.7 and especially 1.4 1.7. Mw is usually less than 100,000 and usually up to 60,000, and while it may be from 30,000 to 60,000 it is preferably less than 30,000 e.g. less than 25,000 such as 1000 30,000 or 1000 25000, e.g. 1000 4000 for water treatment uses 4000 10,000 for suspending minerals and 10,000 18,000 for pumpable slurries. All weight average, number average and third order molecular weights in this specification are values obtained by gel permeation chromatography by comparison with dextran standards obtained from Pharmacia, Upsala, Sweden and monomeric pure chemicals.For polymers with Mw below 25,000, the value of Mw divided by Mn is usually less than 2.3, e.g. less than 2.2 such as 1.3 2.2 or 1.3 2.0 and usually 1.5 1.8 or 1.6 1.9. particularly for products of Mw of 2000 11000 especially 2000 7000. For polymers with Mw of 25,000 to 60,000 the value of Mw Mn is usually 2 3.5. For polymers ofMw up to 20,000, the value of Mz the third order molecular weight to Mw is often less than 2.0 e.g. less than 1.9 such as 1.3 2.0 or 1.5 1.9. Polymers with a particularly preferred combinations have Mw Mn of 1.6 1.9 and Mz Mw of 1.5 1.9. Advantageously the sum of Mw Mn and Mz Mw is 2.6 4.0 in particular 3 3.9 and especially 3.4 3.9 or 3.4 3.8, all particularly for polymers with Mw below 25,000. The polymers may also be characterised by their viscosity average molecular weights Mv , which are absolute figures and do not need to be related by comparison with standards. Mv is obtained from the kinematic viscosities of aqueous solutions of sodium salts of the polymer of various known concentrations from the kinematic viscosity, the specific viscosity, viscosity number, intrinsic viscosity were obtained and, hence Mv by use of the Mark Houwink equatfon. Values of Mv for the polymers of the invention are usually 300 50,0 X e.g.300 20,000 such as 300 4000 values of 300 1000 for Mv for water treatment uses and 1000 4000 for Mv for mineral processing uses are preferred. The lower molecular weight polymers are particularly useful in water treatment for boflers, cooling water, desalinatfon plants and oil well flooding where they act as inhibitors of the deposition of insoluble inorganic solids e.g. scale and or sea water solids amounts of polymer of 5 500 e.g. 10 60ppm may be used, preferably mixed with aceto diphosphonic acid in a 3 1 ratio. The medium molecular weight polymers 4000 10,000 Mw may be used in the refining of minerals e.g. China Clay, in which refining they act as dfspersants or deflocculants amounts of 0.001 2 e.g 0.002 1X of polymer based on dry mineral weight may be used.The higher molecular weight polymers Mw 10,000 18,000 may be used tn the dispersion of fillers, pigments and minerals in aqueous systems to yield slurries of high solids contents, these slurries being stable and capable of being pumped amounts of 500 18000 ppm polymer based on total slurry may be used. All the polymers, including those of the highest molecular weight can be used fn the refinfng of talc using procedures as described In our UK PatentNo. 2019822 and with amounts of 0.1 2X e.g. 0.2 i polymer based on dry talc and use in detergents as antf redeposition agents and or sequestering agents for calcium and magnesium. The invention may be performed in an apparatus as illustrated in the accompanying drawing in which a line 1 is a loop line joining mixer 2, a pump 3, a heat exchanger 4 and an outlet 5 into a loop.Into mixer 2 are three feed lines 6, 7 and 8 for monomer, initiator and terminator respectively. The pump 3 and mixer 2 may be the same piece of apparatus combining both functions e.g. a centrifugal pump.A vent 9 is present at the uppermost part of the outlet 5, but may be in the uppermost part the loop preferably near outlet 5 .In use monomer initiator and terminator pass from lines 6, 7 and 8 into mixer 2 where they meet aqueous recycled mixture comprising polymer in line 1 and the liquids obtained are passed to pump 3 and pumped through exchanger 4 to cool them prior to separation of a product portion through outlet 5 and recycle of the remaining portion round line 1 and back to mixer 2. Any gases produced in the polymerization or resulting from the feed components are vented from the loop via vent 9. In a modification of the apparatus illustrated, there are 4 feed lines 6, 7, 7A and 8 for monomer, the oxidant part of a redox initiator, the reductant part of a redox initiator and terminator. The invention is illustrated in the following Examples In which the concentrations of ingredients e.g. 0.35M are expressed as molalities e.g. 0.359 moles per kg of solution.Examples 1 11 An apparatus as illustrated in the accompanying drawing but modified to have 4 feed lines 6, 7, 7A and 8 into the mixer was used with an extra heat exchanger as cooler between outlet 5 and mixer 2 in the direction of flow of the liquid in line 1. A reciprocating pump performed the functions of mixer and pump. Feed line 7A was used for sodium metabisulphite solution when sodium chlorate solution was passed via feed line 7 when ammonium persulphate was the initiator, it was passed via line 7, and line 7A was not used. In each Example the monomer was glacial acrylic acid containing 200ppm hydroquinone monomethyl ether and less than 1X by weight water and the initiator, chain transfer agent also called chain terminator and accelerator if any were added in aqueous solution. The initiators were sodium chlorate NC or ammonium persulphate APS , the accelerator sodium metabisulphite BS and the chain terminators thioglycollic acid TGA or mercaptoethanol ME mercapto succinic acid MSA or thioglycerol TGL . The parameters of the process in each Example are given in Tables 1 and 3 .

These slurries contain kaolin, mica and sand, and the deflocculants are added to cause separation of the mica and sand without affecting the kaolin. Two different kaolin slurries from different mines which need different amounts of defl occul ants were treated with the polyacrylate salts above, according to the following procedure. A series of stoppered measuring cylinders 200 wilts were taken and 150 mls of each slurry, with the pH adjusted to 8.5 with sodium hydroxide, were added to each cylinder. The amount of polyacrylate solution being tested was then added. Each cylinder was then shaken vigorously and allowed to stand for 20 minutes. A visual inspection was then made of the deposits in the cylinder. The minimum level of deflocculant which gave a clear hard deposit was taken as the effective level.The test is subjective and in an attempt to give a quantitative assessment the slurries were rated on a scale where 0 corresponds to very little or no separation of mica sand, and 10 to a clear hard deposit of mica sand. The results were as follows, the dosage rate being the weight fn g. of sodium polyacrylate solution prepared in the give Example, expressed as a percentage of the volume in mls. of the slurry.
