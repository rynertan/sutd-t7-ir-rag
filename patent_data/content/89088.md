# FM receiver for receiving FM signals with transmission identification.

## Abstract
Receiver comprising an aerial input having connected thereto a tuning unit 1 to which there are connected, in succession, an IF unit 2 , an FM detection circuit 3 , a pilot regeneration circuit 10 for regenerating a pilot, a demodula tion arrangement 12 for demodulating the code signal which contains transmission identification information, a clock regeneration circuit 18 which is connected to both the pilot regeneration circuit 10 and the demodulation arrange ment 12 and comprises a resettable phase search circuit 18 for producing a clock signal whose frequency is derived from the regenerated pilot and whose phase is derived from the demodulated code signal, a clock controlled decoding circuit 13 for decoding the code signal and a clock controlled signal processing unit 17 . For the purpose of stabilizing the processing, for example, for the reproduction of the transmission identification information, more specific ally with mobile reception, use is made, in the event of disturbances of the code signal, of correctly decoded bits which were stored during undisturbed reception in a mem ory circuit 15 . Only in the event of extreme interferences the phase search circuit 18 of the clock regeneration circuit 18 and also the other clock controlled circuits 13 17 are reset to correct a possible phase slip of the clock signal.
