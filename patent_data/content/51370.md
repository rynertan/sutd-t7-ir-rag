# COMBUSTION HEATER

## Abstract
A porous ceramic heating reactor 20 is positioned within a tubular 12C casing to contain the flame and the end products of combustion. A flattened portion 12D of the casing extends substantially past the reactor to provide for further transfer of heat through the casing wall from the hot exhaust gases and to carry those exhaust gases to a safe point of exhaustion. Turbulent flow of the hot gaseous products of combustion increases heat transfer. Each reactor has a spark plug 26 one of whose elements is a bi metallic strip 34 . In a multi unit installation the spark plugs are connected in parallel across the spark generator and operate in sequence. The sequence will continue. A normally open pressure responsive switch 44 is connected to sense the difference in pressure between the fuel inlet line to the reactor and the combustion chamber within the casing. If the pressure differential is not maintained, the switch opens and shuts down the system. A slow blow fuse 38 prevents shutdown for a 15 second period sufficient to permit the initiation of ignition.
