# Variable area fuel cell cooling.

## Abstract
A cooling module 42 for a fuel cell arrangement 10 having cooling fluid flow passages 44 which vary in surface area from the inlet to the outlet of the passages. A smaller surface area is provided at the passage inlet, which increases toward the passage outlet, so as to provide more uniform cooling of the entire fuel cell. The cooling passages 44 , can also be spaced from one another in an uneven fashion. The ability to provide more uniform cell temperature and conse quently to increase the cell temperature for a given maximum level means a reduction in the effect of carbon monoxide poisoning. Also, a reduction in air flow reduces the power required to circulate cooling air stream.
