# SCALE ASSEMBLY WITH IMPROVED PLATFORM

## Abstract
A scale assembly for use in weighing loads including a platform to receive a load and a plurality of transducers to provide and output indicative of the magnitude of the load. The improved platform includes top and bottom panels which are supported by sheet metal rib panels arranged in a beam truss construction. The beam truss arrangement of the rib panels enables horizontal and vertical shear forces to be transmitted through the rib panels. Thus construction results in the platform having a high strength and rigidity to weight ratio. Thus, each of the rib panels extends throughout the length of the scale platform and has major side surfaces which are skewed relative to the top and bottom panels. The rib panels cooperate with the top and bottom panels to define a plurality of empty cavities which have a triangular cross sectional configuration and extend lengthwise of the scale platform. Some of the cavities are disposed in an upper array which extends downwardly from the top panel. Other cavities are disposed in a lower array which extends upwardly from the bottom panel. The cavities in the lower array are interspersed with the cavities in the upper array.
