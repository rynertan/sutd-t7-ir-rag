# Magnetic head.

## Abstract
Magnetic head for a magnetic recording and playback apparatus, comprising a core of a Mn Zn ferrous ferrite having a very high saturation magnetization. The Mn Zn ferrous ferrite has a composition not counting optional subsitutions according to the formula Mn The result is that the magnetic head may be used in combination with magnetic tapes having a very high coer cive force up to 104 kA m 1300 Oersted and may be used for transducing signals having a frequency of a few MHz.
