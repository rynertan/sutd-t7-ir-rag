# Scroll type fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
A scroll type fluid displacement apparatus 1 having a pair of interfitting, relatively orbiting scroll members 24, 25 which define a plurality of moving fluid pockets. A fluid passage 244 through the end plate 241 of one of the scroll members 24 has an elongated shape to reduce contact of the axial end of the other scroll member 25 with the edge of the fluid passage, thereby reducing wear and improving volumetric efficiency.
