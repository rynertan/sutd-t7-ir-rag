The disclosures of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference. Field Of The Invention The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing nickel ylides which are useful as catalysts for the oligomerization of ethylene. This invention also relates to novel intermediates obtained in such a process and to the methods for preparing such intermediates.Description Of The Prior Art It is well known in the art to use a variety of catalysts to oligamerize ethylene to higher molecular weight olefins. The term oligomerize has been employed, and is employed herein to describe the conversion of lower olefins such as ethylene to olefinic products of higher molecular weight, e.g., to dimer, trimer, tetramer and the like. The reaction rate and product distribution obtained are highly dependent on the exact catalyst composition and the reaction conditions employed. Two such general classes of catalysts are the wZ egler types consisting of aluminum trialkyls and the WZiegler Natta types consisting of aluminum alkyls or alkyl halides and titanium halides.Major disadvantages of aluminum alkyl catalysts are their highly reactive and pyrophoric nature and the fact that they must be used at relatively high temperatures, e.g., 200 275 C. and pressures, e.g., 2000 4000 psig 13,790 to 27,580 kPa . Although much milder reaction conditions are used when the aluminum alkyls are used in conjunction with titanium halides, product quality and ease of catalyst separation from products of both of these prior art types of catalysts are not as high as desired. An article by W. Keim, F.H. Kowaldt, R. Goddard and C. Kruger entitled Novel Coordination of Benzoyl methylene triphenylphosphorane in a Nickel OligomerizationCatalyst , in Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1978 No. 6, page 466, discloses the preparation of a nickel ylide by the following reaction EMI3.1 wherein cod represents 1,5 cyclooctadiene and Ph represents phenyl. It is reported that the resultant nickel ylide converts ethylene into alpha olefins or polyethylene.Summary Of The Invention A novel process has now been found for preparing nickel ylides which are themselves novel compounds defined by the following Formula I EMI3.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, and R7 are either alike or different members selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl radicals having from about one to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably from about one to about 10 carbon atoms aryl radicals having from about six to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably from about six to about 10 carbon atoms alkenyl radicals having from about two to about 30 carbons atoms, preferably from about two to about 20 carbon atoms cycloalkyl radicals having from about three to about 40 carbon atoms, preferably from about three to about 30 carbon atoms aralkyl and alkyl radicals having from about six to about 40 carbon atoms, preferably from about six to about 30 carbon atoms a halogen radical selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, preferably chlorine a hydroxyl group an alkoxy,or aryloxy group and a hydrocarby group, such as defined above, carrying halogen, hydroxyl or alkoxy or aryloxy R4 R5 and R6 are either alike or different members selected from the group consisting of a hydrocarbyl group as defined above, a sulfonato group SO3 or a sulfonated hydrocarbyl group M is sulfur or oxygen, preferably oxygen E is phosphorus, arsenic, antimony or nitrogen, preferably phosphorus and F is phosphorus, arsenic or antimony, preferably phosphorus.The process comprises sulfonating a metal yiide defined by the following FormulaII EMI4.1 to obtain the sulfonated ylide defined by the followingFormula III EMI4.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R, F and M are as defined above.The sulfonated ylide is reacted with a base to obtain the metal ylide defined by the following Formula IV EMI4.3 wherein R1, R2, R3, R7, F and M are as defined above andA is the cationic portion of the base used. This ylide is then reacted with 1 a zero valent nickel compound and 2 a ligand having the formula EMI5.1 wherein R4, R5, R6 and E are as defined above. The presence of the sulfonato group in the nickel ylides obtained in the process of this invention induces solubility in polar solvents such as water or methanol. This facilitates product removal and separation from the reaction media or the use of extractive techniques, e.g., by the use of aqueous ammonium hydro xide, not possible with the corresponding nickel ylides which do not contain a sulfonato group.Description Of The Preferred Embodiments In the process of this invention, the first step involves sulfonating a metal ylide defined by the following Formula II EMI5.2 wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R7, F and M is as defined above to obtain the following sulfonated ylide defined by the following Formula III.EMI5.3 wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R7, F and M is as defined above. In some cases, for example, where R1, R2, R3 and are phenyl, M is oxygen and F is phosphorous, the following following Formula IIIa may more accurately describe the structure EMI6.1 This first step can be done, for example, by dissolving the ylide of Formula II in a suitable solvent, for example, a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as chloroform, dichloroethane, methylene chloride or methyl chloroform, or a hydrocarbon solvent, such as heptane or hexane and then adding S03 to the resulting solution. The ylide and sulfonating agent are generally employed in equal molar amounts, although excess sulfonating agent can be present, if desired.Temperatures can be in the range of about 0 to about 200 C., preferably from about 20 to about 1000C., pressures can be elevated, although atmospheric pressure is preferred, and reaction times can vary from about five minutes to about 24 hours, preferably from about ten minutes to about four hours. At the end of the reaction time the compounds defined by Formula III or fIIa are recovered by any suitable means. If the sulfonated desired product is solid, recovery can be effected by filtration, decantation or by centrifuging. If the desired product is dissolved in the reaction medium, recovery can be effected by distillation to remove the solvent therefrom. The sulfonated product is converted to the corresponding ylide by reacting the same with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide sodium or potassium hydroxide , an alkyl or aryl lithium n butyl lithium, methyl lithium or phenyl lithium , an alkoxide sodium methoxide or potassium t butoxide , a hydrocarbyl substituted am ammonium hydroxide benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide , ammonium hydroxide, ammonia, etc, to produce the following novel ylide defined by Formula IV EMI7.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R7, F, M and A are as defined above.This can be done, for example, by suspending or dissolving the sulfonated ylide in a suitable liquid, such as water, an alcohol ethanol or isopropanol , an aromatic benzene or toluene , a hydrocarbon hexane or heptae , etc. The reaction temperature can range from about room temperature to about 200 C., preferably from about room temperature to about 50 C., and the reaction time from about one minute to about four hours, or even longer, but preferably from about one to about two hours. Elevated pressures can be used, although atmospheric pressure will suffice. If the ylide obtained is a solid, recovery can be effected by filtration, decantation or by centrifuging.If the ylide is dissolved in the solvent, simple distillation is suffi client to remove the solvent, leaving behind the solid ylide. The sulfonated ylide defined by Formula IV is reacted with 1 a ligand defined by the formula EMI7.2 wherein R4, R5, R6 and E are as defined above, and 2 a zero valent nickel compound. Specific examples of ligands that can be used include allyldiphenylphosphine benzyldiphenylphosphine bis 3 aminopropyl phenylphosphine bis 2 cyanoethyl phenylphosphine bis m fluorophenyl phosphinous chloride 4 bromophenyldiphenylphosphine n butyldiphenylphosphine t butyldiphenylphosphine 2 cyanoethyldiphenylphosphine cyclohexyldiphenylphosphine n decylphenylphos phine diallylphenylphosphine di n amylphenylphosphine di sec butylphenylphosphine di cyclohexylphenylphosphine diethylphenylphosphine di n heptylphenylphosphine di nhexylphenylphosphine dimethylphenylphosphine dimethylp tolylphosphine diphenyl n butoxyphosphine diphenylchlorophosphine diphenylenephenylphosphine diphenylethoxyphosphine diphenylmethoxyphosphine diphenylphosphine beta diphenylphosphinoethyltriethoxysilane di isopropylphenylphosphine di o tolylphenylphosphine divinylphenylphosphine ethyldiphenylphosphine n hexyldiphenyl phosphine o methoxyphenyldiphenylphosphine 2 methyl butyl diphenylphosphine methyldiphenylphosphine methylethylphenylphosphine methylphenylphosphine neomenthyldiphenylphosphine pentafluorophenyldiphenylphosphine 2 phenylbutyl d iphenyiphosphine phenyldi n butoxyphosphine phenyldichlorophosphine phenyldiethoxyphosphine phenyldimethoxyphosphine phenylphosphine isopropyldiphenylphosphine n propyldiphenylphosphine o tolyldiphenylphosphine p tolyldiphenylphosphine tribenzylphosphine tris m chlorophenyl phosphine tris p chlorophenyl phosphine tri l naphthyl phosphine triphenylphosphine tris 4 dimethylaminophenyl phosphine tris p fluorophenyl phosphine tris o methoxyphenyl phosphine tris p methoxy phenyl phosphine tri o tolylphosphine tri m tolylphosphine tri p tolylphosphine vinyldiphenylphosphine sodium diphenylphosphinebenzene 3 sulfonate disodium phenylphosphine bis benzene 3 sulfonate dimethylphenylarsine methyldiphenylarsine triphenylarsine tri p tolylarsine diphenylchloroarsine triphenylantimony triphenylamine tribenzylamine methyldiphenylamine dimethylphenylamine bis 2 cyanoethyl phosphine bis di methylamino methylphosphine t butyldichlorophosphine 2 cyanoethylphosphine cyclohexylphosphine di t butylchlorophosphine dicyclohexylphosphine diethylethoxyphosphine diethyl iso propoxyphosphine diethylphosphine triallylphosphine tri iso butylphosphine tri n butylphosphine tri sec butylphosphine tri t butylphosphine triethylphosphine tri n hexylphosphine trimethylphosphine trifluorophosphine tri iso propylphosphine trin propylphosphine tris 2 cyanoethyl phosphine tris dimethylamino phosphine tris trimethylsilyl phosphine trin butylantimony triethylarsine trimethylarsine methyldiiodoarsine trimethylamine triethylamine tributylamine tripropylamine dimethylamine di n hexylamine dicyclohexylamine diethylamine tricyclohexylamine ammonia and phosphine. Specific examples of zero valent nickel compounds which can be used include tris triphenylphosphine nickel bis cyclooctadiene nickel tetrakis triphenylphosphine nickel bis norbornadiene nickel cycloocta 1,5 diene duroquinone nickel dicyclopentadiene duroquinone nickel bis tetracyclone nickel tetrakis triethylphosphine nickel tris triethylphosphine nickel bis triphenylphosphine nickel dicarbonyl nickel carbonyl nickel II acetylacetonate nickelocene bis tri ethylphosphine nickel II chloride tetrakis trifluorophosphine nickel nickel acetate nickel bromide nickel car bonate nickel chloride nickel fluoride nickel iodide nickel nitrate nickel sulfate nickel 2,4 pentanedionate bisir allyl nickel and nickel dichloride hexaamine. In this step, approximately equal molar amounts of each of the three reactants defined above are dissolved in any suitable unreactive solvent, such as toluene, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or other unreactive hydrocarbon solvents, and stirred while maintaining a temperature of about 0 to about 100 C,, preferably room temperature, for about one half hour to about 48 hours, preferably about three to about 20 hours, sufficient to ensure complete reaction. Any suitable pressure can be used, although atmospheric pressure is preferred. The solvent can be removed from the reaction mixture in any suitable manner, for example, by distillation, including vacuum distillation, if necessary, leaving behind the novel compound defined above. On the other hand, a second solvent in which the desired product is insoluble, such as heptane, can be added to the reaction product to precipitate the novel compound therein. The novel compound can be recovered, for example, by filtration, decantation or by centrifuging.
