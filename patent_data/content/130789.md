# Aqueous colored polymer, process for preparing same and ink comprising same.

## Abstract
An aqueous colored polymer is provided, which comprises a a homopolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated sulfonic acid or its salt or b a copolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated sul fonic acid or its salt with other ethylenically unsaturated mono mer, said homopolymer or copolymer being dyed with a basis dye and having a lowest film forming temperature of not higher than 35 C. The aqueous colored polymer is prepared by poly merizing an ethylenically unsaturated sulfonic acid or its salt, or its mixture with other ethylenically unsaturated monomer by an aqueous solution or emulsion polymerization procedure at a temperature of not higher than 100 C in a specified amount of water and then adding a basic dye to the resulting polymer solution or emulsion, or carrying out this solution or emulsion polymerization in the presence of a basic dye. The aqueous polymer is useful as an aqueous ink such as an ink for the ink jet recording.
