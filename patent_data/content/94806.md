# ARTICLE CARRIER BLANK THEREOF

## Abstract
An article carrier of the wrap around type comprises an open ended sleeve which is adapted for conversion to a basket style carrier which includes end walls and a carrying handle. The sleeve has a pair of spaced apart generally parallel transverse frangible means 54,55 which can be ruptured to facilitate removal of articles accommodated therein and which define a central carrying handle H therebetween. Opposite end portions P₁,P₂ of the sleeve are separated from the central carrying handle following rupture of the frangible mans and are foldable into positions to provide an end at each end of the carrier thereby converting the carrier from its wrap around form into its basket style form.
