# HYDROGEN SULFIDE DECOMPOSITION CELL AND CATALYTIC MATERIALS THEREFOR

## Abstract
A catalytic material for electrochemically oxidizing hyd rogen sulfide or another sulfur containing gas is provided to accomplish decomposition of the gas. The catalytic materials can be incorporated in an anode 22 for use in a electolytic cell 10 for removing sulfur from a contaminated useful gas to produce useful sulfur products. The catalytic materials also can be incorporated in an anode for a fuel cell wherein hyd rogen sulfide or other sulfur containing gas is utilized as the fuel which is oxidized at the anode to produce electrical energy. The catalytic materials of the present invention are of a disordered multicomponent material which includes at least one element selected from the group consisting of transition elements and at least one modifying element selected from the group consisting of sulfur and oxygen. The host matrix and substrate can also include a carbon containing composi tion.
