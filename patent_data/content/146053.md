## Description
The present invention is directed to the obtainment of an antibiotic substance arbitrarily designated as antibiotic L 17392 or deglucoteicoplanin and its salts with bases and acids. From fermentation and purification for instance, through column chromatography operations a teicoplanin product is currently obtained which essentially consists of factor A₂ accompanied by minor amounts of factor A₃. Recent studies shows that teicoplanin factor A₂ and its individual main components may be represented by the following formula I wherein All sugar moieties identified above are linked to the core molecule through O glycosidic bonds. A substance having the same structural formula as the one attributed to deglucoteicoplanin is disclosed in European Patent Application EP A 0090578 and is named antibiotic A 41030 factor B. This substance is obtained by means of a microbiological process which involves the fermentation of the strain In the copending European patent applications EP A 201540 and EP A 119575 have been described partial hydrolysis products of teicoplanin s factor A₂ wherein one or two sugar moieties are split off. These products are respectively named antibiotic L 17054 and L 17046. The products are obtained by submitting teicoplanin factor A₂ to some specific acid hydrolysis conditions. For L 17054 the hydrolysis is preferably carried out by using 0.5 N hydrochloric acid at a temperature between 70 C and 90 C for 15 to 90 minutes. For L 17046, the hydrolysis is preferably carried out by using hydrochloric acid at a concentration from 1 N to 3 N at a temperature between 70 C and 90 C for 30 to 60 minutes. According to the object of this invention it has been found that antibiotic L 17392 deglucoteicoplanin and its salts with bases and acids may be obtained by submitting to controlled strong acidic hydrolysis conditions a teicoplanin compound or a teicoplanin like compound. It is known that removal of all sugars moieties from a complex molecular structure such as that of glycopeptide antibiotics always present considerable difficulties since mild acid hydrolysis conditions usually afford only partial removal of sugars moieties while strong acid hydrolysis conditions promote partial degradation of the substrate and or changes in the stereochemical configuration of chiral centers. For instance, for avoparcin, a known glycopeptide antibiotic, the true aglycone was never isolated. According to a most preferred embodiment of this invention, primary and secondary alkanols and secondary cycloalkanols of 5 to 10 carbon atoms are usefully employed as the reaction solvent of the controlled strong acid hydrolysis of this invention. Examples of said alkanols are The thus obtained product is substantially pure deglucoteicoplanin showing satisfactory physico chemical and biological characteristics for use in the applications described below. On the basis of the physico chemical data and by comparison with other glycopeptidic antibiotic substances, such as vancomycin and ristocetin, the following structure can tentatively be attributed to deglucoteicoplanin Deglucoteicoplanin possesses acid and basic functions and therefore it can be transformed into its salts with bases and acids according to procedures known per se in the art. Said methods include reacting the acid or basic function of deglucoteicoplanin with an equivalent amount of the appropriate base or acid in water preferred procedure for the salts with bases or in a mixture of water and butanol 30 70 preferred procedure for the salts with acids and lyophilizing the obtained aqueous solution salts with bases or concentrating the water butanol suspension salts with acids to substantially eliminate the water and then adding an excess of ethyl ether to precipitate the acid salts . The salts with acids include those with pharmaceutically acceptable acids e.g., those derived from the following acids hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, glycolic, lactic, pyruvic, malonic, succinic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, benzoic, hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, cinnamic, 2 phenoxybenzoic, methanesulfonic and 2 hydroxyethane sulfonic acid. The Deglucoteicoplanin was found to be very active against staphylococci In experimental infection in mice infected with The compounds of the present invention can be administered orally, topically or parenterally, the parenteral administration being preferred.
