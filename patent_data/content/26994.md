# Carbon cloth based electrocatalytic gas diffusion electrodes, assembly and electrochemical cells comprising the same.

## Abstract
Thin gas diffusion electrodes comprising open pore car bon cloth substrates 1 provided with a uniform mixture of ca talytic carbon particles and preferably Teflon particles 2, 3 adhered within the cloth pores and to the yarns of the cloth, formed into an electrode assembly with a plurality of closely spaced preferably noble metal current collecting contacts 4 throughout the area of the cloth and connected to external ter minals for use in electrochemical cells, including metal air bat teries and zinc electrowinning cells and the like, operating at high current densities.
