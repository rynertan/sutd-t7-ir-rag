# Electrical plug with switch.

## Abstract
An electrical plug comprises a plug body 16 which houses two or more electrical terminals for connection to electrical cables, at least one of the terminals 28 being conductively connectable and disconnectable from its re spective contact pin 22 . To achieve this, the plug body is provided with a tumbler switch 30 , operable to effect electrical contact between a spring contact 36 permanently conductively connected to the contact pins 22 and the terminal 28 by means of a lever 38 , pivoted at 40 and normally biassed out of contact with the terminal 28 by means of the spring contact 36 . The rocker 32 of the switch 30 may be operated manually, but manual operation will be over rdden on insertion and withdrawal of the plug from its complementary socket. The automatic switch con trol means comprises an axially slidable pin 46 projecting from the plug body 16 in the switch on position and retractable into the plug body on engagement between the axially slidable pin 46 and the front face of the complemen tary socket, to urge the switch 30 into the off position. The free end 52 of the pin 46 may be provided with a cam surface for cooperation with the socket on withdrawal of the plug from the socket, to switch the plug off on withdrawal as well.
