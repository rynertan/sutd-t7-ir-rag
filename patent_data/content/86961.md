# MULTILAYER BOARD FOR THE INTERCONNECTION OF HIGH SPEED CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A panel board has a first voltage layer sandwiched between two ground layers at a close spacing to produce a large distributed capacitance the two ground layers are connected by plated through conductive holes spaced regu larly across the board a second exposed voltage layer is connected by regularly spaced plated through holes to the first voltae layer, increasing the current carrying capacity of, and reducing the resistance access, the board the plated through holes are arranged in rows and columns in a pattern permitting the mounting of decoupling capacitors, at any point on the board, in a position parallel to the rows or parallel to the columns and a socket terminal can be electrically connected directly to the exposed voltage layer or to the exposed ground layer using a ring connector.
