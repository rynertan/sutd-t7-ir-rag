# Conductive pyrolyzed dielectrics and articles made therefrom.

## Abstract
A conductive dielectric structure is disclosed wherein a thermoplastic matrix has a multitude of electrically conductive channels through its thickness and, optionally, at least one electrically conductive surface which, along with protective and heat seal layers, can be formed into conductive belts.
