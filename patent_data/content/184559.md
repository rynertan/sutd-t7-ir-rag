# Laser utilising a negative branch unstable cavity resonator.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a laser utilising a negative branch instable cavity resonator, comprising two opposed and aligned reflecting mirrors 1, 2 , and a baffle 8 aligned with the optic axis 3 of the cavity and located in close proximity to the effective focal point of at least one of the mirrors, as determined by the influence of the cavity s remaining optical components. The baffle is provided with a pin hole 10 of size such as to stop down the focal spot at its first minimum level of luminous intensity from centre. The laser beam, which is coupled out by conventional techni ques, possesses optimum intensity distribution characteris tics in space, and can be focused almost to the limits of diffraction.
