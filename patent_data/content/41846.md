# Induction type positioning system.

## Abstract
A structure 1 is provided with a main pole 1a , an auxili ary pole 1b magnetically connected to the main pole 1a , and a single phase AC field generating coil 3 . Relative movement is possible between this structure 1 and a con ductive plate 2 . The system develops a force between the structure 1 and the conductive plate 2 by induction of eddy currents IE1 and IE2 in the conductive plate 2 .
