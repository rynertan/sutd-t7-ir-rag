## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONSFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the treatment of cancer primarily, but not exclusively, in the field of human medicine, and to compositions for use therein.TRANSFORMATION The drug thioproline thiazolidine 4 carboxylic acid , of formulaEMI1.1 has recently been found to have an anti cancer effect in humans Brugarolas et al. Lancet, page 68, 12th January 1980 . The effect of the drug was discovered because of its ability to induce what is known as reverse transformation in certain cultured cell lines. These cell lines, derived from normal human and animal cells, behave in many respects like spontaneously occurring cancer cells.Normal cells can be transformed by agents such as radiation, infection with certain viruses and by chemical carcinogens.The transformed cells multiply rapidly, like cancer cells, and generally show the morphological and biochemical characteristics of such cells, as discussed further for example in Johnson et al,Proc. Nat. Acad. Sc. U.S.A., 68 425 429 1975 and Puck, ibid, 74 4491 4495 1977 .RELATION TO ESSENTIAL FATTY ACID METABOLISM One particular characteristic shown by human and animal cancer cells and by transformed cells is a consistent absence of the enzyme delta 6 desaturase which converts linoleic acid to y linolenic acid. The inventor believes that this fact is of great significance and that faulty essential fatty acid metabolism is a key factor in cancer. The pathways of EFA transformation in the body are in outline as below EMI2.1 tb SEP cis linoleic SEP acid tb SEP 9i2 octadecadienoic SEP acid tb SEP Nlinolenic SEP acid SEP GLA tb SEP 6, SEP 9,12octadecatrienoic SEP acid tb SEP dihomo N inolenic SEP acid SEP DGLA tb UGLA SEP s SEP 5,8,11eicosatrienoic SEP acid tb ester tb reserves SEP I SEP 1 SEP series tb small SEP SEP SEP PGt tb SEP AA tb SEP Large SEP SEP SEP Arachidonic SEP acid SEP AA tb SEP AA SEP ester SEP SEP 8,11,14 SEP 8 SEP eicosatetraenoic SEP acid tb SEP reserves SEP tb SEP 2 SEP series tb SEP PG s tb The broad outline of the pathways is well known, and it brings out clearly that a major function of essential fatty acids EFAs is to act as precursors for prostaglandins, 1 series PGs being formed from dihomo y linolenic acid DGLA and 2 series PGs from arachidonic acid AA . DGLA and AA are present in food in only small quantities, and the major EFA in food is linoleic acid which is first converted to y linolenic acid GLA and then toDGLA and AA. The conversion of linoleic acid to CLA is blocked by a high fat and high carbohydrate diet, by ageing and for example by diabetes. Stores of AA in the body in the form of lipid esters are very large indeed. In contrast only small amounts ofDGLA ester are present. DGLA is the key substance. GLA is almost completely and very rapidly converted in the body to DGLA and so for practical purposes the oral administration of DGLA and GLA amount to the same thing.DGLA can be converted to a storage form, or to PGs of the 1 series, or to arachidonic acid and thence to PGs of the 2 series.The conversion to arachidonic acid is irreversible. Accordingly it can be seen that since y linolenic acid is a necessary precursor of dihomo y linolenic acid and thus of 1 seriesPGs, and since also cellular stores of DGLA are very limited, cancer cells and transformed cells soon lose the ability to make 1 seriesPGs and in particular the important compound PGE 1. SIGNIFICPECE The inventor believes that many of the characteristic features of transformed and cancer cells are due to this damage to PG metabolism and accordingly further that thioproline and other inducers of reverse transformation will be more effective in the treatment of cancer, particularly in the long term, if they are supported by measures to restore production of 1 series PGs and particularlyPGE 1 in the cells. Such measures lie in particular in the provision of GLA or DGLA from either natural or synthetic sources, to by pass the block at the delta 6 desaturase and enable cells which had lost the enzyme to continue to make PGE 1. It may be noted that having regard to the inventor s view of the connection between 1 series PG metabolism and reverse transformation, it would be expected that substances such as PGE 1 might themselves induce the reverse transformation process.It is therefore significant that it is in fact known that PGE 1 is able to induce reverse transformation in cultured cells, possibly through stimulating production of a nucleotide known as cyclic AMP which is also known to induce the transformation.These reverse transformation inducing properties have been known since 1971, but the inventor believes that he is the first to recognise their significance in the present context through his concern with prostaglandin metabolism generally, shown for example in his previous patent applications referred to below. Through his approach, it has been possible to see that, while substances such as PGE 1 and cyclic AMP would never be thought of as possible components of therapeutic compositions, being unstable and generally unsuitable for adminstration, restoration of the natural in situ production of 1 series PGs and in particular PGE 1 is of great value.This value has been shown directly in the femaleFisher rat where the growth in both size and weight of the transplantable R3230AC mammary tumour is halved by 25 ul EveningPrimrose oil daily, as a GLA source directly favouring 1 series PG production. Moreover direct evidence of effectiveness of administration of GLA in the form of Oenothera seed oil, combined with Vitamin C, has already been obtained from early results in a group of cancer patients in a Scottish hospital. One man with a papillary bladder carcinoma of fifteen years standing and beyond help by surgery, radiotherapy or conventional chemotherapy has had haematuria controlled over more than a year, with accompanying well being rather than the well known toxic effects of conventional treatments. Similarly, a woman with the whole abdomen infiltrated with an anaplastic carcinoma extensively palpable and confirmed by histological examination, untreatable by normal means, has shown complete regression of the tumours to palpation over a period of fifteen months, again with accompanying well being.Such results indicate the value of the combined approach of such measures with the present invention discussed below.THE INVENTION The invention accordingly lies in the use of thioproline particularly and, more generally, agents suitable for therapeutic administration and capable of bringing about reverse transformation, in combination with y linolenic acid and or dihomo y linolenic acid, optionally in association with linoleic and if desired other fat acids, said thioproline or other reverse transformer and or y linolenic or dihomo y linolenic acids being used if desired as physiologically functional salt, ester or other derivatives thereof. Both the compositions of these materials and their use adrinistered separately or together in the treatment of cancer are within the purview of the invention. RELATIONSHIP TO PREVIOUS PROPOSALS The above approach may be used in combination with the use of other materials as disclosed in the inventor s pendingEuropean Patent Applications Nos. 79.300079.5, 79.300546.3 and 80.301510.6 Publication Nos.0003407, 0004770 and 0019423 andU.S. Patent Application Nos. 004 924, 029 058 and 150 402. These materials include zinc, penicillin and ss lactam antibiotics generally, European Patent Application No. 79.300079.5 etc and also penicillamine, phenformin and levamisole EuropeanPatent Application No. 79.300546.3 etc when the other effects of these materials are acceptable, all of which are believed to enhance mobilisation of DGLA reserves and hence ensure that administered GLA and DGLA go into synthesis of PGs. The materials also include ascorbic acid, ethyl alcohol, and naloxone, nalorphine, levallorphan and other opiate antagonists European Patent Application No. 80.301510.6 etc. , a class which enhance physiological synthesis of 1 series PGs fromDGLA without substantially enhancing synthesis of 2 seriesPGs from AA. Further, there is evidence that thromboxane A2 produced in the body along with the endoperoxides giving rise to 2 seriesPGs indirectly enhances formation of PGE 1. Substances such as colchicine, amantadine, griseofulvin vinblastine, vincristine and other Vinca alkaloids interferon and melatonin, which are also discussed in the pending patent applications EuropeanPatent Application No. 79300546.3 etc and which seem to increase production or action of thromboxane A2, are thus also desirably used in the compositions of the present invention. Reference may be made to the above published specifications for further details. The materials of the present invention may also be used in conjunction with the materials disclosed in unpublished pending Application No.namely chloroquine and other 4 aminoquinolines including amodiaquine and hydroxychloroquine diidohydroxyquin and other 8 hydroxy and 8 aminoquinolines including iodochlorhydroxyquin, chiniofon, pentaquine, isopentaquine and primaquine quinacrine mepacrine and other acridines quinidine, quinine and procaine emetine, metronidazole and other antiprotozoals not already named above and spironolactone and other modified steroids, all of which influence the l series 2 series PG balance in the body in favour of 1 series PGs. The purpose of these materials is thus not only to help in the restoration of 1 series PG production but to maintain a proper l series 2 series PG balance.EFFECTIVE AGENTS Thus DGLA or GLA from any natural or synthetic source alone or with one or more of the agents discussed above is proposed for use with reverse transformation inducing agents to restore 1 seriesPG production. Convenient physiologically functional derivatives of y linolenic acid and dihomo y linolenic acid for use according to the invention include the C1 C4 alkyl e.g. methyl and ethyl esters and the glycerides of the acids. If desired, pharmaceutical compositions may be produced for use in the invention by associating natural or synthetic y linolenic acid or a physiologically functional derivative thereof and or dihomo y linolenic acid or a physiologically functional derivative thereof , as such, with an acceptable pharmaceutical vehicle.It is at present convenient to incorporate the y linolenic acid into compositions in the form of an available oil having a high y linolenic acid content, hence references to oil herein. At the present time known natural sources of oils having a high y linolenic acid content are few there are no known natural sources of significant amounts of dihomo y linolenic acid .One source of oils currently available is the seed of EveningPrimrose species such as Oenothera biennis L. and Oenothera lamarckiana, the oil extract therefrom containing y linolenic acid about 88 and linoleic acid about 72 in the form of their glycerides together with other glycerides percentages based on total fatty acids . Another source of y linolenic acid is Borage species such as Borago officinalis which, though its current yield per acre is low, provides a richer source of y linolenic acid than Oenothera oil. Recent studies on fungi which can be cultivated by fermentation promise a fungal oil source. The seed oil extracts referred to above can be used as such or can for example if desired be fractionated to yield an oily composition containing the triglycerides of y linolenic and linoleic as the main fatty acid components, the y linolenic acid content being if desired a major proportion. Seed oil extracts appear to have a stabilising effect upon any dihomo y linolenic acid or physiologically functional derivative thereof incorporated therein.AMOUNTS OF y LINOLENIC ACID AND RELATED MATERIALS A preferred daily dosage for all purposes for an adult weight ca 75 kg is from 0.05 to 0.1 up to 1, 2, 5 or even 10 g as required of y linolenic acid or equivalent weight calculated as y linolenic acid or a physiologically functional derivative thereof. Amounts may in particular be 0.1 to 1.0 g daily.Such doses correspond to about 2 to 20 g daily of the Oenothera oil discussed below. In place of, or in addition to, y linolenic acid, one may use dihomo y linolenic acid or a physiologically functional derivative thereof in amount equivalent in molar terms to y linolenic acid and calculated as such. This dosage can for example be taken as a single dose or divided into 2, 3 or 4 subdivisions thereof as convenient.AMOUNT OF THIOPROLINE Amounts may be for example 100 mg to 35 g day, conveniently 40 mg kilo body weight day ca 3 g day .AMOUNTS OF OTHER ACTIVE MATERIALS Amounts of materials used as referred to above to augment the effect of the GLA and or DGLA may for example be IZinc 2.5 to 800 mg day, preferably 10 80 mg, calculated as zine Penicillin V or other calculated as zinc B lactam antibiotics 0.5 to 10 g day Penicillamine 50 mg to 10 g day Phenformin 10 mg to 5 g day Levamisole 10 mg to 2 g day II Colchicine 0.3 to 15 mg day, preferably 0.6 to 2.4 mg Amantadine loo to 1000 mg day Griseofulvin 0.5 to 5 g day Vinblastine 35 to 350 mg week Vincristine 7 to 70 mg week S S Interferon 1 x 10 to 1 x 10 units day Melatonin 10 mg to 5 g day III Ascorbic acid 50 mg to 50 g day Ethyl alcohol 5 to 500 ml day Naloxone 0.1 to 500 mg day Nalorphine 1 mg to 5 g day Levallorphan 0.2 mg to 1 g day or like amounts of other opiate antagonists IV Chloroquine and other materials listed with it earlier, as follows Quinoline derivatives 250 mg week to 2500 mg day Acridine derivatives 100 to 2500 mg day Quinine 100 mg to 10 g day Quinidine 100 mg to 2 g day Procaine 100 mg to 10 g day Spironolactone or other asteroid derivatives 30 mg to 2 g day Emetine 10 to 100 mg day Metronidazole loo mg to 10 g day PACKS If it is not desired to have compositions comprising active materials listed above, packs may be prepared comprising the materials presented for separate or part joint and part separate administration in the appropriate relative amounts, and such packs are within the purview of the invention. DIETARY COMPOSITIONS The invention is chiefly described in terms of pharmaceutical compositions, but it will be understood that the y linolenic and other acids, being in the nature of dietary supplements, could be incorporated in a dietary margarine or other foodstuffs such foodstuffs, possibly containing other active materials and generally referred to in this description as dietary or pharmaceutical compositions, are within the purview of the invention and thus of the term pharmaceutical compositions, packs or the like used herein.VETERINARY APPLICATIONS It will be understood that where a disorder of a kind calling for treatment in animals arises, the invention while described primarily in terms of human medicine and treatment is equally applicable in the veterinary field.PHARMACEUTICAL PRESENTATION The compositions according to the invention are conveniently in a form suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral or topical administration in a suitable pharmaceutical vehicle, as discussed in detail for example in U.K. Patent Specification No. 1 082 624 and in any case very well known generally for any particular kind of preparation. Thus for example tablets, capsules, ingestible liquid or powder preparations, creams and lotions for topical application, or suppositories, can be prepared as required.Injectable solutions of hydrolysed Oenothera oil may be prepared using albumin to solubilise the free acid. Advantageously a preservative is incorporated into the preparations. a Tocopheral in a concentration of about 0.1 by weight has been found suitable for the purpose. It will be understood that the absolute quantity of active ingredients present in any dosage unit should not exceed that appropriate to the rate and manner of administration to be employed but on the other hand should also desirably be adequate to allow the desired rate of administration to be achieved by a small number of doses. The rate of administration will moreover depend on the precise pharmacological action desired. The following Examples serve to illustrate pharmaceutical compositions useful in treatment according to the invention EXAMPLES Pharmaceutical compositions containing a unit dose of an oil extract from the seeds of Oenothera biennis L. optionally with methyl dihomo y linolenate and or zinc oleate, penicillin V, colchicine or any of the other active materials referred to herein, are prepared by encapsulation of the natural oil in soft gelatin capsules manufactured by known methods. The oil is extracted from the seeds by one of the conventional methods of extraction such as cold pressure, screw pressure after partially cooking the seed, or solvent extraction. Fractionation of a typical sample of this oil shows a yield of 97.0 oil in the form of methyl esters, with the relative proportions Palmitate 6.15 Steerate 1.6 Oleate 10.15 Linoleate 72.6 y linolenate 8.9As preservative, a tocopherol is added to the oil in a concentration of 0.1 . Gelatin capsules containing oil extracts prepared as described above, each having the following contents of active ingredients 0.5 g oil extract ca 0.045 g y linolenic acid , are prepared in conventional fashion. EXAMPLE 1 The following capsules may be given, two capsules three times a day, in the treatment of cancer Capsules containing Oil extract 0.5 g Thioproline 500 mg FURTHER EXAMPLES A Similarly capsules containing additional materials may be administered, for example, 10 mg methyl dihomo y linolenate per capsule as a direct supplement to the oil or for example for their indirect action zinc opiate 10 mg or penicillin V 0.25 g compare the Examples of European Patent Application No. 79300079.5 or U.S. Patent Application No. 004 924 referred to earlier or phenformin 25 mg, levamisole 25 mg or penicillamine 100 mg per capsule, or colchicine 0.2 mg, amantadine 100 mg or griseofulvin 0.5 mg per capsule compare the Examples of European PatentApplication No. 79300546.3 or U.S.Patent Application No, 029 058 referred to earlier and also the use in conjunction with vincristine, vinblastine, melatonin and interferon referred to therein or ascorbic acid 100 mg, naloxone 5 mg, nalorphine 5 mg or levallorphan 5 mg compare the Examples of European Patent ApplicationNo. 80301510.6 or U.S. Patent Application No. 150 402 referred to earlier and also the use in conjuction with ethyl alcohol to give 30 to 300 mgt alcohol in the body referred to therein .
