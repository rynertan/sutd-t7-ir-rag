# A thermomagnetic recording medium and a method of thermomagnetic recording.

## Abstract
A thermomagnetic recording medium 110 is provided consisting of a higher coercive force layer 102 , which can be vertically magnetized and has some lower Curie point, arranged on one surface of a substrate 101 , and a lower coercive force layer 103 , which has some higher Curie point, arranged on another surface, said higher coercive force layer and said lower coercive force layer being reciprocally exchange combined mutually interacting . Further, a method of thermomagnetic recording employing said ther momagnetic recording medium 110 is also provided. Said method consists of writing in information by heating said higher coercive force layer 102 at approximately Curie point employing converged laser light.
