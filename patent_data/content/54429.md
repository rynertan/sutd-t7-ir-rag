# A Technique for synchronisation of Raman scattered radiation.

## Abstract
As shown in Figure 1, a device 10 provides a pair of intense 16 micron pulses through exit port 11 by simu lated Raman scattering of CO₂ laser radiation provided by CO₂ lasers 12 and 15 in parahydrogen 13 maintained in chamber 14 between spherical mirrors 16 and 17 . The CO₂ laser radiation is passed through lenses 20 and 25 , combined by beam combiner 30 , passes through entrance port 18 , reflects between mirrors 16 and 17 and passes out through hole 21 to exit port 11 . Lenses 20 and 25 mode match the CO₂ laser radiation to the structure formed by mirrors 16 and 17 .
