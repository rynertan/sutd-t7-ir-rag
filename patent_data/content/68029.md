# METHOD OF CONTROLLING WIRE CUT ELECTRIC DISCHARGE MACHINING.

## Abstract
A method of controlling the machining in a wire cut electric discharge machining apparatus for machining workpiece in a prescribed shape, which makes it possible to reduce the machining error in corners caused by deflec tion of the wire electrode by the steps of applying a voltage between the wire electrode and the work, cutting the work with the discharge energy, and moving the work relative to the wire electrode in accordance with machining instruction data. An override amount K is obtained by an override amount calculator 103b using corner radius data r and a corner angle data ϑ applied as machining instruction data from paper tape 101 , and a relative speed F is calculated by a relative speed calculator 103f using the override amount K and the instructed feed speed F₀ . Motors MX, MY are respectively rotated via pulse distributors 105X, 105Y and servo circuits SVX, SVY in accordance with the relative speed F lower than the instructed feeding speed F₀ , the work is moved relative to the wire electrode, and the corner is electrical discharge machined.
