## Abstract
Semi automatic ticket issuing machines provided with a memory are intended to be operated e.g. on board buses during successive working periods by operators who receive cash to be accounted for later on as pay ment for ticket issued. In order to facilitate the operators accounting work each ticket issuing machine is adapted to register upon completion of each working period a cash balance record for the working period just complet ed on an accounting medium intended for the operator in question.

According to the invention each ticket issuing machine is adapted to register on said accounting medium intended for the operator besides said cash balance record to the working period just completed also a second predetermined number of said retained cash balance records, relating to immediately preceding working periods, said second predetermined number be ing at the most equal to said first predetermined number.
