# Fluid fuel fired burner.

## Abstract
The flame temperature of a fluid fuel fired burner 10 is reduced by mixing flue gas 35 with the combustion air supply 34 before introduction of the fuel and combustion take place. The NOX produced by the process of combustion is thereby reduced. The flue gas 35 may also be induced from the fur nace remote from the flame zone of the burner 10 to improve NOX reduction. A venturi 21 may be used to induce the flue gas 35 from the furnace.
