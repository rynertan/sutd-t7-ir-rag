# A numerical controlled machine tool making intermediate measurements.

## Abstract
A numerical controlled machine tool apparatus capable of providing intermediate measurement in process mea surement during the carrying out of a machining process on a workpiece. A spindle 13 of the apparatus, usually used for mounting a machining tool, is also capable of mounting a measuring tool which generates a contact signal when the measuring tool on the spindle is brought into contact with the workpiece W . A measuring control unit 16 19 includ ing a memory 18 is capable of compensating for any deviation that may exist between the centre acid line of the measuring tool and the center axis line of the spindle, thereby making the apparatus capable of carrying out accurate measurements and adjusting a machining process based on the result of such an accurate measurement.
