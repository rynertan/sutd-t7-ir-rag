# Consumable electrode type pulse arc welding machine.

## Abstract
A consumable electrode type pulse arc welding machine is provided with means for controlling a welding output of the welding machine and the control means comprises a short circuiting detector circuit 1, 2, 3 for detecting the number of times of short circuiting n occurring between an electrode wire and a weld part of a base metal at predetermined time intervals during a welding operation, a processing unit 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 28 for calculating nd ns n, where ns is a preset number of short circuiting times, and a control means 13, 14, 15 for controlling a welding output of the welding machine by decreasing the welding arc voltage in accordance with the magnitude of nd, when nd is larger than zero, and by increasing the welding arc voltage in accordance with the magnitude of nd , when nd is smaller than zero.
