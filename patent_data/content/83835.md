# STABILIZATION OF DIAZO RESIN SENSITISERS

## Abstract
Light sensitive compositions and materials incorporat ing such compositions, such as coated films for the produc tion of polymeric resists, comprise a diazo resin as a sensitizer for the composition and a water soluble or water dispersible colloid. In order to stabilize the diazo resin sensitizer and increase the time between manufacture and use of such light sensitive compositions and material, a poly vinylpyridine is incorporated in the composition, preferably in the form of a water soluble salt such as the hydrochloride or sulphate.
