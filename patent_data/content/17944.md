# Thermospray method for production of aluminium porous boiling surfaces.

## Abstract
A method for producing a porous boiling surface with ex ceptional adhesion qualities and mechanical strength while at the same time maintaining the high degree of open cell porosi ty required for effective boiling heat transfer wherein a bond coating of pure aluminum is produced using a thermospray gun to melt an aluminum wire and impinge the molten alumi num particles against the metallic substrate in an inert gas stream projected from the gun nozzle located between 2 and 4 inches from the substrate. The bond coating has a porosity of less than 15 percent and a thickness not greater than 4 mils. The nozzle to substrate distance is then increased to 4 to 10 inches and a top coating of pure aluminum is formed having a porosity greater than 18 percent and a thickness of at least four times the thickness of the bond coating.
