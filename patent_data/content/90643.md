# Colour cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
A colour cathode ray tube has an inner magnetic shield for controlling the magnetic field distribution internal of the tube. The inner shield is formed to have a pair of long side walls and a pair of short side walls provided along an inner wall of a funnel shaped portion of the tube. Each long side wall has formed therein at least one elongated opening in each of the two regions divided by a centre of the long side wall. The openings may take the form of a triangular shaped opening or they may be narrow generally rectangular slots.
