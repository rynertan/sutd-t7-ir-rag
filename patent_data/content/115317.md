# METHOD OF CALIBRATING PRESSURE SENSOR

## Abstract
The present invention features a method of calibrating a pressure sensor disposed in an internal combustion engine which is characterized by delaying the ignition until combus tion pressure is not generated during the compression stroke, recording the pressure history and mathematically deriving the essentially symmetrical half of the motoring pressure wave which occurs within the combustion chamber during the expansion stroke thereby obtaining the total motoring pressure history irrespective of the generation of combustion pressure. This data permits the output of the pressure sensor to be frequently compared with predeter mined motoring pressure values for the same amount of inducted air and thus the value assigned to the output of the sensor to be adjusted to allow for the physical changes which occur within the sensor with temperature and age.
