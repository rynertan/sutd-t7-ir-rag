## Description
Production of Alkylene Oxides and Catalysts Therefor This Invention relates to the production of alkylene oxides and catalysts therefor. It is known to produce alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide, by contacting gases comprising the corresponding olefine and oxygen with catalyst comprising silver on a support which may be an CC alumina support. Such catalysts may be in the form of hollow cylindrical pellets. We have found that the performance of such catalysts may be improved by modifying the shape of the pellets. This invention therefore comprises a catalyst for the production of an alkylene oxide, especially ethylene oxide , by contacting the corresponding olefine and oxygen with the catalyst, which comprise silver deposited on a porous heat resisting support, in which the catalyst is in the form of substantially cylindrical pellets in which the ratio of the length to the diameter is in the range 2 1 to 1 2 pierced by 3 to 15 substantially longitudinal holes passing completely through the pellets, the total volume of the holes within the pellet being 5 to 252 of the volume of the pellets including the holes, the disposition of the holes across the the cross section of the pellet facilitating access of gas to the substance of the pellet. By substantially cylindrical we include pellets of which the outer boundary of the transverse cross section comprises flat surfaces, provided that the angles between such surfaces are not less than about 120 . The pellets may thus be for example hexagonal, or octagonal, but it is preferred that the outer boundary should be substantially circular. As the pellets will normally be made by extruding, cutting, for example by blades, wires or saws and calcining there may be a tendency for some acceptable distortion to occur due to gravity or heating effects before the shape is finally set. The end faces of the pellets may be at right angles to the axis or if desired, may be at an angle to this, for example if it is wished to alter the packing characteristics of the pellets. The holes may be of any cross section for example they may be sector shaped and arranged so that in cross section the pellet resembles a wheel with a rim and spokes, but they are suitably round.The holes are preferably arranged so as to minimise the maximum diffusion path of gases from the surfaces to the interior parts of the substance of the pellets. The catalyst suitably comprises silver supported on a porous heat resisting support which has a specific surface area in the range 2 2 0.05 to 10 m g and preferably 0.1 to 5 m g and more preferably 2 0.3 to 3 m g as measured by the Brunauer, E mett and Teller method.The catalyst may be produced as disclosed in European patent No.3642. The catalyst support preferably has an apparent porosity as measured by the water absorption method of at least 202, for example 25 70 preferably 30 65Z and mean pore diameters of 0.1 to 20 microns preferably 0.3 to 4 microns as measured by the mercury porosimetry method. The pore size distribution of the support may be bi or tri modal, in which case the pores of diameters up to 2 microns preferably account for 30 to 702 of the total pore volume the pores of diameter 2 to 20 microns preferably 0 to 50Z of the total pore volume, and the larger pores preferably 20 to 50 of the total pore volume. Most of the silver content of the catalyst is preferably present in the form of discrete particles adbering to the support having equivalent diameters of less than lO,OOQA preferably in the C range 20 10,0002 and more preferably 40 8,0O for example 100 5,00QA. By equivalent diameter is meant the diameter of a sphere of the same silver content as the particle. Preferably at least 80X of the silver is present as particles having equivalent diameters in the aforesaid range, the quantity of silver being judged in terms of the number of particles falling in that range. The silver is believed to be present largely as metallic silver. The dimensions of the silver particles may be determined by scanning electron microscopy. The support may be an alumina, silicon carbide, silica, zirconia, titania or silica alumina support, but it is preferably composed of an aggregate of alpha alumina particles which may be fused together or cemented together with, for example silica titania or baryta. The catalyst preferably comprises 3 to 50 and more preferably 3 to 30 for example 6 to 28X by weight of silver. It is preferred that the catalyst should contain cations, for example alkali and or alkaline earth metal cations as the corresponding nitrate or nitrite or in a form capable of reacting to produce the corresponding nitrate or nitrite by reaction with nitrate and or nitrite forming substances in accordance with ourEuropean Patent 3642. This is especially preferred if the catalyst is treated with the nitrate or nitrite forming substance intermittently in order to restore its selectivity. It is believed that an effect of such cations is to hold more nitrate and or nitrite ions on the catalyst when it is in use or to hold them longer than is the case in their absence but we do not wish to be bound by any theory as to their action. The cations may be introduced to the support before du ing or after the introduction of the silver compound. Preferably the cations are introduced to a composition in which the silver is present in metallic form on a support. The cations are suitably introduced as solutions in water and or organic solvents. If it is desired to impregnate a catalyst which has already been used in the oxidation of an alkene to an alkylene oxide and has lost performance, this may be carried out also. Suitable concentrations of such cations in a form which is extractable by water may be for example 50 to 5000 parts per million of alkali metals by weight and or 50 to 20,000 parts per million of alkaline earth metals by weight. The cations may be provided for example as nitrates, hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates or carboxylates, for example lactates or more preferably formates or oxalates. The catalyst preferably contains rubidium, cesium, lithium, cadmium, calcium, magnesium, strontium and or barium and or more preferably sodium and or potassium, these elements being present in a form which permits the extraction of their ions from the catalyst by water. Partial pressures of ethylene or propylene in processes according to the invention may be in the ranges 0.1 30 and preferably 1 to 30 bars. The total pressure may be in the range of from 1 to 100 and preferably 3 100 bars absolute. The molar ratio of oxygen to ethylene or propylene may be in the range 0.05 to 100.The partial pressure of oxygen may be in the range 0.01 and preferably 0.1 to 20 bars and preferably 1 10 bars. The oxygen may be supplied for example in the form of air or preferably as commercial oxygen.A diluent for example helium, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide and or methane may be present in proportions of 1080 and preferably 40 70 by volume in total. Suitably the diluent comprises methane as aforesaid together with, for example 100 to 20,000 parts per million by volume of ethane, preferably together with small amounts, for example 10 to 10,000 parts per million by volume of C to C 3 6 alkanes, cycloalkanes or alkenes preferably propylene, cyclopropane, isobutene or isobutane. It is necessary to operate using gas compositions which are outside the explosive limits. The temperature is suitably in the range 180 to 3200C, preferably 200 to 300 C and more preferably in the range 220 to 2900C. Contact times should b sufficient to convert 0.5 70 , for example 2 to 20 and preferably 5 20 of the ethylene and unconverted ethylene is, after separation of the product, suitably recycled, optionally in the presence of unconverted oxygen where appropriate and suitably after partial removal of CO . Suitably 15 to 50t and preferably 2 25 to 40Z of the oxygen fed is consumed. It is preferred that theCO content should be in the range 1X to 8Z and more preferably 1.5t 2 to 6 by volume. The chlorine containing reaction modifier may be of known type. It is preferred that it should be a C to C compound also 1 10 containing hydrogen. It may be for example 1,1 or preferably 1,2dichloroethane but it is preferred to use methyl chloride or more preferably vinyl chloride. Chlorinated aromatic compounds, for example chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and chlorinated toluenes are also suitable. It is preferred that the concentration of the chlorine containing reaction modifier should be in the range 0.1 500 and preferably 1 to 50 parts per million parts of the reaction medium by volume. If a nitrate or nitrite forming substance is used it may be supplied continuously to the process of producing an olefine oxide at a low level for example 0.1 and preferably 0.2 to 200 and preferably 0.5 to 50 parts per million of NO equivalent of the 2 process gas by volume. Not all substances have the same efficiency in forming nitrate or nitrite ions in the catalyst. By NO 2 equivalent is meant the amount of the substance which is equivalent to the specified amounts of NO . In general one mole of NO, 0.5 2 moles of N 0 , and under typical conditions about ten moles of 24 ammonia, three moles of ethylene diamine and two moles of acetonitrile are equivalent to one mole of NO .The values must however be 2 determined experimentally for each compound under the appropriate conditions either by determining the amount equivalent to the desired amount of NO under operating conditions or less suitably by 2 determining the quantity of NO and NO ions deposited on a 3 2 catalyst bed under standard conditions compared with the quantity deposited by NO 2 EXAMPLEHigh purity alpha alumina powder milled and sieved to less than 45 micron particle size, with a crystal size of about 3 micron, was mixed with plasticiser and a water insoluble pore forming agent in a tumbling mixer and water was added gradually to the combined powder, whilst slowly stirring in an open bowl. To ensure thorough distribution of the water the damp powder was pugged twice by screw feeding through a multi hole die plate thus forming a very stiff paste. The stiff alumina paste was divided into two equal portions.The first portion was extruded using a British Ceramic ResearchAssociation two inch screw extruder equipped with a single hole die plate containing a seven pin core rod. The extrudate rope emerging from the die was taken and cut into uniform pellet lengths whilst still wet using a guillotine. The wet pellets were dried in an oven set at 100C to give hard, dry seven hole pellets. Single hole pellets were also produced, in exactly the same way as before, the seven pin core rod in the extruder die being replaced by a single core rod in this case and using the other portion of the alumina paste. Firing was carried out in an electric kiln at 1450 C. Both samples were fired at the same time, and in the process the plasticiser and pore forming agent were totally burned away to leave batches of lightly sintered porous alpha alumina support pellets containing either seven holes or a single hole.These catalyst support pellets comprising high purity alumina containing 450 150 ppm silica expressed as silicon and less than 100 ppm alkali metal in the form of cylinders 8mm diameter and 8mm long pierced in one case by a single central longitudinal hole 3mm in diameter and in the other case by seven longitudinal holes 1.22 mm in diameter one being central and the others being regularly spaced on a circle of 4.39mm diameter centred on the axis of the pellet this giving a similar total volume of the holes were converted to catalyst as described below. The mean pore diameter was 2.4 microns the water porosity was 0.31 0.02 ml g 2 and the surface area was 0.52 n g. Two catalysts were prepared according to the same procedure described below. Silver nitrate crystals 8100 g were dissolved in distilled water 1644 ml to form a concentrated solution. Mono isopropylamine 5838g was added slowly to this solution whilst stirring and cooling, to give a clear solution of silver nitrate mono isopropylamine complex containing 3.8Z w w excess mono isopropylamine.This stock of silver amine complex solution was used to make both batches of catalyst. 13.075kg of seven hole support and 12.105 kg of single hole support were used in making two batches of catalyst. Each support was immersed in the solution at ambient temperatures for a period of 20 minutes before being removed and allowed to drain. The support, wet with silver nitratelamine complex solution, was charged to a perforated basket which was then loaded into a catalyst preparation unit. The impregnated support was heated in a stream of circulating nitrogen, the temperature being gradually increased from 100 C to 2400C over a period of 18 hours. The silver nitrate amine complex decomposed reduztively to leave finely dispersed silver on the alumina. The product was then washed with boiling water for 16 hours, dried and impregnated with a solution of potassium formate 89.3 g in a water 115 al and methanol 22.7751 mixture.This solution was divided between the two batches of catalyst. In each case, the washed, silvered support was totally immersed in circulating potassium formate methanol solution for 20 minutes. This solution was removed and the silvered support allowed to drain for 5 minutes. The vessel holding the silvered support wet with potassium formate methanol was then closed and allowed to stand for 16 hours.Each batch of catalyst was dried in a stream of hot nitrogen. The catalysts were tested as follows. Reactor tubes of 39 mm internal diameter were charged with each catalyst to give bed lengths of 10.7 m bed volume 12.8 1. and 3 m of tube length above each catalyst was packed with inert alumina pellets. The tubes were each surrounded by a liquid heat exchange fluid for temperature control.At startup, a reactor feed gas composition of 0 5Z, C H 27D, 2 24 vinyl chloride 6 ppm, ethane 0.3 , NO plus NO 10 ppm was 2 established the balance being substantially methane with a small proportion of inert gases. The feed to each reactor was at 75 C 1 18.5 bar pressure, with a gas hourly space velocity of 3200 hrReactor temperatures were then raised to initiate reaction. Oxygen, ethylene, ethane, methane, NO and vinyl chloride feeds were then mixed with recycle gas to give the desired feed composition.After 3 3 fifteen days on line 1.22 m hr oxygen, 1.42 m hr ethylene, 15 l.Jhr ethane, 730 ml hr nitrous oxide in methane and 36 ml hr vinyl chloride in methane all expressed as vapour at standard temperature and pressure plus an intermittent flow of methane sufficient to control the plant pressure were mixed with recycle gas to give a reactor feed composition as follows O 7.IX, C H 27 , CO 1.6X, vinyl chloride 7.8 ppm, ethyl 2 24 2 chloride 4.1 ppm, ethane 0.3 , NO 7.8 ppm, NO 4.1 ppm, the balance 2 being substantialLy methane. The reaction feed was at 75 C, 18.5 bar wi h a gas hourly space velocity of 3200 hr and an oxygen conversion across each reactor of 20x. The seven hole pellets gave a selfetivity of ethylene converted of 86.1It at 257 C average catal st temperature and the single hole pellets gave a selectivity of 85.32 at 2580C average catalyst temperature. Thus seven hole pellets were voth more selective and more active. No difference in pressure drop to maintain the flow rates through the reactor tubes was noticed. The product gases from each reactor were cooled to 750C before being combined and contacted with 250 l. hr of water at 20 C, to absorb product ethylene oxide. The resulting gas stream was then split, part being contacted with 250 l. hr of 0.5X w w caustic soda solution in a carbon dioxide scrubber. The scrubber gaseous product and the bypass stream were combined and then compressed to form the recycle gas stream. ppm means, in the case of liquids or solids, parts per million by weight and in the case of gases, parts per million by volume. Gas hourly space velocities are calculated as at standard temperature and pressure.
