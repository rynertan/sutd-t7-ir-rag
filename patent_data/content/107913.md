# Radiation sensitive carrier body utilized as stamper structure.

## Abstract
A radiation sensitive carrier body 20 directly utilized as a stamper has a glass substrate 14 , a first highly adhesive layer 12 securely adhered to the substrate 14 , a radiation sensitive layer 10 which discharges a gas component upon being irradiated with a laser beam and which locally forms a protuberance 30 due to the absorbed energy, a second highly adhesive layer 16 securely adhered to the specific material of the radiation sensitive layer 10 and which deforms in accordance with deformation of the layer 10 , and a metal layer 18 which has a high releasability to allow easy separation from a optical disk substrate material such as an acrylic material when the carrier body 20 is used as a stamper substrate for manufacturing optical disks. A protu berance 32 formed on the carrier body 20 such as a continuous spiral protuberance 32 allows formation of a corresponding spiral groove in the acrylic material, serving as a pre track into which desired information will be digitally written by a user.
