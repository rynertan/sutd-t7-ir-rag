# Multiple bridge, three phase converter arrangement including voltage harmonics cancellation.

## Abstract
All harmonics of an order less than 6 N 1 are cancel led from the fundamental signal presented in each output phase of the three phase converter as the sum of correspond ing phase angle fundamental signals from an N number of converter bridges, where N is a non power of two.
