# Apparatus for producing sweets.

## Abstract
A known device to produce sweets has according to the invention been adapted to produce so called whistle lollies by providing an edge in the mould cavity, which edge cooperates with the mould punch in such a way that a whistle opening is obtained. The mouth piece of the whistle lolly can be formed by a roller having an engraved periphery surface.

## Description
APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING SWEETSThe invention relates to an apparatus for forming sweets out of a sugar strand, on which sweets one can whistle, substantially comprising a rotatable drum with around its periphery a series of recesses which delimit, together with a series of axially slidable mould punches and with flaps hingedly attached to the drum periphery, mould cavities for the sweets0Such an apparatus is known from the Dutch Patent 91 633. This known apparatus is not suited to produce so called whistle lollies. The invention tries to provide an apparatus with which it is possible to produce such whistle lollies in a very efficient way.According to the invention this is achieved by positioning an edge in the recesses, and because the mould punch is formed in such a way and can reciprocate in such a way that sweets are obtained which can be used as a whistle after the pre moulded sugar mass has passed a mouth piece shape member.The mouth piece shape member preferably is a roll with engraved periphery surface. In order to prevent that the sugar mass will be pressed away, a flange can be connected to the periphery surface of the roll. When the sweets must be provided with a stick in order to speak of a so called whistle lolly, than a stick supplying member must be provided to the apparatus.The invention will be further elucidated hereunder, at the hand of the drawing, showing therein as example an embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention. The drawing shows Fig. 1 a vertical cross section over a mould cavity with closed flap,Fig. 2 a schematical side view of the rotatable drum,Fig. 3 the same as in fig. 1 after that a mould punch has totally moved forward into the mould cavity, that is in the position B of fig. 2,Fig. 4 the same as in fig. 1 after that a mould punch has been partially moved back and the sweet are to be found under the mouth piece shape member, that is in the position D of fig. 2, andFig. 5 the same as in fig. 1 on the moment that the whistle lolly can be transported out of the apparatus, that is in position E of fig. 2.The apparatus comprises a rotating drum 1 which at its periphery is provided with recesses 2 and with flaps 3 rotatably connected to the drum, which are also provided with cavities which complete the recesses in the drum periphery till the profile of the lollies.Punches 4 are provided parallel to the axis of rotation of the drum, one punch for every mould cavity in the drum, said punches being axially reciprocatable in the mould cavity. Each mould punch is at its end, laying in the mould cavity, provided with a specially shaped point 5. The recess 2 in this case is half spherical. It can however have any desired other shape. The mould cavity 2 is at its end, facing away from the mould punch 4, provided with a short spherical inner surface 6, while the two flaps 3, which cooperate with the mould cavity, together form a quarter of a spherical inner surface 7 with their ends facing away from their hinging points, said quarter of a spherical inner surface joining the quarter of the spherical surface 6 when the flaps are closed, this in such a way that the surfaces 6 and 7 delimit a half spherical space. The surfaces 6 and 7 can also be embodied with an other profile, so that the space is not a half sphere.In the closed position of the flaps two adjoining flaps and the edge of the mould cavity 2 leave clear a small opening 8, which serves as transport opening for axially inserting a lolly stick 9 into the sugar mass 10 in the mould cavity. The size of the opening 8 is precisely adapted to the diameter of the stick, so that when the stick is being inserted through the opening, no sugar can be pressed out along the stick. In order to prevent pressing out the sugar, it is necessary that the stick has been inserted through the opening, before the real press operation of the mould punch 4 starts.In the embodiment example the stick 9 as well as the opening 8 can have a circular section. Halve the opening is at the upper edge of the surface 6 recessed in the longitudinal axis of the mould cavity, while a quarter of the opening is recessed at the corners of each of the flaps cooperating with the mould cavity.The sticks are supplied from the store barrel 18 and partially inserted in the mould cavity. The situation of fig. 1 is shown in fig. 2 with A. There the sugar mass 10 are cut of the sugar strand 11 by closing the flaps under the influence of a curve 12 fig. 1 .The position B of fig. 2 corresponds to that which is shown in fig. 3, from which it appears that the sugar mass 10 is not only subjected to the stick 9 but also to an edge 19 lastingly provided in the recess 2, which is responsible for the fact that a sharp angled opening appears when the specially shaped point 5 of the mould punch 4 has been moved to the right in fig. 3 in the sugar mass, because of which the lolly can eventually be indicated as whistle lolly.The cross section shape of the whistle lolly is in principal arbitrary. It can have a cylindrical cross section and in that case the edge has been embodied in a circel section shape. When it concerns a guard whistle with a more rectangular section, then the edge can substantially be embodied straight.The reciprocating of the mould punch is obtained in fig. 1 with the aid of the curces 13 and 14.In position C of fig. 2 the mould punch is in the position of fig. 1 and the flap 3 can open so that the sugar mass can in position D be provided with a mouth piece by leading it under a roll 15 with an engraved periphery surface. Said roll 15 ought to be driven with so many revolutions per minute that it has the same periphery speed as an almost finished lolly at the periphery surface which must provide the mouth piece.In order to prevent the sugar mass from being pushed away, a flange 20 can be connected to the periphery surface of the roll. The mould punch now goes further back and will come into positionE of fig. 2, in which position the lolly can be transported out of the apparatus to a not shown cooling installation, to be cooled further.In order to do so the stick can be gripped between fingers 16 which move according to the path 17 of fig. 2.The stick barrel 18 of fig. 1 could also be left away or empty than whistles without sticks are produced, but the opening has to be closed than.
