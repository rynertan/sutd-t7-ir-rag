# Blood donation apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A phlebotomy needle 24 is coupled on one conduit 11 to a source of anticoagulant contained in a flexible bag 2 and on another conduit 12 to a flexible collection bag 1 . The bags 1, 2 are placed in a vacuum chamber 6 within which a vacuum is created, by a hand pump 60 operated by the donor 22 . A rigid plate 4 is disposed between the two bags 1, 2 . The blood flow from the donor is maintained at an adequate flow level by the donor s pumping which provides a pressure differential between the blood collection bag 1 and the needle 24 . The whole blood is mixed with anticoagulant in a Y junction device 26 immediately after passing through the phlebotomy needle. The ratio of whole blood to anticoagulant is independent of the volume of whole blood collected and is fixed by the ratio of the surface areas of the bags 1, 2 in contact with the plate 4 . The anticoagulant may be gravity fed from a bottle 618 if desired. In this event the chamber 6 contains solely the blood collection bag.
