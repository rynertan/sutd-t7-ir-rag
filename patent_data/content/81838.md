# Cyclohexyl and phenyl substituted enkephalins.

## Abstract
The invention relates to novel cyclohexyl and phenyl substituted enkephalins of Formula I which are useful as analgesic agents. In 1975, a pentapeptide, methionine enkephalin, was reported by Hughes et. al. Nature, 258,p577 1975 . This peptide is found in many areas of the brain where it appears to act as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in a central painsuppressant system. The natural peptide binds sterospecifically to partially purified brain opiate receptor sites, see for example, Bradberry et. al., Nature 260, p793 1976 . The natural peptide is also highly active in bioassays for opiate activity but exhibits only weak, fleeting analgesic activity when injected directly into the brain of the rat, see for example, Belluzi et. al., Nature, 260, 625 1976 . In order to overcome the lack of in vivo activity, a number of investigators have made numerous modifications in the methionine enkephalin structure, such as substituting the glycine in the 2 position with a D amino acid, N methylation of the 1 tyrosine substituting the 4 phenylalanine with, for example, methyl or halo modifying the C terminus, etc. to produce enkephalin.
