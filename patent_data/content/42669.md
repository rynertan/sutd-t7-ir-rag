## Description
COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR USE IN ANIMAL FEEDS This invention relates to the use of diazine, triazine and pyridine compounds in increasing production in healthy animals, and to compositions for use as animal feeds. Suitable animals are meatproducing, milk producing, wool producing or egglaying. It is known that meat producing animals can gain weight, and show increased weight gain, when various compounds such as vitamins, minerals, estrogens, antibiotics and or tranquillizers are added to the animal s diet. It has now been discovered that compounds of formulae Ia and Ib can be administered to appropriate animals to increase the rate or amount of weight gain, increase milk production or wool production or the rate of egg laying, or increase feed efficiency. The active compounds have the formulae EMI2.1 wherein X is N or CH Y is N or C R is alkyl of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, inclusive, including isomeric forms thereof R1 is R orEMI2.2 R2 and R3 are the same or different and are hydrogen, provided that R2 and R3 are not both hydrogen, R, cycloalkyl of from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, inclusive, alkyl substituted cycloalkyl of the formulaEMI2.3 alkenyl of from 2 to 8 carbon atoms, inclusive, including isomeric forms thereof, aralkyl wherein Ar is phenyl or substituted phenyl wherein 1 or 2 hydrogens are replaced with chlorine, fluorine, bromine, iodine, R, OR, or CF3, and the substituents can be the same or different, and alkyl is from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, inclusive, including isomeric forms thereof, and R2 and R3 taken together withEMI2.4 is a heterocyclic moiety of from 3 to 8, inclusive, ring atoms and 1 or 2 hetero atoms selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur or a substituted heterocyclic moiety wherein 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the carbon atoms of the heterocycle are substituted with R R4 is hydrogen,EMI3.1 alkenyl of from 2 to 8 carbon atoms, inclusive, including isomeric forms thereof, cycloalkyl of from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, inclusive, or lower acyl wherein acyl is up to and including 5 carbon atoms R5 is hydrogen, R, bromo or chloro R6 is hydrogen,EMI3.2 or lower acyl R7 iS hydrogen or alkyl of from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, inclusive, including isomeric forms thereof N is an integer of from 2 to 7, inclusive.

Administration of the compositions of the present invention can commence for birds shortly after hatching and in the case of mammals, during the creep feeding period of suckling animals when they are starting on solid food and, of course, after weaning. Feeding of the compositions is continued throughout the growing period, lactation period, or egg laying period. In addition to feeding the active ingredient in combination with the feed, the active compounds can alternatively be administered in combination with the animals drinking water or in combination with a pharmaceutical carrier by injection or implantation. The total concentration of the compound of the Formula Ia or Ib in the feed composition is determined with regard to the species of animal, sex, age, weight, and average amount of feed consumed daily. Preferably the compound of the Formula I is employed in the finished feed that will supply the animal with a daily intake of from about 0,02 mg to about 200 mg per head, per day. The following table illustrates the range of compound of Formula Ia or Ib in milligrams daily dose, per head, per day for representa tive animals.

An added advantage was observed in the feeding of sheep. The sheep produced an increased amount of wool. This increase in wool production was attributable to the increase in body size and weight . In addition to the daily administration of a compound of the formulas Ia and Ib, in association with the animal feed or drinking water, daily administration can be accomplished by incorporation of the active compound in a salt block in an amount calculated to provide the active compound based upon the daily salt intake of the animal. In animals that are on open range or for whom daily administration is inconvenient a long active carrier can be prepared for the active compound. Long acting forms can be implants which are placed under the animals skin, injectable fluids or in the case of ruminants, an oral bolus. Implants are prepared for 30 or 90 day administration incorporating 30 to 90 times the daily dose in an inert carrier material. The carrier material can be non degradable by the animals body, e.g. silicone rubber, polyethylene or hydrophilic polymers such as hydron, or degradable polymers such as polyactic acid, polyacetic acid polyglycolic acid copolymer, poly ortho ester , poly E caprolactone or polyglutamic acid. Implants are conveniently implanted in the neck of the chicken, the dewlap of the calf, ear of the pig, or flank of goats and lambs. Long acting 90 day injectable can be prepared incorporated 90 times the daily dose of a compound of the Formula Ia or 1p preferably a water insoluble derivatives such as the acyl diacyl or carbamate form in combination with a sterile injectable fluid carrier such as water, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol or water. Long acting orally administered forms, e.g., a bolus can be prepared for ruminant animals. The bolus can be prepared by the same materials as the implant but is made in a much larger size and ad vantageously has added excioients to increase the specific gravity of the devise. The bolus when administered remains in the reticulum or rumen of the animal and releases the drug over the desired period of time. Excipients to increase specific gravity can be for example, iron pellets, calcium sulfate dihydrate portland cement or plaster of paris.Example 7 Salt Block Salts blocks are prepared for cattle containin9 for 0.001 to OeQ4 percent w w with 0.004 percent w w being preferred.
