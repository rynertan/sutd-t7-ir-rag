## Description
PROiJUCTION Jr D2 YAMIDE MATERIAL SHEET The present invention relates to production of a polyamide material sheet. More particularly, it relates to the production of undrawn and drawn sheets of a thermoplastic polyamide material having excellent physical and chemical properties with a high speed. Hitherto, a sheet of a thermoplastic polyamide material has been prepared by extruding the thermoplastic polyamide material in a melt state in the form of sheet and bring the extruded sheet in a melt state into contact with the surface of a moving chill body for quenching. In such method, a thin layer of air is apt to be introduced between the extruded sheet in a melt state and the surface of the moving chill body, whereby heat transference is lowered.Thus, the extruded sheet is chilled at a lowered rate, and crystallization proceeds to a certain extent in the extruded sheet while chilling. As the result, the obtained sheet has a high crystallinity and is inferior in transparency.Further, the oligomers produced from the extruded sheet in a melt state are carried on by the said thin layer of air and accumulated on the surface of the moving chill body, whereby the chilling effect is considerably deteriorated and also the irregularity in haze is produced in the chilled sheet. Since it is expected that if the tight and close contact between the extruded sheet and the surface of the moving chill body without intervention of the thin layer of air is assured, the extruded sheet would be quickly chilled and the chilled sheet would have a low crystallinity, attempts have been de for realization of the said tight and close contact. One el electr static attraction apparattses instance where . proposed a process for chilling quickly an extruded a thermoplastic polymeric material in a melt state wherein wire like or knife edge like alectrode is provided between a die and a moving chill body to produce an electrostatic charge on the extruded sheet, whereby the tight and close contact of the extruded sheet on the surface of the moving chill body is assured this conventional process being hereinafter referred to as electrostatic pinning procedure U.S. patent 3,223,757 . In this conventional process, however, the tight and close contact is possible only when the take up speed of the extruded sheet is slow. When the take up speed is made rapid, the tight and close contact becomes hardly possible and the improving effect is lost.In order to make large the quantity of the electrostatic charge to be produced on the surface of the extruded sheets the elevation of the voltage was proposed, but in this car discontinuous arc discharge is produced between te electrode and the surface of the moving chill body, whicn leads to breakage of the extruded sheet on the moving chill body. Thus, the elevation of the voltage over a certain Iii t not permissible, and therefore it is impossible to produce a sheet of good quality with a high speed by the electrostat pinning procedure. As the result of an extensive study, it has no been found that the application of a direct current of hi high voltage between an electrode and an extruded sheet to produced discharge in a streamer corona state onto the extruded sheet makes assure the tight and close contact between the ext sheet and the surface of a moving chill body. Even when the take up speed is sufficiently high, the tight and close contact is satisfactorily assured. Accordingly, it is quite possible to produce a sheet of a polyamide material having an even thickness, a good transparency, a low crystallinity and a less irregularity of haze with a high speed. Advantageously, accumulation of oligomers on the surface of a moving chill body is not seen. Further, the above extruded and chilled sheet can be drawn at least in one direction to give a drawn sheet having a uniform thickness, an excellent transparency and a good orientation. It is particularly notable that sequential biaxial drawing is applicable to the said extruded and chilled sheet without any difficulty, because it is commonly known that polyamides are subjected to sequential biaxial drawing with great difficulty due to the strong intermolecula hydrogen bonding in the crystalline portion. According to the present invention, there is provided a process for production of a sheet of a polyamide material which comprises extruding the polyamide material in a melt state in the form of sheet and bringing the extruded sheet in a melt state into contact with the surface of a moving chill body for quenching to give an undrawn film, characterized in that a direct current of high voltage is applied between an electrode and the extruded sheet so as tc produce a discharge in a streamer corona state onto the extruded sheet, whereby the extruded sheet is wrought into tight and close cor act with the surface of the moving chil body electrically grounded so as to be chilled quickly. Throughout the specification, the term polyamide material is intended to rr.ea 7 poly comprising a polyamide as the major o cn.t, jrn the blend, there may be included, in addition to a polyarrde as the major component, any other polymeric material as z well conventional additives. Examples of the polyamidn ara aliphatic polyamides e.g. nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 11, nylon 12 , alicyclic polyamides, aromatic polyamides e.g.condensates of aliphatic diamines and terephthalic an or isophthalic acids, condensates of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids and xylylene diamines , etc. As the other polymeric materials, there may be used polyesters e.g. polycarbonates, polyethylene terephthalate, polytetramethylene terephthalate, poly 1,4cyclohexane terephthalate, polyethylene 2,6 dinaphthalate, copolymer of terephthalic acid with neopentyl glycol , polyolefins e.g. polypropylene, polyethylene, ionomers, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, partially saponified ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer, polyvinyl alcohol , modified polyolefins obtained by graft polymerizing maleic anhydride onto polyolefins, polyalkylene glycols having an average molecular weight of 200 to 10,000, etc. When used, their amount may be saii less than an equal weight to the polyamide, preferably not more than 20 by weight to the polyamide, provided that their incorporation does not substantially afford any influence on the transparency of a sheet prepared from the resulting blend. As the conventional additives, there are exemplified lubricants, anti oxidants, ultraviolet ray absorbers, antistatic agents, pigments, coloring agents, etc. These addi tires e r empl o5ted so the purpose of improving such physical and or ical properties of the resulting blend or a sheet prepared therefrom as lubricity, anti blocking property, draw property, thermal resistance, antistatic property or the like. Examples of the lubricant are organic lubricants such as ethylene bis steareamide , stearyl monoglyceride and 1,5 sorbitan aliphatic ester, inorganic lubricants such as calcium carbonate, kaolin, talc, clay, silicon dioxide and calcium sulfate, etc. The average particle size of the inorganic lubricants may be usually from 0.01 to 10 microns.When used, the amount of the lubricant is preferably from 0.01 to 10 by weight on the basis of the amount of the polyamide and, if incorporated, the other polymeric material. According to the process of the present invention, the polyamide material is extruded in a melt state to make a sheet or a film . Extrusion may be carried out by the use of a flat die such as T die or I die. The extruded product is quenched on the surface of a moving chill body such as a chill roll or a chill belt, whereby a substantially unoriented sheet is obtained. In order to prevent the crystallization in the extruded sheet, the temperature for chilling is kept between OOC preferably the dew point and a temperature of 200c lower than the maximum temperature for crystallization Tc , particularly between OOC and the glass transition point Tg . The said maximum temperature for crystallization can be measured by haze use of a differential scanning calori meter D.S.C. . It is varied with the kind of the polymer, the additive incorporated therein, etc. In case of nylo 6,1 the maximum temperatt e for crystallization is normally 180 to 2000C. When the chilling t t rn T 10 C , the resulting chilli sheet s apt to be deformedTherefore, further chilling at the second stage at a temperature below Tg io0C is recommended.Chilling of the extruded sheet is mainly achieved by the contact onto the surface of a moving chill body but any other cooling measure such as applicatit n of a cold liquid or a cooling gas to the sheet from the opposite side to the existence of the moving chill body may be supplementarily adopted. The surface of the moving chill body may be planished or roughened. It may be made of any electroconductive material such as a metallic material e.g. hard chrome, stainless steel, nickel . As a characteristic feature in the process of this invention, a corona discharge in a streamer corona state Ms produced onto the extruded sheet of the polyamide material before its contact onto the moving chill body by application of a direct electric current of high voltage between an electrode and the extruded sheet. The electrode may be present on any side, i.e. the side of the moving chill body or the side opposite thereto, to the extruded sheet.As tne result of such production of corona discharge, an elec Lic current of several times that in the said conventional electrostatic pinning procedure is applied to the extruded sheet of the polyamide malarial so that its contact onto the surface of the moving chill body in a highly close and tgt state can be assured. The corona discharge in a streamer corona state indicates a stable corona state bridging the electrode and the extruded sheet as shown in Fig. 2.4 on a 73 of S Sakamoto and H. Tagashira New High Voltage Technology published by Asakura Shot2n K.K. in 1974. When the electrode is In a positive potential, the produced corona is concentrated onto the extruded sheet from the terminal end of the electrode in a rod like state. When the electrode is in a negative potential, the produced corona spreads onto the extruded sheet from the terminal end of the electrode in a bell like state. Both may be considered to be within the category of the corona discharge in a streamer corona state. In general, the kinds of corona discharge are as shown in Figs. 1 1 and 1 2 of the accompanying drawings, wherein 1 is the polyamide material in a melt state and 2 is an electrode. As shown in Fig. 1 1 wherein the electrode is set as a negative electrode, elevation of the voltage affords discharge of A dark current, B glow corona, C brush corona, D streamer corona and E spark in order. The polyamide in a melt state is earthed through the moving chill body. When the electrode is set as a positive electrode elevation of the voltage affords, as shown in Fig. 1 2, discharge of A dark current, B glow corona, C streamer corona and D spark in order. The corona discharge in a streamer corona can be produced in a current of 10 mA to 5 A, preferably of 20 mA to 500 mA, per 1 m of the width of the sheet when the takeup speed is 10 to 200 m min. At a higher take up speed, a higher current is favorable. The tightness of the contact of the extruded sheet onto the surface of the moving chill body is substantially decided on the current and is not much influenced by the voltage. With a longer distance between the electrode and the extruded sheet, higher is the voltage, which is usually from 0.5 to 25 ... Although the direct current of high voltage to be used in the present invention may be somewhat added with an alternative current, the use of a source of direct current of which the voltage or current are stabilized as far as possible, particularly of a direct current source having a ripple of not more than 1.0 peak to peak when measured with a dummy resistance connected to the output and the earth terminal, is favored. The electrode may be either of positive potential or of negative potential but the latter is preferred. For stable production of discharge in a streamer corona state, it is favorable to arrange discharge points discontinuously.Thus, the use of a needle like electrode, a sawtooth like electrode a wire like electrode, a knife edge like electrode, etc. having multiple projections or corners in the transverse direction is preferred. The discharge body of the electrode may be made of any electroconductive material such as a metal or carbon. In order to produce discharge in a streamer corona state stably, it is recommended to set a gap of not more than 20 mm, preferably of 0.1 to 10 mm, between the discharge point of the electrode and the extruded sheet. When the discharge point is set with such gap, a brilliant discharge in a streamer corona state is stably produced between the electrode and the extruded sheet. Simultaneously, a high electric current flows. It is notable that the process of this invention is characteristically applicable to a sheet of the polyamide material. When the sheet is made of any other polymeric material, for instance, poiypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate, a stabilize discharge in a streamer corona state is not necessarily produced and discharge in a brush corona state is usually transferred to the one in a spark state without producing any discharge in a streamer corona state in case of elevating the voltage. The thickness of the extruded sheet of the polyamide material is not limitative and may be usually from 10 microns to 3 mm, preferably from 50 microns to 1 mm. The take up speed of the extruded sheet is also not limitative. But, it may be noted that such a high takeup speed as 100 to 200 m min, which can never be adopted in the said conventional electrostatic pinning procedure where the normal take up speed is 10 to 20 m min, is still applicable in the process of the invention. Thus, a take up speed of 100 to 200 m min or less may be adopted. On the contact of the extruded sheet to the surface of the moving chill body, the ratio of the natural flow rate of the extruded sheet to the surface moving rate of the moving chill body may be not less than 1.0, preferably from 1.0 to 120. According to the process of this invention, there can be manufactured a sheet of the polyamide material having an even thickness, a low crystallinity, a high transparency and a less irregularity in haze with a high speed. No stain due to oligomers is observed on the surface of the moving chill body. For manufacture of a drawn sheet or film of the polyamide material, the undrawn sheet as prepared above is drawn not less than I, folks preferably 1.1 to 8 folds, at least in a uniaxial directon. In close of Liaia dr ir., the undrawn sheet may be drawn 1.1 to 6 folds in etc of biaxial directions. Normally, the drawing in a machine direction MD is achieved by drawing the undrawn sheet using not less than two sets of rolls having different rotation speeds or using not less than one set of pressing rolls. The drawing in a transverse direction TD is accomplished in a tenter.The once uniaxially drawn film may be further drawn in the same or different direction.Alternatively, biaxial drawing may be effected simultaneously. In case of simultaneous multi axial drawing, the drawing may be effected in a tenter for simultaneous biaxial drawing or by shaping in a mold. The temperature for drawing may be usually from a temperature of Tg 100C to a temperature of M.P. 100C , preferably from a temperature of Tg 5 C to a temperature of M.P. 200C . Tg is a glass transition point, and NP. is a melting point . The drawing speed may be usually not less than 100 min, preferably from 300 to 2,000,000 min. The thickness of the drawn sheet is not limitative and may be usually not less than 2 microns. When the undrawn sheet obtained by the process of the invention is drawn as above, there is obtained a drawn sheet of the polyamide material having an even thickness and a high transparency. It is particularly notable that sequential biaxial stretching, which has been carried out only with great difficulty, can be successfully accomplished without any difficulty. Explaining a typical example of the process of the invention with reference to Fig. 2 of the accompanying drawings. the polyamide material in a melt state is extruded through a die 1 to give a sheet 2, which is quenched on the surface of a chill drum 3. A direct current of high voltage from an electric source 6 is applied to an electrode 7, from which discharge in a streamer corona state 8 is produced onto the sheet 2. The chilled undrawn sheet 5 goes over a roll 4 to a drawing apparatus 9 and then to another drawing apparatus 10. Finally, the drawn sheet is taken up in a take up apparatus 11. Practical and p resenoly preferred embediments o the present invention are shown in the following Zxamples wherein measurement of the physical properties was carried out in the following manner 1 Haze determined according to the method ns described in ASTM American Society for Testing and Materials D1003 61. 2 Variation in thickness determined by measuring the maximum and minimum thicknesses in the 5 m length of the machine direction using a thickness measuring apparatus of continuous contact type manufactured byAnritsu Denki K.K. and calculating the variation rate according to the following equation Variation in thickness EMI12.1 3 Specific gravity determined according to the method as described in ASTM D1505 63T. 4 Crystallinity determined by the calculation according to the following equation EMI12.2 wherein d is the density of the tested film g cm3 , da is the density of the non crystalline portion da of nylon 6, 1.113 da of nylon 66, 1.09 , dc is the density of the crystalline portion dc of nylon 6, 1.212 dc of nylon 66, 1.24 and alpha is the crystallinity. Example 1 In a per se conventional procedure, e caprolactam was subjected to polymerization, whereby nylon 6 Tc 185 C having a relative viscosity of 2.80 determined in sulfuric acid at 250C was p oduced. During the polymeri ration, silicon dioxide having an average particle size of 3 microns as a lubricant was added to the reaction system in an amount of 0.2 by weight to the weight of s caprolactam. The reaction mixture was dried at 1000C in vacuo to adjust to a water content of 0.10 by weight, melted at 2650C in a screw extruder of 90 mm and extruded through a die of 600 mm in width. On preparation of a sheet by the use of an apparatus as shown in Fig. 2, the extruded product was quenched on a chill roll of 300C and taken up at a take up speed of 30 m min. The obtained sheet had a thickness of about 200 microns. For comparison, a sheet of 200 microns thick was prepared without application of any electric load. Another sheet of 200 microns thick was also prepared by a conventional electrostatic pinning procedure. An electric source having a ripple of not more than 0.5 was used as a direct current high voltage electric source.
