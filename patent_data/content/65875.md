# Method and apparatus for applying a band of liquid adhesive.

## Abstract
The adhesive is spread by an applicator head 15 having a resiliently flexible tapering applicator portion having an adhesive buiding surface 17 which extends to a narrow terminal spreading surface 16 , the adhesive buiding sur face 16 being concave about an axis which extends transversely of the spreading surface 16 . The spreading surface 16 is brought into contact with a workpiece, a pool of adhesive from an orifice 18 in the adhesive guiding surface 17 is formed against the spreading surface 16 , the applicator portion is caused to flex so that a portion of the adhesive guiding surface 17 extends along the workpiece surface S , and relative movement between the workpiece W and the applicator head 15 is brought about so that the adhesive is spread. An apparatus for use in applying a band of liquid adhesive is also claimed.
