# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RESPIRATION MONITORING WITH AN NMR SCANNER

## Abstract
A method for eliminating or reducing breathing artifacts due to motion induced phase and amplitude errors in the phase encoding dimension when using Fourier transform im aging methods, such as spin warp, utilizes a repetition time TR which is an odd multiple of one quarter of the breathing cycle in the preferred embodiment, method and apparatus are provided for determining the breathing cycle by monitoring the integrated spin echo signal magnitude spectrum as a function of time.
