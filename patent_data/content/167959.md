# Computer vector register processing.

## Abstract
The movement of a set of element data in a computer is achieved by means of a plurality of vector registers 100, 101 and a moving unit which can move a set of element data from one vector register 100 to another register 101 in response to one instruction without going through either main memory or the functional units. A selector 200 responds to the instruction to route the output from one register 100 to the input of another and to also provide the appropriate read and write starting addresses.
