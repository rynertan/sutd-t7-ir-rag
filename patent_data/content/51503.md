# HIGH FREQUENCY BREATHING SYSTEM

## Abstract
Breathing mixture from a high pressure source 11 is supplied to a patient by a high frequency oscillatory system controlled by a circuit 41 operating a solenoid valve 43. The high pressure mixture is alternately supplied to inlets A of cylinders 45 and 49 and to the inlets B to drive the diaphragms 67 and 71 simultaneously up and then down. As 71 rises it closes valve 21 and forces low pressure mixture through valve 25 to the patient. At the same time 67 is rising, holding 31 closed and exhausting expired air through restrictor 35 against pressure developed by jet 39. When diaphragms 67 and 71 fall a fresh supply of mixture is drawn from the bag 19 while 25 is closed and 31 is opened to withdraw expired air.
