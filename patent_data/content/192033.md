## Description
Vaccines utilizing purified and unpurified preparations of intact The nature of the major outer membrane protein and its relation to the biovars and serovars of Polypeptide compositions having immunological activity corresponding to that of a major outer membrane protein MOMP of Methods and compositions as defined in the claims are provided for the efficient expression of polypeptides demonstrating immunological activity analogous to that of a major outer membrane protein MOMP of The MOMP polynucleotides of the present invention may be initially derived from any of the chlamydial serovars and may be employed in a natural or modified form. MOMP nucleotides having a sequence corresponding to an intact natural MOMP gene will usually be employed when it is desired to express the entire MOMP, although it will be possible to alter the sequence for a desired purpose, e.g., to conform to the codon bias of the expression host as discussed below , or to create or delete restriction sites, so long as the amino acid sequence is not significantly altered. Shorter DNA sequences corresponding to portions of the MOMP gene will be employed when it is desired to produce only a fragment of the natural proteins. Usually, such sequences will encode for an epitopic region s , comprising at least 27 bp, usually at least 36 bp, preferably at least 45 bp, and may be much longer. It will sometimes be desirable to express the MOMP polynucleotide together with other gene s in order to provide fused translation products having desirable properties. For example, when producing low molecular weight MOMP polypeptide fragments below about 5kD , it may be desirable to fuse the MOMP polypeptide to an immunogenic carrier, e.g., tetanus toxoid or hepatitis B surface antigen. It is also possible to fuse MOMP fragments from more than one serovar to each other and or a gene expressing a suitable immunogenic carrier. Conveniently, the MOMP polynucleotide will be inserted in proper reading frame with the fused gene and under the regulatory control of the regulatory system of the fused gene. Recovery of the gene product may be facilitated by employing a secretory protein as the fused gene product, as described below. The MOMP polypeptides may be glycosylated, partially glycosylated, or unglycosylated, depending on the nature of the expression host. Generally, prokaryotes such as The MOMP polynucleotide may be synthetic or natural, or combinations thereof. A natural MOMP gene or a portion thereof may be obtained by preparing a Synthetic polynucleotide sequences encoding for at least a portion of the MOMP gene of A number of techniques are available for synthesizing short, single stranded DNA fragments, e.g., the phosphoramidite method described by Beaucage and Carruthers 1981 Tetrahedron Lett. 22 1859 1862. A particularly useful adaptation of the method of Beaucage and Carruthers is reported by Warner et al. 1984 DNA 3 401 411. Using the method of Urdea et al., single stranded DNA fragments having a length of up to 100 bases may be synthesized, and double stranded DNA fragments may be formed by annealing and ligating a plurality of single stranded fragments under appropriate conditions. Alternatively, the complementary strand may be added using DNA polymerase with an appropriate primer sequence. When preparing synthetic MOMP polynucleotides, it may sometimes be desirable to modify the natural nucleotide sequence. For example, it will often be preferred to use codons which are preferentially recognized by the desired host. When employing a yeast host, codons which appear at high frequency in the structural genes encoding the yeast glycolytic enzymes may be employed. In some instances, it may be desirable to further alter the nucleotide sequence to create or remove restriction sites to increase stability or to substitute one or more amino acids in the resulting polypeptide. Such changes may be made to enhance the immunogenicity of the polypeptide, facilitate conjugating the polypeptide to a carrier protein, or the like. It may also be desirable to add amino acids to the N terminus or C terminus of the polypeptide, where such additional amino acids provide for a desired result. To produce a desired MOMP polypeptide, the MOMP polynucleotides will be incorporated into DNA constructs capable of being introduced into a desired expression host, usually either a prokaryotic host or eukaryotic host, such as yeast. Such DNA constructs will include the MOMP polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide product, transcriptional and translational initiation regulatory sequences joined to the 5 end of the polynucleotide, and transcriptional and translational termination regulatory sequences joined to the 3 end of the polynucleotide. The DNA constructs will usually also include a replication system recognized by the expression host to allow for self replication, and will often include other functional sequences such as markers allowing for selection of transformed hosts, additional replication systems, secretory leader and processing signal sequences, and the like. The replication system, however, is not necessary since the DNA construct may allow for integration into the host genome. The transcriptional initiation regulatory sequences will include a promoter region recognized by the expression host. For The transcriptional termination regulatory sequence will include a terminator, preferably a terminator balanced with the promoter to provide proper transcription. Conveniently, the terminator which is naturally found with the promoter may be employed. In the exemplary embodiment described in the Experimental section hereinafter, the MOMP polynucleotide is inserted between the β galactosidase promoter and terminator within the β galactosidase structural gene so that a fusion product is formed. Enhanced yields of the polypeptides of the present invention may be obtained by employing DNA constructs which include a secretory leader and processing signal sequence to effect secretion of the gene product in yeast. The use of such secretory leader and processing signal sequences will be particularly effective with polypeptides below about 40 kilodaltons, more usually below about 30 kilodaltons, although it is expected that the system will function with polypeptides equal to the length of the whole MOMP, i.e., ranging from 38 to 45 kilodaltons. The secretory leader and processing signal sequences will normally be derived from naturally occurring DNA sequences in yeast which provide for secretion of a polypeptide. Such polypeptides which are naturally secreted by yeast include Polypeptides of the present invention may also be recovered intracellularly as follows. After the transformed cell culture has reached a high density, the cells will be separated, typically by centrifugation, lysed, and the MOMP polypeptides isolated and purified by various techniques, such as extraction, affinity chromatography, electrophoresis, dialysis, and combinations thereof. The MOMP polypeptides may also be prepared by conventional solid phase synthesis techniques, such as those described by Merrifield 1963 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85 2149 2156. Such solid phase techniques are suitable for preparation of polypeptide fragments of up to about 50 to 100 amino acids, or more. Generally, however, as the length of the polypeptide increases above 25 amino acids, the difficulty in the synthesis increases and the desirability of employing a solid phase synthesis technique diminishes. The polypeptides of the present invention, and fragments thereof, may be employed in a variety of ways. The polypeptides can be employed both as labelled and unlabelled reagents in various immunoassays, bioassays, and the like, for the detection of In preparing a vaccine, the polypeptides will normally be incorporated in a physiologically acceptable medium, such as water, physiological saline, phosphate buffered saline, and the like. The vaccine may be administered intravenously, intraarterially, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or the like. The amount of immunogen employed per dose will be about 5 to 10 micrograms, if liquid, in a volume of about 0.25 to 1 ml, and may be administered repeatedly at about 2 to 4 week intervals, usually not more than 2 or 3 times. The polynucleotides of the present invention may be employed as labelled polynucleotide probes suitable for screening biological samples for the presence of various strains of Suitable labels include radionuclides, heavy metals, organic ligands, and the like, which allow for detection in conventional assays. Biological samples will be prepared in a conventional manner, e.g., by lysing the The following experiments are offered by way of illustration, not by way of limitation. DNase, RNase, endonuclease restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, kinase, DNA Polymerase I, and Polyvalent antiserum to Chlamydial DNA was isolated from cell extracts of serovars L Lysogens were produced from selected λgt11 recombinants by infecting λgt11 L2 33 insert DNA was obtained from A library of chlamydial genomic DNA was produced in the bacteriophage lambda 1059 system, which cloning system was described by Karn et al. 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 5172 5176. DNA obtained from After plaque purification, the seven recombinants were tested with a pool of monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibody pool consisted of four antibodies 2C1, 2G1, 2H2, AE11 that each bind a mutually exclusive MOMP determinant Stephens et al. 1982 Immunoblot analysis of PAGE gels using polyvalent rabbit anti L DNA from the λgt11 L2 33 recombinant was isolated, labelled with Preparations of λgt11 L2 33 insert DNA were obtained from The approximately 1.1 kb insert DNA was sequenced by standard techniques, and the sequence is set forth in Appendix A. Lambda 1059 recombinants having 9.2 to 9.8 kb inserts that were shown to be homologous with λgt11 L2 33 by Southern analysis were used for endonuclease restriction mapping, and additional Southern analyses. Two contiguous fragments The sequence includes an untranslated region comprising 1287 bases, followed by a 66 base region encoding a 22 amino acid leader sequence. Coding for the MOMP begins at base 67 amino acid 23 and extends through base number 1182 amino acid 394 . The molecular weight for the MOMP including the leader is calculated to be 42,557 daltons. The N terminus of the MOMP was located on the basis of the 25 amino acid N terminus reported by Nano et al. 1985 The sequence set forth in Appendix A corresponds to amino acids 247 through the 3 terminus in Appendix B, with certain deviations. Bases 36 38 in Appendix A are AGA, corresponding to amino acids GlyGlu, while bases 773 775 in Appendix B are TGT, corresponding to amino acids GlyVal. These deviations are underlined in both Appendices. The DNA sequence corresponding to amino acids 305 through 394 in Appendix B has several deviations from Appendix A which result in a different reading frame for the sequence of Appendix B. Base numbers 174, 181, and 186 in Appendix A were not detected in the λ 1059 clones. Base number 35 in Appendix A is a T, while the corresponding base in Appendix B in amino acid 357 is a C. Finally, a G is inserted in amino acid 358 and a G is inserted in amino acid 374 in the sequence of Appendix B. In both Appendices A and B, bases which are inserted or changed relative to the other Appendix are boxed, while deleted bases are indicated by an arrow. Both the DNA and amino acid sequences of Appendix B are believed to be correct. According to the subject invention, novel recombinant DNA constructs are provided for the expression of a polypeptide having immunological activity corresponding to that of a naturally occurring major outer membrane protein of
