# Track controller for a document processor.

## Abstract
A controller monitors and controls the operation of the document transporting portions of a document processor. It employs sensors which detect the passage of the trailing edges of documents and timers which measure the time taken for a document to pass successive sensors. Whenever this time period is too long, the controller determines that the document being timed has jammed and provides signals to stop the operation of sections of the system in an orderly fashion designed to minimize the effects of jamming.
