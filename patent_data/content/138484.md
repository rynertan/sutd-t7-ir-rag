# MECHANICAL PULPING

## Abstract
Thermomechanical, chemimechanical, and chemithermo mechanical pulps are produced in a manner such that they have enhanced drainage and strength, and or can be bleached to en hanced brightness levels and in a simple manner. Chips are im pregnated with chemical or thermal treating fluid, such as by passing heated sulfite liquor countercurrent to the flow of the chips at 12 . After impregnation, and where applicable cook ing, the chips are washed by a countercurrent flow of wash liquid at 13, 27 including chelating and surface active agents. Immediately after washing the chips are mechanically refined to produce a mechanical pulp by passing the chips through a first pressurized refiner 14, 38 , screening at 15, 39 the pulp discharge from the first refiner to provide first 16, 40 and sec ond 17, 41 streams, passing the first stream to a second pres surized refiner 18, 43 having a discharge 19, 44 , and pass ing the second stream directly to the discharge of the second refiner. Further treatment of the pulp, including bleaching at 21, 57 utilizing hydrosulfite and or peroxide, is effected in order to achieve a mechanical pulp having the desired prop erties.
