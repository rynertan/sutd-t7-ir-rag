# Apparatus for distinguishing between speech and certain other signals.

## Abstract
Apparatus for distinguishing between speech and, for example, data and noise signals, for example for use in a non speech squelch circuit in a broadcast receiver, utilises the fact that an autocorrelogram of a speech signal exhibits peaks which wander backwards and forwards along the delay axis, this not being the case for autocorrelograms of most other signals. Autocorrelograms of an input signal applied to an input terminal 1 and hard limited by means of a comparator 5 are formed under the control of a computer 14 by means of a shift register 3 , a multiplexer 10 an inverting EXOR gate 7 , an up down counter 19 and a memory 41 . For each clock pulse fed to the clock input 30 of the shift register the output 11 of the multiplexer, and hence one input of the EXOR gate, is switched to each of a succession of taps 8 on the shift register. Thus the signal on the first tap 6 of the register is multiplied in succession by the signals on the other taps 8 and the results are used to increment or decrement corresponding quantities in the memory 41 by means of the up down counter 19 , Autocorrelograms relating to succes sive periods of time are formed in this way and the computer determines the positions of the peaks if any in each and by comparison of these positions determines whether they are stationary or wandering.
