## Abstract
The present invention provides expression of the S antigen of HBV in eucaryotic host cells, especially mammalian cells, whereby post translational processes sufficient for formation of S antigen aggregates occur, under conditions of minimum risk of contamination. The S antigen aggregates produced are highly antigenic, capable of eliciting protective immunity against HBV infection, hence suitable for incorporation into a vaccine. A significant contribution of the present invention is the use of the normal S antigen promoter of HBV, either alone or in tandem with a second promoter. The invention further provides a vector for HBV core antigen expression using the HBV core antigen promoter. The use of HBV core antigen promoter permits construction of an expression vector independent of any preexisting promoter of the vector. The core antigen promoter is also very active and will be useful for the construction of vectors for expression of other proteins.

## Description
VIRUS PROTEIN SYNTHESISBACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART The operations of recombinant DNA technology include the isolation and purification of DNA coding for a particular desired protein, the transfer of the desired DNA to a different host organism, the expression of the transferred DNA by the host organism resulting in synthesis of the desired protein, and the isolation and purification of the desired protein from the host organism. Transfer is accomplished by inserting the desired DNA into a transfer vector which is DNA, either of plasmid or viral origin, capable of autonomous replication in the chosen host. To date the major emphasis has been on the use of procaryotic, e.g., bacterial, hosts and transfer vectors therefor. Bacterial hosts have the advantage of rapid growth rate on inexpensive media on a large scale.They have the disadvantage that they lack the inherent capability to carry out certain aspects of post transcriptional and post translational processing required for the accurate expression of many eucaryotic genes. Eucaryotic genes frequently contain internal untranslated regions, termed introns, not found in procaryotes. Post transcriptional processing of RNA transcribed from a eucaryotic gene is performed in the nucleus of a eucaryotic cell, in a series of cutting and splicing steps, resulting in messengerRNA with contiguous coding segments. Procaryotic cells lack the ability to carry out the necessary splicing reactions. As a consequence, many eucaryotic genes cannot be directly transferred and expressed in a procaryotic host. The prior art has resorted to the expedient of cloning cDNA, a reverse transcript of messenger RNA isolated from the eucaryotic donor cell. The cDNA method is limited to circumstances where mRNA coding for the desired protein is the predominant mRNA isolated from the donor cells or can be differentially isolated by special techniques.In many instances, however, the direct isolation of the corresponding eucaryotic gene is the only practical alternative. Such genomic clones must be expressed in a eucaryotic.host cell. An additional disadvantage of procaryotic hosts is presented by their inability to carry out certain post translational processing steps. Such steps may include specific glycosylation and phosphorylation steps, the formation of specific disulfide crosslinks and the removal of certain peptides, for example. Eucaryotic host cells can normally carry out such steps, while the prior art reliance on procaryotic hosts necessitates resorting to in vitro chemical or enzymatic reactions which are difficult to control. Despite these difficulties, the use of eucaryotic host cells is preferred where posttranslational processing steps yield a more desirable product. For example, in the case of Hepatitis B virus HBV , a major antigen, the surface S antigen, is a primary factor in eliciting protective immunity against the virus. The S antigen is a component of the outer envelope of the virus. Plasma from persistently infected individuals also contains characteristic 22nm spherical particles which are aggregates of S antigen monomers, lipid and other proteins.About half of the S antigen molecules in the 22nm particles are glycosylated. Inasmuch as HBV cannot be grown in cultured cells or in laboratory animals, the only current source is from infected donor individuals. Purified 22nm particles have heen shown to elicit protective immunity upon administration to non immune volunteers. The lack of a convenient source of antigen particles limits their.usefulness as a vaccine for large scale immunization. The entire genome of HBV has been cloned inE. coli, and its nucleotide sequence determined. The amino acid sequences of the surface and core antigens have been inferred from the nucleotide sequences of HBV DNA. However, the nucleotide sequence data do not permit a prediction of the function of untranslated regions, or the existence of translated but subsequently processed regions, such as signal peptides. The location of a promoter sequence for a given eucaryotic gene is unpredictable however, a See copending application Ser. No. 107,767, incorporated herein by reference. promoter will frequently include a sequence resembling the Hogness box , TATAA, 21 to 32 base pairs upstream from the start of the coding region. See Corden,J., et al, Science, 209, 1406 1980 . In the case of HBV S antigen, such a region was not identified near the start of the region coding for matureS antigen. Both monomeric S antigen and the core antigen of HBV have been synthesized by bacteria containing the respective coding regions of HBV DNA on a suitable transfer vector. Expression by procaryotic hosts results in production of non glycosylated, monomeric S antigen either directly or as a fusion protein having a procaryoticNH2 terminal portion. See Application Ser. No. 107,267. The procaryotic expression products are antigenic, but to a lesser extent than the 22nm particles. A desired goal would be the application of recombinant DNA techniques to achieve expression of S antigen in a eucaryotic host, in which the post translational processes yielding 22nm particles or other S antigen aggregates could occur. Such expression has reportedly been achieved, in monkey cells, using an S antigen coding region inserted. into SV 40, expressed under control of the SV 40 late promoter. At least some of the S antigen expressed under these conditions was in the form ofS antgen aggregates visible in the electron microscope, indicating that the requisite posttranslational processes could occur during expression in monkey cells. SV 40 can infect human cells and is capable of causing tumor transformation.Therefore, the SV 40 system is disadvantageous for the purpose Hamer, D., First International Congress for Recombinant DNA Research 1981 . of making a vaccine because of the risk of virus contamination of extracts of SV 40 infected cells.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides expression of the S antigen of HBV in eucaryotic host cells, especially mammalian cells, whereby post translational processes sufficient for formation of S antigen aggregates occur, under conditions of minimum risk of contamination. The S antigen aggregates produced are highly antigenic, capable of eliciting protective immunity against HBV infection, hence suitable for incorporation into a vaccine. A significant contribution of the present invention is the use of the normal S antigen promoter of HBV, either alone or in tandem with a second promoter. Expression ofS antigen may thereby be achieved in a variety of vectors, independent of the existance or orientation of other promoters of the vector. The S antigen promoter is highly active and should prove useful by itself, for enhancing the expression of other genes in eucaryotic host. As a further aspect of the invention, synthesis of S antigen is enhanced by the use of the S antigen promoter in tandem with, and in the same orientation as, a second promoter. The invention therefore provides a novel and unobvious expression vector for synthesis of S antigen in eucaryotic host cells and for the production ofS antigen aggregates. The S antigen aggregates provide a more highly antigenic form of S antigen than that produced by bacterial hosts. The invention provides a vaccine comprising the S antigen aggregates produced according to the invention, or using the expression vector of the invention. The invention further provides a vector forHBV core antigen expression using the HBV coreantigen promoter. The use of HBV core antigen promoter permits construction of an expression vector independent of any pre existing promoter of the vector. The core antigen promoter is also very active and will be useful for the construction of vectors for expression of other proteins.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The starting point in the present invention is cloned HBV DNA, carried on a plasmid transfer vector, such as pBR325, maintained and replicated in a strain of E. coli. Knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the cloned HBV genome, which totals 3221 base pairs, allows for determining the relative location of the three major viral proteins, surface antigen, core protein and DNA polymerase, predicting their amino acid sequences and locating the sites of action of various restriction endonucleases. The HBV DNA nucleotide sequence may also provide information as to the location of TATAA like sequences usually associated at sites of initiation of transcription. However, to unequivocally locate and identify a promoter sequence, it is necessary to carry out in vitro experiments.The general strategy employed herein was to use HBV DNA, cut at various points by a restriction endonuclease, as a template for in vitro transcription. The greater the template length between the initiation point promoter and the restriction endonuclease cleavage site, the longer the RNA product. In order to provide a as set forth in application Ser. No. 107,267 meaningful reflection of eucaryotic transcription, an in vivo system extracted from eucaryotic cells should verbar be employed. RNA polymerase IT is the enzyme responsible for mRNA production in mammalian cells.The length of the RNA product can be measured by gel electrophoresis, which separates nucleic acids on the basis of their length. The amount of RNA synthesized can be determined by measuring the incorporation of a radio labelled precursor of known specific activity into the RNA product.. Once the promoter has been identified, the next step is to construct an expression vector for expression of a coding region. Having demonstrated herein the activity of the HBV S antigen and core protein promoters, it will be understood that these same promoters are useful for directing expression of other coding regions as well. Indeed, the high level of activity of the HBV promoters suggests their use in a wide variety of expression systems, where high levels of expression are desired. An expression vector suitable for eucaryotic cells must be capable of replication in the host cell, in addition to providing a suitably located restriction site for inserting the promoter and coding region. Preferably, the vector itself should not be responsible for production of toxic substances, since it would be desirable to use the desired expression products for human administration, e.g., as a vaccine. However, the utility of HBV antigens is not limited to direct administration to produce active immunity. The antigens are also useful to produce corresponding antibodies in animals, and such antibodies are useful in diagnostic testing and for providing passive immunity. The antigens are also useful to produce monoclonal antibodies. For the purpose of demonstrating HBV Santigen expression in a eucaryotic cell, an expression vector based on the virus SV 40 was employed. The advantageous features of SV 40 include the fact that it is a well characterized virus it has an active promoter, the late promoter, of its own and its replication in the host cell provides an enormous gene amplification, up to 100,000 copies per cell late in the infection cycle. AS a system for demonstrating the practicality of the invention,SV 40 provides ease of manipulation, high levels of expression and a means for exploring the effects of promoters in tandem. For producing S antigen for use in a vaccine, SV 40 has the disadvantage of being a virus capable of infecting human cells and of producing tumor transformation.It will be understood that other eucaryotic vector systems, for example adenovirus, are to be preferred where the expression product must be administered to human beings. Another suitable system employs COS cells bearing an integrated SV 40 genome and producing the large T antigen required for SV 40 replication Gluzman, Y., Cell, 23, 175 1981 . Such host cells are able to replicate any vector carrying an SV 40 replication origin region. Such vectors may be made defective in SV 40 late functions, by deletion or insertion of heterologous sequences. Such vectors are able to replicate in os host cells, and to express the genes which they bear, without See, generally, Tooze, J. 1980 in DNA Tumor Viruses J. Tooze, Ed. , cold Spring Harbor laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., part 2, pp. 175 204. concomitant production of virus particles or infective viral DNA. The SV 40 vectors disclosed herein demonstrate the effects of using an HBV promoter in tandem with and in opposition to the endogeneous SV 40 late promoter. Expression of HBV S antigen and core protein were both demonstrated in host cells having the SV 40 vector with the late promoter oriented away from opposite to the HBV promoter herein designated pESV HVS . Therefore, substantial expression was obtained from the HBV promoter alone.Some stimulation of expression was observed when the vector was constructed with the SV 40 and HBV promoters oriented in the same direction in tandem , herein designated pESV HVS . Therefore the use of an HBV promoter in tandem with a vector promoter may enhance the yield of expression product. The relationship of the HBV S antigen promoter to the coding region of mature S antigen is most unusual. The experimentally identified promoter lies 592 base pairs upstream from the codon for theNH2 terminal amino acid of mature S antigen, whereas TATAA like sequences are usually found 21 to 32 base pairs upstream Corden, J., et al, Science, 209, 1406 1980 . If mature S antigen is in fact the initial translation product, the large distance from the promoter to the start codon may have special significance in the control of S antigen expression.However, a long region free of in phase stop codons precedes the start of the region coding for matureS antigen. Furthermore, a methionine start codon exists in this preceding region only 70 base pairs downstream from the S antigen promoter. It is entirely likely, as an alternative, that the initial translation product from the S antigen promoter is a much larger protein, comprising mature S antigen and a pre sequence, which may have an important function in the assembly of S antigen aggregates such as the 22nm S antigen particles. In either case, the use of the normal S antigen promoter in its normal relationship to the mature S antigen coding region is considered to contribute to efficient expression ofS antigen aggregates, and may serve to explain the unexpected advantages of the invention. As an alternative embodiment of the invention, the HBV region lying between the matureS antigen and its promoter is deleted, effectively moving the promoter nearer the start codon of the mature S antigen coding region. At this point, the existence of introns in the deleted region cannot be ruled out. Consequently, the alternative embodiment may be advantageous in certain vectors, e.g., yeasts, which do not carry out post transcriptional processing. Because of their high activity, the HBV promoters are useful for high rates of expression of a variety of proteins in eucaryotic hosts. The present invention contemplates a eucaryotic expression vector comprising an HBV promoter. TheHBV promoter may be alone or placed in tandem with one or more additional eucaryotic promoters to modify the rate of expression of a coding region downstream therefrom. Proteins such as HBV S antigen and HBV core protein are synthesized by host cells containing the described vector. Other proteins, especially proteins whose synthesis in mature form entails posttranslational processing steps, are similarly synthesized using a vector of the present invention. The following examples demonstrate identifi cation of the HBV promoters, the construction of a suitable vector comprising an HBV promoter, synthesis of a protein under HBV promoter control, and production of a hepatitis vaccine comprising S antigen synthesized under HBV promoter control in a eucaryotic host cell. EXAMPLE 1 Identification of HBV promoters.Transcription of HBV DNA was carried out in an in vitro system, using cell free extracts of HeLa S3 cells, as described by Manley, J. L., et al, Proc.Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 77, 3855 1980 . DNA used as template in the reactions was derived from either plasmid pBam 1.85 or pEco 63. The former is pBR322 having the larger of two possible BamHI fragments ofHBV inserted in the BamHI site, spanning the region from about 1.4 to 0.2 on the HBV map see Figure 1 .The latter is pBR325 having the entire HBV genome, cleaved at the EcoRI site, inserted in the EcoRI site of the plasmid. Construction of both plasmids is described in detail in copending application Ser. No.107,267 incorporated herein by reference. PlasmidDNA was purified from extracts of transformed cells by standard methods, for example as described byBolivar, R., et al, Methods in Enzymology R. Wu, End. , Vol. 68, p. 245, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. 1979 and by Kahn, M., et al, Ibid., p. 268. DNA of pBam 1.85 was further treated by digestion with a restriction endonuclease, as described infra and used without further purification in the transcription reaction. DNA of pEco 63 was digested with EcoRI endonuclease to release the full sized HBV DNA insert. The insert was separated by preparative gel electrophoresis and electroeluted from the gel, using standard techniques for example as described byBolivar, F., supra, or by Southern, E., Ibid., p. 152. To determine the start site of mRNA coding for the HBV core protein, the following DNA templates were tested pBam 1.85 cleaved by HinclI at base 1685, according to the system of numbering HBV bases from the EcoRI site pBam 1.85 cleaved by BstEII at base 2824 pBam 1.85 cleaved by Bal I at base 3010 and HBV DNA cleaved by EcoRI at base 1 . In comparing sequence numbers with those disclosed in copending application Serial No. 107,267, note that the starting point for numbering the bases was not the same. Thus, in the instant case, base number 1 corresponds to base number 1408 in application Serial NO. 107,267 . Approximate map locations can be seen by reference to Figure 1. In the case of the core protein gene, a possible Hogness box was identified at base 1654, approximately located by a triangle in Figure 1.Using the previously described restrictionendonuclease cut template DNA, transcription initiated near base 1654 would yield RNA products of the following expected sizes HincII 3 bases BstEII 1142 bases BalI 1328 bases EcoRI 1539 bases The in vitro transcription reactions were carried out as described by Manley, J. L., et al, supra. The reaction mixture contained commat 32P GTP, 400 Ci mole ATP, CTP and TTP, HeLa Cell S3 extract containing RNA polymerase II and HBV templateDNA. After incubation for 60 minutes at 300C, theRNA product was extracted from the reaction mixture with phenol chloroform, ethanol precipitated, redissolved and anlyzed by electrophoresis on a 5 acrylamide urea gel, as described by Maxam, A., et al, Methods in Enzymology, Vol, 65 L.Grossman andK. Moldane, Eds. , p. 499. The gels resolved RNA molecules ranging in length from about 50 to 1500 bases. RNA transcripts were found to have the following sizes, using the indicated template DNA Hincil not detected BstEII 1100 bases BalI 1350 bases EcoRI 1600 basesThe results indicate initiation of mRNA synthesis near the Hogness box beginning at base 1654. The nucleotide sequence of HBV DNA from base 1652 isTACATAAG. The S antigen promoter was determined experimentally by a similar series of in vitro transcription experiments. A possible Hogness box sequence at base 2785 was noted, although it lies far upstream from the start of the mature S antigen coding region. Template DNA used for these experiments was pBam 1.85 cleaved by BstEII endonuclease base 2824 , pBam 1.85 cleaved by BalI endonuclease base 3010 , pBam 1.85 cleaved by HincII endonuclease base 3210 , HBV DNA cleaved by EcoRI base 1 and pBam 1.85 cleaved by BamHI endonuclease base 31 . Transcription initiated near base 2785 would yield RNA products of the following expected sizes using template DNA cleaved by the indicated restriction endonuclease BstEII 8 bases BalI 194 bases HincII 304 bases EcoRI 405 bases BamHI 436 bases In vitro reactions were carried out as described for the core protein.The resulting RNA transcripts were of the following observed sizes, using DNA cleaved by the indicated restriction endonuclease BstEII Not Detected BalI 200 bases HincII 310 bases EcoRI 410 bases BamHI 440 basesThe data for BstEII cleaved DNA was confirmed usingBstEII cleaved HBV DNA purified from pEco 63.Additional RNA bands of 460 and 490 bases were observed with EcoRI and BamHI treated DNA, respectively. The results confirm the location of the S antigen promoter near base 2785. The HBV DNA nucleotide sequence from base 2783 is TATATAA. The actual initiation site of mRNA synthesis may be located about 60 bases upstream of that originally predicted, however, the location of the promoter is clearly identified by these experiments. The amount of RNA formed under control of either HBV promoter was compared to the amount synthesized in the same system under control of the adenovirus late promoter, a known highly active promoter. The amount of a 32P GTP incorporated into RNA was estimated by the density of autoradiograms of the gel electrophoresis plates. TheHBV promoters resulted in comparable incorporation of radioactivity to the adenovirus promoter. Hence, theHBV promoters are themselves highly active in promoting synthesis of mRNA. EXAMPLE 2 Construction of expression vectors comprising an HBV promoter. In the following.experiments, all restriction enzyme digestions were carried out under conditions recommended by the manufacturer, New England BioLabs, Beverly,Massachusetts. Units of restriction endonuclease activity are herein defined as an amount of enzyme needed to completely hydrolyze all susceptible sites in 1 ug of DNA in one hour at 370C. For complete digestions, reaction mixtures contained 1 unit enzyme per ijg DNA. For partial digestions with HpaI, 0.25 units ug DNA was employed, and for partial digestion with BamHI, 0.5 units pg DNA was employed. All batches of enzyme were individually assayed to calibrate their activity. Ligation reactions, catalyzed by DNA ligase, were carried out by standard methods, e.g., as described by Bolivar, F., et al, supra.The sequence of vector construction steps is diagrammed in Figure 2. Two vectors were constructed using the HBV S antigen promoter, one having the HBV promoter in tandem with the SV 40 late promoter, the other having the two promoters in opposite orientation. The former was designated pESV HVS , the latter pESV HVS For the purpose of both constructions, 20 vq pEco 63 was cleaved with BglII and HpaI endonuclease.A large fragment containing pBR325 and HBV sequences including S antigen coding region was purified by preparative gel electrophoresis, essentially as described, supra. For construction of pESV HVS , 20 ug ofSV 40 DNA was partially digested with HpaI endonuclease, then digested with BamHI endonuclease.The desired product, spanning from the HpaI site at 0.76 on the SV 40 map to the BamHI site at 0.14, was purified by preparative gel electrophoresis. The resulting SV 40 and pEco 63 fragments were recombined in a DNA ligase catalyzed reaction.The BamHI and BglII generated ends of the respective plasmids are single stranded and self complementary, hence cohesive, and join specifically together. For a description of restriction endonucleases, seeRoberts, R., Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 68 R. Wu, Ed. , p. 27. The HpaI generated ends are blunt.Consequently the two fragments cannot self ligate, and only recombine in one orientation with respect to each other. The recombinant pEco 63 SV 40 plasmid was used to transform an ampicillin sensitive E. coli strain by standard transformation techniques, e.g., as described by Bolivar, et al, supra. Approximately 100 ampicillin resistant colonies were obtained from 1 trg of recombinant pEco 63 SV 40 DNA. The colonies were then tested by in situ hybridization, essentially as described by Grunstein, M., et al, Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 68 R. Wu, Ed. , p. 379, usingSV 40 DNA as a probe. Approximately 25 colonies contained SV 40 sequences, and plasmid DNA was isolated from several of these for further testing by restriction endonuclease cleavage and gel electrophoresis to determine the presence of fragments of predicted size and number. About 50 of these isolates proved satisfactory. A selected pEco 63 SV 40 recombinant plasmidwas purified and digested with EcoRI endonuclease to remove the pBR325 DNA. The product was then slf ligated. This step resulted in restoration of an uninterrupted S antigen coding region, as shown inFigure 2. The HBV promoter and the SV 40 promoter were in opposite orientation. The resulting vector was designated pESV HVS The pESV HVS vector was used to cotransfect monkey CV 1 cells, together with DNA of a replication deficient SV 40 mutant. Either a thermosensitive mutant tsA58 or a deletion mutant tsAd was employed, the latter being preferred.Productive infection could occur only in CV 1 cells transfected with both DNAs cotransfected .Virus stocks were prepared from single plaque isolates of cotransfected cells. The stocks were mixtures of SV 40 pESV HVS and SV 40tsAt orSV 40tsA58 depending on the helper virus employed . The composition of the virus stocks was verified by the Southern hybridization technique Southern, E. M., J. Mol. Biol., 98, 503 1975 . Growth and transfection are described, e.g., by Myers, R. M., et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 77, 6491 1980 . Six days after co infection with a virus stock prepared as described, free DNA was extracted from infected cells by the method of Hirt, B., J. Mol.Biol., 98, 503 1967 . The DNA was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.4 agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters as described by Southern,E. M., supra. Hybridization to 32P labelled HBV DNA or SV 40 DNA revealed the positions of SV 40 and HBVDNA sequences after electrophoresis. With the SV 40 probe, two DNA bands were found, that of the tsAA or tsA58 helper and that of the recombinantESV HVS . The HBV DNA probe hybridized exclusively to the recombinant DNA band. The experiment proved the existence of two distinct virus types in the stock, helper and recombinant. Construction of pESV HVS . For this construction, pEco 63 cleaved with BglII and HpaI endonucleases, described supra, was employed. SV 40DNA, 20 iig, was digested with HpaII endonuclease to cleave the DNA at 0.72 on the SV 40 map. The linearDNA was then treated with S1 nuclease and DNA polymerase I to produce blunt ends, as described, for example, by Bolivar, F., et al, supra. The blunt ends were next attached to synthetic BamHI oligonucleotide linkers see Rothstein, R. J., et al,Methods of Enzymology, Vol. 68 R. Wu, Ed. , p. 98 , commercially available from Collaborative Research,Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, by a standard technique, as described, e.g., by Goodman, H. M., et al, Ibid., p. 75. The linear DNA was then partially digested by HpaI endonuclease, followed by BamHI endonuclease digestion. The desired fragment of 2.8 kb, from the HpaII site at 0.72 map units to the HpaI site at 0.17 map units, was purified by gel electro phoresis and recombined with BglII HpaI cleaved pEco 63, as described, supra. Selection of ampicillin resistant transformants and characterization of the recombinant plasmids was carried out as described, supra. The pEco 63 SV 40 recombinant plasmid thereby obtained was treated with EcoRI endonuclease to remove the pBR325 sequences and to reconstitute theHBV S antigen gene. The resulting vector, designated pESV HVS , had the SV 40 late promoter oriented in tandem with the HBV S antigen promoter, as diagrammed in Figure 2. Virus stocks comprising SV 40 pESV HVS were propagated by cotransfection with helper DNA or by coinfection with helper virus, as described, supra. Construction of vectors containing the HBV core protein promoter. The general strategy for construction of SV 40 vectors having tandem and opposite orientation of the SV 40 and core protein promoters is diagrammed in Figure 3. The techniques and procedures employed were esséntially those already described. SV 40 DNA was cleaved with restriction endonuclease HaeII at map unit 0.82. The linear DNA was treated with S1 nuclease and DNA polymerase I to provide blunt ends to which synthetic BamHI oligonucleotide linkers were attached by ligation.The DNA was then cleaved with BamHI endonuclease at map unit 0.14 to produce a large fragment spanning 0.14 to 0.82 purified by gel electrophoresis. The fragment was then inserted at the BamHI site of plasmid pBR322. The resulting recombinant was designated E SV, and contained the origin of SV 4 replication and a functional A gene required for SV 40 replication . A BamHI fragment, purified from pEco 63, was inserted into the BamHI site of pBR322.Two BamHI fragments were generated by cleavage of pEco 63. The larger fragment, containing the core protein gene and a short seqment of pBR322, was purified by preparative gel electrophoresis before insertion into the BamHI site of pBR322. The resulting recombinant was designated F HVC. The plasmids E SV and E HVC were prepared on a large scale 20 yg each . The plasmids were each treated with BamHI to release the SV 40 and HBV sequences, respectively. The respective sequences were then recombined with each other, in a DNA liqase catalyzed reaction. The two possible orientations for the HBV sequence relative to the SV 40 sequence yielded two recombinants, ESV HVC and ESV HVC , having theSV 40 promoter oriented in opposition and in tandem, respectively, with the HBV core protein promoter.Virus stocks were prepared and characterized as described, supra. ESV HVC and ESV HVC were distinguished by cleavage with restriction endonucleases having asymetrically located sites in theSV 40 and HBV sequences, so as to generate a unique set of restriction fragments from each vector recognizable by gel electrophoresis. EXAMPLE 3 Expression of HBV genes in SV 40 vectors.Synthesis of HBV mRNA was tested using all four SV 40HBV recombinant viruses SV 40 pESV HVS , SV 40 pESV HVS , SV 40 pESV HVC and SV 40 pESV HVC . Monkey CV 1 cells were infected with one of the above viruses mixed with SV 40 tsA58 as helper. After six days at 400C, cytoplasmic RNA was isolated, denatured and fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.5 agarose methyl mercury gel and transferred to diazotized benzyloxymethyl paper for hybridization to radio labelled probe DNA, as described by Alwine, J, C., et al, Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 68 R. Wu, Ed. , p. 220.The RNA was hybridized with nick translated 32p labelled HBV DNA or SV 40 DNA, to reveal the position of SV 40 and HBV RNA s in the gel, by autoradiography. With the SV 40 probe, two RNA bands were visible, corresponding to 19S and 16S SV 40 mRNA. The HBV probe detected at least two mRNAs, one of which was the core gene transcript and one the S antigen transcript.Synthesis of S antigen and core protein is detected in monkeyCV l cells infected with each one of the four recombinant viruses, labelled for six 35 hours with 35S cysteine. The S antigen and core protein are immunoprecipitated from the cellular protein fraction and from the medium, with specific antibody to S antigen and core protein, respectively, using formaldehyde treated Staphylococcus aureus C to collect the antigen antigody complexes, as described by Martial, J. A., et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 74, 1816 1977 . S antigen is detected both in infected cells and in the medium. Significantly,S antigen is detected in cells infected with SV 40 ESV HVS , where the SV 40 promoter has opposite orientation from the HBV promoter.Therefore, expression of S antigen is controlled entirely by theHBV S antigen promoter in this instance. Core protein is detected primarily in the cellular protein fraction. Expression of core protein is observed in cells infected with SV 40 ESV HVC where theSV 40 promoter has opposite orientation from the HBV core protein promoter. Therefore, expression of core protein is controlled by the HBV core protein promoter in this instance. Preparations of S antigen partially purified from SV 40 ESV HSV infected cells are concentrated and prepared fdr electron microscopy seeSkelly, J., et al, J. Gen. Virol., 44, 679 1979 .Aggregates and particles resembling 22nm S antiqen particles are observed in the electron microscope field. Such aggregates are not observed from control cultures infected with helper virus only. EXAMPLE 4 Preparation of a vaccine comprisingS antigen. Preferred vectors for synthesis ofS antigen for vaccine purposes are those which do not produce toxic or tumorigenic substances. Such vectors include adenoviruses, and various SV 40 systems that fail to make virus particles. For example, the recombinant vector pSV0l, described byMyers, R. M., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 77, 6491 1980 , contains a 311 bp fragment including theSV 40 origin of DNA replication, the early promoter and the T antigen binding site, inserted in pBR322.The vector replicates in transfected monkey COS l cells which contain integrated SV 40 and express T antigen Gluzman, Y., Cell, 23, 175 1981 .Recombinants of pSV0l and HBV DNA, containing the S antigen promoter and coding region, provide a suitable vector for synthesis of S antigen in COS 1 cells. S antigen particles are purified from cell extracts by standard methods, for example as described by Skelly, J., et al, supra. PurifiedS antigen aggregates and 22nm particles are dialyzed against physiological saline or phosphate buffered saline and adjusted to 200 ijg protein ml final concentration. Guinea pigs are injected subcutaneously at 9, 14 and 56 day intervals with 1 ml of theS antigen preparation. The serum of the test animals is sampled at 0, 28, 56 and 84 days and assayed for antibody titre against Dane particles or S antigen partially purified from infectious serum. The radioimmunoassay of Hollinger, F., et al, J. Immunol., 107, 1099 1971 is employed. The majority of animals exhibit antibodies cross reactive withS antigen 84 days after administration of the protein. Similar results are obtained upon injection of monkeys. Accordingly, the immunologically active protein constituents of HBV, expressed by a eucaryotic cell that has been transformed by an expression vector encoding said protein and the HBV promoter thereof, are capable of eliciting antibodies cross reactive with known immunologically reactive components of HBV. The described proteins have the advantage of being available in significantly larger quantities than S antigen obtained from Dane particles or carrier serum. Furthermore, there is no danger of accidental infection since there is no intact virus in the S antigen expression product. By contrast, viral proteins purified from serum always pose the danger of viral contamination. EXAMPLE 5 As shown in Example 4, protein coded by theHBV genome and synthesized by a eucaryotic cell is capable of eliciting antibodies cross reactive withHBV S antigen and core protein. It therefore follows that such antigens and antigen aggregates, when purified as described and administered in a physiologically acceptable medium, constitute a vaccine for protection against infection by the virus. Sixteen chimpanzees are divided into three groups. Group A 6 animals is inoculated intravenously with 1.0 ml of B.O.B. Hepatitis B virus Group B 4 animals is inoculated intravenously with 1.0 ml containing 500 Vg ofS antigen, synthesized and purified as described inExample 3 or 4, in physiological saline Group C 6 animals is the control group and receives no inoculation. All chimpanzees in Group A have evidence of clinical hepatitis B either antigenemia, enzyme elevations and or antibody response within forty weeks. None of the animals in Groups B or C show evidence of clinical hepatitis B infection over the same 40 week period. The chimpanzees of Group B are rendered immune to subsequent challenge when inoculated intravenously with 1.0 ml of B.O.B. Hepatitis B virus.
