## Description
The present invention relates generally to improved processes for free radical polymerization, particularly to improved processes in which it is possible to control the growth steps of the polymerization to produce relatively short chain length homopolymers and copolymers, including block and graft copolymers, and further relates to new initiators which find particular application in the improved processes. Polymers having relatively low molecular weight short chain lengths , which are often referred to as oligomers, have recently become of increasing interest since such polymers have been found to be useful in a variety of products, such as for example, in the production of surface coatings, such as high solids or solvent free surface coatings, in adhesives, as plasticizers in polymeric compositions, and as reactive intermediates for the production of a wide variety of other materials such as for example surface active agents. While various alkyds, polyesters, polyethers, polyamides and polyurethanes having molecular weights in the range 500 to 2500 can be conveniently prepared in general by step growth polymerization, it has not been possible to produce similarly sized polymers satisfactorily by free radical polymerization. Indeed British Patent No. 1,431,446 to Rohm and Haas Corporation of USA teaches that As stated above the preparation of some oligomers from unsaturated monomers has been limited by the technology available for free radical polymerization and until the discovery of the present invention it was difficult to obtain polymers with chain lengths below 200 monomer units by free radical polymerization. Although techniques such as anionic or cationic polymerization in some circumstances can produce satisfactory oligomers from unsaturated monomers, the stringent reaction conditions required by these techniques are difficult to attain on an industrial scale, and in addition many monomers cannot be polymerized by these techniques. Anionic, cationic and step growth polymerizations are much more amenable to controlled growth since the reactions proceed one step at a time and can be stopped after a few steps if desired. Therefore, it would be desirable if the control achieved by step growth polymerization techniques could also be achieved by free radical polymerization, but without the disadvantages of the stringent reaction conditions. In the past the synthesis of block copolymers has been practically possible only by anionic polymerization although they could for a very limited number of monomers be made using cationic polymerization. The use of sequential addition of monomers in a conventional free radical polymerization leads to a mixture of homopolymers since there would be no living radicals at the end of each monomer addition step and new radicals would need to be produced to start the new monomer polymerizing. There are other methods known as transformation reactions that have been used to produce block copolymers of the AAAABBBB type. One of these is anionic polymerization of one monomer followed by reaction with bromine to give a bromo terminated polymer which is in turn reacted with silver perchlorate in the presence of the second monomer. This method is cumbersome and of limited applicability. Another method is anionic polymerization of one monomer followed by conversion of the anionic centre to a free radical by reaction with trimethyl lead chloride and heating this produces a block copolymer contaminated with homopolymer of the second monomer. Other transformation reactions are radical polymerization followed by cationic polymerization, or radical polymerization followed by anionic polymerization. All these methods suffer from the disadvantages mentioned above. A further development of block copolymers are graft copolymers which are polymeric materials consisting of a backbone polymer chain to which are attached a plurality of polymer chains, with the attached or grafted polymer being chemically different from the backbone polymer chain. By way of illustration a graft copolymer of two monomers A and B could have the following chemical structure Each of the backbones and grafted chains themselves may be copolymers of different monomers such as for example block copolymers. In addition either backbone or grafted chains may be branched. Because of their structure graft copolymers have unique properties, in particular the chemical coupling of unlike polymeric entities makes graft copolymers useful for their surface active properties particularly in stabilizing physical blends of other wise incompatible polymers or monomeric compounds. They are of considerable industrial interest. The usual method of formation of graft polymers involves first forming the polymer backbone or utilizing a naturally occurring polymer as a backbone and then creating an active polymerization initiating site at various places on the backbone polymer and utilizing this site to polymerize the necessary monomer s to form the graft chain. To form the graft chain the addition polymerization of vinyl monomers by free radical or cationic means, step growth polymerization, or ring opening polymerization of cyclic monomers may be utilized. A common method of producing graft copolymers by free radical polymerization of the grafted chain is by generating radical sites on the polymer backbone in the presence of the monomer to be grafted. The radical sites can be generated by hydrogen atom abstraction from the polymers by a free radical, by irradiating with ultraviolet or ionizing radication or by use of a redox system, e.g. Fe H₂O₂, when the backbone polymer contains suitable functional groups, e.g. hydroxyl. This general procedure usually gives rise to homopolymer as well as the desired graft copolymer. Using this method it is difficult to control the length of the grafted chains since the chains once initiated grow very rapidly until terminated by reaction with another radical. An alternative method of the prior art is to produce reactive monomeric units into a polymer chain by copolymerization methods or by chemically treating the backbone polymer. Acrylic polymers and copolymers, for example, may be treated with phosphorous pentachloride perester. The latter, upon decomposition, gives free radical sites for grafting. The direct peroxidation of the backbone polymer with peroxides and hydroperoxides can sometimes be employed, but attempts to introduce active groups directly into polystyrene by reacting with benzoyl peroxide have not been successful. If a comonomer containing isopropyl groups is introduced into the polystyrene chain, direct peroxidation can be achieved. US A 3163677 discloses N,N,O trisubstituted hydroxylamines including N,N,O,tri tertiarybutyl hydroxylamine, and the use of the nitroxide radical formed therefrom as, inter alia, polymerization inhibitors. The propagation of a polymer chain is stopped when the terminal free radical reacts with a nitroxide radical derived from the hydroxylamine. The nitroxide radical acts as a radical trap and is useful, for instance, to stabilise ethylenically unsaturated monomer containing liquids, such as styrene against polymerisation. It has been discovered that it is now possible to produce oligomeric and normal short chain length homo or copolymers by means of controlled growth free radical polymerization by processes in accordance with the present invention and by processes initiated by compounds in accordance with the present invention. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for the production of a polymer or a copolymer, particularly an oligomer, by free radical polymerization of a suitable unsaturated monomer, comprising heating with the monomer an initiator compound having the general structure of formula I wherein X is a group comprising at least one carbon atom and is such that the free radical X which does not initiate any substantial free radical polymerisation of the unsaturated monomer but which acts as a reversible terminator wherein X, R¹, R², R⁵ and R⁶ are as defined in connection with the compound of formula I above, and R Another aspect of the present invention is directed to polymers, particularly short chain oligomers, prepared by the processes of the present invention. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a block copolymer made by the polymerisation process of the present invention by alternately adding two or more monomers in order to produce a polymer with sequences of each monomer joined together. Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the production of graft copolymers by the processes of the present invention and to graft copolymers so produced. Preferably, scission of the O X bond is achieved at moderate temperatures, e.g., less than 200 Suitable groups for X are tertiary butyl, cyanoisopropyl, phenyl, methyl or the like. In one embodiment the structure of X wherein R, R and R , are the same or different and may be selected from hydrogen, alkyl, phenyl, cyano, carboxylic acid, or carbocyclic groups including substituted groups thereof. Suitable groups for R¹, R², R⁵, and R⁶ are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, Suitable groups for R³ and or R⁴ are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, wherein n is an integer from 1 to 10. The cyclic structure may be substituted and n is preferably 1 to 6 including such cyclic groups when substituted. For controlled free radical polymerisation by the initiators of Formula I the nitroxide radical of Formula II does not initiate any substantial free radical polymerisation of the unsaturated monomers itself. While alkoxy amines of which the compounds of Formula I form a sub group, are well known compounds, the compounds in accordance with Formula I are considered to be novel by virtue of the nature of their substituents. It has been discovered that hindered alkoxy amines generally in accordance with the present invention can be used as initiators of free radical polymerization at convenient temperatures. Further, it has been discovered that such polymerization processes proceed by insertion of monomer units between the nitroxide radical of Formula II and X by a reversible termination process. This process is called controlled growth free radical polymerization in the present specification. Alkoxy amines such as those of Formula I can be manufactured by heating a nitroxide radical of Formula II in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of a carbon centred free radical X The alkoxyamine so formed may be isolated and purified for later use or it may be used without further purification for the initiation of polymerization. The nitroxides of Formula II may be readily prepared by the oxidation of the appropriate secondary amine or hydroxylamine, reduction of the appropriate nitro or nitroso compound, or by the addition of free radicals to nitrones. Alternatively the alkoxyamine initiators can either by prepared or generated Preferably in the method of the present invention, the heating of the compounds of Formula I and the monomer is performed in a non polymerizable medium such as for example benzene, toluene, ethyl acetate. The method of this aspect of the present invention is particularly suitable for the production of oligomeric polymers and copolymers including block and graft copolymers, and of course includes the reaction of two or more different monomers. It is thus possible to control the polymerization processes of the present invention by selecting alkoxyamines of Formula I with appropriate substituents, selecting the polymerization temperature, and the amount and type of monomer s added at any one time. In one form of the polymers prepared by the processes of the present invention the polymers are oligomers which have functional groups capable of undergoing further chemical reactions to form useful materials. The polymers which may be graft or block copolymers produced by methods of the present invention will have at least one oxyamine group such as that shown as Formula II which is preferably a terminal oxyamine group on one end of the chain and an initiator residue X on the other end and depending upon the monomers used may have chemically reactive functional groups along the chain. Thus the products of this method will have at least one functional group per molecule. For technical, economic or other reasons it may be necessary or desirable to remove the oxyamine end group which may be accomplished in ways that give a stable functional group at the end of the polymer chain for instance to form a terminal hydroxy group or terminal hydrogen atom. For example, reduction by well known methods e.g. Zn CH₃OOH gives a hydroxy terminated polymer and a free amine terminated polymer may be reacted with hydrogen donors, e.g. thiols to give a hydrogen terminated polymer and hydroxylamine which can be reoxidised to the nitroxide, and with another free radical to give a range of terminal groups. In one preferred process a terminal oxyamine group is reacted so that the oxyamine group and a neighbouring group dissociate to form an unsaturated terminal group. If the last monomer unit is methyl methacrylate the oxyamine can decompose to form the unsaturated terminal group and a hydroxylamine these oligomeric polymers with terminal unsaturation have been named macromers. Macromers are capable of further polymerization or copolymerisation via the unsaturated group to give a polymer with pendent chains. The alkoxyamines may have other functional groups which can be used for further reactions of the oligomers if the Nitroxide end group can be kept as part of the polymer molecule. Alternatively the group X derived from the initial free radical initiator may contain functional groups. A mixture of monomers can be added in the polymerization step to produce a random copolymer similar to that produced by normal free radical polymerization except with controlled chain length. In contrast to the problems associated with prior art processes for producing block copolymers the method of the present invention produces block copolymers clearly with as many changes of monomer as desired and offers the possibility of producing block copolymers with short sequences of monomers. These would be a new class of materials with properties different from any other copolymer of the monomers concerned. If necessary the block copolymers can be provided with reactive functional groups as described above. In one embodiment of the processes of the present invention there is provided a two stage method for preparing a graft copolymer comprising firstly forming in a first stage reaction a polymer with pendent alkoxyamine groups of the general structure of Formula I having the group X attached to or part of the backbone polymer chains, and adding further monomer to the product of the first stage reaction followed by heating to form a graft copolymer by controlled growth free radical polymerization. The graft copolymer may be isolated in the ways well known in the art. The free radical polymerization preferably propagates in a step wise fashion so that graft copolymer substantially free from any homopolymer is formed. The alkoxyamine can be any of those specified in Formula I. The grafted chairs can be formed by any of the polymerization processes described herein and may themselves by homopolymers, random copolymers or block copolymers. To assist in understanding this aspect of the invention the chemistry of the graft polymerization process of the present invention is illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the reactions of the general types specifically illustrated by the examples for preparation of alkoxyamines and for their reaction. The formulae on pages 3 to 13 of the drawings structures 1 to 46 correspond to the structures of alkoxyamines and compounds produced from them as described in the following examples.
