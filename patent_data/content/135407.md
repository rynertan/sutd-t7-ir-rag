# Microwave power distributing and synthesizing device and microwave power amplifying apparatus including the same.

## Abstract
A microwave power distributing and synthesizing device comprising a first base 47 a second base facing the first base at a predetermined distance a coaxial line element including an inner conductive member 42 coaxially penet rating through a hole 48 of the second base, spaced from an inner wall of said hole, supported on the first base at one end, and forming at the other end an antenna protruding from the hole of the second base at least one of electric field distributing and synthesizing member 44 1, 44 5 arranged perpendicularly to the coaxial line element and a plurality of waveguides 49 1, 49 5 connected to the electric distributing and synthesizing member. Also, a microwave power amplifying apparatus includ ing a first such microwave power distributing and synthesiz ing device for receiving and distributing an input microwave signal a plurality of amplifiers connected to output ports of this first device and a second such microwave power distributing and synthesizing device having input ports connected to the amplifiers.
