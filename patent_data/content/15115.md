# Process for making partially pyrolyzed polymer particles.

## Abstract
Partially pyrolyzed particles of synthetic microspherical polymer containing at least 85 by weight carbon and having a carbon to hydrogen atom ratio of 1.5 1 to 20 1 are useful adsorbents. They may be produced by controlled thermal degradation in an inert atmosphere at a temperature of 300 to 2800 C of microspherical polymer such as an emulsion polymer of ethylenically unsaturated monomer which emulsion may be coagulated before pyrolysis. The thermal degradation takes place in the presence of a carbon fixing moiety, preferably sulfonate. Useful products include, besides the particles in powder form, the particles adhered to each other and, optionally, to partially pyrolyzed macrospherical polymer, to form a non spherical agglomerate.

## Description
PARTIALLY PYROLYZED POLYMER PARTICLES AND PROCESSES OF WAGING AND USING THEM This invention is concerned with partially pyrolyzed polymer particles and processes of making and using them. The invention relates to the field of carbonaceous adsorbents and their use in the removal of contaminants from liquids or gases. Partially pyrolyzed, macroporous, polymer adsorbent particles derived from suspension polymerized polymer beads containing carbon fixing moieties are disclosed byNeely in U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,046,990, the contents of which are hereby incorporated into this specification by reference. Such macrospherical materials are referred to herein as carbonaceous, macroporous polymer adsorbents and have shown highly useful adsorbent properties, particularly in such applications as removing impurities, e.g. sulfur compounds, monomers and other industrial contaminants or pollutants, from gases, and purifying pollutant containing liquid streams, such as waste streams containing phenolics or blood containing barbiturates.As those particles are derived by suspension polymerization, their physical form is beads having approximately the same diameters as conventional macrospherical ion exchange beads, that is, from about 0.05 to about 1 millimeter. Adsorbents of the prior art particle size range, when used at economically attractive flow rates for large scale treatment of gases or liquids, cause large pressure drops across packed beds of the adsorbents. The problems of pumping liquids against these large pressure drops have, in some instances, partially offset the advantages of the carbonaceous, macroporous polymer adsorbents over granular activated carbon. We have now discovered a class of partially pyrolyzed polymer particles which exhibit many of the desirable adsorbent properties of the carbonaceous, macroporous polymer particles of the Neely Patent specification, but which have significantly different particle sizes and therefore different physical properties. The partially pyrolyzed polymer particles which are the subject of this invention are derived from microspheres, usually emulsion polymer particles, having a maximum particle size of about 2rm and a preferred size range of about 0.05 to about lym. In the production of the products of the invention the microspheres themselves may be pyrolyzed an emulsion of them, usually the emulsion product of the polymerization process, maybe coagulated and the coagulum pyrolyzed or the coagulum may be pyrolyzed and subsequently resuspended as an emulsion of microspheres. The pyrolysis occurs in the presence of a carbon fixing moiety, this may be introduced by its presence in the monomers from which the particles are polymerized, it may be introduced by chemical reaction into the particles prior to pyrolysis., or it may be introduced by contact with the particles during heating for pyrolysis. Any of the carbon fixing moieties described in the Neely U.S. Patent is suitable. Large, non spherical, highly porous particles of partially pyrolyzed polymer having excellent hydraulic properties in high flow rate applications are preferably prepared by coagulating an emulsion of the microsphere polymer particles, introducing a carbon fixing moiety to the coagulum, and partially pyrolyzing the coagulum containing the carbon fixing moiety. The polymer particles to be pyrolyzed are preferably prepared by emulsion polymerization, wherein the monomers are emulsified in an aqueous medium with the aid of a surface active agent, and polymerization is initiated with a water soluble initiator. Suitable emulsion polymerization coagulation and redispersion techniques are further described in the specifications of copending European PatentApplications 79301937.3, 79301938.1, 79301936.5, 79301939.9 and 79301940.7, the contents of which are hereby incorporated into this specification by reference.The suitable monomers for emulsion polymerization to prepare the adsorbents of this invention are typically mixtures of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers and polyethylenically unsaturated crosslinker monomers, but materials useful in preparing the adsorbents of this invention may be prepared from sequential emulsion polymer particles having crosslinked copolymer cores and uncrosslinked surfaces, or from uncrosslinked emulsion polymer particles. At least a portion of the monomer emulsions used in preparing such sequential materials contains monoethylenically unsaturated monomer but no polyethylenically unsaturated monomer.Suitable monomers, both monoethylenically and polyethylenically unsaturated, for use in preparing polymer emulsions for pyrolysis are discussed by Neely in U.S. PatentSpecification 4,040,990. The carbon fixing moiety may be introduced, to a polymer as described in the European Patent Applications mentioned above, by coagulating the polymer emulsion and functionalizing the coagulum using conventional functionalization reactions, it may be present in one or more components of the monomer or monomer mixture e.g., vinylidene chloride , or in a more preferred embodiment the polymer emulsion may be coagulated and the carbon fixing moiety subsequently introduced during heating to sub pyrolysis temperatures by contacting the polymer emulsion with a coagulating and functionalizing reagent such as sulfuric acid.In a preferred embodiment an emulsion copolymer of styrene and commercial divinylbenzene is coagulated by a sulfuric acid solution having a concentration such that 1 to 2 moles of sulfuric acid are incorporated into the pores of the coagulum for each equivalent of copolymer.During the heating cycle in the pyrolysis oven, sulfonation of the copolymer occurs at temperatures below the pyrolysis temperature range. Levels of sulfuric acid higher than 2 moles per equivalent of copolymer may be employed to modify the properties of the pyrolyzed product. Other carbonfixing moieties include sulfonate, carboxyl, amine, halogen, oxygen, sulfonate salts, carboxylate salts and quaternary amine salts. The need for carbon fixing moiety in polymers to be pyrolyzed, as well as suitable further reagents and reactions for introducing carbon fixing moieties, are disclosed by Neely in U.S. Patent SpecificationNo. 4,040,990. The coagulum to be pyrolyzed is preferably drained of any free liquid, and is pyrolyzed as described by Neely.Products with useful adsorbent properties may be produced by controlling the pyrolysis at temperatures between about 3000C and about 2800 C. The pore structure and chemical composition of the pyrolyzed material may be varied by selecting temperatures within this range, and such variations will result in different ads orption properties. A more preferred pyrolysis temperature range is between 3000C and 12000C, and the most preferred range is between 5000C and 8000C.When a water wet coagulum is pyrolyzed, the preferred procedure is to use an inert gas blanket and hold the coagulum temperature between about 1000C and the lowest pyrolysis temperature, and most preferably at about 2000C, until the water is removed, after which the coagulum is heated to pyrolysis temperature.Pyrolysis time is not critical, the maximum pyrolysis temperature having a far greater effect on product properties than the time spent at that temperature. Pyrolysis time is further discussed Vy Neely in U.S. Patent No. 4,040,990, and this discussion pertains to the present invention also. Following pyrolysis the partially pyrolyzed material is allowed to cool, preferably still with the inert gas blanket to avoid oxidation. The pyrolyzed materials of this invention have a carbon to hydrogen ratio from 1.5 1 to 20 1, and a carbon content of at least 858 by weight. The remainder may typically be principally hydrogen, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, nitrogen, oxygenr sulfur, chlorine, derived from the polymer of the carbon fixing moiety. Because the particle size of the coagulum may be controlled over a wide range, including the size range of granular activated carbon particles, significantly lower pressure drops may be achieved at high flow rates across a bed of the highly porous, partially pyrolyzed coagulum particles than across a bed of conventionally sized, carbonaceous polymer adsorbent beads as disclosed in theNeely patent mentioned above. The coagulation techniques which provide this control of particle size include, but are not limited to, dropping, extruding or otherwise introducing the emulsion into a coagulant liquid, introducing coagulant to the emulsion while the latter is mixed at various rates, freezing and thawing the emulsion, stirring it vigorously, or drying it to a cake. As an alternative to pyrolyzing the coagulum itself, it may be resuspended subsequent to functionalization, or following the step of coagulating it with a coagulating and functionalizing agent, and the resulting emulsion may be dried and partially pyrolyzed to form a powdered, carbonaceous polymer adsorbent comprising spherical beads with diameters less than the two micrometers, or loose agglomerates of these beads. The individual beads have approximately the same size range as the emulsion ion exchange resin particles described in the European PatentApplications listed above, that is, from about 0.01 to about 2 micrometers, and preferably from about 0.05 to about 1 micrometer 1000 micrometers 1 millimeter .Further, the pyrolyzed coagulum may be resuspended by procedures discussed in the European Patent Applications mentioned above, to form the spherical beads with diameters less than 2 micrometers, or loose agglomerates of these beads, as described above. As yet another alternative, especially useful with microspheres that bear ion exchange functional groups, the micro sphere may be flocculated by mixing microspheres bearing cationic functional groups with those bearing anionic functional groups, and the resulting floc may be partially pyrolyzed. Similarly, microspheres bearing one ion exchange functionality may be bound to large particles conventional gel or macroreticular beads or bulk polymerized particles of ion exchange resin bearing the opposite functionality, i.e., cationic microspheres on anionic resins or anionic microspheres on cationic resins, for example as disclosed by Smallest al., inU.S. Patent No. 4,101,460, and both the large particles and microspheres may be partially pyrolyzed at the same time, yielding microspherical particles of the invention adhered to partially pyrolyzed macrospherical polymers. In the following Examples there are set out some preferred embodiments of the invention for the purposes of illustration only, All percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated, and all reagents are of good commercial quality.Preparation A This illustrates the preparation of a styrenedivinylbenzene emulsion copolymer. A mixture of 41.3 g of commercial divinylbenzene 55.2 divinylbenzene, remainder substantially ethylvinylbenzene and 148.7 g of styrene was added to a dispersion of 25.4 g of Triton X 200 Rohm and Haas Company, Philadelphia, Pa tradename for a 28 solids dispersion of sodium alkylyg tether sulfonate in 380 g of deoxygenated water, blanketed with nitrogen gas, and stirred vigorously to form a monomer emulsion.In a separate container 1 g of potassium persulfate was dissolved in SO gof deoxygenated water and blanketed with nitrogen to this was added 100 ml of the monomer emulsion.The mixture was stirred to form a l inch vortex, and was heated under the nitrogen blanket to 700C. The mixture was observed for the start of polymerization, indicated by a decrease in the opacity of the mixture. At that time addition of the remaining monomer emulsion was begun at such a rate that addition of all the remaining emulsion required 4 hours. After half of the remaining emulsion had been added, the mixture was heated and held at 750C A second monomer emulsion was prepared from 10 g of the commercial divinylbenzene, 1.3 g of the Triton X 200 and 20 g of deoxygenated water. Dropwise addition of this second emulsion was begun 30 minutes after addition of the first emulsion was complete.When addition of the second emulsion was complete the mixture was heated and held at 85 C for 3 hours, cooled to room temperature and filtered through cheesecloth. The solids content of the resulting emulsion was 28.8 by weight, compared to a theoretical value of 30.7 by weight.Preparation B This illustrates a simultaneous coagulation of the copolymer emulsion of Preparation A, and imbibing of a sulfuric acid carbon fixing moiety into the coagulum.An acid bath was prepared from 974 mi 179.4 g of 97 sulfuric acid and 2071 g of ice. Into this 193 g of the copolymer emulsion of Preparation A was slowly poured.When the addition was complete, the mixture was stirred for 0.5 hours to ensure complete equilibrium of the acid, and the coagulum was drained. The calculated weight ratio of sulfuric acid to copolymer in the coagulum was 1.35 g H2so4 g copolymer.Example 1 This illustrates the pyrolysis of the sulfuric acidimbibed coagulum of Preparation B to prepare carbonaceous particles of the present invention. The drained coagulum of Preparation B was transferred to a quartz tube of 2.51 cm diameter, blocked at one end with quartz wool.The tube was placed in a horizontal tube furnace and was swept with nitrogen gas at a flow rate of two liters per minute. The furnace was heated to 1000C over 30 minutes, held at 1000C for 1.0 hour, heated to 2000C over 30 minutes, held at 2000C for 2.5 hours, heated to 5000C over 30 minutes and held at 5000C for 1.0 hour. A colour change from white to pink was observed during the time at 1000C and 2000C. The pyrolyzed product was a dull black, granular solid with physical appearance and friability similar to granular activated carbon. Properties of the product are shown in the following table, with properties of a pyrolyzed, carbonaceous adsorbent bead of U.S. PatentNo. 4,040,990 shown for comparison.

A 0.1 g sample of adsorbent is plaX in a 250 ml wide mouth jar, and 200 ml of 50 ppm chloroform in water mixture is transferred to the jazzy pipette.The jar is capped and shaken for 24 hours, following which the residual chloroform content of the water is determined by a gas chromatographic analysis.Preparation C This illustrates the preparation of an emulsion copolymer having a crosslinked core and an uncrosslinked surface. A monomer emulsion was prepared by mixing under nitrogen 320 g of deoxygenated, deionized water, 20.2 g of 28 Triton X 200, 116.5 g styrene, and 43.5 g of 55.2 divinylbenzene balance essentially ethylvinylbenzene , and stirring vigorously. A 100 ml portion of this emulsion was mixed under nitrogen with 1.00 g potassium persulfate dissolved in 50 ml of deoxygenated, deionized water, and the mixture was heated and held at 700C for 30 minutes, after which the remaining emulsion was added dropwise over a period of 2.5 hours at 700C to form the crosslinked core emulsion.A second monomer emulsion was prepared by mixing 80 g deoxygenated, deionized water, 5.8 g of 28 Triton X 200 and 40 g of styrene, and this second emulsion was added to the crosslinked core emulsion over a period of one hour at 700C. Following this addition the emulsion was heated and held at 85 C for 30 minutes, then cooled to room temperature while stirring, and filtered through cheesecloth. The resulting emulsion had a solids content of 29.5 , versus a calculated solids content of 30.7 , and the emulsion particles had a diameter of approximately 0.1 micrometer. The crosslinked core comprised about 80 of each particle, and the uncrosslinked surface about 20 .Example 2 This illustrates the sulfonation and pyrolysis of the emulsion copolymer of Preparation C. The copolymer emulsion of Preparation C was coagulated by adding 50 ml of the emulsion dropwise to 200 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid, mixing, and allowing the mixture to stand at room temperature for 10 days. The coagulum was filtered, mixed with fresh, concentrated sulfuric acid, heated to l250C and held at that temperature for 2.5 hours. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into water. The supernatant liquid was decanted and the remaining solids were mixed with water and drained. The drained solids were pyrolyzed according to the procedure of Example 1, at 1000C for 1.5 hours and at 5000C for 1.0 hours.The resulting product was dull black, free flowing granules with adsorption properties similar to the product of Example 1. Preparation D This illustrates the preparation of an ultrafine particle size emulsion having 608 styrene core crosslinked with 32.7 divinylbenzene and 40t uncrosslinked styrene surface, and having an emulsion particle size of 0.05 micrometer. A reaction vessel was charged with 250 g of deoxygenated, deionized water, 35 g of 23 SiponateDS 4 A1colac Inc., Baltimore, MD, trademark for dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt and 0.8 g of potassium persulfRte dissolved in 50 g deionized water.The mixture was heated and held at 850C and an emulsion of 54 g of deoxygenated, deionized water, 2.7 g of Siponate DS 4, 72.5 g of 55 divinylbenzene balance essentially ethylvinylbenzene and 50 g of styrene was added over a period of 5,5 hours. A solution of 0.2 g potassium persulfate in 50 ml deoxygenated water was added, and a second monomer emulsion of 36 g of deoxygenated water, 1.1 g of Siponate DS 4, and 77.5 g of styrene was added over a period of 3.0 hours. After addition of the second monomer emulsion, the reaction mixture was chased with 0.4 g potassium persulfate dissolved in 75 ml deoxygenated water, then held at 85 C for 13 hours, cooled to room temperature, and filtered through cheesecloth.The solids content was 26.3 versus a calculated solids content of 30.7 . Example 3 The emulsion polymer product of Preparation D was sulfonated and pyrolyzed according to the procedure ofExample 2, to produce dull black granules.Preparation E This illustrates the preparation of a largerparticle size emulsion particle diameter approximately 0.4 micrometer . A preformed emulsion polymer having particle size of about 0.1 micrometer, a divinylbe nzene crosslinker content of 7 , and a solids content of 40 to 45 was prepared according to the procedure of Preparation A, and 25.0 g of this polymer was mixed w ith 348 g deoxygenated deionized water, heated and held at 900C. To the mixture 1.2 g of ammonium persulfate dissolved in 50 ml deoxygenated, deionized water, was added, and after 30 seconds the dropwise addition of an emulsion of 180 g deoxygenated, deionized water, 12.9 g Triton X 200, 0.72 g ammonium persulfate, 314 g of styrene and 45.8 g of 55 divinylbenzene balance essentially ethylvinylbenzene was begun.This emulsion was added to the preformed emulsion polymer mixture over a period of 2 hours tand a second emulsion of 20 g deoxygenated, deionized water, 1.4 g Triton X 200, 0.08 g ammonium persulfate, 37.6 g styrene and 0.4 g of 55 divinylbenzene was added dropwise over 10 minutes.The emulsion was held at 900C for an additional 30 minutes, cooled to room temperature over a 30 minute period and filtered through cheesecloth. The product emulsion contained 39.1 solids.Example 4 This illustrates the sulfonation and pyrolysis of the emulsion of PreparationE. To 92 ml of deionized water 108 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added the resulting solution reached a temperature of 1300C. To this hot sulfuric acid solution 51 ml of the emulsion ofPreparation E was added, and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes. The resulting coagulum was filtered, drained, and pyrolyzed according to the procedure of Example 1. Example 5 This illustrates the chlorination of the pyrolyzed emulsion coagulum from Example 3. Chlorination provides information on the relative activity of adsorbents, and the maximum temperature reached within the adsorbent bed during treatment with chlorine Tmax correlates closely to the effectiveness of the adsorbent for removing chloroform from water. A 1 g sample of the pyrolyzed material fromExample 3 was transferred to a 1 cm diameter glass tube, and held in place with glass wool. The tube was clamped in a vertical position, a temperature probe was inserted in the pyrolyzed material, and chlorine gas was passed upward through the sample. The maximum temperature indicated by the temperature probe Tmax TmaX was 2330C.After chlorine breakthrough, the sample was transferred to an oven and held at 110 C overnight to drive off any adsorbed, unreacted chlorine, The sample was subsequently cooled to room temperature and weighed The weight change, AWt.
