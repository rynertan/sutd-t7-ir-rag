# Reversible settee or easy chair.

## Abstract
A reversible settee or easy chair is disclosed which has a seat 1 accessible from and utilisable at either side, and a back 5 that can be positioned in at least two positions overlying the two opposite front and rear edges of the seat. The visible surfaces of at least one side of the back and seat are provided with a single loose cover 10 or 11 which is anchored to the top of the back 5 and made fast to the outer edge of the seat.

## Claims
Claims 1 Reversible settee or easy chair characterised in that it comprises a back 5 that can be moved with respect to a seat 1 which is accessible from either side, in such a way as to allow of positioning the back at least at the two opposite front and rear sides of the seat. 2 Settee as in claim 1 wherein the visible surfaces of at least one of the front and rear sides of the back 5 and of the seat 1 are provided with a loose cover 10 or 11 anchored to the back at least along the top part thereof, and made fast to the seat at least along the outer edge thereof. 3 Settee as in preceding claims wherein the back 5 is fitted to a frame 6 hinged to the underframe 3 of the seat 1 about a longitudinal axis. 4 Settee as in claim 2 wherein the loose cover 10 or 11 that covers the visible surfaces of the back 5 and of the seat 1 at the front or rear side, is provided at each end with two flaps 14, 15 sandwiched together and designed to cover the rear part of each of the cor responding ends of the settee. 5 Settee as in claim 3 wherein the back 5 is hinged to the seat 1 about a horizontal axis lying within the vertical median plane which bisects the seat longitudi nally, and may be set at two fully extended positions overlying the two opposite sides or frontal edges of the seat and wherein the two positions are symmetrical with respect to said vertical and longitudinal median plane. 6 Settee as in claim 5 wherein stops 8, 9 are provided for each of the symmetrical positions into which the back may be manoeuvred, and are located so as to check two parallel laths 7 which constitute part of the frame 6 to which the back is fitted and wherein the ends of the parallel laths 7 are hinged to the under frame 3 of the seat.

## Description
Reversible settee or easy chairThe invention relates to a reversible settee or easy chair.There are conventional settees and arm chairs or easy chairs which feature certain parts of the back or seat, or even the cover alone, that may be changed over or replaced. It is usually the case with such furniture that change over of the cover, whilst presenting no special difficulty, is a somewhat laborious and timeconsuming operation.The invention, as disclosed and characterised in the appended claims, seeks to embody a reversible settee or easy chair in which the switch or change over may be carried out swiftly and simply, involving no more in practical terms than alteration of the position of the back relative to the seat.The invention will now be described, by way of example, with the aid of the accompanying drawings, in which fig 1 is a view in perspective and in cutaway fig 2 is a side view of the embodiment in fig 1.With reference to the drawings, 1 denotes the seat of a settee which is embodied such as to be accessible from either side, and utilised at either side. Arms 2 are located at either end of the seat 1.The cutaway of fig 2 illustrates an underframe 3 which carries the seat and is set on casters 4 that permit effortless movement of the seat, hence of the entire settee, over the floor on which it stands. 5 denotes a back, fitted to a frame 6, which is hinged to the underframe 3 so as to turn on a horizontal axis lying within a vertical median plane that bisects the seat longitudinally. The back 5 is hinged to the underframe 3 at either end of the seat via the ends of two parallel laths 7 which constitute part of the frame 6, and may be set at two fully extended positions A and B overlying the two opposite sides or frontal edges of the seat.These two positions are disposed symmetrically with respect to the vertical and longitudinal median plane through which the back 5 is hinged, and stops 8 and 9 for each such symmetrical position are located such as to check the parallel laths 7 at a point along their length near to the ends hinged with the underframe 3. The visible surfaces of at least one of the two front and rear sides of the back and seat of the settee are provided with a cover.In the embodiment illustrated, the visible surfaces of both the front and rear sides of the back 5 and of the seat 2 are provided with a respective loose cover 10 and 11. These two covers may differ both in colour and in material one, for instance, might be in leather, the other in fabric.The two loose covers 10 and 11 are anchored to the top part of the back 5, and more precisely, along the top edge 12 as illustrated in fig 2 , and made fast to the seat 1, at least along the outer edge, so hs to conceal the seat entirely, and conceal the arms to a certain extent. Each of the two covers 10 and 11 is provided at either end with two respective flaps 14 and 15 which are sandwiched together, and conceal the rear part of the ends of the settee in a manner, and for reasons, that will become clear in due course.Change over from one side and covering of the settee to the reverse is swift and simple, accomplished by moving the back 5 from position A to position B, or viceversa.In position A the accessible side of the settee is that exhibiting cover 11, whereas cover 10 lies concealed at the rear. To effect the switch, it suffices simply to move the back 5 from position A over into position B, whereupon the accessible side of the settee will become that exhibiting cover 10, which during passage of the back 5 from one position to the other will be spread out over the now visible surfaces of the seat and back. The change over is made complete by concealing the rear part of the two ends of the settee with the flaps 14 and 15 provided at either end of the cover 10, which when in place will hide the ends of cover 11 from view entirely.This done, the settee can be revolved on its casters 4 in order to face in the appropriate direction.The fact of the disclosure relating to a settee by no means excludes its application to other types of seat, such as arm chairs or easy chairs.
