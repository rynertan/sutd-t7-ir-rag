## Description
The present invention relates to a process of obtaining a hypoallergenic moss oil from a starting moss oil obtained by the extraction from epiphytic moss on the bark of trees and generally includes, for example, oakmoss oil, treemoss oil, cedarmoss oil, and moss oils produced in China. Oakmoss, Mousse de chêne Evernia Prunastri L. Ach. was used for baking bread in ancient Egypt and also widely used as a universal panacea in the East during the 12th century. Oakmoss is now recognized as an important perfume starting material and that oil is extremely widely used for the compound perfume of odor products, cosmetics, soaps, and detergents, similarly, Treemoss, Mousse d arbre Evernia furfuracea L. Mann and cedarmoss are also widely used as starting materials similar to oakmoss. Recently, moss produced in China, Evernia mesormopha, and Cetrariastrum nepalensis are being used in the same application fields. Moss oil is indispensable for constituting the so called chypre type fragrances and is also frequently used for a base note providing the volume and richness. It is reported in Monographs on Fragrance Raw Materials Edited by D.L. Opdyke, Pergamon Press 1979 that moss oil is used in the United States in an amount of about 50 tons year i.e., oakmoss oil 34 tons year, treemoss oil 16 tons year . However, it is reported in, for example, I. Dahlquist, S. Fregert Contact allergy to atranorin in lichens and perfumes, Contact Dermatitis, 6,111 1980 P. Thune, Y. Solberg et al Perfume allergy due to oakmoss and other lichens, Contact Dermatitis, 8,396 1982 and M. Sandberg, P. Thune The sensitizing capacity of atranorin, Contact Dermatitis, 11,168 1984 that moss oils cause positive reactions in patients with cosmetic contact dermatitis. The present inventors conducted allergenicity tests with respect to commercially available moss oils and confirmed, as shown in Comparative Example 1 hereinbelow, that the commercially available moss oils have a very very strong allergenicity. Accordingly the object of the present invention is to provide a process of obtaining a hypo allergenic moss oil. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process of obtaining a hypo allergenic moss oil by removing ethylhematommate, ethylchlorohematommate and chloroatranorin from a starting moss oil, obtained by the extraction from epiphytic moss on the bark of trees, with at least one treatment selected from the group consisting of chromatography, solvent extraction, countercurrent partition, and membrane separation and a further treatment consisting of a catalytic hydrogenation treatment or both a catalytic hydrogenation treatment and an alkaline treatment. The moss oil obtained according to the process of the invention contains no substantial amount of A substances having a count number of 40.5 to 45 or B substances having a count number of 30 to 45, determined by gel permeation chromatography i.e., GPC in four TSKGEL G2000H8 columns HLC 802UR manufactured by Toyo Soda Kogyo Co. in Japan under the conditions defined below. The present invention will be better understood from the description set forth below with reference to the accompanying drawings in which According to a study by the present inventors, it has been found that the allergenic substances are concentrated in certain fractions of the natural moss oil as shown in Comparative Example 2 mentioned hereinbelow. After an extensive study of the allergenic fractions, we have found that the allergenic substances contained in the specific allergenic fractions include the following four compounds. According to our study, moss oils not containing the ethyl hematommate and ethyl chlorohematommate i.e., hematommates and the atranorin and chloro atranorin i.e., atranorins as well as A substances having a count number of 40.5 to 45 i.e., substances A or B substances having a count number of 30 to 45 i.e., substances B , determined by the above mentioned gel permeation chromatography have no substantial allergenicity. Such moss oils can be produced from the natural moss oils by various separation techniques for removing the allergenic substances and by subjecting the moss oils to a catalytic hydrogenation and optionally to an alkaline decomposition treatment i.e., alkaline treatment . Thus, the desired hypo allergenic moss oils can be advantageously obtained while retaining the inherent odor of the moss oils. The typical treatment and separation methods will now be explained below. The catalytic hydrogenation methods typically include normal pressure methods and high pressure methods. It has been found that the hydrogenation of the hematommates can be quantitatively carried out even under a normal pressure, when a suitable catalyst is selected. When a large amount of moss oil is hydrogenated, a high pressure method is advantageously used. However, the reaction temperature is preferably not higher than 100 C for the reason that the possible thermal decomposition of the components providing the desired odor should be avoided. Examples of the catalysts usable for the catalytic hydrogenation of the moss oil are any conventional hydrogenation catalysts such as Ni catalysts and platinum metal i.e., Pt, Pd, Ph, and Ru catalysts. Of these conventional hydrogenation catalysts, the use of 10 palladium supported on activated carbon i.e., 10 Pd C or a Raney Ni catalyst is preferable for the purpose of the present invention. The preferable amount of the catalyst is 5 to 30 by weight of the moss oil to be hydrogenated. The hydrogenation reaction is usually carried out in, for example, an organic solvent such as methanol and ethanol at room temperature for 5 to 24 hours. Thus, the quantitative hydrogenation is effected. The moss oil is subjected to alcoholic decomposition or hydrolysis in an aqueous alcoholic alkaline solution. Examples of the alkaline compounds usable in the alkaline treatment are sodium hydroxide NaOH , potassium hydroxide KOH , and sodium carbonate, and examples of the alcohols are methanol and ethanol. According to the alkaline treatment, hematommates and atranorins are readily decomposed, whereby the allergenicity of these compounds is reduced or eliminated. Although there are no critical limitations to the alkaline treatment conditions, the alkaline treatment is preferably carried out at a temperature of room temperature to 50 C at an alkaline solution concentration of 10 ⁴ to 1N. According to this method, the desired hypo allergenic moss oil can be effectively produced by treating the starting moss oil with an non polar or less polar solvent such as pentane, hexane, benzene, or ether by using a column packed with an adsorbent. Examples of such adsorbents are activated carbon, activated clay, silica gel, synthetic adsorbents such as Amberlyte XAD series Registered Trademark, manufactured by Rhom Haas Co., Ltd. , ion exchange resins such as Amberlyst series Registered Trademark, manufactured by Rhom Haas Co., Ltd. . The preferable adsorbents are silica gels e.g., Kieselgel 60 manufactured by Merck Co. . On the other hand, the moss oil can be effectively separated with a polar solvent such as water, methanol, ethanol, and chloroform, by using a column packed with dextran gel having a three dimensional structure such as Sephadex, Sephadex LH Registered Trademark, series manufactured by Pharmacia Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd. . According to this method, the hypo allergenic moss oil can be effectively produced by using, typically, a GPC column for organic solvents. The preferable exclusion limit of the GPC column is 5 10³ to 1 10⁴ and the typical solvents usable in the preparatory GPC are tetrahydrofuran THF and chloroform. The separation is carried out in accordance with the chromatogram pattern obtained by an RI detector. According to this method, the desired hypo allergenic moss oil can be separated through a reverse phase column. As the reverse phase column, columns comprising silica gels having a methyl, ethyl, octyl, or octadecyl group chemically bonded thereto are typically used. The desired moss oil can be separated with a solvent system, containing as a main constituent methanol, by using a UV detector so that the hematommates and atranorins are not contained in the separated moss oil. The present invention now will be further illustrated by, but is by no means limited to, the following Comparative Examples and Examples, wherein all parts and percentages are expressed on a weight basis, unless otherwise specified. The allergenicity tests of commercially available oakmoss oils, treemoss oils, and cedarmoss oils were carried out. The results are shown in Table 1. As is clear from the results shown in Table 1, natural moss oils have strong allergenicity. The allergenicity test was carried out as follows. Ten healthy Hartley strain albino guinea pigs weighing between 380 g and 450 g were used as a group of test animals. The test was carried out according to a Modified Maximization Test Sato, Y. et al A modified technique of guinea pig testing to identify delayed hypersensitivity allergens Contact Dermatitis, 7, 225 237, 1981 . The inducing or sensitizing treatment was first conducted by injecting Freund s Complete Adjuvant available from Difco Co., Ltd., i.e., FCA hereinbelow intradermally at the shoulder region of the guinea pigs in an amount of 0.1 ml at each of four point. Then a criss cross lattice of abrasives made at each injection site. A 0.1 ml amount of the sample to be tested was applied to lint cloths i.e., Torii adhesive tape for a patch test and the cloths were applied to the injected sites occlusively for 72 hours. After 7 days from the intradermal injection, the injected sites were shaved and a 10 W W concentration of sodium lauryl sulfate in white petrolatum was applied to each injected site. After one day, 0.2 ml of test material was applied occlusively for 48 hours. Thus, the inducing treatment was completed. After 21 days from the intradermal injection, 10 µl of the test sample solutions in acetone having the challenge concentrations listed in Table 1 were applied topically to the shaved back skin of the sensitized guinea pigs i.e. challenge test under an open air environment. As a control, ten guinea pigs, in which only an emulsion obtained by emulsifying FCA with an equal amount of water was intradermally injected during the sensitizing treatment, were used and the challenge test was carried out in the same manner as described above. Thus, the non specific skin irritation reaction of the test sample was distinguished. The results were examined after 24 and 48 hours from the application. The observation or evaluation was based on the following scoring criteria. Figure 1 illustrates a GPC chromatogram and the fractions separated by preparative GPC of the oakmoss oil 1. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate GPC chromatograms of a commercially available treemoss oil 1 and cedarmoss oil 1. As shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3, and as known in the art, these natural moss oils exhibit similar chromatograms since the components contained therein are similar to each other. On the other hand, it is known the art that the components contained in moss oils derived from the same type of moss are sometimes largely different from each other depending upon, for example, the origin or the type of extraction solvents. Figures 4, 5, and 6 illustrate the GPC chromatograms and the fractions separated by preparatory GPC of the oakmoss oils 2, 3, and 4 in Table l, respectively. As is clear from the comparison of Fig. l with Figs. 4, 5, and 6, it is not unusual that the GPC chromatograms of commercially available oakmoss oils are different. The preparative GPC separation conditions were the same as in the above mentioned case, except that the sample injection concentration was 20 . The allergenicity test results of the oakmoss oil fraction Nos. 1 and 2 obtained as GPC separated fractions, as shown in Figures 1 and 4, are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The concentrations of the challenge test were such that the total amounts were adjusted to 1.0 and that the compositions of the challenge test correspond to those of each fraction. As a result, it became clear which fractions affect the overall allergenicity of the moss oil. As is clear from the results shown in Tables 2 and 3, the fractions F 2 and F 5 in the case of the oakmoss oil 1 and the fractions F 1, F 2, F 5, and F 6 in the case of the oakmoss oil 2 had a strong allergenicity. A similar tendency was shown in the case of treemoss oil and cedarmoss oil. Thus, the substances included in the fraction F 2 in Table 2 were identified as a group A i.e., substances A and, furthermore, it was found that ethyl hematommate and ethyl chlorohematommate were contained, as the allergenic components, in the fraction F 5 of Table 2. The mass spectra of these compounds are shown in Fig. 7. The allergenicity test results of these compounds are shown in Table 4. As is clear from the results shown in Table 4, these compounds have a strong allergenicity even in the very low concentration. Furthermore, the substances included in the fractions F 1 and F 2 in Table 3 were identified as a group B i.e., substances B . From the analysis of the components contained in the fraction F 5, it has been found that atranorin and chloroatranorin are contained as the main allergenic substances in the fraction F 5. The allergenicity results of these compounds are shown in Table 5. As is clear from the results shown in Table 5, atranorin and chloroatranorin have a strong allergenicity even in the very low concentration. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that the allergenic substances contained in the fraction F 6 of Table 3 were ethyl hematommate and ethyl chlorohematommate. The above mentioned results have been also confirmed similarly in the case of commercially available treemoss oil and cedarmoss oil. A 10 g amount of the oakmoss oil 1 used in comparative Example 1 was subjected to preparative column chromatography i.e., CC in the Table hereinbelow . That is, the oakmoss oil was treated with 3 liters of mixed solvent i.e., 1 liter of hexane, 1 liter of hexane ether 90 10 , and hexane ether 80 20 in a column packed with 200 g of silica gel i.e., Kieselgel 60 available from MERCK C., Inc. . Thus, 4.3 g of the treated oakmoss oil having no substances A shown in Fig. 1 was obtained. The treated oil had a good odor, which was substantially the same as that of the untreated oil. However, as shown in Fig. 8, the treated oil contained the allergenic substances, hematommates. Accordingly, 4.3 g of the treated oil obtained above was dissolved in 20ml of ethanol purified by distillation and was then hydrogenated in a 100ml three necked round bottom flask by adding 0.4 g of a 10 Pd C catalyst. The flask was allowed to stand at room temperature and normal pressure for 24 hours under a hydrogen atmosphere, while stirring with a stirrer. After 24 hours, the reaction mixture was filtered through a cylindrical funnel type glass filter provided with a filter paper, followed by washing, three times, with 90ml of 99.5 ethanol. The filtrate and the washing filtrate were combined and the ethanol was removed under a reduced pressure. The yield of the hydrogenated oil was 3.8. The allergenicity test result of the treated oakmoss oil finally obtained i.e., CC hydrogenated oakmoss oil 1 1 is shown in Table 7. As is clear from the result shown in Table 7, the oakmoss oil having a remarkably reduced allergenicity was obtained by the combination of the preparative column chromatography and the hydrogenation treatment. The HPLC chromatogram of the resultant CC hydrogenated oakmoss oil is shown in Fig. 9. As is clear from the comparison of Fig. 8 with Fig. 9, the hematommates were converted to other compounds. The organoleptic test regarding the odor of the oakmoss oil before and after the treatment was carried out in the same manner as mentioned above. As a result, it was found that the odor of the treated oil was as good as that of the untreated oil. A 10 g amount of the oakmoss oil 1 used in comparative Example 1 was subjected to preparative column chromatography. That is, the oakmoss oil was treated with 4 liters of a mixed solvent i.e., 1 liter of hexane, 1 liter of hexane ether 90 10 , hexane ether 80 20 , and hexane ether 70 30 in a column packed with 200 g of silica gel i.e., Kieselgel 60 available from MERCK Co., Inc. . Thus, 5.4 g of the treated oakmoss oil having no substances A shown in Fig. 1 was obtained. The treated oil had a good odor, which was substantially the same as that of the untreated oil. However, the treated oil contained the hematommates similarly as in Example 1. Accordingly, 5.4 g of the treated oil mentioned above was dissolved in 20 ml of ethanol purified by distillation and was then hydrogenated by adding 0.5 g of a Raney nickel catalyst W6 in the same manner as in Example 1. The yield was 4.7 g. The allergenicity test result of the treated oakmoss oil i.e., CC hydrogenated oakmoss oil 1 2 finally obtained is shown in Table 8.

Thus, 3.5 g of the treated treemoss oil having no substances A shown in Fig. 2 was obtained. The treated oil had a good odor, which was substantially the same as that of the untreated oil. However, the treated oil contained the hematommates similarly as in Example 1.

As is clear from the result shown in Table 9, the treemoss oil having a remarkably reduced allergenicity was obtained by the combination of the preparative column chromatography and the hydrogenation treatment. The organoleptic test regarding the odor of the treemoss oil before and after the treatment was carried out in the same manner as mentioned above. As a result, it was found that the odor of the treated oil was as good as that of the untreated oil. A 10 g amount of the oakmoss oil 1 used in comparative Example 1 was subjected to preparative column chromatography. That is, the oakmoss oil was treated with 3 liters of a mixed solvent i.e., 1 liter of hexane, 1 liter of hexane ether 90 10 , and hexane ether 80 20 in a column packed with 200 g of silica gel i.e., Kieselgel 60 available from MERCK Co., Inc. . Thus, 4.4 g of the treated oakmoss oil having no substances A shown in Fig. 1 was obtained. The treated oil had a good odor, which was substantially the same as that of the untreated oil. A 4.4 g amount of the treated oakmoss oil was then dissolved in 8.8 liters of 10 ³N NaOH in ethanol solution and the resultant solution was allowed to stand for 24 hours at a constant temperature bath having a temperature of 50 C. After 24 hours, the solution was neutralized with 0.5N HCl and the solvent was then removed under a reduced pressure. The residue was extracted with acetone, followed by filtration. The acetone was then removed under a reduced pressure to obtain 3.7 g of the alkaline treated i.e., AL oil. A 3.7 g amount of the treated oil was then dissolved in 20 ml of ethanol purified by distillation and was then hydrogenated by adding 0.3 g of a 10 Pd C catalyst in the same manner as in Example 1. The yield was 3.4 g. The allergenicity test result of the treated oakmoss oil i.e., CC AL hydrogenated oakmoss oil 1 finally obtained is shown in Table 10. As is clear from the result shown in Table 10, the oakmoss oil having a remarkably reduced allergenicity was obtained by the combination of the preparative column chromatography, alkaline treatment, and the hydrogenation treatment. The organoleptic test regarding the odor of the oakmoss oil before and after the treatment was carried out in the same manner as mentioned above.
