# REDUCING COMBUSTION NOISE IN A FUEL INJECTED ENGINE

## Abstract
The pressure pulses travelling along fuel lines to fuel injectors produce noise when the engine is running. In order to reduce this noise attempts are made to modify the shape of the pulse pressure front before it reaches the cylinder. In particular, it is desirable to reduce the rate of rise of the pressure front which in turn reduces the fuel mass flow rate into the cylinder. This has an effect on the combustion prop agation within the cylinder combustion chamber and thus reduces noise. To achieve this desirable end, a filter 14 is positioned in the fuel line between the injector pump 10 and the injector 18. This filter has an internal chamber in which the pressure pulse is reflected and then interferes with itself to construct a new pulse of a desirable form.
