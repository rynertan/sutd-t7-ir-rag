# A semiconductor integrated circuit device comprising an MOS transistor and a bipolar transistor and a manufacturing method of the same.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit device is disclosed which comprises a bipolar transistor and a field effect transistor, in which a gate electrode 38, 39 of the field effect transistor and a collector electrode 40₂ of the bipolar transistor are formed from a common electrode layer 102 of a high impurity concentration, and in which the collector region 24₂ of the bipolar transistor comprises a region 100 of a high impurity concentration having a conductivity type the same as that of the collector region 24₂ of the bipolar transistor.
