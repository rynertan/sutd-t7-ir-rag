## Description
ROTARY TRANSMISSION This invention relates to rotary transmissions of the dual clutch kind by which is meant a transmission having gear trains each being one of a set providing a series of increasing speed ratios, and two clutches independently operable and providing alternative drive paths through the gear trains between a common input and a common output, the gear trains of alternate speed ratios in the set being driven respectively through one and the other clutch. The invention is particularly though not exclusively applicable to drive transmissions for motor vehicles. Examples of transmissions of the dual clutch kind are shown in BritishPatent Specifications Nos. 145,827 Bramley Moore , 585,716 Kegresse , 795,260 David Brown and 1,225,267 Bosch . To the best of our knowledge, none of these prior proposals has been commercially adopted. It has been proposed to derive transmissions of the dual clutch kind from conventional single clutch manual change transmissions with which they can share many component parts. It has been realised however, that some arrangements of transmission components can result in a transmission of relatively short overall length. Such a transmission is particularly advantageous for transverse engined front wheel drive motor vehicles where spatial parameters often dictate engine transmission units of very short overall length. Transmissiorsof the dual clutch kind may include hydraulic control apparatus and may further be provided with a hydrodynamic coupling for drive take up from rest. Such transmissions require a pump, preferably driven directly by the engine, to supply hydraulic fluid under pressure to the hydraulic apparatus. It has been proposed to situate the pump at one end or other of the drive shaft of a hydraulic transmission but this can substantially increase the overall transmission length, which is undesirable, and dictate the use of relatively large pump drive gear wheels. According to the present invention there is provided a rotary power transmission comprising a drive input shaft, first and second clutches arranged to be driven by said drive input shaft, said clutches including driven members spaced apart and journal led for rotation on said drive input shaft gear trains for transmitting drive from the driven members to the drive output shaft, said gear trains providing increasing speed ratios and said clutches being arranged to drive respectively through the gear trains of alternate speed ratios, and an oil pump drive gear provided on the drive input shaft in the space between said driven members. By arranging the pump drive gear in such a manner it is possible to avoid positioning the pump at one end of the drive input shaft thereby avoiding any increase in overall length of the transmission. Preferably the drive members are rotatably fast with driving gears of the trains and the pump drive gear is provided on the drive shaft between two driving gears on the respective driven members. The oil pump drive gear preferably meshes with a further gear drivably connected to a drive shaft of the pump to position the drive shaft clear of the gear trains.Such an arrangement enables the oil pump to be mounted out of the plane of the gear trains. The invention confers the additional advantage that the number of concentric members about the clutch drive shaft is kept to a minimum whilst ensuring that the oil pump is driven at engine speed. Other features of the invention are included in the following description of a preferred embodiment shown, by way of example only, in the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of a four speed transmission of the dual clutch kind incorporating the invention, and Fig. 2 is a cross section of part of the transmission of Fig. 1 on the line in inFig. 1. With reference to the drawings there is shown a transmission having a set of four gear trains providing a series of increasing speed ratios. Drive from an engine not shown is transmitted via a drive input shaft 11 through a torque converter 12 and clutch 14, situated at one side of the transmission, to first and third speed ratios. Drive is provided through another clutch 13, at the other side of the transmission, to second and fourth speed ratios. The first and third speed ratios are provided by two gear trains comprising driving gears 15, 17 and driven gears 22, 24 respectively. The second and fourth speed ratios are provided by two gear trains comprising driving gears 16, 18 and driven gears 23, 25 respectively. The driving gears 16, 18 15, 17 of the gear trains are rotatably fast with respective tubular driven members 13a 14a of the clutches 13 14. The driven members 13a, 14a are journaled coaxially for rotation on the input shaft 11.The driven gears of the gear trains are selectively connectable to an output shaft 21 by synchroniser assemblies 32, 33 movable in the directions of arrows in Figure 1 to select ratio 1, 2, 3 or 4. Clutch control and speed ratio selection is preferably by automatic means not shown , speed ratios being selected sequentially from the set. In operation a change of speed ratio comprises the steps of disengaging the non driving clutch, pre selecting the next required speed ratio, disengaging the driving clutch whi Ist simultaneously engaging the non driving clutch, deselecting the hitherto selected speed ratio and re engaging the now non driving clutch. The torque converter is provided for drive take up from rest, drive in fourth ratio being provided through clutch 13 for maximum fuel economy. A drive gear 34 for an oil pump 35 Fig. 2 is provided on the input shaft 11. The gear 34 lies in a space 36 between adjacent ends of clutch driven members 13a, 14a and a suitable working clearance is defined between the said adjacent ends and the side surfaces of the gear. The gear may be formed integrally with the input shaft 11 or may comprise a gear wheel rotatably secured to the input shaft. The drive gear 34 meshes with a further gear 37 mounted on a drive shaft 38 of the pump35. The pump drive shaft 38 is parallel with the input shaft 11 and lies clear of the diving gears 15 or 16. In that way the pump can be mounted out of the plane of the gear trains and thus not add significantly to the overall length of the transmission. Also the pump can conveniently be mounted in the same housing 39 as the transmission. It may be seen that if the oil pump drive were mounted on the drive input shaft 11 at either side of the transmission excessively large gear wheels would be needed to clear the torque converter 12 at one side and the clutch 13 at the other side.
