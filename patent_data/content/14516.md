# Forming irradiated regions in semiconductor bodies by nuclear radiation.

## Abstract
Irradiated regions 28 are formed in materials such as semiconductor bodies by nuclear radiation 23 where the irradiated regions 28 are of a desired thickness, dosage and dosage gradient, a desired distance from a selected surface 11 of the material. A nuclear radiation beam 23 from a given radiation source radiating particles with molecular weight of at least one 1 is provided that can penetrate the material through a selected surface 11 to a depth greater than the maximum depth of the irradiated region from the selected surface. A beam modifier 26 of a given material and non uniform shape to modify the energy of the radiation beam 23 is interposed between the source and the material to form a transmitted radiation beam 23 capable of forming an irradiated region 28 of a desired thickness and dosage gradient in the material a given distance from the selected surface on irradiation of the material through the selected surface 11 with the transmitted radiation beam.
