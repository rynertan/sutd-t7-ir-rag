# Thermoplastic dispensing device.

## Abstract
The device 10 which an operator grips while using his thumb to press a solid block 24 of the thermoplastic material through a sleeve 20 and into a heated melting chamber 16 from which the molten thermoplastic material is discharged through a nozzle 21. The device 10 includes a bracket 28 adapted to hold a second block 24 of thermoplastic material in end to end relationship with a first block 24 in the sleeve 20, and a heated barrier ring 38 at the inlet to the melting chamber 16 that restricts escape of the molten thermoplastic material through the sleeve 20 and may also include a slidable pressure plate 32 between the block and an oper ator s thumb and or a trigger operated outlet valve between the melting chamber and nozzle 21.
