# Method and apparatus for connecting a flowline to a subsea structure and laying the flowline from the subsea structure.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are provided for connecting an offshore pipeline or flowline bundle 10 to a deepwater sub sea structure 11 and then laying the pipeline or flowline bundle 10 away from said structure 11 . The pipeline or flowline bundle 10 is lowered vertically from a pipelaying vessel 13 to make a hinged connection with the subsea structure 11 . The connection operation is facilitated by a flowline connection tool 14 attached to the pipeline or flow line bundle 10 and designed to be inserted into a funnel located either centrally or on one side of the subsea structure 11 . The connection procedure comprises landing and secur ing the flowline connection tool 14 onto the subsea structure 11 , then hinging over and connecting the pipeline or flowline bundle 10 to the subsea structure 11 as the pipeline or flowline bundle 10 is laid on the sea floor 12 beginning at the subsea structure 11 .
