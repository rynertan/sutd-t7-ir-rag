# Coating method and product thereof.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a coating method and to the product produced by such method. In the preferred practice of this invention, the method includes the steps of selecting a ferrous substrate, such as steel sheet preferably containing a first coating having certain corrosion resistant and adhesion promot ing characteristics, and applying thereto an outer coating of an organic resin containing a particulate metallic aluminum zinc alloy which is between 5 and 95 by weight aluminum, balance zinc. Preferably, the particle size of said alloy is no more than about 10 microns. Such product is ideally suited for the subse quent application of a cathodic electrophoretic primer coat, such as widely used in the automotive industry.
