# A motor vehicle with inclined seating arrangement.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a motor vehicle in which the passengers are located in a fish bone geometry, with their shoulders and heads in close relationship so as to obtain a compact arrangement at the passenger compartment center. This permits the provision of a vehicle having the best aerodynamic properties, both due to the reduction of the main section thereof with respect to the conventional motor vehi cles, and due to a better form factor particularly obtained also by spacing the passenger compartment bottom from the ground and locating the passenger legs in suitable lateral depressions provided in a location substantially aligned with and among the vehicle wheels.
