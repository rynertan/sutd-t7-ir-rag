## Description
It is accepted dogma that typically ovulation of a single, fertilisable ovum each menstrual cycle completes a course of oogenesis that began during fetal development. It is not known, however, why from among the thousands of follicles present from birth, only a relative few are recruited each cycle to grow while at the same time others remain at rest. It is also not known why from the host of follicles maturing in each ovary, typically only a single follicle escapes atresia and is selected to ovulate each cycle. Since the vast majority of follicles fall victim to atresia greater than 99 , understanding the selection of the follicle destined to ovulate is fraught with the inherent difficulty of studying the rare exception rather than the predominant rule. One must be extremely careful to distinguish follicle growth that culminates in ovulation gametogenic follicle growth from that ending in atresia. The latter stages of oogenesis in adults i.e., folliculogenesis are known to depend, to a large degree, on a complex interplay of hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary and ovary. However, even though much more is understood about these endocrine relationships today, what determines the fate of an individual follicle remains largely unknown. Since in higher primates both ovaries are functional, the maturation of a single follicle with the potential to ovulate brings with it the obvious concomitant of one active and one quiescent ovary each cycle. It is not known how just a single follicle matures to ovulation on only one ovary each cycle, even though both ovaries are perfused by a common systemic circulation. Three glycoprotein hormones, luteinizing hormone or LH , follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG act on the ovary to stimulate steroid synthesis and secretion. LH and FSH are secreted by the pituitary and together play a central role in regulating the menstrual cycle and ovulation. hCG is secreted by the developing placenta from the early stages of pregnancy and its role is to maintain steroid secretion by the corpus luteum, which is necessary to prevent ovulation during pregnancy and to preserve the conceptus during early pregnancy. In the normal cycle, there is a mid cycle surge in LH concentration which is followed by ovulation. An elevated estrogen level, which is brought about by the endogeneous secretion of LH and FSH, is required for the LH surge to occur. The estrogen mediates a positive feedback mechanism which results in the increased LH secretion. It is now known how to employ exogeneous hormonal stimulation by administering mixed human menopausal gonadotropins, i.e., a combination of FSH and LH, as a prelude to ovulation or follicle aspiration for oocyte collection in Administration of human menopausal gonadotropins to ovulatory monkeys produces familiar bilateral ovarian hyperstimulation with attendant super physiological elevations of circulating estradiol. Despite these elevated estrogen levels, the monkeys failed to manifest timely gonadotropin responses to estrogen positive feedback, i.e., stereotypically these normal, intact, cycling primates do not have the expected mid cycle like LH surges despite escalating levels of serum estradiol that usually exceed 400 pg ml during 12 days of human menopausal gonadotropin therapy. An absence of spontaneous LH surges has also been observed when human menopausal gonadotropin induced ovarian hyperstimulation occurs in post partum monkeys. These observations fit in with the frequent clinical finding that when endocrinologically normal patients are given human menopausal gonadotropins to increase the number of follicles ova available for It is well established that the appropriate application of mixed exogeneous gonadotropins has proved efficacious for ovulation induction or for multiple egg retrieval during It is the object of this invention to provide an improved method of inducing ovulation by the administration of exogeneous human menopausal gonadotropins which increases the likelihood of more uniform follicular maturation or ovulation and is therefore of particular use in connection with According to the present invention FSH which is substantially free of LH is used in the manufacture of a composition for use in a method of inducing ovulation in conjunction with a gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist which is administered in an amount sufficient to suppress endogeneous pituitary menopausal gonadotropin secretion. In addition, according to the present invention a gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist is used in the manufacture of a composition for use in a method of inducing ovulation by the administration of FSH in the substantial absence of LH. The compositions may contain both FSH and the gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist, but preferably the two components are in separate compositions. Further according to the present invention human chorionic gonadotropin is used in the manufacture of a composition for use in a method of inducing ovulation in conjunction with FSH substantially free of LH and a gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist. The compositions are used in the induction of follicular maturation or ovulation by the administration of FSH in the absence of exogeneous LH and are therefore employed in treating infertility syndrome. The individual variations in estrogen response to FSH are mitigated by the cojoint administration of FSH and the GnRH antagonist. It has been found that the administration of exogeneous FSH in the absence of exogeneous LH is capable of inducing the development of multiple ovarian follicles which are responsive to hCG. In this novel method of inducing ovulation FSH is used in the same quantities as in the conventional exogeneous FSH LH combinations. Generally, the amount of FSH administered daily to a woman being treated will be in the range of about 75 225 IU and preferably in the range of about 1.5 4.0 IU kg day. Intramuscular injection can be employed. In order to decrease the marked individual variability in response to human menopausal gonadotropin therapy, a gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist is administered in order to eliminate endogeneous pituitary FSH and LH secretion. Typical GnRH antagonists are described in Rees et al, J.Med. Chem., 17, 1016 1974 , Coy et al, Peptides 1976 Loffed Ed., Editions de L Universite de Bruxelle 1977 p.463, Beattie et al, J.Med.

Commun., 86, 1266 1979 and U.S. Patents 4,317,815 and 4,431,635, and include Ac pClPhe¹, pClPhe², DTrp³, DArg⁶, DAla¹⁰ GnRH HCl, D Phe² LHRH, D Phe², D phe⁶ LHRH, D Phe², Phe³, D Phe⁶ LHRH, D Phe², D Trp³, D Phe⁶ LHRH, D p F Phe D Ala⁶ LHRH, and Ac D Phe¹, D Phe², D Trp The GnRH antagonist is administered in an amount which is sufficient to suppress endogeneous gonadotropin secretion. In general, the average daily dosage will be in the range of about 1.0 3.0 mg per kg and preferably in the range of about 1.5 2.5 mg kg. Intramuscular injection can be employed. The amount of the antagonist and FSH will best be determined by the attending clinician for the individual being treated. This is particularly true for the GnRH antagonist since the various analogs have different potencies.

Figure 2 charts estradiol, LH and FSH concentration in intact cycling monkeys which have been treated with a GnRH antagonist and by human menopausal gonadotropin therapy as described in the following example. Figure 3 graphs estradiol, LH and FSH concentration in intact cycling monkeys to whom a GnRH antagonist and by FSH therapy has been administered as described in the following examples. Eleven adult female cynomolgus monkeys Counting the first day of spontaneous menses as cycle day 1, the monkeys were treated with 25 IU im of FSH twice daily according to three regimens. Group 1 received injections on cycle days 1 11 Group 2 on cycle days 1 4 and Group 3 on days 8 11. For all monkeys, laparoscopies were performed under ketamine anesthesia, beginning on the first day of FSH treatment and serially every 3 to 5 days thereafter to assess the status of ovarian follicular development. In order to test whether these FSH driven follicles could be ovulated, monkeys in Group 1 only received 1,000 IU im of hCG on day 12 and retrograde lavage of the fallopian tubes for egg collection 72 hours after hCG treatment was employed to determine whether ovulation had actually occurred. Daily femoral blood samples were collected beginning on day 1 of the cycle and continued for 40 days or until menstruation. Sera were frozen until radioimmunoassay of LH, FSH, 17β estradiol and progesterone. The injections of FSH on cycle days 1 11 induced dramatic and sustained elevations in serum FSH about 15 µg ml and estradiol about 500 pg ml . Concurrently, ovarian hyperstimulation was manifested by obvious multiple follicular growth 10 15 prominent follicles by cycle day 8 11 . Prior to hCG treatment, serum LH and progesterone remained at basal levels. Within 48 hours after HCG treatment, 1 3 ovulatory stigma were observed on each ovary. Mean serum progesterone and estradiol levels exceed 15 ng ml and 400 pg ml, respectively, in mid luteal phase, indicative of the collective secretory actions of multiple corpora lutea. That ovulation had actually occurred was indicated by the recovery of one or more eggs from the fallopian tubes of each female. The monkeys treated with FSH during only the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle demonstrated a prompt increase in serum FSH concentrations mostly exogeneous with mean levels near 15 µg ml on day 4. On discontinuation of FSH injections, circulating FSH levels declined precipitously, below the limits of detection in radio immunoassay cycle days 8 11 . Serum estradiol levels increased in parallel with the initial increase in circulating FSH, with mean peak values exceeding 300 pg ml on cycle days 4 6 but even so, no LH surges were observed. Serum progesterone levels remained basal until the onset of the luteal phase in the subsequent spontaneous ovulatory cycle day 24 2.4 . Laparoscopy prior to FSH treatment reveal no advanced follicular development, while on cycle day 5, both ovaries were enlarged with multiple vesicular follicles. Following withdrawal of FSH treatment, the ovaries gradually returned to normal size over the subsequent week. No ovulatory stigma appeared. Brief administration of FSH on cycle days 8 11 increased serum FSH levels similar to those found in Groups 1 and 2. Mean serum estradiol concentrations increased abruptly, but a spontaneous LH surge was present in only one of four monkeys. The follicular phase serum hormonal profiles for the solitary female were indistinguishable from those of an untreated ovulatory cycle. The foregoing results show that FSH can be administered alone to enhance the natural ovarian cycle. The GnRH antagonist Ac pClPhe¹,pClPhe², DTrp³, DArg⁶ , DAla¹⁰ GnRH HCl, was administered to 20 normal cynomolgus monkeys 1.0 mg kg day in order to eliminate endogeneous pituitary FSH and LH secretion. Superimposed on this treatment, 15 of the monkeys were administered a human menopausal gonadotropin preparation containing approximately equal amounts of FSH and LH and five monkeys were administered FSH only to stimulate ovarian follicular maturation. Control groups received either the combined exogeneous gonadotropins or FSH only 15 monkeys each group . All of the groups received a fixed regimen of gonadotropin therapy for seven consecutive days 25 IU day im, cycle days 3 9 followed by hCG 1,000 IU im on cycle day 10. It was observed that the variability in response to gonadotropin treatment was less in the group treated with the GnRH antagonist. The patterns of estradiol rise in serum and the appearance of the ovaries at laparotomy were more uniform when the endogeneous gonadotropin secretion was suppressed. Figures 2 and 3 show assay results. While both treatments suppressed the estrogen variability, only the regimen employing the GnRH antagonist and FSH in the absence of LH promoted maturation of multiple ovarian follicles and these follicles were ovulated by hCG with subsequent recovery of two cell embryos. This is the first time that ovarian follicular maturation has been demonstrated to be promoted by FSH in the absence of detectable levels of LH in serum. Ovulation was also achieved in 9 of the 15 control monkeys treated with only FSH.
