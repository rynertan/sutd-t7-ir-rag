# POWER BEAM FOR ROTATING STRUCTURAL MEMBER

## Abstract
A power beam converts a linear force into a torque. The beam is slideably positioned transverse to a structural member to be rotated and adjacent a hinged connection of the structural member to a frame. The beam is driven in a linear direction by a motive means such as a hydraulic cylinder, cable network or threaded shaft and actuation nut. A cable extends from its connection to the structural member at a set distance from the hinged connection, over the end of the slideable beam and thence to a bias means, typically a spring. To rotate the structural member, the slideable beam is driven transverse to the structural member to impart a force along the cable the spring travels to its limit and thereafter a significant force is applied to the structural member to rotate the structural member.
