## Description
Present systems for coherent optical fiber com munication have only limited information bandwidth and may suffer serious non linear distortions. Digital trans mission is currently the dominant mode for fiber optical communication. In order to utilize the large available information bandwidth, the current practice is to use higher and higher bid rates. However, for operation near the maximum repeater span, there appears to be a fundamental limit as to how fast or how short a pulse can be transmitted without causing Stimulated Brillouin Scattering SBS and other non linear phenomena. Conventional frequency division multiplexing FDM used in optical fiber communication OFC employs an in coherent optical source which is directly intensity modula ted by a multiplexed RF signal. Direct detection is used to recover the RF signals. These RF signals up to several hundred MHz are demodulated by standard RF techniques. This system has been widely used for multiple channel trans mission, normally over short distances up to 10 Km. How ever, due to serious intermodulations, this system is normally implemented using FM modulated RF channels. Since the intensity of the optical source laser diode is directly modulated by the multiplexed RF signals, the total infor mation bandwidth is limited by the frequency response of the laser diode. Presently, the modulation limit is on the order of several GHz. Until recently substantially all OFC systems were incoherent. A coherent heterodyne system using a single or multiple optical carriers has been suggested. Basically this system employs a single frequency laser as the transmitter, a single mode fiber as the transmission medium and a local oscillator as the receiver. For such a system a very stable semi conductor laser and optical fibers with stable polarization characteristics are required. When only a single carrier is employed, absolute frequency sta bility is not critical as long as the carrier can be tracked by the local oscillator. Initially, the local oscillator is tuned near the transmitter frequency by changing its temperature and injection current. The frequency of the local oscillator is then AFC controlled to track the trans mitter. If many carriers are used the frequency stability of the carriers must be greatly improved. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve narrowly spaced carriers of the re quired stability. Currently, such a system requires a minimum carrier separation of between 10 and 100 gigahertz. It is the object of the present invention to provide an optical fiber communication system with increased information carrying capacity or bandwidth. This object is attained as set forth in claim 1. Further advantageous aspects of the invention are claimed in the subclaims. The system according to the invention has the following advantages It is an optical fiber communication system for multichannel communication. It exhibits very high Bandwidth Distance Product BDP and reduces non linear distortion. The threshold of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering SBS is reduced so that more power can be used for transmission. The system is a coherent optical fiber communication system and can be used for simultaneous digital as well as analog information transmission. The system can have a minimum carrier frequency separation of less than one gigahertz, as desired. The closely spaced optical carriers can be heterodyne detected simultaneously with a single local oscillator. The channel frequencies can be further heterodyne detected using microwave techniques to minimize excess noise and to provide good channel separation. The system is capable of homodyne and PSK detection. The polarization state can be optimized for all carriers. The system can be used in conjunction with conventional Wavelength Division Multiplexing WDM systems to further expand the available information bandwidth. The invention will now be explained, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings. Optical fiber communication using a single mode fiber has been viewed as the preferred mode of operation since its inception in1966. A single mode fiber can be manufactured with zero dispersion in the 1.3 to 1.6 micrometer region. Such a fiber normally has a bandwidth exceeding 1000 gigahertz Km. In accordance with the present invention, frequency division multiplexing is provided for coherent optical fiber communication in which a plurality of separated optical car riers are employed. The optical carriers are closely spaced and can be used for simultaneous digital or analog infor mation transmission. Preferably, the range of frequency separation between the closely spaced optical carriers is from 100MHz to 300 GHz. However, very significantly, only the relative frequency, spacing or stability coherence between the carriers and a reference optical beam is main tained within required tolerances. The frequency of the reference optical beam and all the carriers are allowed to drift together. The maximum permissible drift rate is such that an optical local oscillator in the receiver can track the reference wave. The required relative stability or tolerance is dependent upon what type of modulation is used with the transmitting lasers. For ASK, the required stability should be such that the generated IF is within the IF filter band width. The stability is generally a small percentage of the IF frequency. Based on todays technology, for an IF of 1 GHz, the stability may be on the order of 50MHz, i.e., 5 or less. For FSK, additional consideration must be given to the slope of the discriminator. In order to obtain the maximum SNR discrimination, the two frequencies assuming two level transmission should be centered as closely as possible to the discriminator, therefore a tighter tolerance is needed. For the above example, a stability of 1 to 10 MHz may be necessary. For PSK, phase locking is necessary. The closely spaced optical carriers can be generated in various ways. One approach is to use a reference beam from a single mode laser diode whose fre quency and therefore the frequency of the system is stabi lized. The stability of the reference freqency should be consistent with that of the optical local oscillator. The frequency of the laser diode can be stabilized by using an AFC and by changing its temperature or injection current or both. The reference laser beam, or a part of it, is fre quency shifted by the desired amount. The frequency shifted beam is used to injection lock or frequency stabilize a transmitting laser, such as a laser diode. The transmitting laser can be modulated externally if desired and still maintain coherence with respect to the reference laser beam. Since only a small fraction of the output power from the reference laser is needed to injection lock a transmitting laser, the reference laser can be used to injection lock many transmitting lasers, each having a different frequency shift. This frequency shift can be accomplished by send ing the laser beam from the reference laser through a Traveling Wave Acousto Optical Modulator TWAOM . The fre quency of a laser beam has been shifted by as much as 13 gigahertz by using a TWAOM. Moreover, by cascading, even greater frequency shifts can be obtained. An alternative way of generating the multiple optical carriers is to injection lock a plurality of trans mitting lasers to the sidebands of an FM modulated injec tion laser. When an injection laser is modulated near its resonant frequency, a large FM modulation will result. If the index of the modulation is properly adjusted, a large number of sidebands are generated. For example, if the injection laser is modulated by 2 gigahertz near its resonant frequency, the laser beam will contain the 4, 2, 0, 2 and 4 gigahertz sidebands, with the 0th order rep resenting the unshifted injection laser frequency. There fore, if five transmitting lasers are selectively injection locked to the five sidebands, the frequency of the five transmitting lasers will be 2 gigahertz apart. However, it should be clearly understood that injection locking is only one way of generating the plurality of coherent closely spaced optical carriers, and that the present invention embraces techniques for stabilizing the frequencies between lasers without actually frequency or phase locking the same. Referring to Figure 1, a frequency assignment for the coherent FDM optical carriers in accordance with the present invention is designated as 10. A reference frequency fr having some arbitrary value is indicated at 12. The specific frequency of the reference wave 12 is unimportant as long as it is reasonably stable and can be frequency tracked by an optical local oscillator. The six channels for the optical carriers are indicated as 14, 16, 22, 24, 26 and 28, with each channel being sep arated by 2 gigahertz. That is, each carrier is associated with a bandwidth of 2 gigahertz minus some guarding bands . The first optical carrier 14 has a frequency 1 gigahertz above the reference frequency 12. The next optical carrier 16 has a frequency 3 gigahertz above the fre quency 12. These two optical carriers form a group of optical carriers or frequency band, designated as 18. Another frequency band is designated as 20. The band 20 includes four optical car riers. The first optical carrier 22 of this band 20 has a frequency 7 gigahertz above the reference frequency 12. The next optical carrier 24 has a frequency 9 gigahertz above the reference frequency 12. The third optical carrier 26 has a frequency 11 gigahertz above the reference frequency 12. Finally, the last optical carrier 28 has a frequency 13 gigahertz above the reference frequency 12. Although the assignment of these frequencies is somewhat arbitrary, they have been selected to minimize harmonic distortion during heterodyne detection. Further, with the channel frequencies selected as shown in Fig. 1, all possible intermodulations and the second harmonics fall between the carriers. The actual frequency used for generating the optical carriers, such as illustrated in Figure 1, need not be the same as the reference wave 12 illustrated in Figure 1, but can be located between the two bands 18 and 20 at 30 as indicated by the dashed line in Figure 1 and desig nated as fr . The six optical carriers 14, 16, 22, 24, 26 and 28 represented by the six channels in Fig. 1 have a bandwidth of 12 gigahertz. The next two possible frequency bands will extend from 27 to 53 and 110 to 210 gigahertz. These two frequency bands will provide an additional 65 channels. Thus, the total number of channels for the four frequency bands is 71 with a total bandwidth of 142 gigahertz. How ever, each channel propagates independently and has an independent bandwidth of 2 gigahertz. As previously mentioned, the coherent optical car riers in accordance with the present invention may be generated by optical frequency shifting or injection lock ing two or more lasers. The use of a TWAOM to shift a laser beam in bulk is well known. Recently efficient acousto optic Bragg diffraction in GaAs GaAlAs waveguide structures has been implemented. Injection locking of a laser to another laser beam has been widely used in many optical heterodyne detection systems. Referring to Figure 2, a coherent FDM transmitter in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in Opto Electronic Integrated Circuit OEIC form at 36 the components of the FDM transmitter are formed on an integrated chip or substrate 38. Implementation for the channel frequency assignments of the optical car riers 14, 16, 22, 24, 26 and 28 shown in Figure 1 is illus trated in Figure 2. The reference frequency fr , desig nated 30 in Fig. 1, is used as the actual reference fre quency in Figure 2. This reference frequency 30, shown as 5GHz in Fig. 1, is up shifted to produce the upper fre quency band 20 and down shifted to produce the lower fre quency band 18. The reference frequency 30 is produced by a master laser ML oscillator 40. A portion of the beam from the master laser 40 is deflected or frequency shifted by 2 gigahertz by a Surface Acoustic Wave transducer SAW 42 and is then directed by a curved waveguide 44 to a third transmitting laser 46 TL3 which is positioned above the master laser 40 in Fig. 2. The third transmitting laser 46 is injection locked to the frequency up shifted optical beam due to the coupling between the curved waveguide 44 and waveguide 48 of the third transmitting laser 46. A portion of the optical beam from the third transmitting laser 46 is also deflected by 2 gigahertz by SAW 50 and guided by curved waveguide 52 to injection lock a fourth transmitting laser TL4 54, positioned just above the third transmitting laser 46, as a result of the coupling between the curved waveguide 52 and waveguide 56 of the fourth transmitting laser 54. A portion of the optical beam from the fourth transmitting laser 54 is also deflected by 2 gigahertz by a SAW 58 and guided by curved waveguide 60 to injection lock the frequency of a fifth transmitting laser TL5 62 positioned just above the fourth transmitting laser 54. Again, the injection lock ing is accomplished as a result of the coupling between the curved waveguide 60 and a waveguide 64 of the fifth transmitting laser 62. A portion of the fifth transmitting laser 62 is also deflected by 2 gigahertz by a SAW 66 and guided by a curved waveguide 68 to a sixth transmitting laser TL6 70 which is positioned just above the fifth transmitting laser 62. The sixth transmitting laser 70 is injection locked to the frequency up shifted optical beam in curved waveguide 68 as a result of the coupling between the curved waveguide 68 and waveguide 72 of the sixth transmitting laser 70. Similarly, the second transmitting laser TL2 has its output beam phase locked to a frequency down shifted 2 gigahertz from the frequency of the master laser 40 as a result of SAW 76. The shifted optical output from the master laser 40 is guided by curved waveguide 78 the injection lock the second transmitting laser TL2 74 to the down shifted frequency as a result of the coupling between the curved waveguide 78 and waveguide 80 of the second transmitting laser 74. Finally, a portion of the output of the second transmitting laser 74 is fre quency down shifted by 2 gigahertz by SAW 82 and guided to a first transmitting laser TL1 84 curved waveguide 86. The phase shifted portion of the second transmitting laser 74 injection locks the first transmitting laser 84 to the down shifted frequency due to the coupling be tween the curved waveguide 86 and waveguide 88 of the first transmitting laser 84. Thus, the optical carriers 4GHz, 2GHz, 2GHz, 4GHz, 6GHz and 8GHz are generated from the reference beam fr indicated as 0 GHz in Figure 2. However, this is equivalent to assuming that the actual reference fre quency fr being used is 5GHz, by up shifting and down shifting portions of the reference wave generate the optical carriers 1, 3, 7, 9, 11 and 13 gigahertz as seen in Figure 1. These optical carrier outputs from the transmitting lasers TL1, TL2 and TL3 through TL6 are combined to form a multiplexed optical output by, e.g., a star coupler 90. The star coupler 90 includes a plurality of straight and curved waveguide portions which are aligned with and funnel the outputs of the transmitting lasers TL1 TL6 to a trunk portion 91 where the straight and curved waveguide portions join to provide a single output beam for coupling to a single mode optical fiber 102, see Figures 3 and 5. Advantageously, the output from the star coupler 90 is first amplified by an optical amplifier 92, which may be part of the integrated circuit 36, prior to coupling to the single mode optical fiber 102. It is normally difficult to optically separate optical carriers spaced very close together. However, since they are coherent relative to one another, they can be readily heterodyne detected using a single optical local oscillator. The optical heterodyne detection will provide a first broadband intermediate frequency in the microwave region. Thereafter, an electronic heterodyne detection using adjustable coupling capacitors, microwave local oscillators and intermediate frequency filters can then be used to electronically separate the frequencies corresponding to the optical channels. Referring to Figure 3, a receiver for optical heterodyne detection and first broadband microwave pro duction is generally illustrated as 100. The output from a single mode optical fiber 102 is focused by a first lens 104 and applied to a beam splitter 106. An optical local oscillator 108 is tuned to track the first optical carrier 14 in Fig. 1. The output of the optical local oscillator 108 is focused by a lens 110 and applied to the beam splitter 106. The output from the beam splitter 106 is directed to a focusing lens 112 which focuses the optical beam from the beam splitter 106 on a photo detector or photo diode 114. For the example illustrated in Figure 1, the local oscillator 108 will be set 1 gigahertz be low the first carrier as indicated at 12 in Figure 1. Automatic frequency control is then used in conjunction with the local oscillator 108 to provide the frequency tracking. Since the other optical carriers are coherent with the first optical carrier 14, the beat frequencies for all the optical carriers form an orderly spectrum from 1 to 13 GHz, including 6 frequency channels at 1, 3, 7, 9, 11 and 13 gigahertz. Thus the resulting broadband first intermediate frequency will include 6 relatively narrow frequency channels designated as 14, 16, 22, 24, 26 and 28 in Figure 1. A low loss resonant strip line or transmission line 116 is used as the load for the photo detector 114 which is coupled to one end 117. Since a high driving point impedance is desirable, an odd number quarter wave resonant strip line 116 is employed. If the resonant strip line 116 is a quarter wave for 1 GHz, it will also be odd quarter waves for the higher odd numbered frequencies 3, 7, 9, 11 and 13 GHz. The total length of the resonant strip line 116 in the example given is approximately 50 millimeters. A termination or shorting capacitor 118 is coupled to the end 119 of the resonant strip line 116 opposite the photo detector 114. A trimming inductor 121 is also coupled to the end 119 of the resonant strip line 116. Adjustable coupling capacitors 120, 122, 124, 126 and 128 are posi tioned along the resonant strip line 116 at the proper location to couple out the respective optical channel frequencies as indicated in Figure 3. Referring to Figure 4, the standing wave patterns for the various optical carrier frequencies are illustrated in the graph designated as 150. The standing wave pattern for the 1GHz carrier frequency is designated 152 the standing wave pattern for the 3 GHz carrier frequency is designated 154 the standing wave pattern for the 7GHz carrier frequency is designated 156 the standing wave pattern for the 9 GHz carrier frequency is designated 158 the standing wave pattern for the 11 GHz carrier frequency is designated 160 and the standing wave pattern for the 13 GHz carrier frequency is designated 162. Many of the nodes which correspond to the maximum amplitude of these standing waves are connected to the coupling capacitors 120 through 128 in Fig. 3. The dashed lines indicating the node position at which the coupling connections are made for the respective standing wave for the 1 and 3 GHz, 13 GHz, 11 GHz, 9 GHz and 7GHz carrier frequences, which are designated as 164, 166, 168, 170 and 172, respectively. These different carrier frequencies are selectively coupled out at the nodes 174, 176, 178, 180 and 182 where the am plitude of the respective standing wave is at a maximum. The separated or decoupled carrier frequencies can be fur ther second heterodyne detected electronically and am plified as desired. The coupling capacitors 120 128 for each frequency are adjusted so that the resonant strip line 116 is properly loaded at the different frequencies and the Q for each fre quency is close to its optimum for selectivity and informa tion bandwidth. Advantageously, using a transmission line or resonant strip line 116 as the load for the photo diode 114 enables the capacitance of the photo diode 114 to be neutralized by inductance trimming or by adjusting the length of the resonant strip line 116 or both. Referring to Figure 5, a more detailed schematic of the optical and electronic heterodyne receiver is illustrated generally as 200 like numbered elements from Figure 3 are given the same numerical designation in Figure 5. The six optical carrier frequencies or channels present in the transmission or resonant strip line 116 are coupled out using a low pass filter 202 for the 1 and 3 GHz chan nels and band pass filters 204, 206 and 208 and 210 for the 13 GHz, 11 GHz, 9 GHz and 7 GHz channels, respectively. The low pass filter 202 is coupled to resonant strip line 212 and to a 1 GHz microwave receiver front end 214 which receives its local oscillator input from another strip line 216. An appropriate IF output is obtained from output line 218. The strip line 212 is coupled by an ad justable capacitor to another resonant strip line 220 which is coupled to a 3 GHz microwave receiver 222 which receives its local oscillator input along strip line 224. The IF normally the same as the 1 GHz channel output is obtained from output line 226. The band pass filter 204 is coupled to a resonant strip line 228 which is electronically coupled at its opposite end to a microwave receiver 230 for 13 GHz. The microwave receiver 230 receives its local oscillator input from strip line 232 and provides an IF output on output line 234. Like wise band pass filters 206, 208 and 210 are coupled to resonant lines 236, 238, 240, respectively, which are elec trically coupled to microwave receivers 242, 244 and 246, respectively, which are tuned to 11 GHz, 9GHz and 7 GHz, respectively. The microwave receivers 242, 244 and 246 receive their local oscillator inputs on strip lines 248, 250 and 252, respectively, and provide IF outputs on out put lines 254, 256 and 258, respectively. In implementing the system of the present inven tion, a reference optical wave, e.g., as shown in Figure 1 at 30, is utilized to generate a plurality of optical car riers which are coherently related to the frequency of the reference optical wave and therefore to one another. The optical carriers are all allowed to drift, but the relative coherence between the optical carriers and the reference optical wave must remain stable within required tolerances. In accordance with the embodiment in Figure 2, a reference optical wave from a laser diode 40 is up and down shifted by a plurality of SAWs to provide a plurality of optical carrier waves having fixed or stable frequencies relative to the reference optical wave. This may be accomplished by injection locking or optical frequency shifting the frequency of the reference optical wave to provide a multi plicity of carrier frequencies. In Figure 2, injection locking of a plurality of transmitting lasers TL1 through TL6 is employed and a star coupler 90 is utilized to com bine the outputs of the transmitting lasers to form a single multiplexed optical output beam. The output from the star coupler 90 is optically coupled to an optical amplifier 92 to provide any necessary amplification as a result of any loss in the optical carriers as a result of their transmission through and combination by the star coupler 90. The output of the optical amplifier 92 is coupled to a single mode optical fiber 102 as such shown in Figs. 3 and 5. The optical carriers may be used for simultaneous digital or analog information transmission, as desired. This may be accomplished by applying digital or analog information to a specific optical carrier fre quency. As shown in Figs. 3 and 5, the multiplexed optical output from the single mode fiber 102 is optically heter odyne detected with the local oscillator 108 tuned to track the reference frequency by combining the output from the optical fiber 102 and local oscillator 108 at the beam splitter 106 and directing the same to the photo detector 114 which is coupled to the quarter wave resonant strip line 116 to provide a microwave spectrum. The resonant strip line 116 is constructed to facilitate coupling out the assigned optical carrier frequencies. As shown in Fig. 1, the assigned optical carrier frequencies, for example, are 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13 GHz and represent the two frequency bands 18 and 20. The different optically heter odyne detected frequencies are coupled at the nodes 174 182 along the strip line 116 where the amplitude of the resulting standing waves is at a maximum, see the inter relationship between Figs. 3 and 4. The channel frequencies may be further second or electronically heterodyne detected and amplified as desired. To accomplish this, as indicated in Figure 5, a low pass filter 202 and band pass filters 204 through 210 are util ized in conjunction with additional strip lines 212, 220, 228 and 236 240 and receivers front end 222, 214, 230 and 242 246 to provide the desired IF frequency outputs on lines 218, 226, 234, 254, 256, and 258. For example, the possible frequencies for the receivers from inputs 224, 216, 232, 248, 250 and 252 shown in Figure 5, for a second intermediate frequency of 2.5 GHz, would be 3.5 and 5.5 GHz for the 1 and 3 GHz frequency channels, 4.5 and 6.5 GHz for the 7 and 9 GHz channels and 13.5 and 15.5 GHz for the 11 and 13 GHz channels. Advantageously, the wavelength of the frequency separation for the optical carriers of the present inven tion is only a small fraction of a nanometer. Therefore, with such small wavelength separations the present inven tion is compatible with conventional WDM systems. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made in the present invention to provide closely spaced coherent optical carriers bu utilizing injection locked single mode laser diodes and acousto optical modulators as well as by using other tech niques in which the frequencies between the lasers can be stabilized without actually frequency or phase locking the same such systems are considered to be within the scope and spirit of the present invention as described in the specification and defined in the appended claims.
