## Description
The present invention relates to an adjustable support for a smoke or fume exhauster and the like. More particularly, this invention relates to a support of said type having structural and functional properties such as to assure a very high flex ibility of employment. Moreover, the support according to the present invention, in addition to be made of a modular structure, gives the possibility of keeping the orientation of the suction hood in the desired position, even in the case of moving the suction arm and shifting the same in any direction and through any angle. Smoke or fume exhausters and the like are increasingly employed at the present time in the industrial field. There are many devices commercially available for serving the purposes pointed out above, but it is to be observed that such devices involve a number of drawbacks which make their use troublesome in some cases, and which anyway quite often make their use inconvenient. For instance, the device disclosed in the Italian patent 967309 BILL NEDERMAN provides a supporting structure inside the flexible suction tube, said structure being centrally artic ulated, as well as articulated at the connection point with the suction box. It is well evident that a structure provided inside the suction tube gives rise to a number of problems and drawbacks because of the fact that the material so sucked comes in contact with the supporting structure and deposits on the same, so as to compromise possibly the good performance of the device, ad in addition because of load losses which occur, so that it is necessary to oversize the suction system. On the contrary, the device that is the object of the Ita lian patent No. 1058789 in the same of CORAL S.a.s., provides a structure made up of two or more rigid tube members which are articulated at their connections and whose actions counteracting the friction forces at the connection points are obtained, for the first arm, through a large spring fastened to the connection end of the exhauster and to the articulation point, whereas no such action is provided for the next arms, so that the structure is quite heavy and hard to move. Said device does not allow to keep the orientation of the suction hood unaltered when the po sition of the arm is changed. The adjustable support according to the present invention aims at obviating these and other drawbacks by providing a de vice which consists of a modular structure comprising two or more articulated parallelograms, whose lower arm is the same suc tion tube, said parallelograms being articulated centrally by means of a four points transmission plate which allows said parallelogram to close completely so that the articulating ca pacity of the support is increased. The supporting action is obtained in the support according to the present invention through springs, the frictions provided at the various hinge points having the function of compensating the spring actions. Moreover, the support according to the present invention allows the orientation of the suction hood to be kept unaltered also when the arm is moved. A further object of the present invention is that of sup plying a double friction articulation system of the suction hood, so that the orientation of such system keeps unaltered unless said hood is directly acted upon. Thus, it is a specific object of the present invention that of supplying an adjustable support for smoke or fume exhausters and the like, said support being characterized in that it com prises parallelogram means, each parallelogram being made up of rod means and a rigid suction tube, pairs of compensating springs which are associated respectively to one of said parallelograms, lenghts of flexible hose upstream the first parallelogram, be tween the two adjacent parallelograms and between the last par allelogram and the suction hood, the coupling between said adjacent parallelograms being realized by means of four points transmission plates having a lower arm of a length longer than the diameter of said suction tube. According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the parallelograms of said support are each made up of two upper rods and of a rigid suction tube, which latter performs the functions of the lower rod. According to a further particularly preferred embodiment of the support according to the present invention, the compensat ing springs associated to each of said parallelograms are fas tened at the upper part to a point on the vertical line of the lower hinge point of the parallelogram so as to avoid the pres ence of a residual angle which, in the position of maximum extension of the spring, would alter the equilibrium state of the whole system. Again according to the present invention, two inverted U shaped sections or inverted channels can be provided which are laterally fastened to said rigid tube through bolts, which gove a higher stiffness to the structure so consisting of the same together with said rigid tube one end of said compensating spring pairs being centrally coupled to said U shaped sections, and the respective articulation points being hinged at the two end. Again according to the present invention, advantageously a double friction system is provided at the end of the parallelogram where the suction hood is coupled at the articulation point of said upper rods, of said rigid tube as well as of said suction hood, said friction system experiencing between the upper rod and the rigid pipe a friction lower than the friction occurring between the rigid pipe and the articulation point of said hood, so that motions given to the two parallelograms as a whole do not give rise to motions of said hood. More particularly, an angle section or L shaped rod can be provided which is hinged at the upper part with an upper rod of said parallelogram, at the center position, on the connection system between the rigid pipe, the length of the flexible hose between the rigid tube and the hood, and, at the lower part, on an articulation plate of the hood itself, the friction system of lower friction action being provided at said central hinge, the friction system of higher friction action being provided at said lower hinge, and a similar system being provided between the other upper rod of the parallelogram and the articulation point of said hood. Thus, once the desired position of the hood has been set manually, the suction arm can be acted upon as desired without changing the angular orientation of the hood. Further according to the present invention, a rod is provided between said four point transmission plates, which rod is trans versal and fastened at the connection point of said compensating springs associated to the parallelogram, such rod transmitting in that way a fraction of the present stress. According to a further embodiment of the support of the present invention, two such parallelograms are provided, in series. The present invention is disclosed in the following for illustrative and not for limitative purposes, with particular reference to a preferred embodiment of the same which is illus trated in the enclosed drawings, wherein With reference now to the enclosed drawings, it can be observed that an exhauster 1 of the known type bears at the upper part a revolving or rotating connection member 2 to which the suction tube is attached through a length of a flexible hose 3 ending with a bush 4. The suction tube in addition is made up of a first rigid tube 5, a second length of a flexible hose 6, a second rigid tube 7 and a third length of a flexible hose 8. At the end of the hose 8 the small suction hood 9 is provided. The rigid tube 5, together with the two upper rods 10 and 10 , constitutes the first parallelogram which, at its lower end is fastened to two plates 11, 11 . Such fastening is of a direct type at the point 12 and 12 as regards the upper rods 10 and 10 , whereas the fastening action occurs through the inter position of a plate 13 as regards the tube 5. Friction members are provided at points 12, 12 and 14, 14 where hinges are placed, said friction members being interposed between the single members hinged at said points and movable with respect to each other. The second parallelogram, similarly to the first one, is made up of the rigid tube 7 and of two upper rods 15 and 15 . Said rods 15, 15 are hinged at 16 and 16 , two plates 17 and 17 , hinged at 18, 18 , beginning at said points 16, 16 . Moreo ver, two plates 10 and 19 rigidly connected to the rigid tube 7 at points indicated with references 20 and 21 are hinged at the points 18, 18 . A shaped plate 22 is also hinged at the points 18, 18 , which plate is connected to the small suction hood 9 through the rod 23 which is articulate at point 24, the articulated joint 25 and the L shaped rod 26, so as to control the motions of said hood. As a consequence, a double friction system is provided at the articulation joint 18, 18 so as to cause the motions of the articulated parallelograms assembly to be independent of the motions of the small suction hoods. Thus, once the position of the small hood 9 has been fixed, all sequential motions of the suction tube will not change the inclination of said hood, because of the characteristics of said articulated parallelogram. To that aim, friction systems will be provided between the plates 17, 19 and 17 , and 19 , which systems exert a friction force lower than those provided between the plates 17, 17 and 22. The ori entation of the small hood 9 will be fixed manually and inde pendently of the motions of the suction tube, that is, independently of the rotation about points indicated with reference 18, 18 as regards the vertical motions, about point 24 as regards the horizontal motions, and about point 25 as regards rotatory mo tions. Two L shaped rods being fastened at the upper parts to the rods 15 and 15 , centrally with respect to the coupling collar between the tube 7 and the flexible hose 8, or to the analogous coupling system, and at the lower parts to the plate 22. The friction system with higher friction force will be arranged at the lower hinge point, whereas the system with lower friction value will be arranged at the central hinge point. Two transmission plates 27, 27 with four points are pro vided at the point of the central articulation joint between the two parallelogram systems. Said four points transmission plates 27, 27 allow the parallelogram assembly to close com pletely. The rods 10, 10 are hinged at points indicated with refer ences 28, 28 , whereas the rods 15, 15 are hinged at points 29, 29 . The two rigid pipes 5 and 7 are hinged in their turn at the points 30, 30 and 31, 31 through two pairs of plates 32, 32 and 33, 33 which are rigidly connected to the same. In order to male the whole parallelogram assembly close completely, it is necessary to respect a constraint in the structure to be realized, said contraint deriving from the fact the arm 34 of the plate 27, and in a similar way the arm 34 of the plate 27 , has to be longer than the diameter of the suction pipe. A first pair of compensating springs 35, 35 is provided between the plates 11, 11 and a central collar 36 on the tube 5, on which said springs are fastened at the points 37 and 37 . A second pair of springs 38, 38 in provided between the central collar 39 on the pipe 7, on which the transmission plates 27, 27 are fastened at the points 40, 40 . It can be observed that the springs 35, 35 are fastened to the plates 11, 11 at points 41, 41 on the vertical through the hinge points 14, 14 , and in the same way the springs 38, 38 are fastened to said transmission plates at points 42, 42 and not at the hinge points 29, 29 . The arrangement of the coupling point of said springs 38 and 38 outside the friction system point is suggested by the fact that in such a way the return force caused by the residual angular displacement present is avoided, which force would not allow to keep the equilibrium state under maximum extension conditions of the spring. A structure of the kind disclosed above, in which the pa rallelogram properties are exploited, also allows to obtain a constant deflection of the spring because a progressive compen sation caused by the reduction of the angular displacement corresponds to an increased extension of the springs. Moreover, a rod 43 is provided between the two transmission plates 27 and 27 , more exactly between the two coupling points 42 and 42 of the springs 38, 38 , which rod, by acting as a strut, transmits a fraction of the stress. The present invention has been disclosed with particular reference to some specific embodiments of the same for illustra tive and not for limitative purposes, and it is to be understood that modifications and changes can be introduced in the same by those who are skilled in the art without departing from the object and scope of the invention for which a priority right is claimed.
