# A shelf having selectable orientation.

## Abstract
A shelf adapted to be easily mounted to or removed from a vertical surface by a bracket has a generally L shaped cross section defining a horizontal base portion and a verti cal leg portion. A first mounting element is disposed on the leg portion adjacent the juncture of the leg portion and base portion for engaging the bracket. A second mounting ele ment is disposed adjacent the distal edge of the leg portion for engaging the bracket wherein one of the first and second mounting mechanisms is engaged with the bracket and the other is engaged with the wall. When the second mounting element engages the bracket, the shelf has a generally L shaped appearance and a generally inverted L orientation when the first mounting element engages the bracket where by the orientation of the shelf is selectable. The bracket preferably includes a longitudinal channel which is coexten sive with the shelf for supporting the latter.
