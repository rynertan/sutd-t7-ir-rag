## Description
PROCESS FOR DEACTIVATING AND NEUTRALIZING POLYMERIZATION CATALYSTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the production of polymeric materials catalysts are employed in the polymerization processes.In order to prevent continued polymerization downstream of the reactor s , the catalyst is usually deactivated at some point after the desired reaction. Such catalysts may be acids or produce acids upon deactivation. Such acid is corrosive in nature to process equipment and detrimental to product properties if not adequately neutralized. Exemplary of processes employing components which require deactivation are polymerization processes using halogen containing catalysts which remain in the polymer, for example, the Ziegler catalysts used in the polymerization of olefins in slurry, solution and high pressure processes. These catalysts require deactivation to prevent further polymerization as well as, in some instances, neutralization of the acidic moieties to obtain good quality products. Normally deactivation of the transition metal containing catalyst is done following completion of the reaction but prior to separation of the polymer from the reaction medium. Often HC1 or other hydrogen halide is produced by reaction of the catalyst and or support with the deactivator and or water contained therewith. It is preferable that such hydrogen halide is also neutralized by the catalyst deactivator, thereby reducing or eliminating subsequent corrosion to process equipment. Compositions of the present invention will also be effective in deactivating Lewis acid, Bronsted acid, metal alkyl catalysts, and the like, for example, aluminum chloride used for the production of ethyl benzene, sulfuric acid used in the synthesis of polyesters, zinc chloride used in the vulcanization of neoprene rubber and aluminum alkyls used in the preparation of a olefins such as 1 octene. Most conventional catalyst deactivators e.g., water, alcohols, amines, and carboxylic acids, besides forming corrosive hydrogen halides also can be carried over in the product and recycle systems if not removed. For example, Machon et al. U.S. 4,150,609 discloses the use of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts of carboxylic acids to deactivate theZiegler catalyst in a high pressure, high temperature process for polyethylene. However, calcium stearate is known to cause problems during polymer processing by plating out out on chill rolls and the stearic acid formed by the neutralization of HC1 or other hydrogen halide from catalyst residues is corrosive to processing equipment. Therefore it would be advantageous to have available a material which would deactivate the catalyst and tie up or scavenge such halogen or acidic components whenever produced. Thus it would be particularly advantageous to employ a catalyst deactivation agent which will not carry over in the recycle stream, which itself will neutralize the hydrogen halide when and if produced, and which would not later plate out or produce detrimental by products. Furthermore, such deactivation agent should have little or no effect on polymer properties at levels sufficient to deactivate the catalyst or neutralize acidic components.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Suitable catalyst deactivation agents and acid scavengers employed herein are aluminate compositions of the general of formula AxaB1 xb OH yCzc.nH2O weherein A andB are each one or more metal elements having valences of 1 or 2 and 2 or 3 respectively z 0 to ax b l x y c x has a value of from 0 to 1, y has a value of from 2 to about ax b l x cz n has a value from 0 to about 1 C is an anion having a valence of 1, 2 or 3 such as, for example, CO3 , HCO3 , PO4 3, HPO4 , H2PO4 , SO4 ,HSO4 ,S ,HS , SO3 2, S2O4 2, S2O2 2, S2 2, CN , C2 2, CN , C2 2, I3 ,HPO3 2, H2P2O5 2, NH2 , NH2 , NHOH , N2H3, NO2 , ClO2 ,ClO, O , F , C1 , Br , I , RCO2, and R COO 22, whereinR represents alkyl or aryl moieties.These compositions can be essentially pure compounds or mixtures of compounds which are generally formed under basic conditions and may contain certain amounts of inorganic impurities e.g. BOx OH a 2x, A OH a, B OH b . Furthermore, these compositions may be modified by thermal treatment, i.e.heating above 2000C and preferably at 4000C to 1200 C.Their activity is usually reduced as the temperature is increased. Such treatment may be necessary to moderate the hydroxyl activity for certain applications, for example, as a stabilizer in vinylidene chloride polymers or copolymers. Particularly, suitable compositions include the metal aluminates described in U.S. Patents 4,284,762 4,299,759 4,379,882 4,342,353 4,348,296 4,348,297 4,392,961 4,392,979 4,392,980 and 4,400,431. Alternatively, a product resulting from the surface coating of the compositions with surface active agents to improve dispersibility, can be employed in the present invention. Suitable anionic surface active agents include, for example, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts of higher fatty acids of the formulaRCOOM and RCOO 2M in which R is an alkyl group having 3 to 40 carbon atoms and M represents an alkali or alkaline earth metal atom alkylsulfates of the formulaROSO3M ana ROSO3 2M in which R and M are as defined above alkylsulfonates of the formula RSO3M and RSO3 2M in which R and M are as defined above alkylarylsulfonates of the formula R aryl SO3M and R aryl SO3 2M in whichR and M are as defined above and the aryl group represents phenyl, naphthyl, tolyl, etc. and sulfosuccinic ester salts expressed by the formulaEMI4.1 in which R and M are as defined above. Also suitable are certain phosphate salts of the general formulas ROPO3 M, ROPO3 M2, RO 2PO2 M, and RO 2PO2 2M, where R and M are as defined above. Organic acids may also be used as the surface coating agent. Thus, compounds corresponding to the formulas RCOOH, ROSO2OH, RSO2OH, RPO OH 2, and RO 2POOH can be used in which R may be any alkyl and or aryl group, as defined above, which produces a stable acid. Such acids often improve dispersibility of the inorganic composition. Specific examples of anionic surfactants include calcium stearate, sodium stearate, potassium stearate, sodium oleate, magnesium oleate, potassium oleate, sodium palmitate, potassium palmitate, calcium laurate, sodium laurate, potassium laurate, sodium laurylbenzenesulfonate, potassium octadecylsulfate, sodium laurylsulfonate and disodium 2 sulfoethyl a sulfostearate, calcium stearyl phosphate, disodium laural phosphate, and potassium distearyl phosphate. Specific examples of organic acid surfactants include stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, benzoic acid, ethyl hexanoic acid, and mixtures of these and other organic aids. Exemplary catalysts employed in a olefin polymerization and effectively deactivated by the process of the present invention include Ziegler Natta catalysts as described by John Boor, Jr., in ZIEGLER NATTACATALYSTS AND POLYMERIZATIONS, 1979, Academic Press,Inc. and in U.S. Patnets 4,198,315 4,319,011 2,846,425 4,124,532 3,989,878 4,088,812 and 3,541,074. The halogen can be a portion of the active catalyst or the support such as a magnesium chloride supported catalyst. Other polymerization catalysts which can be deactivated by the process herein include the inorganic oxide supported chromium catalysts such as those described in U.S. Patents 2,825,721 4,169,925 4,199,773 and 4,053,435. Other examples of resins containing halogens and or acidic components in this invention include thermoplastic resins produced by using catalysts containing halogens and or acidic components such as boron trifluoride, tin tetrachloride, sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid and containing halogen and or acidic subcomponents derived from these catalysts, for example, styrene resins such as polystyrene, AS resin acrylonitrile styrene copolymer , ABS resin acrylonitrilejbutadiene styrene copolymer , BS resin butadiene styrene copolymer , acrylic resins such as polyacrylates and methacrylic resins such as polymethacrylates halogen containing thermoplastic vinyl resins such as vinyl chloride polymer or copolymers such as vinyl chloride vinyl acetate resin, vinylidene polymer or copolymers, fluororethylene polymers or copolymer and polymer blends contaning vinyl chloride resins chlorine or fluorine containing rubbers such as chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, chloroprene and chlorinated isobutylene rubber and fluorinated rubber and halogen containning thermoplastic resins such as post chlorinated vinyl chloride polymer or copolymers, polytetrafluoroethylene, fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer, polychlorotrifluoroethylene acetate containing thermoplastic resins such as polyvinyl acetate or ethylenevinylacetate copolymer, and blends of these resins with each other or with other resins. The compound may be conveniently injected into the polymer at the point where the polymer exits the reactor, usually together with antioxidants and or other additives and or other polymers if a blend of polymers is desired. However, the compound can be added at any place desired after the reactor system or the last of any reactor series or reaction zones when a plurality thereof is employed, i.e, at any point downstream of the reactors including a melt extruder, where good dispersion of the compound throughout the polymer can be accomplished. In the practice of this invention, the composition is used in an amount of 0.01 to 5, preferably 0.01 to 2, more preferably 0.01 to 1.0, and especially preferably 0.05 to 1.0 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of polymer. It is preferable that the composition is usually slurried, dispersed or milled in a suitable inert diluent which is compatible with the polymer.Also, the suspendability of the composition in the inert diluent is improved when the particle size is very small, i.e., less than 20 microns pom , especially less than five microns for maximum reactivity and use in film applications. In addition, suitable suspending agents may also be used in an amount that is less than 10 by weight relative to the inorganic composition. The particle size of the composition should also be small enough as not to be detrimental to polymer properties. Especially important is film clarity which is affected by the perceivable particle size of the inorganic composition. Typically a particle size of less than 20 microns, especially less than five microns, depending upon the type of polymer and film thickness is acceptable. Suitable methods to achieve particle or agglomerate size distribution less then twenty microns include conventional ball milling wet or dry , vibratory milling, jet milling and similar methods, with or without milling aids. Wet vibratory milling or jet milling with size separation and recycle, are preferred when a very small particle size i.e. less than five microns is desired, for example in polyethylene which is to be ultimately used to prepare films. Milling aids, as discussed below, are also helpful. Reactor conditions, post treatment and aging, or the use of flocculants can also affect crystallite agglomeration. The deactivation of catalysts for polymerization or copolymerization reactions to which the present invention is directed is generally carried out continuously. Therefore, the deactivator compound is most conveniently injected into the reaction mixture at the point where the polymer solution exits the reactor, usually together with antioxidants, other additives and or other polymers if a blend of polymers is desired.However, the compound can be added at any place desired which is after the reactor system, i.e. the last of any reactor series or reaction zones when a plurality thereof is employed, as well as to any vessel for separating the polymer from the reaction medium. The compositions of the present invention may also be added to the polymer at any point downstream of the reactors , e.g. to the separators or in batch operations after the reaction has progressed to the desired degree, where good dispersion of the compound throughout the polymer can be accomplished to improve the color whiteness and increased neutralization of acidic components. The deactivation of polyolefin polymerization catalysts is advantageously employed with polymerization processes conducted at a temperature of from 500C to 3000C and a pressure of 150 psig 1.1 MPa to 25000 psig 170 MPa . Further, in the case of polyethylene and copolymers of polyethylene, the processes commercially practiced are slurry, solution and high pressure reactions using stirred autoclave or tubular reactors singularly or in series. In the polymerization reaction it is, of course, possible to use known processes for regulating the molecular weight of the polymers, or improving the properties of the resulting products by adding suitable transfer agents or other additives into the polymerization reactor, or at the outlet or some point downstream. Examples of additives conventionally found in the final polymer blends are antioxidants such as 2,6 di t butyl p cresol, 2,5, di t butyl hydroquinone, 2,2 methylenebis 4 methyl 6 t butylphenol , 4,41 thio bis 6 5 butylphenol , 4,4 thiobis 6 t butyl m cresol , and octadecyl 3 3 , 5 di t butyl 41 hydroxyphenyl propionate ultraviolet absorbers such as 2 hydroxy4 octoxybenzophenone, 2 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl benzotriazole and ethyl 2 cyano 3,3 diphenylacrylate antistatic agents such as pentaerythritol monostearate, sorbitan monopalmitate, polyethylene oxide and carbowax lubricants such as calcium stearate, zinc stearate, butyl stearate and ethylenebis stearamide plasticizers such as dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, olefic acid esters, phosphoric acid esters, waxes, and liquid paraffin coloring agents such as carbon black, phthalocyanine, quinacridone, indoline, azo pigments, titanium oxide and red iron oxide and fillers such as asbestos, glass fibers, talc, mica, wallastonite, calcium silicate, aluminum silicate and calcium carbonate. The amounts of these additives can be selected as desired. For example, the amounts based on the weight of the olefin resin are typically 0.01 to 1 for antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers, and antistatic agents, 0.1 to 5 for coloring agents and lubricants 0.1 to 10 for plasticizers and 1 to 50 for fillers. Other polymer forming processes which can advantageously employ the compositions of the present invention are those which employ halide containing catalysts which do not normally require deactivation but which release halogen atoms as a result of process conditions and or lose small amounts of halogen from the backbone during processing. Such processes are those for producing vinyl halide resins, chlorinated polyethylene, and vinyl vinylidene halide resins. The compounds of the present invention can be added following final reaction prior to pelletizing and or powder formation as well as during melt extrusion to scavenge halide.In some instances compounds have been found to dehydrohalogenate or dehalogenate the backbone and it is necessary to employ the less active forms of the compounds such as those compounds formed by heating above 2000C and preferably at 4000C to 12000C. The following examples are illustrative of the present invention. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight. General Procedures Relative to Deactivation of OlefinPolymerization Catalysts A. Catalyst Preparation To 1610 kg 3550 pounds of IsoparE E, an isoparaffinic hydrocarbon fraction having a boiling range of 1160 1340C, was added 699 kg 1540 pounds of n butyl,s butyl magnesium solution 2.24 Mg in IsoparE C, an isoparaffinc hydrocarbon fraction having a boiling range of 980 1060C, A 47 kg 103 pound portion of anhydrous HC1 gas was added to the foregoing solution of the complex with agitation. The resultant slurry was cooled to ambient temperature 250C and 167 kg 367 pounds of a 4.6 wt. ethylaluminum dichloride EADC solution in IsoparR E was added along with another 45 kg 100 pounds of Isopar E.To the above mixture was added 27 kg 60 pounds of a 50 wt. tetra isopropoxy titanium solution in hexane. The resulting mixture was diluted to give 2722 kg 6000 pounds of catalyst premix. This premix was activated with 10 wt. triethylaluminum TEA in Isobar E and added continuously to the reactor. B. Polymerization Processes 1. Solution Process Ethylene was copolymerized with l octene in a 18.9 kl 5000 gallon stirred reactor to produce a copolymer having a melt flow value of 25 and density of 0.92 g cc. Catalyst premix and triethylaluminum side stream were added to the reactor at a rate of 36.3 kg hr 80 lbs hr and 0.45 kg hr 1 lb hr respectively along with 2.14 kg s 17,000 lbs hr of ethylene, 0.252 kg s 2000 lbs hr of 1 octene, and 11.3 kg s 90,000 lbs hr of Isobar E. The total pressure in the reactor was 3203 kPa 450 psig . The relative amounts of catalyst premix, triethylaluminum and IsoparR E were varied to maintain a reactor temperature of at least 1850C. The catalyst deactivator was added as a slurry in. Isopare E continuously as the polymer solution existed from the reactor. 2. High Pressure Process The examples of this process were conducted in a four zone stirred autoclave reactor. The reactor pressure was maintained at approximately 110 MPa 16000 psig . A mixture of ethylene and butene was added in the top zone of the reactor. The ratio of ethylene to butene was used to control the product density. The average residence time in the reactor was about 50 seconds. The activated catalyst was fed continuously into the top of the reactor at a rate sufficient to maintain the desired reactor temperature at the control point. There are seven entry or control points in the reactor.Point one was used to inject catalyst, point three was the temperature control point and point four was the entry point for the catalyst deactivator, a slurry of the catalyst deactivator in Isopare E, in an amount sufficient to deactivate the catalyst as determined by the temperature profile in the reactor. Melt flow value of the final product was controlled by adding hydrogen at 0.1 to 0.2 mole percent of reactor feed. C. Catalyst Deactivation Definitive data for catalyst deactivation comes from the high pressure process. Conversion of olefin in this process is between 10 and 15 . The AT between point one and point three is an indication of the exothermic nature of the process. The addition of known catalyst deactivators at point four kills the catalyst and the exotherm is effectively terminated.This can be seen by the AT between point three and point seven which is usually very small compared to the first AT. However, when no deactivating agent is used, or when the carrier alone is used, the AT7 3 is over 200C see Table 7 . Experiments 1 and 2 are examples of the invention and illustrate the effectiveness of the present invention in deactivating the catalyst compared to known catalyst deactivators and a control with no deactivator. The data which are presented in Table 1 are an average of several one hour periods. The data are typical of results obtained during at least eight hours of continuous polymerization at constant conditions such that the melt flow value of the product was 20 10 and the density was 0.918 0.006. During runs where no catalyst deactivator was added, the control temperature had to be raised approximately 120C in order to maintain these polymer properties. This is a further indication of the effectiveness of the compositions in terms of catalyst deactivation. Note that from the data of Table 1 while isopropyl alcohol is a better catalyst deactivator but suffers from the disadvantage of causing recycle contamination.

Reactor vent gas was passed through 1 3 ml of 0.01 N NaOH in about 150 ml of distilled degassed water until a phenolphthalein end point was reached. The volume of gas required was measured by a conventional bag meter which had been previously calibrated.The amount of HC1 in the gas stream was calculated using the volume of gas required for end point. The procedure was repeated several times for an average determination. For those experiments where the composition contained carbonate anion, HC1 neutralization may produce CO2 which will interfer with the HC1 determination.In this case, the scrubber solution was analyzed for carbonate and bicarbonate, and the true HC1 level recalculated. Solution Process HC1 which is produced by catalyst deactivation will be neutralized by the present invention provided that there is adequate residence time and proper mixing in the process. Different designs in different processes, and even in the same process, may result in different amounts of HC1 observed.In a solution process, the residence time is measured from the point of injection to the pressure control valve before the first stage separation. For the experiments in Table 8, the residence time is 1.3 minutes and Reynolds numbers are less than 100. Due to the very short residence time and poor mixing not all the HCl produced during catalyst deactivation is neutralized by the catalyst deactivators at the levels used. For example, the vent gas from the separator during runs using calcium stearate still contained over 30 ppm HC1. Examples of the invention demonstrate that the compositions of the present invention are as good as, or better than, calcium stearate in removing HC1 from the same process stream at the same levels and same catalyst efficiency.Production rate and polymer properties were also constant. As a further indication of the ability of the compounds to remove HC1 from the process, the chloride level in the polymer was found to increase as the HC1 level in the vent gas was reduced, indicating that the chloride is tied up by the composition and thus remains in the polymer but is inactive and does not degrade polymer properties or cause corrosion to processing equipment under the normal processing conditions of the resins.
