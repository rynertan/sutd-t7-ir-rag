# System for retaining stencil printing master on printing drum by clamp strip hinged along drum generator.

## Abstract
A magnet strip extends along one generator of a printing drum of a rotary stencil printing device. A clamp strip 8 , made of a material which is magnetically attractable, is hinged to said printing drum 1 along a line substantially parallel to said one generator thereof, near one side of said magnet strip 6 , so that said clamp strip 8 can be pivoted either so as to lie against and along said magnet strip 6 , with a leading edge of a stencil master 5 for stencil printing interposed therebetween so as to clamp the leading edge of the stencil master 5 to the printing drum 1 , or so as to be removed from said magnet strip 6 so as to release the stencil master 5 . Thereby the stencil master 5 can be conveniently retained to the printing drum 1 in a manner which is suitable for automation, and does not require any reinforced lug portion along the leading edge of the stencil master 5 .
