# Horizontal mold clamping and vertical injection type die cast machine.

## Abstract
In a horizontal mold clamping and vertical injection type die cast or injection molding machine of the type wherein stationary and movable metal molds are secured to stationary and movable platens and molten metal or plastic resin is injected into a mold cavity defined by metal molds from an injection cylinder, the stationary platen has a vertical member and a horizontal member integral there with which extends beneath the stationary metal mold, and the injection cylinder is suspended from the horizontal member. This construction prevents leakage of molten metal and provides a large space for mounting the metal molds.
