# Thermal energy storage system.

## Abstract
The invention is a sealed thermal energy storage contain er 11 including front and rear walls 12,13 which together are partially absorptive and partially transmissive of visible light with a transmittance in the range between 4 and 85 and an absorptance of at least 9 . Retained within the container 11 between the front and rear walls 12,13 is an at least partially light transmissive energy storage substance 15 that experi ences a liquid solid phase change between 45 F and 190 F. After being strategically positioned for exposure to solar radia tion, the energy storage substance 15 accumulates a sub stantial quantity of energy when changed to a liquid state by in cident sunlight and subsequently releases that energy when again freezing. In addition to sequentially and alternatively stor ing and releasing thermal energy, the container device 11 transmits a predetermined level of incident sunlight. Further more, the partially absorptive walls 12,13 are heated by sun light and function as efficient sources of heating for the retain ed energy storage substance 15 .
