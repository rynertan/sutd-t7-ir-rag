# BREATHING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A catalyst device for purifying a carbon monoxide con taining atmosphere, e.g. for use in breathing apparatus for underground workers, comprises a chamber containing a catalyst bed for low temperature oxidation of carbon monox ide and having an inlet for permitting ingress of air from the atmosphere and an exit for connection to the face of the user, e.g. by means of a face mask. When the mask for example and the chamber are in pneumatic connection, inhalation through the mask causes air to enter the chamber via the inlet, to contact the catalyst bed for catalytic oxidation of CO therin, if present, and thence pass to the mask. In order to provide resistance to deactivation by water vapour and obviate the need for a drying agent, the catalyst bed comprises one or more platinum group metals in combi nation with tin IV oxide e.g. Pt and Pd in combination with tin IV oxide.
