# Color picture tube.

## Abstract
In a color picture tube in which an electron beam produced by an electron gun passes through apertures in a shadow mask structure and excites a phosphor screen, the shadow mask structure comprises a shadow mask having an electron beam penetration area and a frame portion supporting this shadow mask. The shadow mask is formed of a metal of a lower coeffi cient of thermal expansion than the frame portion. The shadow mask has its periphery bent to form a skirt portion and the skirt portion is fixed by welding to the frame inner wall. The skirt por tion is subject to an inward compressive stress from the frame portion, and by means of this stress deformation during the manufacturing process and during operation is prevented.
