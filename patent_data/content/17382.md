## Description
This invention relates to ultrasonic imaging systems for producing ultrasonic images of objects. In particular the invention relstes to multielement transducer array ultrasonic imaging systems in which a selected group of adjacent elements is used, the selected group being sequences along the array to achieve a scanning action, and signals to and or from the elements of the selected group being delayed so as to focus the selected group to a desired focal length in transmission and or reception respectivelyO Such a system will hereinafter be referred to as a system of the kind specified In knoam systems of the kind specified in transmission high voltage pulses for application to the elements of the selected active group are produced by a single set of transmitters usually equal in number to half the number of elements in the active group The high voltage pulses from the transmitters are applied to the correct elements of the array via respective independently controllable switches, one switch bein connected in the signal path of each element. Thus the selection of the switches determines the active group of elements in transmission and the same switches are used to determine the active group in reception. Thus since the switching is performed with high voltage signals the switches must be high voltage com ponents and to ensure good system performance the switches should have a low on resistance to reduce losses in reception and should have a low noise contribution so as to provide a good signal noise ratio in reception. It is an object of the invention to provide a system of the kind specified wherein the above constraints on good system performance are obviate, In accordance with the invention a system of the kind specified includes a respective transmitter connected with each element of the array, each transmitter being arranged to be enabled by the application of an enable signal thereto and arranged to produce a transmission pulse which is applied to its connected element upon the application of a control signal while the transmitter is in the enabled state. Preferably there is also associated with each element a receiver switch arranged to be controlled by the output voltage of the respective transmitter so as to be closed by the quiescent output of said transmitter and to be opened by the transmission pulse output of said transmitter Preferably each said transmitter comprises an AhZ gate to the inputs of which a control signal and an enable signal are applied, a switch arranged to be controlled by the output of the NZ gate and connected between a first potential and a second different potential, and a capacitance having one terminal connected to the switch so as to be at the first potential when the switch is closed and to be at the second potential when the switch is open, the other terminal of the capacitance forming the transmitter output. Said transmitters are preferably so arranged that their quiescent output voltages are controlled by said enable signals. Preferabl each said receiver switch comprises a single diode. Preferably signals to the elements of the active group in transmission are delved by delaying the application of control signals to the transmitters connected with the elements Preferably the system includes a tapped digital shift register whose input is connected to a control signal generator and the outputs of the taps of which are connected to the transmitters associated with the elements of the active groups In this way, once the taps have been chosen which give the required quadratic relationship, the focal length can be varied by varying the shift register clock frequency as desired. A system of the kind specified in accordance with the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a schematic block diagram of part of the system Figure 2 shows signals appearing at various pointsIn Figure 1 and Figure 3 shows a circuit diagram of a transmitter o the system. Referring firstly to Figure 1, the system for producing an ultrasonic image of an object, e.g0 part of a human body, includes a linear array of 70 identical ultrasonic transducers t, only ten of which are shomt There is associated with each transducer Ii a transYnitter circuit T which will be described in greater detail below , each of which produces a transmission pulse in the form of a 150 V negative voltage spike see Figures 2 1 to 2 o in response to the receipt of a control signal a digital 51 , see Figures 2 f to 2 j applied to its input C in the presence of an enable signal see Figures 2 a to 2 e applied to its input E The voltage spike is fed to the associated transducer L to cause the transducer to emit a pulse of ultrasonic energy. Figure 2 shows the enable signals and control signals applied to, and the outputs from, all the transmitter circuits T of the system when five elements, m to m 4 are selected to form the active group in reception and transmission, Figures 2 a to 2 e show the enable signal en applied to the enable inputs b of the transmitter circuits T associated with the elements of the arrays Figures 2 f to 2 j show the control signals Cn applied to the. control inputs C of the transmitter circuits T. Figures 2 k to 2 p show the outputs tn from the transmitter circuits T. A curved wavefront is caused to be emitted from the transducers L of a selected active group by delaying the application of transmission pulses to the transducers, the delay increasing from the outer elements of the active group towards the centre. The transmission pulses are delayed by delaying the control signals as can be seen from Figures 2 f to 2 Ã…a in response to which the transmission pulses are produced The control signals digital l s are produced by a pulse repetition clock P . a digital 1 is produced every l f seconds, f being the frequency of production of ultrasonic pulses. The control signal digital t l is fed into a digital shift register D1 and outputs are takenfrom the shift register at points so spaced as to give the required quadratic relationship between the delays of the control signal digital 3 appearing at the outputs.The quadratic relationship of the delays of the output signals having been selected by the positions of the taps along the shift register, the absolute values of the delays and so the focal length of the emitted ultrasonic pulse may be varied by varying the frequency of the shift register clock Cli. The output low level control signals digital l s a from the shift register D1 are fed to a digital multiplexer M1 which sequences the control signals cn to the transmitters T of the correct elements of the active group of transducers L to cause the transmitters to produce high level transmission pulses as already mentioned. The active group in reception is determined by the application of enable signals to the transmitters g associated with the elements L of the active group0 The enable signals e are produced from a shif register SR which is used to are sequence the active group along the array. The shift register SR is of the recirculating type and has a number of elements equal to the number of transducer elements in the array. Each element is tapped and the taps are connected to the respective enable inputs E of the transmitters T. Enable signals digital l s are fed into five adjacent elements of the shift register when the system is activated and the shift register is clocked at the pulse repetition frequency f of the system. In reception, ultrasonic signals received by the transducer elements li and converted into electrical signals are passed to the receiver part of the syster via switchesS in the form of high voltage diodes. The switches are controlled by a small positive bias e0g. l.4 Volts applied at the receiver inputs and by the quiescent outputs of the transmitters T as determined by the enable signals applied to the transmitters a low positive output e.g. 2 7 Volts forward biases the respective switch and turns it on, a high negative output e.g. 150Volts reverse biases the respective switch and turns it off, In this way the diodes also protect the receiver part of the system from the high negative voltage pulses from the transmitters T because these high voltage pulses reverse bias the diodes0 Thus good signal quality in reception is obtained, since received signals pass only through the high voltage diodes S before reaching the signal processing circuitry, diodes being well know for their low on resistance and low noise contribution properties. The received signals from the transducers are conditioned in low noise receiver pre amplifiers R delayed by analogue delay lines, shoes collectively at D2, to equalise delays from the desired focal point amplified in amplifier. R and summed. The summed signals are then passed to video processing apparatus not shots in which the signals are used to provide a video image of the object on a cathode ray tube screen in a conventional way. As in transmission the signals are passed throvgh a multiplexer M 2 to connect the correct delays into the paths of signals from the correct elements of the active group. Unlike the digital multiplexer Dil used in transmission, the multiplexer M2 is an analogue multiplexer. Referring now also to Figure 3, each transmitter circuit g of the system includes a two input Ai gate A whose inputs form the enable signal input E and the control signal input C of the transmittere The output of the AND gate A is connected to the gate of a high voltage fieldeffect transistor F. The source and drain of transistorF are respectively connected to earth and to a source of 150V potential through a resistor R2. The drain of transistor F is also connected to one terminal of a capacitor CA, the other terminal of which forms the output of the transmitter. The enable signal input E is connected to the output through a resistor Ri. Thus it will be appreciated that the quiescent output of the transmitter is controlled by the enable signal applied to the input E of the transmitter, the absence of an enable signal causing the output of the transmitter to fall to substantially OV so as to prevent the diode switch S from conducting a bias of 1.4V being applied at the receiver input , and the presence of an enable signal causing the output of the transmitter to rise to approximately 2.7V so as to allow the diode switch S to conduct. It will also be appreciated that the transmitter produces a transmission pulse in the following way. With transistor F non conducting i.e. in the absence of both an enable signal and a control signal, or in the presence of only one of them the terminal of the capacitor CA which is connected to the drain of the transistor is charged to 150V. On the application of an enable signal the other terminal of the capacitor is charged to approximately 2.7V, producing a potential of approximately 150V across the capacitor CA. On the application of 2 control signal transistor F begins to conduct and the potential at the drain of the transistor fells to OV,producE a negative voltage pulse of approximately 150V at the output of the transmitter. The transducer elements L are mechanically focussed in a direction perpendicular to the direction of scanning of the array.
