# Ram casting machine for concrete slabs.

## Abstract
This publication describes a ram casting machine 1. . .6 for the fabrication of concrete slabs, movable on a casting bed 7 and incorporating a feed hopper 2 or similar unit, and members 3 , for generating internal pressure in the cast concrete 8 . The extruder in accordance with the invention comprises at least one ram member 3 , cyclically moving in the cast direction, with at least one wedge shaped surface assembly 32, 33 34, 35 , approximating a V shape by its longitudinal section, so that in the concrete entrance direc tion the first surface 32, 34 is essentially steeper towards the casting direction than the other surface 33 35 .
