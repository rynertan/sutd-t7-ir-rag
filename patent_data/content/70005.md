# Hydraulic fluid circuit of hydraulic shovel.

## Abstract
A hydraulic fluid circuit of a hydraulic shovel including a first hydraulic pump 10 , a second hydraulic pump 9 , a first directional control valve group 12 connected to the first hydraulic pump and a second directional control valve group 11 connected to the second hydraulic pump. The first directional control valve group 12 includes a first direction al control valve 15 and a second directional control valve 16 respectively connected to a first hydraulic cylinder 7 and a second hydraulic cylinder 8 . and the second direc tional control valve group 11 includes a third directional control valve 22 having a first working port 25 connected to one cylinder chamber of the first hydraulic cylinder 7 and a second working port 26 connected to one cylinder chamber of the second hydraulic cylinder 8 . A switching device 33 is mounted in the hydraulic fluid circuit and operative, when the first directional control valve 15 is switched to a first position for supplying hydraulic fluid from the first hydraulic pump 10 to the one cylinder chamber of the first hydraulic cylinder 7 , to switch the third directional control valve 22 to a third position for supplying hydraulic fluid from the second hydraulic pump 9 to the first hydraulic cylinder 7 through the first working port 25 , and also operative, when the second directional control valve 16 is switched to a second position for supplying hydraulic fluid from the first hydraulic pump 10 to the one cylinder chamber of the second hydraulic cylinder 8 , to switch the third directional control valve 22 to a fourth position for supplying hydraulic fluid from the second hydraulic pump 9 to the second hydraulic cylinder 8 through the second working port 26 .
