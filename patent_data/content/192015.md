## Description
The present invention relates to a sealing device for seedling a joilit between a first machine element and a second machine element. There exist substantia problems in providing liquid seal joints between diffen sllachirle elements included in constructions containing or transitting a liquid fluid under pressure. 1he sealing problem is even more difficult in the case ti3t the fluid has a high temperature as the material of the sealing device thereby also obtains a high temperature leading to for example material expansions.Previously known sealing devices which are able to maintain tightness in a joint between two machine elements at big pressures and high temperatures are complicated and expensive. The sealing devices previously known have a short service life because of the fact that they usually coniprise sealing elements of elastic materials which are sensitive to chemical attacks and are aged during the influence of increased temperatures.The object of the invention is to provide a simple and cheap sealing device being able to niaintain tightness in a joint between two machine elements in constructions containing or transferring a fluid which is under pressure and has an increased temperature.In order to comply with this object the sealing device according to the invention comprises a sealing element consisting of a rigid material, preferably nietal and sealing surfaces on the two machine elements, said sealing element comprising a first sealing portion and a second sealing portion, which are adapted sealingly to engage the sealing surfaces of each of th√® machine elements when the sealing element is compressed between the machine elements and at least said first sealing portion forms a projecting portion, wherein said first sealing portion is adapted to engage with its end portion a sealing surface of said first machine element, which sealing surface is substantially parallel with the direction of compression of the sealing element and wherein said projecting portion extends obliquely in such a wdy in relation to said sealing surface of said first machine element which sealing surface is substantially parallel with the direction of compression of tile sealing element that the end portion of the projecting portion is displayed towards said selling surface when the sealing device is being compressed. Thus, the invention solves the problem of providing a sealing device which is able to resist high pressures and high temperatures because of the fact that the sealing device is designed in such a way that the sealing element thereof can consist of a rigid material, preierably metal in a preferred embodiment of ine invention also said second scaling portion foils a projecting portion which is adapted t0 engage with its end portion sealing surface which is substantially parallel rrith tEle direction of compression of tile sealing element.Preferably the seal i iig element has a substantially V or Y shaped cross section and the sealing element forms at its said projecting portions of the first and second sealing portions, the end portions of said legs engaging the sealing surfaces of the first and the second sealing element, respectively . which sealing surfaces are substantially parallel with the direction of compression of theSealing element.The invention is described in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of an embodiment of a sealing element in the tonn of a sealing ring constituting a part of a sealing device according to the invention.

Fig. 7 is a cross sectional view showing the sealing device according to in its mounted position.In Figs 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 reference nume1 als 1 and 2 designate a first macline element and a second machine element, respectively, which are intended to be connected with each other so that a sealed joint is provided between the machine elements. The machine elements 1 and 2 comprise a seat 4 receiving a sealing element 6. The seat 4 forms sealing surfaces constituting together with the sealing element a sealing device according to the invention.For example the machine elements 1 and 2 are constituted by elements of a pump, a valve, a hydraulic circuit, a conduit system or other constructions in which fluids such as pressurized liquids in the form of oil is sealingly enclosed in the machine elements. Within the mechanical industry there are a lot of sealing places at which high pressures and great pressure variations are present. An example thereof is hydraulic presses. Thus, there is in Fig. 2 shown a conduit 3a for a pressure fluid, the sealing element 6 consisting of a sealing ring having a through opening 7 for conducting the fluid.in Figs 1 3 and 5 there are shown different enbodiments of sealing elements 6 intended to be included in sealing devices according to the invention. Thereby, it is important that the sealing elements consist of a rigid material which is resistent against high pressures and teiperatures. Metals, such as steel, copper, aluminium, etc are examples of such suitable material.The peripheral edge 8 of the sealing elements 6 according to the embodiments ofFig. l and 3 has large dimensions than the rest of tile sealing elements. This edge portion of the sealing elements merges in an envelope surface 9 axially or substantially axially positioned in the sealing element 6. The sealing elements are formed with recesses 11 or in the embodiment of Fig. l a groove 11 or a wedgeshaped cavity having two wall surfaces 12 facing each other.In order to seal a joint by means of a device according to the invention a sealing ring 6 is positioned in a seat 4 in one of the machine elements 1 and 2, wileieupor the other machine element is connected with the first machine element. The machine elements 1 and 2 are connected with each other in any suitable way. Ther by tile sealing ring is deformed by being compressed, the edge portions of the sealing ring thereby sealingly engaging the edge portions 5 of the seat 4, said edge portions 5 constituting the sealing surfaces constituting parts of the sealing device according to the ijivention, so that tile reliable sealing is provide tween the machine elements 1 and 2 even when the elemeuts conduct a fluid hav E pressure arid high temperature. he sealing is piovides substantially in the region of the edge 5 of the Suats 4 ee refererree numerals 15 in Fiys 2 arid 4.When conducting a high pressure fluid there is provided a sealing which is even ore reliable because of the fact that the pressure of the fluid acts on the sealing ring or pressure surfaces 13 thereof, said pressure surfaces extending torn the peripheral edge portions 8 of the sealing element 6 in the direction of the central portion of the sealing element. Tite pressure surfaces 13 of the sealing element can have such an extension that they extend into the seat 4, see reference numeral 14 in Fig. 2. The higher pressure in the conduit 3a the better ealing by pressure action on the pressure surfaces 13, 14 and on the inner surface 19 of the sealing element 6.If there is a pressure fluid outside the ealing regions 15 the pressure action on the wall surfaces l2 of the groove 11 and also on the sealing surfaces 10 will act for maintaining the edge portions rf the sealing element 6 in tie sealing position. ounting the sealing element 6 the legs 17 defined by the groove 11 and the ide surfaces of tie sealing element 6 are rotated around the inner end 18 of the groove 11, so that the sealing element is compressed and the width of the eroove 11 is reduced providing a reaction force in the legs 17. Thereby the sealing surfaces 10 of the legs 17 extend at an angle in relation to the sealing eleirient 6, see reference numeral 16 in Fig. 2, increasing the outer ameter of the sealing element so that the seat 4 is filled up and the sealing element is deformed at the edge portions 15.in Fig. 3 there is shown an embodiment of the sealing element 6 having two grooves Thereby the sealing element is provided with three legs 1 , the sealing unction being provided substantially by means of the two side legs. in Figs 5, 6 and 7 there is shown another embodiment of a sealing element 6 of rt sealing device according to the invention. In the embodiment of the sealing element shown in this figures the tolerances of manufacturing tools Or tile like or of the seats 4 and tile surface quality thereof are of less importance with regard to the possibilities of obtaining a good sealing function.The sealing element 6 consists of tile satire type of material and has a corresponding function rigid type of action as described with reference to the above embodiments of sealing elements according to the irivntion. Thus, the sealing element 6 has an inner groove 11 having opposing wall surfaces 12 having the direct function of pressure surfaces 14.In mounting the sealing element 6 the diameter of tie sealing element is increased as a result of the reduction of the thickness of the sealing element so that tile peripheral surface 20 of the sealing element 6 is forced against tie sealing surfaces 21 of the sealing device, said surfaces being fornied at the bottom of the seat 4. In order to provide a larger sealing surface the seat 4 can be provided with a sealing flange 24 in a special embodiment of the device according to the invention. These sealing flanges 24 constitute buckers for the sealing element 6 when the element is compressed. Thereby the edge portions 23 of the inner surfaces of the sealing element 6 will constitute active sealing portions of the sealing element 6. In conducting fluids under high pressure there is obtained an improved sealing action by means of pressure action on the pressure surfaces 14 of the wall surfaces 12 of the sealing legs 17.An advantage of the sealing device according to the invention is that the sealing element of the device can be chosen from material resistant against chemical attacks, for example and acid proof material. It is also possible to choose the material of the sealing element with regard to the material of the machine elements between which tit joint shall be sealed, thereby providing the sealing element with the same properties with egard to coefficient of firmal expansion and so on. however, it is preferred to choose a material of the sealing element which is somewhat softer than the material of the sealing surfaces with which the sealing element is intended to cooperate. Thereby the material of the sealing element will by deformation be pressed into the pores of the material of the sealing surfaces and the risk of destruction of the sealing surfaces is obviated.In mounting a sealing element 6 of the sealing device according to the invention there can be used a bucker 26 in accordance with what is shown in Fig. 8. In assembling the maclline elements 1 and 2 for sealing the joint 3 the bucker 26 is introduced in the sealing clement, providing an improved engagement and sealing within the sealing areas 15 in the directions shown by means of tile arrows 27. A corresponding bucker can be used when mounting a sealing element 6 of tie kind shown in for example Fig. 5. The invention can be modified within the scope of the following claims. For example the sealing element Of the sealing device according to the invention can be of another design that the design according to the embodiments shown with reference to the drawings and consist o1 other materials tiiaii stated in the specification.The seats of the Illacllille clement to be sealed Lan have any suitable shape and tie sealing elements can be adapted thereto. An adequate sealing is obtained even if the grooves of the sealing element are substantially closed after the mounting operation.
