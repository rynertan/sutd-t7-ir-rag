# Universal blending silo and method.

## Abstract
The present invention is a universal system and method for blending the material contents of a silo 200 having a predetermined interior cross sectional area by layer blend ing or across vertical columns, column blending, or a combi nation of layer and column blending the method employs either vertical displacement of a partial vertical column of the silo content to provide a representative mixture in every horizontal cross section in order to reduce the number of necessary recycles to a minimum or substantially simultane ous multilevel displacement, with subsequent uniform dis charge over the whole horizontal cross section of the silo to remix material that may been segregated during the filling or recycling the system includes a blending bottom 204 whose construction gives the opportunity to make a choice of a discharge over only a partial area of the outlet area or a uniform discharge over the whole outlet area or a predictable discharge velocity distribution over the outlet area.
