# Semiconductor device provided with control electrode.

## Abstract
A gate turn off thyristor and a transistor are disclosed, each of which comprises a semiconductor substrate 1, 101 including at least three semiconductor layers between a pair of principal surfaces, adjacent ones of the semiconductor layers being different in conductivity type from each other, a first one of the semiconductor layers being formed of at least one strip shaped region 20, 120 with a constant width, a second one 30, 130 of the semiconductor layers being exposed to a first principal surface of the semiconductor substrate together with the strip shaped region a first main electrode 2, 102 kept in ohmic contact with the strip shaped region at the first principal surface a first control electrode 3a, 103a kept in ohmic contact with the second semicon ductor layer 30, 130 on one side of the strip shaped region in the direction of the width thereof and connected directly to a control terminal 6, 106 a second control electrode 3b, 103b kept in ohmic contact with the second semiconductor layer on the other side of the strip shaped region in the direction of the width thereof and connected to the control terminal through the first control electrode and the resist ance R of the second semiconductor layer between the first control electrode and the second control electrode a second main electrode 4, 104 kept in ohmic contact with a second principal surface of the semiconductor substrate and means provided in the semiconductor substrate for accelerating the spatial biasing of a conductive region to the other side of the strip shaped region in the direction of the width thereof when a current flowing across the semiconductor substrate is cut off, thereby enlarging the area of safety operation.
