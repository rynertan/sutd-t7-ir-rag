## Description
Clavulanic Acid Derivatives, A Process for Their Preparation and Their Use The present invention relates to ss lactam antibacterial agents, to the process for their preparation and to compositions containing them. British Patent Application No. 16764 77 see alsoU.S. Serial No. 895441, Belgian Patent No. 187034 and WestGerman Offenlegungsschrift No. P2817085.6 discloses inter alia the compounds of the formula I EMI1.1 and esters thereof wherein X1 is hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of up to 5 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms, a hydroxy alkyl group of up to 5 carbon toms or an optionally substituted phenyl group. Such compounds were described.as antibacterial agents andB lactamase inhibitors. It has now been discovered that a crystalline. secondary amine can be prepared that is a ss lactamase inhibitor that enhances the effectiveness of penicillins or cephalosporins and which also has antibacterial properties in its own right and which is advantageously water soluble. The present invention provides the compound of the formula II EMI2.1 The compound of the formula II per se exists in the form of a zwitterion, that is it may be represented as shown in formula IIa EMI2.2 This zwitterionic compound is favoured in view of its crystalline form, stability and greater solubility than previously prepared ss lactamase inhibitory amines such as those within the formula I . As has been previously indicated we prefer to prepare and use the crystalline zwitterionic compound of formula II . However, esters of the compound of the formula II also form part of this invention, for example as the free base or as the acid addition salt since such compounds may also be used to enhance the effectiveness of penicillins or cephalosporins. Certain suitable esters of the compounds of the formula II include those of the formula III and IV EMI3.1 wherein A1 is an alkyl group of 1 6 carbon atoms optionally substituted by an alkoxyl or acyloxyl group of 1 7 carbon atoms A2 is an alkenyl or alkynyl group of up to 5 carbon atoms or is a phenyl group optionally substituted by a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkyl or alkoxyl of up to 4 carbon atoms and A3 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of up to 4 carbon atoms or a phenyl group optionally substituted by a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, nitro or alkyl or alkoxyl of up to 4 carbon atoms. Suitable esters of the compound of the formula II include the methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, allyl, CH2 C CH, methoxymethyl, acetoxymethyl, propionoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, methoxycarbonyl oxyethyl, ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl, dimethoxyphthalidyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl, ethoxybenzyl, nitrobenzyl, chlorobenzyl or the like ester such as the 2 methylallyl ester. Certain favoured groups A1 include the methyl, methoxymethyl, acetoxymethyl, acetoxyethyl, phthalidyl, ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl and the like groups. Certain favoured groups A2 include the phenyl and 4 methoxyphenyl groups. A particularly favoured moiety A3 is the hydrogen atom. Certain other favoured values for A1 include those of the sub formulae c , d and e CHA5 0A6 c CHA5 COA6 d CHA5 C02A6 e wherein A5 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and A6 is an alkyl group of up to 4 carbon atoms or a phenyl or benzyl group either of which may be substituted by one or two alkyl or alkoxyl groups of up to 3 carbon atoms or by a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a nitro group orA5 is joined to A6 to form the residue of an unsubstituted saturated 5 or 6 membered heteroalicyclic ring or an ortho phenylene group which may be substituted by one or two alkyl or alkoxyl groups of up to 3 carbon atoms or by a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or nitro group. An aptacyclicvalue for the sub group of the formula c is CH2 OA6. An apt acyclicvalue for the sub group of theformula d is CH2 CO A6. An apt acyclicvalue for the sub group of the formula e is CH2 C02A6. A further apt acyclicvalue for the sub group of the formula 3 is CH CH3 C02A6. Favoured values for A6 in the preceding acyclic moieties include the methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, phenyl and benzyl groups. Apt cyclic values for the sub group of the formula c include the tetrahydropyranyl and tetrahydrofuranyl groups. Esters of the compounds of the formula, II such as those of the compounds of the formulae III or IV may be presented in the form of their acid addition salts if desired. The acid used to form the salt will most suitably be pharmaceutically acceptable, but nonpharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are also envisaged, for example as intermediates in the preparation of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts by ion exchange.Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid additions salts include those of inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric, phosphoric, sulphuric, methanesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, citric, malic, acetic, lactic, tartaric, propionic, succinic or the like acid. Most suitably the acid addition salt is provided as a solid and preferably as a crystalline solid. Compounds of this invention wherein crystalline form may be solvated, for example hydrated. The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises acompound of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions of the invention include those in a form adapted for oral, topical or parenteral use and may be used for the treatment of the infection in mammals including humans. Suitable forms of the compositions of this invention include tablets, capsules, creams, syrups, suspensions, solutions, reconstitutable powders and sterile forms suitable for injection or infusion. Such compositions may contain conventional pharmaceutically acceptable materials such as diluents, binders, colours, flavours, preservatives, disintegrant and the like in accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice in the manner well understood by those skilled in the art of formulating antibiotics. Injectable or infusable compositions of a compound of the invention are particularly suitable as high blood levels of the compound can occur after administration by injection or infusion. Thus, one preferred composition aspect of this invention comprises a compound of the invention in sterile form and most suitably in sterile crystalline form.The zwitterionic compounds of this invention are particularly suitable for use in such compositions. The injectable solution of the compound of this invention may be made up in a sterile pyrogen free liquid such as water, aqueous ethanol or the like. Compounds of this invention when in highly pure crystalline form tend to have higher aqueous solubilities than those of our previously prepared pure crystalline 9 amino deoxyclavulanic acid derivatives such as 9 N benzylaminodeoxyclavulanic acid. This means that the compounds are easier to administer than the previously known compounds.In this circumstance it is often convenient to administer the solution by intra muscular injection which is less complicated than intravenous administration. This invention also provides the use of the compound of the formula II for preparing injectable aqueous solutions. Such solutions may be prepared by dissolving the sterile compound of the formula II in sterile water.Suitably this water is Water for Injection BP or the equivalent and may contain electrolytes to render it isotonic. A particularly suitable injectable aqueous solution of this invention is one which contains not less than 15 w w of the compound of the formula II , favourably not less than 20 w w of the compound of the formula II and preferably not less than 25 w w of the compound of the formula II . Unit dose compositions comprising a compound of this invention adapted for oral administration form a further suitable composition aspect of this invention. However, orally administrable forms are generally less favoured than injectable forms owing to the relatively poor absorption of the compounds from the gastro intestinal tract. Despite this orally administrable compositions are of use as a synergistically effective blood level can be expected at high doses and at lower doses such compositions may be used to treat infections localised in the gastro intestinal tract. Unit dose compositions comprising a compound of this invention adapted for topical administration are also presented by this invention. In this instance topical administration also includes local administration to internal surfaces of mammary glands of cattle, for example during the treatment of mastitis by intra mammary administration. The compounds of the formula may be present in the composition as sole therapeutic agent or they may be present together with other therapeutic agents such as penicillin or cephalosporin. Considerable advantages accrue from the inclusion of a penicillin or cephalosporin since the resulting composition shows enhanced effectiveness synergy . Suitable penicillins for inclusion in the compositions of this invention include benzylpenicillin, phen oxymethylpenicillin, carbenicillin, azidocillin, propicillin, ampicillin, amoxycillin, epicillin, ticarcillin, cyclacillin, pirbenicillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, celbenicillin and other known penicillins including pro drugs therefore such as their in vivo hydrolysable esters such as the acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl or phthalidyl esters of ampicillin, benzylpenicillin or amoxycillin, and aldehyde or ketone adducts of penicillins containing a 6 aminoacetamide side chain such as hetacillin, metampicillin and analogous derivatives of amoxycillin or a esters of carbenicillin or ticarcillin such as their phenyl or indanyl a esters. Suitable cephalosporins for inclusion in the compositions of this invention include cefatrizine, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, cephalexin, cephacetrile, cephamandole nafate, cephapirin, cepradine, 4 hydroxycephalexin, cefaparole, cephaloglycin, and other known cephalosporins or pro drugs thereof. Such compounds are frequently used in the form of a salt or hydrate or the like. Naturally if the penicillin or cephalosporin present in the composition is not suitable for oral administration then the composition will be adapted for parenteral administration. As previously indicated such injectable or infusable compositions are preferred. Highly favoured penicillins for use in the compositions of this invention include ampicillin, amoxycillin, carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Such penicillins may be used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as the sodium salt. Alternatively the awpicillin or aPnoxycillln ney be used in the form of fine particles of the zwitterionic form generally as ampicillin trihydrate or amoxycillin trihydrate for use in an injectable suspension, for example, in the manner hereinbefore described for a compound of this invention. The preferred penicillin for use in the synergistic composition is amoxycillin, for example as its sodium salt or trihydrate. Particularly suitable cephalosporins for use in the compositions of this invention include cephaloridine and cefazolin. Such cephalosporins may be used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, for example the sodium salt. When present together with a cephalosporin or penicillin, the ratio of a compound of the invention to the penicillin or cephalosporin agent may vary over a wide range of ratios, such as from 10 1 to 1 10 for example about 3 1, 2 1, 1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 1 5 or 1 6, wt wt, based on pure free antibiotic equivalent . Orally administrable compositions containing a compound of the invention will normally contain relatively more synergist than corresponding injectable compositions, for example the ratio in an oral composition may be from about 3 1 to about 1 1 whereas a corresponding injectable composition may contain a ratio of about 1 1 to about 1 3 compound of the invention penicillin or cephalosporin . The total quantity of a compound of the invention in any unit dosage will normally be between 25 and 1000 mg and will usually be between 50 and 500 mg, for example about 62.5, 100, 125, 150, 200 or 250 mg. Compositions of this invention may be used for the treatment of infections inter alia, the respiratory tract, the urinary tract and soft tissues in humans and mastitis in cattle. Normally between 50 and 1000 mg of the compounds of the invention will be administered each day of treatment but more usually between 100 and 750 mg of the compounds of the invention will be administered per day, for example as 1 6 doses, more usually as 2, 3 or 4 doses. The penicillin or cephalosporin in the synergistic composition of this invention will normally be present at approximately the amount at which it is conveniently used which will usually be expected to be from about 62.5 to 1000 mg per dose, more usually about 125, 250 or 500 mg per dose. One particularly favoured composition of this invention will contain from 150 to 1000 mg of amoxycillin as the trihydrate or sodium salt and from 25 to 500 mg of a compound of this invention. Most suitably this form of composition will contain the compound of the formula II . A further particularly favoured composition of this invention will contain from 150 to 1000 mg of ampicillin or a pro drug therefor and from 25 to 500 mg of a compound of this invention. Most suitably this form of composition will contain ampicillin trihydrate, ampicillin anhydrate, sodium ampicillin, hetacillin, pivampicillin hydrochloride bacampicillin hydrochloride or talampicillin hydrochloride.most suitably this form of the composition will contain a comppund of the formula II . Most suitably the preceding compositions will contain from 200 to 700 mg of the penicillin component. Most suitably the preceding composition will comprise from 50 to 250 mg of a compound of the formula II in crystalline form. Such compositions may be adapted for oral or parenteral use except when containing in vivo hydrolysable ester of ampicillin or amoxycillin in which case the compositions will not be adapted for parenteral administration. Another particularly favoured composition of this invention will contain from 200 to 2000 mg of carbenicillin, ticarcillin or a pro drug therefor and from 50 to 500 mg of a compound of the invention. Suitably this form of composition will contain di sodium carbenicillin. Suitably this form of the composition will contain di sodium ticarcillin. More suitably this form of the composition will contain from 75 to 250 mg of a compound of the formula II preferably in crystalline form. Such compositions containing di salts of carbenicillin and ticarcillin will be adapted for parenteral administration. The present invention also provides a method of treating bacterial infections in humans or domestic mammals which comprises the administration of a composition of this invention. Commonly the infection treated will be due to a strain of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes,Escherichia coli, Proteus sp. or the like. The organisms believed to be most readily treated by an antibacterially effected amount of a compound of this invention isStaphylococcus aureus. The other organisms named are more readily treated by using a synergistically effective amount of the compound of the invention and a penicillin or cephalosporin. The administration of the two components may take place separately but in general we prefer to use a composition containing both the synergist and the penicillin or cephalosporin. The indications for treatment include respiratory tract and urinary tract infections in humans and mastitis in cattle. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula II as hereinbefore defined or an ester thereof which process comprises the hydrogenation of a compound of the formula V EMI12.1 or ester thereof, wherein R1 is isopropyl or isopropylene and wherein R3 is a hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group,R4 is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, or a phenyl group optionally substituted with an inert organic group such as lower alkyl or lower alkoxy or wherein R3 andR4 together represent a butadiene moiety and thereafter if desired esterifying the zwitterion of the formula via as hereinbefore defined which was produced by the hyt ogena tion of the compound of the formula V or a hydrogenolysable ester thereof. When used herein the term hydrogenolysable ester means an ester which on hydrogenation is cleaved to yield the parent carboxylic acid. i sen used herein the term lower alkyl means an alkyl group with 1 4 carbon atoms. Thus examples of suitable alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, sec butyl and iso butyl. Particularly suitable groups CH2CR3 CHR4 for use in the compounds of formula V include the following, CH2CH CH3, CH2CH CHC6H5, CH2C cH3 CH2, CH2C C2H5 CH2 CH2C nC3H7 CH2, CH2C CH3 CHCH3, CH2C CH3 C CH3 CH2C CH3 CHC2H5, CH2C CH3 CHC6H5 and CH C H Favoured groups CH2CR3 CHR4 are CH2CH CHCH3, CH2OH CHC6H5, CH2C CH3 CH2, CH2c cH3 cHc6H5 and CH2C6H5. Particalar.ly preferred groups CH2CR3CHR are CH2C CH3 OH2, CH2C CH3 CHC6H5 and CH2C6H5. A process according to this invention comprises the 3 4.preceding hydrogenation when CH2CR CHR is a CHC H group. The hydrogenation is normally carries out in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. The catalyst we have preferred to use is palladium, for example in the form of palladium on carbon charcoal , palladium on barium sulphate, palladium on calcium carbonate, palladium black or the like. A favoured catalyst is palladium on carbon sometimes referred to as palladium on charcoal for example 5 , 10 , 20 or 30 palladium on carbon. The high palladium content catalysts are particularly apt as smaller total weights of catalyst can be employed thereby avoiding possible problems associated with adsorption of product onto the carbon. A low, medium or high pressure of hydrogen may be used in this reaction, for example from 1 to 6 atmospheres.In general if the catalyst used contains a lower percentage of palladium for example 5 or 10 palladium then better yields of the desired product are obtained using a pressure of about 3 to 5 atmospheres of hydrogen, for example about 4 atmospheres of hydrogen. In general if the catalyst used contains a higher percentage of palladium for example 20 or 30 palladium then acceptable yields of the desired product may also be obtained at low and medium pressures of hydrogen, for example about 1 to 2 atmospheres of hydrogen. We have found it convenient to use an atmospheric or slightly superatmospheric pressure of hydrogen in conjunction with higher palladium content catalysts. The reaction is normally carried out at a nonextreme temperature, for example from OOC to 300C and more usually from 12 C to 25 C. It is generally convenient to carry out the reaction at ambient temperature. Suitable solvents for carrying out the hydrogenation include ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate or mixtures of such solvents or such solvents in the presence of water. A favoured solvent is aqueous tetrahydrofuran. Further favoured solvents are ethanol or a mixture of isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran and water. We have preferred to carry out the hydrogenation reaction on a hydrogenolysable ester of a compound of the formula V so that a compound of the formula II per se is formed by the hydrogenation. Such hydrogenation reaction proceeds at least in part via the formation of a compound of the formula V . Favoured hydrogenolysable esters include benzyl and substituted benzyl esters such as methoxybenzyl, nitrobenzyl for example the p nitrobenzyl ester , chlorobenzyl, bromobenzyl and like esters. A particularly suitable hydrogenolysable ester is the benzyl ester. A further particularly suitable hydrogenolysable ester is the p methoxybenzyl ester. Further favoured hydrogenolysable ester groups include those groups CH2CR3 CHR4 that have been specified hereinbefore as being favoured for removal from a nitrogen atom by hydrogenolysis If the hydrogenation is performed on non hydrogenolysable esters of the compound of the formula V then naturally an ester of the compound of the formula II results. The product may generally be isolated from the reaction mixture by filtering off the solids the catalyst, which should be well washed to remove the product and then evaporating the solvent, preferably under low pressure, to yield the initial product. Further purification may be effected by such conventional methods as chromatography over cellulose or other mild stationary phase eluting with a C14 alkanol optionally in the presence of water and optionally in the presence of tetrahydrofuran. Evaporation of the combined active fraction identified by aqueous potassium permanganate spray on tlc then yields the desired compound in pure form. The desired product is normally obtained in crystalline form unless it is an unsalted ester .Trituration under ethanol, isopropanol or the like C14 alkanol or other conventional solvent such as a ketone, ether or ester solvent or other conventional solvent for example of up to 6 carbon atoms and more suitably of up to 4 carbon atoms may also be used to aid crystallisation. Recrystallisation from ethanol or the like may also be employed. The solvent used in such processes may advantageously be moist. The preceding work up procedures successfully separate the desired compound from other products of the hydrogenation such as the disecondarybutylamine derivative. Zwitterionic compounds, such as those of the formula II may be obtained from high yielding reactions by the addition of C1 4 alkanol such as cold ethanol or the like to the initial product. The initial product of the lower yielding reactions may contain considerable impurities so that it may be advantageous to wash the initial product by dissolving in a water immiscible organic solvent and extracting into water. Evaporation of the aqueous phase, preferably under a good vacuum, then yields a purer product which may be further purified if desired as previously described. Unsalted esters of the compounds of the formula II tend to be oils so that it is often more convenient for handling to convert them into solid acid addition salts, for example by reaction with one equivalent of an acid. Alternatively the non hydrogenolysable ester of the compound of the formula V may be hydrogenated in the presence of one equivalent of an acid, that is they may be hydrogenated in the form of their acid addition salt. The compounds of the formula II may be hydrogenated in the form of their acid addition salts with a strong acid but this is not a preferred form of the process of this invention. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of an ester of a compound of the formula II which process comprises the reaction of the compound of the formula II with an esterifying agent. The zwitterionic compound of the formula TI may be dissolved or suspended in a solvent such as dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate or other non esterifiable solvents and therein esterified. Suitable temperatures for such a reaction range from about 00 to about 250C. Suitable esterifying reagents include reactive halides and their equivalents, alkyl oxonium salts and the like. When a reagent such as a reactive iodide, chloride, bromide, tosylate, mesylate or the equivalent is used, the resulting salt is generally suitable for use in a composition of this invention. Alternatively, the salt may be converted to a free base or alternative salt. When an alkyl oxonium salt is used, it is preferred to convert the resulting tetrafluoroborate to the free base or alternative Bait. The various afore mentioned salts may be converted to the free base by neutralisation, for example by contacting a solution of the salt in water with an organic phase, neutralising the salt by adding a base and extracting the liberated amine into the organic phase. This amine may thereafter be re salted by reacting with an appropriate acid, for example in a dry organic solvent.It is generally preferred to use not more than one equivalent of acid for this process. Alternatively, the originally formed salt may be converted into the alternative salt using an ion exchange material for example, by pissing an aqueous solution of one salt through a bed of an anion exchange resin in the form of the form of the desired salt such as the chloride form. The salts may normally be obtained in solid form by dissolving in a fairly polar organic solvent such as ethanol, tetrahydrofuran or the like and then precipitating using a non polar solvent such as diethyl ether, cyclohexane or the like. The salts of the esters of the compounds of the formula II may normally be obtained in crystalline form by conventional methods such as trituration under or crystallisation or recrystallisation from a suitable organic solvent such as ether, acetone, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran or the like. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of an ester of the compound of the formula II which process comprises the reaction of an acid addition salt of the compound of the formula II with an alcohol in the presence of a condensation promoting agent. Suitable condensation promoting agents for use in this process include carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarboxiimide and the chemical equivalents thereof. The acid addition salt may be formed in situ or may be preformed. The acid employed will normally be a strong acid such as a methane sulphonic acid, p toluene sulphonic or the like or trifluoroacetic acid or the like. The reaction is is normally carried out in an inert organic solvent. When When the the ester being formed is that of a Liquid alcohol it is convenient to use that alcohol as the solvent or as parl of the Ofsolvent system. The esterif I cation ts generally performed performed at a gt non extreme temperature such as to 35 C, for 35 C,for example from about low to 25 C. Con veniently the reaction maybe performed at ambient temperature. Since the compound of the formula V and its salts and esters are of use as intermediates they form part of this invention. Suitably the compounds of the formula V are in the form of an ester of a type hereinbefore described. Suitably the compounds of the formula V are in the form of a salt such as in alkali metal salt, fdr example the lithium salt. The intermediates of the formula v and its salts and esters may be prepared by the methods of BritishApplication No. 41887 7S, U.S. Serial No. 731928, BelgianPatent No. 847044 or West German OffenlegungsschriftP2646003.7.
