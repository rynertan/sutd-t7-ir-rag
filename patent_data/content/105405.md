# LOCK

## Abstract
In a plate tumbler lock, each tumbler spring 30 is positioned centrally between guide faces of the lock which define the path of movement of the tumbler. The releasing position of the tumbler is defined by contact between the tumbler and key at a position nearer to one 26 of the guide faces than to an opposite 25 guide face.
