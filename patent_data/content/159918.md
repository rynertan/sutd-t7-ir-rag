## Description
FABRIC SOFTENING COMPOSITION The present invention relates to a fabric softening composition. In particular but not exclusively it relates to an aqueous based concentrated fabric softening composition. Fabric softening compositions for the treatment of fabrics, particularly after washing, to improve the feel of the fabrics and, in the case of clothes, to improve the comfort in wear, conventionally include cationic fabric softening agents. It is known from European patent specification NosEP A 86104, 86105, 86106 and 88520 UNILEVER that the softening performance of such compositions, their manufacture, ease of use and physical properties can be improved, particularly where the composition is in the form of a concentrated aqueous based product, by the inclusion in the composition of lanolin or a lanolin like material. We have now surprisingly found that the properties of such compositions can be maintained if a part of the lanolin or lanolin like material is replaced by specific alkoxylated nonionic materials. Thus, according to the invention, there is provided a fabric softening composition comprising a waterinsoluble cationic fabric softener, lanolin or a lanolinlike material and an alkylene oxide adduct of a fatty compound selected from fatty alcohols, fatty acids, fatty esters, fatty amines and fatty acid amides, the fatty compound containing at least 10 carbon atoms and the adduct containing an average of not more than 7 alkylene oxide groups per molecule. The composition may take the form of a solid product, containing the cationic softener, the lanolin or lanolin like material, the alkoxylated nonionic material and optionally a carrier material which should ideally be a water soluble or dispersible material such as urea or .odium sulphate. More usually however, the composition will take the form of a liquid product, containing the cationic softener, the lanolin or lanolin like material, the alkoxylated nonionic material and an aqueous base. The weight ratio of the cationic softener to the sum oe the lanolin or lanolin like material and the alkoxylated nonionic material is preferably from 20 1 to 1 20, most preferably from about 10 1 to about 1 10.

An essential component of the present invention is lanolin or a lanolin like material. Lanolin is wool wax which has been purified by various purification steps including washing, neutralisation, filtration, bleaching and deodorisation. Lanolin is composed primarily of esters which constitute the active constituents in the present invention and which yield on hydrolysis a mixture of complex alcohols and fatty acids. The alcohols which form about half of the ester component by weight, include sterols and terpene alcohols. The sterols amount to about 30 and include cholesterol, 7 dehydrocholesterol and cerebosterol and dihydrocholesterol cholestanol . The terpene alcohols include lanesterol C30H50O , dihydrolanesterol C30H52 0 , agnosterol C30H48O , dihydroagnosterol C30H50 0 . Lanolin is available commercially in a number of forms. Lanolin as such contains the active constituents primarily in their ester form. It is also available in two hydrolysed forms where the active constituents are primarily in their alcoholic or carboxylic acid form.Further, lanolin may be hydrogenated to form a product where the active constituents are present primarily only in their alcoholic form. Lanolin is also commercially available in propoxylated and acetylated forms. As used herein the term lanolin is intended to refer to any such material derived from wool wax whether the active constituents are in the alcoholic, ester, alkoxylated, hydrogenated of other chemical form.

Many of the active constituents of lanolin can be prepared synthetically, from sources other than wool wax or can be extracted from wool wax and other naturally occurring material. While for cost reasons the cosercially available forms of lanolin are preferred for the present invention, it is also possible to use any one or adore of the active constituents referred to above however derived, and also materials of similar structure.
