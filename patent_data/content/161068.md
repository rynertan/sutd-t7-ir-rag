# Computerised weighing apparatus of combinatorial weighing type.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a combinatorial weighing method for a computerized weighing apparatus, wherein a combination pattern in which each pair of weighing machines is composed of only one partner to participate into a combinatorial com putation, and a combination pattern in which only one pair is composed of two partners is selected to compute a total combined weight value so that, in case both two partners of one pair are selected as the weighing machines which have been selected for an optimum combination so that they have discharged their articles, at least one of the partners is caused not to participate into a subsequent combinatorial compu tation but is subjected to a zero point adjustment, thereby improving combinatorial weighing accuracy.
