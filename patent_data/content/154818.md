# Control system for induced draft combustion.

## Abstract
An integrated, closed loop system for controlling the fuel to air ratio in an induced draft combustion chamber 12 which has a control pilot 26 through which a draft is induced so that the fuel to air ratio in the control pilot chamber 26 has a predetermined ratio to the fuel to air ratio in the primary com bustion chamber 12 .
