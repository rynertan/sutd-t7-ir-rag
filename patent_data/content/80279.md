# Method for assaying proteases with tagged proteinaceous inhibitors.

## Abstract
A new and useful method for assaying proteases, in which an excess of tagged proteinaceous inhibitor of a protease is mixed in solution with a sample containing the protease to form a mixture of a tagged inhibitor protease complex and free tagged inhibitor. The complex is sepa rated from the tagged inhibitor and the tag measured. Alter natively, anti protease antibody may be added to bind the complex so that assay specificity and or separation is enhanced. The method of this invention is applicable to assaying minute quantities of clinically significant proteases e.g. renin, kallikrein, thrombin occurring in serum, plasma, urine and other tissues.

## Description
Method for ssaying proteasse with tagged proteinaceous inhibitors This invention relates to new and useful methods for determining or quantifying proteases as unknowns in samples by employing tagged proteinaceous inhibitors of proteases in immunoassays. Previous attempts to quantify or determine an enzyme or its activity involved one of at least four general methods.Enzyme activity can be measured in vivo or in vitro by the ability of an enzyme, generally purified, to hydrolyze its natural substrate to yield a measurable product Secondly, enzyme activity can also be measured by the ability of an enzyme to hydrolyze a synthetic substrate. Thirdly, an enzyme can be measured by an immunoassay, typically by a radioimmunoassay using tagged anti enzyme antibody or tagged enzyme. Lastly, an enzyme can also be measured by the use of enzyme inhibitors that are simple organic reagents, not proteinaceous. All of these methods for quantifying enzymes suffer from the lack of specificity of the tagged binding partner of the enzyme, e.g. natural or synthetic substrate, anti enzyme antibody or inhibitor, for the enzyme. This lack of specificity is a serious problem with bioassays of enzymes in a biological fluid, wherein the assayed enzyme is often present in extremely small quantities, e.g. urinary kallikrein has a concentration normally in the range of about 150 nanograms of kallikrein ml in urine normally in the range of 50 300 micrograms of protein ml. In a biological sample, e.g. urine or plasma, the likelihood that the ligand interacts substantially with undesired proteins is high. For example, diisopropylfluorophosphate DFP is known to react with a specific serine hydroxyl group in acetyl cholinesterase Means, G.E. et al., Chemical Modification of Proteins Holden Day, Inc. 1971 , p. 26 , yet it will react with a wide variety of enzymes for example serine pro teases present in urine. Bioassays measure biological effects but tend to be tedious, may require expensive animal preparations, are imprecise, and typically rely on hydrolysis of unknown and variable concentrations of native substrates. Radioimmunoassays often provide the greatest sensitivity coupled with good specificity. However, immunoassays generally fail to distinguish active enzyme from inactive enzyme, enzyme precursor s EMI2.1 or enzyme bound inhibitor. Furthermore, radioimmunoassay requires labelled enzyme or labelled antibody, neither of which is inexpensive to prepare and store. The present invention provides two sources of specificity for an assay of any protease also known as proteinase for which naturally occurring proteinaceous inhibitors are available, whereas previous methods generally provided only one source of specificity. By binding a protease with a tagged inhibitor, i.e. a tagged proteinaceous inhibitor of natural origin, to form protease inhibitor complexes, then adding anti protease antibodies, separating protease inhibitor complexes bound to antibody from the tagged inhibitor, and determining the amount of tag in either the bound or free fraction, the sensitivity of the radioimmunoassay is maintained and the specificity for the active form of a protease is improved.It will be understood that one source of specificity in the protease assay of this invention is the particular binding characteristics of the anti protease, the other is the particular binding characteristics of the tagged proteinaceous inhibitor. Furthermore, the present invention is completely different from the sandwich assay. The sandwich assay is a method of determining the concentration of an antigen, e.g. a protease, by binding the antigen to its corresponding antibody in solid phase, then adding tagged purified antibody Kabat,E.A. Structural Concepts in Immunology and limaunochemistry 2nd Ed. Holt, Rinehart and Winston 1976 p. 75 Salmon, S.E.et al. J. Immunol. 103, 129 1969 J. The essential differences are that 1 the sandwich assay requires the use of a tagged 125 purified antibody, preferably I affinity purified antibody, an expensive and very unstable reagent to make in the laboratory, 2 the sandwich assay does not use a tagged proteinaceous inhibitor of proteases, and 3 the sandwich assay is not an activity assay for an enzyme, particularly a protease. U.S. Patent No. 4,134,792 describes a specific binding assay with an enzyme modulator as a labeling substance. The modulator is an inhibitor or allosteric effector and appears to be understood as any simple organic reagent, not a proteinaceous inhibitor. Furthermore, this patent describes an assay substantially different from that of the present invention because the inhibitor is measured by determining the change in the activity of the enzyme, whereas the present invention determines the enzyme by measuring the amount of tagged inhibitor bound to the enzyme. Several other patents describe methods of isolating naturally occurring proteinaceous inhibitors of proteases or conversely, methods of isolating enzymes that are known to have affinity for such proteinaceous inhibitors of proteases.See, inter alia U.S. Patent Nos. 3,181,997 3,558,773 3,630,841 3,834,990 4,030,977. Since these patents describe purification schemes and do not employ a tag on the inhibitor or the enzyme, it is apparent that the novel assay procedure of the present invention is a clearly different and novel use of naturally occurring proteinaceous inhibitors of proteases. The present invention retains the well known sensitivity of a radioimmunoassay, but substantially avoids the undesired measurement of denatured enzyme. The present invention avoids the pitfalls typically found in the performance of a radioimmunoassay or a sandwich assay, i.e. preparation of labelled enzyme or of labelled antibody. Enzyme inhibitors, particularly proteinaceaous inhibitors, tend to be highly stable and require less expense and time for isolation than the proteases which they bind. Hence it is generally easier to prepare labelled inhibitors than labelled protease. It is well known that labelled, highly purified antibodies are unstable they tend to break down or denature rapidly even during storage below 6DOC. A wide variety of plasma proteases have naturally occurring proteinaceous inhibitors. Many of the plasma proteins are of substantial importance in the clinical evaluation of disease.They are, for example, involved in blood coagulation, blood clot dissolution, formation and destruction of peptide hormones, complement cascade activation Laskowski et a.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 49, 593 1980 , and other important natural functions. The present invention encompasses a new and better method of assaying these proteases by measuring their capacity to bind to both a tagged proteinaceous inhibitor and to a specific anti protease antibody or other appropriately specific binding partner of the protease. The present invention affords a novel and useful method for measuring with great specificity protease in an active conformation by means of a tagged proteinaceous inhibitor which binds to the protease to be assayed. The proteinaceous inhibitor is of natural origin. The selection of proteinaceous inhibitor depends on what protease is to be assayed. The method of the present invention encompasses a highly specific assay with the following steps incubation of protease or sample containing protease with tagged proteinaceous inhibitor to form a mixture of tagged inhibitor protease complexes and free tagged inhibitor, separation of these complexes from the free tagged inhibitor, and measurement of the amount of tag in the complex or measurement of the amount of tag in the free tagged inhibitor. In many instances, antiprotease antibody is added to the mixture to increase the specificity of the assay and or to enhance the separation of these complexes from free tagged inhibitor. The method has clear applicability to the measurement of minute quantities of clinically significant, conformationally active proteases found in plasma, urine and other tissues, e.g. thrombin, renin and kallikrein. The method also does not require as much expense and time to prepare the necessary reagents as compared to previous methods e.g. radioimmunoassay and the sandwich assay. This invention encompasses novel methods of assaying undenatured proteases, also called undenatured proteinases, wherein natural pep tides that act as inhibitors of proteases are tagged, then bound to the protease to form a complex.To be detectably bound to the protease, the inhibitor of the protease should generally have a binding constant between about 105 and about 1015 liters mole. As an additional source of specificity in the assay, it is preferable to use an antibody specific for the protease assayed. This antibody can also provide an easy and convenient method of separating protease bound to the tagged inhibitor of protease from free inhibitor of protease, since the tagged inhibitor of protease is understood to lack substantially detectable interaction with the anti protease antibody. The inhibitors of proteases in this invention, hereinafter proteinaceous inhibitors or inhibitors, are naturally occurring small proteins that are known to inhibit the catalytic activity of oiologically active proteases. The molecular weight of these small proteins varies from about 1,000 daltons to about 30,000, but may be substantially higher. The low molecular weight contributes to their stability and availability. The most preferable inhibitors are listed in Table 1. The inhibitors include, but are not limited to proteinaceous inhibitors of the following classes of proteases serine proteinases, thiol proteinases, carboxyl proteinases, and metallo proteinases. One of the most important of these classes is the serine proteinases, the proteinaceous inhibitors for which can be divided up into the families listed in Table 2. Aprotinin, also known as Trasylol Trademark ofBayer is a member of Family I of Table 2, that is bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor Kunitz family. Some natural sources for proteinaceous inhibitors of the thiol, carboxyl and metallo proteinases are listed in Table 3.For further information on other proteinaceous inhibitors, methods of isolation, amino acid sequences, amino acid compositions, binding specificities, see, inter alia, Laskowski et al., Ann.

It will be understood that a2 macroglobulins are not included in the present invention. Because of their size 720,000 daltons these proteins are known to bury or cover substantially all antigenic determinants upon binding to protease. Hence anti protease antibodies, which will not bind an a2 macroglobulin protease complex, cannot be used to Table IProtease Inhibitor human glandular kallikrein aprotinin renin pepstatin activated Hageman factor popcorn inhibitor plasma kallikrein soybean trypsin inhibitor trypsin soybean trypsin inhibitor trypsin a1 antitrypsin throb in hirudin cathepsin D pepstatin pepsin pepstatin throb in antithrombin III in presence of heparin .activated C1 C1 inactivatorTable 2 Families of protein inhibitors that inhibit serine proteinases I.

The 2 macroglobulins are also less preferable inhibitors because their binding specificities for proteases are substantially broader than, for example, proteinaceous inhibitors of the serine proteinases. For details, seeLaskowski et al., supra. It will also be understood that the scope of inhibitors of the present invention does not include proteinases that inhibit other proteinases by digesting them, e.g. chymotrypsin digestion of trypsin or trypsin digestion of chymotrypsin.The inhibitors of the present invention have only substrates that are enzymes with detectable proteolytic activity. For details, see Laskowski et al., supra. The present invention requires that a tag be attached to the proteinaceous inhibitor. A radioactive tag is preferred, 125I example l2Si, 1311, 3H or 14C, or any other radioisotope easily and conveniently measured. Tritium labeling of proteins, for example, can be carried out with 3H acetic anhydride, a well known reagent frequently used for this purpose. The isotope 125I is the most preferred because of its high specific radio activity and because of its relatively long half life. A proteinaceous inhibitor can be labelled with 125I to a specific activity of about 50 micro Ci microgram of protein by one of a variety of methods known in the art such as e.g. lactoperoxidase, chloramine T Hunter, W. H. et al. Nature 194, 495 1962 , Iodogen Fraker, P.J. et al. Biochem.Biophys. Res. Comm. 80, 849 1978 , or Bolton Hunter reagent Bolton, A.E. et al. Biochem. J. 133, 529 1973 . The labelled protein is separated from unreacted free 125I by gel filtration. The preferred method of radioactively labelling proteins containing tyrosine is chloramine T. It is the most frequently used method of labelling proteins with a radioactive tag.Alternatively, one can label tyrosine residues with tritium by the two step process of first reacting protein with NaI, then catalytically dehydrogenating with tritium gas. If lysine or arginine is not involved in the interaction of proteinaceous inhibitor with protease, then the free amino group of the side chains of these amino acids can be labelled with H acetic anhydride or with Bolton Hunter reagent. Aprotinin is known to contain 4 tyrosine residues Huber, R. et al. Naturwissen 57, 389 1970 , and labelling with chloramine T does not substantially reduce its binding to kallikrein. Bolton Hunter or 3H acetic anhydride labelling does not work, possibly because of acylation of the Lys15 residue known to be required for the formation of the inhibitor protease complex Huber, R. supra 1970 . Labelling aprotinin with chloramine T is preferred to the twostep reacton with NaI and 3H gas because 125I or 131I have much higher specific radio activities than tritium. Pepstatin, an inhibitor listed in Table 1, is known to have a free amino group but no tyrosine residue Aoyagi, T.et al.in Reich, E. et al eds. Proteases and Biological Control, Cold Spring Harbor 1975 pp. 429 4543. Since substitution of the free amino group with a variety of alkanoyl groups does not affect inhibiting activity, then the Bolton Hunter and 3H acetic anhydride are each most likely to work as labelling reagents. A large variety of other tags can be employed instead of radioactive ones. Other methods of tagging the inhibitor include attachment of a fluorogen, chromophore, enzyme or luminescent tag. For example horse radish peroxidase or beta galactosidase may be coupled to the proteinaceous inhibitor by many of the methods discussed in Kennedy, J.H.et al., Clinica Chimica Acta 70, 1 19i6 . Fluorescein isothiocyanate is a well known fluorogenic group that can be attached to proteins Ackroyd, J.F. ed., Immunological Methods,Blackwells Oxford 1964 pp. 155 174 . The incubation of protease with tagged inhibitor can lead to the formation of detectable tagged inhibitor protease complexes under a variety of conditions. Preferably, a quantity of tagged inhibitor is used that is in excess of the quantity of protease, since there is thought to be a simple and rapid equilibrium between protease and free inhibitor on the one hand and the complex on the other taskowski et al, supra .Because the equilibrium constant for the association of protease and its proteinaceous inhibitor is extremely high in the range of 107 1013 liters mole , incubation to equilibrium is a rapid method of assaying the protease of this invention.Equilibrium can be experimentally determined, for example, as the time of incubation after which complex formation does not detectably increase or decrease. This invention also encompasses incubation conditions that are far from equilibrium, wherein it is possible to incubate a quantity of protease in excess of the quantity of tagged inhibitor and still be able to quantify the amount of protease. What should be avoided are conditions wherein substantially all of the tagged inhibitor would be bound to the proteases, i.e. there would be undetectable changes in binding of inhibitor to its protease with small changes e.g. increasing or decreasing by a factor of 0.5 in the concentration of protease. For a general discussion on kinetics as it can be applied to the interaction of pro teases and their inhibitors see Lehninger, A.L. Biochemistry Worth New York pp. t86 l95, and Laskowski et al, supra. In addition to a proteinaceous inhibitor of proteases, and a tag attached to it, measurement of proteases with this reagent also requires a method of separating tagged inhibitor bound to enzyme, also called inhibitor protease complexes, from the tagged inhibitor. Typically there is an excess of tagged inhibitor with respect to the concentration of enzyme. The preferable method of separating inhibitor protease complexes from free inhibitor is to react the mixture of inhibitor and protease with an antiserum specific for the protease. The antiserum provides a second source of specificity for the assay, but it is contemplated that some inhibitors of this invention are specific enough for the pro tease to render use of anti protease antibody unnecessary. Substantial quantities about 1 liter of antiserum with high titer of anti protease antibodies can be made with about 100 micrograms of purified protease, an amount often not prohibitively expensive or time consuming to obtain.It will be understood that a variety of immunization protocols can be employed to obtain such antisera, in this case antisera specific for any one of the proteases of this invention.These protocols are well known to practicing immunologists, and can be illustrated, by way of examples, as an emulsion of about a one to one ratio v v of protease 1 mg ml with complete Freund s adjuvant, or an emulsion of about a one to one ratio of protease 1 mg ml with incomplete Freund s adjuvant. In the preferred mode of the invention, protease is injected into rabbits on a low dose injection schedule about 10 micrograms per injection . If an antibody is used in the assay of this invention, and it preferably is, there are a large variety of methods to separate protease bound to antibody from unbound protease. One of the simplest approaches is to precipitate the antibody with an anti antibody, also called a double antibody. Generally, precipitation with double antibody can be performed by adding enough non specific antiserum to the anti protease antibody to raise the concentration of precipitable antibody to near the equivalence zone, then adding the anti antibody. Alternatively, and preferably, one can use anti antibody covalently bound to an insoluble support, such as e.g. bromoacetyl cellulose, acrylamide beads with azide groups attached, or agarose beads esterified with N hydroxysuccinimide.Packing and settling by these solid phase immunoadsorbents can be assisted by the addition of milk of magnesia. Among other known techniques for separating pro tease bound to antibody from unbound protease are those using solid support matrices, wherein glass, silica or unitary plastic inserts are used to fix one component of the antigen antibody pair. An antibody attached to an insoluble support is thought to bind its antigen virtually irreversibly, unlike a double antibody, which is in solution.Another well known technique is to insolubilize the double antibody itself, usually by cross linking with glutaraldehyde. Another approach is to bring down antibody or anti antibody with protein A preferably either in the form of the whole cellS. aureus or in the form of the purified protein conjugated to an insoluble support, e.g. protein A Sepharose CL 4B Instead of using another protein with a binding affinity for the anti enzyme antibody, one can precipitate the antienzyme antibody with salts such as ammonium sulfate or zirconyl phosphate z gel , or with polyethylene glycol. Among other known techniques are those using solid support matrices, also known as a solid phase assay whereIn glass, silica or plastic beads br unitary plastic inserts are used to fix one component of the antigen antibody pair. An alternative embodiment of this invention is to separate protease tagged inhibitor complexes from free tagged inhibitor without an anti protease antibody. The specificity of the inhibitor should be demonstrated to be solely for the protease assayed before one can dispense with the use of the anti protease.Unfortunately, many of the inhibitors of this invention bind to more than one protease, e.g. al proteinase inhibitor binds to al protease and to trypsin. Hence the safest and most specific way to assay proteases in body fluids or in other tissue samples is to employ an anti protease antibody as an additional source of specificity in the assay of this invention. Methods of separating inhibitor protease complexes from free protease and free inhibitor include the well known biochemical techniques of anion exchange chromatography with e.g. DEAE cellulose and a salt gradient, cation exchange chromatography with e.g. carboxymethyl cellulose and a salt gradient, gel filtration with e.g. Sephadex G 25 or Bio GelP 200, and equilibrium dialysis. Equilibrium dialysis will work with only small peptide inhibitors of the invention, e.g.pepstatin, because larger inhibitors cannot penetrate the pores of a dialysis membrane. Example 1 125Assay of human urinary kallikrein with I labelled aprotinin Aprotinin was reacted with Na125I by the method of Hunter, 125W.M. and Greenwood, F.C. Nature 194, 495 496 1962 to yield Iaprotinin at a specific radioactivity of 80 pCi g. The labelled aprotinin and pure human urinary kallikrein were dissolved separately in the assay buffer, 0.05 M Tris HC1, pH 7.4, plus 0.1 gelatin. Antibody specific for human urinary kallikrein was covalently bound to Affi gel BioRad Laboratories and the gel was suspended in the assay buffer. Fresh human urine samples were treated by application of 500 ul of a given sample to a 0.5 x 10 cm column of Sephadex G 25 Pharmacia Fine Chemical equilibrated and developed with the assay buffer.Samples of the first 1.5 ml of buffer to pass through the column after the sample application were assayed for their contents of kallikrein, an enzyme not retained by Sephadex G 25. Each assay tube 125 contained buffer, buffered I aprotinin 100,000 cpm , a measured quantity of pure kallikrein or chromatographed. urine sample, and antibody A fi l beads, all in a total volume or 200 p1. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 370C for 2 hours and then 50 ul of milk of magnesia Sterling Drugs was added to each tube. Milk of magnesia assists in the packing of insoluble polymeric beads such as Affi gel. The tubes were assayed for 1251 by gamma counting and then were centrifuged.The supernatant of each was removed by decantation, and the precipitate was assayed for 125I aprotinin bound to kallikrein bound to antibody covalently bound to Affi gel, in milk of 125 magnesia . Results, expressed as binding of I cpm of the precipitate s c.p.m. of the total reaction mixture x 100 , are shown in the Table.

Incubation conditions, buffers and washing are according to Catt et al. 131Science 158, 1570 1967 . I pepstatin about 100,000 cpm, 90 pCi ug in 10 ijl of assay buffer 0.05 M Tris HC1 buffer pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 gelatin is then added. Unlabelled pepstatin is available from Sigma Chemical Co. Then 190 1 of either buffer, pure renin in buffer or anticoagulant treated plasma diluted 1 100 in buffer is added to yield a total volume of 200 p1. The reaction mixtures are incubated at 370C for 2 hours and then the tubes are washed three times with 1 ml of assay buffer. The tubes are counted in a.gamma counter. Example 3Assay of plasma thrombin with 3H hirudin and anti thrombin antibodies coupled to cellulose Hirudin Sigma Chemical is tritiated with H acetic anhydride to yield a specific activity of 104 105 cpm pg. An antiserum containing anti thrombin antibodies is coupled to bromoacetyl cellulose Miles Laboratories as per Jagendorf, A.T. et al Biochim. Biophys. Acta 78, 516 1963 . Thrombin is inexpensive and can be purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. To a 1.5 ml polypropylene microcentriruge tube Brinkmann is added 10 p1 containing 3,000 cpm of 3H hirudin in assay buffer 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M Nail, 0.1 gelatin , and either 10 pl of purified thrombin 1 1,000 ng in assay buffer, or 10 pl of assay buffer as a control. The tubes are capped and placed in a 37 C water bath for 2 hours. Then 200 l of cellulosecoupled to anti thrombin antibodies about 100 vglml in assay buffer is added to each tube, the mixtures are briefly mixed by hand, and let stand at room temperature 45 minutes.The tubes are centrifuged 5 minutes at 10,000 xg in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge and 125 ul of the supernatant is counted. Example 4 125I labelling of aDrotinin and purification of active conformer Aprotinin Trasylol, trademark of Bayer was labelled by the technique of Hunter et al. Nature 194, 495 1962 . 1 mCi of Na125 I in 20 pl of 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was mixed with 10 pl 25 pg of chloramine T Eastman Kodak in the same buffer. Aprotinin, 2 pg in 10 pl of the buffer, was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 75 sec at 22 C. Na2S205, 100 pg in 40 pg of the buffer, was added to stop the reaction. Labelled aprotinin was separated from 125I by chroma tography 1.15 x 45 cm column on Bio Gel P 2 BioRad Laboratories equilibrated and developed with 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.4 plus 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1 gelatin. Column fractions 1.8 ml fraction were analyzed for radioactivity and for their ability to inhibit the hydrolysis of D Pro Phe Arg 3H benzylamide by apparently pure human urinary kallikrein. D Pro Phe Arg 3H benzylamide from Ventrex Laboratories, Inc. was used in a final concentration of 40 nM in 0.05 M Tris HC1, pH 9.5, essentially as described by Chung et al. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.120A, 115 1979 for Pro Phe Arg H benzylamide. Kallikrein was used in a final concentration of 200 pM. The results showed that there was a peak of inhibiting activity that coincided with the peak of 125I protein eluting in the void volume.

The reaction mixture was continued for 1 hr. at 22 C. The gel was washed 3 times with 15 ml portions of 0.1 M NaHC03. Coupling of IgG was reasonably efficient approx. 79 . The gel was stored in 0.1 M NaHC03, containing,0.02 NaN3 until used.
