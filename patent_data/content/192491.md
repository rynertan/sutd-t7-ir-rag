# A COMBINED, DUAL PLACARD AND LOOP SIGN CHANGEABLE DISPLAY ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A pair of horizontally spaced vertically upright facing channel members are fixably mounted to an underlying horizontal support. An elongated planar base member has longitudinally spaced holes receiving the vertically upright facing channel members and rests on the horizontal support. Brackets affixed to the inside faces of the channel members mount an elongated planar cap member which may be identical to and the mirror image of the planar base member at a vertically spaced position above the base member, being slidably lowered on the channel members, through the longitudinally spaced holes therein. A first endless loop sign is positioned in an axially upright position with its edges in vertical grooves near the peripheries of the base and cap members and sandwiched therebetween to form a first visual display. A placard holding frame assembly sized to facing channel members is slidably mounted within the facing channel members with its lower end mounted to the cap member thereby forming a dual element changeable display.
