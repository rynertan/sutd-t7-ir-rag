# Air cycle thermodynamic conversion system.

## Abstract
An air cycle thermodynamic conversion system com presses a compressible gas in a multi stage compression process with intercoolers 128, 130 between each adjacent pair of compressors 108, 110, 112 . The intercoolers 128, 130 return the compressed gas temperature to about ambient temperature before each succeeding compression operation. The compressed gas is heated in a heat exchanger 76 passing a heated exhaust gas 24 in counterflow with the compressed gas to increase the thermal energy of thereof. A minimum temperature gradient is maintained between the heating compressed gas and the cooling exhaust gas by establishing the two flows such that they both have about equal heat capacities. The heated compress ed gas is expanded in a turbine 130 to produce at least enough torque to drive the multi stage compression system. Additional torque may be produced in the turbine for driving a using process. Alternatively, an excess of heated gas, beyond that required for driving the turbine, may be fed directly to a using process. Further heat capture may make use of the effluent heated medium from the intercoolers as well as the exhaust from the turbine. In the preferred embodiment, the working gas in the compressors, intercool ers and turbine is air.
