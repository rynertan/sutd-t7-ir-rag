# Shoe with a seat for the big toe at the tip end.

## Abstract
In order to permit the foot enclosed by a shoe to repeat the natural movements of the big toe during the deambula tion with bare foot, a shoe is provided comprising in the fore part a seat 6 for the big toe consisting of a sole portion 3 and of a corresponding upper portion which are fully separated from the remaining fore part 9 of the shoe.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Shoe of closed type, comprising a sole 3 and an upper 2 joined to said sole, characterized by comprising means for permitting the free movement, within the shoe, of the big toe with respect to the remaining fingers of the foot in its natural position of deambulation with bare foot, said means comprising a seat 8 for the big toe provided in the tip end or fore part 4 of said shoe, said seat being separated and capable of free movement with resoect to the corresponding portion 9 of the shoe housing all the remaining fingers of the foot. 2. Shoe according to claim 1, characterized in that said seat 8 for the big toe in turn consists of a sole portion and of a corresponding portion 6 of upper, joined to said sole portion, both separated from the remaining part 9 of the shoe tip, the size of said seat 8 being at least equal to that of the same big toe. 3. Shoe according to claim 2, characterized in that said seat 8 comprises, at the shoe tip, a double dividing wall 7 of upper and a slot or longitudinal cut 5 in the sole 3 having a lenght corresponding to that of said double dividing wall, the latter defining on one side the seat 8 for housing the big toe and on the other side the remaining portion 9 of the shoe tip.

## Description
The present invention relates to a shoe closed type, particularly Uelf XbOssiare use, having on the tip end a separate seat for the big toe.The orthopaedically correct position of the foot, and particularly of the big toe, during the deambulation is, as it is well known, that corresponding to the deambulation with bare foot , i.e. the position which the foot does naturally take onto the ground when in a free condition or without shoe.In the conditions of deambulation with bare foot, the importance is observed of the role of the big toe in the deambulation.In fact it fulfills a function of relevant engagement with the ground, thus highly contributing to the power and to the spring of the foot.It is by the way known that if the big toe is even slightly deviated with respect to its natural position with bare foot, the athletic performance during a foot race is affected.However, most of the closed shoes, mainly owing to aesthetic and fashion reasons, have a fore part point like shaped with angled profile. Consequently, the big toe is deviated from its correct rectilinear position, thus causing a permanent deformation of the foot to take place, it being called Allux vagus ,, involving deambulation pain, etc.The trsditional shoes, moreover, do not permit the big toe to be opened wide apart and be moved in vertical direction with respect to the remaining fingers of the foot, as it occurs on the contrary in the orthopaedically correct deambulation, with an attendant diminution of the yield of the deambulation and with a certain numbness of the foot muscles.Consequently the need exists of providing a shoe of closed type, adapted to permit the big toe to perform the natural movements of the deambulation with bare foot.From French Patent No. 2276792 a shoe is proposed in which each finger is housed in a shaped part of the shoe tip, whereby the shoe is strictly resembling to a glove, but for the foot.However, apart from aesthetic considerations, problems exist as regards the manufacturing of such a shoe which is not feasible on an industrial basis.In turn USP 3013564 relates to a sock structure or foot garment in which the big toeIs separated from the remaining fingers, this garment being however considered for use in combination with a standard structure shoe. The purpose of the present invention is that of providing 8 shoe of closed type, adapted to overcome the above mentioned problems and to fulfill the previously stated need which to date did not find a solution in the conventional shoes of this type.These and other purposes are achieved by means of the shoe of closed type according to the invention, which is essentially characterized in that means are provided adapted to permit the free movement of the big toe, within said shoe, with repsect to the remaining fingers of the foot, to take place in the natural position thereof of deambulation with bare foot.According to further features of the invention, said means consist of a seat for the big toe provided at the tip end of the shoe in a separated position with respect to the remaining, part of shoe housing the other fingers of the foot.The separation area consists, according to the invention, of a double wall of upper leather and of a corresponding longitudinal slit in the sole, extending along the big toe, whereby it is separated from the remaining fingers of the foot and made independent as to its movements with respect to the remaining portion of the shoe.The advantageous effects of the present shoe are multiple. In fact it prevents and corrects the forming of the Allux valugs, thus having also the function of a correcting orthopaedic shoe.From the point of view of the foot hygiene, said shoe permits a greater muscle development of the whole foot and of the leg, thanks to the possibility of motion of the big toe promoting the engagement of the foot with the ground. From the point of view of sport, the shoe of the invention, permits greater spring and power to be achieved.The whole is naturally beneficial for a better blood circulation at the foot level, with an increased oxygenation of the tissues and with a contribution to the solution of the problems causing the varicose veins to be formed.The shoe of the present invention shall be now described with reference to the embodiment shown in the enclosed drawings, having exemplifying but non limiting purpose.In the drawings fig. 1 is a perspective view of the shoe of the present invention figs. 2 and 3 show the shoe of fig, 1 in front view with two different position of the big toe with respect to the other fingers of the foot fig. 4 is a plan view particularly of the front part of the shoe of fig. 1 and figs. 5 and 6 are cross section views, respectively according to the lines V V and Vl VI of the shoe of fig. 4.With reference to the said figures, the shoe according to the invention is indicated on the whole by reference lin fig. 1 and essentially comprises an upper 2, of leather or other material, joined to the sole of leather or rubber 3.The fore portion or tip 4 of the shoe 1 figs. 4 to 6 comprises a slit or longitudinal cut 5 in the sole corresponding to the internal profile of the big toe in the shoe. The extension of this slit or depth of the cut 5 is nearly equal to the lenght of the big toe.At the slit 5 of the sole 3, two flaps 6 are provided, facing towards each other, which are joined to the sole 3 at the height of the end portions of the slit 5 fig. 5 . At the tip 4 of the shoe 1 a double wall 7 is thus formed fig. 6 consisting of the opposed flaps 6, of the upper 2, which wall is inserted between the big toe and the second finger of the foot upon wearing the shoe 1. The tip 4 is thus divided by the double wall 7 into two portions or compartments, separated from each other and capable of independent movements from each other the portion 8 forming the seat of the tip of the shoe for housing the big toe and a portion 9 housing the remaining fingers of the foot figs. 4 and 6 . The possibility of vertical movements of the big toe with respect to the other fingers of the foot, or better stated the liberty of relative movements between the separate portions 8 and 9 of the tip 4 of the shoe of the invention are illustrated in the figs. 2 and 3.Besides these vertical movements, also the spreading apart of the big toe with respect to the remaining fingers of the foots is made possible.Thus according to the invention, a closed shoe is provided, permitting the foot, particularly the big toe, to repeat the movements of the deambulation with bare foot.Solutions equivalent to the above described embodiment are possible, without however falling out of the scope of the present invention.
