# A method of generating oxygen for emergency use.

## Abstract
A method of generating oxygen for emergency use wherein oxygen is generated by adding a catalyst such as manganese dioxide etc. to an aqueous solution prepared by intermixing an addition compound of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide with water and wherein the catalyst is formed into a continuous and integral shape so as to thereby make it possible to put the catalyst into and take it out of the aqueous solution so that generation of oxygen can be started and stopped easily.
