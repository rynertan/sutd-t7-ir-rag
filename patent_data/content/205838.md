# High voltage amplifier.

## Abstract
An integrated high voltage amplifier output stage cap able of being manufactured using low voltage processes comprises a plurality of low voltage amplifying means 8 21 , such as a chain of Darlington transistor pairs, con nected between a relatively high voltage source 36 and a current source 34 to provide a common output 35 . A potential divider network 1 7 is connected between the high voltage source 36 and a protective high voltage FET 30 for providing low voltage inputs to each of the amplify ing means. The input signal to the potential divider network 1 7 is then provided from a cascode stage made up of a low voltage transistor 24 and the high voltage FET 30 , all the components being produced by a low voltage process.
