## Description
The present invention relates to a method of producing ferro and nickel boron alloys with a boron content between 1.4 and 15 and 1.39 and 15 by weight respectively, and a product produced by the method. Although not so limited, the method of this invention has particular utility in the production of both crystalline and amorphous boron alloys by in situ reduction of a boron compound in a metallic melt. Boron is a metalloid and exhibits properties of both metals and non metals. Consequently, when boron is employed in an alloy composition, the alloy can be further treated to have properties of metals and or non metals. A ferro boron alloy melt maintains the crystalline structure of iron upon solidification. Boron employed in the alloy will increase strength, hardenability, toughness, drawability, thermal stability and enamelability. Crystalline boron alloys are employed to make, for example, wire or tools. A ferro boron alloy melt containing greater than 1.4 by weight boron can be further treated to form a solid amorphous structure. These amorphous alloys are being investigated for use in electrical applications because it has been found that amorphous ferro boron alloys have lower core loss than conventional silicon steel employed for the same purpose. For example, an amorphous ferro boron alloy containing iron, silicon, and boron may have potential application for making transformers or high frequency switching cores. Boron occurs in many forms such as, for example, boron oxide, boric acid, sodium tetraborate borax , calcium metaborate, colemanite, rasorite, ulexite, probertite, inderite, kernite, kurnakovite and sassolite. These impure compounds are processed to nearly pure boron by mineral processing companies. The boron oxide is converted to an iron boron alloy containing typically 18 boron by special reduction processes. The processed iron boron alloy is sold to foundries and steel plants, as an additive for a ferrous melt as is disclosed in the following patents US A 2616797 also employs a thermite reaction for producing a ferro boron alloy additive containing 1.5 to 2.8 boron by weight which is later added to molten steel to increase strength and hardenability. The alloy additive, when mixed with the steel, contains approximately 0.01 to 0.03 boron by weight. These last two noted patents teach an additive that is employed to make a crystalline ferro boron alloy. Nevertheless, the additive of US A 1562042 can be employed to make an amorphous ferro boron alloy because the additive in briquette form contains 16 boron by weight. The following U.S. patents teach a process for converting a ferro boron alloy containing greater than 1.4 boron by weight into an amorphous alloy. US A 4133679 and 4255189 teach a typical amorphous boron alloy composition containing 6 15 atom percent boron and including either molybdenum or tungsten with the remainder being at least one of iron, nickel, cobalt or manganese. These elements are melted together and spun as a molten jet by applying argon gas at a pressure of 34,47 KPa 5 psi . The molten jet impinges on a rotating surface forming a ribbon which is extracted and further treated. Other patents disclose the use of boron in ferrous melts for a wide variety of purposes as noted by the following patents US A 1027620 and 1537997 disclose the addition of a boron compound to molten iron for the purpose of removing phosphorus, sulfur and nitrogen by chemically reacting boron with these elements found in the iron melt and forming a slag which is removed before pouring. Neither of these references teach recovering the boron from the boron compound such that the boron is capable of alloying with the iron. To the contrary, these references teach chemically reacting the boron to form a slag which is separated from the molten iron. Additionally, 997 teaches reducing the nitrogen content in the melt to less than 0.0015 . DD A 148963 discloses the addition of boron oxide to molten steel in a furnace or ladle to obtain a total boron content of 30 to 160 parts per million. The boron addition acts as a chip breaker and increases machinability of the steel. It is apparent that very little boron is recovered from the boron compound because only a small amount of boron is present in the steel. None of the above mentioned references teach reducing a boron compound with a reductant in a melt to form a boron alloy. Although boron oxide is not employed to make stainless steel, the Argon Oxygen Reactor AOR or the Argon Oxygen Decarburization AOD process to make stainless steel does employ a reductant to reduce chromium, iron or manganese oxides back into the steel melt. This improves the recovery of chromium, iron or manganese over the conventional electric furnace process of making stainless steel. The following reference describes the conventional AOR In the AOR process for stainless steel, usually about 1 2 by weight of the melt is lost to the slag as oxides during the decarburization step and recovery of elements chromium, iron, and manganese from these oxides is very efficient using lime, silicon and sometimes aluminium. Scrap and ferro alloys containing the metallic elements to make stainless steel are a more cost effective source for these elements than using oxide and reductant additions. However, in the case of ferro boron, the reduction of the boron compound in an AOR type vessel using a strong reductant is economically favourable. Theoretically, reduction of one pound of boron from boron oxide requires 1.95 lbs 0.884kg of silicon or 2.50 lbs 1.134kg of aluminium. The reduction of boron oxide using silicon as a reductant in a mixing vessel is not immediately obvious because it is a very stable oxide more stable than chromium oxide and about the same stability as silicon oxide . Also refractory erosion was believed to be a problem when boron oxide would be added to slags at conventional steel making temperatures. Therefore, it has always been the practice of the industry to purchase and employ ferro boron as an additive to the melt. Accordingly, the need exists for a process of reducing inexpensive boron compounds to recover boron which can be alloyed with other metals. GB A 2109819 discloses a process for producing a ferro boron molten metal in a vertical furnace having beds packed with a carbonaceous solid reducing agent. Hot air is blown into the furnace through a plurality of tuyeres in order to introduce boron oxide or boric acid into the furnace at a weight ratio of boron oxide to iron oxide ranging from 0.05 to 0.8. The reducing agent used is carbon. The specific examples of this reference have carbon contents of 3.2 and 3.0 respectively. An object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing a boron containing metallic melt from low cost metallic scrap and low cost boron compounds in conventional refining equipment and with relatively low energy requirements and low process temperatures. The present invention provides a process designed to supersede the intermediate briquette processing and all other prior art processes. The present invention employs relatively impure forms of boron which are added directly to a metallic melt contained in a refining furnace or mixing vessel. If the melt contains a sufficient amount of strong reductants or deoxidizers Si, Al and there is sufficient melt and slag mixing, the boron compound will be reduced in situ. The boron then alloys with the melt. The boron compounds, for example, can be at least one of boron trioxide, boric acid, borax, calcium metaborate, colemanite, rasorite, ulexite, inderite, kernite, kurnakovite, probertite, sassolite, and lesser known forms of borates or borides. The boron alloys of the present invention may contain relatively small amounts of boron for hardenability or other characteristics previously disclosed, or increasingly larger percentages of boron which when further treated, produce what is typically known as glass or amorphous metal alloys. The terms glass or amorphous as used herein mean a state of matter in which the component atoms are arranged in a disorderly array that is, there is no long range order. Such a glass or amorphous alloy material gives rise to broad diffused diffraction peaks when subjected to electromagnetic radiation in the X ray region. This is in contrast to crystalline material, such as steels, having a lower boron content and slower solidification rate in which the component atoms are arranged in an orderly array giving rise to sharp X ray diffraction peaks. Amorphous ferro boron alloys for electromagnetic uses may contain up to 5 boron with a preferred range from about 2.5 to 4.6 boron, and up to 7.34 silicon, in weight percent, with the balance being essentially iron. A more preferred alloy contains 3.0 boron, 5.0 silicon, in weight percent, with the balance being residuals and iron. Thus in its first broadest aspect the present Applicant s invention comprises a process for producing a metallic melt having from 1.4 to 15 boron by weight, which comprises providing a metallic melt containing a boron compound and a reductant, characterised in that said metallic melt is produced by melting ferrous scrap in an induction furnace, an electric furnace, or a basic oxygen furnace, that said reductant is silicon, aluminium, or mixtures thereof, that a sufficient amount of said boron compound is present in said melt to achieve a desired melt containing at least 1.39 boron by weight, and that said melt containing said boron compound and said reductant is vigorously mixed under non oxidising conditions to achieve and sustain substantial equilibrium, to reduce said boron compounds and to alloy boron therein with said metallic melt. In its second broadest aspect, the invention comprises a process for producing a metallic melt having from 1.39 to 15 boron by weight, which comprises providing a metallic melt containing a boron compound and a reductant, characterised in that said metallic melt is produced by melting nickel scrap in an induction furnace, an electric furnace, or a basic oxygen furnace, that said reductant is silicon, aluminium, or mixtures thereof, that a sufficient amount of said boron compound is present in said melt to achieve a desired melt containing at least 1.39 boron by weight, and that said melt containing said boron compound and said reductant is vigorously mixed under non oxidizing conditions to achieve and sustain substantial equilibrium, to reduce said boron compound and to alloy boron therein with said metallic melt. The amount of boron compound being added to the melt would depend upon the final desired percentage of boron in the melt. Generally the recovery of boron from the boron compounds, according to the present invention, is greater than 40 by weight, based upon the amount of boron in the compound. The process of the present invention is designed to be implemented with typical refining equipment such as an induction furnace, an electric furnace, or basic oxygen furnace along with a reaction mixing vessel, or implemented in the furnaces themselves. Reference is made to the accompanying drawing wherein the sole figure is a graphic comparison of the percent boron oxide in a slag with the percent boron in a ferrous melt after completion of the process of the invention. Boron is a common element added to steel to form an alloy containing from about 1.4 to 15 by weight boron or extra strong wire for cables or fencing. Amorphous ferroboron alloys contain from about 1.4 15 boron by weight and have potential as substitute materials for electrical silicon steel used in transformers, for example. Amorphous non ferrous boron alloys can be employed in making semiconductors, cores for magnetic heads, brazing material or razor blades. The present process can be carried out using existing equipment normally found in a steel mill or foundry, such as a basic oxygen furnace, an induction furnace or electric furnace, an AOR and a conventional ladle. Generally, a melt is made in a basic oxygen furnace, an induction furnace, an electric furnace, or the like. When the charge is melted, preferably the slag will be skimmed, held back, or poured off for reasons which are subsequently explained. Although the remaining procedure can be conducted in a furnace equipped with special tuyeres or porous plugs, simple economics dictates the undesirability of employing the furnace for a process that can be conducted in equipment that is less expensive to operate. Consequently, the melt should be duplexed by transferring to a separate vessel for vigorous mixing. Nevertheless, if the melting furnace is employed for the remainder of the process, it is operated just as a mixing vessel with tuyeres or porous plugs, as will be subsequently explained. Another procedure is to decarburize in the mixing vessel, slag off, then start the boron addition practice. The mixing vessel can be a conventional ladle, a ladle with tuyeres or porous plugs, an AOR or the like. Once the mixing vessel is charged with the melt which preferably contains substantially no slag, the other components, such as the reductant, boron compound and slagging agents can be added to the melt independently or simultaneously. The order of adding the other components can be interchangeable without substantially affecting the overall process of the present invention. Nevertheless certain advantages can be gained from adding the other components in a preferred manner. When the melt is tapped into the mixing vessel, it generally contains silicon. The amount of silicon present in the melt is directly related to the amounts of the components which form the melt as is well known to those skilled in the art. For example, electrical steels are generally formed with a high amount of silicon. Because the melt contains some silicon, the preferred manner of adding the components calls first for adding the additional amount of reductants necessary to reduce the boron compound. For reasons to be stated later, the preferred reductant comprises 2 3 Si and 1 3 Al. Some or all the silicon is present in the melt when tapped, making it necessary to add the aluminium and any additional silicon. Because these reductants cause an exothermic reaction when added to the melt, the addition of the reductant at this stage of the process has certain benefits. Chief among those benefits is the increase in temperature of the melt, and the enhanced mixing due to the decreased viscosity of the melt. After the reductants have been added, it is generally preferred to add the boron compound or compounds, simultaneously with the slagging agents. The boron compounds may be anhydrous or calcined to prevent uncontrolled steam blowout from the mixing vessel. In any case, it is generally desirable to employ boron compounds which contain no more than 3 water or CO₂, by weight, based on the total weight of the compounds. Commercially available colemanite or boric acid are the preferred boron compounds. Although colemanite concentrate is less expensive than calcined colemanite because the mineral processor can eliminate the final drying step, it may be more practical to use fully calcined colemanite because of steam and CO₂ out gassing and temperature loss during mixing. Also, colemanite contains lime in about the correct amount necessary to neutralize SiO₂, thus making it possible to minimize or eliminate the lime addition. The slagging agents consist primarily of lime CaO which will neutralize the acidic SiO₂. Lime is added to change the activity of the slag components, to promote the thermo chemical reduction of boron from boron oxide in the slag, and to lower the melting point of the slag. In general, it is desirable to attain at least a 1 1 CaO SiO₂ ratio, after reduction, thereby assuring minimum refractory erosion caused by the SiO₂. In summary, while the order of adding the components is not critical, the preferred procedure is to add the reductant first, and then add the boron compound and the slagging agent. Once all the components have been added, it is necessary to mix the melt vigorously with the components for a period of about between 5 20 minutes, and preferably about 10 minutes. By vigorously mixing it is meant that the metal slag interface movement is sufficient to result in a dynamic balance between the slag and metal as well as the components and the metal, which results in equilibrium condition being reached between the metal and the slag, as shown in Figure 1 for an iron melt in which silicon is the principal reductant for boron oxide. Vigorous mixing is characterized by a rolling movement of the melt whereby the melt from the lower portions of the vessel ascends, while melt from the upper portions is drawn downwardly. Vigorous mixing can be achieved in various ways such as by gas injection, magnetic stirring, mechanical mixing, operator mixing, or the like, or any combination thereof. If the mixing vessel is a ladle, generally the mixing is achieved by inert gas stirring. If the mixing vessel is a small laboratory crucible, an operator can stir the melt with a refractory stirrer. If the mixing vessel is a ladle with tuyeres or poros plugs, or an AOR, mixing may be achieved by injecting a non oxidizing or inert gas, such as argon gas, into the melt. If there is a capacity problem in the mixing vessel, the slagging agent, boron compound and reductant can be split into two or more separate additions, mixing steps, and slag offs. Generally, slag chemistry, appearance and color indicate whether or not the process has proceeded to the desired degree of reduction. For example, if adequate components were initially added to the melt but the boron oxide in the slag is extremely high and the appearance and color are not acceptable as is well known to those skilled in the art, then the desired degree of reduction has not been achieved. Certain components are desired in the slag, such as Al₂O₃ which facilitates mixing and lower the melting point. Thus, the slag chemistry should contain about 10 18 Al₂O₃. Where a reductant of 1 3 Al and 2 3 Si is employed in a mixing vessel having a magnesium oxide refractory lining, a typical slag should contain 10 to 18 Al₂O₃, 25 to 35 CaO, 25 to 35 SiO₂, 5 to 15 MgO and 5 to 25 B₂O₃. A more typical slag containing 15 Al₂O₃, 30 CaO, 30 SiO₂, 8 MgO with the balance being substantially B₂O₃ has a good slag basicity ratio CaO SiO₂ 1 , the proper amount of Al₂O₃, and a metal chemistry containing about 2.85 boron. The drawing illustrates an experimentally determined equilibrium curve between the boron oxide in the slag and the boron in a ferrous melt when silicon is the principal reductant and does not exceed 5.3 silicon in the final melt. In order to achieve 3 boron in a melt, the boron oxide in the slag must be above 18 . As is illustrated, the higher the boron in the melt, the higher the of boron oxide in the slag at equilibrium conditions. Because the reductant reduces less stable oxides in the slag before it reduces the boron oxides boron oxide is very stable compared to other oxides , including ferrous oxides , it is important to remove substantially all the slag incurred during melting the metal. This will also help to minimize the total slag volume. With a fixed equilibrium boron oxide concentration the amount of boron oxide left in the slag is directly related to the slag volume. Consequently, less boron oxide will be necessary to achieve the final boron content in the melt with no residual furnace slag. If the slag from the melt, after the final equilibrium is achieved in the mixing vessel, is recycled to a subsequent heat, it can serve as a source for boron. The percent boron oxide level of the slag can be reduced to a lower equilibrium level because of the lower percent boron content of the new heat. As disclosed above, this intermediate slag would preferably be skimmed off before making the final boron compound addition. The selection of the deoxidant or reductant AL, Si is very important. The reduction reaction for the most common elements C, Si and Al are shown as Silicon is the least expensive exothermic reductant theoretically 1.95 lbs 0. 884kg of Si required to reduce 1 lb 0.453kg of boron from the slag , the boron oxide reduction reaction 2 is thermodynamically more favourable at lower temperatures, and the reaction is exothermic. However, reaction 2 adds an acid component SiO₂ to the slag which requires lime CaO to neutralize it. Also, too much silica in the slag slows down reaction 2 because the thermodynamic activity of SiO₂ in the slag is increased, thus driving the reaction to the left which retards the reduction of B₂O₃. Because aluminium is the most expensive theoretically 2.5 lbs 1.134kg of Al is required to reduce 1 lb of boron from the slag of the three most common reductants, it is generally not employed as the sole reductant. Yet, aluminium has characteristics which are favourable to the overall process. First, the boron oxide reduction reaction 3 is exothermic like reaction 2 , and second, it does not attack most refractory linings in furnaces, AOR and ladles, and third, it is the strongest reductant of the three common reductants. The preferred reductant Comprises 2 3 Si and 1 3 Al because a reductant comprising all aluminium is too expensive and results in too great a final aluminium content for amorphous electrical melts, while a reductant comprising all Si forms additional SiO₂ in the slag which must be neutralized by additional lime to prevent refractory erosion. Also, too much silica in the slag retards the reduction of B₂O₃ as previously explained. In forming a ferrous amorphous alloy, it is well known that aluminium present in the alloy should be as low as possible, preferably less than 0.010 by weight, because aluminium causes nozzle plugging and a crystalline phase formation during strip casting. Therefore, adding aluminium to the melt would cause a higher content of aluminium in the alloy, according to conventional thinking. However, when aluminium reduces the B₂O₃, Al₂O₃ is formed and becomes part of the slag. Al₂O₃ in the slag is desirable because it fluidizes the slag, thus helping to achieve a metal slag equilibrium. The preferred slag contains about 15 Al₂O₃, which can be substantially achieved by employing about 1 3 of the reductant as aluminium to recover approximately 1 3 of the boron. Consequently, the preferred reductant is approximately 1 3 Al and 2 3 Si. The amount of deoxidizer or reductant can easily be determined by mass balance. For example, when using boron oxide as the boron compound and aluminium as the deoxidizer, B₂O₃ 2 Al Al₂O₃ 2B, twice the molar amount of aluminium is necessary to theoretically reduce each mole of boron oxide to boron. Thus, by knowing the amount of boron oxide that is necessary to yield a specific amount of boron in an alloy, the amount of reductant can be calculated by mass balance. In order to form an amorphous material, the ferro boron alloys containing greater than 1.4 by weight boron or the non ferrous boron alloys are deposited, in a molten metal phase, onto a moving chill body surface. Depositing the molten metal onto the surface of the chill body is usually accomplished by forcing the molten metal through a nozzle located adjacent the surface of the chill body. A thin strip of molten metal is instantly formed and solidified into an amorphous metal strip. A strip is a slender body whose thickness is very small compared to its length and width, and includes such bodies as sheets, filaments, or ribbons as is known in the prior art. The critical physical parameters for forming an amorphous strip are the size of the orifice of the nozzle, the velocity of the chill body surface and the quenching rate of the molten metal. Generally the orifice of the nozzle is slit like or oblong with the length of the orifice forming the width of the amorphous strip, that is, the length of the orifice is adjacent to and parallel with the width of the chill surface. In general, there is no limitation on the length of the orifice, but the width is from about 0.3 to about 2 millimeters. Typically the chill body is a rotating wheel on the outer surface of which the molten metal is deposited. Although any moving chill body will suffice, it is the velocity of the deposition surface that is of critical importance. Conventionally, the chill surface must have a velocity in the range from about 100 to about 2000 meters per minute. Lastly, the chill body must be cold enough to quench the molten metal at a rate of at least about 10⁴ C sec. to form an amorphous solid strip. The quench rate must be very rapid to prevent the metal from arranging itself in a crystalline form as normally occurs with a slower solidification rate. All percentages are weight percent based on the total melt weight. The iron and ferro silicon were melted in a 1000 lb 453. 6kg capacity air induction furnace. The ferrous melt was tapped at high temperatures through a tundish into a 1000 lb 453.6kg capacity refractory lined mixing vessel which had been equipped with a single commercial porous plug in the bottom, for injecting the argon gas. The heats were tapped as hot as possible to overcome the relatively high thermal losses, partially due to the small heat sizes. The slagging agents and boron compound were premixed and some premelted separately in a graphite lined induction furnace. Part of the reductant was contained in the initial melt and part added to the mixing vessel. On some heats, premelted slagging agents were added to the mixing vessel during vessel preheating to make the slagging agents as hot as possible before introducing the melt. The balance of the premixed slagging material and the reductants were added to the mixing vessel after tapping the melt. The slag metal components were mixed thoroughly to promote reduction of the B₂O₃ and to control the final tap temperature. The liquidus temperature of the 5 Si 3 B melt was determined to be approximately 2100 F 1148 C . The aim for the initial melt silicon on each heat was 3 6 . On the first heat, enough boron containing slag was added to aim theoretically for 1 boron in the bath. On second heat, a boron containing ingot was remelted and then a slag addition was made to increase the melt to 2 boron. The ingot from the second heat was remelted as the starting material for the third heat and the boron was increased, using this process, to 3 . Reference is made to Tables 1 and 2 in the following review of each heat. It should be noted that the chemistry of the melt was not available while the heats were being made, thus best guess was sometimes used in deciding what to do during the making of the heat i.e. bubbling time, additional material etc. . On this heat, 83 lbs 37. 65kg of components 43 CaO, 43 B₂O₃, 10 Al₂O₃ and 5 CaF₂ , were added to a 900 lb 408.24kg ferrous melt with 6 silicon and bubbled with argon. The slag basicity and Al₂O₃ level were increased to improve boron oxide reduction. The slag components had been premelted and poured into a steel can which was then preheated before adding to the vessel. The vessel had a much better refractory preheat and the temperature drop during bubbling was greatly reduced. See Table 1. Temperature loss was 10 20 F 5.55 to 91.1 C min which was typical of previous bubbling experiments in this small vessel. Final metal analysis was 4.2 Si and 0.66 B with the remainder being essentially iron for a boron recovery of 57 . The melt was cast into a mold forming a crystalline ingot. The final slag basicity was 0.94 and contained 7.6 B₂O₃. This heat does not provide an alloy in accordance with the invention, but serves to produce a B containing metal charge for the process of the invention. Referring to Tables 1 and 2 the ingot from Heat 1 760 lbs 344.73kg was remelted with additional iron and ferro silicon in the 1000 lb 453.6kg induction furnace and yielded metal chemistry of 6.8 Si and 0.55 B. Double the quantity of the same oxide components compared with Heat 1 were premixed into a steel can and preheated before adding to the mixing vessel. The final metal chemistry was 4.1 Si and 1.73 B with the balance being essentially iron for a boron recovery of 53 . This metal chemistry is suitable for making amorphous materials upon further processing. Final slag chemistry was 40 CaO, 31 SiO₂, 7 Al₂O₃ and 15 B₂O₃. Reduction of this larger quantity of slag was not as efficient as Heat 1, which could have been the result of a larger slag volume, the higher boron level in the metal, and or the lower alumina level. Temperature drop during reduction was typical and the heat was poured into a mold at 2470 F 1354 C with no problems. This alloy could be further treated, including chill casting, to form an amorphous material. The ingot from Heat 2 1.73 B was remelted with additional iron and ferro silicon to a melt chemistry shown at 0 minutes in Table 1. The 900 lb 408.24kg heat was tapped at 3050 F 1676 C into the preheated mixing vessel which already contained lime, alumina, boron oxide, and spar see Table 2 . The slag and metal were stirred by argon injection for 22 minutes metal and slag chemistries and bath temperatures are shown in Table 1. Results indicate that the B₂O₃ reduction reaction with silicon was complete in about 12 minutes. The boron level of the melt increased from 1.4 to 2.7 at a silicon content of 5.0 . After 15 minutes of mixing, 4 lbs 1.8kg of aluminium .4 was added to the molten slag metal bath and stirred for another 8 minutes. From the data in Table 1 it can be seen that after the aluminium addition, the B and Si contents of the metal bath increased, from 2.73 to 2.85 and from 4.97 to 5.11 , respectively. The final metal chemistry was 2.80 boron, 5.13 silicon with the remainder being essentially iron. This chemistry, upon further processing is capable of forming an amorphous alloy for electrical applications. The slag Al₂O₃ content increased slightly while the B₂O₃ and SiO₂ level in the slag dropped. Due to the exothermic aluminium reduction reaction, the bath temperature did not continue to fall at the normal rate 20 F min 11.1 C min , but actually increased 20 F 11.1 C after the Al addition. After making this heat, it was concluded that the 3 B level can be reached at least by using three reduction steps Heats 1, 2, 3 . It was decided to attempt to use a single step to achieve the 3 B level in the next heat. In this heat, the premixed preheated components in the vessel had no alumina or spar see Table 2 . Heat size was also reduced to 560 lbs 254kg to reduce the volume problems encountered in previous heats. Aluminium 15 lbs 6.8kg and silicon 25 lbs 11. 3kg were added to the vessel after tapping from the furnace. As can be seen in Table 1, the Al and Si did supply Al₂O₃ 17 and SiO₂ 29 to the slag while reducing the B₂O₃ level from 61 to 18 at 20 minutes . The basicity CaO SiO₂ of the slag was 1.0. At 20 minutes the metallic boron level was 2.96 with 4.8 Si. Following the reduction step, the slag metal was too hot to tap and it was decided to add additional anhydrous boric acid 38 lbs 17.23kg of B₂O₃ . No additional lime, silicon, or aluminium was added with this late boron oxide material. The metallic boron level increased from 2.96 up to 3.50 and the silicon level dropped from 4.8 down to 3.5 . Slag chemistry data Table 1 also indicated a higher B₂O₃ level and also the slag had become more acid due to the increased SiO₂ from the reduction reaction. The sulfur content of the heat was built to 0.039 in the induction furnace and after 32 minutes of mixing in the mixing vessel it was 0.0006 . The nitrogen finished very low at .0005 . After 20 minutes mixing the boron level was 2.96 for a boron recovery of 59 . This alloy could be further treated to form amorphous material. The next heat was made to illustrate the employment of calcined colemanite as the primary boron compound. Calcined colemanite was the major source of B₂O₃ for this heat. Commercially available calcined colemanite had been further calcined at 1600 F 871 C to drive off the residual CO₂. As a consequence of this added step, the density of the calcined colemanite was very low. This heat did not employ the premixing and preheating step employed in other heats. It took 9 minutes to add all the slag components slagging agents, boron compound and reductant . Additions to the vessel were complete in 2 minutes on previous heats. The reductant included 34 lbs 15.4kg of silicon and 19 lbs 8.62kg of aluminium. To achieve the proper boron oxide addition 26 lbs 11. 79kg of B₂O₃ were also added. The heat was tapped shortly after all the other components were added 15 min because the temperature had dropped to 2170 F 1187 C , which is close to the liquidus temperature of 2100 F 1148 C . The metal analysis indicated a high percent of Si, and slag chemical analysis yielded a high percent of B₂O₃ and a low percent SiO₂. This again indicates the importance of sufficient mixing to achieve metal slag equilibrium, i.e. 3 boron and 5 silicon in the melt and 18 B₂O₃ in the slag. Boron recovery for this short mixing time was only 43 . This experiment illustrated the ability to make a non ferrous boron alloy by the same single step boron reduction procedure. A 50 lb 22. 68kg nickel base metallic charge with following analysis was melted and other components including a premelted slag Table 1 were added with extra silicon and aluminium and mechanically stirred for reduction of the boron oxide. The final metal chemistry was 79. 3 Hi, 5.5 Fe, 7.8 Si, and 1.39 B. Slag chemistry indicated a residual B₂O₃ of 37.8 . These analyses indicate that about 30 40 of the B₂O₃ was reduced from the slag. As with Heat 9, some of the slag reacted with the MgO crucible and this lowered the boron recovery values. From the various examples, it will be evident that some critical factors in the procedure of the present invention are important to produce the desired product, such as proper heat size relative to the mixing vessel size, very good mixing, careful temperature control and proper additions of the alloys and slagging agents. It is preferred to provide a non oxidizing atmosphere above the melt during mixing, although a slag cover of sufficient volume may provide adequate protection against oxidation by air. With regard to careful temperature control, preheating the components greatly decreases the temperature drop during th boron oxide reduction. Also, preheating the slag greatly improves the rate of dissolving the slag into the melt. Both are particularly important when operating on a small scale. However, it is probaqbly not necessary to premix or premelt the slag components on a commercial scale, i.e., greater than 25 tons 25415kg . Temperature can be partially controlled by proper selection of the reduction materials.
