# Electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell includes an anode and a cathode electrochemically coupled by an electrolyte, means such as porous electrochemically non conductive material placed within the anode and cathode to permit minimal electrode separation, and a cell housing which can be sealed hermetically or non hermetically. According to the invention a novel electrochemical cell comprises a sealed non metallic pouch of thin flexible material which forms a cell housing of deformable configuration to render the cell adaptable to varying battery configurations as well as cell shapes. A second feature includes a novel feedthrough arrangement wherein a pair of electrically conductive members are located on respective sides of an interjacent through hole formed in the housing material. The pair of electrically conductive members are coupled through the through hole to form the feedthrough. A method for making these novel electrochemlcal cells is provided.
