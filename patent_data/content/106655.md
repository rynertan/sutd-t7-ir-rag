# MODIFIED UNSATURATED POLYESTER RESINS

## Abstract
The present invention relates to unsaturated polyester resin compositions modified by addition of a copolymeris able monomer and an epoxy resin to improve the physical properties of the composition. The copolymerisable monom er is one or more unsaturated organic compounds selected from carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid anhydrides, amines, amides, alcohols and thiols and the composition also contains an epoxy resin. The copolymerisable monomer may be a mixture of the unsaturated organic compound and a vinyl monomer selected from styrene, methyl methacrylate and vinyl toluene. The compositions after cure are particular ly suitable for producing glass fibre reinforced polymers to be made into shapes eg by wet lay up without use of compression moulds, or as sheet moulding compounds for construction of eg car bodies.
