## Description
DESCRIPTION This invention relates to a system and method for improving the operation of computers and computing systems, part ticularly with respect to the security and confidentiality of information contained and entered therein. A number of major problems exist in the operation of computers and computing systems. One of such problems involves the unauthorized attainment of data from the computer or com puting system. Another problem is involved with the entry of data into a computer or memory associated with a computing system, which data is either incorrect due to an operators error or is false as a result of an attempt to commit 2raud and falsify records. The instant invention is concerned with a computer system in which fraud is substantially reduced or, if permitted may be easily detected as to its source. The system also provides for means for assuring that confidential data stored therein is available only to persons authorized to view or receive same. A primary feature of the instant invention involves the identification of all persons who enter data into a com puter and preferably, although not necessarily, all persons 4who receive data from the computer or, 9n a specialized form, all persons who receive confidentiPl data from the computer. Such identification may be effected in a number of manners including the automatic electronic recognition of a particular feature of the person about to enter or receive data with respect to the computer or computer memory.Such recognition may be effected by the electronic analysis of a person s voice signals generated when the person spears into a microphone, the automatic electrooptical scanning of a persons fingerprint presented by the person to a scanning location, the automatic electro optical or otherwise effected scanning of the dimensions of a person s hand including the fingers thereof, the electro optical scanning of a persons face from one or more directions or the scanning of any other body feature of the person wherein the analog signals derived from said scanning are digitized and are compared with signals derived from a memory which were originally recorded in such memory from signals .derived in similar scans of the same person.Such identification results in the generation of a code signal, preferably from the computer memory, which is recorded in a temporary storage device such as on a magnetic disc or in an electronic memory, and the reproduction of such code signals from such storage device each time an entry is made by the operator into the computer or data is received from the computer or together with the information so recorded td or a code signal or signals representative of the memory derived from the computer.The enabling signal or control which permits data to be received or entered may be periodically updated or refreshed in accordance with periodic checks of the identification of the person entering the data which may be randomly or periodically indicated by a warning device requiring same or a sensing device which senses when such person leaves the vicinity of the terminal at which data is entered or requested. In another form of the invention, data may be entered or requested by. a . person speaking words ifflo a microphone at the computer terminal or remote therefrom and connected to the computer terminal by short wave or telephone lines, wherein the voice signals of the person entering or requesting the data are automatically analyzed by the computer for identifying such person and generating an enabling signal as well as the identification code signal which is recorded along with signals indicative of the information derived from and or entered into the computer.Such automatic analysis may occur as the person speaks words indicative of information requested or to be answered. In a particular form of the invention, two or more of the aforedescribed personal identification techniques may be employed and required for the entry or attainment of data or of specific data in the computer. Accordingly, it is a primary object of this invention to provide a new and improved system and method for operating a computer or computing system. Another object is to provide system and method for operating a computer or computing system wherein identification of persons having access thereto and entering or receiving data with respect to the computer or its memory, is ascertained. Another object is to provide a computer or computing system in which persons entering data into the system are identified and all transactions, including data entered and received, are identified and recorded as to the identifncaXion of the person partaking in such transactions. Another object is to provide a computing system in which fraud in the entry of data is greatly reduced. Another object is to provide a comnuter system in Which confidential data stored in or retrieved from a computer, is not available to any but authorized persons. Another object is to provide a computer system which data is both entered and retrieved from the computer or its memory by the automatic analysis of speech signals gewe ated by a person speaking into a microphone which analysis results in identification of such person and the generation of a code which is applied as a recording to indicat the informa tion derived from and entered into the computer, or record keeping purposes. Another object is to provide a computer security system in which the presence of a person is sensed at a terminal and the person is identified by sensing a physical characteristic of such person or by the person entering a code into the com uter or auxiliary equipment wherein, if such person should leave the vicinity of the terminal, another person will not be able to operate the computer without further identification of sIch other person. Another object is to provide a computer security system in which a record is made of the identity of all persons operazing the computer and the information entered and received from the computer, whereby the source of data entered into the computer and retrieved therefrom may be identified for auditing purposes and control. Another object is to provide a computer security system in which signals are recorded which positively identify persons who operate a computer or peripheral together with an indication of time of operation of the computer and information transferred. With the above and such other objects in view as may hereinafter more fully appear, the invention consists of the novel constructions, combinations and arrangements of parts and method as will be more fully descr ibed and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, but it is to be understood that changes, variations and modifications may be resorted to which fall within the scope of the invention as claimed. In the drawings FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing features of the broad computer security and control system defining the instant invention and FIG. 2 is a more detailed schematic diagram of the computer security system defining the instant invention. in Tn FIGe 1 is shown broad aspects of a data terminal ilA forming part of a data processing system 10 which includes a computer 50 and one or more of such terminals which may time share the computer 50 t cugh interface 49 such as a time sharing multiplexing system. The terminal 11A includes a coded keyboard 12 having an output 12A extending to a control gate or switch 1t, which itself contains an output i4A extending to the interface or multiplexing device 49.The latter interface 49 contains ore or more outputs 49A extending to the input or inputs of the com puter 50 while the computer 50 contains one or more outputs 4C3 extending to the interface 49 which itself contains a plurality of outputs one of which 14B extends to the gate 14 and an outt t 14C from such gate extends to the input 13A of a memory or buffer 13B for an image writing display 13 which may co nprse a conventional display cathode ray tube.Unless gate 14 which may contain one or more switches for enabling information to be transmitted from the coded keyboard 12 to the interface 49 and a computer 50 and from the computer 50 to the memory or buffer 13B for the cathode ray tube 13.is closed such functions relating to the computer 50 as data input thereto, data retrieved there ro and programming of the computer may not be performed. In order to enable the operation of the computer 50 from the terminal 11A, an operator sitting at the coded keyboard 12 must properly activate one or more sensors, at least one of which is a sensor of a physical characteristic of the operator s ch as a microphone or other device.In PIG. 1, a microphone 15A is provided at the terminal, preferably although not necessarily, attached to the frame supporting the coded keyboard 12 and the cathode ray tube display 13 and at a location such that a person sitting at such keyboard may speak selected words into the micro phone 90 that analog audio signals wn be generated on the output thereof which extends to a computer or speech recog flition processor 16 of conventional design. The speech recognition processor computer 16 is operable to process or digitize the analog speech signals generated on the output of the microphone 15A and automatically analyze same by comparing the results with signals generated from a memory in the processor. MMen the signals so analyzed match or otherwise com pare with signals reproduced from the memory of the processor, which memory contains recordings or speech information from one or more persons authorized to operate the computer 50, a first signal is generated on one of a plurality of outputs 16A of the processor 16 and is applied to a particular circuit of a multiple input storage device 19 containing codes associated with different persons authorized to use the computer 50.Depending upon which of the outputs 16A of the processor 16 is activated, one of the codes stored in the storage device 19 is generated on its output 19A and is passed to the input 14D of the gate 14. When gate 14 is properly operated and closed, such code is passed to the computer 50 through the interface 49 and is recorded in the memory of the computer together with an indication of the time and date of such recording, as generated by either an internal clock associated with the computer circuits or an external clock connecQed ro the computer.An indication of the information transmitted to the computer 50 from the coded keyboard 12 and received from the computer and displayed on the display screen of a cathode ray tube 13, is recorded in a special section of the memory of the computer 50 or an auxiliary memory located within or external of the computer so that an identification of the person operatingiiecomputer, the information such person enters into the computer and the. information received from the computer as well as the date and time of day such information is generated or received, is had for future reference. Gate 14, which is normally open and thereby prevents the transmission of information to or from the computer with respect to the terminal 11A, will close to pass information both directiors when the speech recognition processor corputer 16 recognizes the speech signals received as those generated by a person authorized to use the computer and generates, in addition to signal on one of the outputs 16A for generating the described code identifying the person, a control signal on another output 163 which activates a bi stabre switch or relay 16C, the output of which energizes one input of a logical AND circuit 17 which is maintained energized either for the duration of the time the computer is used by the person at the terminal or until a sensor at the terminal senses the movement of such person away from the terminal. Such sensor, denoted 15S in FIG. 1, may comprise a limit switch supported within the seat or cushion of the terminal, the output 15SA of which extends to the other input of the AND circuit 17, thereby generating an output signal on the output 17A of the AND circuit 17, which output extends to the switching input 14E of the gate i4.When so energized, gate 14 closes thereby allowing information thereafter to be passed from the coded keyboard 12 to the computer and also allowing the code generated on the output of the code generator 19, which is temp orarily delayed in a delay element or relay 19D, to be passed to the computer. Also, when gate 14 is closed as described, information generated by the computer from its memory or from calcu lations performed thereby, may pass through such gate to the in put 13A of the buffer 133 for the cathode ray tube display 13 and to be thereby generated as a still image of lines of alpha numer ic characters or other information generated by the computer 50. Should the person sitting at the terminal 11A leave the vicinity of the terminal, the presence sensor 155 becomes deactiv4 ated causing the output of the AND circuit 17 to be terminated, and a control such as a logical NOT circuit or other cont2cts of the presence sensor switch to become closed or activated so as to signal the microprocessor or computer 16 or directly an input 14F of the switch contro2, the switch or gate 14 to open so What, should another person try to operate the terminal, such operation will not be possible until such other person is identified and properly positioned at the terminal as described. Identification of the person seeking to use the comuut er 50 may be effected in a number of manners as described and also be such person selectively operating switches of the keyboard 12 to generate a selected code or codes kndwn only to such person or a limited number of persons, which code or codes may be directly applied to close gate 14 or may be utilized to operate an auxilliary control means such as a coded relay or circuit for generating a signal on an input to the AND circuit 17 or other logical circuit receiving a signal, for example, from a presence sensor such as sensor 15S.If the gate 14 is a bistable switch, it may be automatically caused to open vihen it receives a signal generated, for example, when the person operating the terminal, leaves the terminal as sensed by sensor Iss. Memory 19 may also comprise an EPROM erasible nregram mable read only memory forming part of the speech signal recognition computer 16 and operable to generate a code identifying the person whose speech signals are recognized by such computer which code signal may be passed therefrom either directly to the computer 50 for recording therein along with signals indicative of the information entered into the computer 50 by the selectee operation of the keyboard or other means and of any information derived from the computer 50 or such identifying code may be stored in an auxiliary memory such as another EPROM to be read therefrom whenever the keyboard 12 is operated thereafter and or whenever queried by signals from the RTI ID 11.14 commuter which may be programmed to identify sensitive information. FIG. 2 shows greater details of a system 10A which is a modified form of system 10 of lIG. 1 and is operable for assuring computer operating security. Whereas in TS, 1 a number of subsystems and discreet components are employed to enable the transmission of information to a computer and the reception and display of information generated by the computer, in FIG. 2 a microprocessor or microcomputer 20 is employed, which is pro granted to control the transmission of data to and from plurality of data storage and analyzing devices, the combination of which are operable to assure computer data security. by identifying the person attempting to operate the terminal and input data into a local or remote computer which may be. time shared with other terminals and receive data from such remote computer Means are also provided for generating z code assoc iated with the person so identified and recording such code either locally in a memory or within the memory of the computer along with information identifying the data transmitted to the com is puter and received from the computer so that if it necessary to indicate who of the persons authorized to operate the terminal entered specific data in the computer memory and received spec ific data therefrom, such function may be performed at one or more terminals of the system or at a central terminal or monitor station which may be located near the computer. The computer 50 may comprise a data processing computer, image or document information storage and retrieval coirputer, scientific information storage and retrieval computer or any type of computer which is operable to receive and or disseminate information of a sensitive nature. One or more input and output lines 50A and SOB extend to the computer for the transmission of data thereto from one or more terminals and the reception of data stored in the memory of the computer or generated by its computing circuits. A monitor station SOM is provided having a television display, such as a cathode ray tube 50D which is driven and the display thereof maintained by a buffer 50C which includes a decoder driver and refresh memory.A manually oper able keyboard 50K is also provided at the monitor station or two way communication with the computer and, although not illus trated, control means of the type which will be described to assure computer security at the terminals which communicate with the computer 50,may also be provided at the monitor station SOM. An alarm 50E located at. the monitor station 50M, which may be part of or attached to the video display SOD or keyboard 50K, is operable to alert a person at the monitor station of certain conditions which may exist at one or more of the termin als which are operable to communicate with the computer 50, enter data therein and. receive data therefrom.Such a remote condition as an aborted attempt to communicate with the computer, a number of such attempts, the presence of a person at any of the terminal or the removal of such persons from a terminal, may be initially indicated by operation of the alarm 50E when its driver 50F ns activated by a signal from the computer 50 and further details thereof may be derived by information transmitted from the computer 50 to the display 5GD. From multiple terminal operation, an input output inter face 49, as described, connects the circuits 50A and SOB to computer 50 directly with an output 14F of control microprocessor or computer 20 and an output 49A thereof to a transmission gate 14G the output of which extends to microprocessor .26. Microprocessor 20 is clocked by signals from an oscillator 22 having an attend ant. feedback circuit 22E for stability. The microprocessor 20 receives signals from a plurality of inputs including a3 a manual keyboard 12 with which the operator of the terminal may enter data into the computer 20 and by means of which the operator may receive data therefrom, such as data stored in the memory of the computer, an aunliary memory con trolled by the computer or data defining the results of computa tions performed by the computer. To verify that the person sitting at the terminal is authorized to enter data into the computer and to receive data from the computer and permit such entry and retrieval and, further, to record such transactions and operations including the identifi cation of the person at the computer terminal whois communicat ing with the computer and the date of such communications, the following input and output devices are employed per se or in combination Lb3 A microphone 23 is disposed convenient to the crer ator of the keyboard 12, such as integral therewith or adjacent thereto.To identify the operator, selected words are spoken by the operator into the microphone 23 and are amplified by an amplifier 23A, the output of which extends to an automatic voice print analyzing circuit 24 and a speech recognition computer 27, both of which have respective variable input devices such as pluggable memories 25 and 28 which are preferably locked and secured in a hou ing, such as the terminal housing, and ay be changed with the changing of personnel who are authorized to use the computer at the terminal 11A.An interface 26 receives the signal output of the analyzing circuit 24 and a second enters face 29 receives the signals output from the speech processor 27, inputing such signals to the microprocessor 20 on respective cssr cuits, for use thereby in comparing such outputs with signals derived from the voice print memory 25 and the speech pattern memory 28.The computer and microprocessor 20 automatically determine if the person at the terminal, who is speaking the selected words into the microphone, is actually a person author ized to use the computer 50 from the analysis which includes signals transmitted by the microprocessor to a code comparator 30.Upon positive identification of such person at the,t rminal by the analysis of the signals output by the microprocessor 20, a switching signal is generated and transmitted from the microprocessor to the transmission gate 14G which is controlled thereby to close and thereby permit the transmission of signals output by the interface from the computer 50 to the microprocessor, when received, which signals may be used to activate respective drives 31, 33, 35 and 37 for a plurality of circuits. Drive 31 is operable for controlling display functions of a video display 13, which may be a cathode ray tube of the type described, adjacent or attached to a keyboard 12.
