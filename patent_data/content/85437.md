# Monitor for transmission line.

## Abstract
In a network system at least one data communication unit and a transmission line monitoring device are interconnected by a common transmission line. In order to detect transmission faults the monitoring device comprises means for exchanging data with a specific data transmission unit via the common transmission line and means for receiving status information fed from the data transmission unit. A storage means stores the status information fed from the data transmission unit and a comparator means compares the status information of the data transmission unit stored in the storage means with new status information returned from the data transmission unit. The new status information is displayed on a display means in response to the result of comparison at the comparator means. The new status information is then written into the storage means.
