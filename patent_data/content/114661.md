# MOLECULAR SIEVE OXYGEN MONITOR

## Abstract
A monitoring system for determining the concentration of oxygen in the product gas of an oxygen enriching system includes differential pressure regulator 12 means for reduc ing the pressure of the product gas, for regulating the pressure of the product gas at a preset level, and for referencing the regulated pressure to atmospheric pressure. Solenoid valves 14, 22 allowing product gas to pressurize the monitoring system in a first condition and to allow product gas to vent the monitoring system to the atmos phere in a second condition are also included. Restrictive orifices 16, 20 upstream and downstream of a bed of molecular sieve material eliminate pressure spikes in the monitoring system. A bed of molecular sieve material 18 adsorbs oxygen from the product gas wherein, in a first condition, with the system pressurized, the upper pressure limit is attenuated as the molecular sieve bed adsorbs oxgyen from the product gas, and, in a second condition, with the system vented to the atmosphere, the lower pressure limit is attenuated by the rate of desorption of the oxygen from the molecular sieve bed. A pressure transducer 26 means for converting the system presure to an electrical analog of that pressure and compares the electrical analog to a reference so that oxygen concentration can be inferred.
