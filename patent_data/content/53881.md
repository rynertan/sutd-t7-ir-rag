# Mass transfer apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for effecting mass transfer between two fluid phases, at least the first of which is a liquid, which apparatus comprises an annular permeable element which is rotatable about its axis of symmetry, means to charge the first fluid to the permeable element, means to charge the second fluid to the permeable element, and means to discharge at least one of the fluids or a derivative thereof from the permeable element characterised in that the permeable element is formed by winding a tape under tension around the said axis and anchoring the tape to maintain it under tension.
