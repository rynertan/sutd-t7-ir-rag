# Flood level sensor for fluid filling systems.

## Abstract
An improved flood level sensor has an upstanding, vented tube 44 extending above and outside a receptacle 10 while maintaining fluid communication with an enclosed rim 23 of the receptacle. A partial vacuum is communicated to an orifice which is located within the tube 44 at a height related to a limit on the level of fluid in the receptacle 10 . The level of fluid in the tube 44 depends upon the fluid pressure in the enclosed rim 23 and therefore upon the fluid level in the receptacle 10 . When the fluid level in the receptacle 10 is below flood level, the orifice is able to relieve any partial vacuum communicated to it. However, when the level of fluid in the receptacle 10 rises to the flood level, the fluid level in the tube 1, 4 rises to partially seal the orifice and prevent relief of the partial vacuum which then actuates a valve lockout device 14 .
