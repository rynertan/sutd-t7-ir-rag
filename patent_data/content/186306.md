# CROSSLINKABLE COMPOSITION COMPRISING AMINOEPOXY RESIN

## Abstract
A self crosslinkable resin and a composition of matter comprising same are provided, which resin comprises certain diene functional blocked dieneophile functional ami noepoxy resin, which resin is self crosslinkable at elevated cure temperature. The diene functional blocked dieneophile functional aminoepoxy resin comprises the reaction product of diepoxide with amine functional diene chain extending reactant, amine functional blocked dieneophile chain extend ing reactant, optionally, monofunctional end capping reac tant such as mono secondary amine functional diene and mono secondary amine functional blocked dieneophile, and modifying agent comprising hydroxy functional secondary amine. Compositions comprising the aforesaid self crosslinkable resin may further comprise crosslinking agent reactive with hydroxy functionality of the resin. The cros slinkable composition of matter is useful in coatings and other applications, especially solvent based primer coating compositions and cathodic electrocoating compositions.
