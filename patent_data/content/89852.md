# Electrical generators of the fuel cell type.

## Abstract
A high temperature solid oxide electrolyte type fuel cell generator with an electrical connection of the fuel cell electrodes to the electrical output bus, which is brought through the generator housing to be connected to an electrical load line, maintains a highly uniform temperature distribution. The electrical connection includes an electrode bus which is spaced parallel to the output bus with a plurality of symmetrically spaced transversely extending conductors extending between the electrode bus and the output bus, with thermal insulation provided about the transverse con ductors between the spaced apart buses. Single or plural stages of the insulated transversely extending conductors can be provided within the high temperature regions of the fuel cell generator to provide highly homogeneous tempera ture distribution over the contacting surfaces.
