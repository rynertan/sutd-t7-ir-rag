# Facsimile apparatus with multiple scanning and printing elements.

## Abstract
A drum type transceiver facsimile machine having a plurality of light to electric transducers 27 30 and a plurality of printing styli 41 44 moved axially of the drum 10 for scan print operation. Shift register means 61 64 and a buffer memory 56 controlled by a programmed microprocessor 58, 65 provide for multiplexing of signals from the transducers having a scan operation and demultiplexing of signals during the print mode with use of a buffer memory permitting comprestion of the multiplexed signals and decompression of received signals prior to demultiplexing.
