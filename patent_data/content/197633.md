# Method for the production of m aminophenol.

## Abstract
A method for the production of m aminophenol com prises non catalytically reacting resorcinol and ammonia at a temperature between 180 and 300 C and at a pressure of from 25 to 80 kg cmÂ² gauge in the presence of water. The pressure can be maintained by supply of inert gas. The product can be isolated by distillation. The elevated pressure gives good conversion of the resorcinol and selectivity for the product m aminophenol without substantially increasing the molar ratio of ammonia to resorcinol.

## Description
PRODUCTION OF.m AMINOPHENOL FROM RESORCINOL The present invention relates to a method for non catalytic production of m aminophenol which is industrially very important not only as an intermediate for the preparation of medicines, agricultural chemicals, azo dyes, antioxidants, and photographic developers but also as a starting material for the manufacture of polyimide or polyamide.baed heat resistant resins. Hitherto, m aminophenol was produced by melting metanilic acid together with caustic soda, hydroxylating m phenylenediamine, or reacting resorcinol and ammonia in an aqueous medium in the presence of a catalyst. As the catalyst, there were used phosphoric acid or ammonium phosphate Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 121728 1978 copper halides, nickel halides, or cobalt halides Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 42829 1977 phosphoric acid salts of antimony, vanadium, or iron Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 4338 1980 and molybdenum compounds Japanese PatentApplication OPI No. 108841 1980 . The term OPI as used herein refers to a published unexamined Japanese patent application . Whichever type of catalyst is used, the reaction be carried out in an aqueous medium in the presence of a large amount up to the stoichiometric amount of the catalyst. Therefore, the product maminophenol was isolated by precipitation upon cooling the aqueous solution which had been adjusted neutral, extraction from an aqueous phase, or by distillation.However, in these methods, substantial amounts of salts were precipitated, leading to heavy loads for waste liquor treatment. This problem was also encountered in the partial hydroxylation of m phenylenediamine and the melting of metanilic acid together with caustic soda. As methods for eliminating this problem,Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 28429 1973 proposed a method in which the reaction of resorcinol and ammonia is carried out by introducing ammonia gas into molten resorcinol at atmospheric pressure in the absence of both a catalyst and a solvent. This proposed method is a noncatalytic method, which is free from the problem involved in the above described catalytic methods. However, this non catalytic method had a problem that the reaction rate is low, i.e., since ammonia gas is introduced at atmospheric pressure, nonetheless ammonia is introduced in an amount of from 3 to 10 molar times that of resorcinol5 the conversion of resorcinol is at most about 25 to 55 . In addition, the selectivity for m aminophenol is not always high as about from 85 to 77 with respect to resorcinol. We have sought a non catalytic method which is free from the above described problems, and have found that when the reaction components are reacted under elevated pressure in the presence of water, both the conversion of resorcinol and the selectivity for m aminophenol can be increased without substantially increasing the molar ratio of ammonia to resorcinol. The present invention thus provides a method for the production of m aminophenol, comprising noncatalytically reacting resorcinol and ammonia at a temperature between 180 and 300 C and at a pressure of from 25 to 80 kg cm gauge in the presence of water. If the pressure of the reaction system is less than 25 kg cmw gauge , no appropriate reaction rate is attained, and low selectivity for m amihophenol will result. On the other hand, if the reaction is carried out at a pressure exceeding 80 kg cm2 gauge , the results are no better than when the reaction is performed in the pressure range of from 25 to 80 kg cm2 gauge , and no significant advantage is attained by increasing the pressure to higher than 80 kg cm2 gauge . The pressure range for the reaction system, i.e., from 25 to 80 kg cm2 gauge , can be maintained either by controlling the reaction temperature to be within the range of from 180 to 3000C, or by adjusting the concentration of ammonia in an aqueous solution with the molar ratio of ammonia to resorcinol being held at 1.0 1 or more. If desired, the pressure of the reaction system can be maintained by supplying a gas which is inert to the reaction, such as nitrogen, argon, or helium, Subsequent to completion of the reaction, the product m aminophenol can be isolated by distillation the unreacted resorcinol and the product m aminophenol are eluted together and can be separated from 3,3 dihydroxydiphenylamine which is a condensate of resorcinol and m aminophenol and other condensation products. The separation of the eluted resorcinol and maminophenol can be carried out by recrystallization from water or by liquid liquid extraction with a water ether solvent system.
