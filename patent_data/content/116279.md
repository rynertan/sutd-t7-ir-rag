## Description
SEAT SUPPORT DEVICE, AND A METHOD FOR MOUNTING THESEAT FITTED WITH SAID DEVICE ON TO A VEHICLEThis invention relates to a seat support device, in particular for a motor vehicle seat, and a method for mounting a seat fitted with said device, and in particular a front seat, on to a vehicle body.Seat support devices, in particular for motor vehicles, comprise a pair of guides rigid with the seat support structure, and a pair of rails formed in one piece with and or fixed rigidly to the floor of the vehicle body The rails are arranged to slidably house the guides in order to connect the seat to the floor while at the same time allowing it to be moved along the floor parallel to the guides to enable the vehicle user to position the seat accord ing to his own requirements. The described devices have the drawback of not allowing automatic mounting of the seat on the body in the current state of the art, in that the necessary movements are too complicated. Moreover, if faults develop, the replacement and or repair of the slide rails can create problems, in that they are usually welded to the vehicle floor.The object of the present invention is to provide a seat support device, in particular for motor vehicles, of the type described heretofore but free from the aforesaid drawbacks. In particular, a support device is to be provided able to allow automatic mounting of the seat on a vehicle body by simple movements, and comprising rails which can be easily removed from the vehicle floor while at the same time able to securely constrain the seat to said floor.Said object is attained according to the present invention by a seat support device, in particular for a motor vehicle seat, of the type comprising at least one guide mounted below and rigid with said seat, and at least one rail provided with means for its fixing to a floor, said guide being parallel to said rail and being slidably housed in this latter in order to connect said seat to said floor while at the same time allowing said seat to move parallel to said floor along a predetermined direction parallel to said rail, characterised in that said fixing means comprise at least one rigid appendix fixed rigidly to said rail and perpendicular thereto, at least one housing carried rigidly by said floor and arranged to engage said appendix, this latter being configured for insertion into said housing, and at least one demountable convection element for connecting said rail to said floor.The present invention also relates to a method for mounting a seat, particularly a front seat, on to a vehicle body, said seat comprising a support structure provided with at least one guide arranged to slide in a respective rail parallel thereto, said rail being arranged for rigid fixing to the floor of said body, characterised by comprising, in chronological succession a first stage in which said guide is mounted in said rail, which is provided with means for preventing said guide from withdrawing laterally or upwards, so as to constrain said seat to said rail a second stage in which said seat, provided with said rail, is introduced into said body, said rail being disposed in a position corresponding with brackets rigid with said floor of said body a third stage in which at least one lateral appendix of said rail, fixed rigidly thereto, is introduced into a respective housing provided in one of said brackets so that said appendix becomes removably insertion fitted into said housing and a fourth stage in which said rail is fixed to another of said brackets by means of at least one demountable connection element in such a manner as to prevent said appendix emerging from said seat, this latter and said appendix being arranged to mutually cooperate in order to keep said seat constrain ed to said body.The present invention will be more apparent from the non limiting description given hereinafter of one embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, on which Figure 1 is a side view of a seat provided with a support device constructed in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a section on the line Il Il through the seat of Figure 1 Figure 3 and 4 are two different details of the seat of Figures 1 and 2 to an enlarged scale Figure 5 is a section on the line V V through the detail of Figure 4 Figure 6 illustrates one stage of the method for mounting the seat of Figures 1 and 2.In Figures 1 and 2, the reference numeral 1 indicates overall a seat, in particular a motor vehicle front seat, comprising a seat portion 2 and a back portion 3 which are supported by a rear structure 4 fitted with a pair of parallel straight guides 5 disposed below the seat portion 2 on apposite sides, 6 and 7 respectively, of the seat 1. The guides 5 are rigidly fixed to the support structure 4, and in a preferred embodiment are of plastics construction, for example directly moulded on to the structure 4. The seat 1 is fixed by the guides 5 to a substantially flat floor 8 which in the example illustrated forms part of the body 9 of a vehicle, not shown.The floor 8 is provided with two pairs of support brackets, namely inner brackets 10 disposed in proximity to a central raised portion 11 of the floor 8 of the body 9, and outer brackets 12 disposed in proximity to that lower outer edge 13 of the body 9 which lowerly defines the space, not shown, which is designed to receive the vehicle doors. The brackets 10, front and rear respectively, are constructed of bent plate welded to the floor 8, and each has and upper support surface 14 and a substantially parallelepiped housing 15 of predetermined depth.The brackets 12, front and rear respectively, face the corresponding brackets 10 and are also constructed of bent plate welded to the floor 8, and comprise an upper support surface 16 parallel to the surface 14. An inner straight rail 18 and an outer straight rail 19 are disposed parallel to each other on the surfaces 14 and 16 of the pairs of brackets 10 and 12 respectively, and are arranged to slidably house the guides 5, which are parallel to them. The rail 18 is specular and symmetrical to the rail 12, which is shown to an enlarged scale in crosssect i on inFigure 3, the rail 18 being shown to an enlarged scale in Figures 4 e 5.With reference to Figures 3, 4 and 5, the rails 18 and 19 are of metal plate construction, are straight, and have a channel configuration. They are provided with facing side edges 20 and with upper edges 21 which are bent towards each other and arranged to cooperate with the guides 5 in order to prevent these latter from withdrawing laterally or upwardly from the rails 18 and 19, into which the guides 5 are inserted by sliding them parallel to their axis starting from one or other of the two ends 22 of the rails 18 and 19. These latter, by cooperating with the guides 5, are therefore able to constrain the seat 1 to the floor 8, while at the same time allowing said seat 1 to move parallel to the floor 8 in a predetermined direction parallel to the rails 18 and 19.The rails 18 and 19 are removably and substantially rigidly fixed to the floor 8 by the brackets 10 and 12 and suitable disengageable fixing means comprising at least one rigid appendix 23 fixed rigidly to one of the rails 18 or 19 and arranged to cooperate with the seat 15, and at least one demountable connection element 24 for example a bolt, a screw, a pressure clip etc. arranged to connect the other of the rails 18 or 19 to the floor 8 and or the bra ckets 10 and 12. Specifically, in the i Iillustrated example the rail 18 is provided with two parallel lateral appendices 23 perpendicular to the rail 18 and facing the central raised portion 11, and pro vided with lower support surfaces 25 arranged to cooperate with the surfaces 14 of the brackets 10, in correspondence with which the appendices 23 are disposed. The appendices 23 are welded to the rail 18, are constructed of U bent plate, ae of substantially parallelepiped shape and are arranged to fit by insertion into the corresponding housings 15 provided in the pair of brackets 10, on which the appendices 23 are arranged to rest. Finally, each appendix 23 comprises at least one oblique surface 26, which in the illustrated example is defined by bent edges 27 of said appendix 23, and which is arranged for insertion wedging into the respective housing 15, as too lock the relative appendix 23 in this latter substantially without slack.In contrast, the rail 19 is provided with two brackets 28 in positions corresponding with the pair of brackets 12 laterally and perpendicularly to the rail 19 on that side thereof opposite to the side facing the appendices 23, and are arranged to rest on the surfaces 16 of the brackets 12. These latter are provided with through holes 29, corresponding with which there are provided respective slots 30 in the brackets 28. These slots and the holes 29 are arranged to house a bolt 31 which together with a nut 32 constitutes the connection element 24, which is arranged to engage both the corresponding brackets 12 and 28 in order to rigidly and demountably connect the rail 19 to the brackets 12, and consequently lock the appendices 23 in the housings 15.The aforesaid fixing system allows easy mounting and removal of the seat 1, and the replacement of the rails 18 and or 19 in case of faults or breakage, and is of simple and economical construction and assembly. Finally, it enables the seat to be mounted on the vehicle body by an entirely new method, which can be easily and economically automated in each of its stages. This method is as follows.The seat 1, completed on an upholstery line and fitt ed with the guides 5, is firstly moved into a suitable station in which the rails 18 and 19 are mounted on it. This mounting operation is carried out by positioning the rails 18 and 19 coaxially to each respective guide 5, and then sliding by translatory movement of the seat I and or of the rails 18 and 19 these latter into the rails 18 and 19 by way of one of the ends 22 of each of them. In this manner, as translatory movement is the only movement permitted to the guides 5 in the rails 18 and 19, these latter form a single preassembled unit with the seat 1 after the mounting operation.The seatI is obviously fitted with a known device, not shown for simplicity, which can arrest the translatory movement of the guides 5 in the rails 18 and 19 in a plurality of different positions, and which can be operated by the user of the seat 1. The described mounting operation can be carried out either manually, or automatically by fitting said station with suitable positioning locators for the seat 1 and the guides 18 and 19, with automatic feed units, and with an automatic pusher for effecting the translatory movement parallel to the guides 5 which is necessary for the mounting operation. The guides 18 and 19 obviously reach said station already fitted with the appendices 23 and brackets 28, which have been previously fixed to them.The unit formed in this manner is then moved on to an assembly line or station, for example an automatic one, which is provided with reference locators and to which bodies 9 are fed. One and or more seats 1 are introduced into the body 9 in this station, for example through the door spare, and are then positioned on the brackets 10 and 12, which have been previously fixed and welded to the floor 8 of the body 9 during the assembly of this later on the bodywork line. In the case of a front seat 1, during this stage of the mounting operations the seat 1 is presented to the interior of the body 9 in the manner illustrated in Figure 6, ie with the appendices 23 facing the respective housings 15 of the brackets 10, and the brackets 28 completely resting on the brackets 12 in proximity to the edge 13.In the next operation, the seat 1 thus positioned is moved manually and or by suitable pushers for example those which introduced it into the body 9 perpendicular to the guides 5, so that the appendices 23 become inserted into the housings 15 and the guide 18 is moved completely on to the surface 14. Consequently, by virtue of the surfaces 26, the appendices 23 become insert ion fitted in a removable manner by reversing the direction of movement into the housings 15, while simultaneously the brackets 28 slide on the support surface 16 until they assume a position in which the slots 30 correspond with the respective holes 29 in the brackets 12.In the final operation, a bolt 31 is inserted through each hole 29 and the respective slot 30, and is fixed to the bracket 12 by means of a nut 32, ma nually and or using an automatic tightener the nut 32 can obviously be dismsd with if the hole 29 istle ed .The bolts3 fix the brackets 28 on to the brackets 12 to prevent further translatory movement perpendicular to the guides 5, and thus prevent the appendices 23 from emerging from the housings 15, while at the same time fixing the rail 19 to the brackets 12.The purpose of the appendices 23 during operation is to absorb a l the main stresses for example due to acceleration, braking, sliding of the seat 1 etc. while cooperating with the housings 15 in order to keep the seat 1 constrained to the body 9, whereas the only purpose of the bolts 31 is to prevent transverse movements of the guides 18 and 19 on the brackets 10 and 12 in order to maintain the appendices 23 in strict cooperation with the housings 15. The presence of the slot 30 enables any small constructional inaccuracies to be compesanted during the mounting operation by adjusting the seat 1 perpendicular to the guides 5 by small movements before the nut and bolt element 24 is fully tightened. From the description it is apparent that modifications can be made to the described device and method without leaving the scope of the present invention.Said device and method can obviously also be applied to a rear bench type seat, which can be introduced through the rear doors or, using only one extra movement, through the front door spaces.
