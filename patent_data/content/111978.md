# SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE DEVICE

## Abstract
A surface acoustic wave device includes apodised interdigital electrode arrays 2,3, coupled by a multistrip coupler 5. In a design in which the apodisation 8 comprises a main lobe flanked by a succession of minor lobes, the effects of diffraction relating to short electrode pair overlaps, are reduced by dividing at least the far end of the array into two or more series connected array portions 21, 22. Difficulties arising from unbalanced electrode edge overlaps at transitions 20 between different members of electrode pairs connected in series, are reduced by locating such transitions in the region of nulls in the apodisation pattern.
