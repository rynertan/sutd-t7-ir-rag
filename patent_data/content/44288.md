# Apparatus for regulating radiation through windows.

## Abstract
A method of insulating windows, glass walls and glazed doors, whereby a porous insulating material such as small bodies or particles is caused to fill the major portion of the slot shaped space between two transparent media where they are held between two sheets 9, 10 or limiting layers, which can be folded at least horizontally and which, when pulled up out of the gap, transfer the insulating material to a magazine 1 in the upper portion of the construction.
