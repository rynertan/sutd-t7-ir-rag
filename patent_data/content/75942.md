# Memory circuit.

## Abstract
A memory circuit capable of detecting that refresh operation is surely ended is disclosed. The memory circuit comprises a memory cell matrix, a dummy array sharing rows with the memory cell matrix and similar column structure to the memory cell matrix, and means coupled to a pair of digit lines of the dummy array for detecting that a potential at either of the pair of digit lines in the dummy array reaches an amplified low level.
