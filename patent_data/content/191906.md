# Apparatus for monitoring the presence of a person in a bed.

## Abstract
Apparatus for monitoring the presence of a person in a bed comprises a switching device 10 and a monitoring device 110 . The switching device 10 comprises a flexible base member 12 having an aperture 22 therethrough, sandwiched between two conductive members 28, 34 and covered with two cover members 36, 40 . When a patient lies on the switching device, the base member is deformed allowing the two conductive members to close the circuit. The monitoring device 110 comprises a binary signal generator 112 , a time delay 124 which produces a signal when the signal generator has been operated for a predeter mined time, a latching device 130 , an alarm signal gener ator 142 and an alarm control device 132 for varying the nature of the alarm signal produced by the generator.
