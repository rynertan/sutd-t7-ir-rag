# Method for manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit includes diffusing an impurity of a second conductiv ity type into polycrystalline silicon layers 10 formed on a first conductivity region 5 in a substrate 1 to form second conductivity regions 13 , the polycrystalline silicon layers 10 constituting first electrode wirings to the second conduc tivity regions 13 forming a thick oxidation film 11 on the polycrystalline silicon layers 10 and a thin oxidation film 12 on the exposed surface of the substrate by a heat oxida tion treatment and removing the thin oxidation film 12 to form a second electrode wiring to the first conductivity reg ion 5 , said second electrode wiring being insulated from the polycrystalline silicon layers 10 by the thick oxidation film 11 . The method provides integrated circuits such as IÂ²L cir cuits which are capable of high speed operation and a high packaging density.
