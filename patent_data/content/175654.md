# Procedure for the manufacturing of double layer resistive thin film integrated resistors through ion erosion.

## Abstract
Procedure for the manufacturing of thin film resistors having differing surface resistivities such as to bring to defi nition in one sole ion erosion phase both the resistive ele ments having differing surface resistivity and the conductive structures. Said procedure is based upon sequential film deposi tion in decreasing surface resistivity order and then of the conductive film, constructing at each deposition, protective masks over the relevant resistor or conductor areas defined by means of normal photolithographic techniques and therefore proceding with ion attack on the unmasked areas.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Procedure for thin film integrated resistors and conductive elements characterized by having two or more different surface resistivities. 2. Procedure for the manufacturing of integrated resistors as under claim 1 characterized by being defined by one single ion erosion phase. 3. Procedure, along the lines of the description above and illustrated in the figure enclosed, as well as any part of it in isolation or in combination.

## Description
PROCEDURE FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF DOUBLE LAYER RESESTIVE THEN FILM INTEGRATED RESISTORS THROUGH ION EROSION The present invention takes regard for a procedure for the ma nufacturing by ion erosion of thin film integrated resistors having two or more resistive layers.It belongs to the microelectronics field, in general, and may find profitable application, in particular in the field of components applicable to hybrid circuits H,C. and microwave ntegrated circuits M.I.C. .In existing techniques, microcircui ts containing thin film esi store have never ti 11 now been manufactl√¨red 5 th two or sore differing materials which have differing surface resistivities because although there is the technical possibility of manufacturing them using traditional methods, the productive cycle would be complex and costly.Therefore as there are no techniques in li terature using double resistive layer save the case of monolythic integrated circuits , the advantage of the present solution may be evaluated by compension with those single resistive film techniques which must undergo three limitations, to cover a large range of values especially in the case of high resistive values for low surface resistivities and of low values in the apposite case manufacturing of very narrow resistive paths 10 20 um with obvious implementation problems, inaccuracies, high rejects and difficult trimming engagement of large surfaces for the meander lines impossibility of implementing both high and low resistor values.The invention will now be described making reference to one of its presently preferred forms, which is herein annexed but not limited to as on illustrative example, and with reference toFIGURE 1, which represents a manufacturing cycle, as on example of the process for an integrated circuit on an alumina substrate with CERMET and NiCr resistors and conductive pathis inNi CrPT Aj. Therefore for the manufacturing of a microcircuit which has highandlow value resistors manufactured during the same attack cycle, the process , with reference to Figure 1 is as follows aj Cermet film deposition through RF sputtering b Cermet photomasking through photopolymer A2i350H c Electrolytic growth o the ask Wi, 2 im thick and photopolymer removal d Ni Cr film deposition through RF spattering e Ni Cr phomasking f electrolytic growth of the mask 5, 2 thick and then photopolymer removal g antidiffusive conduct e triple layer Ni C1 Pt Aui deposition h photomasking of the conductive layer i electrolytic growth of the mask Ni, about 3 m thick and photopolymer removal 1 ion attack of the unmasked areas m removal of the residual masks.The presente invention makes possible, through this procedure, to obtain on the same substrate, high and low resistive value integrated resistors with consequential semplified micrccircuit implementation.
