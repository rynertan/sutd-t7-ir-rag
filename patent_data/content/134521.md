# Disc brake assembly.

## Abstract
An improved braking piston for a disc brake is of the type which includes a disc mounted for rotation about an axle and a brake housing mounted on the axle in alignment with a friction surface of the disc. The braking piston has an interior end at least partially mounted within the housing and an external end outwardly of the housing adjacent the friction surface of the disc. A powershaft is mounted within the housing in coaxial alignment with the braking piston and is capable of selective rotation by an air disc brake actuator mounted on the housing. The powershaft has worm gear teeth engaged with mating teeth on the interior end of the braking piston. The improvement includes providing the braking piston with a plurality of axially extending splines about an exterior surface of the interior end to mate with corresponding splines on an interior surface of the housing to limit rotation of the braking piston relative to the housing while allowing axial movement thereof directly correspond ing to the selective rotation of the powershaft.
