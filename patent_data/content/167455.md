# Vibration damping composite laminate.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a vibration damping composite laminate of the type comprising a viscoelastic polymer composition layer interposed between two layers of metal, which is high in the damping effectiveness and can readily be spot welded to metal structures. Essentially the polymer composition is a blend of a polyvinyl acetal resin and particulate carbon which amounts to 10 80 wt of the composition, on condition that the ratio of the mean particle size of the particulate carbon to the thickness of the polymer composition layer is from 0.5 to 1.7. Optionally the polymer composition may further com prise a polyolefine resin and or a plasticizer.
