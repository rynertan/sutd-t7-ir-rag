## Abstract
Compositions for textile treatment comprising an admixture of a an aqueous emulsion based on a copolymer of a monomeric mixture containing 0.5 to 50 , preferably 2 to 40 and most preferably 4 to 30 by weight of an oxirane containing monoethylenically unsaturated ma terial, and at least one other monoethylenically unsatur ated material and b a water soluble or water dispersible polyamine which is comprised of at least one segment of formula A, consisting of repeating alkylenimine units CH CH N The compositions may be used at low application le vels so that wool containing textiles in particular may be rendered shrink resistant without impairment to their handle, colour, strength or to other desirable properties of the fibre.
