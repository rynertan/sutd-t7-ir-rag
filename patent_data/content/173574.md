# ASPHALT SEPARATION AND HEAVY OIL EXTRACTION TREATMENT

## Abstract
The removal of asphalt from heavy oil is accomplished by delivering the heavy oil, mixed with pentane, to the in terior of a drum 10 provided with screw flights 38 . The asphalt precipitates and rotation of the drum effects separa tion by progressive decantation. Delivery of washing solvent at 52 and steam at 54 to different regions of the drum 10 leads to discharge of asphalt which is well separated from traces of the crude oil. The process is advantageously utilised in connection with enhanced oil recovery. Coal and limestone area added at 58, 60 to the discharged asphalt and briquetted at 68 to a solid fuel used to provide process heat for enhanced oil recovery operations with an advantageous financial econ omy.
