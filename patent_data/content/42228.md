## Description
METHOD OF PROTECTING PLANTS FROM INSECT PESTS. This invention relates to a method of protecting crops from insect pests using carbamate compounds, to certain of the carbamate compounds themselves, o a process for preparing them and to agricultural compositions containing them. One possible way of protecting crops from insect pests is to apply to the crops or to the locus of the crop a chemical compound which has the property of attracting or repelling that insect pest. Compounds capable of doing this are known to occur in nature, usually in plants and insects. Most of these compounds influence the behaviour of the male insect when the compound is released by the female of that particular insect species. These compounds are known as pheromones and, in addition to naturally occurring pheromones, a number of synthetic pheromone have been prepared. However, there are some compounds known in nature which influence the behaviour of female insects for example by discouraging or encouraging the female insect to lay eggs. Such compounds can be referred to as oviposition inhibitors or stimulators. We have now found a group of synthetic compounds which have oviposition inhibiting or stimulating properties. The invention provides a method of protecting a crop from insect pests, the method comprising applying to the crop, to the locus of the crop of to a locus remote from the crop, a compound of general formula tI or II CH3 CH2 kCH CH CH2 mCH CH x CH2 nOCONR1R2 I CH3 CH2 pOCONR1R2 II wherein k is 0 or an integer of 1 to 3, m is 0, 1 or 2, n is an integer of 5 to 8, x is 0 or 1, p is an integer of 11 to 18, and each of R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, is hydrogen or C14 alkyl. The compounds of general formula I form geometrical isomers. The invention includes within its scope such isomers each of which can be isolated from mixtures thereof by methods known in the art. The double bond s in the compounds of general formula I is are generally in the Z configuration but in some cases a double bond is in the E configuration. TVhen R1 and or R2 is alkyl, it is suitably methyl, but alternatively it can be ethyl, propyl n or i propyl or butyl n , sec , t or i butyl . Preferably one ofR1 and R2 is hydrogen and the other is methyl. Examples of the compounds of general formulae I and II are given in Tables II and I, respectively.

Compound 12 is a mixture of 50 N methyl Z,Zhexadeca 9,12 dien l yl carbamate and 50 of its Z, Eisomer. The compounds of general formula I and most of the compounds of general formula II are novel compounds and as such form part of the invention. The invention provides a compound of general formula I or II CH3 CH2 kCH CH CH2 mCH CHx CH2 nOCONR1R2 I CH3 CH2 pOCONR1R2 II wherein k is 0 or an integer of 1 to 3, m is 0, 1 or 2, n is an integer of 5 to 8, x is 0 or 1, p is an integer of 11 to 18, and each of R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, is hydrogen or C14 alkyl, subject to the proviso that when R1 is hydrogen and R2 is proviso that when is methyl, p is other than 11, 12 or 14. The compounds of general formula I or II can be prepared reacting an alcohol of general formula IIIA or IIIB . CH3 CH2 kCH CH CH2 mCH CH x CH2 nOH IIIA CH3 CH2 pOH IIIB wherein k, m, x, n and p are as defined above, with a compound of general formula IVA or IVB R1N C O IVA R1R2NCOCl IVB wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above except that they cannot both be hydrogen, and k, m, x and n are as defined above. Alternatively, the compounds of general formula I or II can be prepared by reacting an alcohol of general formula IIIA or IIIB with phosgene to give a compound of general formula VA or VB CH3 CH2 kCH CH CH2 mCH CH x CH2 nOCOCl VA CH3 CH2 pOH VB wherein k, m, x, n and p are as defined above, which is then reacted with a compound of general formula R1R2NH wherein each of R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, is hydrogen or C14 alkyl, or a salt thereof. Some at least of the alcohol starting material are known compounds. They can be prepared by methods known in the art. Suitable insects for treatment with the compounds of general formula I or II are Lepidoptera sp.especially Choristoneura sp. eg C fumiferana and C.virgifera , rice stem borers eg Chilo suppressalis ,Pectinophora gossypiella, Heliothis sp. e.g. H. zear H.virescens and 1. armigera and Spodopteran sp. e.g. S.littoralis and S. exigua . The crops which can be protected from insect pests using the method of the invention are, for example, trees eg spruce , cereals eg rice and maize , cotton and tobacco. The amount of the compounds applied to the crops is suitably 1 to 1000, preferably 5 to 100, g. per hectare. Most of the compounds of general formula I and II are oviposition inhibitors. These would normally be used in the method of the invention by applying the compound to the crop which it is desired to protect the female insects would then be inhibited from laying eggs on the crop. However, some of the compounds may be oviposition stimulators such compounds could be used either by applying them to a locus remote from the crop which it is desired to protect and then the female insects would lay their eggs away from the crop or by applying them to a limited area of the crop which is treated with a conventional insect control means for example an insecticide . The compounds may be used as such for protecting crops from insect pests, but are more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The invention thus provides also an agricultural composition comprising a novel compound of general formula I or II as hereinbefore defined, and a carrier or diluent. The compounds can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied, in a formulated or unformulated state, to the foliage of a crop, for example they can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or they can be applied as a vapour.Application can be to any part of the crop, for example to the foliage, stems or branches. The term crop as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. The compounds are preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of a c√∂ffiposition. The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders or granules comprising the active ingredient and a solid diluent or carrier, for example fillers such as kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth, gypsum, Hewitt s earth, diatomaceous earth and China clay.Such granules can be reformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatment. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active ingredient and powdered filler.Compositions for dressing seed, for example, may comprise an agent for example a mineral oil for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for seed dressing purposes using an organic solvent for example N methylpyrrolidone or dimethylformamide . The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspending agents. The aqueous dispersions or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in an organic solvent optionally containing wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s . Suitable organic solvents are ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes, trichloroethylener furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydro furfuryl alcohol, and glycol ethers e.g.2 ethoxyethanol and 2 butoxyethanol . The compositions to be used as sprays may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure in the presence of a propellant, e.g. fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluornmethane. The compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. It is preferred, however, that the compounds are used in a micro encapsulated form. Microencapsulation techniques are known in the aro They can be made by inter facial polycondensation of suitable monomer s , for example a diacid chloride and diamine can be polycondensed to give a polyamide.The microcapsules can contain, in addition to the act ingredient and carriers or diluents, ultraviolet light absorbing agents and antioxidants. The compounds can be employed in other slow release forms e.g. contained in hollow fibres or plastic laminar strips. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. The compositions may also be in the form of liquid preparations for use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or surfactants e.g.wetting agent s , dispersing agent s emulsifying agent s or suspending agent s . These agents can be cationic, anionic or non ionic agents. Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid for example sodium lauryl sulphate , and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulph√≤nate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium diisopropyl and triisopropyl naphthalene sulphonates Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl or nonyl phenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and the vegetable gums for example gum acacia and gum tragancanth . The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient s , the concentrate to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95 , suitably 10 85 , for example 25 60 , by weight of the active ingredient s . The concentrates suitably contain a high proportion of surfactants so that sufficiently stable emulsions in water can be obtained.After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0005 orO.Ol to 10 by weight of active ingredient√ás may be used. The compositions of this invention can comprise also other compound s having biological activity, ecg. compounds having insecticidal, plant growth regulating, herbicidal or fungicidal activity.
