## Description
The present invention pertains to a moisture absorbing, water absorbing, deodorizing, or fragrance enhancing cloth and to a method for producing such cloth. Moisture absorbing and water absorbing cloth have been manufactured for a long time. Recently, however, the demand for them is increasing for sanitary and deodorizing purposes. Demand will expand year by year at an increasing rate. The structure of these cloths has remained unchanged, and they have many defects. Typical examples are described in the following paragraphs. As the basic structure, two sheets of nonwoven cloth are bonded together, with the powdered moisture absorbing, water absorbing, deodorizing, or fragrance enhancing agent below the phrase water absorbing, deodorizing, or fragrance enhancing agent is omitted sandwiched between them. Figure 1 shows a cross section. Adhesive The powdered moisture absorbing agent The moisture absorbing, water absorbing, deodorizing, and fragrance enhancing cloths the words water absorbing, deodorizing, and fragrance enhancing are omitted in the following made in this way suffer from the following disadvantages. The powdered moisture absorbing agent See Figure 2A. In Example 2, in contrast to Example 1, no powdered moisture absorbing agent is in contact with the adhesive. Therefore, none of the surface area of the moisture absorbing particles is covered, and as a result, all surfaces of the particles are effective in absorbing moisture. Nevertheless, Example 2 suffers from the disadvantage that the powdered moisture absorbing agent, which is not fixed in place, can move about freely, because it is not in contact with the adhesive. As can be seen in Figure 2B, the particles of the moisture absorbing agent The present invention is based on the task of improving the performance of the moisture absorbing, water absorbing, deodorizing, and fragrance enhancing cloths in such a way that the thickness of the cloth remains uniform and its appearance and touch are improved. The present invention has the goal of providing highly effective moisture absorbing, water absorbing, deodorizing, and fragrance enhancing cloths, in which nonwoven cloth layers are bonded together without the moisture absorbing particles sandwiched between them being covered over by adhesive. In the present invention, a basic invention entitled Method for Applying Hot Melt Adhesive Foam and Products Obtained by this Method , as described in Japanese Patent Application No. S 60 6501 submitted by the present applicant Nordson K.K. is adapted to the present method of producing moisture absorbing, water absorbing, deodorizing, and fragrance enhancing cloths and to the products obtained by this method. In other words, the present invention comprises the moisture absorbing, water absorbing, deodorizing, and fragrance enhancing cloths which are characterized in that several layers of nonwoven cloth are bonded together by a hot melt adhesive foam applied so as to form a spiderweb like structure, and in that a powdered moisture absorbing, water absorbing, deodorizing, or fragrance enhancing agent is scattered in the spaces between the fibers of the spiderweb structure. The invention also pertains to a method for producing the cloths described above. The essence of the present invention is a method for applying hot melt adhesive foam to the surface of a substrate by means of hot air spraying and the products obtained by this method. In the conventional method, a hot melt adhesive foam is applied to the surface of a substrate by extrusion from a nozzle. In the basic invention cited above, however, the adhesive is applied by spraying with air. When the adhesive is sprayed, it is applied in the form of a spiderweb like structure if the viscosity of the adhesive and the temperature of the air are suitable. The layer of bonding agent in the form of a spiderweb formed by a hot melt adhesive foam as described above adheres very strongly to substrates, especially when their surface is rough, such as the surface of nonwoven cloth, which consists of irregular arrangements of many short fibers. The present invention is characterized in that the hot melt adhesive foam is applied to the surface of nonwoven cloth to form a spiderweb like structure and in that the necessary amount of particles is scattered in the spaces between the fibers of the spiderweb structure. The hot melt foam used in the invention is described below. Foamable hot melt adhesives include nonvulcanized rubber based thermoplastic resins, saturated polyester based thermoplastic resins, polyamide based thermoplastic resins, EVA, and polyolefin based thermoplastic resins. These resins can be copolymerized and modified in various ways. After the resin has been melted, N₂, CO₂ and various other gases are incorporated into the adhesive in the form of numerous air bubbles. As a result, the volume of the resin increases by a factor of 1.5 to 10. The hot melt adhesive foam not only retains its primary property of adhesion but also has many other advantages for the bonding process a lower specific gravity, which means that the amount of bonding agent required is reduced a lower apparent viscosity under high pressure in the applicator less fluidity after application a thinner adhesion layer and a larger adhesion area under bonding pressure a shortened setting time improved adhesion capacity to porous and rough surfaces a reduced surface heat capacity, which prevents thermal deformation when the adhesive is applied to thin plastic films or other thin materials an increase in the feasibility of low temperature applications because of the rapid cooling of the surface increased flexibility improved sealability softness and improved touch light weight increased open time during manufacturing and reduced overall cost. The structure of the moisture absorbing cloth according to the invention is described below. There are four basic structures Figure 3A shows a cross section of this structure, and Figure 3B shows a transverse section. Two sheets of nonwoven cloth In the latter case, if the quantity of hygroscopic agent is increased, the surfaces of the fibers of the spiderweb structure become covered by the hygroscopic agent, which decreases the adhesive power of the bonding agent. Therefore, the ratio between the amount of bonding agent to that of hygroscopic agent must be adapted to the use, to the grade of moisture absorbing cloth, to the quality of the nonwoven cloth, and to the type of hot melt adhesive foam. The optimum ratio must be selected in consideration of all these factors. As shown in Figure 4, one of the two sheets of nonwoven cloth can be replaced by a layer of woven cloth or by a sheet of plastic See Figure 5. In structure 2, three or more layers of nonwoven cloth See Figure 7. Between the two layers of nonwoven cloth In structure 3, furthermore, one of the two layers of nonwoven cloth can again be replaced by a layer of woven cloth or by a sheet of plastic See Figure 9. In structure 4, several layers of the above mentioned structure 3 are stacked. In other words, Layer IIa, which represents structure 3, is stacked on top of Layer Ia, which also represents structure 3. If desired, Layer IIIa can be stacked on top of Layer IIa. In this case, however, only one sheet of nonwoven cloth is sandwiched between these layers. As shown in Figure 10, one of these several sheets of nonwoven cloth or only the outside layer can be replaced by a layer of woven cloth or by a sheet of plastic The method for producing the cloth according to the invention is described below. Before the explanation of the method is presented, however, it is necessary to provide a brief outline of Japanese Patent Application No. S 60 6501 of the present applicant entitled Method for Applying Hot Melt adhesive Foam and Products Obtained by this Method , which is the basis of the present invention. First, the hot melt adhesive is heated and melted in the hot melt applicator. Gas is mixed into the hot melt adhesive, and pressure is applied to it. The pressurized adhesive passes through a pressure resistant an heat resistant hose and is sprayed out through the nozzle of an extruder. The temperature of the air varies widely depending on the type of hot melt adhesive and can range between 100 and 500 C. The way in which the basic invention works is described below. As already mentioned, the hot melt adhesive foam is a thermoplastic resin of comparatively high viscosity, which has been heated and melted, and into which air or other gas has been incorporated under pressure. When the thermoplastic resin is released into the atmosphere through the nozzle, it foams and is then atomized by an air sprayer. On expansion, the pressure drops immediately from about 800 psi 56 kg cm² to atmospheric pressure. At the same time, the very small bubbles of compressed gas swell up to about 50 times their original size in other words, a foam is created almost explosively. The thin film produced as a result is not in the form of the large, aggregated particles which are characteristic of conventional hot melt adhesives on the contrary, the film is built up of very small, atomized particles produced by the hot air ejected from the nozzle. Many of the hot melt adhesives consist of polymer substances and are based on synthetic resins. They are highly adhesive. Therefore, when they are scattered by the spray process, the very tiny particles tend to string together. These strings of very small particles then form a spiderweb like structure. This spiderweb like structure can form a comparatively uniform film on the surface of uneven fibers, especially on glass wool. This is a great advantage of hot melt adhesive foam. Therefore, the hot melt adhesive foam can be considered the most suitable agent for bonding aluminum leaf or foil to glass wool mats, for bonding nonwoven cloth layers to each other, and for bonding woven cloth, plastic sheets, etc. The production method according to the invention is explained below on the basis of the above mentioned basic invention entitled Method for Applying Hot Melt Adhesive Foam and Products Obtained by this Method . There are four different methods used, one for each of the four different types of moisture absorbing cloth described above. This is a method for producing the moisture absorbing cloth with structure 1 see Figures 3A, 3B, and 4 . First, hot melt foam is sprayed to form a spiderweb like structure on one side of a layer of nonwoven cloth This is a method for producing the moisture absorbing cloth with structure 2 explained above see Figures 5 and 6 . Structure 2 is obtained by stacking several layers of structure 1. Since method 2 consists merely in a repetition of method 1, a detailed explanation can be omitted. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the heating and pressing step should not be carried out for each new layer, but rather all at once after all the layers have been stacked. This is so that thermal energy and labor can be minimized. When the layers are thick, more time will be required. In this case, it is desirable to use an endless steel belt system as shown in Figure 16. This is a method for producing the moisture absorbing cloth with structure 3 see Figure 7 . First, the hot melt adhesive foam is sprayed to form a spiderweb like structure One of the two layers of nonwoven cloth can be replaced by a layer of woven cloth or by a sheet of plastic This is a method for producing the moisture absorbing cloth with structure 4 see Figure 9 . Structure 4 is constructed by stacking layers of structure 3. Since method 4 consists merely in a repetition of method 3, a detailed explanation can be omitted. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the process of heating and applying pressure should not be done each time a layer is added, but rather all at once after all the layers have been stacked. This is to conserve thermal energy and labor. One of the two layers of nonwoven cloth, i.e., the one at the top or the one at the bottom, can be replaced by a sheet of plastic The hygroscopic agent used to produce the moisture absorbing cloth can be a drying agent such as silica gel, aluminum or calcium chloride, etc. The particles of these agents should be comparatively small, however. The moisture absorbing cloth of the invention can be used for bed sheets, in underware by combining it with other material, for perspiration absorbing sheets and other products in sheet form, as linings for hats, as insoles for shoes, and for many other purposes as well. Although the description given above pertains to products in which hygroscopic agents have been incorporated, a water absorbing agent FG 801 S N from Nittetsu Kogaku can also be used to make water absorbing cloth. A water absorbing cloth literally means a cloth capable of absorbing liquids, and such cloths are being used to an increasing extent in products such as disposable diapers and sanitary articles. In addition, it is also possible to produce a deodorizing cloth by incorporating a deodorizing agent such as activated charcoal. It is also possible to produce a fragrance enhancing cloth by incorporating a fragrance. In these cases, it will be possible to make a variety of products by combining various such agents between the layers of nonwoven cloth. The moisture absorbing, water absorbing, deodorizing, and fragrance enhancing cloth according to the invention makes maximum use of the absorbent areas of all particles of the moisture absorbing, water absorbing, deodorizing, or fragrance enhancing agent, etc., which are present in these products, because the absorption areas are kept unobstructed. The absorbing and scenting effects as well as the external appearance of such cloth products are also improved by the invention. In addition, the present invention makes it possible to produce these types of cloth more efficiently and at less cost.
