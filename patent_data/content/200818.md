## Description
The present invention relates to novel derivatives of antibiotics of the pluramycin group that exhibit antitumor activity as well as a method of producing the same. Three antibiotics of the pluramycin group are known to be obtained from cultures of actinomycetes and these antibiotics are kidamycin of the formula II EMI1.1 wherein R1 and R2 are eachEMI1.2 or a hydrogen atom Mr. Furukawa et al. Tetrahedron, 31, 2989 2995, 1975 pluramycin of the same formula II wherein R1 andR2 are eachEMI1.3 or an acetyl group S. Kondo et al J. Antibiotics, 30, 1143 1145, 1977 neopluramycin of the formula II wherein R1 and R2 are eachEMI2.1 or an acetyl group S. Kondo et al. J. Antibiotics, 30, 1143 1145, 1977 . These antibiotics exhibit strong action to inhibit the growth of cultured leukemia cell P 388 and intensiveR efforts have been made to use these antibiotics as cancer control agents. As mentioned above, the antibiotics of the pluramycin group exhibit strong anti tumor activity in vivo and have been closely studied to exploit their potential use as ean cer control agents. However, these antibiotics themselves cause kidney toxicity and other adverse side effects in laboratory animals and it has been desired to mitigate such adverse side effects. Therefore, it has been searched for a variety of derivatives of the pluramycin group antibiotics that would have reduced side effects while retaining the high anti tumor activity of such antibiotics. As a result, it has been found that compounds of the formula I EMI2.2 wherein R1 isEMI3.1 R is a hydrogen atom or an acetyl group, provided that when R2 is a hydrogen atom, R1 isEMI3.2 show reduced side effects although they are somewhat inferior to the corresponding known antibiotics of the pluramycin group in terms of in vivo anti tumor activity. The inventors have also found that these compounds of formula I can be readily obtained by illuminating solutions or suspensions of kidamycin, pluramycin or neopluramycin in inert solvents with ultraviolet radiation. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these findings. The compounds in accordance with the present invention are novel and different in chemical structure from the starting pluramycin group antibiotics in that they have 5,6 dehydroangolosamine obtained by dehydrogenation at 5 and 6 positions in the angolosamine group of a specific pluramycin group antibiotic. The compounds recited in claim 1 are hereunder designated as noted below depending upon the antibiotics from which they are originated.EMI3.3 tb R1 SEP in SEP formula SEP 1 SEP R2 SEP in SEP formula SEP I SEP Designation tb C CH CH3 SEP H SEP 5 ,6 dehydro tb SEP CH3 SEP kidamycin tb C CH CH3 SEP COCH3 SEP 5 ,6 dehydro tb SEP CH3 SEP neopluramycin tb SEP 0 tb C CH CH CH CH3 SEP COCH3 SEP 5 SEP ,6 dehydro tb SEP CH3 SEP pluramycin tb The compounds of formula I in accordance with the present invention have the following effects and advantages.A. Anti tumor activity A suspension of 1 x 105 L 1210 leukemia cells was transplated intraperitoneally in each of the CDF1 mice tested. Thereafter, 5 ,6 dehydrokidamycin was injected intraperitoneally for 10 days in predetermined amounts, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625 and 0.3125 mg kg. The treated mice were observed for 30 days following the inJection and the percent life prolongation of each mouse was checked, with the number of days for which control mice administered physiological saline survived being taken as 100. Dose Percent life mg kg day prolongation 10 153 5 173 2.5 133 1.25 133 0.625 133 0.3125 147B. Acute toxicity LD50 The LD50 of 5 ,6 dehydrokidamycin for a single intraperitoneal injection in mice was 100 mg kg. C. Cytotoxicity The growth of cultured leukemia cell L 1210 was inhibited by 0.07 iig ml lOso of 5 ,6 dehydrokidamycin. As shown above, the compound of the present invention exhibits strong anti tumor activity against cultured leu kemia cell L 1210 while causing low toxicity. Therefore, the compound is expected to be useful as a cancer control agent. The compounds recited in claim 1, namely, 5 ,6 de hydrokidamycin,5 ,6 dehydropluramycin, and 5 ,6 dehydroneopluramycin can be produced in high yields from kidamycin, pluramycin and neopluramycin, respectively by irradiation with ultraviolet light. For example, these starting antibiotics may be dissolved or suspended in inert solvents and exposed to ultraviolet radiation so as to convert them to the respective end compounds. The resulting compounds may be isolated in pure form from the reaction system by any of the known isolation and purification methods. The ultraviolet treatment may be performed with a W irradiator, Tomy Seiko TV 40 Tomy Seiko Co., Ltd. which is positioned 30 cm away from the target and irradiates tnT light 100 volts and 15 watts for 1 2 hours at room temperature. The intensity and duration of W irradiation are properly determined by the type of inert solvent used and the concentration of starting antibiotic but are by no means critical for the purposes of the present invention. With the intensity of W radiation, temperature and duration of irradiation given in the previous paragraph, the concentration of a particular starting antibiotic may be set in the range of 250 1,000 g ml. The present invention is hereunder described in greater detail by reference to Examples.Example 1Production of 5 ,6 dehydrokidamycin A solution of kidamycin 5 mg in methanol 20 ml was placed in a petri dish ID 8.5 cm and illuminated with W radiation for 2 hours from Tomy Seiko TV 40 100 volts, 15 watts 30 cm away from the petri dish. Methanol was distilled off under vacuum and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography on Nucleosil 5C18 column 20 mm x 300 mm, Macherey Nagel using an acetonitrile0.1M phosphate buffer 3 7 at pH 3.0 as a mobile phase.The eluate was adjusted to pH 7.0 with sodium bicarbonate and subjected to extraction with chloroform. After destilling off the chloroform under vacuum, the residue was dissolved in methanol and loaded onto a Sephadex LH 20 column 15 mm x 170 mm . The column was eluted with methanol and the active fractions were collected and evaporated to dryness under vacuum to produce 3.6 mg of 5 ,6 dehydrokidamy cin. mp. 165 167 C decomposed .
