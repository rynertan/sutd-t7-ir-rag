Lens system for 3 D filming comprises a pair of nega tive achromatic lenses 42, 44 horizontally spaced substan tially on the interpupillary distance. Behind these front lens es 42, 44 a pair of tilted rhomboid prisms 64, 66 fold the optical paths to be closely positioned one above the other. On these paths, rear lens systems 112, 114 focus the images onto the film plane 158 in upper and lower frame halves. The forward negative achromatic lenses 42, 44 are adjustable fore and aft for focus adjustment, and the rear lens systems 112, 114 are laterally adjustable for conver gence control.
