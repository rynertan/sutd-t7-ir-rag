## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION OF NICARDIPINE.AND 1, 2 DIOXY OMEGA TRIALKYLAMMONIUM COMPOUNDS This invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation of nicardipine and glycerol based cationic surfactants. The invention comprises a pharmaceutical formulation comprising nicardipine hydrochloride and a compound of the formula IEMI1.1 or an optical isomer thereof wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and are alkyl or alkenyl of 6 to 22 carbons R3, R4 and R5 may be the same or different and are hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 8 carbons, aryl, aralkyl of 7 to 11 carbons or when two or three of R3, R4, and R5 are taken together to form quinuclidino, piperidino, pyrrolidino, or morpholino n is 1 to 8 andX is a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. The formulations of this invention may comprise liposomes, gels, creams, lotions, emulsions, suspensions, syrups, aerosols and the like. Accordingly, these formulations may employ one or more additional pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in order to optimize the workability, formulation of, stability, etc.of these formulations. If the formulation is a liposome, additional excipients such as water or a buffer will be employed in order to form the liposomes. Liposome formulations may also employ other surfactants, fatty acids and the like which are known in the liposome formulation art. The preparation of topical creams, gels, ointments and the like will require the use of excipients which are routinely used in those arts for proper formulation of such formulations. Orally acceptable formulations will necessarily employ those additional excipients which have been developed in that art. A preferred compositional form for this invention is liposomes. Liposomes are microscopic vesicles or blisters consisting of concentric lipid bilayers, generally spherically shaped. Structurally, liposomes range in size and shape from long tubes to spheres, with dimensions of a few hundred Angstr√∂ms to fractions of a millimeter. Regardless of the overall shape, the bilayers are generally organized as closed concentric lamellae, with an aqueous layer separating each lamella from its neighbor. Vesicle size normally ranges between 20 50,000 nm in diameter. The liquid film between lamellae is usually 3 10 nm. In the broadest terms, liposomes are prepared from one or more surfactants. Though it has been thought that any type of surfactant could be used in liposomes, e.g.cationic, neutral or anionic surfactants, experience with positively charged liposomes has indicated several problems which have not been fully addressed to date.The tertiary amines which have been employed in liposomes to date have either not been sufficiently chemically stable to allow for the storage of such formulations shelf life or the structure of the amines has been such that they can be leached out of the liposome structure.Also one of the tertiary amines, stearoylamine, has toxicity concerns which limit its use. Compounds of formula I do not suffer from these infirmities. The ether linkage is highly stable in liposomes. The compounds of formula I are not leached out of nor do they otherwise migrate out of the liposome matrix as do stearoylamines and other amines of that type. Toxicity is not a concern with the compounds formula I. Positively charged formulations, particularly liposomes, are pharmaceutically advantageous. Mammalian cells are negatively charged so the presentation of positively charged materials results in better attachment to and absorption by membranes. Typically, the liposome formulations of this invention will be comprised of 0.05 to 10 nicardipine hydrochloride by weight, 1 to 20 surfactant by weight of which a compound of formula I comprises 1 to 100 of this surfactant component and an aqueous solution, that is water which may or may not contain salts and buffers, in a quantity sufficient to make 100 by volume.Particularly preferred are formulations which contain 1 to 5 nicardipine hydrochloride, and a compound of formula I comprises 50 or more by weight of the surfactant component. Most preferred is a formulation which contains 5 nicardipine hydrochloride by weight, a compound of formula I comprises the only surfactant component which component is present in an amount of 20 by weight and an amount of aqueous solution sufficient q.s. to make 100 by volume. Formulations of this invention, particularly liposomes, made with the compounds of formula I will exhibit the properties of a positively charged entity when formula I comprises 1 or more by weight with a neutral liposome forming material. Thus, other excipients, surfactants and the like which are used for making liposomes, can be used in these formulations. One may use any combination of secondary surfactants with the compounds of formula I so long as there is 1 or more of formula I present in the formulation. Secondary surfactants which can be used are, for example, ternary or complex lipids, glycerides, cerides, etholides and sterides, namely one of several compounds wherein the hydrophilic group is phosphate, carboxylate, sulfate, amino, hydroxyl and choline group and the lipophilic group is alkyl or alkenyl, polyoxyalkylene and an alkyl group substituted with at least one aromatic or cycloalkyl group. Polyethyleneoxy or glycol groups may be used. Additional surfactants suitable for incorporation into these formulations can be found in the McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers andMcCutcheon s Functional Materials, Allured Pub. Co.,Ridgewood, N.J., U.S.A. Preferred secondary surfactants are phospholipid related materials such as, for example, lecithin, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, lysolecithin, lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, cephalin, cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid, cerebrosides, dicetyl phosphate, phosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Additonal, non phosphorus containing lipids are, for instance, cetyl palmitate, glyceryl ricinoleate, hexadecyl stearate, isopropyl myristate, amphoteric acrylic polymers, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, alkanoyl aryl sulfonates, and the like. Additional additives may be long chain alcohols and diols sterols, for example, cholesterol phosphoric esters of fatty alcohols, for example, sodium dicetyl phosphate alkylsulfates, for example sodium cetyl sulfate certain polymers such as polypeptides and proteins. Typically, liposomes can be divided into three categories based on their overall size and the nature of the lamellar structure. The three classifications, as developed by the New York Academy Sciences Meeting on, Liposomes and Their Use in Biology and Medicine, ofDecember 1977, are multi lamellar vesicles MLV , small uni lamellar vesicles SUV and large uni lamellar vesicles LUV . SUV s range in diameter from approximately 20 50 nm and consist of a single lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous compartment. While SUV are single compartmental vesicles of fairly uniform size, MLV vary greatly in size up to 10,000 nm, or thereabouts, are multi compartmental in their structure, and contain more than one bilayer. LUV liposomes are so named because of their large diameter which ranges from about 600 nm to 30,000 nm they contain more than one bilayer. Liposomes may be prepared by a number of methods not all of which produce the three different types of liposomes. For example, ultrasonic dispersion by means of immersing the metal probe directly into a suspension of MLV s is a common way for preparing SUV s. Preparing liposomes of the MLV class usually involves dissolving the lipids in an appropriate organic solvent and then drying down the solvent under a gas or air stream. This leaves behind a thin film of dry lipid on the surface of the container. An aqueous solution is then introduced into the container with shaking in order to free lipid material from the sides of the container. This process disperses the lipid, causing it to form into lipid aggregates or liposomes. Liposomes of the LUV variety may be made by slow hydration of a thin layer of lipid with distilled water or an aqueous solution of some sort. Alternatively, liposomes may be prepared by lyophilization. This process comprises drying down lipids to a film under a stream of nitrogen. This film is then dissolved in a volatile solvent, frozen, and placed on a lyophilization apparatus to remove the solvent. A solution of drug is then added to the lyophilized lipids whereupon liposomes are formed. A variety of methods for preparing various liposome forms have been described in the periodical and patent literature. For specific reviews and information on liposome formulations, reference is made to reviews byPagano and Weinstein Ann. Rev. Biophysic. Bioeng., 7, pp. 435 68 1978 and Szoka and Papahadjopoulos Ann.Rev. Biophysic. Bioeng., 9, pp. 467 508 1980 and additionally to a number of patents, for example, U.S.Patent Nos. 4,229,360 4,224,179 4,127,344 4,193,893 4,217,344 4,241,046 4,078,052 and 4,235,871. The compounds of this invention may be prepared as a racemic mixture of D,L isomers, or as the individual Dor L isomer. Because of the availability of D or L starting materials, certain of these compounds are readily prepared as the individual isomer. However, unless the specific isomer is designated, it should be understood that this invention covers both pure D or Lisomers as well as the D,L racemate. Compounds of formula 1 have one asymmetric site, marked above as , and thus can exist as diastereomers. Individual isomers of compounds of formula 1 are named herein using the IUPAC R S convention, sometimes called the sequence rule. A description of the R S convention may be found, for example, in Introduction to Organic Chemistry by A.Streitwieser, Jr. and C. Heathcock, Macmillan Pub. Co.,New York, 1976 , pages 110 114. Where appropriate, the optical activity of a compound may be indicated by , , or , referring to the direction in which a solution of the compound rotates a plane of polarized light. Nicardipine hydrochloride, a cerebral and coronary vasodilator with calcium blocking activity, is otherwise known as methyl 1,4 dihydro 2,6 dimethyl 2 E methyl phenylmethyl amino ethyl 4 3 nitrophenyl 3, 5 pyridinedicarboxylic acid ester monohydrochloride. ItsCAS numbers are 54527 84 3 or 55985 32 5.

Aryl refers to benzene or naphthalene. Aralkyl of 7 to 11 carbons refers to a radical having an alkyl group to which is attached a benzene ring such as the benzyl radical, phenethyl, 3 phenylpropyl, or the like. A pharmaceutically acceptable anion is some anion which itself is not toxic or otherwise pharmaceutically unacceptable and which does not render the compound pharmaceutically unacceptable. Examples of such anions are the halide anions fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo.Inorganic anions such as sulfate, sulfite, phosphate, and nitrate may also be used. Organic anions may be derived from simple organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumeric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methane sulfonic acid, ethane sulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, and the like.

Compounds of formula I of this invention are made by two procedures, depending on the value of n. Where n is 1, the compounds of this invention are derived fromD mannitol. The two central hydroxy groups of mannitol are first protected by formation of a ketal, for example formation of the acetonide. The four remaining hydroxy groups are then converted to ethers using the appropriate long chain fatty acid. This molecule is then chemically split into two units of aldehyde of 3 carbons each, wherein two carbons are substituted with a long chain alkyl or alkenyl group. The aldehyde functionality is then converted to a tertiary amine and then further converted to either the acid addition salt or a quaternary ammonium compound. This process is exemplified by Reaction Scheme I as follows. REACTION SCHEME IEMI10.1 In this reaction scheme R√ö and R√™ are as defined above and R has the same definition as R3, R4, and R5 above. It should be noted that the term acetonide and the term isopropylidine are used interchangably in the following reaction schemes and examples. The D mannitol 3,4 acetonide of formula 1 is a known compound which may be prepared according to the methods of Wiggins, L. F., J. Chem. Soc., 13 1946 or Morpain,C. Tisserand, M., J. Chem. Soc. Perkins Transactions, 1 6 , 1379 1979 . To form the compound of formula 1, perchloric acid is added to a mixture of D mannitol and 2,2 dimethoxypropane in acetone to form 1,2 3,4 5,6triisopropylidine D mannitol. This compound is then dissolved in 70 acetic acid, heated for 1 1 2 hours, and crystallized from ethyl acetate to giveD mannitol 3,4 acetonide. To effect formation of compound 2, the acetonide is dissolved in an appropriate polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, diethylformamide, or the like. To this is added a strong base, such as sodium hydride, at room temperature. This mixture is then heated, preferably between about 300 and 1000C, more preferably to about 500C, with stirring for approximately 30 to 90 minutes, preferably about 60 minutes. To this is then added an alkylating agent of the desired chain length exemplified by the toluenesulfonate ester of oleoyl alcohol or by l bromohexadecane. Following addition of the alkylating agent, the temperature is increased to between about 500 and 1500C, preferably about 900C, with additional stirring over a period of up to 2 hours, preferably about 1 hour. The base heat alkylating agent heat sequence is repeated five times.In the first addition, the base is added in an equal molar amount to the amount of acetonide being used and the alkylating agent is added in an equal molar amount. This sequence of adding a molar amount of base with heating followed by a molar amount of the alkylating ester with heating and stirring is repeated four times for a total of five times in order to effect the formation of compound 2. Compound 3, a mannitol tetraether, is made by hydrolyzing the ketal, illustrated by the acetonide. The hydrolysis is carried out as a single phase reaction using a polar, water soluble organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran. Preferably, the hydrolysis will be effected by means of a 10 solution of water in trifluoroacetic acid. The solution of the mannitol tetraether compound 3 in organic solvent and aqueous acid solution is stirred for approximately one hour at a slightly elevated temperature, approximately 50 C, or thereabouts. The solvent is then evaporated and residual acid removed by azeotropic distillation using a solvent such as toluene. The aldehyde 4 is made by treating diol 3 with an oxidant, preferably one such as lead tetraacetate, in a solvent best illustrated by chloroform. A slight molar excess of lead tetraacetate is used to effect the reaction. The mixture is stirred at about ambient temperature for up to 4 hours, preferably about 2 hours, at which time the excess lead tetraacetate is quenched by addition of ethylene glycol followed quickly by the addition of a substantial amount Of water. The resulting crude aldehydebis recovered by conventional means and may be used without further purification directly in the next step. To effect the formation of the formula 5 amine compound, a di substituted amine hydrochloride the substituents have the definitions for R3, R4, andR5 above is dissolved in an alcohol, preferably methanol, to which solution is added a two thirds molar amount of anhydrous sodium acetate. This mixture is stirred for about an hour at ambient temperature and the resulting sodium chloride is filtered off. The methanol solution is then added to the crude aldehyde from the preceding paragraph. A second solvent, preferably tetrahydrofuran, is then added to this mixture followed by molecular sieves. To this mixture is then added a reducing agent, preferably sodium cyanoborohydride, in a slight molar excess, and the mixture is stirred at a slightly elevated temperature, preferably about 40 to 600C, for up to 3 days.This product is then converted to the hydrochloride salt by addition of an organic solvent through which HC1 gas has been bubbled. The quaternary ammonium compound is then prepared by condensing an alkyl or aralkyl chloride into a reaction vessel containing the tri substituted amine material, after which the reaction vessel is sealed and heated to about 500 to 1000C, preferably about 700C, for up to 48 hours. This procedure affords the trialkylammonium chloride product of formula I wherein each R can beR3, R4, or R5 as defined above with the proviso that when any of R3, R , or R5 is defined as aryl then that aryl group is present on the tri substituted amine . Alternatively, when compounds of Formula I, wherein n is 1 and R1 and R2 are not the same, are to be made, they can be prepared by the flowchart of ReactionScheme II which follows. REACTION SCHEME II EMI13.1 In this reacton scheme, R is benzyl. R1 and R2 are defined herein above, R1 being different from R2. The 2,5 dibenzyl D mannitol of formula 7 was prepared by the procedure of Baggett, N., Stribblehil, 3. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 1323 1977 . Concentrated sulfuric acid is added to a solution of D mannitol and benzaldehyde in dimethylformamide. After stirring for 3 days at room temperature, the solution is poured into a mixture of ice water, potassium carbonate, and petroleum ether. The 1,3 4,6 di 0 benzilidine D mannitol is then dissolved in benzyl chloride and powdered potassium hydroxide is added. The mixture is heated to 1400C for 3 hours, then cooled and diluted with water. Extraction with chloroform followed by washing with water gives 2, 5 di O benzyl l,3 4, 6 di 0 benzilidine D mannitol. This compound is dissolved in ethanol and water and treated with 1M HC1. After refluxing for 4 1 2 hours the reaction mixture is cooled, quenched with barium carbonate, and evaporated to dryness. The solid residue is triturated with hot ethyl acetate which is then evaporated to yield 2,5 di 0 benzyl D mannitol. The dibenzyl D mannitol is dissolved in a dry solvent, for example, acetone, to which is added a half molar amount of copper sulfate and a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid. This solution is stirred at ambient temperature for about 48 hours, at which time the mixture is quenched by means of a weak base, preferably sodium carbonate, and then stirred for an additional period of time to effect the reaction. The solvent is also the source of the ketal. The position 1 and position 6 hydroxyl groups are then etherified by means of a strong base and an l haloalkyl, or l haloalkenyl moiety. The ketal is dissolved in a non polar solvent, such as xylene, toluene, or the like, to which is added a powdered base, such as powdered potassium hydroxide and the l haloalkyl or l haloalkenyl material. This mixture is heated at reflux for about 4 hours in order to effect formation of compound 8. The two benzyl groups are then removed by catalytic hydrogenolysi s in an appropriate solvent such as tetrahydrofuran methanol. A heavy metal catalyst such as 10 palladium on carbon is used. The reaction is carried out in an appropriate hydrogenolysis device, in this instance with heating to about 600 to 80 DC, for about 48 hours under about 60 psi of hydrogen. The diol obtained from the preceding hydrogenolysis is etherified in the same manner described above for preparing compound 9. Once the tetrasubstituted D mannitol 3,4 ketal is obtained, it is converted to formula I by the series of steps recited above for conversion of formula 2 to formula I. Those compounds wherein n is 2 to 8 are prepared from the corresponding triol. The schematic for this reaction sequence is set forth in Reaction Scheme III which follows. This scheme may also be used for preparing compounds wherein n is 1. REACTION SCHEME IIIEMI15.1 In this reaction scheme, R1 and R2 are the same as defined herein above. In formula I, R is the same as R3, R4 and Rg The compounds of formula 12 are known in the literature or may be purchased from a chemical supply house or may be prepared as indicated herein. The ketal of formula 13, preferably the acetonide, is prepared by dissolving the appropriate triol in acetone with the addition of a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid. This reaction may be effected by stirring the solution for up to about 4 hours at room temperature, preferably about 2 hours. The resulting ketal is then recovered by standard separatory means. The unreacted position l hydroxyl group is then protected by forming an allyl ether, compound 14. This reaction is carried out by dissolving the alcohol in a dry dipolar aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamide.A strong base, such as sodium hydride an equal molar amount , is added to the alcohol which is stirred at ambient temperature for a set period and then warmed to between 800 and 100 C for an equal period. Allyl chloride, in about a 50 molar excess, is then added at the elevated temperature with stirring. Stirring and heating is continued for another 30 to 120 minutes, preferably about 60 minutes. The product is then extracted and further purified by chromatographic means. The ketal group is then hydrolyzed by means of a dilute solution of a strong acid, for example, 1N HC1, the reaction being carried out in a polar solvent, such as methanol, ethanol, or the like. Some heat is added to the reaction mixture to effect the hydrolysis.Preferably, the solution is heated to about 500C for about 2 hours. The diol, compound 15, is converted to the diether, compound 16, in the same manner as described above for conversion of formula 1 to formula 2. Here again the etherification carried out in a dry dipolar aprotic solvent, such as dimethylformamide, using a strong base, such as sodium hydride, and the tosyl ester or halide of the appropriate alkyl or alkenyl alcohol. The reaction is repeated twice using a one molar equivalent of alkylating agent each time. As described previously, the reaction is effected at an elevated temperature, preferably between 500 and 1500C, more specifically at about 900C. The position allyl ether, compound 16, is then hydrolyzed by means of Wilkinson s catalyst tris triphenylphosphine , rhodium chloride in an acid medium. The solvent should be a polar solvent such as ethanol, preferably with a co solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The triether catalyst mixture is refluxed for several hours, preferably about 3 hours, at which time additional acid 1N HC1 is added and refluxing continued for several more hours, approximately 3 to 4 hours. These conditions effect hydrolysis of the allyl ether to compound 17. The alcohol, compound 17, is then converted to the amine by first creating an intermediate p toluenesulfonate ester to which is added a di substituted amine to effect formation of the amine compound. By way of illustration, the alcohol is dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as pyridine, to which is added p toluenesulfonyl chloride. This mixture is stirred overnight at ambient temperature, then cooled in ice water and the product recovered by extraction means. The crude product is immediately dissolved in a di substituted amine, preferably dimethylamine, and placed in a sealed container at ambient temperature for about 1 day to effect formation of the tri substituted amine. The alcohol, compound 17, can also be converted to the quarternary amine wherein R3, R4, and or R5 form a ring with the nitrogen by reacting compound of formula 17 with p toluenesulfonyl chloride to give the crude tosylate. This compound can be dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone and sodium iodide is added. The mixture is refluxed for 5 hours. The resulting iodopropane compound is dissolved in dichloromethane and the appropriate cyclic nitrogen containing compound is added. The mixture is sealed in a pressure reactor and heated to 1000C for 48 hours followed by chromatography to obtain the appropriate quarternary ammonium compound in which R3, R4, and R5 form a ring with nitrogen, for example, quinuclidine.Alternatively the alcohol, compound 17, is converted to the tosylate, compound 18, which is then reacted in a sealed pressure reactor to form the quarternary compound without going through the formation of the iodine containing compound. If two of R3, R4, and R5 form a ring with nitrogen, for example, pyrrolidine, piperidine, or morpholine, then alcohol 17 is converted to amine 19 as described above. Amine 19 is then reacted with a di substituted amine hydrochloride to form the corresponding compound of formula I following the same procedures as given above for the reaction of compound 5 to a compound of formula I.

EXAMPLE 23 The following compositions illustrate the use of the instant compounds in pharmaceutical formulations. Nicardipine hydrochloride, 50 mg, 100 mg of N 2,3 di octadecyloxy prop 1 yl N,N,N trimethylammonium chloride and 100 mg dioleoylphosphatidylcholine were dissolved in 5 ml chloroform. The chloroform was removed under a stream of nitrogen and place under vacuum overnight to ensure removal of residual solvent. The resulting film was suspended in 1 ml of purified water and sonicated to clarity. In a similar manner other concentrations of drug in liposome can be prepared. By varying the amount or aqueous solution added to the film, the concentration of nicardipine hydrochloride in the final liposome formulation can be varied between 0.05 and 10 by weight. EXAMPLE 24 The ability to solubilize a drug is increased by use of the compounds and liposomes described above. In this way a greater concentration of a normally insoluble or sparingly soluble drug can be presented to the body. For example, a small unilamellar vesicle SUV formulation containing 12 mg of nicardipine hydrochloride and 65 mg of a 50 50 by weight mixture of N 2,3 di 9 Z octadecenyloxy prop l yl N, N,N trimethylammonium chloride and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine per ml of SUV was prepared as follows The lipids and nicardipine hydrochloride were aliquoted into clean, 10 ml, sonicating glass vials and dried to a thin film by flushing the vials with nitrogen. The vials were protected from light at all times because nicardipine hydrochloride is light sensitive. One ml of 5 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5 was added to each vial, and the vials were vortexed vigorously until all the lipid and nicardipine hydrochloride was suspended to yield a milky solution. The solution has formed multilamellar vesicles MLV .The vials were extensively sonicated until the MLV were reduced in size to yield a clear yellow solution of SUV. The same concentration of nicardipine hydrochloride without the presence of any lipids is insoluble in 5 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5 .
