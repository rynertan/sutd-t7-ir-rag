## Description
ACARICIDALCOMPOSITIONS This invention relates to acaricidal compositions, and to the use of such compositions in the treatment of bedding and other materials. House dust allergies take various forms, including principally asthma, but also skin and eye infections. It has been established by numerous suchors that house dust allergy in a high proportion of cases is caused by the dermatophagoides family of acarine mites and that a beneficial effect cen be expected from the eradication of the mites followed by a prevention of their recurrence.It is well known that the various species of mite, the dermatophagoides family, species culinne, pteronyssinus, the house mite glycyphagus domesticus and the flour mite acarus ciro are relatively non susceptible to normal insecticides such as pyrethrins and D.D.T. They are, however, known to be highly susceptible to certain acaricides such as benzyl benzoate which is widely used in the treatment of scabies and other such infestations. For this purpose, benzyl benzoate has conventionally been emulsified in water, in wich it is insoluble, and the emulsion applied liberally to the patient s skin. The mites in question live and breed largely in bedding materials e.g. sheets, mattresses and blankets, and also house dust, floor coverings, fabric covered furniture. They are also widely found in birds pasts and therefore in feather materials and the skins of birds and manuals, which they also re infect after those materials have been made up into products. It would be useful to treat such bedding and other materials so as either to kill mites coining in contact Tçitl them, or at least to prevent the mites from breeding there.One difficulty in such treatment arises from the fact that benzyl benzoate, though it does not boil until about 320 C, does have an appreciable vapour pressure at am beint temperatures. This vapour pressure is increased at tlle higher temperature taken up by the bedding when the bed is occupied. This also applies to skins and fabric materials etc in warn climates. As a result, benzyl benzoate only gives temporary protection from mites, since in the course of time It evaporates away and is lost. Compositions in which the rate of evaporation cf benzyl benzoate is retarded are described in BritishPatent Specification No. 1,368,657, and include, in addition t the benzyl benzoate, a non volatile poly alkylene glycol or a non volatile etber or esther thereof. Polyethylene glycols having molecular weights Dove 2000 were preferred because they melt above body temper ature and are non sticky and non hygroscopic.It was thought important to avoid using liquid carriers since these would make the bedding feel damp. Suc composiions however have various disadvantages a The polyalkylene glycols a e water soluble and are therefore susceptible to moisture, e.g. from perspir ation in bed. This may cause the glycol derivate, with or without the benzyl benzoate, to migrate, either away from the sleeping patient e.g. downwards into the mattress, or into contact with the patient s clothes and skin. b Since polyalkylene glycols are well known per cutaneous transportation agents, the benzyl benzoate that cores into direct contact with the patient s skin is liable to be adsorbed Into his systen. c Benzyl benzoate and polyethylene glycols, especially those of high molecular weight, are not very soluble one in the other so mixtures are generally two phase systems requiring a co solvent to produce solutions suitable for spraying or dipping. The use of volatile co solvents to achieve solutions cf desired viscosity creates a major problem of toxicity and possibly flammability during manufacturing and or spraying processes. The use of co solvents is also necessary for compositions to be dispersed as aerosols. d Dilution of the active ingredient naturally means that a larder volume of the resulting composition hc.s to be applied to achieve the same acaricidal effect.This is undesirable, both because of the added cost involved, and because the compositions tend, particularly when used in large amounts, to make bedding feel damp. it is an object of the present invention to provide acaricidal compositions in which the rate of evaporation of benzyl benzoate is retarded but which avoid the above mentioned disadvantages. The present invention provides a non aqueous acaricidal composition comprosing benzyl benzoate with from 5 to 900w preferably 5 to 5070, particularly 10 to 25 , by weight on the weight of benzyl benzoate of at least one fatty acid aster miscible with the benzyl benzoate but substantially insoluble in water at 37 C.Suitable fatty acid esters include non volatile natural fixed oils such as soyn oil, corn oil and safflower oil and also other mono , di , and poly esters of monomeric alcohols and anhydrides thereof including glycerol, sorbitol, sorbitan and isopropyl alcohol with fatty acids including myristic, palniltic, stearic oteic and linoleic acids, such as isopropyl myri state. The fatty acid ester may be solid or liquid depending on the requirements. As fatty acid esters of glycerol may be rnentioned derivatives s ch as monopalmitate, monostea rate, distearate and oleate. It is surprising that the rate of evaporisation of benzyl benzoate is considerably slowed down right from the start by the presence of relatively small amounts of the fatty acid ester. The composition nay contain other conventional ingrediens, such as antioxidants and preservatives, in conventional amounts. It was originally feared that the compositions of this invention, if used in the concentrations necessary to kill the mites, could make the bedding feel damp, and would in this respect be inferior to compositions based on polyalkylene glycols. Surprisingly, this has proved not to be the case. The benzyl benzoate and the fatty acid ester appear to act synergistically, so that less benzyl benzoate is required to archieve a given acaricidal effect. Cloth may under some circumstances feel slightly smoother after treatment than before. But there in ne absorption or evaporation of moisture such as causes damp objects tofeel cold.Thus, acaricidal concentrations of benzyl ben zoate can be applied without making sheets or other bedding feel udesilably damp. Indeed the presence of benzyl benzoate may only be detectable by the slight odour. Anti fungal preservatives may be incluted to reduce or eliminate Aspergillus fumigatus, another known cause of asthma. Preferred are hydroxybenzoates, e.g.butyl or benzyl hydroxybenzoate, at a concentr rtion of 0.1 to 2.0 , particulary 0.5 by weight. This is a high level. The fact that the anti fungal preservative level has to be so hight in the generally hydrophobic retaded benzoate compositionsof this invention makes it more surprising that the activity of such compositions against mites is increased b the retarder rather than decreased. The compositions of this invention may be made up in a suitable form tor application. For an aerosol spray, the composition may be dissolved in a volatile solvent and provided with a propellent such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon or fluorocarbon. Alternatively, a retarder may be mixed with the benzyl benzoate and pressurised without the use of a solvent merely by adding a propellent such as dichloro difluoromethane or a mixed propel lent to give the required spray pressure. Alternatively, a direct pressure system such as a collabsible inner container may be used in whitch the propellent provides pressure without actually coming into physical comtact with the sprayed composition. The formulationof an aerosol spray may be accor ding to principales well known in the art. Arternatively, a liquid mixture of a benzoate and retarder may be applied as a spray to a sheet or niattress or other surface by atomisation by mechanical means For a solution into which sheets or other materials may be dipped, the composition of this invention may be dissolved in a volatile solvent, preferably one that is not excessively inflammable, for example chloroform or carbon tetrachloride. The dipped sheets may be dried in a current of warm air. Alternatively the sheets nay bc dipped in a solu tion of benzyl benzoate and a liquid or liquid plus solid retarder such that the resulting sclution is sufficiently fluid to allow immersion of the sheet, followed by removal of excess solution by draining or squeezing through rollers or similar meens tc ensure the required weight of benzyl benzoate solution per unit area of sheet. Compositions of this invention and solutions thereof, which should be non aqueous and sufficiently fluid to be applied to bedding or other materials, preferably consist essentially of 20 to 90 by weight of benzyl benzoate, fror 1 to 45 by weight of fatty acid ester, and from O to 79 by weight of a volatile organic solvent. Solutions of the compositions of this invention may be rendily uniformly applied to bedding or other materials by any convenient tehnique, e.g. spraying or dipping. It may be userful to apply the solution e.g. by calendering or spraying, during manufactre of the mat crial. Mattresses. blankets, sheets and sheepskins are generaly best terated by spreing. IT may be atem to apply the material as a powder by using a hight percen tage of solidifying retarder and dispersing the whole in a suitable powder base such as talc or aerosil sili powder . Treatment may be effected on any material where mites are liable to live or breed. The rate of application deppends more e tent the nature of the nature of the substrate. Sheets treated with r.25 g to 25 g per sq. metre of benzyl benzoate proved lethal to the mits. The application of more than 25 g mê of benzyl benzoate to sheets is unlikely to provide significant added effect and application rates of 5 g mê to 15 g mê are likely to provide an acceptable compromise between cost on the one hand and a period protection on the other. With thicker materials, such as blankets and sheepskins different rates of application will be suitable, while with mattreses a other rates again will apply.The skilled worker wi have no difficulty in determining optimum rates ofapplication of benzyl benzoate in any particular instance, and these will generally be in the range 1 g mê to 50 g mê. The nature of the material to be treated is not critical to the invention. The compositions of the invention arc effective on any of the commonly used i tile materials, e.g. cotton, linen, wool, polyamide and polyester. lt appears that mites are only killed physic contact with liquid or solid benzyl bezoate, and not by contact with the vapour. It is therefore desirable to effect removal of at least the bulk of the nite infestation before applying the compositions of this invention to the bedding. The application of benzyl benzoate to infested bedding is of limited use, particularly as the mites are capable of causing asthma irrespective of whether they are al.ive or dead. According to preferred procedure, therefore, the live and dead mites are removed from the patient s bed and bedding by taking all movable items such as sheets and blankets and washing them very thoroughly in a normal washing machine. The pillow is preferentially changed for a foam or terylene pillow to avoid a concentration of dust mites being inside the feathers of a feather pillow and the mattress and the surrounds n areas are thoroughly cleaned with a vacuum cleaner, care being taken particularly with the areas under mattress buttons and dozen seams. Once this has been done, either the mattress or a piece of sheet which is placed over the mattress is sprayed with the contents of an aerosol can or hand spray container, or an impregnated sheet is placed over the mattress. Clinical tests with the benzyl benzoate treated bedding in the presence of the retarder have shown patient acceptability to be extremely good. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples, in which par are by weight.

The compositions tested were A. Pure benzyl benzoate. B. 10 parts benzyl benzoate 2 parts glyceryl mono disearate. C. 10 parts benzyl benzoate 2 parts isopropyl myristate. Tests were carried out with the mite Dermato phagoides farinae fron a laboratory colony. The mites were maintained on finely ground dog food and kept under optimal conditions at 250C and 80 relative hllmiuit.y. The techniques used are described by Heller Haupt and Busvine J. Med. Ent. 1974 11, 551 558 The tree compositions ere tested over a range of 8 rates. The mortality was read after 24 hours exposure. Mortalities where plotted against log deposit rates and analyses by probit analyses using a CDC 7600 computer. The results obtained were as follows Composition LD99.9 mg m mites per dose A 260 30 261 B 217 20 225 C 242 30 223 The LD99.9 figure is the dose required to kill 99.9 of the mites under specified conditions the lower the figure, the more lethal the composition. It is striking that compositions B and C where both more lethal than pure benzyl benzoate, despite each containing only 83 of benzyl benzoate.
