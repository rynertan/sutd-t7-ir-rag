# Electrical connectors with protective hood.

## Abstract
A protective hood for a rectangular electrical connector is described in which the hood is provided with flexible sidewalls. A locking member and cam member is provided adjacent the free edge of each sidewall near the opening to the recess in the hood into which the connector is positioned. During assembly of the hood to the connector, the cam members flex the sidewalls away from the connector to prevent the locking members from locking onto the connec tor. When fully assembled, the cam members release the sidewalls to allow the locking members to lock onto the connector with an audible snap . The hood may be unlocked and removed from the connector by manually flexing the hood sidewalls away from the connector. In one form of the invention this may be done by manually applying force to one end of the bottom of the hood.
