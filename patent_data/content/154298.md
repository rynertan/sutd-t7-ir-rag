TREATMENT OF DIARRHOEAThe present invention relates to the treatment of diarrhoea using a class of pentacyclic compounds and to pharmaceutical formulations for use in such treatment.European Published Patent Application No. 0088575 describes compounds of formula I below and N oxides and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, together with their use in the treatment of CNS disorders such as depression and anxiety. It has now surprisingly been found that compounds of formula I and certain derivatives thereof are also useful in protecting young animals from death due to neonatal scours and in the treatment of scours and diarrhoea.Accordingly the present invention provides a method for treatment or preventing diarrhoea or scours which comprises administering to a human or non human animal in need thereof an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I EMI1.1 or an N oxide or pharmaceutically acceptable quaternised derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1 7 alkyl, C37 cycloalkyl, C47 cycloalkenyl or C1 4 alkyl substituted by C2 7 alkenyl, C2 7 alkynyl, C37 cycoalkyl, hydroxy, this, C1 4 alkoxy, C14 alkylthio, carboxy, C1 4 alkoxycarbonyl, C14 alkanoyl, amino optionally substituted by one or two C1 4 alkyl or by C4 6 polymethylene optionally containing an oxygen or nitrogen atom, aminocarbonyl optionally N substituted by one or two C1 4 alkyl, or benzoyl or phenyl either being optionally ring substituted by C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, halogen or trifluoromethyl, R2 and R3 are the same or different and are hydrogen, hydroxy, C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, C14 alkylthio, halogen or trifluoromethyl, m is 1 to 3 and n is 1 or 2, the hydrogen atom bonded to the Ca carbon atom being trans to the hydrogen atom bonded to the Cb carbon atom.Within the definition for R1 is a sub group, wherein R1 is hydrogen, C14 alkyl, C14 alkyl substituted by amino optionally substituted by one or two C1 4 alkyl or by C4 6 polymethylene optionally containing an oxygen or nitrogen atom, or C1 4 alkyl substituted by phenyl optionally substituted by C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, halogen or trifluoromethyl.When R1 is C1 4 alkyl substituted by phenyl optionally substituted as hereinbefore defined, examples of such optional substituents include methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy, fluoro, chloro, bromo or trifluoromethyl.Preferably, phenyl is unsubstituted.When R1 is C1 4 alkyl substituted by amino optionally substituted as hereinbefore defined, examples of such optional substituents include methyl and ethyl and, together with the nitrogen atom, piperidino and morpholino. Preferably, R1 is hydrogen or C14 alkyl, in particular C14 alkyl, such as methyl and ethyl.Within the definition for R2 and R3 is a sub group, wherein R2 and R3 are the same or different and are hydrogen, C14 alkyl, C14 alkoxy, halogen or trifluoromethyl.Preferred examples for R2 and R3 are hydrogen, hydroxy, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy, bromo, chloro, fluoro and trifluoromethyl. Preferably, R2 is hydrogen, methoxy, hydroxy, methyl or chloro and R3 is hydrogen. Preferably, m is 1 or 2. Preferably, n is 1.The compounds of the invention have chiral centres at the Ca and Cb carbon atoms and therefore can exist in enantiomeric forms. The present invention extends to such enantiomers individually and as mixtures including racemates.Particularly preferred compounds within formula I are the compounds of the examples described hereinafter, or an N oxide or pharmaceutically acceptable quaternised derivative or salt thereof. The most preferred compound of formula I is trans 12 methyl l,l0,11,12,12a, 12b hexahydro 5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cyclohepta l, 2, 3,4 defzfluorene, which is the compound prepared inExample 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable quaternised derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Cuaternised derivatives of compounds of formula I are novel and as such forms part of the invention.Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable quaternised derivatives are the quaternary ammonium salts in particular those compounds quaternised by compounds such as R4 Q wherein R4 is optionally substituted C1 6 alkyl, phenyl C1 6 alkyl or Cg 7 cycloalkyl, and Q is a radical corresponding to a anion of an acid. Suitable examples of R5 include methyl, ethyl and n and iso propyl and benzyl and phenethyl. Suitable Q include halide such as chloride, bromide and iodide.Suitable substitutents for R4 include hydroxy.A preferred group of compounds of the present invention are compounds of formula 11 EMI4.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined in relation to compounds of formula I R5 is C16 alkyl which may optionally be substituted and Z is a veterinarily or pharmaceutically acceptable anion. Preferred groups R4 include methyl, ethyl and hydroxyethyl.Suitable veterinarily or pharmaceutically acceptable anions include halide ions of which iodide is preferred.Preferred compounds of formula II include these wherein one or both R2 and R3 are hydrogen.More preferred compounds of formula II are those wherein R1 is methyl and m is 2.An N oxide of a compound of formula I includes the oxide of either nitrogen atom shown in formula I and the oxide of any nitrogen containing substituent for Rl. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula I includes an acid addition salt of either nitrogen atom shown in formula I and of any nitrogencontaining substituent for R1, the acid addition salt being derived from a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, maleic acid, citric acid and acetic acid. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula I also includes alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts of any carboxy containing substituent for R1. Examples of such salts include potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium salts.Compounds of formula I and N oxides and pharmaceutically acceptable quaternised derivatives and salts thereof protect animals from the lethal consequences of enterotoxigenic E.coli infections and are therefore useful in the treatment of hypersecretory diarrhoea and scours.As used herein pharmaceutically acceptable means suitable for administration to human or non human animals.The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment or prevention of diarrhoea or scours, which composition comprises a compound of formula I or an N oxide or pharmaceutically acceptable quaternised derivative or salt thereof hereinafter referred to as the drug and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a quaternised derivative of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. Yet further according to the present invention there is provided the use of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of diarrhoea or scours.Pharmaceutical compositions of the drug will, of course, be adapted for administration to the humans or animals to be treated. Thus, for example, the composition may be a shaped composition, such as a bolus, tablet or capsule. In such cases the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier will be chosen from the usual range of lubricants, dispersants, binders, fillers and the like. When these shaped compositions are for administration to cattle and pigs often they will weigh at least 1 g, on occasions at least 2 g. For administration to humans, especially children, the drug may suitably be presented as a syrup including suitable colouring and or flavouring agents. Such syrups are conveniently presented in unit or multi dose containers.For veterinary use the composition may also be a dispersion or a solution of the drug in a suitable vehicle for use with an oral doser this is a well known item of farm equipment, basically comprising a liquid reservoir, a mouthpiece adapted for insertion into animals mouths, and a pump mechanism whereby unit doses can be ejected form the reservoir through the mouthpiece . Conveniently the drug may be administered from an oral doser as an aqueous solution.Alternatively, the vehicle will be an oil or water based cream to ensure homogeneity of the unit doses administered.The invention, therefore, also provides an oral doser containing a multi dose of the drug in a veterinarily acceptable vehicle.The drugs of the invention may also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. Thus the invention also provides animal feed or animal drinking water containing a compound of formula I . It will be convenient to formulate these animal feed and drinking water compositions with a multi dose of the drug so that the animal takes in an appropriate quantity of the drug along with its diet. It will also be convenient to present the composition of the invention as a pre mix for addition to the feed or drinking water. With human babies or young animals, a particularly useful technique is to blend their milk with the drugs of this invention.The compositions of the invention may also be formulated for injection. In such cases the drug chosen is suitably dissolved in water for injection.Often it will be appropriate to include in the compositions a further medicine such as an antibacterial agent for example an antibiotic such as a p lactam antibiotic, for example amoxycillin or ampicillin, or neomycin or a sulphonamide such as sulfadoxin, an agent to alter intestinal motility such as loperamide or an agent to modify stool consistency such as pectin.Treatment of diarrhoea and scours using the drug may be supplemented by oral rehydration therapy such as those described in U.K. Patent No. 1,581,826 and GermanOffenlegungsschrift No. 28 54 281, UK PatentApplication No. 2 012 163A, US Patent No. 3 898 328,Nalin, D.R. and Cash, R.A., Bull. World Health Org., 43, 361 1970 , French Patent No. 2 467 599, UK PatentNo. 1 465 308 and as described in SecretoryDiarrhoea , Ed M. Field, J.S. Fordtran and S,G,Schultz, American Physiological Society, Maryland, 1980 pp 179of85 and Lancet, 1975 pp 79 and 80.Conveniently the drug may be administered with the oral rehydration formulation. Alternatively it may be provided separately and administered simultaneously or sequentially with the oral rehydration formulation.The amount of drug administered must, of course, be sufficient to bring about the desired effect and will also depend on the body weight of the recipient and the chosen route of administration. Suitably the drug is administered at from 1Og kg to 100mg kg, preferably 10pg kg to 10mg kg. Thus, by way of example, useful dosage units of the composition for treating diarrhoea may contain 5 ug to 500 mg of the drug. Of course, it will be appreciated that many preferred compositions of the invention are in multi dose form as, for the therapy of animals, it is often most desirable to be able rapidly to treat a number of animals. Such multi dose compositions will contain, by way of example, at least 1 mg of the drug.Depending on the exact nature of the said multi dose composition, often it will contain at least 50 mg of the drug, and on occasions as much as 1 g. Doses may be administered once or several times daily.Compounds of formula I or an N oxide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be produced by any of the processes described in EuropeanPublished Patent Application No. 0088575.Suitably N oxides are produced by treating the compound of formula I with an oxidising agent, such as hydrogen peroxide, in a suitable solvent, such as methanol, at elevated temperature.Quaternised derivatives of compounds of formula I may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula I with a conventional reagent for quaternising from a secondary or tertiary amine, such as the appropriate alkyl, aryl or aralkyl chloride, bromide or iodide.This reaction may be carried out in a solvent, such as acetone, methanol, ethanol, nitromethene, dimethylformamide, at ambient or elevated temperature with or without pressure. For example a compound of formula II , as hereinbefore defined is prepared by treating the appropriate compound of formula I with a compound of formula III R5 Z III wherein R5 and Z are as hereinbefore defined in suitable solvent such as nitromethane at elevated temperature and under an inert atmosphere.Suitable compounds for use in the invention are selected from trans 12 methyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12b hexahydro 5H 9b,12diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans 13 methyl 1,2,6,11,12,13,13a,13b octahydro lOb, 13 diazabenzoCgh7pleidene trans 7 methoxy 12 methyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12b hexahydro5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2, 3,4 def fluorene trans 7,12 dimethyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12b hexahydro 5H 9b, 12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans 8 chloro 12 methyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12b hexahydro5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans 7 hydroxy 12 methyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12b hexahydro5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans 1,10,11,12,12a,12b hexahydro 5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans l2 benzyl 1, 10,11,12, 12a, 12b hexahydro 5H 9b, 12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans 12 prop 2 enyl 1,10,11,12, 12a, 12b hexahydro 5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans 12 prop 2 ynyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12b hexahydro 5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene and trans 12 2 hydroxyethyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12bhexahydro SH 9b,l2 diazabenzoC5,6lcyclohepta E1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans 12 2 methoxyethyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12bhexahydro 5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3, 4 def fluorene trans 12 ethyl l, 10,11,12, 12a, 12b hexahydro 5H Sb, 12 di azabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans 12 cyclohexylmethyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12b hexahydro5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cyclohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans 12 3 oxobutyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12b hexahydro 5H Sb,l2 diazabenzoE5,6 cycloheptaEl,2, 3,4 def fluorene trans 12 2 ethoxycarbonylethyl 1,10,11,12,12a, 12b hexahydro 5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene trans 12 2 dimethylaminoethyl 1,10,11,12,12a,12bhexahydro 5H 9b,12 diazabenzo 5,6 cycohepta 1,2,3,4 def fluorene or an N oxide or pharmaceutically acceptable quaternised derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.or an N oxide or a pharmaceutically acceptable quarternised derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof Suitable quaternised salts of the invention include 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 14b, hexahydro 2,2 dimethyl l, 14 methanodibenz Ec,g pyrazinium 1,2 a azepine halide 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 14b Hexahydro 2, 2 dimethyl l, 14 methanodibenzo Ec, f pyrazinium tl,2 a azepine halide and 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 14b hexahydro 2 2 hydroxymethyl 2 methyldibenzo c,f pyrazinium El,2 a azelpine halide.
