# Engine cooling systems.

## Abstract
Cooling system, particularly for vehicle engines, in cludes a coolant circulation pump 21 and a cooling fan 20 typically coacting with a radiator 14 both driven by a common variable speed motor 18 whereby both the pump and fan can be operated at lower and higher speeds in response to the sensed temperature levels of the coolant.
