# Electromagnetic shielding means for an electrical connector.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic energy shielding means for receipt between slidingly interengaging electrically conductive walls of mating electrical connector parts characterised by a first helically wound electrically conductive coil spring 21 arranged in a continuous closed path a second helically wound coil spring 22 arranged in a continuous closed path, said second coil spring contacting the first coil spring at crossover points 23 and being conductively bonded to the first coil spring at the crossover points.
