## Description
CA RBOX YLIC SULFONIC POLYALK YLENE OXIDE POLYMERS FOR USE AS SCALE AND CORROSION INHIBITORS AND IN CONTROLLING DEPOSITS OF IRON OXIDE Most industrial waters contain alkaline earth metal cations, such as those of calcium, barium and magnesium, and several anions such as bicarbonate, carbonate, sulfate, oxalate, phosphate, silicate and fluoride.When combinations of these anions and cations are present in concentrations that cause the solubility products of the corresponding salts to be exceeded, precipitates form until these concentrations are no longer exceeded. For example, when the concentrations of calcium ion and carbonate ion are such that the solubility product of calcium carbonate is exceeded, a solid phase of calcium carbonate will form. Solubility product concentrations are exceeded for various reasons, such as partial evaporation of the water phase, change in pH, pressure or temperature, and the introduction of additional ions that form insoluble compounds with the ions already present in the solution. As these reaction products are precipitated on surfaces of the watercarrying system, they accumulate as scale or deposits. This accumulation prevents effective heat transfer, interferes with fluid flow, facilitates corrosive processes, and harbours bacteria. Scale is an expensive problem in many industrial water systems causing delays and shutdowns for cleaning and removaL The precipitation of scale forming compounds can be prevented by inactivating their cations with chelating or sequestering agents, so that the solubility product is not exceeded. Generally, this requires large quantities of chelating or sequestering agent as cation, since chelation is a stoichiometric reaction, and these amounts are not always desirable or economical. Almost 50 years ago, it was discovered that certain inorganic polyphosphates would prevent such precipitation when added in amounts far less than the concentrations needed for sequestering or chelating. The term polyphosphates means phosphates having a molar ratio of metal oxide P205 in the range from 1 1 to 2 1. When a precipitation inhibitor is present in a potentially scaleforming system at a markedly lower concentration than that required for stoichiometric binding of the scale forming cation, it is said to be present in threshold amounts. See for example, Hatch and Rice, IndustrialEngineering Chemistry , Vol. 31, pages 51 to 53 Jan. 1939 Reitemeier andBuehrer, Journal of Physical Chemistry , VoL 44, No. 5, pages 535 to 536 May 1940 and US Patent Specifications US A 2,353,222 and 2,539,305. Usually, sequestering takes place at a weight ratio of threshold active compound to scale forming cation components of greater than 10 1, depending on the anion components in the water. Threshold inhibition generally takes place at a weight ratio of threshold active compound to scale forming cation components of less than 0.5 1.0. Certain water soluble polymers, including groups derived from acrylamide and acrylic acid, have been used to condition water containing scale forming compounds. As for example, see U.S. Patent Specifications US A 2,783,200 3,514,476 2,980,610 3,285,886 3,463,730 and 3,513,204. U.S. Patent Specification US A 3,928,196 discloses the use of a copolymer of 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropylsulfonic acid and acrylic acid in inhibiting scale. Japanese Patent Specifications S8 149911 and 58 147413 disclose the use carboxyllclpolyalkylene oxide copolymers as pigment dispersants.Pendant alkylene oxide chains may be capped with sulfonic acid groups. Japanese Patent 57 84794 discloses the use of copolymers of acrylic acid and allyl polyethylene glycol as scale inhibitors.

The invention also provides a water soluble polymer having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.05 to 2.3 dl g prepared from a 35 to 90 by weight of an unsaturated carboxylic compound that is acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, a salt of such an acid or a mixture of two or more such compounds b 5 to 40 by weight of an unsaturated sulfonic compound that is 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropylsulfonic acid, 2 methacrylamido 2 methylpropylsulfonic acid, methallylsulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, vinylsulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic acid a salt of such an acid or a mixture of two or more such compounds and c 5 to 40 by weight of an unsaturated polyalkylene oxide compound.

EXAMPLES The following abbreviations are used in the examples and are defined as indicated AA is acrylic acid,AMPS is 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropylsulfonic acid, andAllyl PEG is CH2 CH2 CH2 OCH2CH2 nOH and Methoxy Allyl PEG is CH2 CH CH2 OCH2CH2 nOCH3, where n is 5 to 10, particularly 7 in Allyl PEG. PolymerizationSynthesis of Allyl Ether of Methoxy Polyethylene Glycol Methoxy PEG Carbowax 8 350 was reacted with an excess of allyl bromide added slowly in the presence of sodium hydroxide. The unreacted allyl bromide and water were then distilled off at a reduced pressure. NaBr was precipitated and filtered off. The monomer solution was diluted with methanol, then neutralized with concentrated HCI. Methanol and water were removed by rotary evaporation at 70 C. A clear light brown solution was obtained after filtration. The resultant allyl ether structure of the product was confirmed by IR and NMR. An equimolar concentration of methoxy group and alkyl group was observed. Synthesis of Polymers Methoxy allyl PEG and water were added in the reactor as a heel and heated to 800C. A 38 sodium acrylate solution and an ammonium per sulfate APS solution and a sodium metabisulfite solution were fed in over 2 hours. The final polymer solution had 30 solids. For the preparation ofAA AMPS Methoxy Allyl PEG terpolymer, the only modification was to add NaAMPS solution into the monomer mix and feed it in. Intrinsic viscosities were measured in 1 M NaCl in a size 75 Cannon Ubbelohde capillary viscometer. Measurements at 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 g dl were taken. The Huggins equation was used to determine the intrinsic viscosity. Composition Wt.
