# A process of etching aluminium anode foil for high voltage electrolytic capacitors.

## Abstract
Aluminium electrolytic capacitor anode foil of a high cubic texture etched in two step process by treating the foil in an electrolyte bath containing 3 hydrochloric acid and 1 aluminium as aluminium chloride under the influence of a direct current and at a temperature of 75 C, and in a second step treating said etched foil in an aqueous bath of 8 nitric acid and 2.6 aluminium as a nitrate at a temperature of 85 C for 5 to 7 minutes. The foil thus etched has a significantly higher capacitance resulting from a greater density of tunnels, an elongation of the tunnels, and a faily linear tunnel structure.
