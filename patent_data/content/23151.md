# Composite ice confections and processes for preparing them.

## Abstract
A composite frozen confection comprising ice confection in contact with a layer of fat based confectionery composition comprising a suspension of flavouring and sweetening solids in a fat base, for example arranged to separate the ice confec tion from a dry edible confection such as wafer, characterised in that the fat base essentially includes a fat composition having a solids content index SCI values as defined below , in each of the following ranges 70 93 at 20 C, preferably 75 90 65 93 at 10 C preferably 75 85 55 90 at 0 C, preferably 65 75 15 40 at 20 C 0 12 at 30 C 0 at 40 C. b slip melting point in the range 25 45 C e.g. 25 36 C c viscosity when measured at 40 C corresponding to
