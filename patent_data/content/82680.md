# Riveting machine.

## Abstract
An automatic drilling and riveting machine 10 comprising a frame having a main body portion 12 and having a front end portion 14 disposed in a first plane, means for defining a drilling and riveting axis 40 in the frame closely adjacent and substantially parallel to the first plane, and a ram and clamp assembly 44 carried by the frame for holding a workpiece W relative to the frame in a second plane substantially perpendicular to the first plane during drilling and riveting and for applying force for heading a rivet inserted in the workpiece. A transfer assembly 380 carried by the frame main body portion selectively moves a drilling means 240 and a rivet inserting and forming means 300 each into and out of positional alignment with the drilling and riveting axis and when in such alignment toward and away from the workpiece for drilling a rivet receiving hole in the workpiece and for inserting a rivet in the hole and forming a head on the inserted rivet in co operation with the holding and force applying means. A rivet receivng and holding means 570,596 receives rivet blanks from a supply tube 568 and maintains them in a predetermined orientation for subsequent injection into the rivet inserting and forming means independent of the orientation of the machine.
