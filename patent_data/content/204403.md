# DYEING BY ELECTROSTATIC APPLICATION OF RANDOMLY GENERATED DROPLETS

## Abstract
Uniform application of a controlled relatively small liquid volume per unit area to a moving fabric substrate is obtained even though application is made using a liquid jet electrosta tic applicator which employs random drop formation proces ses. Repetitive print times during which randomly formed droplets are passed onto the substrate along a linear orifice array are controlled so as to have a minimum duration suffi ciently large as to average out expected random variation in droplet formation processes occurring along the orifice array. At the same time, the center to center spacing of each printed pixel during which randomly formed droplets are intercepted so as not to fall onto the substrate is controlled so as to maintain a desired relatively small controlled liquid volume per unit area within the fabric substrate section to be printed. In one exemplary embodiment, the print times are maintained in excess of approximately 200 microseconds and or so as to insure that the expected standard deviation of liquid volume printed onto the substrate during each print time is less than approximately 0.2.
