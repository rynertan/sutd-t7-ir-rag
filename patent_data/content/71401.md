# A curved mold for continuous casting.

## Abstract
Conventionally, in a continuous casting machine, in which a curved mold is used, a bent strand is formed and is then straightened at a single straightening point or in a multi point straightening zone. Since the vertical cooling water channels are formed in the long sided mold sections of a conventional curved mold, the distance Δℓ between the vertical cooling water channels and the curved inner sur faces varies in the casting direction, with the result that breakout is likely to occur due to a nonuniform temperature distribution over the curved inner surfaces. According to the present invention, the longitudinal cooling water channels 19f, 19ℓ, 26f, and 26ℓ extend virtually in accordance with the curved inner surfaces 9f, 9ℓ as seen in the vertical direction of the curved mold, thereby maintaining the temperature of the entire inner surface of the curved mold at 400 C or less and effectively preventing breakout.

## Description
A CURVED MOLD FOR CONTINUOUS CASTING The present invention relates to a curved mold for continuous casting which comprises both short sided mold sections and long sided mold sections, the inner surface of each of the long sided mold sections being curved as seen in the vertical direction of the curved mold. A curved mold for continuous casting which is installed in a known continuous casting machine CCM is water cooled, and the curve of each of the long sided mold sections as seen in the vertical direction of the curved mold has a radius R of from approximately 10.5 to 12.5 meters, the center of the radius R being on a horizontal line extending across a substantially central portion of the curved mold as seen in a vertical direction. The inner surface of each of the long sided mold sections is here in after referred to as the curved inner surface. Molten steel is supplied into a curved mold and is primary cooled by cooling water which flows through the cooling water channels of the curved mold.While a strand not yet completely solidifed, and thus having a thin shell is guided until it arrives at a straightening point at the straightening point, the strand, which is bent, is straightened, or unbent, horizontally, and draws a quarter of a circle having a radius defined by each of the radii of the curved inner surface of each of the long sided mold sections. The strand is then guided in a horizontal direction. Known curved type continuous casting machines and a known curved mold for continuous casting are described with reference to Figs. 1 through 4. In the drawings Figures 1 and 2 illustrate known curved type continuous casting machines Fig. 3 is a vertical cross sectional view of the long sided mold sections of a known curved. mold for continuous casting Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view along line IV IV ofFig. 3 Fig. 5 is a graph indicating the relationship between the radius R of the curved inner surface of each of the long sided mold sections and a nonuniform temperature distribution over the curved inner surfaces in the vertical direction of the curved mold, i.e., the maximum temperature difference of the curved inner surface of each of the long sided mold sections mentioned above as seen in the casting direction Figs. 6 and 7 are cross sectional views of a curved mold for continuous casting according to an embodiment of the present invention, and Figs. 8 and 9 are drawings similar to Figs. 6 and 7 regarding other embodiments. In Fig. 1, a curved mold for continuous casting 1, hereinafter simply referred to as the curved mold 1, comprises the long sided mold sections la. Each of the long sided mold sections la has a curved inner surface with a radius R of from approximately 10.5 to 12 meters. A horizontal line extending across a substantially central portion of the curved mold 1 as seen in the vertical direction is denoted by RL. The center O of the radius R of each curved inner surface is on the horizontal line HL. Strand 2 is guided along a quarter of the circle of the strand s path and is subsequently straightened or is horizontally unbent at the straightening point 3. Since there is only one straightening point 3 in known curved type continuous casting machine 4 illustrated in Fig. 1, the machine height is very high.Curved type continuous casting machine 4, hereinafter referred to as a high headCCM, is conventionally used for the continuous casting of slabs. Recently, attempts have been made to decrease the machine height of a high head CCM 4 and thus decrease the construction costs. Such attempts are disclosed inJapanese Laid open Patent Application Nos. 56 14062, 56 14063, 56 14064, and 56 14065 to981 . More specifically, in these attempts, low head CCM 17 illustrated in Fig. 2 comprises multi point straightening zone 15, which consists of five pairs of straightening rolls P1 , P2 ,P3 t P4 and P5 defining radii R1 , R2 8R3 , R4 and R5 , respective ly. The basic radius R1 of the curve is 5.8 meters and the machine height H which is slightly less than 6 meters.The basic radius R1 of the curve of strand s path is defined by the long sided mold sections 16a. Namely, the curved inner surface of each of the long sided mold sections 16a defines a small basic radius of the curve of the strand s path, e.g., 5.8 meters, the center o of the curve being on horizontal line HL which extends across a substantially central portion of the long sided mold sections 16a as seen in the vertical direction of the curved mold. In Figs. 3 and 4, the long sided mold sections la of curved mold 1 Fig. 1 installed in high head CCM 4 Fig. 1 are shown, but the short sided mold sections of a curved mold 1 are not shown. The long sided mold sections at the fixed side and the loose side of the strand are denoted by Sf and 5Q, respectively. The fixed side and the loose side correspond to the outer side and the inner side of the curve of the curved mold 1, respectively. The long sided mold sections 5f and 5Q comprise copper plates 7f and 7Q having curved inner surfaces 9Q and 9f, respectively.Cooling water boxes 6Q and 6f, which consist of upper and lower cooling chambers, are attached to the outer surface of the copper plate 7f and copper plate 7 , respectively, by means of the bolts 8 Fig. 4 or the like. The curved inner surface of the long sided mold section Sf and the curved inner surface of long sided mold section 5Q are defined by the curved inner surface 9Q and curved inner surface 9f of copper plates 7f and 7 , respectively.The curve of the curved front surface 9f and the curved inner surface of 9Q have radius Rf and radius Rg , respectively, while the curve of curved inner surface 9f at the fixed side of the strand has radius Rf The center of each of these curves is on a horizontal line not shown which extends across a substantially central portion curved mold 1 as seen in the vertical direction. Radius RQ is from approximately 10.5 to 12 meters. For the sake of simplicity, the descriptions hereinunder relate only to the long sided mold section Sf at the fixed side of the strand otherwise specified. However, they also correspond to the long sided mold section 5Q at the loose side of the strand. Vertical cooling water channel 10f is formed in copper plate 7f while lateral cooling water channels llf, which connect the vertical cooling water channels 10f with the cooling water box 6f, are formed in the upper and lower parts of the copper plate 7f. A vapor withdrawing aperture 12f extends between the top surface of copper plate 7f and the lateral cooling water channels llf. Although not shown in Fig. 3, a number of vertical and lateral cooling water channels 10f and lif and vapor withdrawing apertures are formed in each long sided mold section and are arranged in the long width direction of the strand. In the curved mold 1 of high head CCM 4 Fig. 1 , the vertical and lateral cooling water channels 10f and llf, respectively, are defined by a first copper plate section 14f and a second copper plate section 13f, second copper plate section 13f being grooved and having a recess in which the first copper plate section 14f is capable of being embedded. When forming the vertical and lateral cooling water channels 10f and llf, first copper plate section 14f is inserted into the recess of the second copper plate section 13f and then the first copper plate section 14f is engaged with the grooved surface of the second copper plate section 13f. In a high head CCM 4 Fig. 1 provided with a curved mold 1 shown in Figs. 3 and 4, breakout intermittently takes place during the continuous casting of a strand that is the strand 8 shell, formed in curved mold 1, breaks and molten steel flows out of the strand, damaging the high head CCM 4 and decreasing productivity. When high speed continuous casting high speed withdrawal of the strand is carried out in low head CCM 17 Fig. 2 at a casting speed of 1 meter min or higher, breakout is more liable to occur than in a high head CCM 4 Fig. 1 . It is an object of the present invention to provide a water cooling structure for the long sided mold sections of a curved mold so as to suppress breakout and realize high speed continuous casting, especially in a low head CCM. The present inventors studied the phenomenon of breakout, which especially occurs in high speed continuous casting at a casting speed of 1 meter min or higher. As a result, the present inventors recognized that half or more than half of the incidents of breakout in high speed continuous casting occurs due to the strands shell sticking to the inner surface of curved mold 1 or 16.Also, the present inventors discovered that in order to prevent the strand s shell from sticking to the inner surface of the curved mold 1 or 16, curved mold 1 or 16 should be designed in such a manner that the temperature of the entire inner surface of curved mold 1 or 16 is maintained at 4000C or less. A curved mold for continuous casting comprising short sided mold sections and long sided mold sections each having a curved inner surface as seen in the vertical direction thereof according to the present invention is characterized in that logitudinal cooling water channels of the long sided mold sections extend in a direction virtually in accordance with the curve of the inner surface of each of the long sided mold sections as seen in the vertical direction thereof. The studies of the present inventors, which were conducted before completing the curved mold according to the present invention, are now described. The present inventors examined the cooling construction of the copper plate for a curved mold 1 Figs. 1 and 3 , which is employed in a high head CCM 4 Fig. 1 , and concluded the following 1. The curved inner surface of the long sided mold section 5f, namely curved inner surface 9f of curved mold 1, is a concavely curved surface having the radius Rf while the curved inner surface of long sided mold section 5Q, namely curved inner surface 9Q of the curved mold 1, is a convexly curved surface having the radius Rg. Since the vertical cooling water channels 10f and 10Q extend through the long sided mold sections Sf and SQ, respectively, in the vertical direction of curved mold 1 distance AQ hereinafter simply referred to as distance A , between the vertical water cooling channels 10f and 10Q and the curved inner surfaces 9f and 9Q, respectively, varies in the vertical direction of the curved mold 1.For example, in a conventional curved mold, in which the radius Rf of the curved inner surface 9f is specifically 10.5 meters, the height of the curved mold is 700 mm, and the center of the curve having radius Rf is on a horizontal line extending across a portion of the curved mold 350 mm below the top of the curved mold, minimum distance EQ being determined as being 30 mm in the light of the life of the curved mold. In this case, the maximum value of distance At amounts to 36 mm, with the result that distance EQ varies by 6 mm. In other words, the thickness of the second copper plate section 13f varies by 6 mm in the vertical direction of the curved mold.In a case where the difference between the maximum and minimum values of distance max tZmin in the vertical direction of the curved mold is 6 mm, such difference ALmax results in the overall thermal conductivity of primary cooling varying in the casting direction.More specifically, primary cooling, which is determined according to the thermal conductivity of the strand s shell, the second copper plate section 13 , and the vertical cooling water channel 10 , varies in the vertical direction of the curved mold, and the difference in the overall thermal conductivity corresponds to from 1 to 5 , with the result that the temperature of the curved inner surface 9f varies by 250C at the maximum as seen in the vertical direction of the curved mold. In other words, the temperature distribution of the curved inner surface 9f is nonuniform in the casting direction. 2. In a conventional curved mold having radius Rf 1 distance EQ, and the height specified in item 1 above, the temperature of the curved inner surface 9f varies during continuous casting but difference AL max EQ mentioned above is maintained. In the case of high speed continuous casting, said temperature varies between 3500C and 4200C specifically at a portion of long sided mold section 5Q where difference AL is maximal.Incidentally, the heat resistance of the vertical cooling water channel 10f is approximately 5 of the overall heat resistance of the strand s shell, copper plate section, and vertical cooling water channel 10f, with the result that even by enhancing the cooling water flow rate in the vertical cooling water channel 10f, the temperature of the curved inner surface 9f cannot be lowered. When this temperature exceeds 4000 C, breakout may occur. The present inventors further considered the case of low head CCM 17 in regard to how the radius of the curved inner surface of the mold exerts an influence on the nonuniform temperature distribution curved inner surface 9f.The present applicant has already proposed a low head CCM such as that shown in Fig. 2 so as to obtain strands having a high temperature and being free of defects. In accordance with a decrease in machine height, the radius of the curved inner surface of the curved mold inevitably decreased, with the result that the nonuniform temperature distribution of the curved inner surface becomes more serious.More specifically, as shown in Fig. 5, which indicates the relationship between the basic radius R of the strand 8 path and the nonuniform temperature distribution in the vertical direction of the curved mold in centigrade that is, the maximum temperature difference of the curved inner surface as seen in the casting direction, hereinafter simply referred to as the maximum temperature difference , such nonuniform temperature or the maximum temperature difference is increased in accordance with the basic radius R of the curve of the strand s path. Especially, when the basic radius R of the curve of the strand s path is 6 meters or less, said nonuniform temperature distribution or the maximum temperature difference amounts to 400C or more. The present inventors further examined whether a decrease in the thickness of copper plate 7f, that is, a decrease in the heat resistance of the copper plate 7f, would make it possible to decrease the temperature of a portion of the curved inner surface 9f where the thickness of copper plate 7f is the greatest to a value of 4000C or less and thus effectively prevent breakout. In such a case, minimum distance Admin becomes 30 mm or less, thereby creating problem in the light of the life of curved mold 1.When the life of a curved mold is short in continuous casting, productivity is decreased and the cost of producing strands is increased. After considering the above mentioned points, the present invention was completed. According to the present invention, vertical cooling water channels in the long sided mold sections extend in a longitudinal direction virtually in accordance with the curve of the inner surface of each of the long sided mold sections as seen in the vertical direction of the curved mold, thereby maintaining the temperature of the entire inner surface of the curved mold at 4000C or less and effectively preventing breakout due to the strand s shell sticking to the inner surface of the curved mold, while at the same time not decreasing the life of the curved mold.Therefore, according to the curved mold of the present invention, high speed continuous casting at a casting speed of especially from 1.4 to 2.0 meters min is possible while effectively preventing breakout and prolonging the life of the curved mold so that it is equivalent to or longer than that of a conventional curved mold. In Fig. 6, an embodiment of the curved mold according to the present invention is illustrated. In the figure, the curved mold is denoted by 18, and the vertical cross sectional structure of the long sided mold sections SQ and Sf having the curved inner surfaces 9Q and 9f, respectively, is shown but the known vertical cross sectional structure of the short sided mold sections is not shown. Curved cooling water channels 19f and l9Q are formed in the long sided mold sections Sf and SQ, respectively, in such a manner that they are delineated by a single curve.More specifically, in the curved cooling water channel l9f, which is formed in the long sided mold section Sf, the radius of the curve is Rf AL while in the curved cooling water channel l9Q, which is formed in the long sided mold section 5 , the radius of the curve is RQ EQ. Distance AQ, which indicates the distance between the cooling water channels l9f and l9Q and the curved inner surfaces 9f, 9 , respectively, and is adjusted to 30 mm when the radius Rf of curved inner surface 9f is 10.5 meters.Since distance AL is constant in the casting direction, an advantage results in that the nonuniform temperature distribution on the curved inner surface 9f as seen in the curved direction of curved mold 18 is eliminated, especially in the upper portion of the curved mold 18 where the temperature is high.In curved mold 18 according to the present invention, in which distance AL is adjusted to 30 mm and radius Rf of curved inner surface 9f, specifically, is 10.5 meters, the thickness of the second copper plate section 13f is less than that of a conventional curved mold 1 Fig. 3 when the thickness of conventional curved mold 1 Fig. 3 is measured at the upper and lower portions thereof and between the curved inner surface 9f and the cooling water channels, i.e., vertical cooling water channel 10f Fig. 3 and the curved cooling water channel 19 Fig. 6 .That is, no locally thick portion of the second copper plate section 13f where ALmax sst i 6 mm is present in curved mold 18 Fig. 6 of the present invention. As a result, not only it is possible to maintain the entire inner surface of the curved mold 18 at a temperature of 4000C or less and thus effectively prevent breakout due to the strand s shell sticking to the inner surface of curved mold 18 but it is also possible that the life of the curved mold 18 may not be shortened to less than that of a conventional curved mold 1 Fig. 3 since the thickness of the second copper plate section 13E measured between curved cooling water channel l9f and the curved inner surface 9f is the same as the minimum thickness, i.e. 30 mm, of the second copper plate section in conventional curved mold 1 Fig. 1 . In the curved mold 18 Fig. 6 , the curved cooling water channel 195 is defined and formed in a manner similar to that of vertical cooling water channel 10f Fig. 3 , that is, by means of the first copper plate section 14f and the second copper plate section 13f, which is grooved. In low head CCM 17 Fig. 2 , in which the radius Rf is less than 10.5 meters Rf 10.5 m , the distance At of a curved mold 18, which has a small radius, is preferably a value high enough to ensure that the temperature of the entire inner surface of a curved mold 16 is maintained at 4000C or less in the light of the life of the curved mold 18. In Fig. 7, the structure of the long sided mold section 20Q according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown, and a long sided mold section having the same structure can be used at the fixed side of the strand not shown . In this embodiment, the curved cooling water channel l9Q can be easily fabricated. The long sided mold section 20t comprises a curved copper plate section 21 having a curved groove on one surface thereof and a cooling water box 22Q comprising a curved copper plate section 22at, which is provided with a cooling water inlet and outlet.The curved copper plate section 21 Q is secured to the curved copper plate section 22at so as to form the curved cooling water channel 19 , which is parallel to the curved inner surface 23Q as seen in the vertical direction of the curved mold. In Figs. 8 and 9, embodiments of the curved mold according to the present invention are illustrated. In these figures, the curved mold is denoted by 24 and 27, respectively, and the vertical cross sectional structure of the long sided mold sections Sf and 5Q having the curved inner surfaces 9f and 9 , respectively, is shown but the known vertical cross sectional structure of the short sided mold sections is not shown. In Fig. 8, longitudinal cooling water channels 26f and 26Q of the long side mold sections Sf and 5 , respectively, are defined by three communicating linear cooling water channels 25f 1 , 25f 2 , and 25f and three communicating linear cooling water channels 25 , 25 2 and 25 3 , respectively, and extend virtually in accordance with the curve of the curved inner surfaces 9f and 9Q as seen in the vertical direction of the mold. Not only three but two or more than three communicating linear cooling water channels may define longitudinal cooling water channels 26f and 2 . In Fig. 9, longitudinal cooling water channels 26f and 26Q of the long sided mold sections Sf and 5Q are separated into upper, middle, and lower channels 25f l , 25f 2 , 25f 3 and 25Q 1 25Q 2 , 25f 3 t res pectively.So that cooling water can be separately supplied into and separately withdrawn from the upper, middle, and lower channels 2Sf l , 25f 2 , and 25f 3 in the case of the long sided mold section Sf, the cooling water box 6 is separated into the upper, middle, and lower sections 6f l , 6f 2 , and 6f 3 , these sections being provided with separate lateral cooling water channels elf 1 , lif , and 11f 3 , respectively. Not only three but also two or more than three separated longitudinal channels may be used so as to define, by the arrangement of these separated channels, a cooling water channel which extends virtually in accordance with the curve of curved inner surface 9f as seen in the vertical direction of curved mold 27.
