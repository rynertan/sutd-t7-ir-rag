# VINYL ACETATE INTERPOLYMER LATICES AND ELECTROGRAPHIC RECORDING MATERIAL USING SAME

## Abstract
An aqueous latex consisting essentially of an acid modified vinyl ester interpolymer and 0.8 parts by weight or less of a protective colloid per 100 parts by weight of interpolymer. The vinyl ester interpolymer comprises about 3 to about 7 weight percent of carboxylic acid groups supplied by an interpolymerized C₄ C₁₀ vinylene monobasic carboxylic acid monomer. The aqueous latex is useful as an aqueous dielectric coating binder in the manufacture of electrographic recording materials which comprise a con ductive paper support coated with an electrically insulating layer comprising an intimate blend of such latex and up to 500 parts of an inert finely divided pigment per 100 parts by weight of latex interpolymer.
