# PREPARATIONS FOR MAKING SINTERED PROCELAIN PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF MAKING SUCH PRODUCTS

## Abstract
A heat sinterable porcelain powder mix for preparing a sin tered porcelain product of a desired color, particularly for use in the fabrication of dental appliances, comprises an admixture of a porcelain powder with an organic liquid binder. The liquid binder has an index of refraction the same or substantially the same as the index of refraction of the porcelain powder, there by permitting visualization of the true post sintered color of the porcelain powder mix during application and prior to heat sin tering. A method of preparing a sintered porcelain product in volves preparation of the said powder binder mix, applying it to a substrate, checking and if necessary adjusting the color of the applied mix, and thereafter heat sintering the coated sub strate to produce a dental artefact.
