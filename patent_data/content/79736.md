# Internal combustion engine for hydrogen gas.

## Abstract
A hydrogen gas internal combustion engine has a hydrogen gas jet nozzle 6 and a water spray jet nozzle 7 arranged to jet hydrogen gas 8 and water spray 9 directly into the combustion chamber 10 in which air has been compressed. The water is instantly vaporized to steam by the igniting hydrogen gas so that the combustion explosion energy of the hydrogen gas and the energy generated by the vaporizarion of the steam are used in combination to obtain mechanical energy. This system is applicable to different types of internal combustion engines, e.g. reciprocating piston engines, rotary engines, and gas turbines.
