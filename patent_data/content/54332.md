## Abstract
Method and apparatus for lowering and positioning a pipe line onto the bottom of a deep water, said pipe line being assembled from pipe sections on deck of a ship, which pipe line from the said bottom of the water extends upwardly according to a curved path 18 followed by a straight portion 17 and finally by a second curved part, said pipe line being held under tension by the ship to maintain the radius of curvature R a sufficiently large said tension according to the invention being performed from the ship directly upon the rectilinear part 17 of the pipe line whilst above said point of engagement of the tensional force the pipe line is subjected to a bending moment only. The apparatus preferably has a rotatable tube 2 in the ship through which the upper part of the pipe line extends vertically upwardly into a derrick 15 for assembling pur poses. Said ship having below the hull a horizontal outrigger 3 with a travelling crab 4 with cables 16 of tackles 4 running to clamps 5, 6 which in turn can hold the pipe line 17, 18 and further an angle lever system 7, 8 with pipe line guide elements 10 and a bending device 11 .
