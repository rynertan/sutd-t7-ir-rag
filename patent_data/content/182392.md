# Releasable hinge.

## Abstract
Improvements in separable hinge mechanisms. A pro blem with such mechanisms is that, over a relatively long hinge axis, the hinge pins tend to bind due to misalignment. The invention provides positive alignment and minimizes off center loads. Mechanism 8 has two opposing integral leaves 10, 20 . Each leaf 10, 20 has a plurality of knuckles 12, 30, 32, 32 attached thereto. These form a plurality of axially spaced hinge stations 18 . Each station 18 has a corresponding hinge pin 28 . Each pin 28 is attached to one of two slide bars 22 that are mounted on leaf 20 for sliding movement parallel to axis X . Bars 22 are mount ed by a center mounting lug 42 and guide rod 46 that car ries a spring abutment 26 for each bar 22 . Leaves 10, 20 are separated by squeezing toward each other two adjacent finger tabs 24 , one on each bar 22 . This compresses two springs 48 mounted on rod 46 which bias the bars 22 and pins 28 into a position in which leaves 10, 20 are con nected.
