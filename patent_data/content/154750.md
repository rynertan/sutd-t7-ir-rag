# Process for separating wax and deeply dewaxed oil from waxy hydrocarbon oil.

## Abstract
Refined waxes and dewaxed lubricating oil basestocks are simultaneously produced in a reversed deoiling dewax ing process employing conventional dewaxing solvents and existing process equipment. Improved yields, lower solvent usage, and higher throughputs are achieved using dewax ing aids in the final stage. Waxy hydrocarbon oils 1 or 4 are solvent dewaxed to a temperature which produces a low oil content refined high melting point hard wax product 8 which is recovered, e.g., by filtration 7 . The hard wax product 8 can be deoiled 11, 12, 9 . The filtrate 15 from the initial dewaxing operation is then injected with dewax ing aid 28, 31 and further chilled in secondary chiller means 16 , such as scraped surface chillers, to a lower temperature to produce more deeply dewaxed oil 22 and a low melting point soft wax product 23 which are separated, e.g., by filtration 20 . The low melting point wax is desolvated 24 and the dewaxing aid may be recovered 26 , for example by passing the wax through a membrane or by distillation. Any recovered dewaxing aid may be recy cled 28 to the process.
