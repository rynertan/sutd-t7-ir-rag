# Melt processable wholly aromatic polyester composition containing a phosphorus ester, process for the preparation thereof, and moulded articles, films and fibres based thereon.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a melt processable composition and process for preparing the same from a blend of a normally non melt processable wholly aromatic polyester and a phosphorus ester. The presence of the specifically defined phosphorus ester in the composition in amounts of up to about 40 percent by weight renders the normally non melt processable wholly aromatic polyester melt processable.
