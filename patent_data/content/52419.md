The exemplified reactions demostrate that the products obtained are predominantly composed of normal chain hydrocarbons. In general, the single metal salt catalyst systems are non selective for the iso t form of the carboxylic acid products, tending to yield either predominantly straight chain products, or a slightly favored distribution of isoproducts. Any catalyst system to be utilized in the hydrocarboxylation reaction must be thermally stable at the temperatures required for the reaction to effectively occur. Other factors which effect the hydrocarboxylation reaction are the molar ratios of catalyst to stabilizing ligands, to the reactants, and to other components of the system. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for the hydrocarboxylation of propylene in the liquid phase, to produce butyric acid wherein the isobutyric acid isomer product predominates. This is achieved, inter alia, by the use of a particular active catalyst system which is thermally stable and which does not readily lose selectivity at the reaction temperatures required. According to the present invention there is provided a process for the selective hydrocarboxylation of propylene to produce butyric acid in the liquid phase at a temperature of 750C to 1500C and a pressure of 250 2 psi to 5000 psi 17.5 to 350 kg em wherein the isobutyric acid isomer product predominates, comprising forming a reaction mixture of propylene, carbon monoxide and water in the presence of a catalyst comprising palladium or a palladium compound, a hydrogen halide and a phosphamine liqand. In general, the process of the present invention includes the preparation of predominantly isobutyric acid in the liquid phase. A reaction mixture is formed from propylene, carbon monoxide and water in a suitable solvent in the presence of an active palladium catalyst system. The reaction mixture is subjected to a temperature of 750C to 1500C and a pressure of 250 psi to 5000 psi. 17.5 to 350 kg cm2 ,, The catalyst system generally includes palladium or a palladium compound a phosphoamine promoter ligand compound and a hydrogen halide. The preparation of the iso or branched isomer of butyric acid from propylene, carbon monoxide and water in the liquid phase proceeds according to the following catalyzed reaction.EMI4.1 tb SEP H tb Cll3CII C112 SEP SEP CO SEP SEP H20 SEP catalyst SEP SEP C SEP SEP COH tb SEP CH3 tb SEP CH3 tb The formation of n butyric acid, in which all the carbon atoms form a straight chain, is to be minimized to the greatest extent possible. The production of predominantly the iso form of butyric acid is made possible according to the invention by the choice of catalyst system, including stabilizing and promoting ligands and complexing acids. The following reaction mechanism has been proposed forth preparation of isobutyric acid from propylene, carbon monoxide and water. This mechanism is merely theoretical and in no way is intended to limit the scope of the present invention, but rather is provided to illustrate the reaction in question.EMI5.1 The catalyst system according to the present invention includes a phosphoamine ligand stabilized promoted, palladium or a palladium compound together with a complexing hydrogen halide acid, preferably hyrochloric acid, optionally with other strong acids, preferably in addition to HCl. The palladium or palladium compound utilized according to the present invention is capable of coordinating carbon monoxide, propylene and water as is demonstrated in the reaction mechanism above. It is preferred that the palladium component of the catalyst be present as a solution of a palladium salt in at least the 2 valence state. Suitable palladium salts include palladium acetate, palladium chloride, palladium nitrate and the like. The molar ratio of propylene fed in the reaction to the palladium present, whether in a batch type reaction or a continuous reaction, is 1 1 to 1000 1, preferably about 100 1. The catalyst system, that is, the palladium or palladium compound and its ligand promoter, may be easily recovered after reaction by separating the products form the reaction mixture by conventional methods, such as distillation. The transformation of the palladium catalyst which is selective to the production of isobutyric acid to a non selective form is inhibited in part by the incorporation of stabilizing ligands in the catalyst system. Stabilizing ligands which function effectively as promoters for reaction include phosphoamines of the general formulaEMI6.1 where R1, R2 and R4 are independently selected from substituted or unsubstituted amines or alkyls of one to about twelve carbon atoms and aryls, and wherein at least one R is an amine represented by the general formulaEMI6.2 wherein R5 and R6 are independently selected from H, lower alkyl and aryl.The substituents or substitutedR groups may be lower alkyl, alkoxyde, acid, ester, carbonyl, aromatic, halide, cyanide or the like, and in the case of an aryl group the substituent is in the meta and or para position. The substituents must not adversely affect the hydrocarboxylation reaction under the conditions of the process, and must be stable at the reaction conditions used. We have found that phosphines in which a hydrocarbon group such as a phenyl group separates phosphorus from an amine group P is not bonded to N such as tris 4 dimethylaminophenyl phosphine, are not stable under reaction conditions tending to decompose over the course of the reaction. Triaminophosphines, particularly tris dimethylamino phosphine, are preferred stabilizing promoting ligands Phosphoamines may be prepared according to methods known in the art. The molar ratio of PR3 Pd according to the present invention is within the range of 1 1 to 100 1, and preferably within the range of 2 1 to 50 1. The catalyst system requires a hydrogen halide which is capable of being coordinated with the palladium metal ion. Hydrogen chloride is preferred and may be supplied to the reaction in aqueous or anhydrous form dr as a compound which is capable of releasing HC1 under the reaction conditions. EBr and HI can also be used, but the activity of the catalyst system is lower when these are used alone. Mixtures of HCl and HBr orHC1 and HI are also used to lend stability to the system,Other strong acids may be added to the system as a complexing acid in addition to the hydrogen halide, such as H2 S, H2S04, HCN, H2P04 and HBF4. The amine may also be protonated. The halide component of the hydrogen halide should be present in a molar ratio of 5 1 to 500 1 with respect to the palladium in the system. A preferred ratio ofHCl Pd is from 50 1 to 150 1, throughout which range conversion and selectivity to isobutyric acid remain high. A HCl Pd ratio of 90 1 is most preferred. The molar ratio of propylene fed in the reaction to the halide component present is preferably within the range of 1 1 to 1000 1. Suitable solvents for use according to the present invention include inert organic solvents such as benzene or substituted aromatic compounds, carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, esters, ethers such as dioxane, aldehydes, ketones and the like. The product acid may also be utilized as the solvent. The reaction of the propylene, carbon monoxide and.water in the presence of the ligand stabilized palladium catalyst should be conducted at a temperature in the range of 750C to 1500 C. Preferred temperatures are within the range of 900C to 1250C, At low temperature, the rate of reaction is unacceptably slow, and at temperatures higher than 1500C the catalyst system becomes unstable. The molar ratio of water to propylene in the reaction medium should be maintained with the range of 0.01 1 to 10 1, Preferably the molar ratio of water to propylene is maintained at 1 1 to 2 1. The reaction should be carried out under a carbon monoxide pressure within the range of 250 psi to 5000 psi, 17.5 to 350 kg cm2 . Prefered CO pressures are from 400 psi to 1200 psi. It has been found that maintaining the reaction at these pressure results in a favorable rate of reaction, and an increase of selectivity to isobutyric acid. Maintaining the reaction at high pressure additionally allows a greater throughput to desired products per unit of time. The following examples illustrate the invention Introduction A series of illustrative reactions were carried out in a 300 ml Bastelloy C autoclave in pyrex glass liners. Although the examples were carried out as a batch type reactions to illustrate the present invention it is intended that the scope of the present invention include continuous feed type reactions also. Analysis of liquid product was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5710 A gas chromatograph. Valeric acid was used as the internal standard, and column packing was PolyesterFF trademark of Nishio Industries . Analysis of gases was performed on a Carle III gas analyzer using a Houdry dual column with thermisters as detectors. The reaction in the examples set forth below were run in the following manner. A pre weighed amount of palladium acetate, promoter ligand, solvent, water and hydrogen halide was placed into the glass liner. The promoter ligands, and the concentrations of promoter ligands and hydrogen halide were varied as set forth in the examples and Table below. After the addition of the above to the autoclave the autoclave was sealed and mechanical stirring begun The autoclave was flushed once with an 800 psi 56 kg cm2 charge of carbon monoxide. The propylene was then added to the autoclave from a pre weighed bomb and the amount of propylene added was measured by weight difference.Carbon monoxide was added to bring the pressure of the autoclave up to 450 psi 31.5 kg cm2 . The temperature was then increased to the run temperature, and the time was recorded. Carbon monoxide was added to the reactor as needed after it reached run temperature and pressure by the use of a reservoir filled with carbon monoxide.A record of the rate of carbon monoxide addition was made using a pressure transducer attached to a recorder. After the reaction was completed, the autoclave was cooled with cold running water. The entire volume of gas vented from the autoclave was collected in a multilayered gas sampling bag, measured using a wet test meter, and a sample was injected into the Carle III gas analyzer. The liquid effluent was weighed and analyzed as set forth above. The results of thereactionruns are reported in theTable below as follows. Conversion Moles of all Products Produced x 100 Moles of Proylene Fed Selectivity Moles of Isobutyric Acid Produced x 100 Moles of All Products Examples 1 6 In Examples 1 6 inclusive, 0.1185 g palladium acetate was added to 100 ml solvent acetic acid except for example 5 in which octanoic acid was used together with an amount of tris dimethylaminophosphine and HC1 38 sufficient to establish the catalyst ratios given in the Table 9.08 g water was added in each example. The catalysts prepared in Examples 1 6 were run according to the procedure given above. The results of the reaction runs together with the reaction pressure.amount of propyiene fed and reaction time are reported in the Table. Unless noted differently in the Table, the reactions were run at a temperature of 1100C and 2 a carbon monoxide pressure of at least 450 psi 31.5 kg cm in 100ml acetic acid solvent. The molar ratio of water to propylene in the reaction mixture was maintained in a ratio of 0.5 1 to 2 1. Comparative Examples A B In comparative examples A B the procedures given above were repeated, except that the promoter ligand added was triphenylphosphine. As can be seen from the above Examples and Table, the hydrocarboxylation of propylene with carbon monoiSdd and water in the presence of a catalyst comprising palladium or a palladium compound, a phosphoamine ligand compound and a hydrogen halide, produces a high conversion to butyric acid, particularly with an unexpectedly high selectivity to isobutyric acid, generally of about 70 or greater. The ratio of isobutyric acid to n butyric acid produced by the process of the present invention is 3.5 or greater, compared to less than 2.5 which is achieved when promoter ligands such as triphenylphos phine, described in the prior art, are used.
