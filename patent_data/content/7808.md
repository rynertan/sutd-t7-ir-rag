# Hub alignment.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring the road wheel hub alignment of a vehicle on its production line includes a pair of electro optical units 11 for attachment to a pair of road wheel hubs 12 and a master control and display unit 18 . The electro optical units each comprise an array of photo sensitive devices 17 which are illuminated by a directional beam of light 14 from the other unit, and include a display 22, 24 for indicating to an operator the state of alignment of the hub to which the unit is attached. Alignment of both hubs can be monitored by a display 21, 23 on the master control unit, which includes an output to a data recording means so that the state of alignment of the hubs on each vehicle passing down the line can be automatically recorded. The photo sensitive devices are arranged in a radial plane of the axis X about which the hubs swivel for adjustment, and in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the road wheels Y Y , to enable simultaneous independent adjustment of the hubs.
