## Description
This invention relates to polyarylene thioether fibers having certain physical properties of exceptionally excellent high values herein referred to as high quality fibers and a method for continuously producing these fibers. More particularly, it relates to high quality fibers having properties which heretofore have not been mutually compatible and consisting essentially of a linear polyarylene thioether having a melt viscosity of 5,300 to 20,000.10 ¹Pa.s at 310 C and a shear velocity of 200 second ¹ and relates as well as to a method for continuously producing these high quality fibers without breaking and fluffing. It has been expected that a polyarylene thioether and especially polyphenylene thioether can be processed into heat resistant fibers having excellent properties, because they are highly crystalline thermoplastic polymers having thermal resistance. For example, methods for producing such fibers are disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 30609 1977, Japanese Laid open Patent Application Nos. 143518 1982 and 31112 1983 Specifications, etc. These methods, however, use as starting materials a polymer having a relatively low melt viscosity, a non linear polymer produced by high temperature curing, or a non linear polymer produced with a crosslinking agent in the course of polymerization. The unsatisfactory properties of fibers and the like observed in the case of a polymer having low melt viscosity may have been solved by the use of the latter non linear polymer. Such non linear polymers, however, have poor spinnability and stretchability and suffer from breaking and fluffing in the course of continuous melt spinning and continuous stretching. Thus, it has been very difficult to industrially produce stretched filaments. On the other hand, a linear polymer which is not crosslinked without the high temperature crosslinking or crosslinking polymerization has lacked satisfactorily high melt viscosity. Such linear polymers have excellent spinnability and stretchability but have unsatisfactory fiber properties, have bad melt breaking resistance, and suffer from melt breaking and fluffing in the course of continuous melt spinning and subsequent continuous heat setting. Thus, it has been also difficult to industrially produce stretched heat set fibers and to obtain fibers having excellent mechanical properties and thermal resistance. In order to solve the above mentioned problems, we have conducted intensive research and have found that stretched heat set polyarylene thioether fibers can be continuously produced by using as the starting material a non crosslinked i.e., linear structure polyarylene thioether having an especially high molecular weight i.e., not less than 5,300.10 ¹Pa.s at 310 C and a shear velocity of 200 second ¹ in terms of melt viscosity and selecting suitable processing conditions. Thus, the high quality polyarylene thioether fiber according to the present invention is characterized by simultaneously satisfying the following conditions As the starting material for the polyarylene thioether fibers obtained by the present invention, use is made of a linear polyarylene thioether having melt viscosity of 5,300 to 20,000.10 ¹Pa.s at 310 C, a shear velocity of 200 second ¹ . These fibers have excellent mechanical properties such as tensile strength and tensile modulus of elasticity, which properties could not be obtained by using conventional polyarylene thioether resins of a linear and low melt viscosity polymer or a cure crosslinked or polymerization crosslinked polymer. Moreover, the present polyarylene thioether has excellent thermal resistance e.g., tensile strength at 200 C of not less than 196.14MPa 20kg sq.mm and also is not subject to fluffing and the like. Use of the high molecular linear polyarylene thioether having a melt viscosity of 5,300 to 20,000. 10 ¹Pa.s at 310 C and a shear velocity of 200 second ¹ has made it possible to continuously conduct melt spinning, stretching and heat setting steps and to industrially produce arylene thioether fibers having the above mentioned excellent properties without fluffing and breakage. In contrast, conventional low molecular or crosslinked polyarylene thioether resins often cause fluffing and breaking. It has been difficult to conduct continuous spinning, stretching and heat setting steps. Thus, the fibers having such excellent properties as produced according to the present invention could not be obtained because of insufficient stretching and heat setting with the conventional low molecular polymer. The polymer to be used in the present invention is a polyarylene thioether. One of the important points is to select as the starting material a polymer having excellent spinnability, stretchability and melt breaking resistance. Thus the polymer should be a linear type. That is, the polymer contains as the main component a repeating unit of wherein the Ar stands for an aromatic hydrocarbon group. Especially, a polymer having the repeating unit of as the main component is highly preferred from the viewpoint of crystallizability, heat resistant mechanical strength, chemical resistance, costs, etc. Of these polymers, a polymer containing in the polymeric chain 50 molar or a blockwise fashion is especially preferred because of its very excellent moldability in addition to the above mentioned characteristics. The polyarylene thioether to be used in the present invention is a linear polyarylene thioether. The linear polyarylene thioether herein means a polyarylene thioether obtained by polymerization via dehalogenation sulfiding of an alkali sulfide and a dihalo substituted aromatic hydrocarbon substantially without using a crosslinking agent or a branching agent e.g., a tri or higher polyhalogen substituted aromatic hydrocarbon in the course of polymerization and also without substantially conducting crosslinking treatment after the polymerization e.g., treatment of curing the polymer at a high temperature in the presence of oxygen to enhance its melt viscosity . Thus, the molecular structure of the resulting polymer is considered to be substantially linear. In this connection, a polyarylene thioether intentionally crosslinked or branched in the course of production of the polymer i.e., during or after the polymerization cannot be easily produced industrially into highly stretched fibers because such polymers have inadequate spinnability and stretchability and often cause breaking and fluffing in continuous melt spinning and continuous stretching steps. On the other hand, a linear polyarylene thioether produced without intentional crosslinking or branching treatment in the course of production of the polymer can be industrially processed into highly stretched fibers without breaking and fluffing in the continuous melt spinning and continuous stretching steps, when suitable conditions are selected and a spinning oil is used. The linear polyarylene thioether to be used in the present invention has a melt viscosity in the range of 5,300 to 20,000.10 ¹Pa.s at 310 C and a shear velocity of. 200 second ¹ . Especially preferred are those having a melt viscosity of 6,000 to 20,000.10 ¹Pa.s, more preferably 7,000 to 15,000.10 ¹Pa.s. A linear polyarylene thioether having a melt viscosity of less than 5,300.10 ¹Pa.s cannot easily be industrially subjected to continuous heat setting because melt breaking and fluffing often take place in the course of continuous heat setting of stretched fibers. Also, a polyarylene thioether having a melt viscosity of more than 20,000.10 ¹Pa.s which may have a linear structure, is not desirable because melt fracture takes place in the course of melt spinning to decrease spinnability and stretchability, and moreover breaking and fluffing often take place. As described above, it is necessary that the polymer used to obtain the present high property stretched heat set filaments be a linear polyarylene thioether having a melt viscosity of 5,300 to 20,000.10 ¹Pa.s. In this respect, water added two step polymerization process and process for production cf superhigh molecular polyarylene thioether according to our previous inventions disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No. 126725 1984 and No. 188533 1984 Specifications can be suitably applied to produce the polymers satisfying the above mentioned conditions. The present invention is related to fibers produced from linear polyarylene thioether resins thus obtained. In general, such a linear polyarylene thioether can be blended with other melt miscible thermoplastic resins as a thermoplastic resin to form a blend. Thus, the linear polyarylene thioether to be used in the present invention should be understood to encompass such a blend thereof with a small amount of other melt miscible thermoplastic resins as long as such a blended resin does not impair the aim of the present invention. Also, a fiber forming thermoplastic resin in certain instances contains auxiliary materials such as delustering agents, coloring agents and stabilizers. It should be thus understood that the linear polyarylene thioether herein can contain such auxiliary materials. The term spinning herein means a step of shaping a polymer into filaments. The spinning method in the present invention is a continuous melt spinning method. The continuous melt spinning means to continuously produce spun filaments by continuously extruding a molten polymer through an extruder equipped with a nozzle and reeling up the filaments with a reeling machine. The melt spinning can be conducted by heat melting the starting polymer to be used in the present invention at a temperature not lower than the melting point thereof, melt extruding it through a nozzle having orifices of about 0.1 to about 2 mm in diameter, and taking up the resulting filament like extrudate. The ratio of the take up speed of the filament like extrudate from the nozzle to the extrusion speed i.e., so called ratio R₁ is preferably in the range of from 10 to 1000. It is especially preferable that the R₁ be in the range of from 20 to 700 because then an intended high quality product i.e., stretched heat set filaments can be obtained without breaking and fluffing. According to the method of the present invention, spun filaments can be produced over a long period of operation without substantial breaking and fluffing. Stretching is conducted in succession to the step of spinning. Stretching means a process of drawing spun filaments by applying stress thereto in the length wise direction. By orientating the polymer molecules to cause some crystallization in the course of stretching, the porperties such as crystallinity, mechanical properties and thermal resistance of the final product can be enhanced. The stretching method used in the present invention is a continuous stretching method. The continuous stretching method is not stretching of spun filaments in a batch wise fashion, but means a method of continuously producing stretched filaments by continuously supplying spun filaments to a stretching region. As a stretcher, a conventional stretching apparatus comprising a combination of godet rolls and a heating plate, heating pins, a heating roll, an infrared heater, a microwave heater, a hot air bath or a heating medium bath can be used. Especially, the heating plate, heating pins, heating roll and the like are suitable for the stretching of the present polyarylene thioether filaments. The stretch ratio is preferably in the range of 2 to 15 times, and more preferably 2.5 to 10 times. When the ratio is less than 2 times, orientation of polymer chains in the filament is insufficient, and the resulting product lacks mechanical strength, thermal reistance, etc. A ratio of more than 15 times is not desirable because it gives rise to breaking and fluffing in many cases. The stretching temperature is not higher than the melting point of the polymer used and is preferably a temperature between the glass transition temperature and the glass transition temperature plus 60 C of the polymer. A temperature lower than the glass transition temperature is not desirable because molecular orientation of the polymer does not take place, and breaking and fluffing often occur. On the other hand, the stretching at a temperature higher than the transition temperature plus 60 C fails to enhance the properties of the final product because molecular motion of the polymer is too vigorous, and the spun filaments are drawn with random directions of the molecules. Spinning at a temperature higher than the melting point of the polymer is not desirable because of melt breaking of spun filaments. A spinning oil is preferably used in the continuous stretching step. As the spinning oil to be used in the stretching and also heat setting as detailed below of spun filaments of the linear polyarylene thioether according to the present invention, especially preferred is a combinaiton of a so called smoothing agent such as aromatic carboxylate esters, higher fatty acid esters, vegetable oils or mineral oils with a surface active agent. It is desirable to apply these agents in an emulsion state to spun filaments before the step of stretching. The heat setting is a step of setting or promoting the molecular orientation and crystalline structure of the spun fibers obtained in the stretching step to obtain the fibers of excellent mechanical properties, thermal resistance and the like. The heat setting method to be used in the present invention is a continuous heat setting method. The continuous heat setting method is not such a batch wise heat setting as to heat set the hank of filaments but is a method of producing heat set filaments by continuously delivering stretched filaments to a heat setting region for continuous heat setting. As a heat setting machine, a conventional heat setting apparatus such as a heating plate, heating pins, a heating roll, an infrared or microwave heater, a hot air bath and a heating medium bath can be used. For example, a draw twister comprising a stretching apparatus and a heat setting apparatus in combination can also be employed. In the heat setting step, it is necessary to heat the stretched fibers to be heat set to a temperature not lower than the melting point thereof minus 100 C . A heating temperature not lower than the melting point is not desirable because of melt breaking of the fiber. At a temperature lower than the melting point minus 100 C , an excessively long time is needed to conduct sufficient heat setting, which is economically undesirable for industrially prodoucing continuously heat set fibers. The heat setting can be amply conducted in one step for ordinary purposes. When high thermal resistance, high elasticity and the like are needed, however, it is also possible to conduct multi stage heat setting steps with different temperatures. The period of heat setting is suitably selected depending on the thickness of fibers, type of heating apparatus, the temperature of heat setting, etc. In general, however, it is preferably in the range of 0.02 to 100 seconds. When the period is less than 0.02 second, it is difficult to raise the temperature of the fiber itself. When the heat setting period is over 100 seconds, it is economically difficult to industrially conduct the continuous spinning, stretching and heat setting steps according to the present invention. The present polyarylene thioether fibers produced under the above mentioned processing conditions from the starting linear polyarylene thioether having melt viscosity of 5,300 to 20,000.10 ¹Pa.s at 310 C and a shear velocity of 200 second ¹ are stretched heat set fibers having markedly excellent properties, in comparison with the conventional polyarylene thioether fibers c.f. Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Vol. 18, page 793 . The present fibers are in the form of multifilaments or monofilaments, that is, continuous fibers. The fiber diameter thereof is in the range of 1 to 50 µm. According to the present method described above, fibers of fiber diameters in such a range can be readily obtained. In the case of multifilaments, thinner fibers are more easily produced. In the case of monofilaments, thicker fibers are more easily produced. The present fibers are characterized by high tensile strength of 392.28 MPa 40 kg sq.mm or more. It is comparatively easy to obtain the fibers having tensile strengths of 588.42 Mpa 60kg sq.mm or more depending on fiber diameter and stretching heat setting conditions. The present fibers have a tensile modulus of elasticity of not less than 4903.5 Mpa 500kg mm . It is also comparatively easy to obtain fibers having moduli of elasticity of 6864.9 MPa 700 kg sq.mm or more by suitably selecting fiber diameter and stretching heat setting conditions. Another feature of the present fibers is good thermal resistance. More specifically, filaments having high temperature strength, for example, thermal resistance shown by tensile strength at 200 C of 196.14 MPa 20 kg sq.mm or more can be readily obtained. The present fibers also have excellent chemical resistance, flame retardance, etc. Whether the present fibers are in a dry state or a wet state has almost no influence on their properties. In contrast, the properties of aramide fibers poly p phenyleneterephthalic amide fibers, poly m phenyleneterephthalic amide fibers are halved in value in their wet state. The present stretched heat set fibers produced from a high molecular linear polyarylene thioether can be applied to a variety of uses by utilizing their characteristics, such as industrial filters, reinforcing fibers, heat resistant clothing, heat insulators, tire cords, tapes for prepreg, wire coating materials and motor insulators. For a pre step polymerization, a 20 liter titanium lined autoclave was charged with 11.0 kg of N methyl 2 pyrrolidone hereinafter referred to as NMP and 20.0 mols of Na₂S 5H₂O salt crystals, and the mixture was gradually heated to about 200 C with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere to distill off 1.27 kg of water, 1.57 kg of NMP and 0.46 mol of H₂S. After allowing the system to cool to 130 C, 19.73 mols of p dichlorobenzene hereinafter referred to as P DCB and 3.2 kg of NMP were added thereto, and polymerization was carried out at 210 C for 9 hours thus ending the pre step polymerization . Then, water was added to the polymerization system so that the water present therein reached the ratio shown in Table 1. The mixture was heated under a nitrogen atmosphere and further subjected to polymerization post step polymerization under the polymerization conditions shown in Table 1. After cooling, the resulting polymerization mixture was filtrated, repeatedly washed with deionized water and then dried at 100 C for 3 hours, to obtain polyphenylene thioether polymers P 1 through P 4 . The procedure of Synthesis 1 was followed except for the use of a mixture of 19.00 mols of P DCB and 0.73 mol of meta dichlorobenzene herein referred to as M DCB in place of 19.73 mols of P DCB. Polyphenylene thioether P 5 was obtained. A titanium lined 20 liter autoclave was charged with 11.0 kg of NMP and 16.0 mols of Na₂S 5H₂O salt crystals, and the mixture was heated with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere to distill off water. The S content distilled away as H₂S was 1.5 molar . After cooling, 16.1 mols of P DCB and 3.0 kgs of NMP were added thereto and the resulting mixture was subjected to polymerization at 210 C for 10 hours. Then, 53 mols of water was added thereto, and the mixture was reacted at 250 C for 0.25 hour. The resulting reaction mixture liquor P thus prepared was taken out of the autoclave and stored. A small amount of the liquor P was sampled to measure the polymerization degree of the resulting p phenylene thioether prepolymer by fluorescent X ray method . The degree of polymerization was 300. Separately, a 20 liter autoclave was charged with 11.0 kg of NMP and 16.0 mols of Na₂S 5H₂O, and the mixture was heated to about 200 C to distill off water loss of the S content 1.5 molar . Then, 15.5 mols of M DCB, 3.0 kg of NMP and 53 mols of water were added thereto. The resulting mixture was cooled with stirring to prepare an unreacted mixture liquor M , which was then taken out of the autoclave and stored. Then, a 20 liter autoclave was charged with 13.6 kg of the liquor P and 3.4 kgs of the liquor M , and the mixture was reacted at 262 C for 5 hours. After termination of the reaction, the resulting reaction mixture was separated by filtration, washed with hot water and dried under reduced pressure to recover a phenylene thioether block copolymer P 6 . By way of infrared analysis, the ratio of repeating units present in the polymer block was determined. As a For the comparison, the pre step polymerization process of the syntheses 1 through 4 was repeated except that a mixture of 19.68 mols of P DCB and 0.05 mol of 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene was used instead of 19.73 mols of P DCB. Only the pre step polymerization at 250 C for 4 hours without a post step polymerization was conducted to obtain a crosslinked polyphenylene thioether P 7 . Also for the comparison, the pre step polymerization process of the syntheses 1 through 4 was repeated except that the pre step polymerization was conducted at 250 C for 4 hours to obtain a polymer melt viscosity 320.10 ¹Pa.s . poise . The resulting polymer was heated in air at 250 C for 8 hours to obtain a heat treated crosslinked polyphenylene thioether P 8 . The synthetic conditions and properties of the eight polyphenylene thioether polymers are shown in the following Table 1. As to the polymer P 1 , the same synthetic reactions were conducted in 5 batches, and the resulting polymers of three batches were blended. The resulting polymer blend was used as the polymer P 1 sample in the spinning experiment given below.
