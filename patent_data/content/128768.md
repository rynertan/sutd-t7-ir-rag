# Optical fiber coupling apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for coupling the ends of two lengths of optical fiber in axiaily adjoining and aligned position, comprising two connector assemblies, each connector assembly 26 comprising a three pin sub assembly 32 comprising three like size, substantially cylindrical, rigid pins extending parallel to each other in contiguous relationship, said pins having a diameter such that an inscribed circle extending tangent to the pin circumferences in an interior space between the pins substantially corresponds to the diameter of a said length of optical fiber said interior space extending between the circumference of the pins thereby defining a chamber 34 for receiving a said length of optical fiber first retaining means 28 for securely retaining the pins of the sub assembly in said contiguous relationship, second retaining means 42 for providing stress relieving space for the optical fiber adjacent the distal end of the three pin sub assembly, spring loaded retaining means 46 for securing an optical fiber within the chamber 34 defined by the three pins of the sub assembly by exertion of a radial compressive force on said optical fiber, and coupling means 84 for connecting the connector assembly 26 to its mating connector assembly. The apparatus enables two optical fibers to be coupled in precise manner which minimizes losses at the connection interface and enables the ends of the optical fibers to be protected when the connection is severed.
