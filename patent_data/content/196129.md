## Description
The invention relates to a remote control hand appa ratus for controlling several functions of each of a plurality of modules which for that purpose are coupled to this hand apparatus As is generally known, such a hand apparatus has a plurality of control keys forming the operable portions of switches which are usually arranged in a matrix structure and connected to a control circuit which determines whether a key has been actuated and if so, which one. The control circuit then produces a group of pulses which are characteristic of the relevant key and are applied to a transmitter circuit. In said transmitter circuit this group of pulses modulates an appropriately chosen carrier signal, prefer ably an infrared signal and is thereafter transmitted to the module s , preferably To enable a distinction to be made between the different types of modules, the hand apparatus may be provided with a separate set of control keys for each module. Apart from the fact that the hand apparatus would then become impermissibly large, it would also become very expensive because of the large number of keys. To obviate these disadvantages, European Patent Application No. 0012345 discloses a hand apparatus comprising only a limited number of keys, but with which all the functions of a plurality of modules can yet be controlled. For that purpose this hand apparatus can be set to each of a plurality of modes, for example a select ion mode and a plurality of module modes. In the selection mode one module is assigned to each key or to a number of keys, and when in this mode a given key is actuated, the hand apparatus is set to a module mode and the user accesses the particular module for example the TV receiver assigned to the actuated key. In this module mode the several keys are given control functions which are appropriate for the control of that module. The function a predetermined key can control consequently differs from module mode to module mode. Consequently, the keys of this prior art hand apparatus are multi functional. To inform the user which function is assigned to which key at a given instant, each key is assigned a key display element on which the actual control function of the key is displayed, for example in the form of a symbol. To achieve all this, this prior art hand apparatus comprises a control circuit in the form of a microcomputer to which both the keys and the key display elements are coupled. With this microcomputer it is also possible to control a further display for displaying certain informative texts. There fore, this last mentioned display will be referred to as the in formation display. This prior art hand apparatus has a particularly con veniently arranged control panel, but because the key display ele ments have to be large enough for the actual control function to be shown clearly, whilst the additional information display, and also all the display driver circuits, require much space, this hand apparatus can become impermissibly large in practice. In order to keep the dimensions of this hand apparatus sufficiently small the number of control keys is greatly limited. As a result, several functions can only be controlled after a number of other keys have been operated. Thus, when the hand apparatus is in one module mode it must, for example, be first set to the selection mode before the user can obtain access to another module. The invention has for its object to provide a hand ap paratus of very limited size, which has a particularly conveniently arranged control panel, each module being accessible by a single key actuation. According to the invention, this hand apparatus com prises a plurality of module keys to each of which a module is as signed and with which the user can obtain access only to the rele vant module and one single display element of the dot matrix type around which the multi functional control keys are arranged and on which under the control of a control circuit the actual control functions which are associated with the module to be operated and are assigned to these multi functional keys are displayed. Fig. 1 shows the upper surface of a remote control hand apparatus. This upper surface is divided into three sections, denoted by 10, 20 and 30, respectively. The section 10 is the module section and in this case comprises five module keys 101, 102, 103, 104 and 105. A symbol on each module key indicates to which module access is obtained if the relevant key is actuated. In the Figure, these modules are a TV receiver, a teletext decoder, a video recorder, a module The section 20 comprises generally known and customary control keys, such as the ten figure keys bearing the figures 0 to 9, inclusive, a saturation key 200, a brightness key 201, a treble control key 202, a base control key 203, a balance key 204, a volume key 205, a key 206 for adjusting a module to the stand by condition and a key 207 which enables a selection of either the one or the other language of a dual language TV program. The section 30 comprises a dot matrix display 300 and a number of functional keys 301 to 306 and 307 to 312, arranged around the display. These keys can be given functions which are specific to a given module. The control function assigned to a given multi functional key is displayed on that part of the display 300 ad jacent to the relevant key. For that purpose the display can be divided notionally into twelve display fields 301 312 as shown schematically in Fig. 2. The display field 301 is assigned to the multi functional key 301, that is to say, the control function shown in display field 301 is accomplished when this key 301 is actuated. The same holds for display field 302 and key 302, etc. In a practical embodiment the symbol of the currently operable module is displayed in the display field 307 . As has already been mentioned in the foregoing, the con trol functions displayed on the display are characteristic of the module to be operated and are consequently dependent of the module key which has been actuated. More specifically, if the TV key 101 is actuated, then the display shows, for example, the symbols of Fig. 3. By means of key 302 it is now possible to indicate whether a channel number C or a program number P will be given. By means of key 301 it is possible to indicate whether the channel or program number, as the case may be, is formed by one or two figures. In all other respects the TV receiver is operated with the aid of the keys in section 20. If after a predetermined channel or program has been selected, teletext key 102 is actuated, then, for example, the sym bols shown in Fig. 4 are shown on the display 300, thus indicating the control functions assigned to the multi functional keys 301 306 and 308 312. Finally, if the VCR key 103 is depressed, then, for example, the symbols shown in Fig. 5 are displayed on the display 300. The module keys 104 and 105 are programmable, that is to say a module can be optionally assigned to each of these keys. For example one of the following modules an audio system, a VLP system, a viewdata decoder, a satellite decoder, an audio tuner, etc. To enable programming of these two module keys, the underside of the hand apparatus comprises, for example as shown in Fig. 6 under a cover 40, a programming key 400 and a storage key 401. If the pro gramming key 400 is actuated first, the hand apparatus is set to the programming mode and in the upper half of the display there appears, for example, the text make your choice and at the lower half appear the symbols of the modules from which a selection can be made see Fig. 7 . If now one of the keys 308, 309, ... 312 is actuated, a text appears on the display, for example push key It should be noted that the number of fixed module keys which in the given example is three 101, 102, 103 may be extended. Also the number of modules from which a selection can be made for programming the keyes These separate module keys have the advantage that it is continuously possible to obtain access to the desired module by actuating a key only once. A circuit enabling the above described operation of the hand apparatus is shown in Fig. 13. This circuit comprises a micro computer 500 for example the 80C49. This computer scans the key board 501 and also applies a control signal which depends on the key actuated, to an infrared end stage 502. It also applies data and timing signals The programs required for the control of this circuit are known The symbols shown in the Figures 3, 4, 5, 7 12 are stored in the storage means 506, whereas the text appearing on the display after actuating the programming key is generated by the character generator of the controller 503. In addition, the circuit shown in Fig. 13 comprises an arrangement 508 which is also connected to the microcomputer and produces an acoustic signal, when the hand apparatus is in the pro gramming mode, each time an action different from the one displayed on the display is performed. A voltage detector 509 which measures the battery volt age and, if this battery voltage has fallen to below a predeter mined threshold value regularly, applies a signal to the micro computer in response to which the controller 503 causes a text to apear on the display, thus informing the user of that fact, can further be connected to the microcomputer. In the foregoing it was assumed that for all possible modules the storage means contains the symbols of the associated control functions. It is, however, alternatively possible to couple a read arrangement to the microcomputer such that software applied
