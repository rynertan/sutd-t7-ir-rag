# OFFSHORE PLATFORM STRUCTURAL ASSESSMENT SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system is provided for collecting and interpreting data indicative of the effect of at least one of the pluraltiy of forces acting on an offshore platform structure 177 . The system comprises one or more structural moment detectors 174 and electronic circuitry 175 for processing and manipulating signals derived from the detector or detectors 174 in such a manner as to produce secondary signals indicative of the effect being monitored. In one embodiment, the electronic circuitry 175 associated with each structural moment detector 174 is provided in the same housing as the detector to form a unitary device termed a structural information detector.
