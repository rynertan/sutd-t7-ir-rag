# Process for the manufacture of monopotassium phosphate.

## Abstract
A process for the manufacture of monopotassium phosphate of a high purity without utilizing organic solvents. Monopotassium sulfate is reacted, at a temperature in the range of 40 to 100 C with a phosphate constituent selected from phosphate rock, dicalcium phospate or mixtures thereof in the presence of phosphoric acid. The common metal impurities, organic matter and fluorides present in the starting phosphate rock are substantially eliminated, with the calcium sulfate resulted thereto. After separating out the cal cium sulfate, the filtrate is neutralised to a pH in the range of 3 to 7, with a calcium containing compound comprising Ca OH ₂, CaO or CaCO₃, or mixture thereof. From the filtrate obtained, pure monopotassium phosphate is crystallised out.
