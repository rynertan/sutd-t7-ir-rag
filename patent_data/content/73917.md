# System for rearranging paths in a blocking switching network.

## Abstract
A method is described for rearranging signal paths in a three stage primary, intermediate, tertiary switching net work to permit data or digitized voice signals to be transmit ted from any given primary outlet to any given tertiary inlet. The intermediate stage has fewer inlets than the number of primary stage outlets and fewer outlets than the number of tertiary stage inlets, making the network a conditionally blocking one. Two call rearranging buses CR1, CR2 are provided to assure that each signal path being rearranged is maintained to prevent data transmission drop outs. Primary to intermediate and intermediate to tertiary paths are rearranged one at a time using the call rearranging buses to move free primary and tertiary links to a single intermedi ate matrix.
