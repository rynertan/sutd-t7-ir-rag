## Abstract
A radar transmiitter transmits a group of pulses as shown at I, the group consisting of first short pulse of frequency f, transmitted during time interval t₁ to t₂. A second, longer pulse of frequency f₂ is transmitted during time interval t₂ to t₃ and a third, short pulse of frequency f₁ is transmitted during the interval t₃ to t₄. The return from a close range small target is shown at II and the return from a large source of clutter or another large target at a slightly greater range is shown at III. The return from the larger target or source of clutter is so strong as to saturate the receiver during the time interval t₇ to t₁₂ and thus the return from the second short pulse during period t₉ to t₁₀ is obscured as shown at IV. However, since a short pulse is also transmitted before the long pulse its return, at time interval t₅ to t₆, is not obscured. In other situations where a large source of clutter or a large target is at a slightly closer range than the small target of interest the return during interval t₅ to t₆ will be obscured but the return of the second pulse during time interval t₉ to t₁₀ will not be obscured. In this way it is ensured that at least one of the two short pulses is detected.
