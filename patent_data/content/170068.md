## Description
This invention relates to a bolt fastening method which detects the gradient of fastening torque every time when a bolt is fastened to a predetermined angle to determine when to stop the fastening action based on such torque gradient. Proposed in US A 3 982 419 is a conventional method for detecting the gradient of fastening torque every time when a bolt is fastened to a specific angle, and stops fastening when the torque gradient has decreased by a certain amount from its maximum value on the assumption that the bolt has been fastened down to its yield point. When a bolt is being fastened, presence of dust, flaws, rust, etc. on the contact face of the bolt seat causes the coefficient of friction of the contact face to change, resulting in substantial decrease in the torque gradient this phenomenon is called a torque slip . Also, when there are clearances between the parts being fastened by the bolt, a slip occurs. The above mentioned conventional method erroneously judges that the bolt has been fastened down to its yield point when such slips occur, resulting in stopping the fastening action although the bolt has not been completely tightened. The precharacterizing part of claim 1 refers to a method of fastening a bolt as disclosed in US A 4 027 530. The known apparatus for tightening fasteners comprises a calculating system for determining and storing a maximum gradient signal experienced up to any point in the tightening cycle. When the measured gradient signal falls to a predetermined percentage of the maximum previously stored gradient signal, a control signal is generated stopping the tightening of the assembly. A value of approximately two thirds of the maximum gradient signal has been found to be an acceptable value to ensure that the bolt has been tightened to its yield point. It is a drawback of the known technology that in case of slippage of the screw thread or due to other irregularities such as dust, misadjusting may occur so that the bolt is not fully tightened. According to the known system, a yield point is always assumed if the measured gradient signal falls to a predetermined value. There is no detection as to whether this point is a false or a true yield point because a change in slope of the torque curve may be also caused by irregularities. It is the object of the invention to provide a method for fastening a bolt wherein misadjustment of the bolt due to irregularities such as a slippage or dust may be avoided so that the true yielding point may be found upon tightening of the bolt. This object is solved, according to the invention, with the features contained in claim 1. According to the invention, after the gradient of fastening torque has reached its maximum value, when it becomes a value smaller than a first threshold value, which is obtained by multiplying the maximum value or its approximate maximum value by α α 1 , the bolt is further fastened by a specific angle ϑ₀ which is set to be large enough to clear the slip of fastening torque. Then, one of the following procedures is taken In this invention, even if a false yield point appears because of dust, flaws, rust, etc. on the contact face of a bolt seat or because of clearances between parts fastened by bolt, bolt fastening action is continued until a true yield point appears, thereby enabling proper and secure bolt fastening by eliminating the problems inherent in the conventional method which causes bolt fastening to be stopped due to a false yielding point. Actual applications of this invention are described below, referring to the accompanying drawings. Procedures shown in the flow charts are carried out by a micro computer provided in this fastening device. Referring to Fig. 3, the bolt fastening unit comprises a bolt fastener 3 for fastening the bolt 2. The bolt fastener comprises a reversible motor 4 driven electrically, hydraulically or pneumatically, a speed reducer 6 combined with a clutch 7 for transmitting the motor power to a socket wrench 5, a torque detector 8 for detecting the fastening torque of bolt 2 as an electric signal issued from the socket wrench 5, and a pulse generator 9, such as an incremental encoder, which generates pulse signals every time when the socket wrench 5 is turned by a minute angle ϑ A bolt fastening method of this invention is carried out as follows, using the bolt fastening device. As shown in Fig. 1, various conditions are set such as a sampling turning angle ϑ After setting these conditions, a fastening start signal is issued from the central processing unit CPU 10 of a micro computer 1 as shown in Fig. 3 to an I O port 11. As a result, the motor 4 and the clutch 7 are started by way of a driving circuit 12, causing fastening of the bolt 2 to be started step 101 . Fig. 2 indicates the detail of difference value calculation process as shown in Step 102 of Fig. 1. In the step 102, as shown in the figure, the count value k of the differential counter contained in CPU 10 and the count value a of a sampling number counter is initiated as k 0 and a 0, respectively step 102A and 102B . Then, as the differential counter value is increased by one step 102C , a turning angle input signal is issued to I O port 11. As a result, the pulse signals issued from a pulse generator 9 are taken into judgment as to whether or not the number of such pulse signals has reached a preset constant, that is, the number corresponding to the sampling turning angle ϑ The sampled torque value Ta is added to the memory zero at first of an average value register in CPU 10, and an average value of the added result S k is computed Step 102G . The procedures as shown in steps 102E to 102G are repeated until the judgment in step 102H shows YES, that is, until the count value showing the sampling number of fastening torque becomes When the judgment indicates YES, the average value S When the judgment of step 102H becomes YES, judgment is made as to whether or not the differential counter value K is greater than 1 step 102I . Since the value K is equal to 1 at this point, the judgment of step 102I is No, and hence, the contents as shown in steps 102B to 102I are carried out again. When k 1, that is, when two average values S When the differential value G k is computed, a renewal process of the maximum differential value as shown in step 103 is executed. Since only one differential value G k has been obtained at this point, this differential value is memorized in a maximum differential value register not shown in the figure as a maximum differential value MG. In step 104, judgment is made as to whether or not the bolt 2 has been fastened down to its yield point. Namely, judgment is made as to whether or not the differential value G k , which corresponds to the torque gradient as obtained at step 102J of Fig. 2, has become smaller than MG x α obtained by multiplying the maximum differential value MG by the coefficient α 0.5 in this embodiment . Since G k MG at this point, judgment is NO, thus resuming steps 102B to 102J. In this way, a differential value G k , that represents the torque gradient, is computed every time when the bolt 2 is turned by an angle ϑ Even when the judgment of step 104 becomes YES, it does not necessarily suggest the yield point for the reason that a torque slip phenomenon occurs as shown in the sections B, C in fig. 5 when dust, flaws, rust, etc. exist on the contact face of bolt seat or when there are clearances between parts fastened by the bolt, with the result that the degree of increase in the fastening torque, that is a torque gradient, decreases from the above mentioned MG x α even when the bolt has not been fastened down to its yield point yet. In this embodiment, therefore, as shown in step 105, when judgment of step 104 becomes YES, the bolt is further turned by the angle ϑ₀ so as to judge whether the above judgment shows the true yield point at step 106. Figs. 4, 6, 8, 10, 11 and 13 show actual applications of judgment in step 106, and in the example given in fig. 4, ΔT, that represents the difference between the fastening torque at fastening angle C₁ and C₂ in Fig. 5 when judgment of step 104 becomes YES and that at fastening angle D₁ and D₂ in Fig. 5 that corresponds to angles when the bolt is further turned by ϑ₀ from the angle, is calculated step 106 1A to determine whether ΔT δ δ a preset value step 106 1B . As shown in Fig. 5, when judgment of step 104 becomes YES at C₁, which is not the true yield point of the bolt, the increasing degree ΔT₁ of the fastening torque during turning of the angle ϑ₀ is large, while the fastening torque increasing degree ΔT₂ during ϑ₀ turning is extremely small. The above mentioned preset value δ is set for a little larger than the torque increasing degree ΔT₂ relative to the true yield point hence, when the judgment of step 106 1B is NO, it suggests a false yield point, and the contents shown in steps 102 to 105 are repeated. When a true yield point is detected at step 104, judgment in step 106 1B becomes YES, and a stop signal is issued to I O port 11 to stop fastening the bolt 2 step 107 . The fastening angle ϑ₀ is set large enough to clear the slip shown in the section B₁C₁, that is, set to 2 to 6 times as large as the angle ϑ Torque data, turning angle data, etc. at the time or until fastening is stopped may be recorded on a printer 16 by way of an interface 15, and displayed on CRT 17 step 108 . In the following, descriptions are provided about the actual application of Fig. 6 process. In Fig. 7, when judgment of step 104 at a false yield point C₁ becomes YES, a line segment B₁ D₁ true yield point judgement reference line L₁ , that is drawn by connecting the point B₁ showing torque T On the other hand, when a true yield point is detected at C₂ point, the line segment B₂D₂ the reference line L₂ for judging the truth of yield point will be positioned below the actual torque curve B₂C₂D₂ measured torque curve L₂ . In the embodiment shown in Fig. 6, therefore, the average of the torque T is computed step 106 2B based on each torque value sampled from BD B₁D₂, B₂D₂ and also judgment is made as to whether or not Ta and Tb, calculated results at step 106 2A and step 106 2B respectively, hold the relation of Ta Tb step 106 2C . The value Ta obtained at step 106 2A and the value T In this embodiment, the truth of an yield point is judged based on differences in areas as mentioned above. Apart from this method, a functional form of the line segment BD may be obtained and a torque value on said line segment may be determined by substituting the value of turning angle corresponding to point C for the above function to compare the torque value on the line segment with that at point C. In the embodiment of Fig. 8, judgment is made as to whether or not the torque differential value G k at point C C₁, C₂ of Fig. 9 and G k ϑ₀ just before point D D₁, D₂ hold a relation of G k ϑ₀ G k step 106 3A . As is apparent from Fig. 9, when the judgment of step 104 becomes YES by a false yield point point C₁ , G k ϑ₀ becomes greater than G k , and when the judgment of the same step becomes YES by a true yield point point C₂ , a relation of G k ϑ₂ G k holds. Therefore, depending on a YES or NO judgment of step 106 3A, the true or false of an yield point is judged. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 20, judgment is made as to whether or not the torque differential value G k ϑ₀ as shown in Fig. 9 and a threshold value MG x α for detecting an yield point hold a relation of G k ϑ₀ MG x α step 106 4A . When a false yield point is detected at point C₁, a relation of G k ϑ₂ MG x α holds as shown in Fig. 9, while a relation of G k ϑ₂ MG x α holds when a true yield point is detected at point C₂, thereby enabling judgment of the true yield point based on the judgment of step 106 4A. In the embodiment of Fig. 11, another threshold value, MG x β β 1 as shown in Fig. 12, that is different from the foregoing threshold value MG x α, is set to judge whether or not the torque differential value G k ϑ₂ and said threshold value MG x β hold a relation of G k ϑ₂ MG x β step 105 A . As is apparent from the figure, judgment becomes YES when the bolt is fastened down to a true yield point C₂. Fig. 13 shows another embodiment of judging the true or false of an yield point. As is apparent from Fig. 14, when a false yield point C₁ is detected, the differential value between points C₁ and D₁ tends to increase at least once, while this value tends to gradually decrease between points C₂ and D₂ when a true yield point C₂ is detected. In this embodiment, the true or false of a yield point is judged, taking notice of the above mentioned fact. Namely, the value n of a counter provided in CPU 10 for counting differential values between points C and D is set as n 0 step 106 6A , and then the value n is incremented by one step 106 6B to form a judgment on G k n x ϑ₀ G k n 1 xϑ In the step 106 6C, judgment on G k ϑ When the differential value G k ϑ When a true yield point is detected at point C₂, the differential values detected between points C₂ and D₂ decrease gradually as mentioned above. As a result, the counter value is increased to n ϑ₀ ϑ There is another method of detecting a true yield point as described below. As shown in Fig. 14, torque increase between C₂ and D₂ is gradual as compared with that between C₁ and D₁, that is, the torque increasing pattern during the angle ϑ₀ after appearance of a false yield point C₁ differs from that after appearance of a true yield point C₂. Therefore, if the torque increasing pattern during the angle ϑ₀ in relation to a true yield point C₂ standard torque increasing pattern is memorized in RAM 13 of Fig. 3 so that similarity between the measured torque increasing pattern during the angle ϑ₀ and the standard torque increasing pattern stored in RAM 13 will be obtained by a correlation method, judgment can be made as to whether the YES judgment of step 104 suggests a false yield point or a true one. The step 106 7A of Fig. 15 shows such judging process. Fig. 16 shows still another embodiment of this invention which judges the true or false of an yield point by turning a bolt by ϑ In the figure, steps 200, 201, 203 and 204 have the same contents as those of steps 100, 101, 103 and 104 of Fig. 1 respectively, and steps 209 and 210 have the same contents as those of steps 107 and 108 of Fig. 1. Fig. 17 shows the detail of diffrential calculation process in step 202, in which steps 202A, 202B to 202J have the same contents as those of 102A, 102B to 102J shown in Fig. 2. In this embodiment, there is provided a step number counter for counting the number of steps in the angle step of ϑ In this embodiment, when judgment of step 204 becomes YES by a false yield point C₁ or by a true yield point C₂ as shown in Fig. 19, judgment is made as to whether or not the bolt is turned by angle ϑ When the judgment of step 207 is YES, it is then judged whether the value N on the step number counter has reached the preset number step 208 . When the judgment of step 208 is YES, fastening of the bolt is stopped step 209 , and when it is NO, the step is returned to step 208B as shown in fig. 7. On the other hand, when the judgment of step 207 is NO, the step is returned to step 202A as shown in Fig. 17, resetting the step number counter accordingly. Now assume that the threshold value Ls in step 107 is set for MG x α as shown in Fig. 18. As indicated in Fig. 19, after a false yield point C₁ is detected, the torque gradient torque differential increases again, becoming greater than MG x α. Namely in the example of Fig. 18, when the bolt is turned until N becomes equal to 2, torque gradient G k 2ϑ On the other hand, after a true yield point is detected, torque differential value decreases as the bolt is fastened at an angle step of ϑ For example, if 3 is chosen for the count value N, the judgment of sep 208 becomes YES after procedures shown in steps 205 to 208 are repeated 3 times, causing bolt fastening to be stopped. In this example, therefore, the bolt fastening is continued when a false yield point C₁ is detected, and when a true yield point C₂ is detected, fastening of the bolt is stopped after the bolt has been turned by an angle N ϑ In Fig. 20, the threshold value Ls at step 207 is set for the torque gradient G k G k ₁, G k ₂ relative to point C C₁, C₂ step 207 2 . When a false yield point C₁ is detected, a part or all of the torque gradients detected over the angle range of N ϑs become larger than the threshold value G k , and hence, the judgment of step 208 does not indicate YES. On the other hand, when a true yield point is detected, each torque gradient detected in the angle range of N ϑ Fig. 22 shows another example 207 3 of step 207 in which the threshold value is set for MG x β. The coefficient β is smaller than 1 and different from the coefficient α. The threshold value Ls MBxβ, is set as shown in Fig. 23 for example, therefore. Fig. 24 shows still another example 207 4 of step 207 in which a torque gradient G k N 1 ϑ When a false yield point C₁ is detected, a condition where the torque gradient surely increases just after the detection, that is, a condition causing G k N.ϑ On the other hand, when a true yield point C₂ is detected, each torque gradient value detected over the angle N ϑ The number of times in step 208 is set large enough to allow the angle N ϑ Fig. 25 shows an axial force vs. elongation graph of M12 bolt 12mm in diameter , and also shows comparative fastening stop accuracies of the conventional bolt fastening method and the method of this invention, expressed by the dispersion of axial forces, 1 and 2 . The data of 2 are based on the embodiments of Figs. 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20 and 22 when ϑ₀ 20 , N ϑ In Fig. 25, the fastening stop accuracy 1 of the conventional method shows the case where a false yield point does not appear in which the dispersion of axial forces is 2.0 . On the other hand, in the case of subject invention, the dispersion of the axial force is within the range.of 1.2 , which suggests the fastening stop accuracy is excellent. In the subject invention, bolt is fastened down to its yield point and then further fastened by an angle ϑ₀ or N ϑ Fig. 26 shows another embodiment for judging the suitability of fastening condition. In this embodiment, conditions corresponding to step 100 as shown in fig. 1 are set step 300 , and then a setting procedure of fastening allowance is carried out as shown in step 301. As physical quantities variables with bolt fastening, a fastening turning angle and a fastening torque are detected in step 301, the upper and lower limits ϑ When it is judged at step 304 that fastening torque has reached the conformable torque, counting of fastening turning angle ϑ Fig. 27 shows the contents of differential calculation in step 307. Steps 307A to 307J in the figure have the same contents as those of steps, 102A to 102J, that are shown in Fig. 2, respectively. By such differential of the fastening turning angle when bolt fastening is stopped or when it ends and the upper and lower limits Tu and T The above mentioned upper and lower limits of the fastening turning angle, ϑu and ϑ The above mentioned values, ϑu, ϑ Upon completion of the setting procedure of the allowable range, a fastening start signal is issued from CPU10 of micro computer as shown in Fig. 3 to I O port 11, with the result that the motor 4 and the clutch 7 are energized by way of the drive circuit 12, thereby calculation, differential value G k showing torque gradient is obtained, and then renewal process of maximum differential value MG step 208 and yield point judgment process are executed step 209 . Steps 208 and 209, correspond to steps 103 and 104 of Fig. 1 respectively. When judgment of step 309 shows YES, the bolt is deemed to have yielded, causing its fastening to be stopped step 30U, and fastening torque yield torque Tp and fastening turning angle yield turning angle ϑp at the time of stop are stored in RAM 13 step 311 . When the bolt is properly fastened, the fastening torque Tp and the fastening turning angle ϑp at the yield point P indicate values within fastening allowable limits as shown in Fig. 27, but when bolt is not fastened properly for some reasons e.g. existence of dust, oil, etc. on bottom face of bolt , the torque may exceed the upper limit Tu prior to detecting yield point or even of yield point is detected, the torque Tp at the time may be smaller than the lower limit T In this embodiment, therefore, it is judged whether bolt has been properly fastened or not, as follows When judgment of step 309 indicates YES, comparative judgment is made on fastening torque Tp and fastening turn angle ϑp at the time of bolt stop which has been stored at step 311. Namely, comparative judgments on whether or not torque T at step 313 is smaller than lower limit T In step 319, it is judged whether flags, FA to FD are all zero. When the result of such judgment is YES, or when yield torque Tp and yield turning angle ϑp are within the allowable limits, bolt is deemed to have been properly fastened and statistical computation as shown in later mentioned step 320 is executed. When the result of such judgment is No, alarm indications by lamp, buzzer or CRT17 of Fig. 1 appear step 321 , thereby notifying the operator of improper fastening. Following execution of step 321, flags FA to FD are set as 0 step 322 , and fastening of another bolt is started. Descriptions of contents of step 320 are provided as follows In step 320, review of the allowable limits is conducted by the following statistical computations on the basis of fastening data at the time of stopping when bolt is properly fastened in this embodiment, torque at stop time T Tp, and turning angle at stop time ϑx ϑp. and also based on proper fastening data obtained at previous fastening. When the corrected values of the upper limit torque Tu, the lower limit torque T At the time when the first bolt is properly fastened, the average values T and ϑx obtained by above mentioned computations i and ii naturally show the stop torque and stop turning angle of the first bolt. Corrective procedures of step 320 are carried out whenever individual bolts are properly fastened. Therefore, if the allowable limits are set roughly at first, review and correction of the allowable limits are conducted whenever the bolt is fastened, and the optimum allowable limits are set automatically accordingly. Even when the bolt type is changed halfway, the allowable limit applicable to this bolt is automatically set. In other words, since this embodiment has learning functions for the allowable limits, such limits are automatically set so as to be suitable for the bolt to be fastened once rough allowable limit is set initially. Factors X₁ to X₄, used in the above iii computation are set as X₁ to X₄ 2 for instance when fastening stop ranges should be strictly controlled. When strict control is not necessary or when it is necessary to expedite pitch time, they are set as 3 to 5 for instance. In this embodiment, the fastening torque T and the fastening turn angle ϑx are used as physical quantities for setting the allowable limits. Sufficient practicable effects are obtainable by using either one of the two quantities. To ensure a highly accurate fastening effect, however, it is recommendable to set allowable limits using both quantities. While in this embodiment, bolt fastening is stopped when the torque differential G k becomes smaller than threshold value MG x α as shown in step 309, also applicable to this invention are a turning angle fastening method which stops fastening at the time when bolt has been turned by a preset angle fastening angle where bolt presumably enters its plastic range a little from turning angle ϑ Further, although in the embodiments shown in figs. 1, 16 and 26, the differential value that represents torque gradient is detected in such a way as shown in Fig. 2, torque gradient may be obtained by other methods. For instance, as shown in Fig. 29, average value S J of fastening torques sampled over a section of angle ϑs 6 samples in this figure is obtained every time when sampled number increases by one so that the torque gradient will be determined as the difference between average values S J and S J M , the latter being the average prior to m sampling step. Also the difference of torques between the beginning and end of angle section ϑs may be detected every time when sample number increases by one, to represent torque gradient. The value m in Fig. 29 is set over the range of While in each embodiment mentioned above, threshold values as shown in stops 104, 204 and 309 are set as MG x α, averages of maximum differential value MG, and the second largest and the third largest differential values may be obtained so that α multiples of said averages will be used as threshold values in steps 104, 204 and 309. Similarly, threshold values, MG x β, shows in Figs. 11 and 22 may be replaced by said averages multiplied by β.
