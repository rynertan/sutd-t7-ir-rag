## Description
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for use in reducing increased intracranial pressure in a warm blooded animal. Cerebral edema, which is a well known complication of various cerebral diseases, induces an increase in intracranial pressure due to compression of neighbouring brain tissues.Moreover, such increased intracranial pressure is known to adversely affect cerebral metabolism, result in disturbances of cerebral circulation and further aggravate cerebral edema. Therefore, the increased intracranial pressure exerts serious adverse effects on patients or is sometimes fatal to them. In this respect, a hypertonic solution 1000 1500 milliosmols kg H2O of glycerol or mannitol has been used for therapeutic treatment of patients suffering from increased intracranial pressure. The intravenous infusion of the hypertonic solution raises blood osmolality and creates an osmotic gradient between plasma and brain with resultant net removal of water from brain.Thus, the therapeutic effect of the hypertonic solution on the increased intracranial pressure is based on the hyperosmolar dehydrating effect and, therefore, in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effect, as much as 500 to 1500 ml man day of the hypertonic solution must be administered to patients. Such hypertonic solution is also disadvantageous in that its intravenous infusion often causes haematological abnormalities e.g., disturbance of water electorolite equilibrium, haemolysis, decrease in haematocrit level and is followed by a rebound increase in the intracranial pressure to levels higher than those that existed before therapy. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition adapted for oral administration to a warm blooded animal. Another object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for use in reducing or treating increased intracranial pressure in a warm blooded animal, including man, in need of such reduction of intracranial pressure. Other object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition which enables us to reduce increased intracranial pressure without haematological abnormalities, r rebound increase in said pressure and other untoward side effects as seen in the hypertonic solution of glycerol or mannitol. Still other object is to provide a pharmaceutical composition which is useful to treat a warm blooded animal suffering from a disease or condition attributable to increased intracranial pressure.Further object of the invention will be apparent from the following description and claims. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is concerned with tablets each comprising, as an active ingredient, a propanol derivative of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R is alkyl of one to 4 carbon atoms and Ring A is phenyl, halogenophenyl, methylphenyl or trifluoromethylphenyl, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.Said active ingredient, i.e., the propanol derivative I or its salt, can be used in combination with an inert diluent, a disintegrator and a lubricant, and if required, may be further used together with a binder. The propanol derivative I of the present invention shows a significant decrease in intracranial pressure at a remarkably low dose such as 0.1 2 mg kg of body weight day.Representative examples of such compound include those of the formula I in which R is alkyl having one to 4 carbon stoms e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl , and Ring A is phenyl, methylphenyl e.g., 2 methylphenyl , chlorophenyl e.g., 2 chlorophenyl, 3 chlorophenyl, 4 chlorophenyl , fluorophenyl e.g., 2 fluorophenyl, 3 fluorophenyl, 4 fluorophenyl or trifluoromethylphenyl e.g., 3 trifluoromethylphenyl .Among these compounds, preferred group of compounds are those of the formula I in which R is methyl and Ring A is phenyl, chlorophenyl or fluorophenyl. More preferred group of compounds are those of the formula I in which R is methyl and Ring A is phenyl, 2 chlorophenyl, 2 fluorophenyl or 3 fluorophenyl, and the most preferred compound is 1 4 acetamido 2 methoxyphenoxy 3 r4 3 fluorophenyl piperazino 2 propanol. All of these propanol derivatives I and a process for preparation thereof have already been disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication unexamined No. 21127 1978. The propanol derivative I may be employed either as the free base or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of the propanol derivative I includes, for examples, inorganic acid addition salts such as hydrochloride, phosphate, nitrate and sulfate and organic acid addition salts such as acetate, lactate, citrate, fumarate, maleate, glycinate, aspartate, methanesulfonate and benzoate. The amount of the propanol derivative I or its salt to be contained in each tablets of the invention may vary depending on the age, weight and condition of patients and the particular diseases to be treated. In general, however, suitable amount of the propanol derivative I or its salt to be used is about 5 to about 50 mg, especially about 10 to about 50 mg, per each tablet. The tablets of the present invention can be made by direct compression, i.e., by the steps of mixing the propanol derivative I or its salt with the inert diluent, the disintègrator and the lubricant, and compressing the mixture into a suitable form of tablets. Alternatively, said tablets may be made according to a granulation method, i.e., by the steps of granulating the mixture of the propanol derivative I or its salt, the disintegrator and the inert diluent with the aid of the binder, adding the lubricant thereto and then compressing the mixture into tablets. Various disintegrators and lubricants can be used in making the tablets of the invention. For example, carboxymethylcelllulose, calcium carboxymethylcellulose, alginic acid or its salt are preferably used as the disintegrator, and suitable examples of the lubricant include stearic acid, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate and talc. On the other hand, the inert diluent which can be used in the invention includes, for example, calcium citrate, calcium phosphate, sucrose, dextrose, lactose, mannitol and sorbitol.Starch and crystalline cellulose may be used either as the disintegrator or the inert diluent because they have both functions. The binder which may be optionally used to impart a pertinent cohesiveness to the tablet includes, for example, natural polymers such as gelatin, dextrin or acacia, synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone and cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropylcellulose, methylcellulose or sodium caboxymethylcellulose. Compression of these ingredients into tablets, granulation as well as compression of the granules of said ingredients can be readily accomplished by the use of conventional tablet machines, mixing machines for granulation, kneader, granulator, dryer, etc. Moreover, each tablets of the present invention may be formed into various shapes and sizes. For example, they may be either discoid, round, oval or oblong in shape. Each tablets should weigh about 50 to about 500 mg, especially about 70 to about 500 mg, and have the hardness of about 4 to about 20 kg when measured by Schleuniger s hardness tester Model 2E. The tablets of the present invention for use in the therapeutic treatment of increased intracranial pressure should release the active ingredient, i.e., the propanol derivative I or its salt, from the tablet matrix as efficiently as possible to allow for its rapid dissolution after oral administration thereof by patients and should preferably disintegrate within about 10 minutes, especially within about 2 minutes,when tested by tablet disintegration apparatus.For this purpose, it is suitable to use about one to about 40 w w of the disintegrator, about 0.3 to about 2 w w of the lubricant and 0 to about 10 w w of the the binder.Particularly, in making the tablets according to the direct compression method, it is preferred to use about one to about 30 w w , more preferably about 5 to about 15 w w , of the disintegrator. On the other hand, when the tablets are made according to the wet granulation method, it is preferred to use about 3 to about 40 w w , more preferably about 5 to about 25 w w , of the disintegrator. The use of the binder is not critical in the invention if the tablets are made according to the direct compression method. In addition, even in making the tablets according to the wet granulation method, the use of too much binder will make a hard tablet which will not disintegrate easily. Preferred amount of the binder to be used from this point of view is about one to about 4 w w .The inert diluent is used in an amount sufficient to bring the tablet up to 100 w w , i.e., to increase the bulk in order to make the tablet a practical size for compression. Such amount of the diluent may be readily decided on the weight of each tablet to be made as well as on the amount of each one of the active ingredient, disintegrator, lubricant and binder used. The pharmaceutical composition i.e., tablets of the present invention can be used for therapeutic treatment or prognosis of a warm blooded animal, including man, suffering from increased intracranial pressure due to various cerebral diseases such as cerebral infarction, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral embolism, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, head injury, cerebral tumor, cerebral edema, encephalomyelitis and the like. The propanol derivative I may be also used to ameliorate such various cerebral diseases as mentioned above. Further, since the propanol derivative I has a potent cerebral blood flow increasing activity in addition to its effect on the intracranial pressure, it can also be used to improve the cerebral circulation, especially in ischemic areas in brain. The propanol derivative I shows significant decrease in intracranial pressure even when administered at such a remarkably low dose as 0.5 mg kg of body weight said therapeutic effect lasts for a long period of time such as for more than 5 6 hours and its use is not associated with rebound increase in intracranial pressure. Unlike those of the hypertonic solutions of glycerol or mannitol, the therapeutic effect of the propanol derivative I of the present invention is not ascribable to the cerebral dehydrating effect. The propanol derivative I may be used for the treatment or prophylaxis of increased intracranial pressure during and after brain surgical operation.Moreover, the propanol derivative I may be used for improving impaired consciousness, nervous disturbance and subjective symptoms e.g , headache, nausea, vomiting which are attributed to the cerebral diseases such as those mentioned hereinbefore. Further, whereas it is known that cerebral edema induces an increase in intracranial pressure and increased intracranial pressure serves to cause a build up of edema which in turn impairs cerebral circulation, the propanol derivative I can interrupt such vicious cycle of cerebral diseases because of its potent intracranial pressure lowering effect and ameliorate the cerebral circulatory impairment. The toxicity of the propanol derivative I of the invention is low.For example, when the acute toxicity of a test compound is estimated a week after oral administration thereof to male mice, LD50 of 1 4 acetamido 2 methoxyphenoxy 3 04 3 fluorophenyl piperazinog 2 propanol of the invention is about 1500 mg kg. Concomitantly, the propanol derivative I of the present invention is prepared in accordance with the method described in Japanese Patent Publication unexamined No.21127 1978, i.e., by reacting a 3 4 acylamino 2 methoxyphenoxy 1,2 epoxypropane with a piperazine derivative of the formula EMI9.1 wherein Ring A is the same as defined above.Example 1 25 g of 1 4 acetamido 2 methoxyphenoxy 3 t4 3 fluorophenyl piperazino 2 propanol hydrochloride, 135.2 g of calcium citrate, 18 g of carboxymethylcellulose and 1.8 g of magnesium stearate were mixed thoroughly.
