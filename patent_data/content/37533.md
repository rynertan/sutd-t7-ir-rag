A valve wholly made of a synthetic resin and being of the type wherein a body 1 and a flanged body cap 5 are coupled to each other by screwing a cap nut 6 to the peripheral surface of the body 1 . The body cap 5 consists of a tubular first element 9 with a disengagement preventing portion formed at the end to be connected to the body 1 . An annular groove 9a is formed inwardly of the disengagment preventing portion. A ring like element 10 having a small diameter portion 10a adapted to be fitted into the annular groove 9a of the first element 9 and a large diameter por tion 10b adapted to contact the outer surface of the disengagement preventing portion of the first element 9 is cut at one side in this circumferential direction to form two cut ends 101, 102 . The first element 9 is coupled to the ring like element 10 whereby the ring like element forms the seat of the body cap.
