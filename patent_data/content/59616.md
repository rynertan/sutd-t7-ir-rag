# Removal of metal catalysts from process streams.

## Abstract
Organic sulfur compounds containing a carbon sulfur double bond are used to remove homogeneous catalyst group VIII metals from chemical process streams. 2 to 12 moles of the sulfur compound is added per mole of group VIII metal, the reaction mixture is warmed to 50 100 C for 2 10 hours and cooled to 0 5 C, and the resulting metal complex is separated.
