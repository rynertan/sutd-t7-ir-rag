# Improvements in or relating to tube couplings.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to tube couplings in which a hollow body 10 has an opening 11 to receive a tube 15 and a collet 32 having resilient arms 33 encircling the tube 15 in the body 10 to grip the tube 15 . An annular cam 22 is mounted in the body 10 and has a tapered internal cam surface 31 en gaged by the collet arms 33 which reduces towards the open end 12, 13 of the body 10 to increase compression of the arms 33 against the tube 15 as the collet 32 is drawn towards the open end 12 of the body 10 to lock the tube 15 in the body 10 . The cam member 27 is mounted in the body 10 for axial adjustement with respect to the body 10 , for ex ample by a screw engagement 28 in the body 10 , to enable the cam 27 to be adjusted with respect to the collet 32 to vary the compressive force applied to the resilient arms 33 .
