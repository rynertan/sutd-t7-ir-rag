# Vehicle with combination speed and direction control and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
The vehicle comprises a combination speed and direction control which includes an actuating lever 16 mounted on the tractor chassis, and control cables extending between the lever 16 and the clutch 32 and between the lever 16 and the transmission 36 forward reverse shift linkage. Forward movement of the lever 16 shifts the transmission 36 to the forward position and releases the clutch 32 to engage the driving and driven pulleys 212, 202 . Returning of the lever 16 to a neutral position disengages the clutch 32 and moves the transmission to neutral. Movement of the lever 16 in a reverse direction shifts the transmission 36 into reverse gear, and couples the pulleys 212, 202 together. The lever 16 is also coupled to the vehicle brake. Application of the brake causes the lever 16 , and the transmission 36 and clutch 32 to move to neutral. Movement of the lever 16 to neutral, in addition to disengaging the clutch 32 and moving the transmission 36 to the neutral position, applies the brake.
