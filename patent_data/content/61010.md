# Process for forming refractory metal layers on ceramic substrates.

## Abstract
A process for forming a substantially glass free surface on screened refractory metallurgy areas on a ceramic substrate, wherein a thin layer of Pd is deposited over the metallurgy areas and the metallurgy areas subsequently sintered causing the surface refractory metal particles to be fused into a substantially solid metallurgy layer under the catalyzing influence of the Pd.
