AMIDOXIME DERIVATIVES, PROCESSES FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF AND USES THEREFOR The present invention relates to novel amidoxie derivatives. processes for the preparation thereof and uses therefor. i4ore particularly the present invention relates to novel compoLr ds of the general formula . EMI1.1 wherein R1 is H, an alkyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms1 phenyl, d heterocyclic ring structure of 5 to 8 atoms containing one or more nitrogen or oxygen atoms or combinations thereof or a bicyclic condensed ring system optionally containing at least one heterocyclic ring as defined, which groups may each be optionally substituted by one or more.groups as hereinafter defined and enumerated, or R1 is a monomer unit repeated many times forming a polymer or macromolecule, with itself and or other monomers and the remainder of formula 1 attached to R1 are repeating pendants of the said polymer. R2 is a mono or bicyclic heterocyclic radical containing at least two nitrogen atoms of cyclic carbonic acid imide derivative structures, which is also optionally substituted by one or more groups as hereinafter defined. R3 and R4 are independently H, or an alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or one, but not both, isEMI1.2 and the other, H, wherein R5 or are alkyls of 2 to 5 carbon atoms optionally substituted by K1, or a phenyl optionally substituted by R1 or R5 or R6 is combined with R1 to jointly form cyclic imidoximes or imidedioximes. The novel process according to present invention comprises reacting an amidoxime of the structure EMI1.3 with a compound of cyclic carbonic acid imide halides refcrred to as the formula R2 Hol wherein R1, R2 and R4 are as defined herein to form a compound of the formulaEMI2.1 As is known, the amidoxime function contains an amine or amine derivative and an isonitroso group on a carbon radical, e.g.EMI2.2 It has now been found that the isonitroso group of amidoximes in general will react via a nucleophilic displacement of a halide radical of a compound designated for this purpose as R2 Hal, wherein R2 is as defined herein andHal designates the reactive leaving halogen group to give compound of the general formula 1, and thus a whole new line of heretofore unknown amidoxime derivatives can be produced according to the present invention. As far as can be determined, the prior art does not teach or suggest the presently claimed reaction of amidoximes and compounds of the formulaR2 Hal and thus the presently claimed process also constitutes a major advance in the art. The reaction kinetics and degradation mechanism of amidoximes, however, with other electrophilic reagents e.g. acyl, phosphonyl and sulfuryl halides is described, and has been shown to be significantly different than the reaction of electrophilics with oximes, aldoximes arid hydroxamic acid J.D.Aubart and R.F. Hudson, Chemical Conmunications, 1969, p. 13t2, and Rrr. Hudson and R.C. Woodcock, Leibigs Ann. Chem. 1978, p. 176 186 . This difference is attributed to the amine function promoting intramolecular catalysis. Thus, the already patented product of triazine derivativeS with aldoximes and their use as herbicides Brit. Pat. 1318514, May 31, 1973 is basically different than that of the present invention. In light of the large number of known amidoxire functions, as enumerated, e.g. in the article The Chemistry of Amidoximes and Related Conound, F. Eloy and R. Lenaers, Chem.

It should be emphasized that the substituents of R2 are not always defined by R2 Hal. In effect, reactive substituents of R2 eg. CL, or NH2 may be further reacted to a new product, wherein both the initial reactant and final product are defined by formula 1. Thus, R2 is derived from cyclic carbonic acid imide halide structures, some preferred compounds are those in which R2 is a an optionally substituted radical of a six membered ring containing at least two nitrogen atoms or b an optionally substituted bicyclic condensed ring system containing at least ore six membered ring of at least two nitrogen atoms, e.g. a halogen substituted quinoxaline.

As can be learned from said Chew. Review article ibid., many amidoxime functions are already known and have been prepared and accordingly R1 could have any of the values mentioned for R in Tables 2, 3 and 4 of said article without interferring with the process of the present invention, and thus compounds according to formula I wherein R1 can be e.g. any of said values are included in the scope of the present invention. With regard to the compounds of Table 4 of said article, it is to be noted that the present invention also includes, as amidoxime derivatives, which can be reacted with R2 Hal compounds to fonn the novel compounds of formula I, imidoximes and imidedioximes such as those having the formulas EMI8.1 When said abcve mentioned amidoxime derivatives are reacted with compounds there are preferrably produced compounds according to formula 1, wherein a R3 is H and R4 isEMI9.1 and R6 together with R1 form structures of the formulaEMI9.2 in which R 2 is H or R2 or b R3 is li, R4 isEMI9.3 end R5 together with R1 fonn structures of the formulaEMI9.4 Preferrably in said compounds R2 is a substituted triazinyl, pyrimidyl or quinoxaline radical as defined. The invention also provides compounds of formula I having the structureVIII EMI10.1 wherein each R 2 is independently either R2 or H, R2 is a triazinyl or pyrimidal radical and q is 2, 3 or 6. Under most conditions of amidoxime reaction with R2 Hal compounds the isonitroso groups were found to react more readily than the amine group.This difference in reactivity enables the selective substitution of the isonitroso and amine functions. Thus, after O substitution with an P2 Hal compound the free amine may be reacted with other P2 Hal compounds, isocyanates, thioisocyanates, benzoyl chloride formaldehyde, carbon di sulfide, hydrazi ne, etc. Alternatively, the amidoxime compound prior to reaction with R2 lal compounds may be N substituted with alkyl or aryl radicals, through C, O, N,P, S atoms. The substituted groups may affect the reactivity of the amine function by any of the well known mechanisms e.g. electron attraction or repulsion or by steric or electrostatic effects . Thus, if the amine function is substituted to form an imidoxime the reactivity of the nitrogen radical is enhanced under basic conditions and may compete with the isonitroso group during the reaction with R2 Hal. included within the scope of this invention are such N substituted amidoximes including the class of imidoximes and their reaction products with R2 Hal. In addition, compounds containing both an oxime and amidoxime, e.g.EMI10.2 a phenyl ansinoglyoxlme re included within the scope of the invention This invention is not limited by the method of preparing the amidoxime compounds. Synthesis procedures, however, way include A The redaction of hydroxylamine with compounds containing nitrides, amides, thioamides, amidine hydrochlorides and iminoethers B The reduction of nitrolic acids and oxyamidoximes C Reaction of ammonia with hydroximic acid chlorides, oximinoethers and glyoxime peroxides and D Reaction of formamidoxime with aromatic aldehydes. If R1 and R2 are mutually substituted with amidoxime functions, then polymeric structures of the formula are fonned.EMI11.1 If R1 is substituted by a polymer, then structures of the following formula may form EMI11.2 wherein M1, M2, Rl9, R2, R3R4 have the previously described meaning.if, in addition, R2 is optionally substituted on an amidoxime function of another polymer, the polymeric material is also crosslinked, i.e., for example EMI11.3 In one preferred cmbodiment, the polymeric pendents , R3 and R4 will be H, and R2 a triazinyl or pyrimidyl yroup containing reactive halogens and and M2 will both be olefinic.

The novel compounds of the present invention have many uses. For example, the low molecular weight compounds may be used to modify fibers, particles, weaves, nets and clothes containing amidoxime, oxime, cyano, hydroxy, ermine, carboxyl, thiol and sulphonamide groups, such as acrylics, cellulosics, wool and nylons, if R2 is substituted with reactive halogens. If the compounds are pol meric pendents, where R2 is a reactive dye pendent, then this invention may he used for dyeing nitrile containing fibers or clothes. If theR2 group is bound to two different chains via amidoxime groups, then by this invention acrylonitrile fibers are crosslinked and strengthened.If R2 contains further reactive groups e.g. halogens for binding biological materials such as enzymes, hormones, lectins, antibodies, antigens, arr no acids, nucleotides, whole cells and cell fragments and other biological molecules or catalytic agents, or functional groups such as amino to which cells may adhere and grow, then this invention may be used to produce films, particles or fibers small configurations dense or porous , the fibers way be bundled or singular, or as a fabric or cloth useful in flow cytomctry, phagocytosis, immunological markers, affinity labelling trucer studies, solid phase radioimmunoassay clinical test kits, affinity chromatograph, enzyme reactors HPLC and substrates for the production of polypeptides and or polynucleotides and as structures where upon cells may adhere for cell culture devices. In addition, if R2 contains reactive groups for binding hydrophilic polymers, then antistatic and hydrophilic properties may be imparted to hydrophobic films, fibers and particles. Such coated materials may also find application in affinity chromatography, enzyme reactors and substrates for polypeptides and or polynucleotides by binding reagents or enzymic or biospecific adsorbents through the groups on the hydrophilic polylners. Iii the case of affinity chromatography, some hydrophilic coatings may minimize nonspecific adsorption. Thus, if the amidoxime of formula II pg. 21 is already a polyamidoxime of the type described, e.g. in Brit. Pat. 786,960 R2 lSal compounds may also be reacted as described above and, therefore, polyacrylonitrile PAN fibers may be partially or completely modified to form fibers containing amidoxime groups on a polymeric backbone. In this way, PAN fibers may be dyed with reactive dyes because R2 Hal derivatives form a large class of such reactive dyes S.F.Beech Fiber Reactive Dyes , 1970, Logos Press Ltd . Alternatively, the product of a polyamidoxime and an P2 Hal compound may be subsequently reacted with a water attracting monomer or polymeric substances to impart antistatic or hydrophilic properties to the PAN fiber. Furthermore. fireretarding, softening or antistatic agents to which a R2 Hal function is attached may react with the amidoxime modified PAN textile to result i permanent fire retarding, softening or antistatic effects. For example, PAN fibers may be reacted with hydroxylamine under controlled conditions that convert the surface nitrile groups to amidoxime functions.The fiber may then be dyed with, for example, triazinyl, pyrimidyl or quinoxaline type reactive dye. Alternatively, the amidoxime group may be reacted with 2,4,6 trichloro 1,3,5 triazine or tetrachloro pyrimidine under conditions where only one or two reactive chloro has reacted. The remaining chloro groups may subsequently be reacted with a water attracting monomer or polymeric substances e.g.polyvinyl alcohol to impart antistatic or hydrophilic properties to the PAN fiber. It should be noted that while PAN materials are given as an example, any polymeric material may be modified by the process of this invention if it contains as pendants or incorporates withing the backbone an amidoxime orR2 Hal group. In light of the above, the present invention also provides methods for preparing novel fibers, both dense and porous,fabrics of such fibers and particles, both dense and porous. The porosity may vary from 1Z to 99 of the total volume. The preferred range depending on the application.And the particles and or fibers may be transparent, translucent or opague in the dry or wet state. Thus, substrates such as fibers and particles composed of polymers con taining nitrile pendants ex. polyacrylonitrile and its copolylllers can be modified by the sequence taught in this invention, to give the composition of matter also claimed. In effect, hydroxylamine converts the nitriles to amidoxime functions and the said amidoxime functions are then reacted with R2 Hal compounds. The resultant material contains Structures described with regard to formula I.For the example of polyacrylonitrile after the hydroxylamine has reacted with cyanuric chloride or, ror example, a mono all yl amino or anilino dichloro triazinyl, the structure formed is EMI21.1 where R50 is CL if P2 Hal is cyanuric chloride or P50 is alkyl amino or anilino if R2 Hal is 2 alkyl amino, 4,6 dichloro triazinyl or 2 anilino, 4,6 dichloro triazinyl, respectively. The resultant materials may them be substituted further on the unreacted halogen or reactive groups leg. NH2 or OH of the triazinyl substituent.For example, the above product may then be reacted with biological materials or alternatively water soluble reactive polymers such as polyethylenimine, polyvinylamine, polyvinyl alcohol or a water soluble polysaccharide, thus, in effect, coating and binding to the fiber or particle or films of these materials.Further reactions may then be carried on the uncoated or coated fibers or particles to bind lectins, hormones, enzymes, antibiotics, peptides, anmoacids, nucleotides, etc. from whole cells, cell fragments, from microbial, fungi, yeas algea, plant or animal sources. In another variation, cells, cellular fragments may be reacted directly to the compounds of formula I through the unreacted halogen without the intermediate hydrophilic polymer layer. In this and the abode cases, the substrates, such as fibers or particles may be used in affinity chromatograpily, enzyme reactors and supports for the synthesis of polypeptides and polynucleotides, as well as supports for cells in culture devices.In the latter case, cells may be physically adsorbed and not chemically bound. To achieve such an adsorption the unreacted halogen may be reacted with compounds containing functional groups that are known to adsorb cellular.structures, as for example, quaternary ammonium groups. The fibers or particles, which may be modified by the process of this invention may have diameters varying from .lp to 5mm, but the preferred range varies with the application. For example, for the tagging of cells with fluorescent or chromophoric material a range of .1 to 1.0 may be preferrable, while for an enzyme reactor the range of 200 500u is preferrable and so on.The particles or and fibers, or substrates in general, may be dense or porous, wherein the pore size may be from 10AO to 10000A including the class of particles called macroreticulate and porosity or pore volume may vary from 1 to 99t. The fibers may have a similar range of porosity and as an example of the porous fiber, is the Bayer acrylonitrile fiber DunovaW The fibers may be of any length lp to 10 kilometers. Thus, any nitrile containing polymer, which may pe formed into fibers or particles is suitable for further modification by the process of this invention. In certain applications porous particles or fibers may be more desirable than dense materials. For example, in enzyme reactions a higher quantity of enzymers per gram of material is achieved with porous fibers and particles and this is reflected in a more favorable economics of the processes. In the application to affinity, chromatography dense structures with a layer of a hydrophilic polymer may be bound through the R2 Hal group to the support.The molecules with the required biological affinity may then be bound. On the other hand, support materials for pulypeptide or polynucleotide synthesis require high reactive group capacity, and thus, porous materials are favC.rd. The fiber nay be in the found of individual fibers or a woven or non woven fabric. The fabric may be a monofilament or multifilament and the filamcnts may be arranged in thU fabric as a plain weave, twill weave calendered, half gauze imitation, reverse plain.dutch weave, leno weave full or half gauze without limiting t to these arranyenents. The apertures in the fabric may vary between 0.1 to 5000 , but in most applications the desired range will be between 4 to 900, though lower ranges may also be very desirable in some cases. The aperture size may affect the kinetics of a process based on this invention.For example, if a solution of substrate is passed through the net or fabric in an enzyme reactor under pressure, apertures less than 10 will minimize the unstirred layer affect1 which often is the rate limiting step with fast enzymatic process carried out on particles or solid substrates.Thus, apertures less than 4p may be desirable, especially for relatively dilute solutions. If, on the other hand, highly concentrated viscose solutions are used, larger apertures are required to minimize clogging. The fabric may be arranged for a process as layers placed on top of each other to form a depth filter on a support, and pressure applied from the top to tIIe bottom, or placed in a plate and frame device or in a filter press, or wound in a spiral wound configuration. The solution to be treated may then pass transversely through the fabric or fabric layers or may pass over the surface and between the layers of the fabric. The fibers may also be placed in a bundle of any size and placed in a holder where the ends are potted.The solution to be treated may then pass over the surface and between the individual fibers. The term fiber is meant to include configurations without or with a linen, wherein the latter is known as a hollow fiber wherein solutions may be passed through the fiber. In the case of particles, the said particles may be placed in a column or in a reaction vessel and used under flow through conditions in a continuous process or batch operations. In one embodiement of the invention, the starting materials particles or fibers are treated for 3 min to 48 hours at temperatures of 0 to 95 C with an aqueous solution of hydroxylamine .2 to 80 , but preferrably 1 to 20 , which has a pi value of 2 to 11, but preferrably of 6 to 7 adjusted with sodium carbonate . The efficiency of conversion of nitrile to amidoxime groups can be from .5 to about 8 and pre.errable in the range of 1.0 to 22 , for example, for polymers containing 80 or more of acrylonitrile unitS.The particles or fibers may then be placed in an aqueous solution suspension or an organic solution ex. acetone, dioxane, N,N dimethyl formamide, chloroform, methylene chloride, N methypyrrolidone of an R Hal compound.For example, cyanuric chloride is a suspension of 0.5 to 5 parts in H20, or 2 diethylamino 4,6 dichlorotriazine in acetone water 80 20. The reaction mixture is kept below 10 C i.e. 0 C in order to prevent hydrolysis of the cyanuric chloride the pH value is approximately between 4 to 10, but preferrably 6 8 and the reaction time can be from 10 seconds to 5 hours.If tetrochloro pyrimidine is used, then higher temperatures, longer reaction times and higher pH s may be necessary to achieve the same degree of substitution. If other P2 Hal reagents are used, different reaction times may be necessary. One preferred R2 Hal is an amino or anilino dichlorotriazinyl compounds. When this invention is practiced on solid polymeric supports containing nitrile function as previously specified , the amount of reactive halogens in most cases Cl introduced prior to binding biological materials or syninetic polymers, may vary between .05 to 3.5 meq gr, but preferrably between .2 to 2.5 meq gr dry basis . As stated, the general novel process of the present invention comprises reacting an amidoxime of the structure IIEMI24.1 with a compound of the formula P2 Hal to form a compound of the formula IEMI24.2 wherein R1, R2, P3 and R4 are as hereinbefore generally and specifically defined and as exemplified in the examples hereinafter.

As realized, the choice of the reacting amidoxime derivative of formula II and the P2 Hal compound will determine the nature of the final novel compound of formula I, which is formed. Thus, in several preferred embodiments the reacting amidoxime is acetamidoxime or benzamidoxime. In another preferred embodiment a diamidoxime of the formulaEMI25.1 is reacted with a compound of the formula R2 Hal, wherein R is a phenyl group optionally substituted by at least one C1 group or a radical of the formula CH2n and n l or 6.

Similarly a polymeric compound of formula IX, as defined, hereinbefore can be manufactured by reacting an olefinic polymer containing nitrile groups with a hydroxylamine and then subsequently reacting the product thereof with R2 Hal. In said proces for producing polymeric compounds formula IX, preferrablyR2 Hal is cyanuric chloride or a mDnO substituted derivative such as monoamine dichloro triazine derivative or tetrachloropyrimidine or its derivatives containing at least two active halogens, and the nitrile containing polymer may be polyacrylonitrile or a copolymer of polyacrylonitrile or polymeth acrylonitrile with a vinyl acetate, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, allyl bromide, acrylic acid or allyl sulfonate, wherein the comonomer may be chosen from additional compounds. Once said products are produced, wherein the compounds of formula T ate in fact polymeric compounds of formula IX as defined, the present invention can preferrably include the further possible steps of either a reacting a water soluble polymer containing amino or hydroxyl groups with unreacted halogen substituents of the R12 radical of compounds of formula ly, wherein the water soluble polymer is preferrably selected from polyethyleneimine, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylamine, or water soluble polysaccharides or b reacting an enzyme with unreacted halogen substituents of the R12 radical of compounds of formula IX or c reacting a lectin, a4rmone, an amino acid, a polysaccharide7 a polypeptide, an antibody, an antigen,.a whole cell or cellular fragments with unreacted halogen substituents of the R12 radical cf compounds of formula lx or d reacting the unreactive halogen with primary or secondary low molecular weight amines or alkyl amino or anilino derivatives containing amines or quaternary ammoniums, or with polymers as in a and using such materials for cellular adsorption in cell culture devices. The possibility of carrying out these further preferred process steps is preferrably made possible by carrying out the initial reaction of P2 Hal compound with the amidoxime under conditions whereby the reaction occurs with one or two halogens of R2 Hal leaving 0.1 to 3.0 meq qr remaining of halogen substituents of R2 unreacted. In another preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention for producing polymeric compounds of formula IX the reacted R2 Hal compound is a reactive dye based on symmetrical and unsymmetrical triazines and diazines touch as pyrimidines, pyridazines, pyrazines, quinoxalines, quinazolines and benzothiazoles.

Similarly when a compound of formula I is prepared, as described, from an olefinic polymer containing nitrile groups and the original nitrile polymer is in the form os a fiber 1 to lmm in diameter, a fabric of such fibers or a p article 1 to 5mm in diameter, then said compound can be put to several additional uses by carrying out the further steps of a reacting a water soluble polymer containing amino or hydroxyl groups with unreacted halogen substituents of the R12 radical of compounds of formula IX, wherein the fiber, fabric or particle is made hydrophilic or b reacting an enzyme with unreacted halogen substituents of the P12 radical of compounds of formula IX or c reacting a lectin, a polysaccharide, a hormone, an amino acid, a polypeptide, an antibody, an antigen, a whole cell or cellular fragments with unreacted halogen substituents of the R12 radical of compounds of formula IX.
