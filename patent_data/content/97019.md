# Sampling apparatus in a liquid analyzer.

## Abstract
Liquid sampling apparatus in a liquid analyzer includes a hollow sample intake tube 10 that has an inlet port adapted to receive sample material to be analyzed, and is mounted on a support 40 for movement about a fixed pivot 46 between a reset position and at least two sample intake positions 10A, 10B, 10C . Also mounted on the support is a manually manipulable drive link assembly 72 that carries a slider 82 that receives the intake tube 10 . A track 50 on the support guides movement of the link assembly 72 to slide the slider 82 along the intake tube between a reset position in which the inlet port is aligned with a waste receptacle 24 , a first sample position in which the inlet port 136A extends forward of the slider 82 for insertion into a sample container, and a second sample position in which the inlet port 136B is housed in coupling structure carried by the slider 82 and presented to the operator for connection of a transfer device such as a capillary tube.
