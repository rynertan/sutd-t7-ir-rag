# Initially erasable ink composition for a ball point writing instrument.

## Abstract
An ink composition for a ball point writing instrument characterized by initial erasability by ordinary pencil erasers and which thereafter develops permanence. The ink includes an elastomer selected from the group consisting of natural rubbers, synthetic rubbers and mixtures thereof, pigment, and a solvent system for said elastomer. The elastomer is present in the range of about 18 28 and the pigment is present in the range of about 10 22 . The solvent system comprises a volatile component present in the range of about 8 30 and having a boiling point less than about 180 C and an essentially non volatile component which is predominantly a low viscosity hydrocarbon oil, having a boiling point less than about 300 C and greater than about 180 C being present in the range of about 21 to 50.5 . The solvent system may also include up to 15 of a non volatile high viscosity material having a boiling point greater than about 300 C. Percentages are by weight of the ink.
