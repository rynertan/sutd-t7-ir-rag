# Coal gasification burner and apparatus.

## Abstract
A burner 10 for the partial oxidation of a particulate fuel to form a gaseous product, comprises a burner body 21 having a mixing compartment 26 and a discharge end and conduits 29, 27 for supplying a particulate fuel, such as coal slurry, and oxygen to the mixing compartment, the burner having an end face 24 with a discharge lip 23 in the end face defining a nozzle 22 for discharge of combustion mixture from the mixing compartment 26 . An annular manifold 37 is disposed adjacent the end face and extends circumferentially of the discharge lip 23 , and a conduit 39 supplies pressurised steam to the manifold. The manifold 37 has a constricted opening 42, 43 positioned to deliver a pressurised stream of steam from the manifold generally transversely of the burner end face 24 towards the dis charge lip 23 , whereby to form a dynamic fluid shield across the burner face to preclude slag or ash particles from contacting the face and building up any solid accumulation.
