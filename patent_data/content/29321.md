# Hydrogenation catalyst material, a precursor thereto, method of making the latter and use of the catalyst for selective hydrogenation.

## Abstract
A catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of highly unsa turated hydrocarbons, e.g. acetylene, in the presence of less unsaturated hydrocarbons, e.g. ethylene, comprises palladium supported on a calcined refractory material comprising a calci um aluminate cement having a CA Al ratio of 1 4 to 1 10, the average depth of penetration of the palladium into the catalyst pieces being less than 300 Âµm. Preparation of this catalyst by forming shaped pieces from a composition containing alumina and calcium aluminate cement, calcining said shaped pieces and impregnating said calcined shaped pieces with a reducible paliadium compound.
