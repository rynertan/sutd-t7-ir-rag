The binary adder which is the subject of the present invention takes advantage of the easy access to all of the circuit s internal nodes which is possible on a large scale integrated LSI chip. Redundant logic elements have been essentially eliminated and the circuit is also configured to permit layout in a regular and compact array for an N bit adder. The result is a reduced device count, compact size, and faster addition speed. There now follows a detailed description which is to be read with reference to the accompanying drawings of a prior art adder apparatus and of two embodiments of the present invention it is to be clearly understood that these embodiments have been selected for description to illustrate the invention by way of example and not by way of limitation. In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 illustrates the circuit diagram of a traditional 4 bit carry look ahead adder with separate logic for the carry and sum paths Figures 2A and 2B illustrate a 2 to 1 multiplexer implemented with MOSFETS for use in an adder Figure 3 is a circuit diagram of an apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention and Figure 4 is a circuit diagram of a further apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In Figure 1 therefisillustrated the circuit diagram of a traditional 4 bit carry look ahead adder which is capable of anticipating the carry signal across multiple bits of addition. This is generally done in powers of two, such as four or sixteen, and permits the carry signal to skip across groups of bits so that the addition can be speeded up by powers of two. Separate logic is provided for the carry path 10 and the sum path 20. The inputs are a first operand A0 A3, a second operand Bo B3, and the carry in signal C. on a line 30 from a prior adder in cell.The outputs are the sum digit signal Do D3 and carry out signal Court Gates 31 34 are 2 input AND logic gates, gates 41 48 are 2 input EXCLUSINE OR logic gates, gate 50 is a 4 input AND logic gate, and devices 61 67 are 2 to 1 multiplexers MUX The details of a particularly efficient 2 to 1MUX 100 for use in such an adder are shown in Figures 2A and 2B. The input signals are INO IN1, and CONTROL on lines 130, 140 and 150, respectively, and the MUX 100 output signal on line 160 is OUT. When CONTROL is a logicalO the P channel MOSFET 110 is on and the N channel MOSFET 120 off and INO is connected to the OUT line. When the CONTROL signal on the line 150 is a logical 1 the Nchannel IN1 is connected to the OUT line.Thus, the Boolean expression for the MUX 100 is OUT CONTROL IN1 t CCONTROL IN0 3 which is of the same form as the C. expression shown in theBoolean equations accompanying Table 1. It should be noted that it is well known in the art that the logical equivalent of a 2 to 1 MUX 100 can be constructed from standard logic gates. Referring again to Figure 1, since this is the first adder cell, C. O on line 30. If, for example, 1n the A operand is 0011, the binary equivalent of 3, and the B operand is 0101, the binary equivalent of 5, it can readily be seen that the resulting sum on the D lines DO D3 is 1000, the binary equivalent of 8 Since the sum is produced within the 4 digits D0 D3 available, Cout O In this traditional adder the MUXs 61, 62 and 63 provide the ripple path to create the carry signal Court, and the MUXs 64, 65 and 66 provide the independent ripple path to create the sum signal D0 D3. Figure 3 is the circuit diagram of a first embodiment of the present invention. A comparison of thisFigure with the prior art circuit of Figure 1 illustrates the structural differences, and similarities, between the two circuits. The circuit of Figure 3 has only a single ripple path across the MUXs 210, 211, 212, 213 instead of the two ripple paths of the circuit of Figure 1 and so produces a cost saving, simplification and greater efficiency in its structure, as compared with the prior art. Additionally, the MUX 210 of Figure 3, which is equivalent to the MUX 64 of Figure 1, has its output connected to the 1 input of the MUX 211, instead of the output of the AND gate 231 being connected thereto, the latter output being connected to the 0 input of the MUX 210.Each of the gates 246, 247, 248 then receives its carry signal as the output from the MUX 210, 211, 212 respectively.In this manner the number of MUXs is reduced from seven to five. The gates 231 234 and 241 244 have the same function as the gates 31 34 and 41 44 of the circuit of Figure 1.Similarly, the MUXs 212, 213, 214 and the gates 245 248 and 250 are equivalent to the MUXs 62,63,67, and the gates 45 48 and 50 of Figure 1. Figure 4 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. MUX s 210, 211, 212 and 213 provide a single ripple path for both the sum signals Do D3 and carry signal Court, as in the embodiment of Figure 3.. Thus, again., by using the invention a 4 bit adder is implemented with only five MUXs t210 214 as shown in Figure 4, rather than the seven MUXs t61 67 required in the prior art as shown in Figure 1. However, Figure 4 also shows the elimination of the AND gates 31 34 used in Figure 1. The logic function served by the AND gates 31 34 has been eliminated by the full utilization of the power of the 2 to 1 multiplexers which are required for producing the sum and carry functions. As shown in Figure 3 the B operand B0 B3 is used directly as the G0 G3 inputs to the MUXs 210 213 as a further logic reducing method. The result is an even more compact adder with fewer logic elements. It is clear to one skilled in the art that the disclosed invention can be implemented in technologies other than MOS.
