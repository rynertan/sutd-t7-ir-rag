# A catalytic hydrocarbon conversion process and a catalyst composition.

## Abstract
In a process for converting a high boiling hydrocarbon charge fraction to liquid products of lower boiling range which comprises contacting said charge fraction with a crys talline zeolite characterized by a silica alumina ratio greater than 12, a constraint index between about 1 and about 12 and an acid activity measured by the alpha scale less than 10, said contacting being conducted at 650 to 850 F., space vel ocity of 0.1 to 5.0 LHSV and a pressure not less than about 200 psi, the improvement which comprises utilizing, as catalyst, a zeolite of the above character that is prepared by steaming followed by base exchange to substantially elimi nate its activity for cracking n hexane.
