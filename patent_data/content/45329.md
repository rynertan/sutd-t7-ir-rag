# A cassette receiving arrangement for a video tape recorder.

## Abstract
A cassette base 7 for a video tape recorder is adapted to receive a cassette 1 having a pair of reels 8, 9 wound with a magnetic tape 10 and a closure lid 1. For easy manufacturing and simple assembly the base 7 is formed integrally with four levelling portions or tabs 5, 6 for locating a cassette 1 in a predetermined plane. Further tabs 4 serve to automatically open the lid 1 when the cassette 1 is pressed down onto the base 7 . The tabs 4, 5, 6 are all formed integrally with the main body of the base 7 by a cutting and folding operation.
