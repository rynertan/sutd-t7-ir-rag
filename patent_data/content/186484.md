## Description
Substituted 4,5 dihydro 6 substituted phenyl 3 2H pyridazinones and 6 substituted phenyl 3 2H pyridazinones useful as cardiotonic agents are the subject of U.S. Patent 4,353,905 and U.S. Application Serial No. 477,695 filed March 22, 1983. Additional references are cited therein to other known compounds. The present invention relates to novel 4,5 dihydro 4,4 dialkyl 6 substituted phenyl 3 2H pyridazinone compounds having unexpectedly superior activity as cardiotonic agents of the formula Preferred compounds of formula I of the present invention are the compounds of formula I wherein Q is oxygen, Y is hydrogen, and A is Most preferred compounds of the present invention are 4,5 dihydro 4,4 dimethyl 6 4 1 The present invention further relates to a cardiotonic composition for increasing cardiac contractility, said composition comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula I as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The present invention also relates to the method for increasing cardiac contractility in a patient requiring such treatment which comprises administering orally or parenterally in a solid or a liquid dosage form to such patient an effective amount of a compound of formula I as defined above. The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition which also decreases blood pressure, said composition comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula I as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Finally, the present invention relates to the method of decreasing blood pressure in a patient requiring such treatment which comprises administering to such patient an effective amount of a compound of formula I as defined above. The detailed description of a cardiotonic composition and the pharmaceutical composition, which may be used for the compound of formula I above in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, but now considering the unexpected activity of the present invention may be found in the above noted U.S. Patent 4,353,905 and U.S. Application Serial No. 477,695 filed March 22, 1983, which therefore, are hereby incorporated by reference. In the same manner the method of using the present compounds of formula I for increasing cardiac contractility and decreasing blood pressure can be ascertained from U.S. Application Serial No. 477,695 filed March 22, 1983, when appropriately noting the unexpectedly relative activity of the present formula I compounds. The relative activity is as set out hereinafter. The compounds of the present formula I are also useful in both the free base form and in the form of acid addition salts as described in U.S. Application Serial No. 477,695. The terms lower in reference to alkyl and alkoxy, as well as halogen are as defined in U.S. Application Serial No. 477,695. The relative activity showing unexpectedly superiority for the compounds of the present invention compared to those of the closest compounds of U.S. Application Serial No. 477,695 is shown in the following table. The test procedure for methods of use of the present invention, are as described in U.S. Application Serial No. 477,695. The following Example further illustrates the present invention without, however, limiting thereto. Imidazole 0.70 g, 0.013 mol and methyl α,α dimethyl 4 fluoro γ oxobenzene butanoate 2.85 g, 0.012 mol are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide 12.0 ml in which freshly pulverized potassium carbonate 5.80 g, 0.042 mol is suspended. The resulting mixture is stirred and heated at 100 110 for 12 hours. The mixture is then cooled to room temperature and poured into 100 ml of ice water and stirred for ten minutes. The solid is filtered to give 2.14 g of methyl α,α dimethyl 4 1 Methyl α,α dimethyl 4 1 The solution is evaporated to dryness and the residue is triturated with a small volume of ice cold ethanol and collected on a suction funnel to give 1.2 g of the title compound, mp 199 200 C.
