# CONTACT CHATTER DETECTOR

## Abstract
A contact chatter detector includes a bipolar power supp ly and a switching system which permits the fixed contacts of a relay under test to be connected either to the positive or the negative terminal of the power supply, the movable contacts of the relay under test being grounded. Depending upon the switch position and whether or not chatter is present, the fixed contacts may be at ground potential, a positive potential, or a negative potential. Binary gates continuously monitor the fixed contacts, and are able to accommodate the three input states by receiving power from power supply translation cir cuits. Interruption alarms connected to the gates determine whether chatter exceeds a predetermined minimum, which effectively adjust the gates to be responsive to the negative potential and ground at one switch position and to ground and the positive potential at another switch position.
