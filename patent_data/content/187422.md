## Description
PROCESS FOR THE TREATMENT OF BIOMASS WITH STEAM, PRODUCT THEREBY OBTAINED AND ITS USE AND REACTOR The present invention relates to a process for the treatment of biomass with steam. Comminuted biomass which compnses as main components cellulose, hemiceliulose and lignin and which may be denved from comminuted trees hard wood and soft wood , plants, grasses and waste matenals, such as wood chips, sawdust, chopped straw and bagasse, municipal waste and the like has long been recognised as a source of useful carbohydrates such as cellulose and sugars A great deat of research effort is currently being spent in this field of technology with the aim of producing sugars to be used as feed for fermentation processes optionally after additional . treatment and liquid fuels like ethanol from biomass. From Biotechnology Letters Vol. 4 No. 3 pp. 187 192 1982 by P. Morjanoff et at. a two stage autohydrolyis treatment of sugar cane bagasse hereinafter referred to as Morjanoff process is known. In the first stage most of the hemicellulose is removed from the bagasse leaving an extracted residue and in the second stage this residue is subjected to a high pressure steaming treatment in the presence of saturated steam. In this process sugar cane bagasse was used having a partide size less than 1 mum. In the above article the enhancing effect which the two stage autohydrolysis treatment appears to have on the enzymatic digestibility of sugar cane bagasse by hydrolysing the matenal with Trichoderma reesei cellulase enzymes is described. It has now been found that biomass and in particular hard wood can be very efficiently treated with saturated steam in a seated reactor without having to remove hemi cellulose first. Surprisingly it has further been found that the steam treated product is even better digestible by enzymes than a product which has been obtained from the same starting material but which has been subjected to the Morjanoff process .It appears to be important for getting a satisfactorily digestible product that the temperature at which the biomass is treated is above about 200 C. The enzymatic digestibility of the substrate derived from biomass which has been treated at temperatures bellow about 200 C appears to be insuffucient. However at temperatures higher than about 2509C decarboxylation rather than hydrolysis seems to occur. Therefore the optimal temperature is within the range of 200 250 C. Also the time of treatment Is an important parameter. A suitable time range for obtaining a satisfactory result appears to be 2 20mn. Thus the present invention provides a process for the treatment of biomass with steam in a sealed reactor at elevated temperature and pressure in a saturated steam environment comprising placing biomass In the reactor, sealing the reactor and heating the biomass until a temperature is reached in the range of 200 250 C, keeping the reactor at that temperature for 2 20 minutes before allowing it to cool gradually to room temperature while maintaining a saturated steam environment followed by opening the reactor and recovering the steam treated biomass. The biomass which is put in the reactor may be moist or dry. When necessary water should be added to ensure a saturated steam environment. Experimentally it has been found that for achieving the best results the reactor should be kept at a temperature of 210 2400C for 4 16 minutes. The biomass which is e.g. poplar wood, eucalyptus wood, bagasse, and or pinewood has preferably a water content of about 15 60 wt In order to enable the cooling of the steam treated biomass use is made of a cooling device. For reasons of practical convenience preferably a cooling plate, which is. in contact with the high temperature steam which is present around the biomass, is employed. Further efforts to improve the present process have resulted in the finding that if the biomass is soaked with certain metal satt solutions before it undergoes the steam treatment the enzymat.c digestibility of the steamed biomass is remarkably improved even though the duration of the steam treatment is considerably reduced. Therefore the use of metal salts which are able to increase the enzymatic digestibility of the steamed biomass forms a preferred embodiment of the process according to the present invention. Preferably the salt is selected from Lewis acid catalysts and in particular from the group consisting of ALCI,, Fe, SO. ,, FeCI, and H,SO.. For the purpose of this application H2SO. is considered to be within the scope of metal salts as claimed. The wood biomass can conveniently be subjected to the present process in the form of discs, chips, or flakes having suitably a thickness of 4 10mm and a diameter of 20 200mm Especially for countries with restricted facilities but with lots of wood available, the present process may provide an important means to produce carbohydrates containing biomass which forms another feature of the present invention. This biomass may be used as feedstock for cattle and other animals which are able to digest the steam treated wood or as feedstock for fermentatbn after optional additional enzymatic treatment. Therefore the present invention fatso provides an animal feed at yeast partly containing biomass which has been treated with the present steam treatment process. The present invention further provides a reactor for the present process, comprising a salable, elongated vessel having at the lower or upper end one or more inlets for steam and at the lower end an outlet for separating the steam treated biomass and at the upper end one or more outlets for steam and an inlet for fresh biomass and a fixed or interchangeable cooling element The present invention will be further illustrated with reference to the Examples. The application of a sealed reactor has been simulated by the use of seated glass tubes containing the biomass and enough water to ensure a saturated steam environment as further explained in Example I.Example I In a atypical experiment 0.129 milled poplar wood of 1 7 w moisture content together with 0.2ml water were sealed in a heavy walled glass tube. The tube was immersed in a hot oil bath to allow the wood to be steamtreated at a temperature of 220 C for 8 minutes. After cooling in air the tube was opened and the contents assayed using the cellulase enzyme assay technique to monitor glucose release. This standard cellulase enzyme assay is carried out as follows. The content of the glass tube is transferred to a 25ml conical flask. To this is added pHs buffer phosphatelcitrate and enzymes to obtain a 5ml liquid volume containing 1 mg ml Asoeroiilus niaer Sigma no. C 7377 and 1 Omgfml Trichodermavinde G B, MVA t284 enzymes solution. The assay flasks are incubated, with agitation, at 50 C. Aliquots are removed at regular time Intervals and the glucose content determined with an YSI model 23AM glucose analyzer. Results are shown in Figure I, which are further discussed in Example II. Example II comparative experiment Following the method of Morjanoff as described inBiotechnology Letters Vol. 4, 3 pp. 187 192, a 6 1w w mixture of water and poplar wood was heated in an auto ciave for 1 hour at 166 C and the treated wood was then washed with water and returned to the autoclave together with sufficient water to give an 8 1 wlw water wood mixture.The autoclave was then heated up to 204 C at an average rate of 4.6 C min , maintained at this temperature for 5 minutes and finally allowed to cool to room temperature an an average rate of 1SoClmin . Portions of water washed and unwashed steamed wood were then analysed by the cellulose assay and compared with a sample obtained from a glass tube experiment as in Example I. The results are given in Fig. 1 and show a higher rate of enzymatic digestibility for the material obtained from the glass tube expenment total conversion after 6 hours than for material obtained with the Morjanoff process .Example Ill comparative experiment The experiment following the method of Morjanoff was repeated but now at a heating rate of 17 OClminute which is comparable to the heating rate Morjanoff applied 120C minute and a cooling rate of 18.5 C minute Morjanoft250C minute . Water to wood ratio in the first stage was 4.5 1 and in the second stage 7.5 1. The temperature in the second stage was 2080C for 5 minutes. Figure 2 shows the enzymatic digestibility of two duplo samples thus obtained coded MORt FH andMOR2 FH compared to that of the sample obtained by the same method but with a lower heating and a lower cooling rate coded MOR1 LH , Example II . The digestibility of MORI FH and MOR2 FH appears to be slightly better than MOR1 LH, but bearing in mind that for both samples the amount of substrate is a factor 1.5 higher than for sample MOR1 LH the samples MOR1 FH andMOR2 FH can be judged to be identical to the substrate of sample MORl LH. Thus the differences in heating rate and cooling rate between the processes as described in Examples Il and Ill have no influence on the digestibility of the product obtained. It has thus been shown that the present steaming method produces better digestible cellulosic substrates than the Morjanoff method does.EXAMPLE IV 100 mg. dry wt. milled poplar wood of about 30 wt moisture was placed in a number of glasstubes. An aqueous solution of 0.25 wt AICIZ or tOmM H,SO, was added and left for 4 hours in order to leave the wood to soak.Then excess liquid was removed by centrifugation and pipethng, leaving approximately 0.4 ml of the aqueous solution in the tube. After sealing, the tubes were stored overnight and then placed in a hot oil bath for 4 minutes at 205 C. After cooling the contents were transferred to shake flasks and buffer and enzyme solutions were added as defined in Example I. The flasks were placed in a shaking waterbath 50 C and the glucose concentration was mon MOR1 FH Morjanoff process 1st sample Fast Heating itored at timed intervals. From Figures 3 it can be seen that a marked improvement in enzymatic digestibility was established for the catalysed samples in comparison with the enzymatic digestbility of the uncatalysed sample. EXAMPLE V As a comparative experiment 100mg dry wt milled poplar wood of 30 wt moisture content was placed in a number of glasstubes after which 0.2ml 0.25 W AICI, or 10mM H,SO, solution was added. This amount of liquid coats the wood parades rather than soaks them. The experiment was contained as in Example IV. FromFigures 4 it can be seen that although an improvement in enzymauc digestibility was established for the AICI, cata iysed sample, the improvement was only modest. Thus soaking of the wood as in Example IV is essential for obtaining a marked improvement in enzymatic digestibility as shown in Figure 3.
