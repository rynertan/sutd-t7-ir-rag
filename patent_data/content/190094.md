# Coal gasification composite power generator.

## Abstract
A coal gasification composite power generator which comprises a coal pulverizer in which coal is finely pulverized, a means for transferring the finely pulverized coal while drying the finely pulverized coal with a drying gas, a coal feeding means for feeding the coal from the transfer means to a gasification furnace in which the coal is converted to a combustible gas, a gas turbine connected to the gasification furnace and driven with the combustible gas fed from the gasification furnace, and an exhaust gas boiler to which an exhaust gas from the gas turbine is passed to recover the heat of the exhaust gas. The power generator is characte rized by further comprising a means for withdrawing part of the combustion exhaust gas at an upstream and a down stream sides of the exhaust gas boiler and mixing the withdrawn gases and a pipe connecting the withdrawing means and the pulverizer, so that the mixed gas is passed to the pulverizer.
