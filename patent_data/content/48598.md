# VIBRATION ISOLATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A vibration isolation system includes a seismic restraint assembly 28 that attenuates forces above a chosen magni tude transmitted to a unit 20, 22 from a support 26 during a seismic event. Vertical friction elements 96 on a vertical frame 34 engage and support a vertical damper element 90 . Horizontal friction elements 142, 144 on a horizontal frame 32 engage and retain a horizontal damper element 124 . One frame 128 is connected to the unit, the other 130 to the support. The vertical and horizontal damper elements interconnect, but lost motion spacing between these elements ordinarily prevents low level vibrations being communicated therethrough. Each of the vertical and hori zontal friction elements is spring biased by springs 104, 158 into a predetermined frictional engagement with its associ ated damper element. The force of the engagement is adjustable to adjust the level at which higher than ordinary forces that are being transmitted through the assembly will begin to be attenuated by slippage of the frictionally engaged elements.
