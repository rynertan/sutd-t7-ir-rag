## Description
A SOIL CULTIVATING MACHINE The invention relates to a soil cultivating machine comprising a number of soil working members, arranged adjacently in a row, and a packer roller situated therebehind, said roller being fitted at the rear with scraping elements mounted by means of upwardly directed arms on a supporting structure, which supporting structure comprises at least two supports situated above one another when seen in the machine s intended directed of travel, the lowermost support being provided with the arms for the scraping elements. Soil cultivating machines of this kind have a supporting structure for the scraping elements, which structure is situated relatively far to the rear, as a result of which the fitting of combination implements, in particular when using a packer roller of large diameter, offers no difficulties. According to the invention, a supporting structure is suggested wherein the upper support is situated substantially directly above a scraping element. Hereby, an arrangement of the supporting structure is obtained in such a way that it does not constitute a hindrance for combining the machine with other implements, such as a seed drill. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a soil cultivating .achine comprising a packer roller of a design according to the invention Figure 2 is, to an enlarged scale, a view in the direction indicated by arrow II in Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a view in the direction indicated by arrow III in Figure 2. The apparatus as shown in the drawings concerns a soil cultivating machine, in particular for preparing a seed bed, comprising a box like frame portion 1 extending transversely to the intended direction of travel A. In the box like frame portion 1, shafts 2 are arranged in bearings at equal interspacings of, preferably, 25 centimeters, which shafts extend in an upward, preferably vertical, direction.Each of the shafts 2 is equipped, directly underneath the frame portion 1, with a soil working member 3 comprising a support 4, which extends at least in a substantially horizontal direction, and soil working elements 5 of a tinelike formation mounted on the ends of the support thereby extending downwardly. The extremities of the frame portion 1 are provided with plates 6 extending upwardly and reaching above said frame portion 1. Near the leading and top side, each plate 6 is provided with a pivot 7, about which an arm 8 is pivotable, which arm extends rearwardly along the inner side of the plate. Near the rear side of a plate 6, each arm 8 has a part which is directed obliquely down and rearwardly and which merges in a segment 9, which extends at least substantially parallel to the part of the arm 8 that extends along a plate 6 Figure 2 . Each of the arms 8 is adjustable in height by means of a screw spindle 3A situated near the rear side of the frame portion 1. A support 11, extending obliquely in a downward and rearward direction, is mounted on the part 9 of each arm 8 by means of bolts 10. By means of holes 12, the support 11 can be adjusted in a more forward position. A packer roller 14 is fitted, freely rotatably, between the ends of the supports 11 by means of bearings lodged in bearing housings 13. The packer roller 14 comprises a cylindrical support 15. Welded to the circumference of the cylindrical support 15 are adjoining pairs of tine like projections 16, the arrangement being such that groups of tine like projections are formed, the said groups being situated at, at least substantially, equal interspaces Figures 1 and 3 . The broadest side of the tine like projections 16 extends at least substantially parallel to a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation a of the packer roller 14. The size of the cylindrical support 15 and the height of the tine like projections 16 are such, that the diameter of the roller is approximately 50 centimeters. Scraping elements 17 are mounted between the consecutive groups of tine like projections 16. Each scraping element is constituted by a rectangular plate, preferably manufactured from spring steel.A scraping element 17 is mounted, by means of a base 18, on the lowermost side of a support 19 constituted by a flat strip and extending obliquely in a rearward and upward direction. Said strip is arranged in such a way that its broadest side extends substantially parallel to the intended direction of travel A. The width of each strip shaped support 19 increases from the lowermost side in an upward direction. Each strip shaped support 19 has, near the upper side, a circular aperture, the arrangement being such that the respective strip shaped supports are slidable about a tubular support 20 with a round cross section, after which the supports can be welded, once the correct position of the scraping elements has been adjusted Figures 2 and 3 . The tubular support 20 extends at least substantially parallel to the axis of rotation a of the roller 14.Between the extremities, the tubular support 20 is provided with supports 21 directed upwardly and fitted to a tubular transverse support 22, which support, in the embodiment shown, has an angular, preferably square, cross section and extends parallel to the tubular support 20. The transverse support 22 is mounted between the extremities of the segments 9 of the arms 8 in such a way that the upright sides incline slightly forwardly from the lowermost side Figure 2 . The diamater of the transverse support 22 is arger than that of the tubular support 20. A reinforcement strip 23 is mounted between the extremities of each of the segments 9 and the lowermost end of a support 11. The tubular support 20 constitutes, together with the transverse support 22 situated above same, a supporting structure 24 for the roller, said structure being within the roller s circumference and in the upper, hindmost quadrant, seen in the intended direction of travel and with the parts 9 of the arms 8 being in a horizontal or a virtually horizontal position. Both the tubular support 20 and the transverse support 22 are then in the near vicinity of the trajectory described by the extremities of the tine like projections 16.The longitudinal centre line of the tubular support 20 lies at a circumferential angle of j 100 above a horizontal plane through the axis of rotation a of the roller 14, while the longitudinal centre line of the transverse support 22 lies at a circumferential angle of 400 above the said plane. Through the application of the combination of transverse support 22 and tubular support 20 not only an efficient support for the scraping elements 17 is obtained, but at the same time a convenient fixation of the said elements. The arrangement of both supports is of such a nature that a compact construction is possible, without constituting an impediment for mounting other implements to the machine, such as e.g. a seed drill. As is apparent from Figure 2, the upper support 22 is situated substantially directly above a scraping element 17. Each of the scraping elements 17 is situated at a point against the cylindrical support 15 at a circumferential angle of j 650 with the horizontal plane through the axis of rotation a of the roller 14. The scraping element 17 is then in a virtually horizontal position Figure 2 .Each rectangular scraping element 17 comprises two apertures, the lowermost of which is provided for fitting a bolt 25 in order to mount the scraping element to the base 18, while the upper recess allows a co operation with a pin 26 on the base, the entire assembly being so arranged that, after unfasten in 9 the bolt 25, the rectanaslar plate can be reversed, whereby the opening for the bolts 25 allows a co operation with the pin 26, while in the opening for the pin 26 the fastening bolt 25 can be inserted. The extremities of the frame portion 1 are equipped with a pivotable plate 26A, which is rotatable by means of an arm about an axle extending in the intended direction of travel said plate permits a co operation with an outer soil working member during machine operation. Within the box like frame portion 1, each shaft 2 is provided with a pinion 27, the arrangement being such that the pinions on the shafts 2 of adjacent soil working members 3 are in mesh with each other. Near the middle of the frame portion 1, the shaft of a soil working member 3 is extended and projects into a gearbox 28, which is mounted on the frame portion s upper side.Within the gearbox 28, the extension of said shaft is engaged, through a conical gear transmission, in a driving relation with a shaft extending in the intended direction of travel A and projecting at the rear side into the housing of a variable speed gear 29 and being engaged, within this housing, through the intermediary of change gears, in a driving relation with a shaft 30, situated above said shaft, also extending in the intended direction of travel anc protruding from the gearbox at the front side. The shaft 30 can be coupled to the power takeoff shaft of a tractor by means of an intermediate shaft 31.Near the front side, the frame portion 1 is provided with a trestle 32 for coupling the machine to the three point lift hitch of a tractor. The performance of the machine as described before is as follows. During operation, the machine is coupled by means of the trestle 32 to the three point lift hitch of a tractor and each of the soil working members 3 can be made to rotate from the tractor Dower take off shaft through the transmission described, the arrangement being such that adjacent soil working members rotate in opposite directions, during which their soil working elements 5 work at least adjoining strips of soil. By means of the packer roller 14 the working depth of the soil working elements can be set by adjusting the arms 8 with the aid of the screw spindles 8A fitted to the rear side of the frame portion. During machine travel, the packer roller 14 is made to rotate by means of the tine like projections 16 constituting cams, whereby the circumference of the cylindrical support 15 exerts a compacting effect on the soil cultivated previously.In this way, a pre eminently suitable seed bed, slightly compacted, can be created, said bed offering optimum conditions for seed germination. With the aid of the scraping elements 17, soil can be kept from clogging during operation between the tine like projections 16, such clogging causing the roller s performance to go to waste. The lowermost side of the scraping elements 17 bears against the cylindrical support 15 at a point, situated so low, that adherent soil is scraped off immediately, so that it cannot in any way pose an impediment to the germination of the seed.Because the lowermost tubular support 20 and the transverse support 22, situated above said support, together constituting the supporting structure 24, are disposed above one another and in the immediate vicinity of the circumference of the packer roller, while the supporting structure, seen in rear view, is situated virtually within the roller s circumference, this supporting structure does not constitute an impediment for a compact structure and for linking an implement to be combined with the machine. Moreover, a simple adjustment and fixation of the scraping elements can be obtained, since the strip shaped supports 19 can be strung onto the tubular support and welded after adjustment of the scrapers. On account of the fact that the broadest side of the stripshaped supports is situated in the intended direction of travel and that, moreover, the width of these supports tapers downwardly, a clogging caused by material carried along, e.g. weeds, is counteracted,
