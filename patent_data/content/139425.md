# A constant current source circuit.

## Abstract
A circuit producing a relatively stable constant current during power source voltage fluctuations which includes a resistor means and first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth transistor devices. The first and second transistor devices are first like conductivity and are connected to each other so as to form a first current mirror circuit, the first transistor device being connected in a diode fashion. The third and fourth transistor devices are second like conductivity and are connected to each other so as to form a second current mirror circuit, the third transistor device being connected in series with the second transistor device, and the fourth transistor device being connected in a diode fashion. The fifth transistor device is connected at its collector emitter path in series with the first transistor device and at its base electrode to the connection point between the second and third transistor devices. The resistor means is connected between the first and fifth transistor devices. And the sixth transistor device is connected at its collector emitter path in series with the fourth transistor device and at its base electrode to the connection point between the fifth transistor device and the resistor means.
