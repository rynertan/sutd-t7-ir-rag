# Sealing means for filter press cells.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an electrolytic cell which is comprised of a first frame member housing an electrode and a second frame member housing an electrode. A separator is positioned between the first frame member and the second frame member. A first sealing means contacts a side of the first frame member and one side of the separator. Contacting the second frame member is a second sealing means having a raised portion which also contacts a side of the separator. Pressing means are provided which press the frames together against the sealing means and the separator to form a substantially fluid tight seal. The novel electrolytic cells provide the advantages of simultaneously a. controlling gasket compression pressures, b. controlling gasket frame surface structural forces, c. efficiently forming a seal, and d. preventing gasket slippage.
