## Description
Stabilized injection compositions and their preparations The invention relates to pH and colour stabilized, aqueous paranteral pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antibacterial aminoglycoside comprising a pyranose ring being unsaturated between the positions 4 and 5 and substituted with an aminoalkyl group at position 5 , preferably sisomicine, netylmicine or 5 epi sisomicine, and the parenterally acceptable salts thereof, and to a process for the preparation of these compositions. It is known from the art that certain problems arise in connection with the stabilization of the colour and the pH of solutions of antibiotics belonging to the above group. In order to overcome the problems it was suggested Hungarian patent application No. SchE 699 to adjust the starting pH of the composition to 5,0 6,5, and preferably, but not necessarily, to add an antioxidant. According to this specification a stable composition can preferably be prepared at a pH of 6,2 to 6,5. Upon examining the electrochemical oxidation of sisomicine sulphate at different pH values it was found that the peak potential of the electrochemical oxidation decreases to a certain limit with increasing pH. The figs. 1, 2 and 3 show the voltametric curves obtained by electrochemical oxidation of formulations having the same composition as described in example 1, comprising sisomicine sulphate as active ingredient. The curves show that a lower peak potential belongs to higher pH values. It has surprisingly been found that though the peak potentials decrease with increasing pH values the sisomicine compositions adjusted to a higher pH value pH 7,3 are more stable than the compositions having a lower pH value. This also applies for the compositions comprising the abovelisted antibiotics. Accordingly, stable pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared according to the invention from the above listed antibiotics in a substantially higher pH range than it was earlier described. The pH of normal blood or plasma, i.e. of the physiological blood and tissues, is within the range of 7,3 to 7,4 and the same pH is applied according to the invention. Thus the antibiotics can be administered to the organism at an optimum pH, i.e.at the pH of the physiological blood. Therefore the treated organism is unaffected by adverse effects which is optimal from the point of view of medical treatment According to the invention stable pharmaceutical formulations comprising as active ingredient either sisomicine Hungarian patent specification No. 079 145 , netylmicine Hungarian patent specificationNo. 170 513 or similar or related derivatives thereof can be prepared. The pH and colour stabilized, aqueous parenteral pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention comprise an antibacterial aminoglycoside comprising a pyranose ring being unsaturated between positions 4 and 5 and substituted with an aminoalkyl group at position 5 , are obtainable by dissolving the active ingredient or a salt thereof in water, adjusting the pH of the solution to 7,3 7,4, adding an antioxidant to the solution, bubbling nitrogen through the solution after sterile filtration and filling the solution thus obtained into ampoules under nitrogen. They comprise preparably sisomicine, netylmicine or 5 epi sisomicine or the parenterally acceptable salts thereof as antibacterial aminoglycosides and are particularly suited for injections. The process according to the invention for preparing the above defined pH and colour stabilized, aqueous parenteral pharmaceutical compositions is characterized by dissolving an antibacterial aminoglycoside comprising a pyranose ring being unsatured between positions 4 and 5 and substituted with an aminoalkyl group at position 5 or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof in water, adjusting the pH of the solution to 7,3 7,4, adding an antioxidant to the solution, bubbling nitrogen through the solution after sterile filtration and filling the solution thus obtained into ampoules under nitrogen. Preferably, sisomicine, netylmicine or 5 episisomicine or the parenterally acceptable salts thereof are used as antibacterial aminoglycosides. Phosphite or sulphite salts can preferably be used as antioxidants, but any other system may also be used which is neutral or not harmful to the organism. The pH can be adjusted by addition of sodium hydroxide and or buffer systems. 2 Amino 2 hydroxymethyl 1,3 propanediol buffer and or sodium hydroxide potassium hydrogenphosate buffer can preferably be used. The invention is illustrated in the following with reference to examples.Example 1 A comparative experiment was carried out, wherein a sisomicine sulphate solution obtained without adjusting the pH solution 1a a solution described in Hungarian patent application No. SchE 699 at pH 6,2 which pH is declared to be the best by the aforementioned application solution 1b and the solution prepared according to the invention solution 1c were compared from the point of view of stability. The formulations of the compositions and their preparation were as follows Solution la mg Sisomicine in the form of sisomicine sulphate 50,0Sodium metabisulphite 3,0Methyl parabene 0,8Propyl parabene 0,1Disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate 0,1Sodium chloride 3,6Distilled water ad 1,0 ml.Solution ib mg Sisomicine in the form of sisomicine sulphate 50,0Sodium sulphite 0,8Sodium metabisulphite 2,4Propyl parabene 0,1Methyl parabene 0,8Disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate 0,1 Sodium chloride 3,9 mgDistilled water ad 1,0 ml. The pH of the solution was about 5,2. 0,1 N sodium hydroxide was added to the solution to adjust the pH to 6,2.Solution 1c mg Sisomicine in the form of sisomicine sulphate 50,0Sodium sulphite 0,8Sodium metabisulphite 2,4Propyl parabene 0,1Methyl parabene 0,8Disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate 0,1Sodium chloride 3,9Distilled water ad 1,0 ml. The pH of the solution was about 5,2. 1 N sodium hydroxide was added to the solution to adjust the pH to 7,35. The above solutions were prepared and filled under nitrogen atmosphere. They were examined as follows The samples were treated at 40, 50 and 60 C in a thermostatized hot air chamber for 30 days thereafter the pH, the colour and the active ingredient content were checked. The colour was compared with the colour measure according to Ph. Hg. VI., the active ingredient content was determined microbiologically by measuring the biological activity. The results are summarized in the following table.

The active ingredient content of solution 1b was satisfactory after the heat treatment, but its colour was strongly darkened even after the heat treatment at 40 OC, and its pH significantly decreased.In the case of solution 1c according to the invention both the colour and the active ingredient content were suitable even after the heat treatment at 60 C, and the pH remained unchanged.Example 2 A composition of the following formulation was prepared mg Sisomicine base in the form of sulphate 10,0Propyl p oxybenzoate Ph.
