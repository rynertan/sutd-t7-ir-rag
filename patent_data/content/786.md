# Closed type boiling cooling apparatus.

## Abstract
A closed type boiling cooling apparatus for cooling a heat generating member 10 by utilizing the latent heat of vaporization of a boiling refrigerant 8a comprises a cooling vessel including an evaporator section 1 and a condenser section 3 . A liquid refrigerant reservoir 6 is enclosed at its upper opening portion with an expansible member 7 and is connected with the cooling vessel by means of a condenser pipe 5 . The cooling vessel and the condenser pipe 5 are filled with the boiling refrigerant 8a when no cooling operation is performed. When cooling operation is initiated the boiling refrigerant 8a is changed into gaseous state 8c and then led into the condenser pipe 5 which serves to liquefy the gasified refrigerant 8a and feed it into the liquid refrigerant reservoir 6 . The expansible member 7 is adapted to expand in response to the change in the amount of the liquid refrigerant 8b led into the reservoir 6 so that the internal pressure of the cooling vessel can be maintained substantially constant.
