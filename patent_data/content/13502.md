# A disc brake lining wear indicator.

## Abstract
In a disc brake of the type including a transversely dis posed bridge bar 56 carried on the outboard end of a push rod 50 and bearing against the inboard face of the back plate 34 of the inboard brake pad 30 , a pair of pins 64b is secured at their outboard ends to the respective radially outer ends of the bridge bar. The pins are extending axially inboard through aligned bores 22a in the inboard web of the brake caper 22,24,26 to provide, as a function of the length of pins exposed inboard of the inboard caliper web, a measure of the remaining thickness of the brake pads 30,32 . These pins 64b acting as lining wear indicators, substitute as well for the usual means for precluding rotation of the push rod and for providing bearing support for the push rod at its outboard end. Whilst a self adjusting brake having an adjuster nut 51 and ratchet mechanism 44 ,to take up brake pad wear is illustrated, the invention is equally applicable to non self adjusting brakes, in which case the pins 64b provide an indication of brake pad wear when the brake is actuated.

## Description
A DISC BRAKE ASSEMBLAGE This invention relates to a disc brake assemblage comprising a housing structure including a caliper housing section carrying inboard and outboard brake pads adapted to coact with the opposite faces of a brake disc secured to a wheel of an associated vehicle and including inboard and outboard web portions to be disposed generally normal to the wheel axis of the associated vehicle on opposite sides of the brake disc, and a generally tubular housing section extending axially inwardly from the inboard face of said inboard web portion, a push rod mounted within said tubular housing section for reciprocal braze apply and release movement along a line of action generally parallel to said axis and having a free, outboard end projecting through an aperture in said inboard web portion to press the inboard brake pad against the inboard face of a brake disc in response to brake apply movement of an actuator ember, in use of the assemblage. A problem which arises with disc brakes particularly in heavy duty truck applications is to check them for lining wear. Lining wear can be readily checked in a drum type brake by either, as in passenger car applications, removing the wheel or, as in heavy duty truck applications, viewing the shoe thickness through a view port provided in the wheel expressly for that purpose.Lining wear in a disc brake passenger car application can be readily checked by removing the wheel. However, checking the lining wear in a disc brake heavy duty truck application is extremely difficult. Specifically, it is not feasible to use a viewing port as in the case of drum brakes since the disc brake pads, by virtue of their orientation, reveal their thickness only when viewed in a fore and aft direction, and viewing in this direction is blocked by the tire.And removing the wheel or wheels of a heavy duty truck is a time consuming and expensive task, requiring removal of the associated drive axle shaft, replacement of lost axle lubricant, and lifting of a tire wheel mass weighing upwards of 400 pounds. whereas various systems have been proposed for checking lining wear on a heavy duty truck disc brake application without removing the wheel assembly, the proposed systems have been complicated, expensive, or ineffective and, accordingly, none have met with any substantial degree of commercial success. The invention provides a disc brake assemblage as described in the opening paragraph hereof having means defining a generally axially extending through bore in said inboard web portion radially outwardly of said tubular housing section and an indicator pla having its outboard end positively positionally related to the inboard face of said inboard pad and extending axially from that end through said bore to project its inboard end axially inwardly from the inboard face of said inboard web portion radially outwardly of said tubular housing section and thereby provide, as a function of the length of pin exposed, a measure of the remaining thickness of the brake pads in use of the assemblage. The push rod may have a coacting threaded 50er threadably engaging the push rod at a location thereon inboard of said outboard end, a bridge bar being prosfid on the free outboard end of said push rod adapted to press the inboard brake pad against the inboard face of a brake disc in response to brake apply movement of said push rod in use of the assemblage, and said indicator pin being secllued at its outboard end to said bridge bar so as to provide a means of precluding rotation of said push rod to enable axial movement of said push rod in response to rotation of said coacting threaded member. This eliminates the need for the conventional anti rotation means between the backing plate of the brake pad and the bridge bar, thereby cheapening the construction. Conveniently, a pair of indicator pins are secured to the bridge bar, one adJacent each end of the bar, and the pins extend through bores in the inboard web of the caliper on opposite sides of the tubular housing section. This arrangement allows the indicator pins to also function as a bearing support for the outboard end of the pus rod, thereby eliminating the need for the conventional outboard bearing means thereby further cheapening the struction. One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to drawi ngs which illustrate only one specific embodiment and in which Figure 1 is a side elevational view, looking from inboard to outboard, of an air disc brake including a disc brake assemblage of the present invention Figure 2 is a cross sectional view taken on line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a view, partially in section looking in the direction of the arrow 3 in Figure 1 and Figure 4 is a view on an enlarged scale of the structure within the circle 4 of Figure 3. The Figures show an air disc brake including a torque plate 10, a caliper 12, a brake disc 14, and an actuator assembly 15. Torque plate 10 includes a central opening 16 adapted to pass the axle housing of an associated vehicle a a plurality of bolt holes 18 for use in fastening the torque plate to a suitable flange on the vehicle axle housing. Caliper 12 is mounted on torque plate 10 for limited slidingtranslatorymovement on the torque plate in a direction generally parallel to the axis of the axle assembly. Various arrangements may be employed to provide the required sliding mounting of the caliper on the torque plate. The disclosed arrangement includes a pair of upper and lower guide pins 20. Further details of the disclosed arrangement are shown in U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 974186 assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Caller 12, at the location of the section of FIGURE 2, is generally C shaped and includes inboard and outboard web portions 22, 24 disposed generally normal to the wheel axis of the associated vehicle on opposite sides of disc 14, and a spacer portion 26 interconnecting the web portions.As best seen in FIGURE 3, caliper 12 is of the open back type, i.e., spacer portion 26 is not continuous but rather is broken to provide a window or opening 28 so that brake pads 30, 32 together with backing plates 34, 36 may be removed for replacement, without removing caliper 12, simply by removing a pair of bolts 38. Bolts 38 pass through outboard caliper web portion 24 and through suotabN holes in backing plates 34, 36 for threaded engagement with threaded through bores 40 FIGURE 1 in inboard caliper web portion 22. As is typical of open back caliper designs, the caliper being described has a considerable arcuate extent ac compared to closed back designs. As shown, caliper 12 has an arcuate extent, as scribed from the center of opening 16, of approximately 130 degrees FIGURE 1 . Disc 14, as best seen in FIGURE 3, includes a peripheral rim portion 14a received between inboard and outboard brake pads 30, 32 and a flange portion 14b. Flange portion 14b includes a plurality of bolt holes for securing disc 14 to a wheel not shown of an associated vehicle as by bolts 42. Actuator assembly 15 is carried by inboard caliper web portion 22. Actuator assembly 15 includes a generally L shaped housing assembly 44 projecting axially inwardly from inboard web portion 22, an air motor 4. secured to the free end of housing assembly 44 by bolts 47, a wedge actuator member 48 driven by the air motor, and a tappet or push rod assembly 49. Push rod assembly 49 includes a push rod 50 and an adjuster nut 51 threaded onto the inboard end of rod 50. Nut 51, and thereby push rod 50, is driven axially by a wedge portion 48a of actuator member 48 through a roller bearing assembly 52.A coil return spring 51a, positioned between the outboard face of nut 51 and the inboard face of a retainer ring slob, functions to return the push rod assembly to its rest position following retraction of wedge actuator 48. An inboard bushing 53 journals the inboard end of push rod assembly 49 in housing 44, and a collar 54 is press fit on nut Sl. Collar 54 is provided with an external helical ratchet thread and coacts with corresponding ratchet teeth on a spring loaded ratchet pawl 55 to provide, in known manner, automatic self adjustment of the push rod assembly in response to Drake pad wear.See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,068,964. The free or outboard end of push rod 50 is received with a press fit in a central hub portion 56a of a bridge bar 56 see also FIGURE 4 which in turn acts against backing plate 34 of inboard brake pad 30 to press pad 30 against the inboard face of disc rim portion 14a and thereafter slide the caliper inboard, to the right as viewed in FIGURE 3, to in turn apply outboard pad 32 against the outboard face of disc rim portion 14a whereby to brake the wheel of the associated vehicle. A dust boot 58, secured at its outboard end to a flange portion 56b of bridge 56 and at its inboard end to retainer ring 51b, precludes contamination of the interior of housing assembly 44. In the disclosed embodiment, housing assembly 44 is formed in two sections 60, 62. Inboard housing section 60 carries air motor 46, and houses wedge actuator 48. Outboard housing section 62 slideably receives push rod assembly 49 and is cast integrally with caliper 12 as a generally tubular housing section extending axially inwardly from the inboard face of the inboard web portion of the caliper. Housing section 60, and thereby air motor 46, are turned 900 out of their true position in FIGURE 3 for purposes of clarity the true orientÅation of housing section 60 and air motor 46 is seen in FIGURE 1. With particular reference now to FIGURES 3 and 4, a through axial bore 56c is provided in bridge bar 56 adjacent each end of the bar, and through axial bores 22a are provided in inboard caliper web portion 22 at opposite sides of tubular housing section 62 and in axial alignment with bores 56c. A steel indicator pin 64 is press fit at its outboard end 64a into each bore 56c and extends axially therefrom through the respective web portion bore 22a to project its inboard end 64b axially inwardly from the inboard face of web portion z24 Bores 22a are oversize with respect to pins 64. For example, if pins 64 are 7 16 inch in diameter, bores 22a should be approximately 17 32 inch in diameter to allow for a limited amount of slop in the overall system and preclude binding of the pins in the bores.The length of pins 64 is chosen such that the length of pin exposed inboard of web portion 22, with fresh pads 30 and 32 in place, is somewhat less than the combined thickness of fresh pads 30 and 32. The described arrangement will be seen to provide a positive positional relationship between the outboard ends of pins 64 and the inboard face of the inboard pad. As wear occurs in pads 30, 32, bridge bar 56 by virtue of the self adjusting action of pawl 55, collar 54, adjuster nut 51, and push rod 50 will follow pad 30 and, specifically, will move outboard, or to tune left as viewed in FIGURE 3. At the same time, caliper 12 will move inboard along pins 20 in respons to wear occurring in outboard pad 32.Both of these wear induced movements, i.e., the outboard movement of bridge bar 56 and the inboard movement of caliper 12, will have the effect of gradually swallowing pins 64 within caliper 12 and thereby gradually reducing the length of pin exposed. The length of pin exposed, and thereby the thickness of padding remaining, can be readily determined at any given time, either visually or tactilely. When the pads have worn down to what has been predetermined to be a minimum safe operating thickness, the pins will have been completely swallowed by the caliper so that the inboard tip 64c of the pin will be flusH with the inboard face of inboard caliper web 22 when this flush configuration is observed or felt, it is time to change the pads.It will be apparent that the desired predetermined minimum pad thickness will dictate the amount by which the combined thickness of the fresh pads exceeds the length of originally exposed pin. For example, if the fresh pads are each one inch thick and it is desired to change pads when they wear down to a thickness of one eighth inch, the length of pin originally exposed will be 1 3 4 inches. In addition to providing an accurate and ready means of determining remaining pad thickness, pins 64 also provide a means of precluding rotation of push rod 50. Since the self adjusting mechanism requires that rod 50 be held against rotation, and thereby be axially advanced, as adjuster nut 51 is rotated by ratchet pawl 5, pins 64, by precluding such rotation, enable the operation of the self adjusting mechanism.Previous arrangements for precluding such rotation, such as interlocking connections between the bridge bar and the inboard backing plate, are thereby obviated. Pins 64, by virtue of their even spacing on either side of the central axis of push rod 50, also provide an effective outboard bearing for push rod assembly 49, thereby eliminating the need for the conventional outboard push rod assembly bushing. Although actuator housing section 62 has been disclosed as a casting formed integrally with the caliper, it will be apparent that this housing section may be formed as a separate part and secured to the caliper as by bolt ing, in which event the bolt flange of the separate housing would, in effect, constitute a portion of the inboard web of the caliper and the indicator pins, even if arranged to pass through bores in the bolt flange of the separate housing, would still, in eff be passing through bores in the inboard web of the ca1ipr Further, whereas a lining wear indicator has been described in connection with a brake mechanism having a self adjusting provision so that the bridge bar effectively follcws the brake pads as the latter undergo wear, the invention is also applicable to a brake that does not include a self adjusting mechanism provided, however, that the wear indicator, in the case of a non self adjusting brake, will provide an accurate indication of lining wear only when the brake is actually applied.
