# Seedling growing package partition therefor and method of propagating seedlings therewith.

## Abstract
A seedling growing container is illustrated wherein a number of removable partitions or barriers B,C are posi tioned together in a block. Each of the partitions has interconnected diverging walls forming a series of troughs therebetween open at the top and the bottom so that the partitions B,C may be placed in opposing relation as in a tray A forming growing compartments from each of the opposing troughs which are in register with each other, suitable for growing a single seedling. Positioning of the plugs is contemplated such that alternate rows of plugs of growing material, each of which is capable of growing a single seeding, are utilized so that each plug will be surrounded for the most part by a partition B,C with the remainder being surrounded by an air space for preventing roots from growing from one plug to the other through the process of air pruning. The tray A is partially open at the bottom 12 , at least to an extent sufficient to provide an opening for heated air to be passed upwardly through the voids formed by the omitted plugs for further encouraging growth of the seedlings. Any suitable means may be utilized for positioning the partition B,C together to form a block.
