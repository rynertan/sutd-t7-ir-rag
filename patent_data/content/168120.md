# Radiometer.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for measuring thermal irradiation. The apparatus, in the form of a thermal radiometer comprises a housing, a shutter mounted on a wall of the housing, a thermally conductive element positioned behind the shutter, the conductive element having a black surface facing the shutter, and means for measuring the temperature of the conductive element. The outer face of the shutter will be thermally reflective, and the radiometer will include means for calculating the rate of temperature rise of the conductive element after opening the shutter and an indicator responsive to the calculating means for displaying a value which is proportional to the rate of temperature rise. The method for measuring thermal irradiation comprises positioning a thermally conductive element having a black surface behind a shutter with the black surface facing the shutter, allowing the element to assume ambient temperature, opening the shutter and measuring the subsequent rate of temperature rise of the element, and using the rate of temperature rise to determine the level of irradiation.
