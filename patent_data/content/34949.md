## Description
SCALPEL BLADE REMOVER AND COLLECTOR Field of the Invention This invention relates to scalpels or surgical knives of the type comprising a handle having a reduced section at one end thereof with an elongated boss on one side of said reduced section, said boss having a recess partially extending along each side thereof, and a blade having an elongated slot therein with a reduced section, said slot being complemental to said recessed boss, such that the blade is retained on said boss when the reduced section of the blade slot engages the recess on the boss. Background of the Invention The traditional scalpel surgical knife has been extensively used in surgery for a number of years and would be the most widely used surgical instrument in the world at present. The scalpel, due to its extensive use in all parts of the world, consists of a standardised range of handles and blades. It is generally accepted that the handle section of the scalpel, due to its expense, is cleaned, sterilized and re used after each surgical procedure, while the blade section is used once only thereby ensuring the sharpness of the blade each time it is used. At present it is difficult to replace the blade due to the blade being firmly locked onto the handle, the danger involved in attempting to manipulate a fairly sharp, small and contalninated blade using fingers which may be accidentally cut and infected. There is a further problem in storing and transporting used scalpel blades to a point of disposal. The generally used present procedure is to remove the blade from the handle using forceps or similar device and placing the used blades in a container for transport to a disposal station. It is subsequently necessary to clean and sterilize the contaminated forceps and transport container. A device has been proposed in applicants earlierAustralian Patent Application No. 25594 77 for removing and storing the blade of a scalpel of the type described hereinabove comprising a container adapted to accommodate at least one blade, an aperture in said container shaped to allow the introduction of the blade retaining reduced section of the scalpel into said container such that the blade is in opposed relation to the top of the container and the separation of the inner end of said blade from said section, abutment means projecting outwardly from said aperture adapted to abut against the inner end of the blade when the handle is depressed and removed from said container restraining the blade from outward movement therefrom and allowing retention of the blade in the container. The above device has a number of disadvantages in that 1 the blade is removed partially outside the container thus potentially causing contamination of the environment including the user, there being also a possibility of the blade falling outside the container, 2 the blades may drop out of the container when the container is held in a specific position, say with the opening downwardly directed, and 3 the device necessitates proper specific positioning and relative alignment of the scalpel within the container and an intermediate depressing action on the scalpel handle by the user i.e. prior to withdrawal of the scalpel handle from the container . Summary of the Invention Accordingly, it is the principal objective of the present invention to provide a device for removing the blade from the scalpel handle with a simple reciprocal in out action, said device being simple and economical to manufacture, capable of easily and safely removing the blade and storing one or more of said blades without the possibility of any loss thereof, and being disposable at the same point as the blades. Accordingly, the present invention provides a device for removing and storing the blade of a scalpel of the type having a blade retaining reduced section at one end and a handle at the other end comprising 1 a container adapted to accommodate at least one blade, 2 an aperture in said container shaped to allow the introduction of the blade retaining reduced section of the scalpel into said container such that the blade is in opposed relation to the top of the container, 3 biassing means associated with the interior of the container to deflect the front end of the scalpel blade upon insertion of the blade retaining reduced section of the scalpel through the container aperture, and 4 a pivotal support within the container adjacent the container aperture for supporting the rear end of said blade, said support having a recess adapted to receive the reduced section and to permit the lifting of said rear end of the blade when the front end of the blade is deflected by said biassing means and the reduced section is depressed within said recess, the wall of the container adjacent the aperture being shaped to constitute an abutment for the rear end of the blade when the handle is axially withdrawn from said container restraining the blade from outward movement therefrom and allowing retention of the blade in the container. Preferred Embodiments of the Invention Conveniently, the biassing means may consist of a depressed section of the container wall, e.g. the top of the container. Conveniently, the recessed pivotal support may consist of a pair of opposed, inclined, rounded shoulders upwardly extending from the base of the container aperture. Advantageously, the abutment wall may include an inwardly turned lip adjacent the container aperture. Detailed description of the Invention The invention will now be described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 shows a typical scalpel handle and complemental blade before assembly Figure 2 shows the assembled scalpel with the blade located on the reduced section of the scalpel handle Figure 3 is a front view of the device according to the invention shown in Figure 6 hereinbelow Figure 4 is a view along Section X X of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a view along Section Z Z of Figure 4 and Figure 6 is an oblique view of the device according to the invention.Referring to Figures 1 and 2, a scalpel handle generally indicated as 1 consists of a main section 2 and a reduced section 3 having a raised elongated boss 4 thereon coextensive with the end 5 of the reduced section as shown.The boss 4 has a recess 6 partially extending along both sides of the boss from its extremity 5. A scalpel blade, generally indicated as 7, has a rectangular portion 8, a curved portion 9 and an elongated slot 10 having a section lOa and a reduced section lOb. The slot section lOa is adapted for complemental engagement with boss 4 and the reduced section lOb is adapted for location in the recesses 6, such that locked assembly of the scalpel blade 7 and handle occurs when the slot section lOa of the blade is superimposed on boss 4 and the blade is moved towards the handle section 2 Figure 2 , the interengagement of recess 6 and reduced slot lOb locking the blade 7 relative to the blade handle 1. Referring to Figures 3 to 5 of the drawings, a container generally indicated as 20 has top and bottom, and front and rear walls, generally indicated as 21 and 22, and 23 and 24 respectively, as well as side walls 25 and 26. Bottom wall 22 has a sloping section 22a, an upright section 22b and a substantially horizontal section 22c. Front wall 23 has a rectangular aperture 27 which includes a narrow section 27a adapted to receive the boss 4 of the reduced section 3 of the scalpel handle 1. A pair of rounded, inclined shoulders 28, 28a extend from the base of the aperture 27 rearwardly along horizontal section 22c to the end thereof to form a narrow recess 29 therebetween to accommodate the reduced section 3 of the scalpel handle 2. Recess 29 has a depth greater than the thickness of the reduced section 3. The tops of the shoulders 28 and 28a are indicated as 30, 30a and are at a height above the section 22c approximately identical with aperture 27. The top wall 21 of the container 20 has a depressed section 21a, 21b. This represents the most efficacious inclination of section 21a which is the section deflecting the scalpel blade 7 upon insertion thereof into the container 10. In practice, when the contaminated blade supporting reduced section 31 of the scalpel 1 is inserted into the aperture 27, 27a, shoulders 28, 28a guide the blade 7, specifically curved portion 9, until curved portion 9 reaches section 21a of the depressed section 21a, 21b. Reduced section 3 of the scalpel handle 2 is then located within recess 29 and rear end 8 of the blade 7 is supported on the tops 30, 30a of the shoulders 28, 28a. Upon further axial pressure, blade 7 is downwardly deflected by section 21a effecting depression of the reduced section 3 within recess 29 and at the same time lifting of the rear end 8 of the blade 7. When the scalpel handle 2 is withdrawn, the blade j abuts against the inner surface of front wall 23 and the blade 7 is then removed from the scalpel handle and drops onto bottom wall 22. The inner surface of front wall 23 may advantageously be provided with an inwardly turned lip 31 which facilitates the withdrawal of the blade 7 from the scalpel handle 2. With the construction of the device described above, it will be appreciated that to remove a contaminated blade from a scalpel handle, all that is required is a reciprocal rectilinear movement of the scalpel into and out of the container in contradistinction to the previously proposed device which necessitated an intermediate additional action, i.e. depression or pivotal depression of the scalpel handle prior to withdrawal thereof. It will furthermore be appreciated that as the abutment for the rear end of the blade is, according to this invention, located within the container i.e. rear surface of front wall , there is no possibility of contamination of environment or user during the removal of the blade. Furthermore, in view of the depressed section of the container and the disposition of the shoulders, there is virtually no possibility of loss of blades in any position of the device.
