# SHOT BLASTING MACHINERY

## Abstract
A shot blasting machine is dimensioned and adapted so that it can be hand held by a worker during a shot blasting operation. The machine includes an abrasive throwing wheel assembly which is housed within a hood both of which are preferably formed of a plastics material such as an elas tomeric polyurethane. The hood has a peripheral opening through which abrasive is directed by the throwing wheel assembly. A driving motor external and to one side of the hood is connected to the abrasive throwing wheel assembly to rotate the latter. The other side of the hood is formed with an abrasive inlet through which the abrasive is fed into the throwing wheel assembly. Handles are preferably provided on both the hood and the driving motor to assist the worker in supporting and guiding the machine during operation. Abrasive is preferably fed to the shot blasting machine from an overhead abrasive supply system from which the shot blasting machine is suspended by supporting cables or the like. The abrasive may be gravity fed to the shot blasting machine or it may be fed to the shot blasting machine through a screw conveyor arrangement.
