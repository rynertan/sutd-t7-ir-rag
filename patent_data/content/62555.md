# Pressure control system.

## Abstract
A pressure control system for use in vehicle emissions control includes an air control valve 12 having a housing 14 defining an inlet 16 communicated to the vehicle air pump and a pair of outlets 18, 20 . A primary valve assembly 22 controls communication between the inlet 16 and the outlets 18, 20 and includes a pair of valve members 54, 56 actuated by a differential pressure responsive diaphragm assembly 39 . The pressure differential across the dia phragm assembly 39 is controlled by a pressure signal generated from a pressure tap 84 from the inlet 16 . A pair of solenoid valves 88, 92 controls communication to the diaphragm assembly and to a pressure responsive relief valve assembly 60 which controls communication between the inlet 16 and an atmospheric vent 78 .
