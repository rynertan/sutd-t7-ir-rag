# Hitch control system.

## Abstract
A hydraulic rockshaft actuator 24 operates a rockshaft 12 to raise and lower a hitch in accordance with mixed posi tion control set by a lever 28 and draft control set by a lever 32 . The set points established by these levers are combined mechanically with actual rockshaft position sensed mechani cally by a ramp 14 on the rockshaft and actual draft load sensed hydraulically by a load sensor 34 and communicated to the mechanical combining arrangement 16 via a load con rol valve 17 . In order to provide this known system with en gine speed control to avoid labouring the engine and or wheel slip control to avoid excessive wheel slip , an electronic con trol unit 46 processes signals from corresponding transduc ers 54, 58, 60 and derives an electrical control signal. A pres sure control valve 40 in the hydraulic line between the draft load sensor 34 and the load control valve 17 enhances the hydraulic load signal so that reduced engine speed and or in creased wheel slip emulates increased draft load and therefore leads to the hitch being raised. To this end the control valve 40 has electrical pilot control 44 responsive to the electrical control signal in parallel with hydraulic pilot control 42 re ponsive to the pressure from the draft load sensor 34 . The draft control lever 32 sets the proportions of the mixed con trol and, within the control unit 46 the electrical control signal is gain scaled in dependence upon a signal A 6 from a trans ducer 52 on the lever 32 so that the effect of the electrical control signal is the greater the greater the proportion of draft load control in the mixed control.
