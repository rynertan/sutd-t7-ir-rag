# DOOR LOCK ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A door lock assembly 4 for fitting in a door 6 in the usual way having a deadbolt subassembly 12 with a deadbolt 42 shiftable between an extended locked position and a retracted unlocked position by an actuator arm 66 and biased toward the locked position by a spring 54 . The deadbolt is restrained in the retracted position by restraining plates 28, 34 which release the deadbolt via a trigger subassembly 16 . Such a deadbolt is thus automatically mechanically actuated with door closure for security so that closing the door actuates the trigger mechanism releasing the deadbolt restraining means and allowing the biased deadbolt to be thrown to the extended locked position.
