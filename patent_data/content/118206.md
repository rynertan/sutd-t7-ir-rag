# Piezoelectric scanning systems for ultrasonic transducers.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic scanning system is provided in which an ultrasonic transducer is oscillated for scanning purposes by a piezoelectric bender. One end of the bender is fixedly mounted in a sector scanner head, while the other end is connected to the ultrasonic transducer. The bender is deflected through the application of a drive voltage to electrodes plated on the piezoelectric material, causing the bender to deflect by a distance which is proportional to the applied voltage. The transducer is thereby caused to oscillate or rock by the motion of the bender.
