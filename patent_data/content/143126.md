## Description
PROCESS FOR COAGULATING SYNTHETIC RUBBER LATEX This invention relates to a process for effective coagulation of a synthetic rubber latex, comprising adding an aqueous solution of a polyalkylenepolyamine epihalohydrin copolymer to the synthetic rubber latex. In the production of synthetic rubber by emulsion polymerization, a latex of synthetic rubber is inevitably formed. In order to convert this latex into non agglomerative rubber crumbs, it is necessary to coagulate rubber particles present in the latex. It is well known that for achieving the coagulation of synthetic rubber particles there are used various coagulants including inorganic salts, e.g. sodium chloride, and organic high molecular compounds, e.g. polyethyleneimine, dimethylamine epichlorohydrin copolymer, dicyandiamide formaldehyde condensation product, and cation modified starch. However, when any of these coagulants is used, there arises a problem such that complete coagulation of the rubber particles in the latex is impossible or if possible, necessitates the addition of a greater amount of coagulant rubber crumbs produced fuse together, growing into massive aggregates and this makes it markedly difficult to wash off, in the after treatment step, such inclusions contained in the massive aggregates as a polymerization catalyst residue, emulsifier, and coagulation auxiliary, e.g. an inorganic salt or the pH and temperature Jf the rubber latex, and the amount of inorganic salt to be added must be strictly controlled so as to optimize the porosity of the crumb rubber for the purpose of facilitating the drying in the next operation step. Under the circumstances, the present inventors made intensive studies for solving various problems in the coagulation of synthetic rubber latex. As a result, it was found that by adding an aqueous solution of a polyalkylenepolyamine epihalohydrin copolymer as a coagulant to a pHrange adjusted latex of synthetic rubber, the coagulation of the latex particles becomes possible with an extremely small amount of coagulant as compared with the processes of adding conventional coagulants and this coagulant can be used in a wide range of pH values, gives a crumb rubber which exhibits an appropriate aggregation and porosity and hence a good washability and dryability also gives a colorless serum, and has no adverse effect on physical properties of the end product rubber. Based on this finding, this invention has bn accomplished. An object of this invention is to provide a process for effective coagulation of a synthetic rubber latex. Other objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following descriptions. According to this invention, there is provided a process for coagulating a synthetic rubber latex, which comprises adding an aqueous solution of a polyalkylenepolyamine epihalohydrin copolymer to the synthetic rubber latex adjusted to a pH of 1.3 to 7. The aqueous solution of a polyalkylenepolyamineepihalohydrin copolymer used as a coagulant in this invention is usually obtained in the form of an aqueous solution containing 20 to 80 by weight of solids by the reaction of a polyalkylenepolyamine and an epihalohydrin in a molar ratio of 1 0.3 2.5, preferably 1 0.5 1.5, at a reaction temperature of 20 to 800C for 30 minutes to 10 hours, where water is added to the reaction system at any desired time before, during, or after the reaction. Polyalkylenepolyamines suitably used herein include, for example, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, and imino bis propylamine . These compounds may be used alone or in combination. Examples of the epihalohydrin are epichlorohydrin and epibromohydrin, the former being preferable. The aqueous solution of such a polyalkylenepolyamine epihalohydrin copolymer used in this invention, is desired to have a viscosity of at least 30 cps at 250C when the solution contains 50 by weight of solids. When the viscosity is less than 30 cps, the expected effect often cannot be achieved. There is no particular restriction on the upper limit of the viscosity, but viscosities of the commonly used solutions are up to 2000 cps at 250C for 50 by weight of solid content. There is a tendency for the solutions of viscosities over 2000 cps to be inferior in the stability of viscosity on preserving that is, the viscosity exceeding 2000 cps often increases during storage of the solution, resulting in gelation and causing a trouble during survice.Accordingly, the solution having such a high viscosity needs to be stored at a low temperatures or used in an extremely short period of time after preparation thereof. The amount of the aqueous solution of the polyalkylenepolyamine epihalohydrin copolymer to be added is not particularly limited, provided that the amount is enough to coagulate a given synthetic rubber latex. While optimum amounts of the solution vary depending upon the nature and pH of the synthetic rubber latex, the liquid temperature during coagulation, the presence or absence of a salt, the quantity of the salt if present, etc., the solution is usually added in amounts of at least 0.005 part, desirably at least 0.01 part, preferably at least 0.02 part, by weight as solids per 100 parts by weight of solids in the synthetic rubber latex.The upper limit of the amount, though also not particularly limited, is usually 5 parts, desirably 1 part, by weight on the above basis , since the use of a too large amount of coagulant is uneconomical in as much as the effect thereof is not so large as that corresponding to the increased amount. The synthetic rubber latex to which the aqueous solution of the polyalkylenepolyamine epihalohydrin copolymer is to be added needs to have a pH of 1.3 to 7, preferably 1.5 to 6. Since the usual synthetic rubber latex is alkaline, the pH of the latex is generally adjusted in advance by addition of an acid to be brought into the above range. The acid used for this purpose may be either inorganic or organic, including, for example, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, and oxalic acid. When the pH of the synthetic rubber latex to be treated is over 7, the coagulating effect is poorer and a large amount of coagulant is required, resulting in worse economy. The pH less than 1.3 is also uneconomical, since in this case no enhancement of the coagulating effect is found and merely the acid consumption increases. Both the cases are undesirable. In this invention, salts hitherto known can be used together with the present coagulant solution for the purpose of carrying out the coagulation more effectively. Such salts are water soluole alkali metal salts of inorganic acids or organic acids, including alkali metal salts of, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, and maleic acid. The salts may be used along or in combination of two or more. Among them, sodium chloride may be usually employed. These salts are generally added each in amounts of 0 to 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of solids in the synthetic rubber latex. The amount exceeding 20 parts by weight is undesirable since the effect obtained is not so large as that corresponding to the amount. The synthetic rubber latex referred to in this invention includes styrene butadiene copolymer latex, acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer latex, polybutadiene latex, ethylene propylene copolymer latex, polyisoprene atex, and carboxylated latexes of these polymers. Particularly, when the rubber particle concentration in the latex is 10 by weight or more, a good coagulating effect is obtained. When the synthetic rubber latex is coagulated according to the method of this invention, there is no particular restriction upon the manner or order of the pH adjustment of the latex, addition of the aqueous solution of the polyalkylenepolyamine epihalohydrin copolymer, or addition of the salt. The temperature of the synthetic rubber latex during coagulation also can be selected from a range as wide as 0 to 1000C, preferably 200 to 900C, but it is advantageous in view of properties of the coagulum to carry out the coagulation at a temperature of 300C or higher. This invention is further illustrated below referring to the following Examples and Comparative Examples.However, the invention is not limited to these Examples. The The coagulants used in these Examples and Comparative Examples are as follows Resin A Diethylenetriamine 103 g, 1 mole and water 140 g were charged in a 3 necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, stirrer, and thermometer. While keeping the temperature at 600C with stirring the mixture, epichlorohydrin 92.5 g, 1 mole was added to the mixture dropwise from the dropping funnel. After 4 hours reaction at the same temperature, an aqueous solution of diethylenetriamineepichlorohydrin copolymer containing 58 wt of solids was obtained. When the solid content of the aqueous solution was adjusted to 50 wt , the viscosity of the solution was 75 cps at 250C.Resins B to J Using the various amines shown in Table 1 and epichlorohydrin, aqueous solutions of respective amineepichlorohydrine copolymers were prepared in the same manner as in the case of Resin A. Viscosities at 250C of the aqueous solutions adjusted to a solid content of 50 wt are given in Table 1.

After stirring for 2 minutes, the mixture was separated by using a 60 mesh wire gauze into a coagulated rubber floated on the liquid layer and a liquid layer referred to as serum water . The turbidity of the serum water was measured in accordance with JISK 0101 by using a turbidimeter supplied by Nippon FineOptics Co., Ltd. to evaluate the degree of coagulation of the latex. When this serum water is of very low urbidity, viz. very clear, this means that rubber latex particles in emulsified form did not remain in the serum water and hence the latex has been coagulated completely.The coagulated rubber was examined for porosity surface porosity or roughness and particle size, by visual observation, and the suitability of the coagulated rubber in an aftertreatment step in the synthetic rubber production process was evaluated with respect to the porosity and particle size. The evaluation criteria are as follows Good Excellent in the suitability. Bad Slightly inferior in the suitability. Very bad Inferior in the suitability. The results are summarized in Table 2.
