## Description
This invention relates to a method for detecting analyte moieties by means of a signalling moiety, and particularly by means of a signalling moiety that can aggrandize or be aggrandized and to an assay composition for detecting an analyte in a sample. Assay systems for the detection of analyte moieties of biomedical interest have been known for a number of years. These systems include, for example, immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, agglutination, and immunofluorescence. These systems variously have limitations in convenience, sensitivity, ease of sample preparation, adaptability to automation, and applicability to various specific analyte moieties. Radioimmunoassay RIA represents a convenient, sensitive, flexible, and easily automatable method for the detection. The disadvantages of RIA detection systems relates to the problems inherent in the use of radioisotopes, which provide the signal in RIA s. The problems include, variously, high cost and short storage life of the radiolabeled reagents, the requirement for special equipment for detection of the signal, the health hazard to laboratory personnel, and the expense and inconvenience of disposal of the radioactive waste. Recently, a sensitive and convenient method for detection has been introduced, which does not require the use of radioisotopes. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA makes use of enzymes as signalling moieties. The sensitivity of ELISA is limited, in part, by the number of enzyme molecules that can be attached to the analyte specific moiety used. When an analyte moiety is capable of growth e.g. a bacterium , it is often advantageous to grow it, either The ability of bacteria to grow has made them useful signalling moieties for the detection of other moieties. When the ability of the bacterium to grow is dependent upon the analyte moiety e.g. when the bacteria are auxotrophic for the analyte moiety , the growth of the bacteria can be used to detect the presence of the analyte moiety. The growth of the bacteria is stoichiometrically related to the amount of analyte moiety present. Of course, this type of bioassay is limited to specific signalling moiety analyte moiety pairs. Farrell, C. et al., Scand. J. of Immun. 4 7 , 673 680 1975 describe a radioimmunoassay wherein a solid phase C1q and ³²P labeled Protein A rich WO A 8 504 189 which is a document according to Art. 54 3 4 EPC discloses the use of bacteriophages as agents in a method for recognizing and identifying molecules or cellular materials. An object of this invention is to provide a method for detecting analyte moieties by means of a signalling moiety capable of aggrandizement growth, replication, proliferation . Another object of this invention is to provide an assay composition with which an analyte moiety can be detected by means of a signalling moiety capable of aggrandizement. In accordance with this invention, there is provided a method for detecting an analyte in a sample which comprises In this invention, the following defined terms are employed A method is provided for detecting analyte moieties by forming a complex between an analyte moiety and an analyte specific moiety and detecting the analyte moiety by means of a signalling moiety that is capable of independent aggrandizement. Independent aggrandizement means that the signalling moiety is not directly dependent on the analyte moiety itself for aggrandizement. In the formats in which the analyte moiety itself is the signalling moiety, each signalling moiety is not dependent on the presence of other analyte moieties for aggrandizement. The signalling moiety can be attached directly or indirectly to the analyte moiety analyte specific moiety complex. The various embodiments are discussed herein below. Viable signalling moieties capable of aggrandizement are moieties that can grow, replicate, or proliferate in a suitable environment when supplied with the proper nutrients. The nutrients comprise all metabolic requirements of the signalling moiety and can include intact cells. The advantage of using a signalling moiety that can aggrandize is that it permits the generation of more signalling moieties thus providing for more signal. Viable signalling moieties include, for example, phages, viruses, bacteria, protozoa, rickettsiae, fungi, yeast, algae, microorganisms, prokaryote cells, eukaroyote cells, tumor cells, plant cells, and animal cells. Preferred viable signalling moieties are phages, viruses, bacteria, and yeast. Particularly preferred are bacteria and yeast. Viable signalling moieties can be detected by observing the actual moieties themselves or the metabolites produced by the moieties. Signalling moieties that are bacteria may themselves be observed by the presence, for example, of colonies on a solid nutrient plate or turbidity in a liquid medium. Bacteria that can grow under special conditions, e.g., elevated temperatures or low pH or that are readily distinguishable from other viable signalling moieties e.g. they produce colonies with distinctive morphologies or colors have an additional advantage in that they can be observed in the presence of other signalling moieties not able to grow under these conditions or that do not exhibit these distinctive characteristics. An example of a bacterial species which forms distinctive colonies is Viable signalling moieties produce metabolites which can be detected to verify the presence of the signalling moiety. They comprise most cellular or viral products and components. They include, for example, proteins, hormones, antibodies, enzymes, epitopes, antigens, polypeptides, peptides, amino acids, nucleic acids, polynucleotides, nucleotides, nucleosides, bases, carbohydrates, sugars, starches, lipids, fatty acid esters, glycerols, fatty acids, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, lipoproteins, vitamins, steroids, drugs, flavones, antibiotics, terpenes, purines and pyrimidines. Preferred metabolites are proteins, polynucleotides, and polysaccharides. Particularly preferred are epitopes, antigens, enzymes, and polynucoeotides. Enzymes include, for example, hydrolases, esterases, phosphatases, peroxidases, catatases, glycosidases, oxidoreductases, proteases, lipases, and nucleases. Particularly preferred are phosphatases, peroxidases and oxidoreductases. Detection of a metabolite can be by various means. A metabolite can be detected by means of a physical property, or a chemical property. Physical properties include, for example, all characteristics such as fluorescence emission, ultra violet absorption, molecular weight, electrophoretic mobility, and chromotographic behavior. Chemical properties include, all characteristics which enable the metabolite to react with, interact with, or bind to other substances. The chemical property can be one that permits conversion of the metabolite into a compound that can be detected, one that enables the metabolite to convert a substance into a detectable product, or one that permits the attachment of the metabolite to a detectable substance. Examples of metabolites that can be detected by the above methods include cofactors by means of their uv spectrum, peptides by means of their retention times on HPLC, ribonucleotides by means of orcinol, carboxylic acids by means of pH indicators, nucleic acids by means of ethidium bromide, epitopes by means of antibodies attached to a fluorescent moiety, lysozymes by means of plaques, and phosphatase enzymes by means of chromogenic substrates such as p nitrophenyl phosphate. The viable signalling moiety capable of aggrandizement is part of the analyte signalling entity. The signalling moiety can be the analyte moiety, the analyte specific moiety, or another moiety attached to either the analyte moiety or the analyte specific moiety. The signalling analyte entity is adaptable to four formats. In the first format, the viable signalling moiety is the analyte moiety, in the second format, the viable signalling moiety is the analyte specific moiety, in the third format, the viable signalling moiety is a separate moiety attached directly or indirectly to the analyte moiety, and in the fourth format, the viable signalling moiety is a separate moiety attached directly or indirectly to the analyte specific moiety. The third and fourth formats are the only embodiments presently claimed. An example of a viable signalling moiety that is also the analyte moiety is when an antibody against An example of a viable signalling moiety that is also the analyte specific moiety is when an IgG antibody is the immobilized analyte moiety and An example of a viable signalling moiety that is attached to an analyte moiety is when goat anti rabbit IgG Fab 2 is the immobilized analyte specific moiety and rabbit IgG is the analyte moiety. An example of a viable signalling moiety that is attached to an analyte specific moiety is when biotinylated bovine serum albumin is the immobilized analyte moiety, avidin is the analyte specific moiety, and All the nutrients can be provided to the signalling moiety preformed, or alternatively one or more required nutrients can be provided in the form of precursors that are converted into nutrients by means of one or more catalysts. The catalyst can be part of the analyte signalling entity, or can be a separate unattached entity. The method in all four formats generally comprises, but is not limited to, immobilizing either the analyte moiety or the analyte specific moiety to a support, and treating the support so as to prevent non specific binding to the support of any of the moieties comprising the analyte signalling entity. The analyte signalling entity is then constructed on the support by contacting the components other than the one initially immobilized with the support, either sequentially or together. The components of the analyte signalling entity may or may not be partially assembled before contact with the support. Components not specifically bound to the support are removed for example, by washing the support. When a moiety other than the analyte or the analyte specific moiety is the signalling moiety, it is attached to either the analyte moiety or the analyte specific moiety. The attachment can be by covalent means or by non covalent means. The signalling moiety can be attached directly to either the analyte moiety or analyte specific moiety, or indirectly to either the analyte moiety or analyte specific moiety by means of a signalling moiety specific moiety and or one or more bridging moieties. The signalling moiety can be attached to either the analyte moiety or the analyte specific moiety before formation of the analyte moiety analyte specific moiety complex, or it can be attached to the analyte moiety or the analyte specific moiety after formation of the analyte moiety analyte specific moiety complex. Similarly, if a bridging moiety and or signalling moiety specific moiety is included, it can be attached to the signalling moiety before being attached to either the analyte moiety or the analyte specific moiety, or after its being attached to the analyte moiety or analyte specific moiety. Any support that can bind either the analyte moiety or the analyte specific moiety, and any blocking agent that can prevent non specific binding of other moieties to the support are suitable. Suitable supports include nitrocellulose, nylon membranes, glass slides, polystyrene, polypylene or polycarbonate. A preferred support is nitrocellulose, and a preferred blocking agent is bovine serum albumin BSA . Generally, binding of the analyte moiety or the analyte specific moiety to the support is by non covalent means, although in some instances covalent binding is desirable. A requirement of this invention for all embodiments is that the signalling moiety be capable of aggrandizement. However, this does not mean that the invention is limited to situations where aggrandizement is actually carried out. In certain instances the signalling moiety may be detectable without any aggrandizement at all particularly if a large amount of analyte moiety is present. In other instances some aggrandizement is necessary to permit detection. In yet other instances the signalling moiety is aggrandized until visible colonies, plaques, or polymers are formed. The methods of this invention will often permit detection of even as little as one analyte moiety. The methods are versatile, reasonably rapid, have a simple protocol, use reagents which can be standardized and provided in commercial kits, and allow for rapid screening of a large number of samples. The analyte moiety is the entity whose presence is to be detected. The analyte moiety must have an informational portion that the analyte specific moiety can recognize. Analyte moieties include, for example, microorganisms, fungi, algae, plant cells, animal cells, tumor cells, ligands, receptors, antibodies, antigens, proteins, hormones, polysaccharides, polypeptides, nucleic acids and polynucleotides. The analyte moiety can be derived from serum, tissue extracts, cell smears, urine, sputum, feces, saliva, puss, semen, fermentation broths, culture media, water aliquots, environmental samples, and foods. It is recognized that experimental manipulations may be necessary to expose the informational portion of the analyte moiety to the recognition site of the analyte specific moiety. Thus, membranes may have to be ruptured in order to obtain access to cellular components, and polynucleotides may have to be denatured to generate single stranded regions. These methods are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The analyte specific moiety is the moiety that complexes with the analyte moiety by recognizing an informational portion of the analyte moiety. The analyte specific moiety is thus selective for the analyte moiety. Generally, the complex is formed by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, or a combination of interactions. Analyte specific moieties comprise, for example, microorganisms, ligands, receptors, antigens, antibodies, proteins, hormones, polynucleotides, amino acids, enzymes, enzyme substrates, enzyme inhibitors, and lipids. The signalling moiety specific moiety is a moiety that is capable of complexing to a particular signalling moiety. Its function is to attach a signalling moiety to another moiety. A bridging moiety attaches any moiety to another moiety. These moieties can be attached to the other moieties covalently or non covalently. Signalling moiety specific moieties include, for example, antibodies, epitopes, antigens, receptors, polynucleotides, lectins, agglutinins, polysaccharides, co enzymes, and lipids. Bridging moieties include, for example, microorganisms, polymers, biotin, biotinylated compounds, lectins, agglutinins, avidin, antibodies, nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, saccharides, and difunctional organic compounds. The number of moieties comprising the signalling analyte entity may vary. The entity may contain two moieties analyte and analyte specific moieties or many moieties analyte, analyte specific, bridging one or more signalling moiety specific, and signalling moiety . The actual number is not important for this invention. This invention also relates to compositions comprising analyte moieties, analyte specific moieties, and signalling moieties. Compositions are known, for example, where The invention is versatile and reagents for carrying out the method can be formulated in kits. The kits would comprise, in part, the desired analyte specific moiety, a signalling moiety, and means for attaching the signalling moiety to the analyte specific moiety. If the analyte moiety to be detected is itself capable of aggrandizement, then the kit need not include a signalling moiety. In the examples, reference is made to the following materials In this example, the analyte In this example, the analyte specific moiety In this example, neither the analyte moiety rabbit IgG nor the analyte specific moiety goat anti rabbit IgG Fab 2 is capable of aggrandizement. The signalling moiety, In this example, neither the analyte biotinylated bovine serum albumin nor the analyte specific moiety avidin was capable of aggrandizement. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that various changes, modifications, and variations may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the present claims.
