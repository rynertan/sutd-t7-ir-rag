## Description
A PARTIALLY FABRICATED ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL The present invention relates to an electrolytic unit fabricated from a plurality of parts assembled in a unique way. A plurality of such units positioned in operable combination are particularly useful in the production of chlorine and caustic in an electrolytic cell. As used herein electrolytic cell means an assembly which at least includes an anode in an anode compartment and a cathode in a cathode compartment, wherein the anode compartment and the cathode compartment are separated by an ion exchange active substantially hydraulically impermeable membrane. Electrolytic unit means an assembly which at least includes two electrode components separated by a central support element. The electrode components in an electrolytic unit may be oppositely charged, as is the case in a bipolar unit, or similarly charged, as is the case of a monopolar unit. Thus, monopolar units could be either anode or cathode units. Electrode component means an electrode or an element associated with an electrode such as a current distributor grid or current collector. Chlorine and caustic are large volume, basic chemicals which are most frequently produced electrolytically from an aqueous solution of an alkali metal chloride in electrolytic cells. Recently, a variety of technological advances have occurred to minimize the gap between the anode and the cathode of an electrolytic cell to minimize the electrical resistance of the electrolytic cell, thus allowing the electrolytic cell to operate more efficiently. Advances include such things as dimensionally stable anodes, ion exchange membranes, depolarized electrodes, zero gap cell configurations, and solid polymer electrolyte membranes. There are two major types of electrolytic cells commonly used for the production of chlorine and caustic, i.e., monopolar and bipolar cells. A bipolar cell consists of several electrochemical units in a series, in which each unit, except the two end or terminal units, acts as an anode on one side and a cathode on the opposing side. Electrolytic units are seal ably separated by an ion exchange active membrane, thereby forming an electrolytic cell, or series of electrolytic cells. Electrical energy is introduced into an end cell at one end of a series of bipolar cells, passes through the series of bipolar cells, and is removed from the end cell at the other end of the cell series. An alkali metal halide solution is fed into the anode compartment s where a halogen gas is generated at the anode. Alkali metal ions are selectively transported through the ion exchange active membrane s into the cathode compartment s where alkali metal hydroxides are formed. Monopolar electrolytic cells comprise at least two terminal cells and a plurality of anode units and cathode units alternately positioned therebetween.The monopolar units are separated by an ion exchange active membrane, thus forming a plurality of monopolar cells. Each unit is equipped with at least one inlet, through which electrolyte may be fed to the unit, and with at least one outlet, through which liquids and gases may be removed from the unit. Each unit is electrically connected to a power supply. Power is fed to one monopolar electrolytic unit and is removed from at least one adjacent unit. To take advantage of the new technological advances, a variety of electrolytic unit designs have been proposed. However, many of these are quite complicated and require the use of expensive materials.An uncomplicated electrolytic unit employing readily available, inexpensive materials would be highly desirable. It is the object of this invention to provide such an electrolytic unit. The invention basically resides in a method of assembling an electrolytic unit comprised of a plurality of parts connected in a manner to form the unit. This unit is substantially planar and includes an electric current transmission element hereinafter referred to as an ECTE comprising a planar support portion, a frame like flange portion attached to the peripheral edge of the support portion, and a plurality of bosses projecting outwardly from each side of the support portion. The opposing sides of the so formedECTE may be flattened prior to, during, or after complete assembly of the parts if needed. A side liner is then applied to at least a portion of at least one side of the assembled ECTE. The electrolytic unit of the present invention may be used as either a monopolar or a bipolar unit. The frame like flange portion is composed of at least one component and has an internal surface which seal ably receives and which is attached to at least a portion of the external peripheral edges of the planar support portion. The bosses are preferably spaced apart in a manner to rigidly support at least one electrode component. The frequency of bosses, whether of round cross section or of elongated or rib type cross section, per unit area of the electrode component associated therewith may vary within wide limits. The invention can be better understood by reference to the drawings illustrating the invention and wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts in the different drawing figures, and wherein Figure 1 is an exploded, partially broken away perspective view of one embodiment of the electrolytic unit of the present invention Figure 2 is an exploded, sectional side view of one embodiment of the electrolytic unit shown inFigure 1 Figure 3 is a cross sectional side view of a plurality of electrolytic units positioned in operable combination, forming a series of electrolytic cells Figure 4 is a cross sectional side view of an electrolytic unit having a side liner made from a plurality of pieces. With particular reference to Figures 1 to 3, the present invention employs an electric current transmission element ECTE 14 as one component of an unlined electrolytic unit 10 or lined electrolytic unit 11. Preferably, ECTE 14 comprises a generally planar support portion 17 which has sufficient structural integrity to provide a support for a plurality of bosses 18 and 18A, a frame like flange portion 16 and side liners 26 or 26A, if liners are used. ECTE 14 is substantially more massive and more rigid than the side liner 26 or 26A and any electrode components 36, 36A, 46, or 46A normally used in electrolytic cells. ECTE 14 may be made from a variety of materials which meet the requirements outlined above. Preferably, however, the material is a metal selected from ferrous metals such as iron, grey iron, malleable iron, ductile iron, steel and stainless steel, and other metals such as nickel, aluminum, molybdenum, copper, magnesium, lead, alloys of each and alloys thereof. Preferably, ECTE 14 is constructed from ferrous metals whose primary constituent is iron. Most preferably, the ECTE is constructed from ductile iron because of its stability, low cost and the ready availability of ductile iron with very accurate dimensions. In those cases where the electrolytic unit 10 or 11 is used as a bipolar electrolytic unit, the bosses 18 and 18A should be sufficiently conductive to transmit electrical energy through its mass, or portions of its mass, in a direction perpendicular to the planar support portion 17. The electrical conduction occurs through the bosses 18 and 18A, rather than through the mass of the support portion 17 except in the case where the bosses 18 and 18A are offset, then the support portion 17 must be sufficiently conductive to transmit electrical energy through its mass, or portions of its mass. In those cases where the electrolytic unit 10, 11 is used as a monopolar electrolytic unit, the support portion 17 should be sufficiently conductive to transmit electrical energy throughout substantially its entire mass. This allows an electrical connection from a power source to be connected to the support portion 17 itself and distribute the electrical energy to the various points of an electrode component in electrical contact with the support portion 17. Regardless of whether the ECTE 14 is used as a monopolar or as a bipolar unit, it is possible to construct the support portion 17 from metals that are readily available, and generally inexpensive without having to be overly concerned with the resistivity of the metal. This is possible because of the large mass and cross sectional area of the support portion 17 which is sufficiently large in cross sectional area to minimize its electrical resistance. The fact that the support portion 17 has a large cross sectional area allows the use of metals having a higher resistivity than could be used in configurations of the prior art.Thus, ferrous metals such as iron, steel, ductile iron and grey iron and malleable iron are perfectly suitable for use in the present invention. More specifically, metals having a resistivity as high or higher than copper may be economically used to form the support portion 17. More economically, metals having a resistivity greater than about 10 micro ohms cm may be used.Most economically, metals having resistivities as high as, or higher, than about 50 micro ohms cm may be used. When the electrolytic unit 10, 11 of the present invention is used as a monopolar unit, the support portion 17 may have one or more passageways connecting opposite sides thereof. The passageways allow electrolyte or gases to pass from one side of the support portion 17 to the other side. Such passageways should occupy no more than about 60 volume percent of the total volume of the support portion. The openings allow less metal to be used in forming the support portion 17, thus making the cell more economical. In addition, openings can be spaced to direct current to certain portions of the cell. A plurality of bosses 18 and 18A are attached to opposite sides of the support portion 17. These bosses project a predetermined distance outwardly from the support portion 17 into an area that will ultimately become an electrolyte compartment. The bosses 18 and 18A are capable of being electrically connected either directly to an electrode component 36, 36A, 46, or 46A, or indirectly to the electrode component through a side liner 26, 26A. Preferably the ends of the bosses 18 and 18A lie in the same geometrical plane, respectively and are substantially solid. They may, however, contain internal voids, as a result of casting. The bosses 18 and 18A may be positioned in a back to back relationship with each other across the support portion 17. Optionally, they may be offset from each other across the support portion 17. They may be positioned in a variety of other cross sectional configurations from each other. The bosses 18 and 18A may be made from the same metal as the metal used for the support portion 17. Optionally, the bosses may be made from a metal different from that used to construct the planar support portion 17. Preferably, the bosses 18 and 18A are made from ferrous metal such as iron, grey iron, malleable iron, ductile iron, steel, stainless steel, or from molybdenum, nickel, aluminum, copper, magnesium, lead, alloys of each and alloys thereof. Most preferably, the bosses are constructed from ductile iron because of its stability, low cost and ready availability. The bosses 18 and 18A are preferably spaced apart in a fashion so that they can rigidly support any electrode components 36, 36A, 46, or 46A desired for use in the electrolytic cell. The distance between the bosses on each side of the support portion will generally depend upon the plane resistivity of the particular electrode element used. For thinner and or highly resistive electrode elements, the spacing of the bosses will be less, thus providing a more dense multiplicity of points for electrical contact. For thicker and or less resistive electrode components, the spacing of the bosses may be greater. Normally the spacing between the bosses is within 5 to 30 cm although smaller or larger spacings may be used depending on overall design conslderations. The bosses 18 and 18A may be conveniently welded or bonded to the support portion 17 or they may be screwed into the support portion as shown by reference number 93 in Figures 2 and 3. Either way, it is desirable to make the attachment such that the electrical contact between the support portion 17 and the bosses is maximized. In the case of an unlined electrolytic unit 10 or in the case where only one liner is used, it is preferable that the bosses are welded, even though they are screwed into or bonded to the support portion 17. In the case of a lined electrolytic unit 11, it is preferable that the bosses not be welded, but could contain a tack weld. The bosses have a flat surface 28 and 28A which is machined prior to, during, or after assembly of the unit. These surfaces are adapted to be attached to a liner or to an electrode component by means of intermediate coupons 30, 30A, 31 or 31A . Surrounding the peripheral edges of the support portion 17 is a frame like flange portion 16.It is a window frame like structure having a thickness greater than, or at least equal to, the thickness of a boss containing support portion 17. Preferably, the flange portion 16 extends further from the plane of the support portion 17 than do the ends of the bosses 18 and 18A. This provides a space for electrode components 36, 36A, 46, or 46A that will be present when the electrolytic units 10, 11 of the present invention are stacked adjacent to each other in operable combination.Preferably the thickness of the flange portion 16 is at least about 2 to 6 time. greater than the thickness of the support portion 17. More preferably, the flange portion is about 60 to 70 mm thick when the support portion 17 is about 20 to 25 mm thick. The flange portion 16 may be a single or unitary, picture frame like structure or it may be a plurality of pieces or sections joined together to form a complete frame like structure around the peripheral edges of the support portion 17. The frame like flange portion can be made of a metal selected from the same metals employed for the planar support portion. It is also contemplated that the metal of the flange portion can be a different metal from the metal used for the planar support portion.For example, if the planar support portion is made of a ferrous metal, the flange portion can be made of copper or any one of the other metals that can be suitably employed for the planar support portion. Optionally, the flange portion can be made of a synthetic resinous material. Without intending to be limited by the specific synthetic resinous meterials hereinafter delineated, examples of such suitable materials include polyethylene polypropylene polyvinylchloride chlorinated polyvinyl chloride acrylonitrile, polystyrene, polysulfone, styrene acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene copolymers epoxy vinyl esters polyesters and fluoroplastics and copolymers thereof. It is preferred that a material such as polypropylene be used for the flange portion since it produces a shape with adequate structural integrity at elevated temperatures, is readily available, and is relatively inexpensive with respect to other suitable materials. The plastic flange portion can be produced by any of a number of processes known well to those skilled in the art of plastic molding. Such molding processes include, for example, injection molding, compression molding, transfer molding, and casting. Of these processes, injection molding has been found to satisfactorily produce a structure with adequate strength for use in an electrochemical cell. The flange portion provides sealing surfaces 16A and 16C which lie in approximately the same plane as do the flat ends 28, 28A of the bosses 18 and 18A after they have been attached to the support portion 17. .If the flange portion is composed of separate pieces, they may be attached to the support portion before or after the bosses are attached to the support portion. The support portion and bosses may be flattened machined before or after the flange portion is attached to the support portion if needed. If the electrolytic unit is to be used as a bipolar unit, the flange portion 16 need not be made from an electrically conductive material, because it will not need to conduct electricity. However, if the electrolytic unit is to be used as a monopolar unit, the flange portion, or at least a section of the flange portion, is electrically conductive. The flange portion provides a convenient means to transmit electrical energy into and out of the electrolytic units 10, 11 present in an operating series of units. The flange portion can also be made from a non conductive material and provided with passageways which pass through it to provide a pathway for electrical conductors to pass through the flange portion to connect to the planar support portion to conduct electrical energy into and out of the monopolar unit. The flange portion 16, if not formed as a one piece unitary body with the support portion 17, is preferably firmly attached to the support portion. A firm attachment assures the dimensional stability of the electrolytic units and maintains the desired gap between electrode components of adjoining units. If the flange portion is made of a metal, it is attached to the support portion by welding. When the electrolytic unit is to be used as a bipolar unit, and the unit is not lined, it is particularly important to sealably weld the flange portion to the support portion to prevent the flow of fluids from one side of the support portion to the other side. When a plurality of electrolytic units 10, 11 are assembled in operable combination, an ion exchange active membrane 27 and 27A is positioned between adjoining electrolytic units 10, 11. A membrane is used between either bipolar or monopolar electrolytic units. In either case, the membrane separates one electrode compartment from an adjacent electrode compartment. The membrane 27 and 27A suitable for use with the present invention may contain a variety of ion exchange active sites. For example, they may contain sulfonic or carboxylic acid ion exchange active sites. Optionally, the membrane may be a bi layer membrane and have one type of ion exchange active site in one layer and another type of ion exchange active sites in the other layer. The membrane may be reinforced to impair deforming during electrolysis or it may be unreinforced to maximize the electrical conductivity through the membrane. Ion exchange active membranes suitable for use with electrolytic cells of the present invention are well known in the art. Other electrode components which may be used in conjunction with the present invention include current collectors, spacers, mattresses and other elements known to those skilled in the art. Special elements or assemblies for zero gap configurations or solid polymer electrolyte membranes may be used. Also, the electrolytic units of the present invention may be adapted for a gas chamber for use in conjunction with a gas consuming electrode, sometimes called a depolarized electrode. The gas chamber is required in addition to the liquid electrolyte compartments. A variety of electrode components which may be used in the present invention are well known to those skilled in the art and are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,457,823 4,457,815 4,444,623 4,340,452 4,444,641 4,444,639 4,457,822 and 4,448,662. A preferred method of integrally forming theECTE or planar support portion is by sand casting molten metal, preferably casting molten ferrous metal.Other methods of forming the ECTE or support portion include die casting, powdered metal pressing and sintering, hot isostatic pressing, hot forging, and cold forging. Furthermore, it is within the scope of the invention in forming the ECTE or planar support portion 17 to utilize metal forming techniques which include the use of inserts, chills, and cores in the integral formation of the support portion. In fact, the particular location of chills of particular metals has resulted in the surprising result of not only making a more uniform casting but simultaneously producing an ECTE with better electrical conductive properties. In so doing, these chills then turn into inserts, of course. For certainty of definition, the meaning of chills, inserts and cores in metal structure forming will now be given as these terms are used by the present inventors. Chills are items placed in the mold which act as aids in casting the part. Their primary purpose is to control the cooling rate of the molten metal at specific locations in the mold. By controlling the cooling of the molten metal, metal shrinkage can more accurately be controlled thereby improving part quality through reduced imperfections and defects. Chills may or may not become an integral part of the casting and may, in some cases, act as inserts as well. Inserts are items placed in the mold to aid in the function of the mold aid in the forming of the part or which will become a functional part of the finished article. They retain their identify, to varying degrees, after the formation is complete. They are usually made of a metal, although any other suitable material may be used. Inserts may, in some cases, act as chills as well. Cores are items placed in the mold which serve to eliminate metal in unwanted areas of a casting.Cores are used in the mold where it would be impractical or impossible to form the mold in such a way as to eliminate the unwanted metal. A typical example would be a core used to create the internal cavity of a cast metal body. Cores may, in some cases, act as chills as well. The particularly useful chills which turn into inserts to increase the electrical conductivity of the support portion are located transversely to the support portion and run into the bosses. The preferred inserts or chills used are made of a solid metal that has the bulk of the metal of the support portion formed around them. It may be advantageous to have openingspassing all the way through the support portion in a monopolar cell unit to improve circulation. Such opening would be of no significant disadvantage in a bipolar cell unit so long as the support portion has at least one liner on one of its sides to prevent the mixing of anolyte or catholyte from the adjacent electrolyte compartments. The liner 26 or 26A may be constructed of one piece or it may be constructed of a plurality of pieces bonded together. Liner 26 is shown as a one piece liner, while liner 26A is shown as a plurality of pieces. A one piece liner is preferred because it minimizes the possibility of leaks, allowing fluids to contact the support portion. Preferably the liner is of a thickness sufficient to be substantially completely hydraulically impermeable. One piece side liners are preferably formed with a minimum of stresses in them to minimize warpage.Avoiding these stresses in the liner may be accomplished by hot forming the liner in a press at an elevated temperature of from 4820C to 7040C. Both the liner metal and the metal press are heated to this elevated temperature before pressing the liner into the desired shape. The liner is held in the heated press and cooled under a programmed cycle to prevent formation of stresses in it as it cools to room temperature. Liners 26 or 26A suitable for use in chlor alkali cathode compartments are preferably selected from ferrous metals, nickel, stainless steel, chromium, monel, and alloys thereof. Liners suitable for use in chlor alkali anode compartments are preferably selected from titanium, vanadium, tantalum, columbium, hafnium, zirconium, and alloys thereof. The liner may be coextensive with only the support portion 17 of the ECTE containing the bosses 18 and 18A, or it may be coextensive with the entire length and width of the ECTE. To assure the maximum physical and electrical contact between the liner and the bosses, it is preferred for the liner to be welded to the flat ends 28, 28A of the bosses 18 and 18A. Optionally, the liner can be welded not only to the flat ends of the bosses, but at various other places where the two contact each other.Capacitor discharge welding is a preferred welding technique to be used to weld the liner to the bosses 18 and 18A. For fluid sealing purposes between the membrane 27 or 27A, and sealing surfaces 16A or 16C of flange portion 16, it is preferred that the liners 26 or 26A are formed in the shape of a pan with an off set lip 42 or 42A extending around its periphery. Lip 42 and 42A fits flush against the sealing surfaces 16A or 16C.The periphery of membrane 27 or 27A fits flush against liner lip 42, and a peripheral gasket 44 fits flush against the other side of the periphery of the membrane 27 or 27A. In a series of electrolytic units, the gasket 44 fits flush against the lateral face 42A of the liner 26A and flush against the lateral surface 16C of the flange portion 16 when there is no liner. If the liners 26 and 26A are made of titanium and the ECTE is made of a ferrous metal, they may be connected by resistance welding or capacitor discharge welding. Resistance or capacitor discharge welding is accomplished indirectly by welding the liners to the flat ends 28 and 28A of the bosses 18 and 18A through metal intermediates generally referred to as wafers or coupons. Vanadium is one metal which is weldably compatible with titanium and ferrous metals. Weldably compatible means that one weldable metal will form a ductile solid solution with another weldable metal upon the welding of the two metals together. Titanium and ferrous metals are not normally compatible with vanadium.Hence, vanadium wafers 30 and 30A are used as an intermediate metal between the ferrous metal bosses 18 and 18A and the titanium liners 26 and 26A to accomplish the welding of them together to form an electrical connection between the liners and the bosses as well as to form a mechanical support means for the liners 26 and 26A. Preferably, a second metal intermediate or wafer 31 and 31A is used and placed between wafers 30 and 30A and the liners 26 and 26A. The second wafer is preferable because when only one wafer is used, it has been discovered that the corrosive materials contacting the liner during operation of the cell to produce chlorine and caustic seem to permeate into the titaniumvanadium weld and corrode the weld. The corrosive materials also permeate into the body of the ECTE and corrode it. Rather than use a thicker liner, it is much more economical to insert a second wafer 31 and 31A of a sufficient thickness to minimize the possibility of the corrosive materials permeating into theECTE. To introduce reactants into the electrolytic cells formed when a plurality of electrolytic units 10, 11 are stacked in operable combination, a plurality of nozzles not shown are preferably present in each electrolytic unit. Although a variety of designs and configurations may be used, a preferred design is as follows. A plurality of metal nozzles are formed, for example by investment casting. The nozzle casting is then machined to the desired size. A number of slots are machined into each flange portion 16 at a plurality of desired locations to receive the nozzles. The slots are of a size to correspond to the thickness of the nozzle to be inserted into the slot, to assure a seal when the elements of the electrolytic cell are ultimately assembled. If a liner 26 or 26A is used, it is cut to fit around the nozzle. The nozzle is preferably attached to the liner 26 or 26A, for example, by welding. The liner nozzle combination is then placed into the electrolytic unit and the liner caps 32 or 32A are then welded to the bosses 18 and 18A. When a plurality of electrolytic units 10, 11 are assembled adjacent to each other, gaskets 44 are preferably positioned between the units. The gaskets serve three main functions 1 sealing, 2 electrical insulation, and 3 setting the electrode gap. There are a variety of suitable gasket 44 materials that may be used, such as, for example, ethylenepropylenediene terpolymer, chlorinated polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, perfluoroalkoxy resin, or rubber. Although only one gasket 44 is shown, the invention encompasses the use of gaskets on both sides of membrane 27 or 27A. Adjacent to the ECTE, or the liner 26 or 26A, if liners are used, is an electrode component 36, 36A, 46, or 46A which may be attached or pressed against the liner or ECTE 14. Preferably, the electrode component is coextensive with the support portion 17 and does not extend over the flange portion 16. Otherwise, it would be difficult to seal adjacent electrolytic units 10, 11 when they are placed in operable combination. Electrode components which may be employed are preferably foraminous structures which are substantially flat and may be made of a sheet of expanded metal perforated plate, punched plate or woven metal wire. Optionally, the electrode components may be current collectors which contact an electrode or they may be electrodes. Electrodes may optionally have a catalytically active coating on their surface. The electrode components may be welded to the bosses or to the liner, if a liner is used. Preferably, the electrode components are welded because the electrical contact is better. The electrode components 36, 36A, 46, or 46A preferably have their edges rolled inwardly toward the support portion 17 and away from the ion exchange active membrane 27 and 27A. This is done to prevent the sometimes jagged edges of these electrode components from contacting the ion exchange active membrane and tearing it. The electrolytic unit 10, 11 may be prepared in a variety of ways using a variety of elements. Each of the basic elements used in making the ECTE 14, i.e., the planar support portion 17 the peripheral flange portion 16 and the bosses 18 and 18A may be composed of a plurality of pieces or sections. For example, the support portion 17 may be made of a plurality of pieces joined together. Likewise, the flange portion 16 may be constructed of a plurality of pieces or sections joined together. Similarly, the bosses may be single piece units that pass through the support portion or they may be partial units which do not pass through the support portion but are merely attached to one surface or opposite surfaces thereof. The basic elements may be assembled by first attaching the bosses 18 and 18A to the support portion 17 and then attaching the flange portion 16 to the peripheral edges of the support portion 17. In another sequence the flange portion or portions are first attached to the support portion or portions and then the bosses are attached. Another method for assemblying the electrolytic units of the present invention is by preparing for example by casting the basic elements into sub combinations, followed by attaching the remaining elements to the sub assembly. For example, a unitized support portion 17 having at least a portion of the bosses 18 and 18A is formed, as by casting. The remaining portion of the bosses 18 and 18A, if any, and the flange portion 16 may then be attached. Alternatively, a support portion 17 having at least a portion of the bosses 18 and 18A may be formed by casting.Then, the flange portion 16 may be attached, followed by the bosses 18 and 18A being attached. To assure that the electrolytic unit 10, 11 is as planar as possible, it is optional to flatten or plane the surfaces of the assembled, or partially assembled ECTE. Specifically, ECTE may be flattened at any one, or more, of the various steps of assembly of the ECTE components. For example, it may be flattened after all of the bosses have been attached to one side of the support portion after only a portion of the bosses have been attached to the support portion, after all or a portion of the bosses have been attached to the support portion but before the flange portion has been attached or after all the bosses and the flange portions has been attached. The ECTE may be flattened using a variety of techniques well known to those skilled in the art, such as abrasive belt grinding, and mechanical milling.Preferably, the ECTE is sufficiently flattened such that when two electrolytic units 10, 11 are mated with each other in operable combination, the number of leaks is minimized. For use in chlor alkali electrochemical cells, it is most preferred for the ECTE to have a flatness deviation of less than about 0.4 mm throughout its entire mass. Attaching the bosses 18 and 18A to the support portion may be done using a variety of techniques. For example, the support portion 17 may be cast as a solid unit and later have holes drilled and tapped through the thickness, or partially through the thickness thereof. The bosses can be threaded and then screwed into the holes in the support portion from both sides. Optionally, the bosses can be threaded through half their length and then threaded half way through the support portion. Preferably, the ends of the bosses are machine flattened before they are attached to the support portion. Another way for attaching the bosses 18 and 18A is by welding. Preferably, the bosses and the support portion 17 are made from metals that are weldably compatible. If the two metals are not weldably compatible, an intermediate metal wafer, weldably compatible with both metals, may be inserted between the two metals. Preferably, the bosses are welded slowly so that warpage of the support portion 17 caused by the heat of the welding is minimized. If desired7 a liner may be positioned over only the area of the ECTE which will be contacted with a corrosive electrolyte. Optionally, a liner 26 or 26A may be positioned on only one side or on both sides of the support portion 17. The liner 26 or 26A may be one piece or, it may be a plurality of pieces bonded together,It should, however, be of a substantially completely hydraulically impermeable construction. The liner 26 or 26A may be coextensive with the support portion 17, or it may be coextensive with the entire length and width of ECTE 14. Preferably, the electrode component 36, 36A, 46 or 46A is coextensive with the support portion 17 and does not extend over the flange portion 17. Otherwise, it would be difficult to seal adjacent electrolytic units when they are placed in operable combination. A particularly suitable way for fabricating a support portion is by using a flat workpiece upon which to support the support portion which has previously had holes drilled and tapped therein to receive the bosses. A plurality of bosses are cut to equal length and each boss is provided with a threaded portion in the midportion thereof. The unthreaded end portions are of differing diameters. One end portion is smaller in diameter than the other portion and has a diameter which is smaller than the diameter of the hole drilled in the support portion. The smaller end portion of a boss is passed through the hole and until the threaded portion of the boss contacts the threaded portion of the hole. The bosses are threaded into the threaded holes in the support portion until they touch the flat workpiece. In this manner, it is easy to make sure that all of the bosses extend the same length from the support portion.EXAMPLE 1 A 122 cm x 244 cm bipolar, flat plate filter press type ion exchange membrane cell was constructed as follows. A 122 cm x 244 cm steel plate having a thickness of 1.27 cm was drilled and tapped so that it had 116 holes in it in a square pattern with each hole having a diameter of 25 mm. The steel plate was used as the support portion of the ECTE and had welded around its peripheral edges a 19 mm thick, 70 mm wide low carbon steel picture frame type flange portion. A plurality of 25 mm threaded steel rods were screwed firmly into each of the 116 holes. On the side destined to become the anode side, a vanadium wafer was positioned over the end of each rod and a titanium cap was then placed over the rod and vanadium wafer. The cap was welded to each of the 116 rods, through the vanadium wafer. On the side destined to become the cathode side, a nickel cap was placed over and welded to each of the 116 rods. Since nickel can be relatively easily welded to steel, no intermediate wafer was needed on the cathode side. The vanadium wafer was about 0.13 mm thick. The cap was about 0.9 mm thick. For corrosion protection, the anode compartment was lined with a 0.9 mm thick titanium liner which was made of a flat titanium sheet welded to a U shaped titanium side cover on all four peripheral sides. The titanium liner had 116 holes concentric to the holes on the support portion for fitting over the connector rods. The titanium liner was welded to the titanium cap on the connector. The cathode compartment was lined with a 1.5 mm thick nickel liner which was made of a flat nickel sheet welded to a U shaped nickel side cover on the peripheral sides. The nickel liner also had 116 holes concentric to the holes on the support portion for fitting over the connector rods. The nickel liner was welded around each nickel cap. The anode was a 1.6 mm thick, 40 percent open, expanded titanium mesh with a diamond pattern of 0.65 mm SWD x 1.3 mm LWD . The anode was resistance welded to the titanium caps on top of connectors on the anode side. The cathode was made of nickel mesh of the same specifications as the titanium mesh. The cathode was resistance welded to nickel caps on top of connectors on the cathode side. A 13 mm diameter titanium pipe was welded to the titanium liner through a hole at the bottom left of the anode compartment for the brine inlet. Another 19 mm diameter pipe was welded to the titanium liner through a hole at the top right of the anode compartment for the brine and chlorine gas outlet. Similarly, nickel pipes were welded to the cathode compartment for a catholyte inlet and outlet. The cell was built so that the anode mesh receded about 0.4 mm below the titanium side gasket flange and the cathode mesh receded about 0.9 mm below the nickel side gasket flange. With an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene gasket of about 1.3 mm compressed thickness between the membrane and the cathode gasket flange and no gasket between the membrane and the anode gasket flange, the nominal inter electrode gap was about 2.5 mm. EXAMPLE 2 Four 4 electric current transmission elements were cast for a nominal 61 cm x 61 cm monopolar electrolyzer. All electric current transmission elements were cast of ASTM A536, GRD65 45 12 ductile iron and were identical in regard to as cast dimensions. Finished castings were inspected and found to be structurally sound and free of any surface defects. Primary dimensions included nominal 61 cm x 61 cm outside dimensions, a 2 cm thick support portion, 16 bosses each having a diameter of 2.5 cm located on each side of the support portion and directly opposing each other, a 2.5 cm wide sealing means area 6.4 cm thick around the periphery of the cell casting. Machined areas included the sealing means faces both sides parallel and the top of each boss each side machined in a single plane and parallel to the opposite side . The cathode cell incorporated 0.9 mm thick protective nickel liners on each side of the cell structure. Inlet and outlet nozzles, also constructed of nickel were prewelded to the liners prior to spot welding the liners to the cell structure. Final assembly included spot welding catalytically coated nickel electrodes to the liners at each boss location. The distance between the planes of the ends of the bosses was 5.8 cm for the monopolar cathode cell, and may be called the ECTE thickness. The overall cell thickness, from the outside of one nickel electrode component to the outside of the other nickel electrode component was 6.9 cm. Thus, the ECTE thickness was 92 percent of the total thickness. The cathode terminal cell was similar to the cathode cell with the exception that a protective nickel liner was not required on one side, as well as the lack of an accompanying nickel electrode. The anode cell incorporated 0.9 mm thick protective titanium liners on each side of the cell structure. Inlet and outlet nozzles, also constructed of titanium were prewelded to the liners prior to spot welding the liners to the cell structure. Final assembly included spot welding titanium electrodes to the liners at each boss location through an intermediate of vanadium metal. The anodes were coated with a catalytic layer of mixed oxides of ruthenium and titanium. The anode terminal cell was similar to the anode cell with the exception that a protective titanium liner was not required on one side, as well as the lack of an accompanying titanium electrode.
