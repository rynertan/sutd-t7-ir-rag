## Description
The present invention relates to a pulse generator for generating a train of pulses representing the displacement of a body, and more particularly to a pulse generator circuit employing a resolver for generating a train of pulses dependent on an angular displacement. Conventional pulse generators employing resolvers for generating a series of pulses operates by generating a sine or rectangular wave excitation voltage signal from clock pulses, with a frequency dividing counter, applying the excitation voltage signal to the primary winding of the resolver, counting, with a counter, the phase difference between the reference signal and an output generated from the secondary winding of the resolver, and issuing the output from the counter at a certain timing. Figs. 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings illustrate a prior art pulse generator circuit, in block form, and the waveforms of signals in the pulse generator circuit, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, an input signal sin ωt applied to the primary winding of a resolver and a phase modulated output signal sin ωt ϑ issued from the secondary winding of the resolver are applied to an analog converter 21 which generates a phase difference signal PH. The phase difference signal PH and reference clock pulses CP are applied to an AND gate 22 which issues an output CPH to a counter 23 for counting applied pulses. The count value from the counter 23 is latched by a latch circuit 24 which delivers parallel signals to a parallel to serial converter circuit 25 for converting the applied parallel signals to a serial succession of pulses which is issued as an output. Fig. 2 shows the waveforms of the input signal applied to the primary winding of the resolver, the output signal issued from the secondary winding of the resolver, the output from the comparator 21, and the output from the AND gate 22. More specifically, Fig. 2 illustrates at A the phase difference between the excitation signal sin t applied to the primary winding of the resolver and the phase modulated signal sin ωt ϑ issued from the secondary winding of the resolver. Fig. 2 shows at B the signal PH from the comparator 21, i.e., the rectangular wave signal dependent on the phase difference. Fig. 2 shows at C reference clock pulses occurring during high level intervals of the rectangular wave signal PH. With the conventional arrangement shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the anglular displacement ϑ is issued as an absolute anglular displacement. Therefore, if the frequency of the clock pulses is increased, then the number of output lines of the latch circuit 24 will have to be increased, resulting in a complicated circuit arrangement. Conversion from the parallel output to the serial output requires to be effected by the special processing circuit or converter circuit. Since the parallel to serial converter circuit is limited to a certain processing speed, the pulse generator circuit would be highly costly to construct if higher speed operation were to be achieved. French patent specification FR A 2,081,874 discloses a phase signal responsive system which comprises a driven body 818, a transducer 816 coupled to the driven body for converting a mechanical motion thereof to a phase modulated signal, an excitation signal generating means 814 for supplying an excitation signal to said transducer, a clock pulse generator means 21 for generating a train of clock pulses 21A, wave shaping means 820 for shaping the wave form of the phase modulated signal issued from the transducer, counter means 830 for receiving said clock pulses to form a content of count representing a time interval, and count pulse generator means 828 for generating count pulses. United States patent specification US A 3,508,246 discloses a position encoder for a generating digital signals as a function of angular or linear position. In this encoder a periodically varying signal, modulated as a function of input position, is applied to a zero crossing detector which produces enabling signals as a function of the phase of the input signal. Counter means responsive to the enabling signals, provides first pulses of predetermined duration as a function of alternate enabling signals, and second pulses of predetermined duration as a function of the remaining enabling signals. A motion detector, responsive to the first and second pulses, provides a first output pulse when the first and second pulses are simultaneously true, and a second output pulse when the first and second pulses are simultaneously false. It is a general object of the present invention to provide a pulse generator circuit which is capable of converting an output signal from a resolver directly to a pulse train without requiring a special processing circuit, can be manufactured inexpensively, and can be connected directly to a device designed for use with a pulse generator, such as a numerical control device. According to the present invention, there is provided a pulse generator for generating a train of pulses representing the displacement of a driven body a transducer coupled to the driven body for converting a mechanical motion thereof to a phase modulated signal, an excitation signal generating means for supplying an excitation signal as a carrier of the phase modulated signal to the transducer, a clock pulse generator means for generating a train of reference clock pulses, a waveform shaping means for shaping the waveform of the phase modulated signal issued from the transducer, a counter means for receiving the clock pulses to form a content of count representing a time interval by which the output from the waveform shaping means being in a high or low logical state is longer or shorter than the corresponding period of the excitation signal, a count pulse generator means for generating count pulses, characterised by a gate means for allowing the count pulses to enter the counter means until the counter means having contents of count corresponding to the time interval is initialized while the output from the waveform shaping means is in its succeeding logical state, and an output gate means for allowing the count pulses counted by the counter to issue out as a serial train of pulses. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example. In the accompanying drawings Prior to describing an embodiment of the present invention, the principles of a resolver for measuring an angular displacement will first be described below. It is assumed that a reference clock pulse has a period ΔT and a frequency dividing counter for counting reference clock pulses has a frequency dividing ratio n. The speed of rotation in one cyclic period of a resolver which rotates at an angular velocity ωo is equal to the difference ΔTT between the period T of the resolver when it is at rest and the period TT thereof when it is in rotation. More specifically, the output voltage of the resover can be expressed by An embodiment of the present invention based on the foregoing principles will now be described. Fig. 3 shows in a block from a pulse generator circuit according to the present invention. The pulse generator circuit includes a clock pulse generator 31 for generating clock pulses CP1 having a frequency of 5 MHz, for example, which are frequency divided by a first frequency dividing counter 32. The first frequency dividing counter 32 applies an output signal to an excitation circuit 33 which excites the primary windings of a resolver 35. The excitation circuit 33 supplies sine wave excitation signals sin ωt and cos ωt to the primary windings 35a and 35b, respectively. The resolver 35 has a secondary winding 35c which induces and applies a phase modulated signal sin ωt ϑ containing information on the angular displacement of the rotor of the resolver to a waveform shaping circuit 36. The rotor of the resolver 35 is coupled to a driven, body 60. It is apparent that the body 60 may be rotated or driven linearly while being coupled to the rotor of the resolver. The waveform shaping circuit 36 shapes the waveform of the phase modulated signal sin ωt ϑ to generate a rectangular wave signal RE. The signal RE is applied to the T input terminal of a toggle type flip flop 38 which issues signals REA and The pulse generator circuit also includes a second frequency dividing counter 37 for frequency dividing the reference clock pulse signal CP1 to produce a signal CP2 having a frequency selected to be higher than that of the output from the first frequency dividing counter 32. However, the second frequency dividing counter 37 may be dispensed with, and the reference clock pulses CP1 may be directly fed to the gate circuit 40 as indicated by the broken line in Fig. 3. A gate circuit 40 serves to control the supply of counted input pulses to an up down counter 41. More specifically, the gate circuit 40 is supplied with the reference clock pulse signal CP1, the output CP2 from the second frequency dividing counter 37, and the Q output REA from the flip flop 38. The gate circuit 40 is also supplied with a carry signal CA1 and a borrow signal B01 from the up down counter 41, and a clear signal CL1 from a preset circuit 39. The Q and The preset circuit 39 is responsive to the signal The gate circuit 40 applies pulse signals CP3, CP4 respectively to the up and down counting terminals of the up down counter 41. Similarly, the gate circuit 44 applies pulse signals CP5, CP6 respectively to the up and down counting terminals of the up down counter 45. The gate circuits 40, 44 issue signals A, A , respectively, to an OR gate 42 which produces as an output a pulse train signal Q1A corresponding to an angular displacement ϑ at the time the resolver 35 rotates clockwise, for example. Likewise, the gate circuits 40, 44 issue signals B, B , respectively, to an OR gate 43 which produces as an output a pulse train signal Q1B corresponding to an angular displacement at the time the resolver 35 rotates counter clockwise, for example. The pulse generator circuit of Fig. 3 also includes a waveform shaping circuit 100 for shaping the waveform of the excitation signal sin ωt from the excitation circuit 33. The waveform shaping circuit 100 generates an output Ref as shown in Figs. 5 and 6 as described later on. It will readily be understood that the signal Ref is used advantageously for comparison between the waveforms in the timing charts of Figs. 5 and 6. In the circuit arrangement of Fig. 3, the frequency of the reference clock pulse signal CP1 is preferably selected to be 5 MHz, and the frequency of the output CP2 from the second frequency dividing counter 37 is selected to be 125 KHz. A numerical value 1000 is preset in the up down counter 41 in response to the load signal LD1 applied from the preset circuit 39. The numerical value 1000 corresponds to the number of reference clock pulses CP1 present in one period of the frequency divided output from the first frequency dividing counter 32. When the Q output signal REA from the flip flop 38 goes high, the preset circuit 39 applies the load signal LD1 to the up down counter 41 to preset the up down counter 41 to the numerial value 1000. The preset circuit 39 also applies the clear signal CL1 to the gate circuit 40 which in turn applies the reference clock pulses CP1 as the signal CP4 to the down counting terminal of the up down counter 41. The up down counter 41 continues to count down the applied pulses while the signal REA is in the high state. When the signal REA goes low, the gate circuit 40 stops supplying the reference clock pulses CP1 to the up down counter 41. If the count of the up down counter 41 at the time the signal REA goes low is not 0, then the gate circuit 40 supplis the output CP2 form the second frequency dividing counter 37 to either the up counting terminal or the down counting terminal of the up down counter 41 in order to eliminate the count of the up down counter 41. Whether the count of the up down counter 41 is zero or not can be determined by the gate circuit 40 based on the generation of the borrow signal BO1 or the carry signal CA1. When the carry signal CA1 or the borrow signal BO1 is generated from the up down counter 41, the gate circuit 40 stops receiving the output CP2 from the second frequency dividing counter 37. The signal A from the gate circuit 40 is generated in synchronism with the output CP2 of the second frequency dividing counter 37. The signal A corresponds to the number of pulses of the signal CP2 which are applied to the down counting terminal of the up down counter 41. The signal B corresponds to the number of pulses of the signal CP2 which are applied to the up counting terminal of the up down counter 41. The gate circuit 44 and the up down counter 45 operate in the same manner as described above in response to the Therefore, the signal A from the gate circuit 44 and the signal A from the gate circuit 40 are applied in alternate half periods to the OR gate 42 to enable the same to issue the signal Q1A. Likewise, the signals B, B are generated in response to the signal Fig. 4A shows the gate circuit 40 in greater detail. The reference clock pulse signal CP1 and the signal REA are applied to an AND gate 51 which issues an output to one input terminal of a NOR gate 52. The signal REA is also applied through an inverter 53 to an AND gate 54 which issues the signal A to the other input terminal of the NOR gate 52. The NOR gate 52 produces the signal CP4. The signal A issued from the AND gate 54 is the same as the output CP2 from the second frequency dividing counter CP2 while the signal The output signal CP3 is issued from an NAND gate 57, and is in synchronism with the output CP2 from the second frequency dividing counter 37 when the borrow signal BO1 is given, the signal The signal CP4 is rendered equal to the reference clock pulse signal CP1 by the NOR gate 52 when there is no signal A. Fig. 4B shows the logical expressions of the signals A, B, CP3, and CP4. Fig. 5 is a timing chart of the signals in the circuit arrangement of Fig. 3. For an easier understanding, the timing chart shows ten reference clock pulses CP1 in one cycle of the excitation frequency of the resolver, and the output CP2 from the second frequency dividing counter 37 is of a frequency which is half that of the reference clock pulse signal CP1. It is assumed that the resolver is at rest from a time t0 to a time t1 and rotates counterclockwise from the time t1 to a time t2 and a time t3. Up to the time t1, the signal REA applied to the gate circuit 40 remains high and the up down counter 41 counts down the clock pulses CP1. Since the up dawn counter 41 has been initially set to 9 by the load signal LD1, the signal CP4 applied to the down counting terminal of the up down counter 41 is counted down thereby in the sequence of 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 9. When the last clock pulse is applied, the up down counter 41 generates a borrow signal BO1 which enables the gate circuit CP1 to stop receiving the pulse signal CP1. From the time t1 to the time t2, the signal REA is low and hence the signal The signals are produced as shown in Fig. 6 when the resolver rotates clockwise. From the time t0 to the time t1, the resolver is kept at rest, and from the time t0 on, the resolver rotates clockwise. In Fig. 6, while the signal REA or The signal REA remains high from the time t2 to the time t3. During this interval, the up down counter 41 counts down the pulses from 8 to 2. During the next half period from the time t3 to the time t4, the clock signal CP2 is continuously applied as CP4 to the down counting terminal of the up down counter 41 which has successive counts 1, 0, 9. At the count 9, the up down counter 41 produces a borrow signal BO1 to enable the gate circuit 40 to block the signal CP2. The numbers of clock pulses of the signal CP2 applied to the down counting terminals of the up down counters 41, 45 are issued as the signals A, A , respectively, which are delivered through the OR gate 42 as the signal Q1A. With the present invention, as described above, a phase modulated signal can be converted to a serial train of pulses through a simple circuit arrangement by supplying pulses through gate circuits to the up and down counting terminals of up down counters. Since the pulse generator circuit of the invention is simple in construction, it can be manufactured inexpensively. While a resolver is illustrated by way of example as a detector or a transducer for generating a phase modulated output, other detectors for generating a phase modulated output such as an Inductosyn may be employed.
