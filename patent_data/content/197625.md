# Hypodermic injection apparatus.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a pressure operated hypodermic injection apparatus 10 which is particularly suitable for needleless operation. The apparatus includes an elongate shell 20 having an inwardly facing wall with a uniform configuration along a defined length thereof, with the shell 20 further defining a discharge aperture 26 adjacent one end thereof. It further includes a plunger 24 which is slidably disposed within the defined length of the shell 20 and which is shiftable between a ready position and a spent position, with the spent position being closer to the aperture 26 than the ready position. With the plunger 24 in its ready position, the shell 20 and plunger 24 collectively define an ampule chamber which is capable of containing a dischargeable medication. A pressurized gas cartridge 22 is mounted to the plunger 24 to shift therewith and has gas releasing means which faces away from the discharge aperture. A body 50 is further included which is sealingly and releasably joined to the other end of the shell 20 . An actuator 18 is mounted to the body 50 and is manually operable for selectively operating the gas releasing means to drive the plunger 24 from its ready toward its spent position to discharge medication from the apparatus and into the patient.
