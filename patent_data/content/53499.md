# Process for producing crystalline aluminosilicates.

## Abstract
A process for producing a crystalline aluminosilicate comprises hydrothermally reacting a starting mixture com posed of a silicon compound, an aluminum compound, an alka li metal compound, a compound capable of releasing an orga nic cation in water and water, the starting mixture comprising at least two colloids having different silicon aluminum atomic ratios, and the hydrothermal reaction optionally being carried out in the presence of a fluorine compound.
