# Analgesic and antiinflammatory 1,3 diacyl 2 oxindole compounds.

## Abstract
Certain novel 2 oxindole compounds, having an acyl sub stituent at both the 1 position and the 3 position, are inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase CO and lipoxygenase LO enzymes, and are useful as analgesic agents and antiinflammatory agents in mammalian subjects. These 1,3 diacyl 2 oxindole compounds are of particular value for acute administration for ameliorating pain in human patients recovering from surgery or trauma, and also for chronic administration to human subjects for alleviating the symptoms of chronic diseases such as rheu matoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
