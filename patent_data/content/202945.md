## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION Method and Apparatus for Recording InformationBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for recording information and, more particularly, to a recording method and apparatus used when start and end signals indicating the start and end of an information signal are added before and after the information signal, respectively.Related Background Art In a so called video floppy system, for example, a method for recording an audio signal on a magnetic sheet as a recording medium in addition to a video signal has been proposed. Fig. 1 is an illustration of a magnetic sheet on which audio and video signals are recorded together.For example, under the video floppy standards, a total of 50 tracks of a field video signal V and audio signals Al, A2 can be recorded on a magnetic sheet in the form of concentric tracks. The audio signal is compressed along the time bas e to fall in a video band, and is FM modulated to be recorded on the maqnetic sheet. A recording time per tr aC is ab6ut 10 seconds when an audio band is at 5 kHz and a timb compression ratio is 640 times, and is about 20 seconds when the audio band is at 2.5 kHz and the time compression ratio is 1,280 times In this case, the audio signal can be recorded either within a single track or over two tracks or more. An audio track is divided into four sectors, as shown in Fig, 2. For example, in a 10 sec track recording mode, 2.5 seconds of information can be recorded in a single sector. Fig. 3 shows an audio signal and an additional signal recorded within a single sector in the form of a voltage level before being FM modulated. Referring to Fig. 3, after a period tl has passed from time Tot a start ID signal indicating the start timing of the audio signal continues for a period t2, and after a blank period t3, the audio signal starts. Note that a period t4 is the overlap region with the previous sector, and is not present in the first sector corresponding to the starting portion of the audio signal. A remaining period t5 corresponds to a new audio signal, and has a variable length. For example, in the 10 sec track recording mode, the period t5 corresponds to 2.5 seconds at maximum.After a subsequent blank period t6, an end ID signal for indicating the end of the audio signal and obtaining a read timing of a data signal associated with the next audio signal continues during a period t7. After a blank period t8, the data signal associated with the audio signal continues for a period tg, and a blank period t having a variable length corresponding to the period t5 of the audio signal then appears, thus completing one sector. This format is basically the same for all sectors in which audio signals are present, so that the period t5 of the audio signal is variable, and a sum of periods t5 and t10 is constant.Therefore, positions of the end ID signal and the data signal change in accordance with the length of the audio signal. The data signal includes a track number on the magnetic sheet along which a given audio signal is recorded, a starting track number and subsequent track numbers when the audio signal is recorded over several tracks, a track number recording a video signal corresponding to the audio signal, and the compression ratio of the audio signal in the form of digital data. A combination of levels of the start and end ID signals has a certain meaning. For example, if another audio signal is present in the next sector, the start ID signal is set at HIGH level LH and the endID signal is set at LOW level LL with respect to a reference voltage level Lot as shown in Fig. 4A.If the audio signal in the corresponding sector is the last one and no audio signal follows, the start and end ID signals are both set at HIGH level LH with respect to the reference voltage level Lox as shown in Fig. 4B. If no audio signal is present in the corresponding sector, the start and endID signals are both set at LOW level LL with respect to the reference voltage level Lg, as shown in Fig, 4C. Note that the voltage levels LQ, LH, and LL correspond to modulated frequencies 0, fH, and fL where L 0 and e.g., f0 6 MHz, f 7 MHz, and fL 5 MHz after they are FM modulated. In addition, .11W level of the data signal corresponds to level Lot and WOW level thereof corresponds to level LL With the combination patterns of the start and end ID signals corresponding to the specific meanings, as shown in Fig. 4, when a maximum of only one sector of an audio signal is present or a track including such a sector is present , the signal shown in Fig. 4B is recorded in the first sector, and the signal shown in Fig. 4C is recorded in the remaining second to fourth sectors. When the audio signal ends within one track, or when the audio signal continues over several tracks, the signal shown in Fig. 4A is recorded in at least the first to third sectors of the first track. As a result, average DC levels of the signals in the base band of the former and latter cases are quite different. The above mentioned signals are FM recorded, as described above. In frequency modulation, if an input signal contains a variation in DC components, this variation appears directly as a variation in modulated frequency, thus interfering with satisfactory FM recording. For this reason, a circuit must be designed using DC coupling to reliably set an absolute DC level, thereby suppressing variation in the DC level. However, this complicates the circuit arrangement when compared with a circuit using AC coupling.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situation, and has as its object to provide a method and apparatus for recording information, wherein start and end signals indicating the start and end of an information signal are added before and after the information signal, and a new combination pattern of the start and end signals having a specific meaning can be provided to reduce a variation in average DC level of the signal. rn order to achieve the above object of the present invention, when another information signal follows an information signal between the start and end signals, the start and end signals have an inverse relationship to each other, with respect to a given reference level, and when no signal follows, they have a non inverse relationship to each other. In addition, when no information signal is present between the start and end signals, they have an inverse relationship to each other, opposite to the above inverse relationship, with respect to the reference level. With the above combination patterns of the start and end signals corresponding to the specific meanings, a variation in average DC levels of the signal when an information signal is present or is not present can be minimized.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is an illustration showing recording tracks on a magnetic sheet Fig. 2 is an illustration showing an audio track divided into sectors Fig. 3 is a chart showing a conventional format of an audio signal, ID signals, and a data signal Fig. 4 is a timing chart showing conventional combination patterns of start and end ID signals corresponding to specific meanings Fig. 5 is a timing chart showing combination patterns of start and end ID signals corresponding to specific meanings when the present invention is applied to audio signal recording described with reference toFigs. l to 3 Fig. 6 is a format showing one track of the combination pattern of the ID signals explained with reference to Fig. 5 and Fig. 7 is a block diagram of a recording apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention, which can form the signals in the format explained with reference to Fig. 5.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT An embodiment of the present invention will be described when the present invention is applied to audio signal recording described with reference toFigs. 1 to 3. Combinations of levels combination patterns of start and end ID signals corresponding to specific meanings in the present invention will first be described with reference to Fig. 5, in the same manner as for Fig. 4. Note that the same reference numerals in Fig. 5 denote the same parts as in Fig. 4. As previously described, when another audio signal is present in the next sector of a track on a magnetic recording sheet, a start ID signal is set atHIGH level Ln and an end ID signal is set at LOW levelLL with respect to a reference voltage level LO, as shown in Fig. 5 A , in the same manner as in Fig. 4 A .When the audio signal in the sector of interest is the last one and no audio signal follows, the start and end ID signals are both set at HIGH level LH with respect to the reference voltage level Lot as shown inFig. 5 B as in Fig. 4 B . When no audio signal is present in the sector of interest, the start ID signal is set at LOW level LL and the end ID signal is set at HIGH level LH with respect to the reference voltage level Lg, as shown in Fig. 5 C , which is the reverse of Fig. 5 A . When viewed in reference to the reference voltage level Lot the start and end ID signals inFig. 5 A have an inverse relationship to each other.The ID signals in Fig. 5 B have a non inverse relationship, and the ID signals in Fig. 5 C have an inverse relationship to each other, opposite to that in Fig. 5 A . The voltage levels LO, LH and LL correspond to FM modulated frequencies fO, fH and fL H L where fo fg fH and f0 6 MHz, fH 7 MHz and fL 5 MHz . When the combination patterns of the start and end ID signals corresponding to the specific meanings shown in Fig. 5, when a maximum of only one sector of an audio signal is present or a track including such a sector is present , the signal shown in Fig. 5 B is recorded in the first sector, and the signal shown in Fig. 5 C is recorded in the following second to fourth sectors, as shown in Fig. 6 A .When the audio signal ends within one track or in the first track when the audio signal continues over several tracks, the signal shown in Fig. 5 A is recorded in at least the first to third sectors, as shown in Fig. 6 B .As a result, a variation in average DC levels of the signals in the former and latter cases can be minimized. Therefore, when FM recording is performed, since a variation in modulated frequencies can be suppressed, recording can be successful when a simple circuit using AC coupling is adopted. Fig. 7 shows a recording apparatus which can form signals in the format of Fig. 5, and is suitable for recording. Referring to Fig. 7, an audio signal input to a terminal 1 is supplied to an AID converter 3 through a noise reduction circuit 2. Next, the audio signal is sampled by the AID converter 3 based on a sampling signal of a frequency fAC corresponding to a compression ratio of the audio signal, supplied from a controller 4 including a microcomputer or the like to be referred to as a microcomputer hereinafter , to be converted into a digital signal. One sample of the digital audio signal is temporarily fetched by the microcomputer 4, and is then stored at a given address of a memory 6.In this case, the microcomputer 4 stores the audio signal in a given region of the memory 6, excluding a region necessary for storing the start and end ID signals and the data signal in address order, according to the format in Fig. 3. After one sector or track of audio signal is stored in the memory 6, the microcomputer 4 stores the start and end ID signal and the data signal in accordance with input data from a data input circuit 5 at remaining addresses of the memory 6. When a recording content of memory 6 is stored in the address order, it represents a signal format like that shown in Fig. 3. After the above procedure, the microcomputer 4 reads out the recording content of the memory 6 based on a PG signal from a PG detector 14 at a constant frequency rate fvc and causes a D A converter 7 to convert the readout signal into an analog signal. In this way, the D A converter 7 outputs a compressed analog signal. In this case, if the memory 6 has a capacity corresponding to one sector, the whole content thereof can be read out in 1 240 sec, and if the capacity of the memory 6 corresponds to one track, it can be read out in 1 60 sec assuming that a magnetic sheet 16 is rotated at 3,600 rpm . The output from the D A converter 7 is FM modulated by an FM modulator 9 through an emphasis circuit 8, and is then supplied to a recording amplifier 10. The recording amplifier 10 is gated only during a recording period, under the control of the microcomputer 4. Thus, the FM signal is recorded on the magnetic sheet 16 through a magnetic recording head 11. The magnetic recording sheet 16 is rotated by a motor 12 at a constant speed under the control of the microcomputer 4. Assuming that one field of a video signal is recorded during a single rotation of the sheet 16, the rotating speed of the sheet 16 is 3,600 rpm on the basis of the NTSC method. A PG head 13 detects a PG mark not shown provided on the sheet 16.The PG detector 14 generates one pulse of PG signal per rotation of the sheet 16 based on the output from thePG head 13. The output from the PG detector 14 is supplied to the microcomputer 4, which controls a recording operation based on a recording command and the PG signal. In this case, the starting point of the first sector shown in Fig. 2 is controlled to have a given phase relationship with respect to the PG mark on the sheet 16. Positional control of the head 11 on the sheet 16 is performed by a head drive circuit 15 under the control of the microcomputer 4. Since the combination patterns of the start and end ID signals corresponding to the specific meanings are as explained in Fig. 5 and a variation in averageDC levels can be suppressed, the recording apparatus ofFig. 7 can adopt a simple circuit configuration usingAC coupling, and can nevertheless perform satisfactoryFM recording. In the above embodiment, when no audio signal follows the sector of interest, the start and end ID signals are set at HIGH level LH with respect to the reference voltage level Lot as shown in Fig. 5 B , but can be set at LOW level LL. In addition, the data signal can be assigned immediately after the start ID signal instead of being assigned after the end ID signal. With this format, when the recording signal is reproduced, the data signal can be quickly accessed e.g., on a time base expansion memory during reproduction . Therefore, audio signal reproduction can be performed without any delay. Alternatively, two memories 6 can be provided and can be assigned to odd sectors and even sectors, respectively, so that the recording signals thereof are alternately read out in units of sectors to be recorded on the sheet 16. In this case, if a memory switching timing varies slightly, the data signal can be recorded without being damaged by overwriting. A case has been exemplified wherein the present invention is applied to audio signal recording.However, the present invention is not limited to audio signal recording. According to the present invention as described above, start and end signals indicating the start and end of an information signal are added before and after the information signal, and a new combination pattern of the start and end signals having a specific meaning can reduce a variation in average DC levels of the signal. Therefore, an information recording apparatus of this type can have a simple arrangement and can prevent a variation in modulated frequencies caused by variation in average DC levels.
