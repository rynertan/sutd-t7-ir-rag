# Granular detergent compositions for improved greasy soil removal.

## Abstract
A granular detergent composition, especially for laundry use, containing a specific mixture of anionic, alkoxylated nonionic and alkoxylated cationic sufactants. The compositions are particularly effective in removing greasy and oily soils from fabrics, and they have improved physical characteristics, especially odour characteristics, when prepared by spray drying.
