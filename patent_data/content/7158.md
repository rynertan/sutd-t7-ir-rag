# Grouting method for offshore structures.

## Abstract
A method for grouting the annulus 17 between a piling 14 and a piling sleeve 16 wherein air pressure is used to expel water and foreign matter from the annulus 17 . Air pressure is then reduced in the annulus 17 that is sealed at the top 18 and has a seal 19 at the bottom capable of holding a differential pressure between water pressure at depth and atmospheric air pressure within the annulus. Grouting material is then fed to the annulus 17 between the piling 14 and the sleeve 16 and permitted to set.
