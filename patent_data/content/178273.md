# Single sided cutting insert.

## Abstract
A single sided cutting insert 10 preferably for thread chasing, the lower face 12 of which comprises three support surfaces 23 25 inclining towards the center of the lower face 12 and a recess 26 separating them. The support surfaces 23 25 are projecting partly around the recess 26 and therefore the cutting insert 10 at insertion against a base surface 27 of a cutting insert site in a tool shank 28 abuts only against the planar base surface in three separated points 29 .
