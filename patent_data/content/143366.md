# Element placement method.

## Abstract
A method for placing a plurality of different size electronic elements having predetermined interconnection requirements thereamong, on a next level electronic package having an array of element placement positions thereon obtains its efficiency by determining optimum placement in a three pass process. In the first pass 19 23 , all of the elements are treated as if they are the same size defined as unit size , and the unit size ele ments are assigned to element positions on a unit size next lev el package according to the predetermined interconnection requirements thereamong. Then, the optimally placed unit size elements are replaced by macro size elements, which bear rough approximations to the actual size of the corresponding electronic element. Corresponding macro size elements are placed on a macro size next level package in element positions corresponding to the optimized placement of the correspond ing unit size elements on the unit size next level package. The macro size elements are then rearranged for optimal place ment, taking their sizes and shapes into account 24 . Finally, the optimally placed macro size elements are replaced by ac tual size elements and are placed on an actual size next level package in element positions corresponding to the optimized placement of the corresponding macro size elements on the macro size next level package. The actual size elements are then rearranged for optimal placement, taking their actual sizes and shapes into account 26 . By optimizing element placement in a three pass unit, macro and actual size process, efficiency is obtained because the element placement program need not take all the dimen sional characteristics of the elements into account at once.
