# MULTIPLE STAGE MULTIPLE FILTER HYDRATE STORE

## Abstract
An improved hydrate store for a metal halogen battery system is disclosed which employs a multiple stage, multi ple filter means for separating the halogen hydrate from the liquid used in forming the hydrate. The filter means is con structed in the form of three separate sections which com bine to substantially cover the interior surface of the store container. Exit conduit means is provided in association with the filter means for transmitting liquid passing through the filter means to a hydrate former subsystem. The hydrate former subsystem combines the halogen gas generated during the charging of the battery system with the liquid to form the hydrate in association with the store. Relief valve means is interposed in the exit conduit means for control ling the operation of the separate sections of the filter means, such that the liquid flow through the exit conduit means from each of the separate sections is controlled in a predetermined sequence. The three separate sections of the filter means operate in three discrete stages to provide a substantially uniform liquid flor to the hydrate former sub system during the charging of the battery system. The sepa ration of the liquid from the hydrate causes an increase in the density of the hydrate by concentrating the hydrate along the filter means.
