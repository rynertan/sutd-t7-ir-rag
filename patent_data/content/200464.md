## Description
A TUMOR ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN The present invention relates to the characterization of antigens1 particularly tumor associated antigens. In another aspect, it relates to antibodies having specific reactivity with such antigens. In yet another aspect, it relates to methods for producing such antibodies as well as diagnostic and therapeutic uses therefor. The potential role of monoclonal antibodies in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer has been the focus of much recent investigation and speculation. Of particular interest are their use in immunoassays to monitor the course of disease, e.g., during therapy. Also of particular interest are the potential applications of monoclonal antibodies for tumor imaging and therapy due to their capacity to bind to tumor associated antigens in vivo. Developments in monoclonal antibody technology have also made it possible to investigate the antigenic complexity of human tumors. Specifically, the precise immunoreactivity of monoclonal antibodies permits the identification and differentiation of distinct cell surface antigens expressed by human tumors. The characterization, therefore, of such distinct tumor associated antigens provides a means to more fully exploit the use of monoclonal antibodies for cancer diagnosis and therapy and to maximize the advances of monoclonal antibody technology. To date, only a limited number of tumor associated antigens are well characterized. Additionally, certain tumor associated antigens useful as diagnostic or prognostic markers may not be present in all patients or during all stages and manifestations of the disease. Accordingly, there exists a need for further identification and characterization of unique tumor associated antigens. The present invention is predicated upon the discovery and characterization of a novel antigen present in human tissue and cancerous human cell lines, particularly human colon carcinoma and colon carcinoma cell lines. Accordingly, the invention is directed to a distinct tumor associated antigen, characterized by its reactivity with monoclonal antibody CCK061. In accordance with the present invention, antibodies having specificity for the antigen defined herein and methods for the production of such antibodies are provided.Additionally, the invention is directed to the use of such antibodies for the in vitro detection and diagnosis of cancer by immunohistochemical and immunoassay methods. The invention is further directed to the use of such antibodies for the in vivo diagnosis and treatment of cancer in humans. As indicated above, the present invention provides a novel tumor associated antigen In accordance with the invention, monoclonal antibody CCK061, generated by hybrid cell line ATCC Deposit the8786, is utilized for the characterization of this previously undescribed antigen. The physiochemical and immunological properties of the antigen of the present invention, and particularly, its reactivity with monoclonal antibody ccKO6l, permit its characterization and differentiation from other antigens present in cancerous human cell lines and human tissue, including human tumor tissue. Accordingly, the identifying characteristics and properties of the antigen provided by the present invention are as follows a The antigen is present in human colon carcinoma cell lines.Standard enzyme linked immunoabsorbent binding assay procedures ELISA using monoclonal antibody CCK061 indicate the presence of the antigen in colon carcinoma cell lines but not in such other cell lines as breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, adenocarc inoma of lung, and melanoma cell lines.b The antigen is produced in the cytosol of normal colon tissue and colon carcinoma. Reactivity of CCK061 with plasma membranes purified from human colon tissue and human colon carcinoma is shown by conventional ELISA techniques. By comparison, CCK061 exhibits no reactivity with membranes puri fied from other normal or tumor tissues, including breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, adenocar cinoma of lung and melanoma.c Standard immunohistochemical procedures demonstrate the presence of the antigen in normal colon, colon carcinoma, esophogeal carcinoma and gastric carci noma as a strong reactivity with CCK061 is shown by immunoperoxidase staining of such tissue. A weak reactivity or no reactivity is shown with breast carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of lung, prostate carci noma and melanoma.d SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis reveal that the an tigen has a molecular weight in the range of about 820,000 to about 960,000. Modification of the an tigen by treatment with proteinase K prior to SDS PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis destroys the antigens reactivity with CCK061, indicating the antigen is a protein.e The antigen is glycoprotein in nature. Metabolic labeling of colon carcinoma cells with c14 glucosamine and immunoprecipitation of the antigen with Cur061 by standard procedures demonstrate that the antigen contains a carbohydrate component.f Isoelectric focusing of the antigen in solution indicates isoelectric points within the ranges of about 4.5 to about 5.0 and about 5.1 to about 5.9, and peaks at about 4.9 and about 5.4. Summarizing the foregoing, the antigen of the present invention, which may be derived from a source selected from human tissue or a cancerous human cell line, is characterized as a glycoprotein having a molecular weight within the range of about 820,000 to about 960,000 and having isoelectric points within the ranges of about 4.5 to about 5.0 and about 5.1 to about 5.9. More specifically, the antigen is characterized as having isoelectric points at about 4.9 and about 5.4. Further, the tumor associated glycoprotein of the present invention is expressed by normal colon and colon carcinoma and is present in human colon carcinoma cell lines. Of particular importance in distinguishing the antigen of the present invention from other antigens, including other tumor associated antigens, is the specificity of monoclonal antibody CCK061 for at least one determinant of the antigen characterized herein. Additionally, the specific reactivity of CCK061 for the antigen defined by the invention provides a means for isolation and purification of the antigen from other material of human origin, and ultimately, characterization of antigenic determinants. Such a purified antigen and determinants thereof are useful in the production of mono clonal and polyclonal antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic application using techniques well known in the art.For example, murine hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies may be obtained. In other cases, the antigen may be used to stimulate an immune response in a rabbit, goat or other animal from whose serum polyclonal antibodies may be obtained. In addition, the antigen may be used for the characterization of antibodies of interest, e.g., monoclonal antibodies or antibodies present in human tissue, blood or other body fluids. In accordance with the present invention, monoclonal antibodies having specificity for the antigen characterized herein, and methods for their production, are provided.Preferably, such monoclonal antibodies are of the IgG class and possess an immunoreactivity with the tumor associated glycoprotein of the present invention substantially similar to that of monoclonal antibody COCK061. Such monoclonal antibodies are useful in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer in humans, particularly colorectal carcinoma. Further, such antibodies have application in the further isolation and purification of the antigen provided by the invention and the characterization of precise determinants. Monoclonal antibodies as described above may be produced generally following the method of Kohler and Milstein Nature 256, 495 497 1975 . In accordance with the present invention, a mouse or other suitable host is immunized with the purified antigen of the invention or the soluble fraction of human tumor tissue derived from a colon carcinoma. Following immunization, the spleen cells of the immunized mouse are fused with the cells from a suitable.mouse myeloma line to obtain a mixture of hybrid cell lines.The hybrid cell lines are cultured in a suitable medium and, thereafter, those hybrid cell lines producing an antibody having specific reactivity with the antigen characterized herein are selected and cloned, and the antibody produced is recovered. The present invention suggests methods for the in vitro detection and diagnosis of cancer in humans, especially colorectal carcinoma. Characterization of the unique tumorassociated glyprotein of the invention as set forth herein permits its detection in patient tissue samples by irtgnuno histochemical methods and or in patient fluid samples by in vitro immunoassay methods. A determination of the presence and or quantity of the tumor associated antigen of the present invention in patient specimens by immunohistochemical and or immunoassay procedures is of diagnostic utility and may be indicative of or correlate with the progression of a disease state. Immunohistochemical methods for the detection of antigens in patient tissue specimens are well known to the art and need not be described in detail. Briefly, in the context of the present invention, a tissue specimen obtained from a suspected cancer patient is contacted with an antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody, having specificity for the tumor associated glycoprotein characterized herein. Particularly preferred for use is monoclonal antibody CCK061. The sites at which the antibody is bound is thereafter determined by selective staining of the tissue specimen by standard immunohistochemical procedures. Similarly, methods for the in vitro detection of antigenic substances in patient fluid samples by immunoassay procedures are well known to the art and require no repetition.For purposes of the present invention, a patient fluid sample is contacted with at least one antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody, havitl. specific reactivity with the tumorassociated glycoprotein of the invention and the antibody bound to sample components is determined. Oualitative and or quantitative determinations of the presence of the antigen defined by the invent ion may be accomplished by competitive or non competitive immunoassay procedures. Monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies may be suitably utilized provided such antibodies possess the requisite specificity for the antigen provided by the present invention. Preferably, monoclonal antibody CCK061 is utilized.Additionally, the immunoassays preferred for use are two site immunometric assays employing monoclonal antibodies which are selected to bind to non interfering determinants of the antigen characterized herein. The present invention further suggests methods for the in vivo diagnosis and therapy of cancer in humans, particularly colorectal carcinoma. Methods for tumor localization and detection may be performed, in accordance with the present invention, by administering to a suspected cancer patient a predetermined effective amount of an antibody having specific reactivity with the tumor associated glycoprotein of the present invention and detecting the sites of localization of the antibody by standard imaging techniques.The antibody, preferably CCK061, is administered to the patient in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and labeled, preferably with a radionuclide emitting gamma radiation, so as to permit detection. In accordance with methods permitted by the present invention for cancer therapy, a predetermined effective amount of an antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody, having specificity for the tumor associated antigen characterized by the invention is administered to a cancer patient. The antibody, preferably COCK061, is administered to the cancer patient in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and conj gated with a suitable therapeutic agent, e.g., radioisotopes, preferably emitters of beta particles, drugs, toxins or biological proteins, selected for delivery to the tumor site. Additionally, in the context of in vivo cancer diagnosis and therapy, those skilled in the art will appreciate that antibody preparations comprising mixtures of antibodies or fragments thereof having specificity for the tumor associated antigen of the invention may be used in certain instances to enhance the detection, localization and treatment of tumors Further in accordance with the present invention, we have unexpectedly discovered that at least one determinant of the antigen characterized herein is expressed by mucin antigens associated with the genetic disease of cystic ibrosis. More specifically, we have found that monoclonal antibody CCK061 is useful for the detection of elevated serum levels of mucin antigens indicative of cystic fibrosis. CcKO6l is particularly useful for the detection of cystic fibrosis in patients genetically unable to produce detectable quantities of sialosylated Lea antigens associated with the disease as CCK061 is reactive with mucin antigens unrelated to the Lewis blood group system. Accordingly, the present invention suggests a method for the detection of cystic fibrosis by contacting a serum sample with monoclonal antibody CCK061 and determining the binding of CCK061 to sample components by means of an immunoassay in which a second antibody, capable of binding with mucin antigens associated with cystic fibrosis, is employed. Preferably, the immunoassay is a two site immunometric assay and the second antibody is a monoclonal antibody selected such that CCK061 and the second antibody bind to non interfering determinants of serum mucin antigens associated with cystic fibrosis. The present invention may be better understood by reference to the following non limiting example. EXAMPLE I Production of Monoclonal Antibody CCK061 To produce hybrid cell line ATCC Deposit HB 8786 generating monoclonal antibody CCK061, female BalbXc mice Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA were immunized intraperitoneally with 200 of tumor cytosol obtained from an autopsy specimen of colon carcinoma 5 times at 14 day intervals. 3 days after the 5th immunization spleens were removed from the mice and a single cell suspension was prepared. Cell fusion was carried out according to the procedure of Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256, 495 497 1975 . 1 x 108 splenocytes were fused in 1.0 ml of a fusion medium comprised of 35 polyethylene glycol PEG 1500 in AP MEM medium Flow Laboratories, Inglewood, California with 2.5 x 107 P3.653 myeloma cells. Following fusion, cells were cultured in HAT medium hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine at 37C in a humidified 5 CO2 incubator. Antibodies produced by hybridomas were screened by an enzyme linked immunoabsorbent binding assay ELISA on cytosol preparations of the immunizing colon carcinoma vs.normal lung. Antibodies demonstrating a 5 fold or greater reactivity with the tumor cytosol were selected. The monoclonal antibody designated as COCK061 was characterized further and selected for use in the antigen characterization as provided herein. EXAMPLE II Antigen Characterization Monoclonal antibody CCK061 was used to characterize the antigen of the present invention by the procedures set forth herein. The cell lines utilized for antigen characterization, as well as for screening the reactivity of monoclonal antibody CCK061, were as follows Cell Line Source So403 AND SW620 Colon Carcinoma American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland.T84 Colon Carcinoma Dr. E. Masui, University of California at San Diego Cancer Center, San Diego, California.SKMel Melanoma American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland.Calu 3 Adenocarcinoma of Lung American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland.T47D Breast Carcinoma Dr. Renato Dulbecco, Salk Institute, La Jolla, California.M14 Melanoma Dr. Ralph Reisfeld, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, California.H 907 Bladder Carcinoma Dr. K.E. Bellstrom, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.PC 3 Prostate Carcinoma Dr. Mark Glassey, Univer sity of California at San Diego, La Jolla, Califor nia. Cells were grown in Autopaw media with 8 horse serum and 2 fetal calf serum in a humidified 37 CO2 incubator.Cell Line ELISA The presence of antigen reactive with monoclonal antibody CCK061 in human carcinoma cell lines was determined by an enzyme linked immunoabsorbent binding assay ELISA as measured by absorbance at 490 nm. Cells obtained from the cell lines described above were maintained in tissue culture flasks until approximately 90 confluent. The flasks containing cells and media were frozen at 200. Flasks were then brought to room temperature and cells removed and counted. Cells were adjusted to 4 x 106 cells and plated out at 2 x 105 cells per well on to a Cleveland glassfiber filter microtiter plate. Cells were washed 3 times with 0.38 gelatin, 1 bovine serum albumen in phosphate bufferred saline. Fifty 1 of monoclonal antibody CCK061 was applied per well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.After 5 washes of .3 gelatin phosphate buffered saline, 50 1 of a 1 4000 dilution of peroxidase conjugated goat anti mouse IgG and IgM was added and incubated for 1 hour. After 6 washes, 20oil of 1 mg ml o phenylenediamine, .03 H2O2 in .1M citrate phosphate buffer was added and incubated with shaking in the dark for 30 minutes. The reaction was quenched with 4N H2S04 and read at O.D. 490nm. As shown by Table I below, CCK061 was reactive with colon carcinoma cell lines SW403 and T84, indicating the presence of the antigen of the invention in human colon carcinoma cell lines. By comparison, CCK061 demonstrated no appreciable reactivity with cell lines such as breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of lung and melanoma cell lines.Membrane Cytosol ELISA The presence of antigen reactive with monoclonal antibody CCK061 in purified membrane fractions of normal human tissue and human tumor tissue was determined by an enzyme linked immunoabsorbent binding assay ELISA as measured by absorbance at 490 nm. Membrane cytosol fractions were prepared from surgical and autopsy specimens of human tissue collected within ten hours after death and stored at 800C. The tissue was homogenized in 4 volumes of l0mM tris HCl pH 7.5, 2mM calcium chloride, 2mM phenylmethylsulfonate homogenization buffer at 4 in a dounce homogenizer and all subsequent steps were carried out at 40C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000xg for 5 minutes to remove nuclei and intact cells. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 130,000 x g for one hour. The supernatant from this high speed centrifugation was removed and designated as the cytosol fraction.The pellet is resuspended in one volume of homogenization buffer and layered on a 40 20 discontinuous sucrose gradient in 10mM tris HCl pH 7.2. The gradient was centrifuged at 130,000xg for 17 hours. Material at the 40 20 interphase was pipetted off, diluted 5 fold in homogenization buffer and centrifuged for 60 minutes at 25,000 x g. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer, aliquoted and stored at 800C. To perform the membrane cytosol ELISA, the membrane and cytosol fractions were dried onto 96 well flat bottom polyvinyl microtiter plates Dynatech, Alexandria, VA at 1 pg and 10 tug of protein per well, respectively. Plates were washed four times with distilled water and then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with 20 horse serum in phosphate bufferred saline. The buffer was removed and primary antibody applied for one hour. Plates were washed 6 times with tap water prior to the addition of peroxidase conjugated goat anti mouse IgG and IgM 1 1000 dilution . Plates were incubated for one hour and then washed 5 times with distilled water. Color was developed after the addition of 100 1 of lmg ml o phenylenediamine, 0.03 hydrogen peroxide in 0.1M citrate phosphate buffer pH 5.0. Plates were incubated in the dark with shaking for 30 minutes. Wells were quenched by the addition of 50 1 per well of 4NH2S04 and read at 490nm. As shown by Table II below, CCK061 was reactive with membrane fractions of normal colon and colon carcinoma but unreactive with membranes of other normal tissues and carcinomas, including breast carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of lung, melanoma, and prostate carcinoma. Accordingly, the antigen characterized by CCK061 was demonstrated to be present only in membranes of colon carcinoma and normal colon. Iturnunohistochernical Determination The presence of antigen reactive with CCK06l in normal human tissue and human tumor tissue was determined by immunoperoxidase staining of human tissue. Sections of frozen tissue blocks, obtained from surgical and autopsy specimens collected within ten hours after death and stored at 800C were cut 4 6 microns on a microtome cryostat. The sections, mounted on glass slides, were briefly air dried and then dipped in acetone. An indirect immunoperoxidase assay, essentially as described byTaylor, Arch.. Pathol. Lab. Med. 102, 113 1978 , was used to stain these slides. Sections were dehydrated by incubating in phosphate bufferred saline PBS for 5 minutes. CCK061 antibody was overlayed onto the the sections and incubated in a humid chamber for one hour. Antibody was washed off the sections with PBS and the sections were then immersed in PBS for 5 minutes.The sections were overlayed with a 1 50 dilution of peroxidase conjugated goat anti mouse IgG and IgM antibody Tago Chemicals, Burlingame, CA and incubated for 30 minutes in a humid chamber. Antibody was washed off withPBS. The color reaction was developed with lmg ml of diaminobenzidine and 0.03 H202. Slides were counter stained with hematoxylin eosin. Table III below indicates that CCK061 had a strong reactivity with normal colon mucosa, as measured by the intensity of the staining of tissue, and a weak or no reactivity with other normal tissues. CCK061 demonstrated a weak reactivity with normal breast, lung, and prostate. Table IV below indicates a strong reactivity of CCK061 with colon carcinoma, esophogeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma and a weak, or no reactivity, with other carcinomas. A weak reactivity was shown with carcinomassuch as breast carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of lung.Biochemical Analysis of Antigen The protein nature and molecular weight of the antigen characterized by CCK061 were determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis. 20 g of cytosol prepared as described above were dissolved in gel sample buffer 62.5mM tris HCL pH 6.8, 3 SDS, 10 glycerol, .001 bromophenol blue, 5 mercaptoethanol and separated by discontinuous SDS PAGE as described by V. K. Laemmli et al, Nature 227, 680 1970 on a 3 15 linear gradient gel with a 3 stacking gel. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose 0.1 m Schleicher and Schuell at 259maps overnight according to the method of H. Towbin et al PNAS 76, 4350 1979 .The nitrocellulose replicas were incubated with 3 bovine serum albumin BSA in phosphate bufferred saline for 30 minutes and then incubated with hybridoma supernatant diluted 1 1000 with 3 BSA PBS overnight. The nitrocellulose strips were washed with 0.18 tween in PBS for 30 minutes with 5 changes of buffer and incubated with 100,000 cpm ml 125I labelled sheep anti mouse imnunoglobulin for 3 hours.After washing with PBS tween, the nitrocellulose strips were air dried and exposed on x ray film Kodak XAR 5 for 4 72 hours with intensifying screen at 700C. To further determine the nature of the antigen, membranes prepared as described above were subjected to the following treatments prior to SDS PAGE and western immunoblot analysis a Sodium Periodate 20yg of cytosol protein was incubated in 50mM sodium periodate for one hour at 40. b Neuraminidase 2Opg of cytosol was adjusted to pH 5 6 with acetic acid and incubated for 1 hour at 370C with lOmU of clostridium perfringens neuraminidase. c Proteinase K 20 g of cytosol was incubated in 2sOmg ml proteinase K for 1 hour at 370C. d Mild Alkali treatments 20 of cytosol was incubated overnight in 0.1N NaOH and then neutralized with .1N HCl. All reactions were stopped by adding gel sample buffer. By SDS PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis the molecular weight of the antigen was determined to be within the range of about 820,000 to about 960,000. Chemical and enzyme modification of the antigen followed by SDS PAGE andWestern immunoblot analysis demonstrated the protein nature of the antigen. Specifically, reactivity of the antigen with CCR061 was shown to be destructible by treatment of the antigen with proteinase K as described above. The loss of reactivity of the antigen with CCR061 did not result from the alternative modifications described above.Determination of Glycoprotein Nature The antigen characterized herein was determined to be glycoprotein in nature by immunoprecipitation ofC14 glucosamine labelled SW403 colon carcinoma cells. SW403 cells grown in Autopow, 8 horse serum 2 fetal calf serum to confluency in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks. The media was then supplemented with 50 Ci of 14C glucosamine New England Nuclear, Boston, MA and incubated for 18 hours at 370 in a humidified incubator supplied with 5 CO2 in air. The cells were washed three times with phosphate bufferred saline PBS and then scraped from the flask in lOmls PBS. The cell pellet was washed an additional three times with PBS before being resuspended in 1.0ml lysis buffer .02M tris HCl pH 8.0, lmM EDTA, 0.5 NP 40, 0.5 deoxycholate, 0.5mM phenylmethylsulfonate . After incubation on a rotator at 4 for 1 1 2 hours, the lysate was centrifuged in a microfuge 16,000xg for 1 minute and the supernatant dialyzed against TBS .02M tris HCl pH 8, ,15M Nail, 0.1t sodium azide . The 14C labelled lysate was incubated overnight with the CCKO6l antibody at 4 on a rotator. Sepharose bound sheep anti mouse immunoglobulin was added to the mixture and incubated 3 hours at room temperature.The sepharose bound material was washed 4 times with .05M tris, .15M Nail, 0.5 NP 40, .05t deoxycholate, .18 NaN3, lmg ml BSA pH 8.1 and another 4 times with the same buffer minus the BSA. Samples were analyzed bySDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as previously described.Isoelectric Focusing Isoelectric focusing of the antigen characterized by CCK061 was determined using an isoelectric focusing column as described. 20 mg of colon carcinoma cytosol prepared as described above were focused in a water jacketed ll0ml isoelectric focusing column in a 0 47 sucrose gradient containing ampholytes of the pH range 3.5 10. The column was prefocused at 600 volts for 12 hours at 4 . The sample was injected into the middle of the gradient and focused an additional 30 hours at 4 . 1 ml fractions were collected from the column and the pH was immediately determined.Fractions were dialyzed against 10oM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 overnight. Aliquots were examined for reactivity with the CCK061 antibody in an ELISA assay on colon carcinoma cytosol. Isoelectric focusing of the antigen by this technique revealed isoelectric points within the ranges of about 4.5 to about 5.0 and about 5.1 to about 5.9, with peaks of about 4.9 and about 5.4.
