# Alarm data concentration and gathering system.

## Abstract
A system is disclosed enabling bidirectional communica tions between a central station 10 and a plurality of satellite stations 12, 14, 16, 18 over a switched data transmission net work in which each satellite station initiates all communica tions between that satellite station and the central station such that prioriry data generated within a given satellite station is im mediately transmitted to the central station, while routine data generated within each satellite station is stored for delayed transmission to the central station at different times previously set by the central station but monitored by local clocks 52 within each of the satellite stations.
