# Toning apparatus and method.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for making copies of an origi nal pattern through the use of electrostatic techniques in which there is a looped belt 12 having an exterior photocon ductive layer 15 . The exterior of the belt 15 passes through a charging station 24 and is imaged by a projected pattern of light thereafter in darkness to acquire a latent image progres sively as the belt 12 moves in one direction. The belt 12 passes a toning station 28 where a toning roller 36 dipping into a sump of toner 32 picks up toner particulate matter and rolls the toner matter onto the latent image to develop the same as the belt 12 passes through the toning station 28 . The toning roller 36 engages the belt 12 and protrudes into the loop formed by the belt 12 thereby requiring the belt 12 to be wrapped around a peripheral segment of the toning roller 36 . There is a stretched portion of the belt 12 extend ing between the peripheral segment and each of a pair of guide rollers 16, 18 so that the toning roller 36 is restrained only by the tension of the belt 12 .

## Description
This invention is directed to toning development of electrostatic image wherein the electrophotographie belt is guided around the peripheral segment of the toning roller which it engages by means of pressure being applied through the belt by guide rollers, the guide rollers are sufficiently spaced from the toning roller so that there is a freely stretched and unsupported portion of the belt on opposite sides of toning roller. Thus, the toning roller is restrained by the belt alone thereby enabling accurate control of belt tension. The toner carried by the toning roller into the nip formed between the toning roller and the converging exterior surface of the belt is a more or less wedge shaped mass that starts to tone the latent image before it is compressed as it passes over the peripheral segment of the toning roller which is closely engaged by the belt.This is believed to give a better effect enabling greater densities of toning to be achieved.An important advantage of the arrangement is that any departure from parallelism between the shafts of the toning roller and the guide rollers or between the outer surfaces of the rollers is compensated for by the flexibility of the belt. This is because there is a free, unsupported section of the belt on opposite sides of the toning roller. Even flexing of the rollers bec√†ume they are supported at their ends and subjected to tension of the belt is to some extent compensated for. Another advantage of the present arrangement is that the locations and dimensions of the guide rollers are not critical relative to the toning roller and the toning station thereby enabling simple and more convenient configurations of the belt and its guiding and driving rollers. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view of a por tion of an electrophotgraphic apparatus which is constructed in accordance with the invention, this being, for example, a copier apparatus Figure 2 is an enlarged sectional view taken generally through the crown of the toning rol ler where it engages the belt Figure 3 is a diagrammatic view of a portion of an electrophotgraphic apparatus which is a modi fied fOtm of the invention and Figure 4 is a fragmentary sectional view through the surface of a modified foxm of the toning roller of the invention.The basic structure with which the invention is concerned is one in which the end result is to obtain an image of an original pattern on some form of carrier medium through the use of electrostatic techniques. In this structure the image is first obtained on the photoconductive surface of a belt and then transferred to the carrier medium. The belt is one which passes through various stations where it is charged, toned and imaged and hence is continuously circulated in the apparatus in darkness. The pattern which it is desired to reproduce may be one which is to require the belt to circulate in its loop once or a few times, as in the case of convenience copiers or it may be one of many that the apparatus is to reproduce seriatim from a store, thus requiring that the belt circulate a large number of times.This could be in a type of apparatus where a large nuer of photographs or patterns are to be reproduced. Perhaps the patterns are stored digitally and there is a conversion process which occurs between the store and the belt. The improvements made herein are cencerned primarily with the disposition of the toning roller spaced from the guide rollers of the belt so that the guide rollersuspaced from the guide rollers of the belt so that the guide rollers have little effect upon the belt tension and do not define the location of the toning roller in its jog or bow.Figure 1 illustrates diagrammatically a portion of an electrophotographic apparatus 10 which could be a convenience copier, for example. The belt 12 has a substrate 14 which provides the principal support or strength of the belt and may the sheet metal of a flexible type or some form of synthetic resin such as polyster. The outer surface 15 of the belt is a photoconductor, such as for example that which is disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,025,339. This latter material comprises a crystalline form of cadmium sul fide that is sputter deposited on the substrate 14. The thickness of the photoconductive layer 15 is preferable between one and two microns for the prupose of the invention. If the substrate is metal the deposit is directly onto the metal if the substrate is plastic there is an intervening ohmic layer that is grounded to the framework of the apparatus 10.The belt 12 is in the form of a circulation loop that is driven and guided by various guide rollers such as those which are iIIBt r sEd at 16 and 18, suitably journalled to the framework of the apparatus 10 by way of axles and bear ings such as shown respectively at 20 and 22. In the apparatus 10, there is a charging station 24 that is located to be effective before the belt reaches the imaging station 26 where the latent image is applied to the belt 12. Then the belt passes around the guide roller 16 and through the toning station 20 where it is toned and the latent image developed. Finally the toned image passes around the guide roller 18 to a transfer station 30 where the image is transferred to a carrier medium and the belt continues to move around the same loop the perform the process over again.At the toning station 28 there is a sump 32 containing a body of toner 34 which comprises particulate matter suspended in a suitable liquid. The liquid is an insulating material, an example of which is known as Isopar, a trademark of the Exxon Corporation. A toning roller 36 is journal led for rotation with its lower segment partially immersed in the body of toner 34 so that as it rotates it will carry the particulate material up the surface 38 to the nip 40 where the toning roller engages the outer surface of the belt 12. The journal of the toning roller 36 is symbolically indicated at 42. It will normally be mounted to the sump 32 so that the roller 37 may be pressed upward in the view, that is, against the loop of the belt 12 so as to form the bow or jog illustrated at 44. If there was no bow the belt 12 would extend in a flat plane between the rollers 16 and 18.The toning roller 36 is shown biased upward by means of a strong spring illustrated symbolically at 46, pressing from the framework 48 of the apparatus 10. The roller 36 may be of metal such as aluminum and its outer surface 38 is insulative, as for example, by means of anodizing.Otherwise an outer insulating sheath may be used. The axes of the rollers 16, 18 and 36 are preferably parallel one another and the surfaces of these rollers are preferably right cylindrical, but this does not always occur. To compensate for this the shafts or journals 20 and 22 are substantially spaced apart and the toning roller 36 is located between. The roller 36 is pressed past the plane defined by the bottoms of roller 16 and 18 into loop of the belt 10 and thereby produces the bow or jog 44 that connects with the remainder of the belt 12 by means of straight tensed or stretched sections 50 and 52. The belt tension is thus controlled by the pressure which is exerted by the toning roller 36 against the loop of the belt 12. The particulate material from the body of toner 34 is carried along the surface 38 on the right hand side of the roller 36 as indicated at 54 in Figure 2 and enters a wedge shaped area at the nip 40 where it can commence developing the latent image. Thereafter it is compressed and carried into the space between the belt 10 and the roller 36 over the crown of the roller. Thus when the belt 12 has passed over the roller it has a uniform and compacted layer of toner as shown at 56 to be carried to the transfer station 30. Of course this layer is selectively applied because of the presence of the latent image. If desired a cleaning station may follow the jog 44 at 37 to prevent carry over of the toner in image form. Tailing or fog may be caused by toner particles remaining in the gap between the toning roller 36 and the belt 12.The layer 54 can control this by placing a bias of minus 15 to 20 volts d.c. on the toning roller 36. The field across the belt then drives the toner particles to the latent image without intervening floaters in the carrier liquid of the gap. The belt may be scavenged for loose particles by a suitable bias after the toning and by adjusting the tension of the belt 12 but without losing the developed image. Another way of eliminating tailing or fog is by driving the toning roller 36 slightly faster than the speed of the belt 12. This feeds more particles to the gap.The wedge in the nip also feeds more particles to the gap and tends to the force the gap apart thereby preventing the high shear velocities in the gap which produce the tailing and fog and which could occur where guide rollers on opposite sides of the toning roller pinch the belt between themseiles and the surface of the toning roller to produce a uniform gap along the segment of the toning roller which is engaged by the belt 12. This segment tends to be shorter in the case of the invention herein.It is sometimes advantageous to provide a roughened surface on the roller 36 which has small dots or feet formed of permanently bonded rubber or resin. These are shown at 60 in Figure 4. There should be about 500 or more per square inch of surface raised about 10 microns above the surface. The purpose is to enable more toner to be held to the roller 36 as it rotates. The benefit of the wedge arrangement which has been described at the nip 40 of the toning roller 36 is that the gradual force applied to the toner gives it time to develop the full latent image before the squeezing starts, making more efficient use and application of the toner in a selective manner. For any given degree of tension, the squeeze force is proportional to the degree of wrap.The structure herein is likely to result in reduced squeeze than structures employing greater wrap. The structure herin disclosed reduces the amount of pressure required on the bearings 20 and 22 because they do not participate in the confinement of the roller 36. The segment of the wrap of the belt 12 around the toning roller controls the toning time along with the belt velocity and the diameter of the toning roller. Toning time is preferred between .05 and .15 second with a wrap angle between 150 and 1100 around a 1.75 inch O.D toning roller 36 at belt speeds between 7 and 15 inches per second. Belt tension for good result range between about .5 and 2 pounds per inch of width of the belt 12. The belt tension controls the wetness of the image that is developed, that is, a lower tension produces a wetter image.The nature of the carrier medium to which the image is transferred must be taken into consideration. For example, rough and porous paper would require a wetter image and lower tension. In Figure 3 there is illustrated diagrammatically another embodiment of the invention. Here the apparatus 70 is intended for transferring an image to a web 72 which moves continuously through the apparatus.The appartus 70 may have several of the structures shown in Figure 3 along the web 72, each applying a different color or a different but synchronized pattern to the belt to achieve a composite image. The web 72 may be the ultimate carrier medium or may transfer the composite image to a different carrier medium. The structure of Figure 3 comprises a circulating belt 74 being driven and or guided by rollers 76, 78 and 80 in a counterclockwise direction in synchronism with the movement of the web 72. There is a sump 82 carrying a body of liquid toner 84 having particulate matter suspended therein, mounting the toning roller 86 on the bearings 88. The sump 82 is biased upward by the spring 90 engaged against the framework 92 of the apparatus 70. The rollers 76 and 78 are spaced apart a sufficient distance so that the toning roller 86 engages the loop of the belt 74 to provide the stretched sections 94 and 96.The roller 80 has a resilient surface 98 to press the belt 74 against the backup roller 100 to transfer the developed image on the belt to the underside of the wet 72. After the belt passes around the roller 80 it is cleaned at 102, charged at 104, imaged at 106 either by projection or by suitable laser beam or beams 108 and passes over the toning roller 86. The charge may be measured for any suitable purpose by an electrometer 110. Operation of the structure of Figure 3 is governed by the same principles of apparatus 10. The principal difference lies in the configuration of the belt 74.
