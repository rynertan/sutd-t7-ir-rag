## Description
Thin invention relates to liquid polyisocyanate compositiont end in particular to compositions containing diphenylmetiJa,ne diisocyanate and to the use of such compositions in the manufacture of polyurethanes. It in well known to manufacture polyurethanes, of a cellular or non cellular nature, by reacting an organic polyisocyanata with an organic polyol in the presence of additives of various kinds. Many organic polyisocyanates have been proposed for use in making polyurethanes butt since mony polyurethane manufacturing processes ivolve the rapid mixing of materials at room temperature, it is preferred to use polyisocyanates that are liquid at room temperature and that remain in thc, liquid state without significant deposition of solid materials even when stored at relatively low temperatures couch as may be encountered in winter. One oi the polyisocyanates which has been used commercially in the manufacture of polyurethanes is diphenylmethane diisocyanate which is generally available in various forms. For the manufacture of high grade polyurethane elastomers, the preferred form is substantially pure 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate which, for present purposes meann diphenylmethane diisocyanate containing at least 97oó by weight of the 4,4 isomer, any impurity being largely the ,4 isomer with traces of the 2,2 isomer. Substantially pure 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate is not a liquid at room temperature, however, having a melting point of about 400C. For use in polyurethane manufacture, therefore, it is necessary to melt this material and maintain it in a molten condition. In order to overcome this difficulty, various proposals have been made for convertIng substantially pure 4,4 diph enylmethane diisocyanate to a liquid polyisocyanate composition which remains liquid when stored at a low temperature. The present invention provides a method for the preparation of a liquid diphenylmethane diisocyanate composition which comprises reacting one molar proportion of substantially pure 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, as hereinbefcre defined, with from C.01 to 0.8 molar proportions of a monoalkoxt polyalkylene glycol of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms1 R represents hydrogen or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and n is an integer of from 2 to 58, the reaction being performed at a temperature of from 100 to 2500C and in the presence of a catalyst for the NCO OH reaction. In the monoalkoxy polyalkylene glycol, R is preferably an alkyl group containing from í to 5 carbon atoms, for example methyl or ethyl. R is preferably hydrogen or methyl, the material then being a monoalkoxy polyethylene or polypropylene glycol. The above formula includes copolymeric monoalkoxy polyalkylene glycols, for example copolymers derived from ethylene and propylene oxides.The integer n is preferably less than 44. Mixtures of monoalkoxy polyalkylene glycols may be used. Under the conditions specified for the performance of the method of the invention, the urethane formed by the reaction of monoalkoxy polyalkylene glycol with the diphenylmethane diisocyanate reacts with further isocyanate to form an allophanate. It will be appreciated, however, that the reaction product may contain a minor proportion of material that has not reacted beyond the urethane stage as wellsas higher functionality material where the reaction has gone beyond the allophanate stage. Particularly useful products are obtained when one molar proportion of the substantially pure 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate is reacted with from 0.1 to 0.3 molar proportions of the monoalkoxy polyalkylene glycol. The reaction between the diphenylmethane diisocyanate and the monoalkoxy polyalkylene glycol is preferably performed at a temperature in the range 100 to 200 G and is continued until a product of the desired constitution is obtained. The reaction catalyst may be any catalyst known for the reaction between isocyanate and hydroxyl groups. Particularly suitable catalysts are tin and dialkyl tin salts of carboxylic acids, for example stannous octoate and dibutyl tin dilaurate.Other suitable catalysts are tertiary amines in which the nitrogen atom is not directly attached to an aromatic residue, for example 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2joctane. The monoalkoxypolyalkylene glycol is conveniently added slowly to the polyisocyanate and catalyst at the reaction temperature, but the reactants may alternat vely be brought together at ambient temperature or at an intermediate temperature and then heated to the reaction temperature.After the reaction is complete, it is preferable to deactivate the catalyst either chemically, for example by incorporating an acidic substance,or physically, for example by adsorption on to activated carbon. It is also possible in some cases to remove the catalyst by filtration or distillation. The polyisocyanate compositions of the present invention are liquid compositions which are stable to storage, that is to say the compositions remain liquid at room temperature ior long periods of time, sufficient in fact for all practical purposes, and can be transported or stored at low temperature without significant sedimentation of crystals of 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate. The compositions are suitable for use in the manufacture of polyurethanes using techniques fully described in the prior art. Being substantially difunctional, the compositions are particularly suitable for the manufacture of polyurethane elastomers and flexible foams including microcellular elastomers. If desired, the choice of monoalkoxypolyalkylene glycol may be made with a view to tailoring the properties of the composition to suit a particular application. For example, in the formation of polyurethane foams from aqueous systems it may be desirable to increase the interaction between the aqueous phase and the isocyanate phase this may be achieved by employing a hydrophilic monoalkoxypolyalkylene glycol such as a monoalkoxypolyethylene glycol. If less interaction between the phases is required, a more hydrophobic material such as a monoalkoxypolypropylene glycol may be more suitable. In general we have found that the compositions of the present invention give superior polyurethane foam products, in terms of properties such as strength and ease of cure, when compared with X4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate in which no reaction with a monoalkoxy polyalkylene glycol has taken place.
