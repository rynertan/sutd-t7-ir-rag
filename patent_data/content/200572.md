# INJECTION METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A centrifugal injection machine comprises a rotor arm bearing at each of a pair of free ends a pivotably mounted container. A holder which retains a multiplicity of workpieces is insertable into a capsule or cavity within each container. The rotary arm contains a reservoir associated with each container or liquifying a charge of material. Upon rotation of the machine at a high velocity, the liquified material is transfered from the reservoir to the container in a vacuum and is pressurized therein as a result of centripetal accelera tion. Upon the termination of a predetermined interval, a trip mechanism is activated to rotate the containers so that the molten liquid which has not been injected under pressure into recesses in the workpieces is ejected or discharged from the containers. The containers rotate within a vacuum chamber which is depressurized prior to the centrifuge operation.
