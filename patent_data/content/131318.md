# Fluid flow measuring device.

## Abstract
Fluid flow measuring device comprising sensor elements positioned onto the outer wall of the thermically conducting measuring channel and thermically insulated from the envi ronment by an insulating body. The sensor elements can be heated for creating a temperature gradient as a function of the fluid flow rate, which temperature gradient can be converted into an electrical measuring signal using a bridge circuit. The bridge circuit comprises four sensor elements which two by two are connected in series and are positioned onto the fluid measuring channel such that of each series circuit one ele ment is positioned onto a fluid measuring channel such that of each series circuit one element is positioned onto a first sec tion of the fluid measuring channel upstream in relation to a second section of the fluid measuring channel onto which the other element of the respective series circuit is positioned, whereby the downstream end of each series circuit is con nected to the upstream end of the respective other series circuit, and the electrical measuring signal is available at the junctions within said series circuits. The sensor elements are formed by thin or thick film resistors or integrated semicon ductors onto the electrically insulating fluid measuring chan nel respectively onto a thin insulating layer onto the electri cally conducting fluid measuring channel.
