# POWER SUPPLY DEVICE FOR ATOMIZER USED IN ATOMIC ABSORPTIOMETER

## Abstract
A power supply device for an atomizer 9 of resistance heating type used in an atomic absorptiometer, which comprises a constant current control circuit including a current negative feedback circuit 5, 16 5, 36 for maintaining the current supplied to the atomizer 9 at a constant value corresponding to a given current setting signal, a circuit 10, 13, 14 calculating the power supplied to the atomizer 9 , and a current compensation circuit 16, 36 for regulating manually or automatically the rate of negative feedback through the negative feedback circuit or the level of the current setting signal in response to a variation of the output signal from the power calculating circuit.
