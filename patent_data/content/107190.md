# Method and apparatus for compacting shirred casing.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for compacting strands 34 of shirred casing by applying substantially equal and opposite forces simultaneously to both ends of the strand. In one em bodiment this double ended simultaneous compaction is achieved by compacting the strand about a sliding sleeve 38 and against a restraint 42 so that movement of a compaction arm 26 against only one end of the strand 34 will cause the sleeve 38 to slide with respect to the restraint 42 .
