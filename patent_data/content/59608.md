# Method and apparatus for making a patterned non woven fabric.

## Abstract
A non woven fabric having a pattern defined by an array of discrete areas having a reduced fibre density but which are substantially free of perforations is produced by support ing a freshly wet laid web of the non woven fabric on a porous surface and directing spaced jets of fluid against the unsupported side in order to displace fibres within discrete areas whilst maintaining in position a proportion of fibres that are within those areas and that are adjacent the porous surface. The fabric web may be supported on a Fourdrinier wire 1 and the jets of fluid e.g. water may be directed through the apertures in a perforated cylinder 6 , the fluid being supplied under pressure from a water knife device 11 . The apertures in the cylinder 6 preferably have a cross section that increases in the direction of the water jets. Vacuum may be applied through the Fourdrinier wire 1 by means of a vacuum box 10 and vacuum may also be applied within the cylinder 6 from means 17 in order to remove excess water from within the cylinder 6 .
