## Description
ROLL DOWN TARGET FOR PINBALL GAME MACHINE This invention relates generally to pinball game machines, and more particularly to a target device for a pinball game. Pinball game machines or pinball games have historically had a single, flat playfield or playboard on which numerous target elements are mounted. The playboard is generally disposed such that it is inclined toward the player, thereby causing the ball in play to roll toward the player. The player manipulates flippers or other similar devices in order to propel the ball back up the incline toward certain targets. Generally, whenever the ball hits a target, an electrical device is activated to increase the player s score by the number of points attributed to that particular target. In no known pinball game, however, has hitting a target been associated with loss of the ball in play. Generally, loss of the ball in play only occurs when the player fails to propel the ball back up the incline surface of the playboard. Recent advances in the pinball game art have transformed the traditional single playfield game into a multiplayfield game which can challenge the most demanding players. For example, in United States Patent ApplicationSerial No. 277,324, filed on June 25, 1981 and assigned to the assignee of the present application, a pinball machine is disclosed having a first playfield inclined toward the player and a second playfield disposed below the first and inclined away from the player. This application is hereby incorporated by reference. Such multi level pinball games, however, create the need for innovative devices for transferring the ball in play from a position on a playfield to a position below the playfield. The present invention provides such an innovative device by providing a roll down target for transferring a ball in a pinball game from a position on a playfield to a position below the playfield when the ball hits a scoring target. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a target assembly includes a target which is movably connected to the playfield and which is urged to a substantially upright position by a biasing element. As the ball in play hits the target, the target is moved relative to the playfield to pass through an opening in the playfield near the target. The ball in play which impacts the target follows the target through the opening.The ball is guided through the opening by a guide element to the position underlying the playfield. The target, being no longer subject to forces imparted to it by the ball in play, moves back to its original upright position under the urging of the biasing element. The target assembly is equipped with a suitable electrical device for incrementing the player s score when the roll down target is hit by the ball in play. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved target assembly for a pinball game. The above noted and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the preferred embodiments of the present invention which are described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like members bear like reference numerals, and wherein Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a pinball game employing a roll down target according to the invention Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of a roll down target according to the present invention in which the roll down target is illustrated in a first upright position Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of the roll down target according to the present invention in which the roll down target is illustrated in an intermediate position Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view of the roll down target according to the present invention in which the roll down target is illustrated in a second position and Fig. 5 is a cross sectional view of another embodiment of the roll down target according to the present invention. Referring now to Fig. l, a new and improved pinball game 10 includes a playfield 12 which lies in a plane sloped away from the usual player position 14 for a pinball game. Advantageously, the pinball game 10 also has a playfield 16 having a traditional slope toward the player position 14. The playfield 12 will be referred to herein as the reverse sloped playfield and the playfield 16 will be referred to as the primary playfield or the conventionally sloped playfield. The playfields 12, 16 have opposite slopes. The term opposite slope as referenced to two surfaces means that a ball rolling in a plane passing through both surfaces would roll in one direction on one surface and in the other direction on the other surface. In the preferred and illustrated embodiment, the pinball game 10 includes the conventional pinball elements.A cabinet 20 is provided for supporting the playfields 12, 16 using conventional hinges and other brackets. The upper playfield 16 is conventionally hinged hinge not shown at the end distant from the player. A set of supporting legs 22 is provided for elevating the cabinet 20 to a height convenient to the pinball player. A plunger or shooter 24, and a set of flipper control switches 26 are disposed on the cabinet 20 near the player position 14. Sets of thumper bumpers 28, flipper mechanisms 30, and other ball propelling devices such as slingshots, etc., are disposed in a conventional manner on the primary playfield 16. A conventional solenoid operated out hole not shown is provided to return the ball to the shooter 24 when this ball is lost in play between the flipper mechanisms 30 or when the ball is returned from the lower playfield 12. A back glass assembly 32 is supported at the end of the cabinet 20 opposite the player position 14. The back glass assembly 32 has the usual pinball assemblies such as scoring displays 34, a game talley display 36, andball in play display 38. A conventional pinball controller not shown is employed in pinball game 10. Preferably, it is of the microcomputer type and is programmed to control scoring and game play, according to state of the art techniques, in response to operations of the ball propelling devices.A typical pinball game controller is that used by do Gottlieb Co., Northlake, Illinois, for example, in its current pinball games. Referring now to the reverse sloped playfield 12, in the preferred and illustrated embodiment it is supported by conventional brackets not shown within the cabinet 20 to underlie the primary playfield 16. The brackets may be movably mounted to allow the operator to adjust the angle of inclination of the playfield 12. The playfield 12 is spaced from the playfield 16 and is generally located centrally under the primary playfield 16. The playfield spacing is at least the diameter of a ball and the height of the ball propelling elements on the playfield 12 to allow ball play on the lower playfield 12. The spacing between the playfields 12, 16 extends around the entire periphery of the lower reverse sloped playfield 12 so that the playfields 12, 16 are not contiguous. Disposed on the lower playfield 12 are the usual thumper bumpers not shown , flipper mechanisms 30A and other ball propelling apparatus. Operation of the ball propelling elements on the lower playfield 12 causes scoring on the displays 34 in a conventional manner. As seen from the figures, the flipper mechanisms 30, 30A are disposed to propel the ball in planes of opposite slope during play. The flipper mechanism 30A actively propels the ball toward the player position 14 after the ball has rolled downwardly away from the position 14 toward the mechanism 30. The playfield 16 is specially designed to allow viewing of the lower playfield 12. To this end, one or more window mechanisms are provided in the primary playfield 16. In the illustrated embodiment a single window mechanism 42 is shown. The window mechanism preferably is comprised of a relatively flat, generally transparent material such as a pane 44 of plexiglas. The pane 44 lies in the plane of the primary playfield 16 to minimize disturbance of the roll of the ball during play. As a matter of preference, the pane 44 may be tinted to facilitate viewing of the underlying playfield 12 and to reduce glare. The playfields 12, 16 are designed to allow them to be confined in a conventional pinball cabinet and yet provide space for one or more roll down target assemblies 40 which allow transfer of the ball from one playfield to the other. Referring now to Figs. 2 4, the roll down target assembly 40 includes a target member having a target bracket 42 and a target element 44. The target element 44 is connected to the target bracket 42, such as by a rivet 46. Other methods of connecting the target element to the target bracket may be employed, or they may be integral. The target assembly 40 also includes a pivot element 48. The target bracket 42 is movably mounted with respect to the pivot element 48 such that the target element 44 is selectively movable from a position above the playfield 16as illustrated in Fig. 2 to a position below the playfield as illustrated in Fig. 4. As shown, the preferred motion of the element 44 is pivoted however, other motions are suitable. A suitable biasing member, such as a spring 54, urges the target bracket 42 to return the element 44 to the position illustrated in Fig. 2. With continued reference to Fig. 2, during play the ball 50 illustrated with dashed lines is propelled toward the target element 44. Prior to the ball hitting the target element, the target element has been urged to the upright position illustrated in Fig. 2 by the biasing member. Once the ball hits the target element 44, however, the force imparted to the target by the ball overcomes the biasing force causing the target member to pivot about the pivot element 48. An opening 60 is provided in the playfield 16. As the target element 44 pivots about the element 48, the ball follows the target element 44 through the opening 60 included in the playfield 16. The ball is guided into the opening 60 by a guide element 62 which is fixedly connected to the playfield. The guide element 62 prevents the ball from overshooting the opening in the playfield after the target element 44 has been hit. Referring to Fig. 3, the target element continues to pivot under the influence of the ball 50 until the ball rolls over the edge of the target element, as illustrated in Fig. 4, and onto underlying structure, such as a ball track or the second playfield 12. Once the force imparted to the target element by the ball is removed, the target element is urged by the biasing member back through the opening 60 and into the position illustrated in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 4, the structure underlying the opening 60 preferably is a track 64 for transferring the ball to a given location on the underlying playfield. A pair of switch contacts 66 is positioned in the track 64 so that passage of the ball 50 through the opening 60 can be detected for scoring purposes. Referring now to Fig. 5, another embodiment of the target assembly 40 includes a hole cover 52 which covers the opening 60 when the target assembly is in the upright position. The hole cover 52 is connected to the target bracket 42 and essentially lies in the plane of the playfield 16 when the target bracket is in the position illustrated. As the target element pivots under the influence of the ball 50, the hole cover 52 moves with the target bracket 42, thereby uncovering the opening 60.Alternately, the hole cover may comprise a plurality of members not illustrated at least some of which, or all of which, are connected to the playfield 16. The members may be of the living hinge type or any other suitable type which permits passage of the target element 44 and the ball 50 through the opening 60. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 5, the ball is guided by the guide element 62 and by a second guide element 63 which extends into the region below the playfield 16. The shape of the guide element 63 is chosen to direct the ball to a desired location under the playfield 16. The target member need not be mounted on a pivot element connected to the underside of the playfield. It may be mounted in any suitable fashion which permits passage of both the target element 44 and the ball through the opening 60 in the playfield. Additionally, either or both of the guide elements 62, 63 may be omitted, or they may be an integral part of the playfield, or they may be integral with each other. Moreover, the opening 60 may be chosen sufficiently large so that the target element need not make a large angular movement in order to pass the ball to the underlying position. The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification. The invention which is intended to be protected herein, however, is not to be construed as limited to the particular forms disclosed, since these are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Moreover, variations and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention.
