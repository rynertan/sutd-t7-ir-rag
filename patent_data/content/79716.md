# Explosive tube expansion.

## Abstract
Apparatus for expanding a tube 10 within a tube sheet 12 has an insert 22 and a detonation device 26 . The insert is sized to fit coaxially within the tube. The detonation device encircles the insert and can produce upon detonation an explosive force. Also included is an annular buffer 20 sized to fit between the tube and the detonation device. In operation, the tube is inserted into a tube hole 14 of the tube sheet. The insert is coaxially positioned within the tube and within the tube hole. The insert is overlayed with an explosive layer and the buffer is interposed between the explosive layer and the tube. The tube is joined to the tube sheet by detonating the explosive layer.
