# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONSTRUCTING AN UNDERWATER FILL

## Abstract
A method of constructing an underwater fill in a manner which enables the formation of a dense fill pile having steep side slopes and having an improved capability to resist ero sion. The method comprises withdrawing water from fill de posited at an underwater construction site as fresh fill is added to the underwater fill pile. Apparatus for performing the method comprises a per forated conduit, pumping means for pumping water and a closed conduit for water communication between the perfo rated conduit and the pumping means. Operation of the pumping means withdraws water from underwater fill sur rounding the perforated conduit for passage through the conduits and discharge from the pumping means.
