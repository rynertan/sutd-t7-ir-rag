# Color video signal recording apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a color video signal recording apparatus wherein the chrominance signal and the luminance signal are separated from the composite color video signal, the lumi nance signal is transformed into a frequency modulation signal and the chrominance signal is converted to have a lower fre quency so that both reformed signals are recorded on a fre quency multiplex basis on a recording medium. In processing a TV signal of CCIR system, the chrominance signal is con trolled to have a frequency of 3 8 N f
