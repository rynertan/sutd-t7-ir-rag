# DISPLAY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A laser scanned, flat panel display system is disclosed. In one embodiment, the display system comprises a display panel 54 , a plurality of first mirrors 30 , a plurality of second mirrors 50 , a source of light 10 , means for modulating the intensity of the light 12 , and deflection means 14 . The display panel includes a display surface that extends along X and Y axes. Each first mirror is located at a different position along the X axis, and has an elongated dimension normal to the X axis. Each second mirror is located at a different position along the Y axis, and includes an elongated dimension normal to the Y axis. The deflection means directs the light as a first beam 17 to a selected first reflection point 32 on one of the first mirrors, such that the first beam is reflected from the first reflection point as a second beam 18 . The second beam strikes one of the second mirrors at a second reflection point 52 and is reflected as a third beam 19 to a display point 53 on the display surface. The first and second mirrors are positioned such that varying the location of the first reflection point along the elongated dimension of a particular first mirror causes the Y coordinate of the display point to change, and varying the location of the first reflection point from one first mirror to another first mirror causes the X coordinate of the display point to change.
