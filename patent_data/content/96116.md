## Description
New compound having mucoregulating and anticough activity, process for its production and relative pharmaceutical compositionsIt is an object of the present invention the thiophen 2 carboxylate of 2 methyl 5 1 hydroxy 1 methyl ethyl cyclohexen 2 yl, having formula I EMI1.1 The therapeutic properties of 2 methyl 5 1 hydroxy 1 methyl ethyl 2 cyclohexen 1 ol, or sobrerol II EMI1.2 are known since many years, It has been used for the treatment of respiratory diseases V.Dalla Valle Boll. Chim. Farm., 109 1970 , and more exactly as fluidifying agent with bronchosecretagogue and mucosecretolytic activi ty in cases of acute and chronic bronchitis with hypersecretive and obstructive component of the respiratory routes R. Scuri et al., 11 Farmaco ed. Pr. , 1 1980 .It has now unextectedly found that the ester of thiophen 2 carboxylic acid with sobrerol, that is compound I, possesses a bronchosecretogogue, mucosecretolytic and fluidifying activity higher than that of sobrerol and is moreover characterized by marked anti cough properties, comparable to that of codeine.Thus, another object of the invention is provided by pharmacological compositions endowed with mucoregulating and anti cough activities, containing as active principle compound I .Finally, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of the thiophen 2 carboxylate of 2 methyl 5 1 hydroxy 1 methyl ethyl cycloilexen 2 yl, characterized by reacting thiophen 2 carbo xylic acid chloride III with sobrerol II , according to the following scheme EMI2.1 The reaction is suitably carried out in aprotic solvents, for example in ethers such as dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and in presence of acidity acceptors. As such, tertiary bases are preferably used, such as pyridine or trie thylamine. One can operate at temperatures ranging from 0 and 400C, preferably at room tempera ture,The following example further illustrates without limiting it,the process according to the in invention. EXAMPLE 60 Grams of thiophen 2 carboxylic acid chloride are dissolved in 500 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran to this solution 30 ml of anhydrous pyridine and 60 g of sobrerol in its dl trans form , diluted in 500 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, are added. The mixture is allowed to react for two hours at room temperature. At the end, the solvent is evaporated under reduce pressure the residue is diluted by ethylether and the organic phase is washed first with water, then with a saturated bicarbonate solution. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, fil tered and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure.The crude product so obtained is purified on a silica gel chromatographic co lumn, elating first with petroleum ether and the with a mixture of petroleum eter ethyl e ther 1 1.73 Grams of an oil impossible to crystallize, but perfectly pure in TIiC, are obtained.The compound so obtained, of a yellowish colour, is almost insoluble in water, and soluble in the common organic solvents.Elemental analysis for C15H2003S M.W. 280.374 calcd.

Pharmac okinet i c s From the pharmacokinetics tests performed in the animal after oral administration of AFP 862 and sobrerol in equimolar doses, higher sobrerol concentrations at pulmonary level have been surprisingly noticed, as a demonstration of an higher pulmonary tropism for APP 862.Compound I is therefore fit as an elective drug with mucoregulating, mucolytic and anti cough activities, in the therapy of acute and chronic diseases of the respiratory apparatus, particularly of acute and chronic bronchitis and of cough of any nature. The present invention refers also to all the industrially applicable aspects connected with the use of AFP 862 as mucoregulating and anti cough agent. An essential aspect of the invention is therefore provided by pharmaceutical compositions containing predetermined amounts of AFP 862. Such a compound can be administered, particularly, by the oral route, as capsules, extemporary susnension, monodose sachets in a granular state , or by aerosol or as suppositories or, finally, parenteral route vials for innection . Of course, the sinFrle pharmaceutical forms will co ltain trew active principle together with veihcles, excipients, flavouring agents etc. of conventional use in pharmaceutical technique.
