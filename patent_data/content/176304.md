## Description
This invention relates to herbicidally active pyrazolesulfonamides having certain heterocycles attached, agriculturally suitable compositions thereof and the method of their use as herbicides and or plant growth regulants. In the most common situation, the control of undesired vegetation is desired to permit the growth of useful crops such as cotton, rice, corn, wheat and soybeans, to name a few. Unchecked weed growth in such useful crops can cause significant losses, reducing profit to the farmer and increasing costs to the consumer. In other situations, herbicides are desired which will control all plant growth. Examples of areas in which complete control of all vegetation is desired are areas around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots and industrial storage areas. There are many products commercially available for these purposes, but the search continues for products which are more effective, less costly and environmentally safe.

In addition EP A 95,925 teaches the synthesis of The prerequisite starting material 44 in Equations 19, 19b, 22a, 22b and 24a may be prepared in a number of ways. For example, alkylation of a protected hydrazine 63 with a substituted heterocycle 64, followed by hydrolysis leads to compounds such as 44. This reaction is outlined in Equation 26. Further details pertaining to this type of transformation may be found in Alternatively, compounds of Formula 44 may be prepared from the reaction of a suitable ketone with hydrazine as shown in Equation 27. This methodology would be particularly suited to values of Q where Q is a saturated heterocycle such as Q 25 through Q 28 or partially saturated such as Q 41 through Q 44. For a review of the Wolf Kishner reaction see Todd, The prerequisite starting material 60c in Equation 25 may be prepared in several ways. For example alkylation of pyrazole with the properly functionalized heterocycle QBr or QI would yield 60c directly, as shown in Equation 28. For further details of Pd or Cu catalyzed couplings see S. Gronowitz, and S. Lilgefors, An alternate synthesis of compounds such as 44 or 60c utilizes the heterocyclic amines such as 65. Diazotization of 65 followed by reduction affords 44 directly as shown in Equation 30a. Hydrazine 44 may then be converted to 60c via condensation with 1,1,3,3 tetraethoxypropane R₂ H . For further details see Jones, Heterocyclic hydrazines may also be prepared by nucleophilic displacement of active halogens from 66 as shown in Equation 30b. Hydrazine 44 may then be converted to 61 as illustrated in Equation 24a. Compounds such as 44 are well known in the literature and may be prepared by one skilled in the art. For examples of this general displacement reaction see P. Nelson and K. Potts, The heterocyclic amines of Formula 6 in Equation 3 can be prepared by methods known in the literature or simple modifications thereof, by those skilled in the art.

Compounds of Formula 6, where A is A 7, can be prepared by methods taught in European Patent Application No. 125,864 published November 21, 1984 . In addition, general methods for preparing aminopyrimidines and triazines have been reviewed in the following publications Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds of Formula I are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by contacting compounds of Formula I with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g., hydroxide, alkoxide or carbonate . Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct contact of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., alkali or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble, e.g., a potassium, sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I with a suitable acid, e.g., The preparation of the compounds of this invention is illustrated by the following specific examples. To a solution of 27 g of methyl 1,5 dimethyl 4 sulfonamido 3 pyrazolecarboxylate in 250 mL of ethanol at room temperature was added 29 g of hydrazine monohydrate.

The solution was heated to reflux for 19 hours and then concentrated To a solution of 1.1 g of 85 potassium hydroxide in 50 mL of methanol at room temperature was added 4.0 g of 1,5 dimethyl 3 2 mercapto 1,3,4 oxadiaz 5 yl pyrazolesulfonamide in one portion. The solution was stirred an additional 10 minutes and then 2.67 g of iodomethane was added dropwise. The solution was sitrred for 1 hour at room temperature and 1 hour at reflux. The reaction mixture was concentrated Ethyl ethoxymethylene cyanoacetate, 19.5 g, was added in one portion to a solution of 2 hydrazinopyridine, 12.5 g, in 100 mL of absolute ethanol. The reaction was then heated at reflux for 2 1 2 hours and cooled. The solid which formed was collected by filtration and washed with absolute ethanol. After air drying, the product weighed 22.6 g and melted at 92 93 C. The product from Example 4, 21.6 g, was dissolved in 100 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid at 0 C. To this resulting clear solution was added a solution of sodium nitrite, 7.3 g, in 10 mL of water at 0 C during 15 minutes. The resulting suspension was stirred an additional 30 minutes then added portionwise during 10 minutes to a solution of cuprous chloride, 9.3 g, in 100 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid. The reaction was very exothermic and accompanied by rapid nitrogen evolution. The suspension was then heated on the steambath until a test for diazonium salts was negative. The contents of the flask were cooled and the pH of the suspension adjusted to 8 with ammonium hydroxide and finally diluted with 100 mL of water. The solids were removed from the reaction by filtration through Celite and the aqueous filtrate was washed with 200 mL of methylene chloride. After separating and drying the organic solution with anhydrous sodium sulfate, 17.4 g of a light brown oil was isolated after removal of the solvent by evaporation. The crude oil was flash chromatographed on Kieselgel 60, 230 400 mesh, using 1 1 hexanes ethyl acetate as the eluent. 14.2 g of the title compound was obtained melting at 52 53 C. Sodium metal, 1.4 g, was dissolved in 50 mL of methanol. After all the metal had dissolved, the solvent was removed The mixture, 12 g, obtained from Example 6 was dissolved in 100 mL of glacial acetic acid and 1.75 mL of water. The solution was cooled to 10 C and 13.1 g of chlorine was added dropwise. The resulting suspension was allowed to stir at ambient temperature for 2 hours. The reaction was poured into ice water, and the aqueous solution washed two times with ether. The organic solution was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to afford a white solid. The solid was added portionwise to a solution of 2.2 mL of ammonia and 100 mL of THF causing an exotherm. The reaction was diluted with water until all solids dissolved.

Using the procedures of Examples 1 8, the techniques described in Equations 1 30 or simple modifications thereof, the following compounds of Tables I XXIV can be prepared by those skilled in the art. Useful formulations of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few pints to several hundred gallons per acre. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 5 to 99 solid or liquid diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by either incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents . Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. Preferably, ingredients should be approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the use intended. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning, Agglomeration , For further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example In the following examples, all parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The ingredients are blended and hammer milled to produce particles of active ingredient essentially all below 20 microns in diameter. The product is reblended before packaging. The ingredients are ground together in a sand mill until the solid particles have been reduced to under about 5 microns. The resulting suspension may be applied directly, but preferably after being extended with oils or emulsified in water. The ingredients are combined and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all below 3 microns. The product can be used directly, extended with oils, or emulsified in water. The ingredients are combined and stirred to produce a solution, which can be used for low volume applications. The ingredients are combined and stirred until the active is dissolved. A fine screen filter is included in packaging operation to insure the absence of any extraneous undissolved material in the product. The ingredients are slurried and ground together in a sand, ball or roller mill to produce particles essentially all under five microns in size. The active ingredient is blended with attapulgite and then passed through a hammermill to produce particles essentially all below 200 microns. The ground concentrate is then blended with powdered talc until homogeneous. The ingredients are blended in a rotating or fluid bed mixer and sprayed with water to accomplish granulation. When most of the material has reached the desired range of 1.0 to 0.42 mm U.S.S. 18 to 40 sieves , the granules are removed, dried, and screened. Oversize material is crushed to produce additional material in the desired range. These granules contain 75.2 active ingredient. A slurry of wettable powder containing 50 solids is sprayed on the surface of attapulgite granules in a double cone blender. The granules are dried and packaged. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled and then moistened with about 12 water. The mixture is extruded as cylinders about 3 mm diameter which are cut to produce pellets about 3 mm long. These may be used directly after drying, or the dried pellets may be crushed to pass a U.S.S. No. 20 sieve 0.84 mm openings . The granules held on a U.S.S. No. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings may be packaged for use and the fines recycled. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammermill to produce a high strength concentrate that essentially all passes through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm openings . This material may then be formulated in a variety of ways. Test results indicate that the compounds of the present invention are active herbicides. They should have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, parking lots, drive in theaters, around billboards. highway and railroad structures. Alternatively, some of the subject compounds are useful for the selective pre or post emergence weed control in crops, such as rice, wheat and barley. Alternatively, the subject compounds are useful to modify plant growth. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as selective or general herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.010 to 2 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for selective weed control or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate, and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow Seeds of crabgrass
