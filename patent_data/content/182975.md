# PRESSURE REGULATOR

## Abstract
A pressure regulator in which the bias urging the unseating of a poppet valve 28 is provided by a stepped piston 16 having a plurality of radial working surfaces 100, 102, 104, 106, each in its own separate pressure chamber 301 304. The chambers are selectively connected to the inlet 22, either singly or in various combinations, by solenoid valves 156. The unseating of the regulating valve is opposed by the outlet pressure which works on the entire back side 220 of the piston. In the preferred form a relationship exists between the relative sizes of the individual piston working surfaces so that all of the possible outlet pressures attainable by the regulator are equi spaced from atmospheric pressure to the highest regulated pressure.
