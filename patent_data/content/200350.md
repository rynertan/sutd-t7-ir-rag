# NUCLEIC ACID ENCODING A T CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR POLYPEPTIDE

## Abstract
A cDNA clone has been isolated which encodes the α chain of the T cell antigen receptor from a human T cell line, Jurkat. This encoded sequence is about 1101 nucleotides. The sequence may be used as a probe to determine whether an unknown cell is a T cell. Polypeptides encoded by the cDNA alone include about 277 amino acid residues compris ing the human T cell receptor α chain. Antibody to the polypeptide may be prepared and used to identify T cell antigen receptor and to assay for T cells.
