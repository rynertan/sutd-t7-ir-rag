## Description
CARIES PREVENTIVE COMPOSITION This invention relates to a caries preventive composition which, when applied to the mouth, can prevent dental caries by suppressing formation of dental plaque. Dental plaque firmly adhering to the surface of teeth is composed of about 70 bacteria, about 20 polysaccharides produced by the bacteria and about 10 food remains. It is said that acids stored in dental plaque decalcify enamel, causing dental caries. Therefore, dental plaque is observed as a cause of dental caries. Formation of dental plaque is accelerated due to the synthesis of polysaccharides from sucrose by oral bacteria, especially Streptococcus mutans. In more detail, Streptococcus mutans synthesizes adhesive polysaccharides such as dextran and mutan from sucrose through the production of GTF glucosyltransferase, dextran synthesizing enzyme . The thus synthesized polysaccharides incorporate Streptococcus mutans as well as other bacteria viruses , forming dental plaque having a given bacterial bouquet. In addition, bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans produce acids by utilizing various kinds of sugar and the thus produced acids decalcify the surface of enamel by remaining in polysaccharides and bacterial walls. Accordingly, it is desirable to decrease the number of Streptococcus mutans in the mouth and suppress the formation of dental plaque in order to prevent dental caries. It is known in British patent No.1,505,513 that colonization of Streptococcus mutans in the mouth is suppressed by using mother s milk obtained by immunizing a cow with whole bacterial bodies of Streptococcus mutans. The present inventors studied antibodies which are amongst the antibodies to various antigens derived from Streptococcus mutans and inhibit the colonization of Streptococcus mutans in the mouth. As a result, the inventors found that antibodies contained in antiserum and milk obtained by immunizing mammals withStreptococcus mutans, its cell wall fraction, fibrous substance fraction, glucosyltransferase fraction and protein antigen fraction have certain degrees of dentalplaque formation suppressing effect. However, the effect was not necessarily sufficient and a higher effect of suppressing the formation of dental plaque was necessary. An object of the present invention is to provide a caries preventive composition having an excellent effect in preventing dental caries. For the purpose of attaining the above object, the present inventors further conducted an intensive study, and, as a result, found that the combination of such an antibody and a fluorine compound, chlorhexidine or a chlorhexidine salt, a lytic enzyme, a bacteriocin, a glucosyltransferase inhibitor, a protease or a dextranase works effectively for the prevention of dental caries by causing a significantly increased dentalplaque formation suppressing effect through the suppression of colonization of Streptococcus mutans. Therefore, this invention provides a cariespreventive composition characterized by being composed of the combination of antibody obtained by immunizing a mammal with at least one antigen selected from the group consisting of Streptococcus mutans, its cell wall fraction, fibrous substance fraction, glucosyltransferase fraction and protein antigen fraction with at least one synergist selected from the group consisting of fluorine compounds, chlorhexidine and its salts, lytic enzymes, bacteriocins, glucosyltransferase inhibitors, proteases and dextranases. According to this invention, since the combination of said antibody and said synergist component exerts a synergistic effect on the inhibition of colonization of Streptococcus irutans in the mouth, the formation of dental plaque is efficiently suppressed, resulting in the effective prevention of dental caries. In addition, since said antibody and said synergist component both are quite safe, the cariespreventive composition of this invention can be safely used. The above and other objects, features, and advantages of this invention will be more fully understood by reading the following description. The caries preventive composition according to this invention is prepared by use of antibody contained in antiserum and or milk obtained by immunizing a mammal with at least one antigen selected from the group consisting of Streptococcus mutans, its cell wall fraction, fibrous substance fraction, glucosyltransferase GTF fraction and protein antigen fraction as described above.It should be noted that the fibrous substance means a pili like or fimbriae fraction. Streptococcus mutans used as an antigen may be prepared through well known culture and pretreatment carried out by, for example, growing bacteria in external solution obtained by the dialysis of BHI medium before the thus grown bacteria are washed and subjected to formalin treatment. Streptococcus mutans separated from human mouth and belonging to the serotypes C, D, E, F and G may preferably be used, particularly one belonging to the serotype C which is numerous in the human mouth. Such Streptococcus mutans includes NCTC10449, Ingbritt, OMZ70, JC 2, etc.and their mutant strains. The cell wall fraction of Streptococcus mutans may be prepared, for example, according to the method of Bleiweis et al. J. Bacteriol., 88, 1198 1200, 1964 by subjecting Streptococcus mutans to crushing treatment in a Brown s cell crusher and glass beads of 0.17 to 0.18 mm diameter, then treating the thus obtained cell walls with trypsin to remove protein contaminating the cell walls, followed by washing the cell walls with distilled water before they are lyophilized. The fibrous pili like or fimbriae substance fraction may be prepared, for example, according to the method of J. Van Hoate et al. Arch. Oral.Bio., 16, 1131 1141, 1971 by culturingStreptococcus mutans in a medium obtained by the dialysis of BHI medium and containing 5 sucrose under an anaerobic condition, then centrifuging the culture medium to obtain a supernatant solution, then adding three times as much ethanol as the supernatant solution by volume, followed by collecting the precipitate of the thus obtained solution. As the fibrous substance fraction there may also be used a pili like structure from the cell wall of Streptococcus mutans and its purified substance prepared by the ordinary cell wall extract method from the cultured bacteria, using solvents such as phosphate buffer containing IM sodium chloride according to the method of Tsurumizu et al. Japanese Journal of Bacteriology, 38, 1 471, 1983 . The GTF fraction may be prepared, for example, according to the method of Inoue et al. Microbial Aspects of dental caries Vol. III, 665 682, 1976 Information RetrievalInc. using a solution prepared by the following method after Streptococcus mutans is implanted and grown in a medium obtained by the dialysis of BHI medium, the bacterial bodies are removed by centrifugation and the supernatant is saturated with ammonium sulfate at the level of 409, followed by dialyzing the precipitate of the 40 ammonium sulfate fraction against 50 mM phosphate buffer solution and concentrating or diluting the obtained solution.The protein antigen fraction may be prepared, for example, according to the method of Lehner et al. J. General Microbiology, 122, 217 225, 1981 by culturing Streptococcus mutans in a medium obtained by the dialysis of BHI medium, then centrifuging the culture medium to obtain a supernatant solution, followed by fractionation with 75 ammonium sulfate solution to collect the precipitate the thus obtained precipitate is then subjected to DE 52 column chromatography under the existence of 6M urea, and the protein antigen fraction is dissolved in physiological saline, this being followed by dialyzing the thus obtained solution whereafter the dialyzed solution is subjected to gel filtration through Sepharose CL6B. The usual method may be adopted in immunizing mammals with said antigens. As mammals to be immunized, goats, sheep, horses, cows or rabbits may be used. The antibody protein fraction in the antiserum and the milk may be separated from the antiserum and the milk according to the ordinary antibody purification method including the salting out method, the gelfiltration method, ion exchange chromatography or affinity chromatography, the salting out method using ammonium sulfate being preferred. In the salting out method, the antiserum or the milk is saturated with ammonium sulfate, preferably at the level of not more than 40 , to produce the precipitate, followed by dialyzing the precipitate against physiological saline to obtain the purified precipitate as the antibody. The preferred antibody is obtained from the equine antiserum and the bovine antiserum and milk. In this invention, the antibody contained in the antiserum and milk obtained by immunizing the mammal with said antigen is blended into the composition. In this case, the antiserum and milk as well as the antibody separated and purified therefrom may be used. Each of these materials may be used alone or in a combination of two or more.

General Microbiology, 122, 217 225, 1981 was supplied for use. 2 Preparation of Antiserum and Mother s Milk Said antigen was mixed with Freund s complete adjuvant, and a pregnant goat, horse, cow or rabbit was immunized with the thus prepared mixture. After the animal vas immunized three times with the mixture of said antigen and Freund s incomplete adjuvant before its delivery, the colostrum was collected after the delivery. As to the antiserum, after the animal was immunized four times in the same manner as above, the blood was collected and coagulated, and supernatant solution obtained by centrifuging the coagulated blood was used as a sample. An antibody is prepared by adding ammonium sulfate to the antiserum to saturate it at the level of 40 , separating the obtained precipitate by centrifugation, and dialyzing the precipitate against physiological saline, and the inner solution was used as a sample. Next, the colonizing tests of Streptococcus mutans in the mouth were conducted according to the following method by using said antiserum and mother s milk as well as a fluorine compound, a chlorhexidine salt, a lytic enzyme, a bacteriocin, CTF inhibitors, a protease and a dextranase used as synergist components. 3 Colonization of Streptococcus mutans in the Mouth After male hamsters of five week old were divided into groups each consisting of five individuals, each hamster was inoculated with 1x108 bacteria of Streptococcus mutans of the NCTC10449 strain. From the day of the inoculation, drinking water containing the effective components said antiserum or milk and the synergist component was administered to each hamster. One week and four weeks after the start of the administration, the teeth of each hamster were rubbed with a cotton ball before it is immersed in a small amount of physiological saline to disperse bacteria homogeneously in it. After a given amount of the thus obtained solution was scattered on the BHI plate medium and the mitis salivalius plate medium, the number of whole bacteria and the number of the colonies ofStreptococcus mutans were counted.The number ofStreptococcus mutans was indicated by the number ofStreptococcus mutans per 10,000 whole bacteria.
