# Highly maleated wax and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
A maleated saturated hydrocarbon wax having a number average molecular weight of 500 through 6000, a content of a maleic anhydride unit of 14 through 40 by weight and a melt viscosity of 10² through 10⁶ centipoises at 140 C is disclosed. This maleated wax is self emulsifiable and the emulsion thereof can be stored for a long period of time, even in a very dilute emultion. This maleated wax is produced from the reaction of a saturated hydrocarbon wax with the specified amount of maleic anhydride, in the presence of an organic peroxide, at the specified tamperature, by adding the maleic anhydride and the organic peroxide to the molten saturated hydrocarbon wax at the specified rates.
