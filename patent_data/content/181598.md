## Description
The present invention relates to an active matrix type display apparatus and a driving method therefor, particularly an image display apparatus for displaying television images or pictures. A representative matrix type display apparatus is known from European Patent Application document EP A 0 079 496. The display described therein comprises transistors as switching elements for display elements which are arranged in the form of a matrix having a plurality of rows and a plurality of columns. All transistors of one row of that matrix are connected by a common gate line, and a driving means is provided to sequentially drive said gate lines so as to vertically scan that gate lines during a vertical scanning period. If such kind of display is used as television image display, an interlaced scanning system is to be used for displaying images. In the interlaced scanning system, every second line is successively scanned horizontally and one whole picture is formed by 2 times fields of successive scanning. If the frequency of a vertical scanning is 60 Hz, one whole picture is displayed at a frequency of 30 Hz. This interlaced scanning system has advantages that the flickering of the picture is minimized and the level of minimum frequency for image signals can be increased, when compared with a non interlaced scanning system wherein all the scanning lines are successively and downwardly scanned line by line. On the other hand, when a liquid crystal device is driven by an AC voltage, the polarity of the driving voltage is required to be inverted every field. As a result, the driving frequency for each picture element is one half that of one field, i.e., 15 Hz for the NTSC system. However, such low frequency driving involves some problems. In an active matrix type liquid crystal panel, each picture element is driven in such a manner that a voltage is stored in the capacitance thereof. Actually, however, it is difficult to store and hold the voltage in a frequency of 15 Hz. Alternatively, if the driving voltage is increased in order to compensate the lowering in voltage, it is necessary to increase the withstand voltage of the driving circuit. However, this makes it very difficult to use an integrated circuit as driving circuit. The low frequency also leads to occurrence of noticeable flickering. According to the a.m. document EP A 0 079 496 this problem may be solved by additionally providing a second transistor and a capacitor for every matrix display element. It is quite clear that this measure increases the technical effort necessary for manufacturing and operating such kind of display system. In view of the a.m. problems of the prior art, it is the object of the present invention to provide an image display apparatus and a driving method therefor, by which a high image quality can be achieved in a very simple way and without a high technical effort. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an active matrix display comprising According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a driving method for an active matrix type display comprising the steps of Thus, it is possible to simultaneously drive more than one gate line, thereby minimizing the flickering frequency of the displayed image in a very simple way. It is quite clear that the use of this display system and this method for driving said display system is not limited to systems which are driven by an AC voltage this is only an arbitrary example for explaining the function and the advantages of the present invention. These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon a consideration of the following description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 is a circuit diagram for showing a basic arrangement of the apparatus accordng to the invention Figure 2 is a view showing a relationship between the scanning lines on a TV picture frame Figure 3 is a view showing a detailed equivalent circuit diagram of a liquid crystal cell unit LC₁₁, ... or LC Technical feature of the present invention will now be described with reference to a specific embodiment. Referring to Figure 1, reference numeral 1 denotes an image signal input terminal 2, an amplifier for amplifying the input image signal 3, an inverter for inverting and amplifying the amplified image signal 4, a polarity inversion switch for selecting either one of the outputs of the amplifier 2 and inverter 3 depending on the polarity of a signal obtained by dividing into a half the frequency of a vertical synchronizing signal which will be mentioned hereinafter T₁ T Referring again to Figure 1, an image signal such as an television signal is inputted to the image signal input terminal 1 and amplified to an amplitude level appropriate for driving the liquid crystal. The amplified image signal is supplied to the switch 4 and the inverter 3. The switch 4 selects the output of the amplifier 2 or inverter 3 depending on the polarity of the output signal from the pulse generator 9 and provides an image signal the polarity of which is inverted every vertical scanning period for applying a vertical synchronizing signal shown at COM in Figure 4 . This is an operation required for AC driving a liquid crystal. The signal is applied to the common terminal of the switches T₁ T A circuit structure according to a first embodiment of the invention has been described with reference to Figure 1. Here, some explanations will be made with respect to a relation between the scanning lines and the structure and operation of a liquid crystal picture element in a case where a display is actually provided on a picture frame. Figure 2 illustrates an arrangement of scanning lines on a television picture frame, wherein lines 1 , 2 , ... correspond to lines 1 , 2 , ... in Figure 4. When the above mentioned scanning operation is conducted by using a circuit as shown in Figure 1, information signals on lines 1 and 2 , are written in picture elements LC₁₁ LC Next, the structure and operation of a picture element is explained with reference to Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows an equivalent circuit depicted in rather detail of one of the picture elements LC₁₁ LC Referring to Figure 3, an image signal sampled and held in the manner described above is applied to a source line S and a vertical scanning signal is applied to a gate line G. The TFT is an FET field effect transistor formed of a film of, e.g., amorphous silicon, and the source drain is made conductive when the gate line G is turned ON so that a voltage on the source line S is transferred to the equivalent capacitance C In the above embodiment, the COM signal is inverted every field. Instead thereof, the inversion may be carried out for each horizontal scanning period. A second embodiment adopting this system will be explained hereinbelow. The circuit structure to be used in the second embodiment is substantially the same as that for the first embodiment as shown in Figure 1. The only difference is that the switch 4 is changed over every horizontal scanning period. Figure 5 shows driving waveforms in this case. The COM signal shown in Figure 5 is inverted every horizontal scanning period, and the inversion phases are controlled by the pulse generator 9 so as to be switched every two fields. The COM signal is distributed to source lines S₁ S As described above, in the present invention, the gate lines of TFTs are scanned sequentially and two lines at a time and the combination phase or pattern of two lines to be scanned simultaneously are changed every field, whereby a voltage decrease due to leakage through a liquid crystal is compensated. As a result, a higher withstand voltage for a driving circuit is obviated to facilitate the integration of the circuit. Further, the image quality is improved because the flickering is minimized.
