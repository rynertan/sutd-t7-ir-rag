## Description
The present invention relates to a method for manufacture of chloride and or sulphate containing NPK fertilizer complex fertilizer having reduced tendency for swelling and caking. The fertilizer is manufactured by acidulation of phosphate with a mineral acid and subsequent removal of calcium salt, evaporation and prilling or granulation. During storage, especially bulk storage, caking and or swelling of the fertilizer particles have been experienced for certain NPK fertilizers. The problem seems partly to depend on the type of potassium source applied, i.e. KCl or K₂SO₄. In newly produced fertilizer the particles are free flowing, but slow after reactions will take place and some of these evidently lead to increasing volume and caking of the particles. If one is able to keep operating conditions giving a low content of water 0,35 during the production, it seems that the above mentioned problem can be avoided. However, in practice such strict conditions will lead to a very sensitive process, and it has often been found that this results in problems related to obtaining acceptable storage properties of the product even when one thought that these strict operating conditions had been observed. The question is then whether the high content of water as such creates the storage problems or whether it is the presence of loosely bound mobile water which makes some unfortunate after reactions possible. It is previously known from Japanese patent application No. 2.000.652 to stabilize NPK fertilizers against moisture and temperature variations by adding magnesium hydroxide in amounts of 0,5 1,0 weight calculated as MgO. However, such addition comprises incorporation of water and will not solve the problem one was facing. GB A 951,960 discloses a solid fertilizer material containing as one of its components ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulphate nitrate and also containing 2 to 20 by weight of magnesium chloride based on the weight of ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulphate nitrate. Preferably, the magnesium chloride is in the form of carnallite, KMgCl₃ 6H₂O. Chemical Abstracts 81 1974 119209n teaches that the addition of Al 0.3 1.0 , Fe³ 0.6 2.0 , or Mg 0.2 0.6 in the form of compounds that are soluble either in H₂O or in the acid digesting medium to which they are added prevents the autodecomposition of a fertilizer. Al, Fe³ or Mg are added in the form of their sulphates, nitrates, chlorides, or phosphates. These two documents disclose the addition of magnesium to a fertilizer in the form of water soluble or acid soluble salts, i.e. sulphates, nitrates, chlorides, or phosphates. The addition of magnesium salts, however, cannot solve satisfactorily the problems due to swelling and caking of the fertilizer during storage. As known methods which could solve the problem could not be found, the inventors considered further investigations necessary to determine the real cause of the storage problems. It was then close at hand to start with the theory of after reactions. A possible variable here is the type of potassium salt used, and one started by studying possible after reactions for KCl and K₂SO₄ respectively, for later on to see whether one could prevent or strongly delay possible undesired after reactions. According to experience, only certain NPK formulations cause problems, and therefore one studied some of those which had been found to contain particles that increased their volume during storage change of volume of several percents . This resulted in crumbling of the particles and caking problems. One of these NPK formulations was manufactured from a water solution having roughly the following composition by weight The mixture comprises a complicated chemical system, and the same components will most likely not be found in corresponding amounts in the finished product. The system can not be considered as a mechanical mixture of salts as moisture is present and because large temperature differences are involved. NH₄NO₃ AN , which is the most important main component, can pass through several phases during solidification and further cooling down to room temperature. Each transformation will for one thing result in volume changes. For instance will the transformation from AN III to AN IV increase the volume with about 3,6 . The chemical reaction which seems to be a core reaction in the swelling mechanism is, however, a salt pair transition which can be read as follows During studies of the swelling phenomena it was shown by chemical analyses and X ray diffractometry that this salt pair conversion took place in sulphate based fertilizer. The conversion already started in the mixer and continued during bulk storage. The reaction velocity proved to be strongly dependent of firstly the water content and secondly the temperature, but also the chemical composition at large. When the reaction is according to equation 1 , the salt pair conversion will result in serious swelling or expansion. If AN is present in form III, the expansion is 5,3 , while it will be 7,7 if AN is in form IV. Transformation from form III to IV will, as known, take place at 32 The volume increase resulting from the salt pair conversion can not alone explain the swelling phenomena. However, investigations showed that both KNO₃ and NH₄ ₂SO₄ will react further and form new compounds. In order to determine whether the salt pair conversion A good correlation was found between the percent swelling degree and the amount of unreacted NH₄NO₃, which confirmed that the salt pair conversion is the main reaction of the swelling mechanism. The degree of swelling S can be defined as where When KCl is used as potassium source, the conversion can in a simplified form be written as follows KCl shall not exist freely at equilibrium. The amount of NH₄NH₃ which can be converted can easily be calculated when the amount of KCl added is known. The conversion was found to take place at higher velocity when the content of mobile water was high. How far this reaction has gone to the right was investigated by selective extraction of NH₄NO₃ from the finished product. Series of samples were investigated to determine how large part of the NH₄NO₃ present reacted with KCl to NH₄Cl and KNO₃. The caking tendency for the same samples was also measured and was found to increase by increasing part of NH₄NO₃ converted. As the reaction, as stated above, is a function of mobile water present, one assumed that said conversion could be prevented or at least delayed by in some way reducing the amount of mobile water. Accordingly, it seemed that in certain fertilizer formulations having some free water present, after reactions occurred both when KCl and K₂SO₄ were used as potassium source and that these after reactions gave the product undesired properties. As it previously was found to be difficult to obtain products having a sufficiently low content of water by ordinary regulation of the operating conditions, one started to investigate the possibilites for binding the mobile water in the finished NPK fertilizer. The object of the present invention was to arrive at a NPK fertilizer containing KCl and or K₂SO₄ and were stable during storage, especially bulk storage, such that no swelling and or caking of the fertilizer particles occurred. A further object was to arrive at a simple and rational way of manufacturing such products. Several additives which are known to bind water are known, for instance in connection with NH₄NO₃, where it for several reasons is of interest to use water binding additives. However, it is not obvious that such additives will be suitable for solving the above problem with NPK fertilizers. The inventors had therefore to investigate whether other additives could be suitable for the present purpose. During the selection of additives one also had to take into account which reactions could possibly occur between the additives and the salts in the fertilizer. Further, the additives had to be acceptable agronomically such that they would not diminish the agronomic qualities of the product. In view of the above mentioned requirements, one first started to investigate the effect of some additives on NPK fertilizers containing K₂SO₄ as potassium source. In this test series unhydrous Na₂SO₄ was tried out. This salt can bind up to 10 mol H₂O as crystal water, i.e. 1,26 g H₂O per gram Na₂SO₄, and should accordingly give good effect provided that it did not react and thereby form compounds which did not have water binding properties. Closer investigation of Na₂SO₄ showed that it had low water binding effect in this salt system. Al OH ₃, which is a known water binding additive, was added in an amount of 0,1 g Al per 100 g of a synthetic NPK solution. However, it was found that this additive did not give any significant effect. Magnesium, in the form of kieserite, is a desired component in several NPK fertilizers. It was therefore investigated whether MgO had the ability to bind the remaining moisture and therefore could be used instead of kieserite. Some tests were run with the addition of 1 lightly calcined, finely ground MgO to a synthetic nitrogen phosphorous solution NP solution together with K₂SO₄. Particles made from this solution were stored for some time and tested with respect to volume increase swelling . It was then found that addition of MgO had a very good effect. This possibly happened because MgO reacts with the NP solution under formation of Mg NO₃ ₂ and magnesium phosphates possibly MgHPO₄ . These salts have the ability to bind several mol water as crystal water per mol salt. The effect was detected by direct measurement of the equilibrium pressure over the product. The measurements indicated that the water vapour pressure was halved when 1,6 MgO was added. The water binding effect was also observed as a decrease in the NH₄NO₃ conversion when MgO was added. It was surprisingly observed that in spite of the lower water vapour pressure a lower water retaining velocity was attained when the samples contained 1,6 MgO. Several different reactions can take place when MgO is added to a NP solution together with KCl K₂SO₄. The following can be formed The results of the above mentioned preliminary investigations were most positive, and the inventors found it correct to further investigate the effect of additional MgO to fertilizers which according to experience could give storage problems. It was also investigated how and where in the process the MgO should be added. These investigations showed that one could obtain a method for manufacture of chloride and or sulphate containing NPK fertilizers having reduced tendency for swelling and caking, by acidulation of phosphate with a mineral acid and subsequent removal of calcium salt, evaporation and prilling or granulation, and by applying KCl and or K₂SO₄ as potassium source, wherein 0.2 3.0 reactive MgO and potassium salts are added to the evaporated solution before prilling or before during granulation. Already at an addition of 0.2 by weight MgO a positive effect was attained. 1 2 weight was found to be the most suitable amount, but up to 3 weight MgO can be used. One also arrived at a suitable fertilizer which is obtainable by the method of the present invention. The special features of the invention are as defined in the claims. The invention will now be further explained in the following examples This example shows the results of a full scale experiment for manufacture of NPK 14 4 17, where K₂SO₄ is used as potassium source. This fertilizer should also contain 1 Mg, and this was added as kieserite MgSO₄ . The experiment was first run without MgO addition in order to get some reference samples, then 0,6 MgO was added and thereupon 1 MgO. The amount of kieserite was reduced, on Mg basis , corresponding to the amount of MgO added. The MgO used had a bulk weight of about 0,6 kg l having a particle size distribution of 2 6 mm 0 30 , 0,5 2 mm 40 70 and less than 0,5 mm 20 40 . The MgO was added together with K₂SO₄ and kieserite before they were supplied to the mixer and mixed with concentrated NP solution. Samples for the swelling test and chemical analysis were taken during the experiment. The result of the experiments are shown in Table I. Samples 1 and 4 did not contain MgO, samples 2 and 3 contained 0,6 and 1 MgO respectively. The results of the swelling tests at 60 This example shows the results of a full scale experiment for manufacture of NPK 25 3 6, where KCl was used as potassium source. The experiments were first run without any MgO addition and thereupon 1,6 MgO was added directly into the mixer for the NP solution, KCl and MgO, whereupon the mixture was prilled. The pH of the product was measured and also its water vapour pressure just after formation of the prills and after 25 days of storage in bulk. The results are given in Table II. Table II shows clearly that MgO gives a very strong water binding effect and accordingly lowers the water vapour pressure For fertilizers with and without MgO and stored for 25 days the was 4,7 mb and 9,8 mb respectively. is an expression for water bound in the fertilizer. Generally speaking, it is assumed that the water absorption velocity of the fertilizer and thereby its caking tendency is largest for fertilizers having a low However, it was surprisingly found that fertilizer having 1,6 MgO and a low value for was less hygroscopic than fertilizers without Mgo. A possible explanation can be that MgO and H₂O form a film or coating on the particles and thereby reduce the water absorption. The caking test was also carried out at 65 relative humidity and at 25 The caking numbers K is an expression for the fertilizer s caking tendency. Low values for the caking numbers show that the fertilizer had a low caking tendency. When K 0, the fertilizer is completely free flowing, K 150 is considered acceptable, while K 300 might cause problems during bulk storage. From the examples it can be seen that the problems one had with certain NPK types of fertilizers were solved by addition of MgO and this was also the case when KCl and K₂SO₄ was used as potassium source. The necessary amount of MgO will vary somewhat according to the type of NPK fertilizer in question, but further investigations showed that an addition of 0,2 3,0 MgO was sufficient. When every condition was taken into account, it was found that addition of 1 2 MgO gave the best results. Further, finely ground MgO and of a lightly calcined type should preferably be used. It is not very critical where the MgO is added in the process, but it has to take place after acidulation of the rock phosphate with mineral acid. It was found that the MgO should preferably be added just before prilling or granulation, preferably in the mixer where the NP solution and the additive salts were mixed.
