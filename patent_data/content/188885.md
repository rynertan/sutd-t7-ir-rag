# Machine for sewing casings for quilts or the like.

## Abstract
Sewing heads 40, 41 of a sewing apparatus for sewing casings for quilts are arranged in two horizontal parallel rows which are perpendicular to the stitching direction. For forming zig zag partitions the heads 40 of the upper row are staggered with respect to those 41 of the lower row. Pleats 42 formed in the upper facing 30 are guided together with the upper edges of a pair of divider strips 32 into the stitching zones of the upper heads 40 and pleats 43 of the lower fac ing 31 are guided with the lower edges of two divider strips 32 of adjoining pairs into stitching zones of the lower heads 41 . For forming transverse partitions, a single row of sewing heads, each having two stitching zones, may be used, a separate divider strip 32 being fed to each sewing head.
