# Improved solids mass flow indication.

## Abstract
Apparatus for indicating mass flow of a solid particulate material through a star wheel feeder 14,16 having a radiation source 32 and detectors 34A, 34B so positioned that radiation flux 36 is directed through, and attenuated by, particulate material 24 contained in the pockets 18 of the star wheel. The detected signal is indicative of the mass of particulate material 24 contained within the pockets 18 and is used with a feeder speed signal to determine mass flow through the feeder 14,16 .
