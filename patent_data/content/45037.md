# Magnetically actuated viscous fluid coupling.

## Abstract
A viscous fan clutch 10 is typically employed in a fan drive mechanism within a truck or automobile. A shaft 12 driven by the engine, rotates a clutch member 24 within the fan drive. The clutch member is arranged for fluid engagement with a body member 42 for the transmission of torque thereto when the fluid is disposed in an operating chamber 70 defined by complimentary shear surfaces 30 56 in the clutch and body members. During relative rotation between the two members, fluid is pumped from the operating chamber to a storage chamber 76 . Fluid is returned to the operating chamber via bleed ports 94 which are selectively restricted by an electromagnetically con trolled valve 88 . A control system 110 senses vehicle coolant temperature and actuates the valve as a func tion thereof.
