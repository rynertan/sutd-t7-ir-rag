# Method and apparatus for ion analysis and detection using reverse mode suppression.

## Abstract
A method of ion analysis and detection of weakly dissociated anions or cations in an eluent by first separating such ions on a chromatographic separation medium by ion exclusion chromatography or mobile phase ion exclusion chromatography. The eluent includes an acid or base with a co ion of the same charge as the ions to be separated, such co ions being in the hydronium or hydroxide form. In one embodiment the effluent from the separation medium is contacted with one side of an ion exchange membrane 20 having exchangeable ions of opposite charge to the ionic species. The opposite side of the membrane includes a regenerant with salt forming suppression ions capable of forming a weakly conducting salt with the co ions. Then the separated ionic species are detected preferably by a conduc tivity detector 12 . In another embodiment, the membrane is replaced by a resin bed with ion exchangig sites of opposite charge to the co ions. There, co ions form a suppressed salt with the exchangeable ions.
