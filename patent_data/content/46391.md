# Composition for partitioning blood components.

## Abstract
A composition for use in partitioning blood components comprises a mixture of 1 a thixotropy imparting agent, 2 a first viscous liquid material having strong interaction with the thixotropy imparting agent, and 3 a second viscous liquid material having no strong in teraction with the thixotropy imparting agent and having good compatibility with the first viscous liquid material, said composition having a specific gravity at 20 C of from 1.03 to 1.08. When the composition and a sample of blood are sub jected to centrifugal separation the composition forms a parti tioning wall between a serum or plasma phase and a phase containing solids such as erythrocytes.
