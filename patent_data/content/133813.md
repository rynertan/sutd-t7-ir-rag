# Improved piston and driver.

## Abstract
An improved piston and driver structure includes a synthetic piston body 20 , a slotted bifurcated piston insert 21 and a driver 22 secured within the insert 21 by means of a pin 23 and by means of frictional engagement of the driver 22 by the piston insert 21 when the insert 21 is assembled to the piston body 20 . The piston insert 21 has an enlarged top 40 for dissipating operating pressures over the piston body 20 .
