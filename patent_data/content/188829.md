# Colour cathode ray tube in line electron gun.

## Abstract
In a colour cathode ray tube having an in line electron gun with overlapping CFF lenses, the small openings of the focus ing electrode apertures are critically enlarged to balance the asymmetry of the lensing field caused by the overlap, and beam spot distortion due to field asymmetries in the focus re gion is eliminated. Enlargement is achieved by elongating the openings in a direction normal to the in line plane, and widen ing the outer openings.
