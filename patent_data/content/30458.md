# TRANSDUCER DRIVE AND CONTROL IN ULTRASOUND IMAGING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
In an ultrasound imaging system employing a moving or oscillating transducer, actual transducer position is detected periodically, rather than continuously. A magnet is caused to oscillate with the transducer, and periodic alignment of the magnet with a fixedly mounted Hall effect switch provides syn chronization data for sonic pulse generation, pulse echo re ceipt, and image assembly and display.
