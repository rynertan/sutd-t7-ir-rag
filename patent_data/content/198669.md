## Abstract
Manufacturing apparatus for sheet metal according to continuous casting, which comprises a pair of chill rolls 10, 20 and a vessel 30 containing molten metal MM . One 10 of said rolls is of a larger diameter on which the other roll 20 of a smaller diameter is arranged at a position of 12 3 o clock. Said vessel 30 having a forward end open is arranged so as to contact with said larger roll 10 or leave a gap as narrow as possible. Said smaller roll 20 is dipped in molten metal in said vessel. When said two rolls are driven at the same peripheral velocity in the opposite direction, molten metal is fed between said rolls to form a sheet metal which may be continuously peeled from the larger roll surface.
