# A power source for an electric discharge machine.

## Abstract
A power source for a wire cut electric discharge machine is designed to increase the cutting speed and improve the surface smoothness of a work piece. A capacitor C for supply ing a discharge energy across a wire electrode WR and the workpiece WK is always charged by a DC power supply Vs, and the charged voltage is applied across the machining gap via a switching element TR. The switching element TR is turned ON when the charged voltage of the capacitor C reaches a predetermined level, and turned OFF when the charged voltage becomes substantially zero, permitting rapid charging of the capacitor C and the generation of a uniform discharge energy.
