# Electrically alterable double dense memory.

## Abstract
An electrically alterable double dense memory is pro vided which includes a field effect transistor 10 having first and second spaced apart diffusion regions 14, 16 of a first conductivity defining a channel region 18 at the surface of a semiconductor substrate 12 having a second conductivity. First and second floating gates 22, 24 are disposed over the first and second diffusion regions, respectively, and each extends over an end of the channel region 18 . First and second dual charge injector structures 26, 36 or enhanced conduction insulators are disposed between the first and second floating gates 22, 24 and a common control gate 28 of the transistor. A word line WL1 is connected to the control gate 28 and first and second bit lines BL1, BL2 are connected to the first and second diffusion regions 14, 16 . By applying 48, 50 appropriate pulses to the word and bit lines, a selected floating gate can be charged to alter the conductivity of the end of the channel region 18 associated with the selected floating gate and then discharged at will. In this manner binary digits of information are stored in each of the two floating gates 22, 24 and altered as desired. By applying 48 appropriate voltages to the control gate and to one of the first and second diffusion regions 14, 16 , the stored information or charge condition of the floating gate associated with the other of the first and second diffusion regions can be determined.
