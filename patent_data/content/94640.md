# Fuel pumping apparatus.

## Abstract
A fuel pumping apparatus for internal combustion engine has a working chamber 30 which is divided into two chamber sections 33, 34 by a shuttle 32 disposed therein, and a pumping chamber 41 independent from the working chamber 30. After a delivery of a fuel into one of the chamber sections 33 and the pumping chamber 41, the one chamber section 33 is brought into communication with an injection nozzle 60 and the pumping chamber 41 is made to communi cate with the other chamber section 34. Then, the volume of the pumping chamber 41 is decreased and the fuel is pumped into the other chamber section 34 from the pumping chamber 41, so that the fuel in the one chamber section 33 is pumped into the injector nozzle 60 through the shuttle 32 by means of the fuel contained in the other chamber section 34.
