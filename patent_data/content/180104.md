# Microwave device.

## Abstract
A microwave device comprises a substrate and fine metal particles having diameters of 0.1 Âµm or smaller and arranged in a regular pattern on the substrate. In the prefer red embodiment of the present invention, the substrate is subjected to an electron beam irradiation in a strip pattern and then metal or alloy is deposited onto the irradiated area, thereby forming a regular arrangement of fine metal particle deposits which has not been successfully achieved by any prior art technique. The thus obtained device has a greatly improved high frequency characteristics.
