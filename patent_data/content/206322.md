## Description
The present invention refers to pharmaceutical compositions containing, as an active principle, therapeutically effective amounts of non toxic, physiologically acceptable salts of N 2 carboxy ethyl 1,8 naphthaleneimide, of formula I such as an alkali, earth alkali, ammonium salt, salts with basic aminoacids such as lysine, ornithine and arginine, with primary, secondary or tertiary amines, or with aminosugars. The lysine and N methylglucamine are particularly preferred and provide a further object of the invention. The compound I is endowed with inhibitory activity of the aldose reductase, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of hexoses to polyols such as sorbitol and dulcitol. In the presence of high hexoses levels, as it occurs for instance in the diabetes and in the galactosemias, an accumulation of said polyols occurs in some tissues, and particularly in the eye, at the level of retina and crystalline, lens in the kidneys and in the peripheral nerves, with consequent onset of retinopathies, neuropathies and nephropathies which are the main complications of diabetes. The compositions containing the compound I are therefore useful in human therapy for the treatment of retinopathies, neuropathies and nephropathies on diabetic basis. The compound I is known, having been described by El Naggar et al. in Egypt. J. Chem. The U.S. Patent No. 3,821,383 discloses pharmaceutical compositions useful in the treatment of diabetes related complications, containing as the active principle the N 2 carboxy methyl 1,8 naphthaleneimide or 1,3 dioxo 1H benzo de isoquinoline 2 3H acetic acid. Said compound is therefore the lower homolog of the compound I which is however surprisingly more active and endowed with more advantageous pharmaco therapeutics characteristics. FR A 2521139 claims the use of N 4 carboxy propyl 1,8 naphthaleneimide and its salts for the same pathology. The compound I hereinbelow also referred to, for the sake of brevity, with the abbreviation The topical route of administration is particularly important in the ophtalmic field because the etiological role played by aldose reductase in the cataract with darkening of the crystalline lens and in the retinopathies induced by galactosemia and diabetes, is known. Suitable forms for the oral administration are capsules, tablets, sugar coated tablets, syrups, solutions. Suitable forms for the parenteral administration are sterile vials or bottles containing the active principle, optionally mixed with a suitable carrier. The dosage of The unitary dosage forms for oral or parenteral administration may comprise from 10 to about 500 mg, administered from 1 to 4 times a day. The compound I is prepared from β alanine and 1,8 naphthalic anhydride, according to the following example. 10 Grams 1 mole of 1,8 naphthalic anhydride were added to a 98 solution of β alanine 5.05 g, 1.1 mole and sodium hydroxide 2.26 g in 50 ml of water. After 6 hours at reflux, the mixture was cooled, acidified with diluted HCl and filtered. After washing with H₂O and double recrystallization from ethanol 95 , 6.42 g of 1.1 Grams of L lysine were added to a solution of 2 g of The N methylglucamine salt was similarly prepared, by using, instead of lysine, 1.5 g of methylglucamine. The acute toxicity of The acute toxicity of Crystallin lenses of adult male rats have been homogenized in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.2. The surnatant, after centrifugation at 3000 x g for 15 minutes, has been used. The surnatant contained 13 mg ml of proteins. Quercitrin Fluka, Buchs 1 mM dissolved in DMSO H₂O 1 10 has been used. The aldose reductase activity has been tested by the method described by S.D. Varma and J.H. Kinoshita Biochem. Pharmacol. The platelet antiaggregant activity of The aggregation was induced by the addition of ADP and collagene at the specified concentrations. The results are reported in the following Tables. According to the values reported in the Tables,
