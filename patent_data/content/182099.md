# Radiation image recording and read out apparatus.

## Abstract
A radiation image recording and read out apparatus 1 comprises a circulation transfer means for transferring a stimulable phosphor sheet 30 along a predetermined cir culation path an image recording section 41 which is disposed in the circulation path and in which a radiation image of an object is recorded on the stimulable phosphor sheet by exposing the stimulable phosphor sheet to radia tion passing through the object 43 an image read out section 50 which is disposed in the circulation path for scanning the stimulable phosphor sheet with stimulating rays and detecting light emitted from the stimulable phos phor sheet to obtain an image signal and an erasing section 70 which is disposed in the circulation path and releases residual radiation energy in the stimulable phosphor sheet before the stimulable phosphor sheet is returned to the image recording section. The radiation image recording and read out apparatus further includes a radiation quality changing filter 102 for changing the quality of the radiation. The filter is arranged to be inserted into or retracted away from the path of the radiation in synchronization with the operation of a stimulable phosphor sheet changing mecha nism for discharging one stimulable phosphor sheet from the recording position in the image recording section and positioning another sheet in the recording section.
