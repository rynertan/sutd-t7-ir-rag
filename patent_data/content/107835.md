# Polyphenylene ether resin compositions.

## Abstract
The present invention deals with polymer blends com prising a polyphenylene ether and optionally polystyrene or a rubber modified polystyrene. It has been found that the addition of an alkyl or aralkyl sulfonate to such blends improves the environmental stress cracking resistance of such blends.
