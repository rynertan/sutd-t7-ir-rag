## Description
DESCRIPTION INTUMESCENT COMPOSITION This invention relates to a novel intumescent composition containing methylated methylol melamine, an hydroxy containing organo phosphorus compound, an organo phosphorous acid, and water. It is difficult to impart durable flame retardance to a wood substrate. Wood substrates present a flameproofing problem which is materially different from that presented by fibrous hydrophilic organic substrates. According to U. S. patent 2,927,050 in the latter substrate . . . substantially independent fibers are tan gled together, leaving interstices capable of being filled by an aqueous medium by capillary action between all of their surfaces.The individual fibers contain a relatively small amount of cellu lose, and the materials composed of them have a relatively low ignition temperature. In wood substrates, however, . . . the cellulosic fibers are bonded together to form a relatively impenetrable block susceptible to little capillary action. A piece of wood has small surface area in relation to the amount of surface area it contains and has a relatively high ignition temperature. Because of these factors, . .. a flameproofing agent which flameproofs fibrous hydrophilic organic materials is not likely to flameproof wood because its capacity to inhibit burning is likely to be destroyed by the time it is heated to the ignition temperature of the wood and or because of the difficulty of causing a non volatile substance to penetrate into the volume of a block of wood. Impregnation of a wood substrate with a fire retardant is known in the art. U. S. patent 3,398,019 teaches that this method must be used to impart a satisfactory degree of flame retardancy to wood fiber insulation, stating that as far as is known only by the use of a chemical rctardant which impregnates the board can a commercially acceptable building material be produced which is capable of securing a nonflainmable rating. U. S.patent 4,049,849 teaches that this method, although well known, presents several substantial problems. According te this parent the use of a wood substrate impregnated with a fire tardant salt is restricted to low humidity applications . . . due to the water solubility and hygroscopicity of most known fire retardant salts. Thus, . . . if an ammonium phosphate impregnated wood substrate is exposed to high greater than 90 percent humidity at ambient temperature, in approximately 3 days the fire retardant impregnant salt will leach therefrom. . . . The salt will absorb sufficient water vapor to enable it to migrate to the wood substrate surface.Not only does this leaching deplete the salt content of the wood substrate, rendering it less fire resistant, but it also severely disfigures the wood substrate S surface. . . . Many of the flame retardants which are used to impregnate wood substrates are acidic and hygroscopic. U. S. patent 3,811,992 teaches that the use of these compositions dehydrates the wood and that . . . the wood, in order to make up for the dehydration caused by these hygroscopic agents, must absorb waters from the moisture in the ambient air. Such moisture absorption will tend to discolor the plywood and rust and stain connecting members such as nails and it . . .dilutes the amount of agent used in the wood . . . and causes the wood to be damp and moist thus not only corroding the wood but subjecting it to attack from insects and the like. . . Those in the art have attempted to impart durable flame retardance to wood substrates by applying intumescent compositions to them. Many intumescent compositions have been tested U. S.patent 3,668,121 correctly states that only a few of them are of any value. Many of them produce excessive smoke andjor toxic gaseous ryrolysçs products. According to U. S. patent 3,769,074, most of LLF eS I ilj 2r art intumescent compositions are . . . characterized by the disadvantages of high cost, low spreading rate, relatively poor efficiency, and poor weatherability . U. S. patent 3,513,114 teaches that prior art intumescent coating compositions . .. exhibit the distinct disadvantage of either or both failing to maintain a coating film which will withstand repeated scrubbing or washing and thus exhibit wet abrasion resistant properties and or failing to perform their intended function, that is, to intumesce, and thus fire retard after repeated scrubbing or washing U. S. patent 3,535,130 teaches that . . conventional intumescent paints are usually sensitive to attack by water. . . . U. S. patent 3,654,190 discloses that prior art intumescent compositions are water permeable and tend to degrade when exposed to moist environments. U. S. patent 3,513,114 discloses that the problems presented by the prior art intumescent compositions cannot be solved merely by replacing the water soluble flame retardant agents they contain with water insoluble additives, for such substitution does not necessarily increase the wet abrasion resistance properties of the compositions. Furthermore, such a substitution will present a new set of problems if the water insoluble additive must be dissolved in an organic solvent for many dangers are created by the use of the common organic solvents. Toluene, for example, is a fire hazard and an explosion hazard when exposed to heat and flame and it emits toxic fumes. Methylene chloride is very dangerous to the eyes. Benzene is highly flammable, causes leukemia, and it is a known carcinogen. Acetone is a fire hazard when exposed to either heat or flame.Methanol possesses narcotic properties and exerts a toxic effect upon the nervous system once it is absorbed into the body, it is eliminated very slowly and, thus, is a cumulative poison. The use of almost any of the ccn mon organic solvents will present some hazard. U. S. patent 3,654,190 teaches that many prior art intumescent coating compositionS are soft and 1prone to chip with rough handling . Other prior art considered by the applicants during the preparation of this application includes U. S. patent 2,711,998 a composition containing trimethylol melamine and the amnonium salt of halopropyl phosphoric acid used to flame retard cotton ,U. S. patent 2,676,162 an intumescent coating for wood containing organic solvent, methylated methylol melamine, the reaction product of ammonia and phosphoryl chloride, and a film forming condensation product , U. S. patent 3,449,161 fire retardancy can be incorporated into paint compositions using organo phosphorous amides , U..S. patent 3,635,970 melamine pbosphate is especially useful in intumescent paint compositions , U.S. patent 4,026,810 an intumescent flame retardant prepared by reacting, e.g., phosphoric oxide, phosphoric acid, pentaerythritol, and melamine and thereafter curing the reaction product by heating to evolve gaseous products , U. S. patent 2,582,961 an aqueous flame retardant for cellulosic fiber containing, e.g., methylated methylol melamine, methylol dicyandiamide, and an oxygen containing acid of phosphorus , U. S. patent 2,661,342 flameproofing of cellulosic materials with a resinous aminoplast condensation product such as melamine and a water soluble nitrogen and phosphoruscontaining product , U. S. patent 3,023,176 a water soluble hardenable condensation product which is prepared by reacting a methylol compound of the aminotriazine group, an aliphatic compound containing a chain of at least 7 carbon atoms and a reactive hydrogen bound to a hetero atom, and a compound that is capable of introducing atomic groupings that raise the hydrophility in a non ionic manner , U. S. patent 3,101,278 methylol phosphorus polymers which have nitrogen atoms ncorporated into them arse excellent flame retardants and are suitable for treating cellu losic materials 7 and U. S. patent 3,332,240 an aqueous solution for flameproofing cotton fiber containing a salt of hydroxylamine and melamine resin . It does not appear that the prior art describes an aqueous composition which can impart durable flame retardance to wood substrates even after repeated exposure to water, which will form a coating film which will withstand repeated scrubbing or washing, and which will substantially decrease the amount of noxious fumes generated during pyrolysis of the treated wood substrate.

EXAMPLE 1 N,N dimeth vlol bis chloroethylphosonoramidate. Thirteen hundred and forty six grams 4.99 moles of tris chloroethyl phosphite were charged to a three liter flask equipped with a stirrer and a gas delivery tube. This reactant was cooled with. an ice bath to a temperature of less than 20 degrees centigrade and the addition of chlorine to the tris chloroethyl phosphite was commenced. The rate of chlorine addition was maintained so that the temperature of the reaction mixture did not rise above 25 degrees centigrade, chlorine was added to the reaction mixture over a period of 240 minutes until the chlorination reaction was complete as was indicated by the reaction mixture turning to a yellow color . Dichloroethane by product was removed from the reaction mixture by reduced pressure distillation.The reaction mixture was then maintained at ambient temperature and allowed to stand overnight. Ammonia was added to the reaction mixture over a period of about 210 minutes during the atrmonia addition, chloroform was added to maintain the reaction mixture in a fluid state, and the reaction mixture was cooled so that the temperature of the reaction mixture did not exceed about 30 degrees centigrade. The reaction was continued until the ammonia had replaced all of the chlorine which was bonded directly to rne phosphorus atom the reattion was conducted over a period of 210 minutes. as washed with water and filtered. A white solid with a melting point of 68 degrees centigrade was obtained it contained 21.69 percent carbon, 4.66 percent hydrogen, 30.6 percent chlorine, 6.05 percent nitrogen, and 13.57 percent phosphorus. N,N dimethylol bis chloroethyl phosphoramidate was prepared by dissolving bis chloroethyl phosphoramidate in a 37 percent aqueous solution of formaldehyde about 2.1 moles of formaldehyde per mole of phosphoramidate were present in the reaction mixture. The pH of the reaction mixture was maintained at about 10 during the addition of the formaldehyde to the phosphoramidate after these reactants formed a solution, however, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to about 7 via the addition of dilute hydrochloric acid to the reaction mixture.

EXAMPLE 3 Fifty parts of an 80 percent aqueous solution cf AerotexResin M 3 , a methylated trimethylol melamine compound available from the American Cyanamide Corporation, were mixed with 25 parts of a 60 percent aqueous solution of N,N dimethylol bis chloro ethyl phosphoramidate and 25 parts of a 6G percent aqueous solution of 2,2 bis bromomethyl 3 hydroxy 1 propyl phosphoric acid the former compound was prepared in substantial accordance with the procedure described in Example 1, and the latter compound was prepared in substantial accordance with the procedure described in Example 2. Two coats of this formulation were brushed onto a lauan plywood sample which was 24.0 long, 3.5 wide, and 0.1875 thick to a dry solids add on of 8 grams per square foot. Tb coated sample was then dried at a temperature of about 100 degrees centigrade for about 5 minutes. Thereafter the sample was subjected to a two foot tunnel test to determine the flame spread rate this test was conducted in substantial accordance with the procedure described in an article entitled Two Foot Tunnel Test , Journal of Paint Technology, Vol. 11, No. 565,February 1972, pp 43 47 however the panels were not aged as described in this article. The two foot tunnel test is similar to the UL Steiner 25 foot tunnel test described by ASTP1 E84 68. In the formes test, the two foot tunnel was inclined 28 degrees from the horizontal and utilized approximately 96 scuare inches of test surface. The test specimen was mounted on an eagle iron frame in such a way that the surface to be evaluated formed the ceiling of the tunnel.A standard Meeker burner was placed at the lower end of the tun nel and the specimen was subjected to the flame from this burner for five minces during the first four minutes, the length of the advance of the flame front up the inclined panel was recorded at 15 second intervals. The flame lengths were measured by observing the flame front advance through a calibrated window located on the side of the tunnel. The tunnel was calibrated prior to specimen testing by determining the difference in flame lengths of a specimen of asbestos cement board and a specimen of red oak this difference, by introduction of a constant K, was given a flame spread rating FSR of 100.The flame spread rate calculation was made in accordance with the formula F.S.R. Ln La K wherein F.S.R. was the flame spread rating, Ln was the observed flame of the specimen tested, La was the flame for asbestos cement board2 L was the observed flame length for the 0 100 red oak sample, and K Lo La . The samples were weighed both before and after being tested in the two foot tunnel, and the percent weight loss due to combustion of the sample was determined. The coated plywcod sample of this example had a flame spread rating of 20 and lost about 6 percent of its weight after the two foot tunnel test. The coating intumesced during the test and protected the wood surface. A control experiment was conducted wherein the lauan plywood sample which was subjected to the two foot tunnel test was not coated with the intumescent composition of this invention. The uncoated plywood sample had a flame spread rating of 95 and lost about 18 percent of its weight after the two foot tunnel test.
