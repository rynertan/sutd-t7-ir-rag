# Shipping container for storing materials at cryogenic temperatures.

## Abstract
A container 10 for shipping transportable materials at cryogenic temperatures including a vessel which opens to the atmosphere and contains a micro fibrous structure for holding a liquefied gas such as liquid nitrogen in adsorption and capillary suspension. The micro fibrous structure struc ture 27 comprises a core 28 permeable to liquid and gaseous nitrogen and an adsorption matrix 30 composed of randomly oriented inorganic fibers surrounding the core as a homogeneous body in stable confinement.
