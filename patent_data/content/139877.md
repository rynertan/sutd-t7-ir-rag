# CONTAINER AND LID

## Abstract
A one piece tightly fitting, molded plastic lid intended to be used in association with a container having a laterally protruding lip extendng about the perimeter of its mouth. In each embodiment of the invention the plastic lid is provided with a surrounding depending sidewall having a relatively thin upper web segment which is adapted to deform heightwise to conform to the shape of the protruding container lip as the lid is fitted onto the container. The lower region of the lid sidewall has a resilient skirt which is thicker than the web segment and thus has a greater elastic memory. The sidewall skirt stretches when forced over the protruding lip and then the skirt retracts radially inwardly closely adjacent to the outside wall of the container immedi ately below the lip to stretch the deformable web segment tightly over the lip to seal the mouth of the container. One aspect of the invention relates to the container which is formed with an integral, outwardly projecting lip about the rim. The cross section of the lip is contoured to provide a smoothly curving surface of enlarged diameter about which the deformable web of the lid sidewall can be wrapped. In another, modified form of the invention, the container rim is provided with an additional, inwardly projecting lip which cooperates with a sealing ring on the lid in a manner which enhances the seal. This latter configura tion additionally provides enhanced hoop strength for the container itself as well as for the combined container and lid. In one embodiment of the invention the lid sidewall is smooth and shoulderless on its interior surface to facilitate the fit of the sidewall over the lip of the container. One lid may be used with a variety of container lips having different sizes, shapes and compositions. In another embodiment of the invention the lid sidewall is provided with a shoulder on its interior surface which, when the lid is in place, will be disposed below the lip and may engage the underside of the lip to provide an additional inter lock between the lid and container. In this embodiment, which preferably is used in connection with the container having an additional inwardly projecting lip, the lid is provided with a sealing ring which engages the inwardly projecting lip of the container in a manner which tends to bias the lid upwardly. The upward bias tends to draw the shoulder on the lid sidewall snugly against the underside of the container outer lip. This configuration provides additional hoop strength for the assembled lid and container as well as providing a superior seal and safety configuration. In a modification of the invention the lid is provided with a self contained compressible gasket which, when the lid is seated on the container, effects an additional which further supplements the integrity of the seal and assures hermetic characteristics.
