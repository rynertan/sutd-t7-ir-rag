The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by a number of processes, as described in the following wherein Ar, Q, Ra, Rb, R1, R2, R3, R4, m and n are as defined for general formula I unless otherwise specified. In the general processes described below the final step in the reaction may be the removal of e protecting group. According to one general process 1 , 8 compound of general formula I may be obtained by reaction of an amine of general formula II EMI8.1 wherein Y is a hydrogen atom or a qrouo convertible thereto by catalytic hydrogenation with a compound of formula EMI8.2 orEMI8.3 wherein L represents 8 leaving group, for example a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine or iodine, or a hydrocarbylsulphonyloxy group such as methanesulphonyloxy or p toluenesulphonyloxy followed by removal of any protecting groups where present, as described hereinafter. The reaction may be effected in the presence of a suitable solvent for example an alcohol, such as ethanol, a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. chloroform, a substituted amide e.g. dimethylformamide or an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dio xan at a temperature from ambient to the reflux, optionally in the presence of a base such as an organic amine e.g. disopropylethylamine or an inorganic base such as sodium carbonate. Suitable Y groups convertible into a hydrogen atom include arylmethyl groups such as benzyl, benzhydryl, or a methylbenzyl. Such groups may be removed by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a metal catalyst e.g.palladium on charcoal . In another general process 2 , a compound of general formula I may be prepared by alkylation. Conventional alkylation procedures may be used. Thus, for example, in one process a , a compound of general formula I in which R1 is a hydrogen atom may be prepared by alkylation of an amine of general formula III qNR5R6 III wherein R5 is a hydrogen atom or a protecting group andR6 is a hydrogen atom fol lowed by removal of any protecting group where present. The alkylation a may be effected using an alkylating agent of general formula IV EMI9.1 wherein L is as previously defined . The alkylation is preferably effected in the presence of 8 suitable acid scavenger, for example, inorganic bases such as sodium or potassium carbonate, organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or pyridine, or sikylene oxides such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide.The reaction is conveniently effected in 8 solvent such as acetonitrile or sn ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxan, a ketone e.g. butanone or methyl isobutyl ketone, a substituted aside e.g. dimethylformamide or a chlorinated hydrocarbon e.g. chloroform at a temperature between ambient and the reflux temperature of the solvent. According to another example b of an alkylation process, a compound of general formula I in which R1 represents 8 hydrogen atom may be prepared by alkylation of an amine of general formula III , as previously defined except that R6 is a hydrogen atom or 8 group convertible thereto under the reaction conditions, with a compound of general formula V RêCO CH2 mO CH2 nAr V in the presence of 2 reducing agent, followed when necessary by removal of any protecting groups. Suitable reducing agents include hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst such as platinum, platinum oxide, palladium, Raney nickel or rhodium, on a support such as charcoal, using an alcohol, e.g. ethanol or an ester e.g. ethyl acetate or an ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran, or water, as reaction solvent, or a mixture of solvents, e.g. a mixture of two or more of those just described at normal or elevated temperatute and pressure, for example from 20 to 1000C and from 1 go 10 atmospheres. Alternativeiy when one or both of R5 and R6 are hydrogen atoms, the reducing agent maX be a hydride such as diborsne or a metal hydride such as sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or lithium aluminium hydride. Suitable solvents for the ruction with these reducing agents will depend on the particular hydride used, but will include alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, or ethers such as diethyl ether or tert butyl methyl ether, or tetrahydrofuran. Where it is desired to use a protected intermediate of general formula III it is particularly convenient to use hydrogen and a metal catalyst as described above with protecting groups R5 and R6 which are capable of being converted to a hydrogen atom under these reducing conditions. Suitable protecting groups of this type include arylmethyl groups such as benzyl, benzhydryl and a methylbenzyl. In 8 third general process 3 , a compound of general formula I may be prepared by reduction. Thus, in one example Q compound of general formula I may be prepared by reducing sn intermediate ketone of formulae VIa or VIb EMI11.1 therein R5 is as defined for general formula III followed where necessary by removal of any protecting groups. The reduction may be effected using reducing agents conventionally employed for the reduction of ketones, for example hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst.Alternatively the reducing agent may be for example a hydride such as diborane or a metal hydride such as lithium aluminium hydride, sodium bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminium hydride, sodium borohydride or aluminium hydride. The reaction may be effected in a solvent, where appropriate sn alcohol e.g. methanol or ethanol, or an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane. In another process, a compound of general formula I wherein R4 is CH CH3 say be prepared by reaction of an aldehyde of general formula VII EMI12.1 wherein R5 is as previously defined and R7 is a hydrogen atom cm 6 protecting group with a Grignard reagent such as methyl magnesium chloride in 8 solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, followed when necessary by removal of any protecting groups. Suitable protecting groups R7 are tetrahydropyranyl or aralkyl groups such as benzyl, alpha methylbenzyl, diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl.WhenR7 is 8 tetrahydropyranyl group this may be cleaved by hydrolysis under acidic conditions. When R is an aralkyl group te s mey be cleaved by hydrogenolysis as previously described for the groups R5 and R6. s also possible to prepare a compound of general formula I by a process comprising interconversion of another ompound of general formula I . In ne example, a compound of formula fI in whichRa is the group EMI12.2 may bt prepared by reduction of a corresponding compound in which Ra is the group EMI13.1 using for example hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst. In the general processes described above, the compound of formula I obtained may be in the form of a salt, conveniently in the form of e physiologically acceptable salt. Where desired, such salts may be converted to the corresponding free bases using conventional methods. Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds of general formula I may be prepared by reacting a compound of general formula I with an appropriate acid or base in the presence of a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile, acetone, chloroform, ethyl acetate or an alcohol, e.g.methanol, ethanol oriso popanoi Physiologicall y acceptable salts may also be prepared from other salts, including other physiologically acceptable salts, of the compounds of general formula I , using conventional methods. When a specific enantiomer of a compound of general formula I is required, this may be obtained by resolution of a corresponding racemate of a compound of general formula I using conventional methods. Thus, in one example an appropriate optically active acid may be used to form salts with the racemate of a compound of general formula I . The resulting mixture of isomeric salts may be separated for example by fractional crystallisation, into the diastereoisomeric salts from which the required enantiomer of a compound of general formula I may be isolated by conversion into the required free base. Alternativelyt enantiomers of a compound of general formula I may be synthesised from the appropriate optionally active intermediates using any of the general processes described herein. Specific diaate reoisomers of a compound of formula I may be obtained by conventional methods, for example by synthesis from sn appropriate asymmetric starting material using any bf the processes described herein, or by conversion of 8 mixture of isomers of a compound of general formula I into appropriate diastereoisomeric derivatives e.g. salts which then can be separated by conventional means e.g. by fractional crystallisation.Alternatively, in some instances a specific diastereoisomer may be obtained through the use of particular process conditions, for example the diastereoisomers obtained from ketones of formula VIa where R3 is an alkyl group may be determined by the method of reduction chosen. Racemates of diastereoisomers may be obtained by conventional methods of separstion e.g. fractional crystallisation of a mixture of isomers of compounds of formula I or the salts thereof. The intermediate compounds of formula RaCHCHR3L and OHRbCHCH2L may be prepared from the corresponding OH haloketones R8CssSHR3Hal and RbCQCH2Hal hy reduction usi ng for example a metal hydride such as sodium borohydride in a solvent such as ethanol. The halogen atom may be displaced to yield intermediates where L is a leaving group other than a halogen atom.Compounds of formulaEMI14.1 andEMI14.2 may be prepared from the corresponding compoundsEMI14.3 andEMI14.4 by treatment with base, for example an amine, which may be for example a compound of general formula II , or an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide in a solvent such as ethanol. Intermediates of formula III and intermediate ketones of formulae RaCQCHR3Hal and RbCOCH2Hal are either known compounds or may be prepared by analogous methods to those used for the preparation of the known compounds. Intermediate ketones of formulae VIa and VIb may be prepared from ketones of formulae RaCOCHR3Hal endRbCOCH2Hal by reaction with an amine of formula IT . The reaction may be effected in a cold or hot solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran, tert butyl methyl ether, dioxan, chloroform, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile or a ketone such as butanone or methylisobutylketone, or an ester, for example ethyl acetate optionally in the presence of a base such as diisopropylethylamine, sodium carbonate or other acid scavenger such as propylene oxide. Intermediate aldehydes of formula VII may be prepared by oxidation of an alcohol of formula VIII EMI15.1 using an oxidising agent such as activated manganese dioxide in a solvent such as dichloromethane.

The stimulant action at 2 adrenoreceptors of Compounds of the invention was determined using the following GUINEA PIG TRACHEAL STRIP PREPARATIONTracheal rings were mounted in a superfusion apparatus, and continuously superfused with oxygenated physiological Kreb s solution containing indomethacin 2.4x1O6M and atropine 4x10 7M at 370 at a rate of 2ml min. Changes in tension of the preparation were measured using an isometric strain gauge. Preparations were contracted for the duration of the test by the inclusion of prostaglandin F2a 2.9x10 6M in the superfusion fluid.Two bolus dose effect curves to the standard, isoprenaline, 1x10 12 1x10 9 moles were obtained at the start of each test in a cumulative fashion, allowing the relaxation obtained with each to reach its own maximum before the next increment was made. On completion of this dose effect curve, sufficient time was allowed for the tissue to recover 15 30min . After this time, sequential concentration effect curves were constructed for first isoprenaline and then the test compound.These were constructed as follows a low concentration isoprenaline 3x10 10M test compound 1x10 10M was infused until any response obtained had reached its maximum, then the infusion was stopped and the tissue allowed to recover for a maximum of 30min. After this period the procedure was repeated using progressively increasing concentrations of agonist, and in this way, whole concentration effect curves obtained. Potency was determined by comparison of the concentrationeffect curve thus constructed with that previously obtained for isoprenaline and expressed as equipotent concentration isoprenaline 1 i.e. EC50 test compound was calculated. EC50 isoprenalineDuration of action was also measured for each response, and is the time taken from stopping the infusion to 50 recovery. Graphs were drawn for duration times against response magnitude, and from these, duration times for 50 maximum responses were determined. The following potencies expressed as equipotent concen tration, isoprenaline 1 were determined using the guinea pig tracheal test described above Compound of Example No. Potency Isoprenaline 1 5 0.17 6 0.16 8 0.4 12 0.15 14 0.13 17 0.6In general, the compounds according to tbe invention are non toxic at therapeutically useful doses. Thus for example the compounds of Examples 6,7,8 and 10 produced no adverse effects when administered orally to guinea pigs at a dose of Smg kg.
