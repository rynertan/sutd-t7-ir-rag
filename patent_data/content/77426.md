## Description
A METHOD OF AND KIT OF PARTS FOR MAKING A THREE DIMENSIONAL PLAQUE OR PICTURE The present invention relates to a method of and a kit of parts for making a three dimensional plaque or picture and to the plaque or picture when made by the method. It is known to make a three dimensional plaque or picture hereinafter and in the claims hereof referred to as a picture . by printing a sheet of paper with a required design or picture hereinafter and in the claims hereof referred to as a design . and with selected parts of the design, to diecut the sheet around the printed design and the selected parts of the design so that the portions of the sheet containing the printed design and parts thereof can be pressed out of the sheet, to paste the design on a backing member and to superimpose the selected parts of the design over the corresponding parts of the design pasted on the backing member using spacers to give a three dimensional effect. With this known method the pasting of the design on the backing member is a messy and time consuming operation. Also, since the design and the selected parts thereof are printed on a single sheet of paper a compromise has to be made in the weight and thickness of the sheet chosen because it is desirable that on the one hand the design pasted on the backing member does not stand too proud of the backing member and so detract from the appearance of the finished picture whilst on the other hand the selected parts of the design which are superimposed thereover should have sufficient body to be self supporting and relatively stiff. The present invention has as its object to provide a method of and a kit of parts for making a three dimensional picture which enables the aforesaid objections with the known method to be overcome. The present invention provides a method of forming a three dimensional picture, the method comprising a obtaining a sheet one side of which has a contact adhesive coating thereon covered by a peelable release paper and on the other side of which is printed with a required design and with at least one selected part of the design, the sheet and the realease paper being diecut around the design and the said at least one selected part of the design to enable removal of those portions having the design and said at least one selected part thereon, b removing the portion having the design thereon, peeling the release paper from said one side of the portion and adhesively securing the portion of the sheet with the design thereon on a backing member by means of the contact adhesive coating, c removing the at least one portion having a said selected part of the design thereon, and d superimposing the at least one portion over the corresponding part of the design with the interposition of spacers to give a three dimensional effect, the release paper being left in position on said at least one portion whereby to impart additional body thereto. The present invention also provides a three dimensional picture when made by the method of the present invention. The present invention further provides a kit of parts for making a three dimensional picture, the kit of parts comprising a a sheet one side of which has a contact adhesive coating thereon covered by a peelable release paper and the other side of which is printed with a required design and with at least one selected part of the design, the sheet and the release paper being diecut around the design and the said at least one selected part of the design to enable removal of those portions having the design and said at least one selected part thereon, b a backing member, and c spacer pads having on opposite surfaces thereof a contact adhesive covered by a peelable release paper. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the method comprises superimposing over the design secured on the backing member at least one portion having a fisrt selected part of the design and then superimposing over the at least one portion a further portion or portions having further selected parts of the sign thereon, again with the interposition of spacers, so as to enhance the threedimensional effect. The spacers used in the method and kit of parts of the present invention preferably comprise pads of foamed plastics material having on opposite surfaces thereof a contact adhesive covered by a peelable release paper. Advantageously the design, or said first corresponding part or parts of thedesign, may have markings thereon to indicate the positions at which said self adhesive spacer pads are to be located. The backing member may be of any suitable kind and of any suitable material which will provide an attractive background for the design, e.g., may be a sheet of paper, cardboard or the like, a sheet of glass or plastics material, or a ceramic or other tile. Whatever form the backing member takes it may incorporate a stand or other suitable means which will enable it to be stood up on a table or other horizontal surface or may have means such as a loop, ring, hook or the like which will enable the three dimensional picture to be hung on a wall or other vertical surface. The invention will be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates a printed and diecut sheet, Figure 2 illustrates a backing member in the form of a ceramic tile and Figures 3 and 4 are plan and side views respectively of a strip of self adhesive spacer pads. Referring to Figure 1 it will be seen that there is illustrated therein a sheet 1 one surface not shown of which has a contact adhesive coating thereon covered by a peelable release paper and the other, visible, surface of which has printed therein a required design which in this case is in two parts 2a, 2b. Also printed on the sheet 1 are first selected parts 3a, 3b of the required design together with further selected parts 4a, 4b and 4c. The sheet 1 and the release paper on the reverse side thereof is diecut around each of the parts 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b 4a, 4b and 4c so that the portions on which each of these parts is printed can readily be removed. In the illustrated embodiment the required design is to be built up upon a backing member in the form of a round ceramic tile 5 which is illustrated in Fig tire 2 and which is on a slightly smaller scale than the sheet illustrated inFigure 1. The required design is built up on the tile 5 using selfadhesive foamed plastics spacer pads a strip 6 of which is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. The strip 6 comprises a strip of foamed plastics material 7 the opposed major surfaces of which are coated with a contact adhesive 8 covered by strips of release paper 9 and 10. The foamed plastics material 7 and one release paper 9 are diecut as shown at 11 to form a plurality of narrow strip like spacer pads 1 .. To form the required three dimensional design on the ceramic tile 5 the portions of the sheet 1 having the parts of the design 2a, 2b thereon are removed from the sheet 1, the release paper is peeled from the reverse side thereof and the parts 2a, 2b are positioned on the tile 5 and adhesively secured thereto by means of the said contact adhesive coating. The required number of spacer pads 12 are then removed from the release paper 10 and are adhesively secured to the parts of the design 2a, 2b at the locations indicated by the line markings 13 using the contact adhesive 8 on one side of the pads 12. Next the first selected parts 3a, 3b of the design are removed and are superimposed over the corresponding parts ciftthe design 2a, 2b using the contact adhesive 8 on the other side of the spacer pads 12.Further spacer pads 12 are then positioned on the first part 3a at the positions indicated by the line markings 14 and the further parts 4a, 4b and 4c are then removed and superimposed over the corresponding parts of the first part 3a again using the contact adhesive 8 on the spacer pads 12. In this way a design is built up on the tile 5 which gives a threedimensional effect. When securing the selected parts 3a, 3b and the further selected parts 4a, 4b and 4c in superimposed relationship as hereinbefore described, the peelable release paper is left in position on the reverse side thereof so as to impart desirable body and stiffness to these parts. At the same time, removing the peelable release paper from the reverse side of the portions haviEprinted thereon the design 2a, 2b and using the conta adhesive thereon to secure these portions on the tile 5 not only avoids the use of messy paste or the like but also ensures that the portions having the parts 2a, 2b printed thereon do not stand too proud of the surface of the tile 5 and so detract from the appearance of the finished three dimensional picture. To enable the finished picture to be hung on a wall or other suitable surface the tile 5 has secured thereto aD shaped metal ring 15, the ring 15 being secured to the tile 5 by means of a loop 16 of textile or other suitable material which is adhesively secured to the reverse side of the tile 5. It has been found that a design built up in three layers 2, 3 and 4 as described above gives a pleasing threedimensional effect. It will be understood, however, that if desired the design could be made up of two layers only or that if desired a fourth or even more layers could be added.
