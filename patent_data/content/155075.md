# Precision control frequency synthesizer having an unstable, variable frequency input signal.

## Abstract
The subject invention is a precision controlled frequency synthesizer which is capable of precisely adjusting the fre quency of an output signal to maintain a desired frequency difference between an input and output signal regardless of the stability of the frequency of an input signal. The synthesizer comprises the basic elements of a phase locked loop PLL type circuit. The PLL circuit portion detects the actual frequency difference, a value A, between the input and output signals. One reference source provides a desired frequency difference, a value D, which represents the frequency difference between a stable input frequency and a desired output frequency. The difference between the frequency difference values A and D serves as the amount of adjustment to the frequency of the output signal. This adjustment represents the amount of compensation necessary to maintain a specified frequency relationship between the input and output signals.
