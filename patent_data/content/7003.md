# Data processing apparatus including address translation apparatus.

## Abstract
Address translation apparatus is provided for translating virtual addresses to real storage addresses and real storage addresses to virtual storage addresses. The address transla tion apparatus uses a page directory having a next real address and an associated virtual address ordered according to real addresses. This simplifies the manner in which the input output I O handles addressing in a virtual storage computer system. When the I O device control mechanism needs to resolve the real I O address register, it uses the contents of that register to index into the page directory to obtain a corresponding virtual address. The corresponding virtual address is incremented and converted to a real address which is used to index into the page directory. The virtual address taken from the page directory is then compared with the virtual address which had been incremented and trans lated. If the two compare then the real address which had been used to access the page directory is entered into a regis ter so as to be available as a real main storage address. In actuality it is only a partial real main storage address and is concatenated with a byte identifier portion of the main stor age address wliich requires no translation and which was a part of the original I O real address for main storage.
