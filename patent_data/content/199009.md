# PATH COVERAGE MEASURING SYSTEM IN A PROGRAMME

## Abstract
A system of the invention has a compiler 12 for converting a conditional branch instruction, located in a source program being converted into an object program, into a conditional branch instruction having a flag field 23 in which data is set representing whether a branch has been made. A load module generated from the object program 13 through a linker 14 is stored in a main memory. An instruction fetched from the main memory is decoded by an instruction decoder 31 . A branch condition determination section 32 determines if the instruction is branch or through and changes the flag field data. The program, now including a conditional branch instruction with the changed data, is rewritten into the load module.
