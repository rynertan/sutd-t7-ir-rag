# Curling iron.

## Abstract
A curling iron 10 has a tubular body 14 with bristles 46 and a handle 12 . The bristles 46 are fixed in four bars 44 within the body 14 and extend outward for reciprocat ing movement through wall openings 42 . Four actuator pins 36,38 fixed to each of two supports 50,52 extend at an angle Î± to slidably engage the bars 44 and move them radially when the supports 50,52 are moved together longitudinally by a slidably mounted tie rod 58 . Four guide pins 48 fixed to the body 14 restrain longitudinal move ment of the bars 44 . An external manually operable sleeve 54 on the body 14 engages one support 52 for moving the supports 50,52 for retraction of the bristles 46 , and a spring 100 biases the support 52 for automatic return to a position with the bristles 46 extended.
