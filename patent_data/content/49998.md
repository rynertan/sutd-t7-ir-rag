# Method of regenerating ion exchange resin material of mixed functionality.

## Abstract
Ion exchange resins of mixed functionality, either mixed bed anion and cation exchangers or amphoteric resins, are regenerated without separation by successive treatment with first and second regenerants, the second regenerant specifically being an emulsion ion exchange resin in an ionic form capable of regenerating the functional groups in the original mixed resin that were not regenerated by the first regenerant.
