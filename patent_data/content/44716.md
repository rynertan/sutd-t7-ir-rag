# Ceramic fibre composite and method of making it.

## Abstract
A method of making a ceramic fibre composite, by providing a liquid stream of a molten alumino silicate ceramic material and projecting a stream of gas at the liquid stream whereby the ceramic material is fiberized, is character ized by entraining particles of a refractory oxide, particularly alumina, in the gas stream so that the particles become firmly attached to the fibres. The ceramic fibre composites may have a composition of about 72 Al₂O₃ and 28 SiO₂ by weight, have reduced tendency to shrink or devitrify on firing, and are environmentally advantageous.

## Description
CERAMIC FIBRE COMPOSITE AND METHOD OF MAKING IT. Ceramic alumino silicate fibres have prove themselves to be an efflcient refractory material for lining many types of industrial furnaces. Their many advantages such as low conductivity, resistance to chemical attack and lightness are well known. However, these fibres have various disadvantages.They are capable of withstanding in continuous use temperatures of up to only about 1260 C their infra red radiation reflecting properties are not ideal they shrink on reaching temperatures above 75ooh giving rise to engineering difficulties in their application and on being heated to higher temperaturcs change to crystalline forms of silica such as crystobalite and tridymite which can be injurious if inhaled, and against which elaborate precautions must be taken in the interest of health. It has long been known that the presence of free alumina within the mass of fibre is conducive to the formation of a harmless crystalline phase known as mullite rather than those of crystobalite or tridymite.Another consequence of the formation of mullite is that it results in growth rather than shrinkage on heating. Mullite has the formula 3A1203.2SiO2 and a composition of 72X A1203 and 285 SiO by weight. Ceramic fibres generally contain 40 to 65 by weight of each of alumina and silica. The conventional method of manufacture involves pouring a liquid stream of the desired chemical composition through a blast of gas which comminutes the stream and fiberizes the droplets. However, when the droplets contain more than about 65X by weight alumina, the melt becomes too viscous, so it is not possible by conventional methods to make ceramic alumino silicate fibres containing as much as 72 by weight alumina. Another approach which has been tried is to incorporate with the preformed ceramic fibres an amount of alumina such that mullite will tend to be formed, in preference to crystobalite or tridymite, at high temperatures. The amount necessary for this purpose is readily deteimined. For example, alumina in the form of a sol or in coarser forms can be washed into or mixed with fibres. However, these processes have disadvantages. The contact between the alumina and the fibres is not intimate and is uneven and uncertain. Further washing may remove the alumina. In addition certain sols or washes such as Boehmite, as well as introducing insufficient alumina, interfere with further processing of the fibre mass because of their gelatinous nature. It is an object of this invention to avoid these disadvantages. However, the invention is not limited to additions of alumina. In its broadest aspect, the invention provides a ceramic fibre composite comprising ceramic alumino silicate fibres, and firmly adhering thereto, a coating or discrete particles of a refractory oxide. This invention envisages ceramic fibre products made by any process for example, the blowing process in which a stream of molten alumino silicate material is fibrized by a blast of gas or the spinning disc process in which a stream of the molten material impinges on a spinning disc provided that the refractory oxide is firmly bonded to the fibres. It is thought that bonding occurs as a result of contact between the oxide particles and the fibres as the latter are solidifying or about to solidify. As indicated above, one refractory oxide envisaged accprding to the invention is alumina. Others are titanium dioxide, zirconium dioxide and chromic oxide, which may be used in amounts of up to 25 , preferably from 1 to 10 , by weight on the weight of the fibre composite. Itis known that these three oxides can enable alumino silicate ceramic fibres to withstand higher temperatures. In addition, titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide can improve their infra red radiation reflecting properties. Other refractory oxides may be used to provide these or other advantages. At least the majority, and preferably all, the refractory oxide is firmly attached to the ceramic fibres and may form a coating round the fibres or be in the form of discrete particles partly or completely embedded in the fibres. Alumina, when used, is preferably present in an amount such that the overall composition of the composite is appropriate for the formation of mullite at high temperatures that is to say comprises alumina and silica in a weight ratio of 2 1 to 4 1, particularly about 2.57 1.On conventional alumino silicate ceramic fibres averaging 3 microns in diameter, a continuous alumina coating about half a micron thick would provide a composite of overall composition appropriate for forming mullite. In another aspect, the invention provides a method of making a ceramic fibre composite by providing a liquid stream of a molten alumino silicate ceramic material and projecting a stre of gas at the liquid stream whereby the ceramic material is converted into fibres1 characterised in that particles of a refractory oxide are entrained in the gas stream so that the said particles become firmly attached to the fibres. Ceramic fibres typically have diameters of a few microns. The particles of the refractory oxide may have diameters of up to 50 microns, but are preferably of submicron size. For example, colloidal alumina from an aqueous sol may suitably be used. The oxide particles entrained in the gas stream contact the ceramic droplets as they are cooled and fiberized and are beleived to become embedded in the fibres or sintered to the surface thereof, either as discrete particles or in the form of a partial or complete coating. Those particles that are so attached to the fibres cannot be removed by washing or by the normal mechanical treatments to which ceramic fibres are generally subjected. Moreover the very intimate contact between fibres and alumina greatly reduces the risk of forming undesirable forms of silica on firing. The refractory oxide may be entrained in the stream of gas by conventional means. For example a concentrated sol of alumina or other refractory oxide may be entrained in the stream of gas by means of a venturi. The rate of flow of the liquid stream of molten alumino silicate ceramic material, the rate of flow of the stream of gas, and the other variables of the fiberizing process may be convention al. Only some of the refractory oxide particles in the gas stream become attached to the fibres, and it is therefore necessary to entrain an excess of the refractory oxide particles in the gas stream the surplus may be recovered for re use. When ceramic fibre composites, containing refractory oxides in addition to alumino silicate fibre, are fired, chemical reactions take place and modify the properties of the fibre. For example, titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide react with alumina to form aluminates excess alumina retards devitrification and encourages the formation of crystalline mullite. When refractory oxides have been physically mixed with ceramic fibres2 e.g. in a slurry, it is typically necessary to fire the resulting composites for from 50 to 200 hours to effect the desired reactions.By contrast, ceramic fibre composites of the present invention can, by virtue of the intimate contact between fibre and refractory oxide, be fired for less than 10 hours, e.g. 3 to 4 hours in order to effect the desired reactions. The accompanying drawing is a scanning electron micrograph at 2000 x magnification of an alumino silicate ceramic fibre 10 about 10 microns in diameter. The part of the fibre in the upper half of the picture is covered with a uniform coating 12 about 1 micron thick of alumina.The part of the fibre in the lower half of the picture has, firmly adhering thereto, discrete particles 14 of alumina a few microns in diameter. The following Examples illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 1 3 kg of a mixture of 45 by weight of alumina and 55 by weight of silica sand was melted in an induction furnace and the molten liquid caused to flow through a hole 8 mm in diameter. A stream of compressed air was blown at 1 MPa through a 3 mm nozzle at the stream of liquid. Entrained in the stream of air at a rate of 100 ccs, per minute was a 30 solids aqueous sol of sub micrcn alumina particles. The resulting fibre had good tensile strength and good texture. The fibres had two types of coating, namely a covering of fine particles less than 2 microns along much of the fibre length, and a number of globules attached firmly to the fibres at infrequent points along their length. Microanalvsis confirmed that these globules up to 40 microns were alumina. EXAMPLE 2 Conditions were as in Example 1, except that a 40 solids aqueous sol of sub micron alumina particles was entrained in the stream of air at a rate of 80 ccs per minute. The resulting fibre was somewhat brittle. A thick friable coating covered the surface of the fibres. Some larger globules were also present in this coating. Figure 1 is a scanning electron micrograph of a fibre produced in this experiment. The aqueous sols used in Examples 1 and 2 were prepared from a commercially available white free flowing powder containing 65 alumina of particle size typically 0.1 micron 2 and surface area 250 300 m g, together with 35 water. This powder is easily dispersable in water to give an aqueous sol of pH 4 4.5.
