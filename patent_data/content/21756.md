# Selective adsorption process and system.

## Abstract
There is provided an improved selective adsorption process for the recovery of a light gas, especially hydrogen, from a feed gas mixture by utilizing a membrane permeator unit 16 selectively permeable to said light gas to recover a more concentrated light gas from a stream comprising said light gas used to regenerate a selective adsorber unit 3 and recycling the concentrated light gas to the selective adsorber unit, either blended with the feed gas mixture or as purging gas, for recovery of an added proportion of highly purified light gas product, and the system of apparatus for effecting the improved selective adsorption process.
