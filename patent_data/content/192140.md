## Description
The invention relates to a method for air conditioning by means of an air conditioner comprising the features of the first part of claim 1 which are known for example from US A 4,347,712. The known air conditioner does not comprise a heat load measuring device. It is known in an air conditioner to make use of a room thermostat to detect the actual room temperature, to compare the detected temperature with a set temperature and upon the result of such comparison to influence air quantity data in a sense to reduce the determined temperature difference as shown for example in US 4,406,397. A central air conditioning system of a type which carries out air conditioning by distribution of temperature regulated air to every room through air ducts possesses various meritorious effects in comparison with the conventional heat pump chiller fan coil system, the package air conditioners decentralized arrangement system, and others in that it can easily incorporate therein various facilities like a humidifier, a high performance air filter for cleaning external air introduced into the system, and a total heat exchanger, hence it is able to perform a high grade air conditioning operation, it has the least disorder in its heat transporting system, and yet it can utilize the room space with high effectiveness because the room to be air conditioned has only an outlet port for the conditioned air, and an inlet port for the exterior air to be introduced into the room. Therefore, such centralized air conditioning system has so far been used widely for the air conditioning of a large sized building. Of various centralized air conditioning systems, the variable air quantity control system adapted to the energy saving operations hereinafter simply called VAV system is capable of controlling temperature in a plurality of rooms, each having different heat load, independently of the other, is capable of stopping the air conditioning operation in those rooms which are not in use, is also able to reduce the running cost of the air conditioning system by changing the power for the air blower in accordance with quantity of air to be blown out, and, at the same time, is able to decrease the capacity of the heat source apparatus by taking into consideration of the rate of its use. There are two types in the VAV system depending on the construction of the air quantity adjusting damper. The one is a system which uses a bypass type VAV unit damper unit , wherein a ratio between the air quantity to be blown out into the room depending on the heat load of the room and the air quantity to be directly returned or bypassed to the heat source apparatus is adjusted. This type of the VAV system is used in most cases for the air conditioning system utilizing the package air conditioners which are difficult to control the capacity of its heat source apparatus, because of the air blowing quantity being kept constant, but this system has no energy saving effect to be attained by control of the air blower. The other is a type which uses a throttle type VAV unit, wherein the quantity of air to be blown out into the room is adjusted to an arbitrary value in accordance with the heat load of the room. This VAV system is to detect a pressure in the air duct, which varies in conformity with the degree of opening of the damper, and controls the capacity of the air blower in a manner to bring this detected pressure value to a certain determined value. Therefore, when the heat load in the room decreases that is to say, the air quantity becomes reduced, and the temperature of the air within the duct, at this time, is regulated at a constant level , the required performance of the heat source apparatus becomes reduced and the power for the air blower is also decreased. Figure 2 of the accompanying drawing illustrates a schematic construction of an air conditioner to be the basis for explanation of the known art as well as the present invention. In the drawing, a reference numeral 1 designates rooms to be air conditioned in the illustrated case, three rooms are to be air conditioned . A numeral 2 refers to a fan coil unit disposed in the ceiling part of the building, and which is constructed with an air filter 3, a heat exchanger 4 and an air blower 5. A numeral 6 refers to a main duct connected to an air outlet port of the fan coil unit 2 a reference numeral 7 designates three branch ducts diverged from the main duct 6 a reference numeral 8 indicates the throttle type VAV unit placed in one part of each of the branch ducts 7 a reference numeral 9 denotes a damper rotatably fitted within each of the VAV units 8 a numeral 10 refers to an outlet port provided at the end part of the branch duct 7 a numeral 11 refers to an inlet port provided at the lower part of a door for the room 1 a numeral 12 represents an air inlet port formed in the ceiling board above the corridor a reference numeral 13 designates an inlet duct for communicatively connecting the inlet port at the ceiling with the inlet port of the fan coil unit 2 a numeral 14 refers to a room thermostat attached in each of the rooms 1 a numeral 15 denotes a temperature sensor disposed in one part of the main duct 6 a numeral 16 refers to a pressure sensor with its sensing part disposed in one part of the main duct 6 and a numeral 17 refers to a control device fitted on the fan coil unit 2. In the conventional air conditioning apparatus, the degree of opening of the damper 9 is adjusted at an arbitrary position for each room in accordance with a difference between a temperature set by a user in each room through the room thermostat 14 and a temperature of the air currently detected by a temperature sensor. On account of this, the pressure in the main duct 6 changes depending on the degree of opening of the damper 9, the change of which is detected by the pressure sensor 16, thereby varying the capacity of the air blower 5 so as not to bring about an excessive pressure in the main duct. Further, since the temperature of the outlet air from the heat exchanger 4 varies with changes in the air blowing quantity, this temperature is detected by the temperature sensor 15, on the basis of which the temperature or the circulating quantity of the heat medium to the heat exchanger is varied so that the temperature of the air may be kept at a predetermined temperature level. In this connection, it should be understood that the heat exchanger 4 is generally connected with a heat accumulating vessel for cold or hot water, and that the air used for the air conditioning of the room 1 flows out of the inlet port 11, passes through a space such as the corridor, etc., and flows into the inlet port 12 in the ceiling, and further passes through the inlet duct 13 to return to the fan coil unit 2. By the way, the air blower 5 is controlled by the well known methods of the constant static pressure control method or the variable static pressure control method using an air quantity sensor. In the illustrated construction of Figure 2, the air used for the air conditioning of the room is returned by use of a space such as the corridor, etc. Besides this, there may also be contemplated a system, wherein an air return duct is provided between each room 1 and the fan coil unit 2 so as to improve much more its efficiency in the control as well as in the energy saving. Moreover, in the embodiment of Figure 2, the ducts 7 are branched out from the main duct 6, besides which there may also be contemplated a way, in which such branched ducts are provided directly from the fan coil unit 2 in the shape of octopus legs, not by providing the main duct. Additionally, the fan coil unit 2, besides its being placed in the ceiling as shown in Figure 2, may also be hung from the ceiling or set on the floor. Since the conventional air conditioner is constructed as described above, the air conditioning system using the bypass type VAV unit lacks in its energy saving property. Furthermore, in the air conditioning system using the throttle type VAV unit, when a direct expansion type heat pump is used as the heat source apparatus for a small scale air conditioning system intended for residence, small sized shops, etc., there have been encountered such points of problem that, since the number of rooms to be simultaneously air conditioned is small and yet no forced ventilation is done in most cases, the heat load in each room is low, on account of which the heat source apparatus i.e., heat pump is difficult to be controlled at the time of such low heat load with the consequent inability to increase operational reliability of the air conditioning apparatus. The present invention aims at providing an improved air conditioner with increased operational reliability of the heat pump without affecting whatsoever the comfort in the air conditioned room. In order to attain such intended purposes, the method according to the present invention is characterized by the features of claims 1 to 14. The air conditioning apparatus according to the present invention functions in such a manner that the heat load measuring means calculates the heat load in the room on the basis of a difference between a room temperature established by a room thermostat and a current room temperature as detected then the degree of opening of the damper in the branch duct is determined by the damper control quantity determining means based on the heat load as calculated to control the degree of opening of the damper in accordance with this determination thereafter, the pressure and the temperature within the duct after the damper control are detected based on the detection signals of the pressure and the temperature, the operating conditions of the air conditioner are measured by the operating conditions measuring means at the same time, the number of revolution of the air blower is determined by the air blower revolution determining means based on the result of the pressure measurement and the air blower is controlled with the determined number of revolution and Mitsubishi Denki K.K. FB 1880 EU 14823 05.12.90 The compressor capacity determining means determines the capacity of the compressor based on the measured result of the heat load measuring means and the measured result of the temperature by the operating conditions measuring means, based on the results of determination of which it controls the capacity of the compresor. With such functions of the air conditioning system of the present invention, the temperature of the outlet air is determined by the sum of the heat load in all the rooms to be air conditioned, and the capacity of the compressor is controlled in such a manner that the temperature in these rooms may be maintained at a constant level with the consequence that frequent on and off operations of the compressor can be eliminated. By application of a method according to the invention the air conditioning can be smoothly controlled by supervising signals which indicate the temperature difference from a number of rooms. The present invention is described in more detail hereinbelow with reference to the drawings which illustrate a specific embodiment, in which Figure 1 of the accompanying drawing is a schematic diagram showing the principle of constructing the air conditioning apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention. As is apparent from the drawing, the air conditioner of the present invention is constructed with a heat pump 18 as the heat source apparatus, an air blower 5 for sending cool or warm air from the heat pump 18 into each of the rooms 1 through a main duct 6 and branched ducts 7, dampers 9 for regulating the quantity of the air, each of which is disposed at each of the branched ducts 7, a room thermostat 14 provided in each of the rooms 1, and a temperature sensor 15 and a pressure sensor 16 fitted in one part of the main duct 6. An output signal from each of the room thermostats 14 is made to be introduced as an input into a heat load measuring device 19 for measuring magnitude of the heat load in each of the rooms 1. A reference numeral 20 designates a damper control quantity determining device for determining a control quantity of the damper 9 on the basis of the output from the heat load measuring device 19.

A reference numeral 22 denotes an operating conditions measuring device for measuring the operating conditions of the air conditioner based on detection signals of the temperature and the pressure in the main duct 6 after the damper control as detected by the temperature sensor 15 and the pressure sensor 16. A reference numeral 23 represents an air blower revolution determining device for determining the optimum number of revolution of the air blower 5 on the basis of the output pressure signal as measured by the operating conditions measuring device 22, the output from this air blower revolution determining device 23 being forwarded to an air blower control device 24 for controlling the air blower 5. A reference numeral 25 designates a compressor capacity determining device for determining the optimum capacity of the heat pump compressor 18 based on the output temperature signal as measured by the operating conditions measuring device 22, the output from this compressor capacity determining device 25 being forwarded to the compressor capacity control device 26 for controlling the capacity of the heat pump 18. Figure 3 schematically illustrates an overall construction of the above mentioned heat pump 18, which includes a variable capacity type variable revolution type compressor 28, a four way valve 29, a heat exchanger 4 to the inner side of the room, an expansion valve 30 for carrying out flow rate control of a cooling medium by arbitrarily displacing a plunger to an arbitrary by an electromagnet, a heat exchanger 31 to the outer side of the room, and an accumulator 32, all these component elements being connected in a circular form to construct the refrigerating circuit. Incidentally, a reference numeral 33 denotes an outdoor fan belonging to the above mentioned heat exchanger 31 to the outer side of the room. Figures 4A and 4B illustrate in detail the VAV unit 8 which is constructed with a damper motor 34 utilizing a stepping motor to perform its forward and reverse rotations at an arbitrary angle for the oscillatory motion of the damper 9, and a limit switch 35 to detect a position of the damper 9. The limit switch 35 is provided at the full closure position of the damper 9. Figure 5 is a circuit diagram illustrating a concrete example of the present invention corresponding to the basic construction of the air conditioning apparatus shown in Figure 1. In the drawing, a reference numeral 36 designates a micro computer provided in a control device 17, which is constructed with a central processing unit CPU 37, a memory 38 for storing therein results of the arithmetic operations, etc. carried out in a control program and the CPU 37, a timer 39, an input circuit 40, and an output circuit 41. A numeral 42 refers to an analog multiplexer, into which the detection outputs from the room thermostat 14, the temperature sensor 15, and the pressure sensor 16 are introduced as the inputs. A reference numeral 43 denotes an A D converter for converting these outputs into digital signals, the digital output signals of which are forwarded to the input circuit 40. A reference numeral 44 indicates an operating switch, the condition signal from which is forwarded to the input circuit 40 together with the signal from the limit switch 35.

Further, the outdoor fan 33 is connected with the photo coupler SSR 45e, and the four way valve 29 with the photo coupler SSR 45f. A numeral 50 refers to an a.c. and d.c. power source for driving each and every control means. In the following, the operation of the described air conditioner will be explained in reference to the flow charts shown in Figures 6 to 9, wherein Figure 6 is the main flow chart showing the control program as stored in the memory 38 of the micro computer 36 Figure 7 is the sub routine flow chart for the damper control Figure 8 is the sub routine flow chart for the air blower and Figure 9 is the sub routine flow chart for the compressor control. It should be understood that the ensuing explanations on the operations of the air conditioner will be made mainly in connection with the warming mode. First of all, the operating switch 44 is set on the warming or cooling mode in this case the warming mode at the step 50, whereupon an on signal is input into the input circuit 40 and the apparatus starts its operation. By this actuation of the operating switch 44, a control constant required for the warming or cooling operation is supplied from the memory 38 into the CPU 37 steps 51 and 52 . Subsequently, the initial setting of each damper 9 is effected at the step 53. The damper motor 34 continues its rotation until the limit switch 35 is once actuated to bring the damper to its full closure state , after which it sets the damper at the full open position. At this time, an accurate position of the damper 9 is stored in the memory 39. Subsequently, the operational sequence goes into an ordinary control loop, which is repeated henceforward by the timer 39 at a certain definite time interval. Initially, at the step 54, if it is judged that the operational sequence is the timer control, the sequence goes to the step 55 where on or off of the four way valve 29 and the outdoor fan 33 is determined, on the basis of which both the four way valve 29 and the outdoor fan 33 are controlled by the output control signals from the output circuit 41 through the photo couplers SSR 45e and 45f. Subsequently, the operational sequence proceeds to the damper control at the step 56 where the control program as shown in Figure 7 is executed that is to say, the heat load measuring operation is effected at the step 57 in Figure 7, on the basis of which output signal of a room temperature T₀ established by the room thermostat 14 in each room and the current temperature T₁ in each room are introduced into the CPU 37 by way of the analog multiplexer 42, the A D converter 43, and the input circuit 40. Following this, the operational sequence proceeds to the damper control quantity determining operations at the steps 58 to 61. In determining the damper control quantity, the room temperature T₀ and the room temperature T₁ are first compared at the step 58, and, if T₁ is lower than T₀ t , it is determined that the damper 9 be brought to its full open state t denotes a non sensing region both above the below T₀ if T₁ is higher than T₀ t , it is determined that the damper 9 be brought to its full closed state step 62 and if T₁ is within T₀ t , it is determined that the damper 9 has no change in the degree of its opening. This determination of the damper control quantity is executed for all the rooms 1, the determination of which is made at the step 61. The results of the foregoing sequential operations are transmitted to the damper controller 49 from the output circuit 41 by way of the photo coupler SSR 45d by the damper control output operation at the step 62 to thereby open or close the damper 9 in full degree by forward or reverse rotation of the damper motor 34. Then, the sequential operation proceeds to the indoor fan control at the step 63 in Figure 6 where the air flow control program as shown in Figure 8 is executed. In more detail, the operating condition measuring operation is carried out at the step 64, and output signals T₂ and P from the temperature sensor 15 and the pressure sensor 16, respectively, are introduced into the CPU 37 by way of the analog multiplexer 42, the A D converter 43, and the input circuit 40. Subsequently, the operational sequence proceeds to the air blower revolution determining operation at the steps 65 to 71, wherein determination is made at the step 65 as to whether the dampers 9 are all in full closed state, or not if they are all fully closed, the sequential operation goes to the step 66 where the air blower 5 is turned off, and the sequential operation proceeds to the step 72. If it is determined at the step 65 that the dampers 9 are not in full closure, determination is made at the step 67 as to whether the air blower 5 is on or off . At the step 65, if it is determined that the air blower 5 is in its off state, the sequential operation goes to the step 68 where the air blower 5 is turned on, after which the sequence proceeds to the step 69. At the step 69, comparison is made between an established pressure P₀ in the main duct 6 as memorized in the memory 37 and a pressure P which has been detected at the previous step 64. If P₀ is greater than P, the sequence proceeds to the step 70 where the number of revolution of the air blower 5 is increased in accordance with a difference between P₀ and P. On the other hand, if P₀ is smaller than P, the sequence proceeds to the step 71 where the number of revolution of the air blower 5 is decreased in accordance with a difference between P₀ and P. Further, if P is present within the non sensing region of P₀, the operational sequence proceeds to the next step 72 for the air blower control output operation without changing the number of revolution of the air blower 5. The control outputs from the above described operations are forwarded from the CPU 37 to the thyrister controller 47 by way of the output circuit 41 and the photo coupler SSR 44b, where the input signals in a.c. waveforms are controlled by the thyrister to be output to the air blower 5 for arbitrary control of its number of revolution. Thereafter, the sequential operation proceeds to the compressor control at the step 73 as shown in Figure 6 where the compressor capacity determining operation as shown in Figure 9 is executed. In this compressor capacity determining operation, determination is made at the step 74 as to whether the dampers 9 are all in their full closure state, or not. If they are all in the full closure state, the operational sequence proceeds to the step 75 to turn off the compressor 28, and the sequence further proceeds to the step 83. On the other hand, if the dampers are not in their full closure state, the operational sequence goes to the step 76 where determination is made as to whether the compressor 28 is in on or off . If it is off , the operational sequence proceeds to the step 77 where the compressor 28 is turned on, and then the sequence goes to the subsequent step 78. At the step 78, a sum Σ T₀ T₁ of differences between the established room temperature T₀ and the current room temperature T₁ of all the rooms as measured at the previous step 64 except for those rooms not to be air conditioned only those room where T₀ is higher than T₁ is found. The sum corresponds to the total heat load of the entire air conditioning system. On the basis of this sum as found, a value of the outlet air temperature of the heat exchanger 4, i.e., the blow out air temperature T₃ is established at the subsequent step 79. As shown in Figure 10, the value of T₃ is found from an equation of At the subsequent step 80, comparison is made between the established air temperature T₃ as found at the step 79 and the temperature T₂ as detected at the previous step 64. If T From the above described compressor capacity determining operations, the number of revolution of the compressor 28 is so controlled that it may be large when the heat load is high, and that it may be small when the heat load is low. As the consequence of this, the heat pump 18 is operated with its capacity conforming to the heat load in particular, the compressor 28 does not repeat its on off operation frequently at the time of the low heat load. The control outputs from the CPU 37 by the above described operations are forwarded to the inverter 46 from the output circuit 41 by way of the photo coupler SSR 45a, where the frequency and the voltage of the a.c. power source are controlled as an output to the compressor 28 for arbitrary control of the number of its revolution. The capacity of the heat pump 18 varies in accordance with the number of revolution of the compressor 28, whereby temperature of the outlet air from the heat exchanger 4 at the indoor side is controlled. Next, the expansion valve 30 is controlled at the step 84 in accordance with the number of revolution of the compresor 28 and a temperature of the external air, and then a defrost control is further carried out at the step 85, after which the operational sequence returns to the step 54. Thereafter, this loop control operations are repeated. By the way, it should be understood that detailed explanations for the steps 84 and 85 and the safety circuit for the air conditioning system have been dispensed with, since they have no close connection with the subject matter of the present invention. In the above described embodiment, the room temperature is controlled by regulating the degree of opening of the damper 9 in its full open state or in its full closure state. According to this control system, the warm air is sent into the room 1 at its maximum flow rate i.e., at its maximum wind velocity when the damper 9 is in the open state, while its flow rate becomes zero when the damper 9 is in the closure state, with the consequence that the temperature distribution between the upper part and the lower part of the room 1 can be rendered substantially uniform at the time of the warming operation, in particular, hence a confortable dwelling space is secured. Besides this control system, it may also be feasible for the purpose of the present invention to adopt a throttle control system which has been employed in the conventional VAV unit. In that case, the total degree of opening of the damper 9 is set at its minimum for example, when three VAV units are used, the minimum value for the total degree of opening is set at 50 for its open state , so that the air blower 5 and the compressor 28 stop their operations when the degree of opening becomes less than this minimum value. Furthermore, in the above described embodiment, the number of revolution the air blower is controlled by use of the thyrister for the air blower control means 24, although it may be feasible to carry out the control by use of the inverter as is the case with the compressor capacity control means 26. Moreover, in the above described embodiment, the capacity of a single unit of the compressor 28 is made variable by use of the inverter. However, when a plurality of units of compressor are used for expanding a range of the capacity control, wherein the inverter is used for such capacity control, much better capacity control can be effected in correspondence to the heat load, whereby frequency in the on off operations of the compressor 28 can be reduced. Although the above described embodiment uses the heat pump as the heat source apparatus, this control system can also be applied to an air conditioner of a type, wherein an auxiliary heating appliance such as a gas furnace, etc. is incorporated in its fan coil unit. In addition, the above described embodiment is so constructed that the pressure and the temperature of air within the duct are simultaneously detected, and then the operating conditions of the air conditioning apparatus is measured by the operating conditions measuring device, on the basis of which the air blower and the compressor are controlled. It is, however, possible that the pressure alone is first detected to control the air blower, and then the air temperature is detected to control the compressor. As described in the foregoing, the first embodiment of the air conditioning apparatus according to the present invention is so constructed that the outlet air temperature is established in correspondence to the heat load when it is decreased, and the capacity control of the heat pump is effected in accordance with this outlet air temperature, with the consequent effects of the compressor being free from its frequent on off operations at the time of a low heat load, hence improvement in the operating reliability of the compressor.
