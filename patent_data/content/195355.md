## Description
The present invention relates to a refractive index coupling elastic composition for optical communication fiber joints. More specifically, the present invention relates to an organopolysiloxane type refractive index coupling elastic composition for the joints of optical communication fibers joined by the connecting method. Optical communication glass fibers and optical communication plastic fibers optical fibers below may be joined by one of two methods splicing or connecting in which the ends are placed face to face without splicing. Because precision connectors have recently been developed, connecting is preferred and appears to be more workable. A refractive index coupler is generally used in the connecting method. It is filled into the gap at the ends of the optical fibers in order to prevent light transmission loss by reflection. As announced in Report No. 2232 at the 1984 National General Meeting of the Institute of Electronics and Communication Engineers of Japan, silicone oils and silicone oil compounds, in which silicone oil is combined with silica, etc., for thickening, are considered to be appropriate refractive index couplers. However, silicone oils are liquids and thus leak out, which causes a void to appear in the joint. Silicone oil compounds, which represent an improvement on silicone oils, have a grease like consistency and will not leak out. However, air bubbles formed in the grease like compound cannot be removed. In addition, coating the silicone oil compound on the fiber ends requires a very high level technique to avoid the inclusion of air bubbles. Various methods were examined by the present inventor in order to develop a refractive index coupler which would not have the above mentioned disadvantages and the present invention was thus developed as a result. The goal of the present invention is to eliminate the above mentioned disadvantages of the prior art technologies by providing a refractive index coupler which does not leak out or trap air bubbles. The present invention relates to a refractive index coupler elastic composition for optical communication fiber joints comprising A an organopolysiloxane having the average unit formula Component A is the principal component of the elastic composition of the present invention. It is expressed by the average unit formula The molecular configuration of this component may be straight chain, straight chain with branches, or cyclic, but a straight chain, possibly with a small number of branches, is preferred. The preferred straight chained organopolysiloxane is a linear polydiorganosiloxane The molecular weight of this component is unrestricted, but the weight average molecular weight is desirably 1,000 in order to achieve the desired modulus and it is preferably αµρ 100,000 to facilitate operations such as mixing and molding. Examples of this organopolysiloxane are Especially preferred examples of this linear polydiorganosiloxane are a dimethylvinylsiloxy terminated polydiorganosiloxane having dimethylsiloxane units and methylphenylsiloxane units and having a viscosity of 25 C in the range of from 1 to 10 Pa.s. and a dimethylvinylsiloxy terminated polydiorganosiloxane having dimethylsiloxane units and diphenylsiloxane units and having a viscosity at 25 C in the range of from 1 to 10 Pa.s. Component B is a crosslinker for component A and is an organohydrogenpolysiloxane. It addition reacts with component A in the presence of component C to cure component A into an elastic material. For this reason, this component must contain at least two silicon bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule. This component can be expressed by the average unit formula Examples of this organohydrogenpolysiloxane are Component C catalyzes the crosslinking addition reaction of component A and component B . Examples of said platinum catalysts are finely divided platinum, possibly supported on a carrier, platinum black, chloroplatinic acid, sodium chloroplatinate, potassium chloroplatinate, platinum tetrachloride, alcohol modified chloroplatinic acid, chloroplatinic acid olefin complexes, chloroplatinic acid alkenylsiloxane complexes, and diketone chelate compounds of platinum. This component is added at 0.1 to 100 parts by weight as platinum metal per 1,000,000 parts by weight of the combined quantity of components A and B . When this quantity is less than 0.1 part by weight, a satisfactory crosslinking will not occur. It is uneconomical for this quantity to exceed 100 parts by weight. The elastic material of the invention is produced by mixing the three components A , B , and C , possibly in the presence of a curing retarder which can control the crosslinking reaction, and then allowing the mixture to stand at room or elevated temperature. Examples of the above mentioned retarders are triallyl isocyanurate, triazoles, nitrile compounds, acetylene compounds, and vinyl substituted cyclic polysiloxane. To use the elastic composition of this invention to couple the refractive index of the optical fiber joint, the elastic material, crosslinked into membrane form, is inserted into the joint, or the uncrosslinked liquid composition may be filled in the joint gap and then crosslinked. The elastic composition of the present invention must have a post cure elastic modulus in compression of 1.0 x 10 ⁴ to 3.0 x 10 ¹ kg mm² at 25 C. When the elastic composition has an elastic modulus in compression of ωτ 1.0 x 10 ⁴ kg mm², it will flow because the viscosity component of the viscoelastic behavior is increased. The elasticity of an elastic composition with an elastic modulus in compression of λτ 3.0 x 10 ¹ kg mm² is too high and the fiber ends cannot be brought into tight contact. The term elastic material includes tacky materials denoted as gels, elastic materials denoted as elastomers or rubbers, or elastic materials denoted as soft resins may be used as long as the material has a modulus in the above mentioned range. Silica fillers and thermal stabilizers are optionally added to the elastic composition of the present invention. In order to increase the adhesiveness, vinyltrialkoxysilane, γ methacryloxypropyltrialkoxysilane, or siloxanes with alkoxy and methacrylic groups may also be added. In order to raise the strength within the range of the prescribed modulus, organopolysiloxanes composed of CH₃ ₂ CH CH₂ SiO₁ ₂ units and SiO₂ units or organopolysiloxanes composed of CH₃ ₂ CH CH₂ SiO₁ ₂ units, CH₃ ₃SiO₁ ₂ units, and SiO₂ units may also be added. The present invention will be illustrated using examples of execution. Parts and in the examples are parts by weight and weight percent respectively. The viscosity is the value measured at 25 C. 100 Parts dimethylvinylsiloxy terminated dimethylsiloxane methylphenylsiloxane copolymer dimethylsiloxane unit methylphenylsiloxane unit molar ratio 76 24, viscosity, 2 Pa.s 100 Parts dimethylvinylsiloxy terminated dimethylsiloxane diphenylsiloxane copolymer dimethylsiloxane unit diphenylsiloxane unit molar ratio 85 15 viscosity, 1.5 Pa.s 100 Parts dimethylvinylsiloxy terminated dimethylsiloxane methylphenylsiloxane methylvinylsiloxane copolymer molar ratio among siloxane units 64.0 35.5 0.5 viscosity, 3 Pa.s The application of the refractive index coupling elastic composition of the present invention to the gap in an optical fiber joint produces an optical fiber joint which does not suffer from oil leakage, the admixture of air bubbles or from a transmission loss increment. Such an optical fiber joint produced by the above method is crucial to optical fiber communications.
