# EXPLOSIVE CHARGES OBTAINED BY THE COLD MIXING OF OXIDIZING SALTS WITH LIQUID NITRO COMPOUNDS, AND PROCEDURE FOR PRODUCTION OF THE SAME

## Abstract
This invention concerns explosive charges consisting mainly of inorganic nitrates and mixtures of aromatic nitro compounds, in which the mixture of nitro compounds is at least ternary and has a composition such as to lead to melt ing temperatures such that such mixtures are liquid at least at about the ambient temperature.
