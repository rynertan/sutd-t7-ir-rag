# High toughness silicon nitride sintered body and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
A high toughness silicon nitride sintered body compris es silicon nitride as a main component and at least one member selected from the group consisting of silicides and carbides in the form of plate particles, of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and W. In the sintered body, the longer diameter d₁ of principal plane of plate of the plate particles and the shorter diameter d₂ of the same plane has a relation of d₁ d₂ 10, and the thickness of plate of the plate particles is 1 5 or below of d₂.
