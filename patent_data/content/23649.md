# Process for preparing alicyclic isocyanates.

## Abstract
Lactam blocked products of alicyclic isocyanates are ob tained by blocking an aromatic isocyanate with lactam and sub jecting the resulting blocked product to catalytic hydrogena tion with use of a Rh catalyst. The blocked alicyclic isocyanate obtained thus can be used, for example, as a curing agent for synthetic resins such as epoxy resins or as a starting material of urethane coatings. The blocked isocyanate, if desired, may be subject to dis tillation whereby an alicyclic isocyanate is isolated by thermal dissociation and separation of the blocking agent.
