## Description
This invention relates to a system and a method of forming flattened boxes, in particular for containing disk records. As is known in the art, boxes intended for packaging disk records therein are required to possess high structural and aesthetic features, since they perform the dual function of attracting potential buyers of the disk records through the high quality of their appearance, and of protecting from shocks and incidental drops a fragile and sometimes very expensive item, stich as a disk record can be. Besides such basic requisites, disk record packaging boxes must have some desirable features, such as resistance to crshing, thereby they can be stacked without trouble or incidentally put under some heavier object, and low cost, in order for the cost of the box not to affect appreciably the cost of the packaged product. In an effort to meet all these reguirements, boxes of various types have been made and sold in the past, generally formed from some cardboard, and having thcir edges simply folded over and stapled together, or even secured together by means of adhesive tape or glues. Moreover, such cardboard boxes are generally lined both on the inside and outside thereof. In particular, the outer lining is finished with the application of a printed label identifying the record contained in the box and glued to the latter. Such prior boxes are rather complicated to manufacture, mostly involving manual operations, and are weak construction wise and poorly finished from an aesthetic standpoint. The outer sheet, in fact, is often only imperfectly aligned with the box periphery.Accordingly, new boxes have been proposed which have their outer surfaces suitable for overprinting and edges which are interconnected by jointing and glueing. Furthermore, an inside liner has been provided which is formed from an expanded plastics or the like, having good smoothness surface characteristics and being cemented directly to the box inside. Of course, boxes have been made wherein the box body and lid are structurally the same, except for the overall dimension. These boxes have several advantages over the previous ones they are stronger but light, less expensive, and better finished, since the overprinting of either the cardboard body or lid sheet affords excellent results both from the graphical standpoint and that of an accurate alignment of the overprint.However, the procedures involved in the manufacture of such boxes have remained mostly traditional, with a prevailing utilization of manual labor during all those steps which start with blank die cut sheets and end with the finished box. For this reason, the cost of the boxes is still comparatively high, and the production rate relatively low. Thus the task of the invention is to provide a thorough solution to the foregoing problems, by providing a system and method which can afford a fully automates production of boxes for containing records and the like. Within this task it is possible to arrange that the invention provides a system and method for the production of said boxes which also lend themselves to the partial utilization of manual labor, depending on circumstances and preference. It is further possible to arrange that the invention provides a system as indicated, which can be operatively split in several separate and variously located parts, thereby allowing, in addition to the cited utilization of manual labor, an optimum layout of the various parts of the system within a manufacturing plant. These and other objects are all achieved by a method of forming flattened configuration cartons or cases for containing disk records and the like, wherein both the carton containing bottoms and covers are formed from flat quadrangular semi rigid sheets peripherally die cut to present along two opposed sides a first pair of lateral bands extending into tongues at both ends, and a second pair of lateral bands being arranged alternately with said first pair of lateral bands and having no tongues, the method cómprising, according to the invention, the following steps a first step wherein the flat die cut sheet intended to either form. said bottoms, or said covers, or both in a single piece, is caused to advance against stationary folding members operative to fold over said first band pair to overlie each other and secure them permanently a second step wherein one face of said sheet is coated with an adhesive or cement by means of substantially grid like dispensing and spreading members, and wherein said first bands, as folded over and secured to each other, are folded to raise perpendicularly from the sheet plane, thereby two first opposed sides of the carton are formed, whilst the respective tongues are held flexed, by means of movable folding members, in the direction of lay of the adjacent second lateral bands a third step wherein said second tongue less lateral bands are folded over to overlie each other and secure to each other such as to enclose said tongues as previously flexed and form the remaining opposed sides of the carton and a final step wherein all of the carton sides and the carton bottom are stiffened and settled through the insertion, between said carton sides and bottom, of flat plates shaped to size with respect to said bottoms and covers. Advantageously, the system according to the invention which implements the foregoing method is characterized in that it comprises an auxiliary processing line provided substantially with members for continuously entraining said flat die cut sheets in a parallel direction to said first lateral bands with tongues, cementing members and ramp like folding members adapted to cause said first lateral bands tr taere to themselves by acting with a sweeping action on the moving sheets, and in that it comprises a main processing line having first entraining devices effective to translate said sheets, with said first bands being pre folded, in a parallel direction to said second lateral bands, a cementing station provided with grid like dispensing members and adapted to act on those faces of said sheets which will lay on the inside of the carton or case being formed, folding devices operative to position and secure said lateral bands together, and inserting means effective to cause a plate and said carton or case bottom to adhere and become secured together. Further features and advantages will be more clearly understood from the following description of a preferred, though not limitative, embodiment of the invention, as illustrated by way of example in the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 illustrates diagramatically the method of forming a box from a flat and die cut semi rigid sheet Figures 2 and 2a are detail views, respectively of a flat die cut semi rigid sheet in plan view representation, and of the box portion obtained with said sheet in perspective representation Figures 3 and 3a are, respectively, a plan view of a die cut sheet blank for producing a complete carton or case in one piece, and a perspective view of the completed carton or case as formed from said sheet Figures 4 and 5 arg general views of the system implementing the method illustrated in Figure i Figures 6 and 7 are elevation and plan views showing schematically a portion of the machine schematically illustrated in Figure 5 Figure 8 is a plan view of the processing stations diagramatically shown in Figures 6 and 7, with reference to the semi rigid sheets of Figure 2 Figure 9 is a sectional diagramatic side view of a portion of the machine of Figure 5 following that of Figures 6 to 8 Figure 10 is a plan view of the machine portion of Figure 9 and of a successive portion thereof Figure ii is a general, simplified front view of the terminating portion of the machine of Figure 5 Figures 12 to 17 illustrate, partly in perspective, partly in plan view, and partly in section the processing steps which take place at the final box folding station, and the members involved in the folding operation and Figures 18 to 20 show in section how, at said final box folding station, a shaped plate is inserted on the box inside, as well as the members utilized to insert said plate, also shown in Figures 5 and 11. Smith reference to the drawing figures, both the method and the system according to this invention are adapted for manufacturing flattened configuration boxes having substantially identical bottom bodies and lids, excepting for their dimensions and graphical representations. Figure 2a in particular shows a bottom body having a square profile although it will be appreciated that other profiles may be preferred .The body 1 of Figure 2a has a base or bottom 2 of large dimensions which is surrounded by sides 3 extending at 90o with the base 2. Figures 3 and 3a illustrate a completed carton or case, also suitable for production with the method and system according to the invention throughout in fact, both the bottom 1a and cover ib can be formed from a single flexible sheet 4a Figure 3 , which is die cut substantially in the same manner as the sheet 4, the only difference being in the portion 4b interconnecting the bottom with the cover and essentially constituting the connective and rear side of both bodies la and ib with the carton in the closed condition.The pairs of lateral bands 5a and 7a are lined up with each other and identical to the bands 5 and 7 of Figure 2,thereby the complete carton la lb can also be formed with the. method and system of this invention, with the obvious exception of some suitable modifications in the number end dimensions of the cement applying means and plate inserting means, which will be twice in number as those required to form a single bottom or single cover. The description which follows will thus be restricted to the formation of a separate bottom, as illustrated in Figures 1, 2 2a and 4.to 20. The containing body or bottom of a carton is formed, as mentioned hereinabove, from a semi rigid sheet 4 as shown in Figure 2 it has first lateral bands 5 provided with end tabs 6, and second lateral bands 7 which alternate with the former and have no tabs. The method according to the invention for forming the semi rigid sheet 4 into the bottom 1 ofFigure 2a comprises, as shown in Figure 1, a first step 8 wherein the first lateral bands 5 are folded, a second step 9 wherein the first bands are positioned and the tabs folded, a third step 10 wherein the second lateral bands 7 are folded, and a final step ii wherein the bands are set with the insertion of a shaped plate 12.Also provided are auxiliary steps 12a and 12b, wherein the semi rigid sheet 4 is coated with a glue, and connection steps 13a and 13b wherein the sheet is turned over such as to allow the completion of all the folding operations of the lateral bands 5 and 7 by raising the bands above the supporting surfaces. The box forming process is carried out continZlously, with the semi ngid.sheets 4 kep moving, and accordingly and advantageously the lateral bands being folded will always be the ones arranged parallel to the direction of movement of the semirigid sheets. Therefore, it will be necessary to vary the directions of movement of the semi rigid sheets 4 such as to involve all the lateral bands, as shown in Figure 1. The foregoing method, which provides for the assembling of the boxes in question by manipulating separately and sequentially the lateral bands, and with lisplacements and turnovers of the sheets such as to enable manipulation by raising the lateral bands themselves and acting on the fly thereon, makes possible the realization of a potentially fully automated system, for implementing said method. In fact, the invention provides, as shown in Figures 4 to 20, for the boxes in question being formed completely by means of a series of automated operations carried out on machines which can be grouped together to form a single continuous production line. In particular, there may be noted Figure 4 an auxiliary processing line 15 which carries out said first step, and a main processing line 16 Figure 5 which carries out the subsequent steps. The two processing lines, 15 and 16, may be closely interconnected, without any break, by a turnover element, not shown, adapted to perform said connection step 13a. rn detail, the machine which defines the auxiliary processing line 15 of the system substantially comprises, as shown in Figure 4, a loading station 17 whereat the semi rigid sheet 4 of Figure 4 is laid down positioned with the first lateral bands 5 parallel to the direction of lay of the line 15 itself. The sheet 4 is caused to advance by entraining members 18S shown schematically, which comprise, for example, entrainment chains.In its movement, the sheet 4 moves from the loading station 17 to glueing members 19 which are constructed to apply a glue or cement to the first lateral bands 5, as taught in the cited auxiliary step 12a. The glueing members 19 are controlled, for example, by a sensor which detects the passing and exiting of the sheet 4. Also provided are folding members 20 which, by acting on the moving sheets on the fly while being entrained by the entraining members 18, force the first lateral bands.5 to fold upon themselves and adhere closely. The structure of these folding members 20 may be any one, and in particular may be similar to that of the pre folding elements which will be described with reference to the main processing line 16. At the loading station 17, the sheet 4 is arranged with its face 2a, which is intended to remain on the box inside, facing upwards, and the first lateral bands 5 are obviously folded such that the outer face 2b prevails on the inner face 2a. It follows that, for the transition from the auxiliary processing line 15 to the main processing line 16, there must be inserted a turnover device if the transition is carried out in an automated manner. In the event of manual transition from the auxiliary processing line 15 to the main processing line 16, the sheet 4, with the first lateral bands 5 already folded upon themselves but still substantially coplanar with the base 2, must be positioned by an operator onto a starting station 21, with the second lateral bands 7 parallel to the direction of advance on the line 16 and the outer face 2b facing upwards. Figures 6 and 7 show how from the starting station 21 the sheet 4 is inserted, bg means of a reciprocating translator element 22, to contact first entrainment devices 23 of the chain type which force the sheet to advance. During the advance movement, the second lateral bands 7 contact pre folding elements 24, shown schematically in Figures 6 and 7, as well as in Figure 5, which strain reiieve the folds in the lateral bands 7.These pre folding elements are shown in detail in Figure 8 they comprise first guides 24a so warped relatively to one another as to fold the second lateral bands 7 in two first straighteners 24b, which substantially bring the second lateral bands back to a situation of coplanarity with the base or bottom 2 and are defined by bearings arranged to press on the fords second guides 24c which fold the second lateral bands at their bordering line with the base 2 and second straighteners 24d. It may be seen that, as mentioned, the cited fording members 20 are similar to the pre folding elements 24, e.g. comprising guides so warped as to fold the first lateral bands 5 and bearings which confirm by a sqeezing action the prepared fold. The first entrainment devices 23, and the are folding elements 24, are terminated at a glueing station 25. At this station, the semi rigid sheet 4, with the first lateral bands 5 folded and glued, and the second lateral bands 7 strain relieved along the folding lines, is held above a grid 26 wherethrough a grid like template 27 can be raised which is wetted with glue. Said sheet is positioned with its inner face 2a facing the grid 26, and the exact position is ensured, there the first entrainment devices 23 are terminated at a distance from the glueing station, by a pusher element, not shown. The particular configuration of the quadrangular grid template 27 has proved itself to be suitable to create a concentration of cement or adhesive along the creasing fold lines of the carton sides, which concentration enables the carton sides, as folded perpendicularly to the sheet, to be stiffened, and accordingly to impart high strength features to the completed carton. Figure 9 shows in particular that the template 27 is carried on a stem 28 which can be controlled to move upwards by a fluid dynamically operated cylinder. An accurate and strong contact between the template 27, wet with glue, and sheet 4 is provided by th backing action of a turnover element 29, more clearly visible in Figures 9 and 10. Zore specifically, the turnover element 29 comprises a tilting plate equipped with suction cups 30, wbich plate, by rotation about a substantially horizontal pivot pin, can move from a position whereat it rests outo the sheet 4, at the glueing station 25, to a fully tilted position with the suction cups upside down. In its rotational movement, the turnover element 29 entrains the sheet 4 therealong, by virtue of the suction cups 30, thus moving the sheet from the glueing station 25 to a delivery station 31 defined by the turnover element itself,. in its turned over condition.The sheet 4 is presented into tie delivery station 31 with its outer face facing up and arranged along a transverse line of movement to the one followed up to that moment, as shown in particular in Figure 5. Moreover, the sheet 4 is inserted, as it is entrained by said suction cups, between first side ridges 33 which force the first lateral bands 5, previously folded over and glued, to arrange themselves at 900 to the base or bottom 2. At the delivery station 31, there operates a carriage pusher 32 actuated by a fluid dynamic cylinder and shown particularly in Figures 10 and 11.The carriage pusher 32 is reciprocated along a parallel direction to the first lateral bands 5 and first side ridges 33, thus carrying the sheet 4 to either of two final stations 34, whereat the box forming process is completed, as shown in Figures 11 to 20. It should be noted that the turnover element 29 and carriage pusher 32 define second entrainment devices. As shown in Figures 11 to 20, at the stations 34, there are provided linlrages and detent elements which alternate operatively to one another, and inverter means effective to apply said shaped plate 12.In detail, at each final station 34, said linkages and detent elements are defined by second side ridges 35 arranged as an extension from the first side ridges 33 and being overlapped by strips 36 set to protrude partially such as to prevent the raising of the sides defined by the first lateral bands 5 by pin type pushers 37 located at the ends of the second side ridges 35 and movable transversely thereto by tiltable sides 38 extending transversely to the second side ridges 35 by a stop 39 ntersecting the tiltable s ides 38 and by folding arms 40 which oscillate and are positionable with their working ends above the tiltable sides 38, when the latter ars in their raised position.The pin pushers 37 are provided, as shown in Figures 12 and 13,to fold the tabs 6 inwardly and set them aligned with the second lateral bands 7. The pin pushers 37 are controlled to retract upon the tiltable sides 38 being raised as shown in Figure 14, thus forcing the second lateral bands 7 to arrange themselves substantially at 900 to the base or bottom 2 of the sheet being folded.It is to be noted that before operating the pin pushers 37 and tiltable sides 38, the semi rigid sheet 4 is properly positioned by a stop 39 which is partly inserted through a slit in the sides 38. The semi rigid sheet 4, folded as shown inFigure 14 and in plan view in Figure 15, is acted upon by said arms 40, shown more clearly in Figures 16 to 18. These arms carry out the folding of the end flaps of the second lateral bands 7 prior to the operation of the cited inserter means. he latter, as shown particularly in Figures 11, 18, 19 and 20, are in the form of rocker paddles 41 having suction cup elements 42 for supporting the shaped plates 12 and inserting them between the sides 3 of the box. The paddles 41 are so costructed as to perform themselves the final folding of the second lateral bands 7. As shown in Figure 18, as the paddles 41 are inserted, the arms 40 are retracted and Figure 19 the shaped plates 12 fully fold upon themselves the second lateral bands 7, thus enveloping the tabs. Furthermore and advantageously, above the paddles 41, fluid dynamically controlled pressers 43 are provided which Figure 20 squeeze the second lateral bands 7 such as to enhance the fold, and then move back to a retracted position in order to permit the raising of the paddle which supports them. The method and system according to the invention fully achieve their objects. In fact, not only a method has been made available which. can be fully implemented on an automated machine, but also a system made up of several lines which may be separated from one another and independently controlled. The invention as described and illustrated is susceptible to many modifications and variations without departing from the purview of the instant inventive concept. Thus, as an example, the system may include a number of auxiliary members, such as a perfuser 44 at the glue supply and others, the final statit 34 being in any desired number. In practicing the invention, the materials used, the number and dimensions of the various members, as well as their relative positions, may vary in accorance with the size of the die cut sheet blank, it being contemplated, according te the Invention, that said sheet may be made substantially. square to form a cover and bottom separately, or rectangular for the formation of a carton or case.
