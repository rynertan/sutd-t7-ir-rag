# Percussion musical instrument drum head skin tensioning assembly and drum shell construction therefor.

## Abstract
One 12 of a pair of concentric ring hoops 12, 13 overlaps the other 13 and holds the perimeter edge of a drum head vibratile element 20 in tension between the mating overlapping faces of the hoops 12, 13 . The hoops 12, 13 are held together by a tensioning bolt 15 threadable into a bracket 14 connected to a lower hoop 17 which has another skin 18 stretched between a stepped inner annular grove 54 on its inner face edge. A drum shell 22 made of a composite of rigid foam interior spaced apart by a pair of epoxy impregnated carbon fibre sheets is held by the lower second drum skin 18 into enclosing engagement on its upper perimeter edge with an inner stop flange 46 and vertical wall face of the inner hoop ring 13 of the drum head vibratile skin assembly.
