# Receivers suitable for use in remotely operable switching devices and data transmission systems.

## Abstract
A receiver, for digital modulated carrier signals com prises means to produce an output signal which contains the digital signal. Because of repeated filtering, the digital signal is typically in the form of an approximately sinusoidal signal, which has a component whose frequency is equal to half the basic bit rate of the digital signal because of noise, this component is subject to considerable timing jitter. To over come this, the output signal is digitised and applied to a microprocessor as digital correlator, where it is correlated with a reference signal whose freuqency is also equal to half the basic bit rate of the digital signal. The reference signal is preferably derived from a phase locked loop locked to the carrier frequency. The correlator determines the instants of time which most nearly coincide with the mean level crossing points of said component, and also determines successive bit values
