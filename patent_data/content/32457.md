# IMPROVEMENTS IN LOAD LIFTING AND LOWERING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Vehicle mounted load lifting and lowering apparatus comprises a parallel arm linkage 14,16,17 pivotally mounted at one end thereof on part 11 of a vehicle and arranged above the vehicle floor 13 . A drop arm 18 is pivotally mounted on and extends below the other end of the parallel arm linkage. A platform 23 is mounted on the drop arm 18 at or adjacent the lower end thereof and is pivotable about a horizontal axis between a load carrying position and a stowed position. A ram 19 is expandable and contractable to rotate the parallel arm linkage between the first position in which the platform lies at ground level, a second position in which the platform is supported at the level of the vehicle floor and a third position in which, with the platform in the stowed position, the apparatus is stowed above the vehicle floor.
