## Description
TITLE THERMOPLASTIC ELASTOMERIC COMPOSITIONS BASED ON COMPATIBLE BLENDS OF AN ETHYLENE COPOLYMER AND VINYL OR VINYLIDENE HALIDE POLYMER The subject application is a continuation of copending application U.S.S.N. 394,329 filed July 1, 1982. BACKGROUND Blends of ethylene copolymers and vinyl halide polymers crosslinked during or subsequent to molding into shaped articles are known in the art as detailed in French Patent 2,148,496. The molded articles prepared from these compositions, however, suffer the disadvantage of being thermoset due to the high degree of crosslinking effectuated and, hence, are not reprocessible or remoldable. Elastomeric thermoplastic compositions based on partially crosslinked incompatible blends of polypropylene and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are also known in the art as detailed in U.S. Patent 4,232,132. This incompatibility results in a multiphase system having a crosslinked elastomeric phase and an uncross linked hard phase. However, the elastomeric properties of these compositions e.g. permanent tensile set are poor relative to the elastomeric properties of the compositions of the subject invention. SUlEMARY OF THE INVENTION The subject invention is a thermoplastic, inherently melt processible elastomeric composition based on partially crosslinked compatible blends of an ethylene copolymer and a vinyl or vinylidene halide polymer. The melt processibility of these compositions allows shaped articles to be molded therefrom without the time consuming cure step required with conventional rubbers. More specifically, the subject invention is a thermoplastic elastomeric composition comprising a partially crosslinked blend of a a copolymer of ethylene and one or more copolymerizable comonomers selected from the group consisting of ethylenically unsaturated organic monomers, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide and b between 5 and 75 weight percent based on the composition of a vinyl halide or vinylidene halide polymer, wherein the comonomer content is such that the copolymer exhibits compatiblity with the vinyl or vinylidene halide polymer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The ethylene copolymers useful in the practice of the subject invention include, for example, those dipolymers having the formula E X and Ely, and those terpolymers having the formula E X Y, where X is an ethylenically unsaturated organic monomer and Y is either carbon monoxide or sulfur dioxide. Exemplary of the organic monomers are those selected from the group consisting of unsaturated mono or dicarboxylic acids of 3 20 carbon atoms, esters of said unsaturated mono or dicarboxylic acids, vinyl esters of saturated carboxylic acids where the acid group has 2 18 carbon atoms, vinyl alkyl ethers wherein the alkyl group has 1 18 carbon atoms, vinyl or vinylidene halides, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, norbornene, alpha olefines of 3 12 carbon atoms, and vinyl aromatic compounds.Preferred organic monomers include methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate and vinyl acetate. Of course, more than one of these organic monomers may be copolymerized with ethylene to form the ethylene copolymer useful in the practice of the subject invention. The melt index range for these copolymers is 0.1 to 1000 ASTM D 1238 , preferably 1 to 100. The ethylene copolymers useful in the practice of the subject invention need have sufficient comonomer copolymerized therein to exhibit compatability with the vinyl and vinylidene halide polymers described below. Generally speaking, when the ethylene copolymer is represented by the formulaE X, copolymers having a comonomer content of greater than 45 percent based on the weight of the copolymer are useful in the practice of this invention when the ethylene copolymer is represented by the formula E Y, copolymers having a comonomer content greater than about 15 percent are useful in the practice of this invention and when the ethylene copolymer is represented by the formula E X Y, copolymers with substantially lower comonomer content exhibit compatibility with vinyl and vinylidene halide polymers, i.e. the ethylene content in these terpolymers should be 40 to 85 percent, the organic monomer content 1 to 60 percent, and the carbon monoxide or sulfur dioxide content 1 to 30 percent, all based on polymer weight. Since copolymers of theE X type require such a high comonomer content to exhibit compatibility with vinyl and vinylidene halide polymers as compared to copolymers of theE X Y type, these E X Y copolymers are especially preferred for purposes of the subject invention.When an ethylene copolymer is used which is not sufficiently compatible with the vinyl or vinylidene polymers, shaped articles molded from the blends are opaque, show stress whitening when stretched and lack the required recovery to be considered elastomeric.A more detailed discussion of the compatability of these ethylene copolymers with vinyl and vinylidene halide polymers, as well as a discussion of the preparation of the copolymers can be found in Polymer Polymer Miscibility, O. Olabisi, L. M.Robeson and M. T. Shaw, Academic Press, N.Y., N.Y., 1979, U.S. Patent 3,684,778 and U.S. Patent 3,780,140, all herein incorporated by reference. The ethylene copolymers described above are blended in accordance with the subject invention with 5 to 75, preferably 20 to 60, weight percent based on the blended composition of vinyl or vinylidene halide polymers including copolymers resulting from copolymerization with a comonomer selected from the group consisting of vinyl esters, acrylonitrile, acrylic esters, vinylidene chloride, vinyl chloride, esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids and vinyl ethers. For example, polyvinyl chloride having an inherent viscosity of 0.30 to 1.4 ASTM D 1243 is generally useful in the practice of the subject invention. The blending of the ethylene copolymer with the vinyl or vinylidene halide polymer is accomplished by any one of a number of conventional techniques, for example, in a Banbury mixer, two roll mill or extruder. This blending is done at a temperature high enough to soften the polymers for adequate blending, but not so high as to degrade the vinyl or vinylidene halide polymer. Generally speaking this blending temperature ranges from 140 to 200 C, and blending is carried out for a time sufficient to homogeneously blend the components. The critical aspect of the subject invention is the partial crosslinking of the compatible blend.This can be carried out using any one or more of the well known crosslinking techniques including electron beam irradiation, gamma irradiation and free radical curatives such as peroxides. The cross linking of the polymer blends of the subject invention can be carried out before or concurrently with blending with the vinyl or vinylidene halide polymers, or after such blending when using radiation techniques to effectuate the crosslinking. If the ethylene copolymer in the blend contains carbon monoxide, diamines such as methylene dianiline or p phenylene diamine can be used to effectuate the desired crosslinking. If the ethylene copolymer is ethylene vinyl acetate carbon monoxide, sulfur vulcanizing agents can be used as detailed in U.S.4,172,939. For crosslinking ethylene copolymers containing carboxylic acid functionalities, the formation of ionic crosslinks is suitable in the practice of the subject invention, and is achieved with various metal oxides or hydroxides such as ZnO and NaOH, or with organometallics such as chromium acetylacetone, as detailed in U.S. 4,304, 887. The term 1 partially crosslinked refers to a degree of cross linking sufficient to transform a blend of an ethylene copolymer as detailed above and a vinyl or vinylidene halide polymer into the thermoplastic elastomeric blends of the subject invention. To quantify the degree of crosslinking, the amount of insoluble, and hence crosslinked, polymer is determined by soaking a sample of the polymer, after crosslinking, in tetrahydrofuran at 23 C for 16 hours, isolating the insoluble portion and weighing the dried residue, making suitable corrections based upon knowledge of the composition. For example, the weight of components soluble in tetrahydrofuran such as plasticizers are subtracted from the initial weight and components insoluble in tetrahydrofuran, such as pigments, fillers, etc. are subtracted from both the initial and final weight.The insoluble polymer recovered is reported as percent gel content. This procedure is based on a conventional procedure for quantifying degree of crosslinking that is more fully detailed in U.S.3,203,937. For purposes of the subject invention, the polymer blends need be partially crosslinked so that they have a gel content of 5 to 90 percent, preferably 10 to 70 percent based on total polymer.The conditions under which this crosslinking is carried out, i.e., type and quantity of crosslinking agent, cross linking time and temperature, to arrive at a composition having a gel content within this operable range, can be determined empirically. Vihen chemical crosslinking agents are utilized, it is preferable that they be substantially totally consumed during the crosslinking step. when polyvinyl chloride PVC is utilized as the vinyl halide polymer in the practice of the subject invention, spectroscopic evidence indicates that the gel fractions isolated from those partially crosslinked polymer blends contain only crosslinked ethylene copolymer, with no detectable PVC present.It is theorized, therefore, that essentially no crosslinking of the PVC occurs. Although not essential components of the composition of this invention, various amounts of any number of conventional fillers or compounding ingredients may be admixed. Examples of such ingredients include various carbon blacks, clays, silica, alumina, calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide, antioxidants, antidegradants, tackifiers, processing aids such as lubricants and waxes, and plasticizers such as dialkylphthalates, trialkylmellitates and polyester oligomers. The amounts used depend, at least in part, upon the quantities of other ingredients in the composition and the properties desired from the composition. Also, minor amounts of other saturated and unsaturated polymers such as alpha olefins may be added to reduce the cost or modify the properties of the composition. The compositions of the subject invention are melt processible using conventional plastic processing equipment. Articles molded from the unique thermoplastic elastomeric compositions of the subject invention exhibit properties generally only associated with vulcanized rubber. For example, these compositions have resistance to compression set values of about 20 to 70 percent 70 to 100XC and elongation at break values of 150 to 600 percent without substantial permanent tensile set i.e., less than about 15 percent . Various uses for these compositions include wire coverings, seals and gaskets, automotive parts, sheet liners and packaging films. They can be used to coat fabric, industrial belts and various hard surfaces by extrusion coating, for example, polyester, polyamide, polyimide or metal fibre or fabric reinforcement.They find utility in adhesive and sealant applications, as well as for modification of other polymer systems. Further, compositions within the scope of this invention can be fabricated into tubing for laboratory, medical and industrial uses. Such tubing could also be used as the inner tube of reinforced hoses, wherein the extruded tube is overlaid with wire or textile cords, applied as a spiral, knit or braid. Optionally, a polymeric covering may be applied extruded or spiral wound calendered sheet over the reinforced tubing to provide protection from the working environment and mechanical abuse.Compositions within the scope of this invention can be used as the protective covering of reinforced tubes of similar or different composition. The subject invention will be more fully appreciated with reference to the examples that follow EXAMPLE 1 Unless otherwise specified, the percentages given in all examples herein are on a weight percent basis. The intrinsic viscosities iv given for the polyvinyl chloride PVC are measured in solutions of 0.2 g of the polymer in 100 ml of cyclohexanone at 25 C. The melt indexes MI of the ethylene copolymers are measured at 1900C according to ASTMD 1238. The following formulations were blended as described below.

The extruder was run at 50 rpm and at temperatures designed to produce melt temperatures of 130 Ct 163 1700C and 180 193 ec . At all three temperature ranges, the melt was extruded through a feather edged profile die known as a Garvey Die. The profile extrusion demonstration described above shows that compositions within the scope of this invention can be extruded as complex profiles, at relatively low melt temperatures, using standard extruders of L D common to the rubber industry. Such extruded profiles could be used as gasketing or miscellaneous mechanical goods.Continuous Extrusion Coating of Wire Formulation C of Example IV, in pellet or cut granule form, were fed to a 1 1 4 inch 3.2cm diameter Brabender extruder, with a single stage plastics screw, having a length to diameter ratio of 25 1. The extruder was fitted with a crosshead die sized to produce a 0.050 inch 0.13cm thick coating on 12 AWG aluminum wire at a melt temperature of 197or and at rates of from 20 to 100 feet 0.6 30m per minute. The wire demonstration described above and the subsequently obtained physical and electrical properties show that compositions within the scope of this invention can be used to fabricate coated wire and cable, either as low voltage primary insulation or as jacketing or semiconductive coating in higher voltage constructions. Milling and Calendering Sheet Formulation C of Example IV, in pellet form, was massed and banded on a 8 X 20 inch 0.2 0.5m two rubber mill, with a roll surface speed ratio of 1.2 1, and a roll temperature of 225 F 107 ec . The polymer band was cut from the mill roll at a stock temperature of 2700F 132 C and transferred to a three roll rubber calender. With all three rolls held at 2600F 275 F 127 C 1350C , a reasonably smooth sheet of 0.015 inch .04cm thickness was formed and easily released, when cut from the center calender roll. Similar results were obtained when up to 20 phr. fumed silica and 10 phr. dioctyl sebecate were blended into the polymer band on the rubber mill, prior to calendering. The milling and calendering demonstration described above. shows that compositions within the scope of this invention can be fluxed and further compounded on rubber mills and then fabricated into sheet, using moderate processing temperatures, on standard rubber calenders. Such formed sheet may be used unsupported for elastomeric packaging film, or calendered onto fabrics or onto a web of reinforcing cords in single or multiple plies to be used for roofing pit and pond liners, die cut gasketing, diaphragms conveyor belting and for general purpose coated fabric applications.
