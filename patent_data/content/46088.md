# Polyalkylenepolyamine derivatives and their use as curing agents for polyurethanes.

## Abstract
The excessively fast reaction time produced by using polyoxyalkylene polyamines as curing agents for polyurethane formation can be moderated by reacting the polyoxyalkylene polyamines 1 , with 2 derivatives of acrylic acid or alpha substituted acrylic acids having terminal hydroxy groups, or with 3 compounds having oxirane rings. Alternatively the reaction product of 1 and 2 can be further reacted with 3 , or the reaction product of 1 and 3 can be further reacted with 2 . Preferred reactants are 1 polyoxypropylene diamines and triamines, and polyox yethylene bis propylene diamines 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, methacrylate or alphacyanoacry late, and diethylene glycol monoacrylate and 3 ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, n butylglycidyl ether and styrene oxide.
