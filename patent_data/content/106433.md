# HEAT RECOVERY ENGINE

## Abstract
Engine powered by extracting heat from a flow of internal combustion engine exhaust gases or other fluid medium has input and output flow control gates 10,14 defining a controlled section of a duct 12 along which said flow passes, the gates operating to pass the flow continuous ly along that section while maintaining a pressure differential therein. A pressure drop or rise in that section is continuous ly provided by cooling or injection of fluid to be vaporised so as to extract heat from the medium and this pressure differential drives a motor 18 and or itself drives the gates to provide useful work, for example driving an electric generator 25 .
