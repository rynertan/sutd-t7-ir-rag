It is also known that these polysaccharides have antitumor activity. However, various problems, for example, low yields, complicated production process, toxicity, etc., are encountered in using such polysaccharides as an antitumor agent.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, it has been found that a novel polysaccharide RIN substance can be obtained from rice bran, and that the polysaccharide RIN substance is effective as an antitumor agent, an immunomodulating agent, a host defense agent against infectious disease, and an inducer of tumor necrosis factor. The present invention relates to 1 a novel polysaccharide RIN substance 2 a process for producing the polysaccharide RIN substance which comprises the steps of treating a rice bran with hot water to extract said polysaccharide RIN substance into the water, adding a polar organic solvent or a salting out agent to the water containing the extracted substance to form precipitates containing said polysaccharide RIN substance, isolating the precipitates 3 an antitumor agent containing the polysaccharideRIN substance as an effective ingredient 4 an immunomodulating agent containing the polysaccharide RIN substance as an effective ingredient 5 a host defense agent against infectious disease containing the polysaccharide RIN substance as an effective ingredient and 6 an inducer of tumor necrosis factor containing the polysaccharide RIN substance as an effective ingredient.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is an ultraviolet absorption spectrum of the polysaccharide RIN substance produced by the process of the present invention Fig. 2 is an infrared absorption spectrum of said polysaccharide RIN substance Fig. 3 is a 13C NMR spectrum of said polysaccharideRIN substance.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel polysaccharide RIN substance, a process for the production of said substance, and antitumor agent, immunomodulating agent, host defense agent against infectious disease, and inducer of tumor necrosis factor containing said substance as the effective component. The polysaccharide RIN substance of this invention is obtained from rice bran by extraction and purification. This rice bran is a by product obtained in the production of polished rice fromunpolished rice, and it is not limited by the variety of the unpolished rice, the producing district, the degree of polishing rate, etc. Prior to the extraction and purification of the polysaccharide RIN substance from the rice bran, it is desirable to fully wash the rice bran in order to eliminate the pulverized or crushed rice and other impurities. Those rice brans which have already been used for other purposes, such for example as defatted rice bran, which is a residue after extraction of rice bran oil from rice bran, can be used in this invention. The polysaccharide RIN substance of this invention is produced by adding organic solvents or salting out agents to an extract obtained by hot water treatment of rice bran to provide precipitates and, if desired, dissolving the obtained precipitates in water to purify them. The rice bran is passed through a separator, for example, a screen, to remove impurities and is washed with water, if necessary, after pulverization. It is desirable to remove a lipid soluble fraction using organic solvents, such as ethyl acetate, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ether, n hexane, benzene, petroleum ether, acetone etc. The hot water treatment of the rice bran is carried out by feeding rice bran and distilled or purified water in amount of about 2 100 times, preferably about 5 10 times to that of the rice bran to a vessel with or without stirring under the conditions of pressure of from 0 to 90 kg cm2, preferably from 0 to 5.0 kg cm2 and a temperature of from 500C to 3000C, preferably from 1000C to 1500C for 10 minutes to 24 hours, preferably 0.5 to 5 hours. Practically it is suitable to carry out the hot water treatment at a pressure of from 0 to 3.0 kg cm2 and a temperature of from 1000C to 1400C for 1 to 5 hours. The extract obtained by the hot water treatment is subjected to operations such as filtration, centrifugation, etc. to separate solids and, if necessary, is then concentrated to an appropriate volume by applying such means as concentration at a reduced pressure, ultrafiltration, etc., singly or in combination with each other. By collecting precipitates formed by adding a watersoluble polar organic solvent or a salting out agent to the extract, a crude polysaccharide RIN substance is obtained. Polar organic solvents which can be used in this procedure include methanol, ethanol, propanol, acetone, etc.The amount of the polar organic solvent being used is determined taking into account the amount of the desired substance contained in the extract, etc. For example, in the case of ethanol, it may be added in such a manner that the ethanol concentration is 30 to 50 v v . The formed precipitates are preferably washed with the organic solvent as described above, for example, ethanol, etc. Salting out agents which can be used in the above procedure include sodium chloride, ammonium sulfate, and potassium chloride. The salting out agent is usually added until the degree of saturation reaches 0.5 to 1 to thereby form precipitates. The deproteinization and purification of the polysaccharide RIN substance can be carried out either prior to the addition of the organic solvent or salting out agent to the extract or after the formation of precipitates by the addition of the organic solvent or salting out agent followed by dissolving the precipitates in water. For the purification and deproteinization treatment, various known procedures can be applied. For example, amylolytic enzyme and or proteolytic enzyme is added to a solution containing the polysaccharide RIN substance to convert impurities existing therein, such as starch, protein, etc., into low molecular weight compounds. These low molecular weight compounds are removed at a subsequent purification step. As such enzymes, an amylolytic enzyme, for example a amylase, a proteolytic enzyme, for example pronase, and if necessary, other enzymes can be used. In this enzyme treatment, it is preferred that the enzyme is added in a ratio of from 1 1000 to 1 5000 of the substrate and that the treatment is carried out for 0.5 to 24 hours, preferably 1 to 15 hours. Additionally, the following purification and deproteinization methods can be used a method in which an inorganic or organic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, tannic acid, trichloroacetic acid, etc. is added to an aqueous solution containing the above described polysaccharide RIN substance in a proportion of about 0.1 to 10 wt. , preferably about 3 to 5 wt. .When precipitates are formed, they are removed by such operations as filtration, cetrifugation, etc. and subsequently the remaining acids, inorganic ions and low molecular fractions are dialyzed for 1 to 3 days against a running water or a distilled water using a dialysis membrane an ion exchange method in which a cation or anion exchanger, is used an ultrafiltration method in which a membrane having an exclusive molecular weight of 10,000 to 100,000 is used gel filtration centrifugation treatment with active carbon concentration and a combination thereof. The Sevag s method is also applicable for deproteinization. Furthermore the RIN substance can be treated by using acids and or some enzymes to lower the molecular weight thereof. A large amount of protein can be removed from polysaccharide RIN substance by the above described methods. These purification methods can be applied singly or in combination with each other, and such combinations and the order in which they are applied are subject to no limitations. When an aqueous solution of high molecular polysaccharideRIN substance which has been purified by the above described methods was applied on such an anion exchanger column asAmberlite IR 4B, DEAE Sepharose, or DEAE Cellulose, the fractions eluted with an aqueous solution of electrolyte such as NaCl, etc. from 0.05 to 0.4 N, preferably from 0.07 to 0.2 N was collected and desalted by dialysis. From these fractions, a white powdery polysaccharide RIN substance can be obtained either by lyophilization, spray drying, or precipitation with a polar organic solvent. The thus obtained polysaccharide RIN substance has the following physical and chemical properties This substance has as a structural repetition unitEMI7.1 wherein G is a D glucopyranosyl group, sum of n and n is 4. The number of the repetition unit N is N 10, and does not pass through a dialysis membrane thus, the molecular weight of this substance may be about 10,000 or more, and is insoluble in organic solvents, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, etc., acetone, hexane, benzene, ethylacetate, ligroin, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and ethers, but is soluble in water, dimethylsulfoxide, formamide A 1 aqueous solution of the present substance is neutral. The present substance has no melting point and it turns brown at 2200C and black at 2800C carbonizing Elementary analysis shows that the present substance obtained in Example 1 as described later comprises 41.39 of carbon, 6.09 of hydrogen, 0.13 of nitrogen and 3.20 of ash. A 1 aqueous solution of the present substance is positive in the following color reactions phenol sulfuric acid reaction, anthrone sulfuric acid reaction, chromotropesulfuric acid reaction, biulet reaction and the Lowry Folin reaction and negative in the following color reaction theElson Morgan reaction and starch iodine reaction The specific rotation of the present substance is 20 cil, The ash component comprises Si, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, C1, etc. When RIN substance is applied on gel filtration withSepharose CL 6B Pharmacia Chemicals AB , these elements and polysaccharide component of the substance are co eluted in a void volume. Therefore it is assumed that the above elements do not exist independently as a contaminant in RIN substance, but they exist in the state that they are bound chemically to a skeleton of RIN substance. On developing with the four solvents as noted below in the thin layer chromatographic analysis of those products obtained by complete hydrolysis of the RIN substance with formic acid and sulfuric acid, no spots except for the one identified as glucose could be detected. 1 ethyl acetate methanol acetic acid water 65 15 10 10 2 ethyl acetate isopropanol water 65 23 12 3 isopropanol pyridine water acetic acid 8 8 4 1 4 n butanol pyridine water 6 4 3 Thus it can be concluded that the present RIN substance is a polysaccharide consisting essentially of glucose as a sole sugar component. The present RIN substance has an ultraviolet absorption spectrum as shown in Fig. 1, an infrared absorption spectrum as shown in Fig. 2, and a 13C NMR spectrum as shown in Fig. 3.From these spectra and specific rotation, it is assumed that the a bond exists in the RIN substance. Based upon the above described data, it is assumed that the RIN substance of this invention is a polysaccharide comprising glucose as a sole sugar component. Moreover, on periodate oxidation, the present RIN sub stance consumed 1.78 mole of sodium periodate and released 0.81 mole of formic acid per glucose residue. The Smithdegradation procedure of this substance gave a lot of glycerine detected by paper chromatographic analysis. Methylation analysis of this substance yielded 2,3,4,6 tetramethylglucose I 2,3,4 trimethyl glucose II and 2,3 dimethylglucose III ,and the relative ratio of these compounds were as follows I II III 1 4 1 Based upon the above described data., it is assumed that the RIN substance of this invention is a polysaccharide having as a structural repetition unitEMI10.1 wherein G is a D glucopyranosyl group, sum of n and n is 4. It has been made clear that the polysaccharide RIN substance of this invention has various biological activities such as antitumor, immunomodulating, host defense activities against infectious diseases and inducing activity of tumor necrosis factor. The methods and results of testing these biological activities of the polysaccharide RIN substance produced in the Example 1 will be described in detail. 1 Antitumor activities a Effect of intraperitoneal administration of the RIN substance against a syngeneic tumor Meth A Fifty 6 week old female BALB C CRJ mice average weight, 20 grams g were transplanted with Meth A tumor cells 1x105 cells mouse intraperitoneally, which had been grown for one week intraperitoneally in the mouse of the same strain. These mice were divided into four groups a group of 20 mice as a control group and three groups of 10 mice each as test groups. For 5 consecutive days from the day after the transplantation of the tumor cells, the RIN substance dissolved in a saline was administered intraperitoneally in a dose of 10, 30 or 100 milligrams per kilogram mg kg for the test groups. For the control group, on the other hand, only a saline was administered in the same manner.The survival time days was measured and the prolongation of life was calculated by the following equation Average survival time Prolongation days for test group of life Average survival time x 100 days for control group b Effect of oral administration of the RIN substance against a syngeneic tumor Meth A Fifty 6 week old female BALB C CRJ mice average weight, 20 g were transplanted with Meth A tumor cells 1x104 cells mouse subcutaneously in the axillary region, which had been grown for one week intraperitoneally in the mouse of the same strain. These mice were divided into four groups a group of 20 mice as a control group and three groups of 10 mice each as test groups.For 10 consecutive days from the day after the transplantation of the tumor cells, the RIN substance dissolved in a saline was administered orally in a dose of 10, 30 or 100 mg kg, for the test groups. For the control group, on the other hand, only a saline was administered in the same manner. Thirty five days after the transplantation of the tumor cells, mice were killed and the tumor developed was cut away and weighed. The inhibition ratio was calculated by the following equation EMI11.1 tb SEP Average SEP weight SEP of SEP tumor tb Inhibition 1 for SEP test SEP group SEP SEP v SEP 100 tb ratio SEP SEP 1 SEP Average SEP weight SEP of SEP tumor tb SEP for SEP control SEP group tb The antitumor activities of the RIN substance as assayed by the above described methods a and b are shown in the Table I.

In addition, it has been confirmed that the RIN substance was also effective against Lewis lung carcinoma,Melanoma B 16, Sarcoma 180, and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, within a dose range of from 10 to 100 mg kg by intraperitoneal or oral administration with the results that the tumor inhibition ratio was from 30 to 70 . Furthermore, the RIN substance is of no toxicity as described hereinafter. Thus the RIN substance is believed to find use as a very effective antitumor agent. 2 Immunomodulating activities a Carbon clearance test CCT This test is used to examine the effect of a substance to enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophage amongst the immunomodulating actions. The RIN substance dissolved in a saline was administered intraperitoneally to a test group of six 4 week old femaleICR CRJ mice average weight, 20 g for 2 days. On the other hand, only a saline was administered for the control group in the same manner. At the third day, 0.25 ml of a carbon solution prepared by diluting a black ink Fount India manufactured by Perikan Co. with a saline to 5 times was injected into the tail vein. Just after the injection and also 10 minutes after the injection, 0.025 ml of blood was collected from the venous plexus of the retro orbit of the mice, suspended in 3.5 ml of a 0.01 M sodium carbonate solution, and the absorbance OD650 at 650 nm was measured to determine a rate of decrease in the concentration of the carbon in the blood.This is indicated by a phagocytic index as defined by the following equation logC1 logC2 Phagocytic index K . T2 T1 where C1 is an absorbance OD650 at the time T1 and C2 is that at the time T2. With regard to tumor bearing mice, Sarcoma 180 cells were transplanted in the muscle of the hind leg of the mice 1x107 cells mouse 7 days before the start of administration of the RIN substance and, thereafter, the mice were tested in the same manner as above. The results are shown in the Table II. Table II Normal Mice Tumor bearing MiceSample Dose Phagocytic Relative Phagocytic Relative mg kg Index Value Index Value control 38.0x10 3 100 103x10 3 100 Saline 10 54.0 142 125 121RIN Sub 30 87.4 230 168 163 stance 100 80.9 213 148 144 It can be seen from the results shown in the Table II that for both of the normal and the tumor bearing mice the administration of the RIN substance in an amount of from 10 to 100 mg kg, particularly in 30 mg kg enhanced the function of the reticuloendothelial system of the mice and greatly intensified the phagocytic activity of macrophage. b Plaque forming cell test PFC This method is used to examine the effect of a substance to enhance the antibody producing ability due to the activation of B cells of the host amongst the immunomodulating actions. The RIN substance dissolved in a saline was administered intraperitoneally to a test group of six 4 week old femaleICR CRJ mice average weight, 20 g for 3 consecutive days.For the control group, only a saline was administered in the same manner. At the fourth day and also at the eleventh day, sheep red blood cells were injected into the tail vein 4x108 cells mouse to sensitize the mice. Four days after the injection, the plaque forming ability of the spleen cells of mice was determined by the method of Cunningham. The results are shown in the Table III. Table III Sensitization on Sensitization on Dose 4th days 11th day Sample mg kg Number of Relative Number of Relative Plaques Value Plaques Value per Spleen per Spleen Control x104 x104 Saline .2 100 2. 100 10 4.5 141 6.0 214RIN Sub 30 7.7 241 8.5 303 stance 100 7.1 222 8.0 286 It can be seen from the results shown in the Table III that the administration of the RIN substance in a dose of 10 to 100 mg kg greatly enhanced the antibody producing ability. c Delayed type hypersensitivity reaction DHR This method is used to examine the effect of a substance to enhance the action of cell mediated immunity due to the activation of T cells of the host amongst the immunomodulating actions. The RIN substance dissolved in a saline was administered orally to a test group of six 8 week old ICR CRJ mice female average weight 27 g for 8 consecutive days. For the control group, on the other hand, only a saline was administered in the same manner. At the fourth day from the administration, a 5 ethanol solution of picryl chloride was coated on the abdominal region which had been shaved to achieve a primary sensitization. At the eleventh day, a 1 olive oil solution of picryl was coated on the obverse and reverse side of the each ear of the mouse to accomplish a secondary sensitization. After 24 hours, an increase in the thickness of the ears was measured with a thickness gauge that is, the increase in the thickness of the ear was determined by measuring the difference in thickness between before coating and after coating.On the other hand, in the case of tumor bearing mice, Sarcoma 180 were transplanted intraperitoneally lx105 cells mouse prior to the administration of the RIN substance and, thereafter, the same procedure as above was repeated. The results are shown in the Table IV. Table IVSmaple Dose Normal Mice Tumor bearing mg kg Increase in Relative Increase in Relative Ear Thick Value Ear Thick Value ness lem ness ,us Control Saline 30.0 100 12.8 100 30 70.8 236 27.3 213RIN Sub 100 66.4 221 26.0 203 stance 500 60.2 201 20.6 161 It can be seen from the results shown in the Table IV that the RIN substance administered orally in a dose of 30 to 500 mg kg enhanced greatly the cell mediated immunity in the both case of normal and tumor bearing mice. After the RIN was administered orally for a certain period to tumor bearing rats, number of T cells in peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph node, and spleen increased significantly by the administration of the RIN. Concerning about the subset of T cells, helper T cells increased and suppressorT cells decreased. This fact also supports that the RIN substance enhances the T cell system. From the results of the above described tests a , b and c , it can be seen that the RIN substance enhances greatly various immunity actions having different mechanisms.The immunomodulating agent can be used in cases in which the immunity function falls down or the recognizing function against the foreign antigen is poor. Thus the RIN substance is expected to find uses as, for example, a therapeutic agent or an adjuvant therapeutic agent or a preventing agent or an agent for acceleration of recuperation after operation for infectious diseases and malignant tumors. In addition to the above described immunity activating or recovering capability, the immunomodulating agent may be used sometimes to normalize the abnormally stimulated immunity reaction for example, may be applied to self immunity diseases such as rheumatism, collagen diseases, and allergy. 3 Host defense activity It is well knwon that the host defense activities of living body against the bacterial infectious diseases are based on the following principles one is so called the humoral immunity depending on the production of antibody against the invaded bacteria and another is so called the cell mediated immunity in which macrophage and T cell fight against the invaded bacteria. In general, the living body has a sufficient host defense activities against the invasion of such foreign bacteria. However, it is well known that in the tumor bearing condition, particularly in the later stage of cancer, those activities fall down seriously, therefore, that the serious damage is caused even by some nonpathogenic bacteria usually living together in the host. In order to determine if the RIN substance enhances the host defense activities of the host against infectious diseases due to such bacteria, the inhibitory activity of the RIN substance against the infection of Escherichia coli, a typical infectious microorganism against which is said the humoral immunity might participiate, and against the infection of Listeria monocytogenes, which is said the cellmediated immunity might participate, are examined. Seven week old ICR CRJ mice female average weight 26 g were divided into four groups of 20 mice each. The RIN substance dissolved. in a saline was injected subcutaneously in the back of the mice in a dose of 10,. 3,0 or 100 mg kg, at one day before and one day after the infection. For the control group, only a saline was injected in the same manner.Then, in the case of E. coli, 2x107 cells mouse were infected subcutaneously in the back, and in the case of L. monocytogenes, 2x107 cells mouse were infected intraperitoneally. After one week, the number of survival was compared. The protective effect was calculated by the following equation Number of Number of survival in survival in Protective test group control group x 100 Effect Number of mice in one group The results are shown in the Table V.

Further, excellent effects were obserbed in case of the administration of the RIN substance after the infection. In view of the fact that the RIN substance is of no toxicity, this substance is expected to be a very useful host defense agent against infectious disease. 4 Inducing activity of tumor necrosis factor Female, 8 week old, ICR CRJ mice were injected intravenously with 3 mg mouse of Zymosan A Sigma Co. as a priming agent. At 7 days after the priming, 750 pg mouse of the RIN, or 25 ug mouse of LPS Difco Co., derived from E.coli as a positive control, was injected intravenously to these mice as an eliciting agent. At 90 minutes after the eliciting, blood was collected from venous plexus of retroorbit of the mice, centrifuged and sterilized by filtration to obtain activated serum. Thus the activated serum was submitted to the following tests. a in vitro cytocidal activity against L 929 cells Cytocidal activity of the activated serum against L 929 cells was measured by the following procedures L 929 cells prelabelled with 3H thymidine 5 pCi ml were cultivated in the presence of said serum for 24 hours at 370C in a CO2 incubator. Released 3H from the cells was measured with liquid scintillation counter. Eagle s MEM medium with 10 of fetal calf serum was used for cultivation and for dilution of the activated serum. The results are shown in the following Table VI. Table VI Eliciting Dose Cytocidal activity agent g mouse dilution fold of serum LPS 25 210 220 200 RIN 750 190 210 200 Cytocidal activity is indicated by the dilution fold of the serum which gives 30 death of the target cells. The table shows that the RIN induced cytotoxic factor as strong as LPS which was used as a positive control, when mice were primed with Zymosan A and elicited with the RIN substance. b Necrotizing activity against Meth A solid tumor To confirm that the cytocidal activity mentioned above was due to the tumor necrosis factor, in vivo test was performed. Meth A cells of 5x105 cells mouse were inoculated subcutaneously in 8 week old female BALB C CRJ mice. Seven days after the inoculation, 10 mice that had tumors reaching 7 mm in diameter with no spontaneous necrosis were selected and divided into 2 groups. Tumor bearing mice in each group were injected intravenously with 0.5 ml mouse of the serum with or without activation, and the changes appearing in the tumors were observed. Although no changes were observed in 5 mice of the control group, distinct hemorrhagic necrosis was observed in all 5 mice of the test group received the activated serum. c Endogenous induction of tumor necrosis factor in tumor bearing mice Meth A cells of 5x105 cells mouse were inoculated subcutaneously in 10 female mice of 8 week old BALB C CRJ. Two weeks after the inoculation, Zymosan A of 3 mg mouse was injected intravenously in the test group of 5 mice and 1 mg mouse of the RIN was injected intravenously one week afterZymosan A injection. Although no changes were observed and tumors grew steadily in 5 mice of the control group, distinct hemorrhagic necrosis within one week after the injection of the RIN was observed and growth of tumors was suppressed in all 5 mice of the test group. From the results shown in a , b and c , it might be concluded that the RIN has a strong inducing activity of tumor necrosis factor in mice and also has an activity inducing endogenous tumor necrosis factor in tumor bearing mice when used with a suitable priming agent. Therefore its antitumor activity might be expected. Because only such a toxic inducer of tumor necrosis factor as LPS has been known, it has not been possible to develop a useful way of utilization as a drug. But if such a non toxic substance like the RIN has an activity of inducing tumor necrosis factor, it might be very useful. On the other hand, following in vitro biological activities ofthe RIN substance were confirmed as evidences to support such in vivo biological activities as mentioned above when natural killer NK cells derived from mouse spleen were cultivated with YAC 1 cells target cells in the presence of the RIN, cytocidal activity of NK cells against target cells was enhanced significantlyrythe RIN cytocidal activity of resident peritoneal macrophage against L 929 cells was enhanced significantly in the presence of the RIN secretion of interleukins or prostaglandins was enhanced in the presence of the RIN substance. The acute toxicity of the RIN substance will hereinafter be described in detail. Ten 5 week old SD CRJ rats male weight 120 150 g were used in the control and test group respectively. TheRIN substance was administered orally once at the physically maximum dose of 15 g kg in the test group, and only a saline in the control group. No rat died. The increase of body weight in the test group was equal to that in the control group. Furthermore, no abnormality was observed in both appearance and necropsy. Thus it is considered that theLD50 of this substance is larger than 15 g kg and the substance has no acute toxicity. In accordance with the present invention, the polysaccharide RIN substance exhibiting superior antitumor, immunomodulating, host defense activity against infections desease, and inducing activity of tumor necrosis factor as described above can be obtained in a large amount, as demonstrated in Examples described hereinafter, by a combination of relatively easy procedures. Thus the present invention has a high practical value in the field of the commercial production of a polysaccharide having excellent biological activities from rice bran. Furthermore, since the RIN substance of the present invention is observed to haveaninterferon inducing ability, it is expected to have the preventing or treating effect against virus diseases such as herpes and influenza. Since the RIN substance can be administered both orally and non orally, it is expected to be a very useful antitumor, immunomodulating, infectious disease preventing or treating, or tumor necrosis factor inducing agent. In the practical form of the drug, the RIN substance can be produced singly or in combination with adjuvants e.g., water, saline, polyethylene glycol, glycerogelatin, starch, dextrin, lactose, etc. in the form of, e.g., liquid medicine, pellet, tablet, powder, suppository, etc. The present invention is described in detail with reference to the following examples.EXAMPLE 1 Tap water 125 liters was added to 25 kg of commercially available rice bran which had been separated from pulverized rice and so forth by passing through a screen. The mixture was extracted at 1200C for 1 hour and at 100C for 5 hours with constant stirring. The extract was then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under a reduced pressure to 40 liters. The thusconcentrated filtrate was adjusted to pH 6.7 with sodium hydroxide and, thereafter, 500 mg of an a amylase produced by Nagase Sangyo Co., Ltd. was added and an enzyme treatment was performed at 700C for 1 hour. After the enzyme treatment, the enzyme was inactivated by heating up to 1000C, and insolubles were removed by centrifugation. Ethanol was added to the final concentration of 30 v v . The precipitate formed was separated. This precipitate was dissolved again in water to remove insolubles. The soluble part was lyophilized and 508 g of a light yellow powder was obtained. Four grams of the said powder was dissolved again in ionexchanged water, and insolubles were removed by centrifugation.The soluble part was applied on a gel filtration of SepharoseCL 6B produced by Pharmacia Chemicals AB , and fractions eluted in the void volume were collected. The fractions were applied on an anion exchange column of DEAE Sepharose CL 6B, and the adsorbed portion was eluted with 0.1 N NaCl solution, and was collected. Said portion was concentrated, desalted by dialysis against a distilled water for 2 days. The thus obtained dialyzate was lyophilized to obtain 200 mg of a white powder.EXAMPLE 2 Commercially available rice bran 25 kg was defatted by ref fluxing with 100 liters of hexane and then dried. The defatted rice bran was then treated in the same manner as in Example 1 to obtain 450 g of a light yellow powder.Four grams of the said powder was treated in the same manner as in Example 1 to obtain 200 mg of a white powder.EXAMPLE 3 Commercially available defatted rice bran 3 kg was mixed with 20 liters of water, and the mixture was then extracted at 1200C for 2 hours with constant stirring. The extract was concentrated under a reduced pressure to obtain 5 liters of a concentrated solution. Then, 0.3 g of a crystalline a amylase produced by Nagase Sangyo Co., Ltd. was added to the solution, and it was maintained at 600C for 5 hours. Thereafter, the mixture was heated to 1000C and was subjected to centrifugation to get 4.9 liters of a supernatant. To the supernatant ethanol was added to the final concentration of 40 v v . The precipitate formed was separated and then lyophilized to obtain 88 g of a light yellow brown powder. Four grams of the said powder was treated in the same manner as in Example 1 to obtain 190 mg of a white powder.EXAMPLE 4 Commercially available rice bran 20 kg was passed through a 30 mesh screen to remove contaminants such as rice pieces, and then washed with 100 liters of ionexchanged water. Then, 50 liters of distilled water was added to the above washed rice bran, and the mixture was extracted at 1100C for 3 hours with constant stirring. The extract was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under a reduced pressure and centrifuged, whereupon 10 liters of a supernatant was obtained. Then, 250 mg of a crystalline a amylase was added to it and kept at 650C for 24 hours.The mixture was heated to 1000C. Ethanol was then added to the final concentration of 30 v v . The precipitate formed was separated. This precipitate was dissolved again in 3 liters of water, and insolubles were removed, and concentrated again under a reduced pressure to 1 liter, and centrifuged to get a supernatant. This supernatant was dialyzed for 2 days with running water and centrifuged to get 1 liter of a supernatant. To the supernatant 300 g of anion exchanger, DEAE Sepharose CL 6B, was added, and stirred slowly for 1 hour at a room temperature, and centrifuged to collect anion exchanger. Said anion exchanger was washed with a distilled water and was added 1 liter of 0.1 N NaCl solution and stirred slowly for another 1 hour to elute the adsorbate. Thereafter, anion exchanger was removed by centrifugation to get a supernatant.The supernatant was concentrated and lyophilized to obtain 50 g of a white powder.EXAMPLE 5 Activated carbon 10 g was added to 1 liter of a supernatant as obtained by dialysis and centrifugation in Example 4. After 30 minutes, the mixture was centrifuged. The thus obtained supernatant was subjected to the same ion exchanging and lyophilizing treatment as in Example 4 to obtain 30 g of a white powder.EXAMPLE 6 A 20 ml portion of 1 liter of a supernatant as obtained by dialysis and centrifugation in Example 4 was applied on gel filtration using Sepharose CL 6B, and void volume fractions were collected to make up 100 ml. This liquid was subjected to the same ion exchanging and lyophilizing treatment as in Example 1 to obtain 500 mg of a white powder.EXAMPLE 7 The precipitate obtained by the ethanol precipitation after an a amylase treatment in Example 1 was dissolved again in 10 liters of water. The solution was applied on an ultrafiltration to remove the low moleculare part lower than 80,000 molecular weight , and also to concentrate to 3 liters. The precipitate formed was removed by centrifugation, yielding 2.8 liters of a supernatant. This supernatant was subjected to the same ion exchanging and lyophilizing treatment as in Example 1 to obtain 120 mg of a white powder.EXAMPLE 8 To the solution subjected to the a amylase treatment followed by the inactivation of the enzyme at 1000C for 1 hour in Example 1 acetone was added to the final concentration of 40 v v . The precipitate formed was dissolved in 10 liters of water. Thereafter, the same procedure including the treatment using an ultrafilter as in Example 7 was applied to obtain 150 mg of a white powder.EXAMPLE 9 To the solution subjected to the a amylase treatment followed by the inactivation of the enzyme at 1000C for 1 hour in Example 1 ammonium sulfate was added to the degree of saturation of 70 to achieve salting out. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 3 liters of water, and dialyzedagainst a running water for 2 days. Trichloroacetic acid was added to the said solution to the concentration of 7 . The precipitate formed was removed by centrifugation. The thus obtained supernatant was dialyzed again against the running water for 2 days. The thus obtained dialyzate was lyophilized to obtain 503 g of a light yellow powder.Four grams of the powder was dissolved in ion exchanged water and then the same procedure including gel filtrating, ion exchanging and lyophilizing treatment as in Example 1 was applied to obtain 100 mg of a white powder.EXAMPLE 10 The solution subjected to the a amylase treatment inExample 1 was cooled to 400C, and 600 mg of a proteinase Pronase E, produced by Kaken Kagaku Co., Ltd. was then added and was allowed to react for 24 hours. The reaction mixture was heated at 1000C for 1 hour to inactivate the enzyme. Insolubles were removed by centrifugation. To the supernatant ethanol was added to the final concentration of 30 v v . The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation and then dissolved in 10 liters of water. Thereafter, the same procedure including the treatment using an ultrafilter as in Example 7 was applied to obtain 150 mg of a white powder.EXAMPLE 11 The supernatant 3 liters obtained in ultrafiltration conducted in the same manner as in Example 8 was admixed with anion exchange resin, Amberlite IR 4B OH type 500 g . The mixture was stirred for 1 hour at a room temperature, and filtered to recover the resin which was washed with distilled water 1 liter . The resin recovered was taken into 0.1 N aqueous NaC1 solution 2 liters and the solution mixture was stirred for 1 hour at a room temperature, so that substance adsorbed on the resin was eluted out. The solution mixture was filtered to remove the resin, thereby a supernatant solution was obtained. This solution 2 liters was lyophilized to give 15 g of a white powder.EXAMPLE 12 To the water soluble portion obtained by applying the ion exchanging treatment in Example 11, ethanol was added to the final concentration of 40 v v . The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation, washed and dehydrated three times with ethanol, and then dried in vacuo to obtain 13 g of a white powder. EXAMPLE 13 To the white powder 2 g obtained in Example 1, 2 aqueous sulfuric acid formic acid solution 100 ml was poured. The mixture solution was kept for 4 hours at 600C to hydrolyze the starting material. After completion of the hydrolysis, the reaction mixture was neutralized with barium carbonate and centrifuged to obtain a supernatant. One half of the supernatant thus obtained was subjected to gel filtration on a column filled with Sepharose CL 2B, thereby a fraction F1 having molecular weight of about 20,000,000 or more which eluted in a void volume and a fraction F2 having median molecular weight of about 1,000,000 were obtained. Another one half of the supernatant was subjected to gel filtration on a column filled with Sephadex G 200, thereby a fraction F3 having median molecular weight of about 100,000 and a fraction F4 having median molecular weight of about 10,000 were obtained. Each fraction was lyophilized and the fractions F1, F2,F3 and F4 gave white powder respectively in the following yield F1 380 mg, F2 255 mg, F3 273 mg, F4 255 mg. Each fraction thus obtained was examined for biological activities according to the method described in the detailed description of the invention . As apparent from the following results, each fraction exhibit biological activities comparable to the corresponding ones before hydrolysis. 1 Antitumor activity Activity against syngeneic tumor Meth A was examined.Each fraction was administered orally at a dose of 30 mg kg.The results are shown in the Table VII.
