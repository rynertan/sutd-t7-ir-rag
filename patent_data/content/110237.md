## Description
Binder and stapled sheet assembly thereof This invention relates to binders and more particularly to binders of the type adapted to receive a plurality of sheets which are secured in the binder in a condition to be individually viewed by fasteners, particularly staples. There are many situations where it is desired to retain a group of sheets in a binder so that the sheets will be held in a condition to be individually viewed. Such binders also usually provide front and rear covers for the sheets. The usual letter or legal size of paper sheets and covers provided therefor is such that ordinary desk staples cannot be used to effect securement of the sheets within the binder unless the staples are extended through the margin of the covers and sheets with the crowns and clinched legs secured against the exterior surfaces of the covers. This construction results in the staples being exteriorly exposed presenting the possibility that the staples, and particularly the clinched ends of the legs thereof, can become engaged.with other sheet like elements, causing inconvenience and sometimes unwanted problems. In order to effect staple securement interiorly of the covers it is necessary to have a deep throated stapling device such as utilized in printing shops, since the depth of the throat of the conventional desk stapler is simply not big enough. Because these deep throated staplers are not readily available, it has been the practice heretofore when interior securement is desired to utilize other types of paper fasteners. The most common fasteners utilized are of the type having flat double element shanks or the like which require that the papers be initially punched before securement can be effected. After being engaged through the preformed holes the flat double element shanks are bent over in opposite directions to effect final securement.The necessity to punch holes in the papers, align the holes, manually handle, insert and bend down each fastener individually is time consuming and inconvenient.Moreover, while the final assembly does not expose any fastener parts exteriorly, they are exposed interiorly. The use of staples and conventional desk stapling devices to effect securement obviates these inconveniences but presents the problem of exterior staple exposure, as aforesaid. In order to alleviate this latter problem it has been proposed to cover the exteriorly exposed staples with adhesive strips but this arrangement itself adds assembly time and further inconvenience and cost. It is an object of the present invention to provide a binder which will alleviate the above problem in a convenient and economical fashion. In accordance with the principles of the present invention this objective is obtained by providing a binder which preferably includes a front cover, a rear cover, front and rear fastener covering sections hinged to the front and rear covers respectively along first fold lines and front and rear fastener receiving sections hinged to the front and rear fastener covering sections respectively along second fold lines.Each of the fastener receiving sections has an outer surface and an opposed inner surface against which a margin of the sheets is retained by fastener means preferably in the form of a staple or staples extending through the margin of the sheets and the staple receiving sections with the fastener being secured against the outer surfaces of the fastener receiving sections. Each of the fastener covering sections is operable to be hinge with respect to the associated fastener receiving sections between a fastener attaching position extending away from the outer surface of the associated fastener receiving section so as to permit the securement of the fastener or staple as aforesaid and a fastener covering position wherein an inner surface thereof is disposed in abutting relation to the outer surface of the associated fastener receiving section.A conveniently activatable adhesive means, preferably a coating of pressure sensitive adhesive having a detachable masking stro initially covering the same, is operable between the inner surface of each fastener covering section and the outer surface of the associated fastener receiving section after the fastener or staple has been secured through the fastener receiving sections with the fastener covering sections in their fastener attaching positions as aforesaid, and the fastener covering sections have been moved into their fastener covering positions for adhesively retaining the fastener covering sections in their fastener covering positions.Preferably the covers and sections of the binder are formed integrally from one sheet of material with the front and rear fastener receiving sections being hinged iterchnnected along a common fold line which is parallel to te fold lines associated with the fastener covering sections. Another object of the present invention is the provision of an assembly embodying a binder of the type described in cooperative relation with a plurality of sheets and a staple which is simple in ccnstruction, economical to manufacture and effective in operation. These and other objets of the present invention will become more apparent during the course of the following detailed description and a enc d claims. The invention may best be understood with reference to the accompanying raings, s herein an illustrative embodiment is show In the drawings Figure 1 is a perspective view of a binder embodying the principles of the present invention showing the same in a position intermediate its initial position and its final assembly position Figure 2 is an end view illustrating the binder in its initial position with a plurality of sheets mounted therein illustrating the manner in which the staples are mounted in securing relation with respect to the sheets and binder Figure 3 is an enlarged fragmentary sectional view illustrating the binder in its finally assembled position and Figure 4 is a fragmentary sectional view taken along the line 4 4 of Figure 3. Referring now more particularly to the drawings, there is shown in Figure 1 thereof a binder embodying the principles of the present invention which consists essentially of front and rear covers I and 2 joined by a back 3. In the embodiment shown the entire binder has been cut from one sheet of material or blank. A longitudinal fold 4 defining two staple receiving sections is formed in the back 3 by a rear fold line 5 extending throughout the central portion thereof. As best shown in Figure 2, the documents or plurality of sheets 19 which are to be retained in the binder are inserted into the fold 4 so that the front and rear sheets abut the inside surfaces of the staple receiving section of the fold along their marginal edge portions.After the sheets 19 have been inserted into the fold 4 as aforesaid, one or preferably three staples 20 are driven and clinched through the staple receiving sections of the fold 4 and the margins of the sheets 19. Figure 1 illustrates in dotted lines the ideal positions 16, 17 and 18 for the staples. As best shown in Figure 4, it will be noted that the crown of each staple 20 engages the opposite outer surface of the forward staple receiving section defined by the fold 4 while the opposite outer surface of the rear staple receiving section of the fold 4 has the free ends of the legs of the staples clinched into engagement therewith. In the embodiment shown, the binder also includes front and rear staple covering sections 12 and 13 respectively which must be hinged or folded back onto the corresponding sections of the fold 4. The front and rear staple covering sections, in addition to being hinged to the respectively front and rear staple receiving sections of the fold 4, are also hinged to the front and rear covers 1 and 2 respectively. As shown, fold lines 6 and 7 define parallel edges of the front staple covering section 12 and serve to hinge the section 12 to the associated section of the fold 4 and the front cover 1, respectively, Similarly, fold lines 8 and 9 define parallel edges of the rear staple covering section 13 and serve to hinge the section 13 to the associated section of the fold 4 and rear cover 2 respectively.The hinging action provided by the fold lines enables the staple covering sections to be moved between staple attaching positions shown in Figure 2 wherein the same extend away from the outer surface of the adjacent sections of the fold 4 so as to permit the staples to be driven through the latter and fastener covering positions wherein an inner surface of the staple covering sections 12 and 13 are disposed in abutting relation to the outer surfaces of the associated staple receiving sections of the fold 4. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the inner surfaces of the staple covering sections 12 and 13 have a pressure sensitive adhesive coating 10 and 11 respectively applied thereto.The exposed surfaces of the adhesive coatings 10 and 11 are protected by detachable masking fpils or strips 15 and 16 respectively. After stapling the plurality of papers 19 within the fold 4, as shown in Figure 2, the assembly is completed by first removing the masking foils 14 and 15 exposing the pressure sensitive adhesive coatings 10 and 11. The staple covering sections 12 and 13 are then hinged or folded back along fold lines 6 and 8 into their staple covering positions wherein the pressure sensitive adhesive coatings on the inner surface thereof engage the abutting outer surface of the staple receiving sections of the fold 4 so as to effect an adhesive securement of the surfaces in abutting relation and to firmly retain the staple covering sections in covering relation to the associated exposed portions of the staples engaged with the inner surfaces of the staple receiving sections of fold 4. The binder is normally sold folded solely along fold line 5. Sections 12 and 13 are hinged along their fold lines 6, 7, 8 and 9 just prior or subsequent to the stapling of the papers to the fold 4, as shown inFigure 2, by hinging or folding the same along the fold lines 6, 7, 8 and 9. It thus will be seen that the objects of this invention have been fully and effectively accomplished.It will be realized, however, that the foregoing preferred specific embodiment has been shown and described for the purpose of illustrating the functional and structural principlesof this invention and is subject to change without departure from such principles. Therefore, this invention includes all modifications encompassed within the spirit and scope of the following claims.
