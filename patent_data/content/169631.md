# MANUFACTURE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CABLE CORE UNITS

## Abstract
Changing relative positions of conductor pairs 10 along a telecommunications cable core 56 by passing the pairs as they approach a core unit forming means 34 , in an array through a flow of air which causes relative sideways movement of the pairs and continual change in their positions. The array may be arcuate, conveniently circular, and the airflow moves outwardly from within the array. Alternatively, the array is primarily planar with the airflow moving from one side of the array.
