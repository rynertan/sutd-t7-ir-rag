# Fuel element assembly.

## Abstract
A tight lattice fuel element assembly 20 for a pressurized water cooled nuclear converter reactor includes a plurality of nuclear fuel elements 40 disposed in parallel, and forming a plurality of longitudinal flow channels 60 , in a closely packed array. Axially spaced longitudinal fins 40 formed integrally on at least some of the fuel elements, at an angle with the fuel element axis, serve to divert coolant flowing longitudinally past the fuel elements between adjacent flow channels to promote mixing and even heating of the coolant. Each fin traverses the clearance between adjacent fuel elements, tangentially contacts the body of an adjacent fuel element, and is fixedly connected thereto. Sets of the axially spaced fins are fixedly connected to adjacent fuel elements, as described, in substantially the same transverse plane relative to the longitudinal axis of the fuel assembly. At the leading end of the fins, the relative flow rate diverted from adjacent flow channels alternates and at the trailing end of the fins, the relative flow rate conveyed to adjacent flow channels also alternates moreover, in a given flow channel the number of flow streams diverted and converged, at the leading and trailing fin edges, also alternates.
