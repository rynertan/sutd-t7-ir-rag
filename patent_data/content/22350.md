# Tire press and method.

## Abstract
A tire curing press and method are characterized by a center mechanism 48 operative first to center the top bead of a green tire carcass with respect to the top mold section 42 and then the bottom bead with respect to the bottom mold section 44 , and to hold the beads centered and axially separated as the press closes to cause the beads to register and seat with the toe rings of the top and bottom mold section simultaneously as the press closely approaches its closed condition. The center mechanism comprises top and bottom segmented annular clamping rings 52 adapted to engage and shape the axial interior of the bead area of the tire and respective chuck assemblies including a multi faceted linear cam 102 and respective followers 64, 66 for each ring segment 54, 56 operative to collapse each alternate ring segment 54 and then each other ring segment 56 . The clamping rings achieve automatic loading, centering and unloading and may be used individually or paired in bladder or bladderless curing.
