# Catalysts useful for preparing polyamides.

## Abstract
A polyamide is produced by polymerizing at least one of alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid, an ammonium salt of an alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid, an alpha, beta unsaturated nitrile and water, a beta amino propionic acid or alkyl derivative thereof and an alpha, beta unsaturated amide and ammonia in the presence of a catalyst containing cobalt. Preferred catalysts comprise cobaltous carboxylates and cobaltic salts of the enol of beta di ketones.
