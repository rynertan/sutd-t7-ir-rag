## Description
DESCRIPTION TRACTION PRESSURE CONTROL SYSTEM This invention relates to variable drive transmissions of the traction gear type, and in particular to regulation of the surface contact pressure between the traction gear elements therein for slip control purposes. Most traction type transmissions involve the use of an overbundance of contact pressure between the traction gear elements to insure that no excessive slip occurs despite the use of a variety of techniques to vary or adjust the contact pressure. According toUnited States Patent No. 3,745,844, for example, slippage is measured through a hydromechanical arrangement relying on the final transmission gear ratio and output torque, to produce a signal designed to increase contact pressure and ultimately eliminate all slippage.Although the foregoing prior art arrangement represents an effort to minimise pressures on the traction gear elements and reduce radial bearing loads, a gross analogue approach is relied upon not capable of achieving the precise operations necessary for optimising traction conditions. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided in combination with a transmission having input and output members, traction drive elements in engagement with each other under a surface contact pressure to establish a power transmitting path between said input and output members and drive ratio control means operative through said traction drive elements to change the drive ratio of the transmission, the improvement residing in control means for varying the surface contact pressure, including means for monitoring the drive ratio control means and the actual speed ratios between said input and output members, said processing means connected to said monitoring means for calculating the slippage between said traction drive elements for each of the drive ratios of the transmission, memory means for storing empirical data representing optimum slippage for each of the drive ratios, comparator means connected to said memory means and the data processing means for producing a corre,ctive output signal and servo means connected to said comparator means for adjusting the contact pressure in response to said corrective output signal. Logic controlled means are also provided in the data processor for establishing an initial contact pressure for a neutral, no load condition of the transmission of zero slip to permit the system to monitor relative speeds and thereby identify the exact location of contact upon initial start up. Precision manufacturing, assembly and maintenance problems and associated sync errors are thereby avoided. The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which like numerals refer to like parts throughout, and in which Figure 1 is a schematic illustration showing a system embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a graph illustrating the manner in which empirical data is obtained for use in the system depicted in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a circuit diagram illustrating the details of the control unit shown in Figure 1 Figure 4 is a schematic illustration of a modified version of the system shown in Figure 1 Figure 5 is another graph showing the manner in which empirical data is obtained. Figure 1 schematically illustrates a traction gear type of transmission 10 having an input shaft 12 and an output shaft 14. The drive ratio of the transmission is varied in response to shift of a traction gear element by a drive ratio control component 16. The surface contact pressure between the engaging traction gear elements, is controlled by a contact pressure control component 18. The transmission of power to the output shaft 14 from an engine connected to the transmission through input shaft 12, may be selectively interrupted by means of a drive enabling control assembly 20 associated with the transmission 10. Transmissions of this type are already known as disclosed, for example, in my prior copending United States Patent ApplicationsSerial Nos. 716,341 and 787,372, respectively filedAugust 20, 1976, and April 14, 1977. Also, previously known in the art are transmission control systems, such as the microprocessor unit 22 diagrammed in Figure 1 from which commands are fed through line 24 to the drive ratio control 16 for automatically varying the drive ratio and establishing the desired condition in the drive enabling control 20 through line 26. Input data to the unit 22 is obtained from an input speed sensor 28 and an output speed sensor 30, respectively associated with the input and output shafts. These sensors may be e.g. of the mechanical breaker contact, electro optical or magnetic pickup type from which signal pulses are generated and fed to unit 22 by signal input lines 32 and 34.Thus, the speed signals as well as other factors slouch as engine throttle, cylinder vacuum and control lever position may be processed by unit 22 to supply commands through output lines 24 and 26 to control operation of the transmission in a manner appropriate for propulsion of an automotive vehicle The surface contact pressure is controlled through the contact pressure control 18 by establishing a pressure through signal line 26 for initial startup positional computation under no load no slip conditions and varied by a servo 36 receiving servo commands through line 38 from a traction pressure control unit 40 to which the speed signal lines 32 and 34 are connected. The condition of the drive enabling control 20 is monitored through sensor 44 connected by signal line 46 to the unit 40 and through an overload sensor 48 to the servo 36.Output signal line 26 from the unit 22 to drive enabling control 20 is also connected to control unit 40. Finally, the condition of the drive ratio control 16 is monitored through signal line 50 connected to the control unit 40. The control unit 40 is operative to control the slip between the traction gear elements of the transmission so as to optimise traction or provide the best power transfer capacity under minimum loading and hence the longest service life for components by varying the pressure. The ratio of input and output speeds of shafts 12 and 14 are compared with the drive ratio setting of the transmission for digitally computing actual slippage at all times under varying load conditions within the transmission drive ratio range. Contact pressure is continuously adjusted by comparison of the computed slippage with slippage derived from an optimum slip curve empirically determined for the traction component geometry associated with the particular transmission. The empirical slip curve data is stored in a programmable read only memory PROM within a control loop to produce the necessary signal commands for adjusting the contact pressure so as to bring the computed slippage into line with optimum values corresponding to the stored empirical data The graph of Figure 2 illustrates the manner in which the empirical data aforementioned is obtained.A typical traction curve 52 is shown plotted from simultaneous traction transfer torque and percent slippage measurements made on a transmission under laboratory test loading and contact pressures independently applied to achieve the desired slippages. As noted in Figure 2, the traction torque increases from 0 to 0.5 slip as a substantially linear function of slippage up to a maximum value at load point 54. From about 0.5 to 1.5 slip, the transmitted torque remains substantially constant to establish a control range 56 and then begins a decrease with increased slip. Testing is performed at, and control ranges 56 plotted for, different ratio setting of the transmission as depicted in the graph of Figure 5. Thus, a control range 56 of slip may be empirically determined for each drive ratio and the contact pressure adjusted to maintain actual slip at some value within the optimum control range empirically determined for the particular drive ratio from a nominal slip curve 57 as shown in Figure 5. Figure 3 illustrates one method of implementing the invention. Clock pulses of 100 MHz, for example, are provided by a common base oscillator 58 for the control unit 40 and fed to scaler devices 60 and 62 to which the input and output speed signal lines 32 and 34 are connected. The outputs of the scaler devices 60 and 62 are fed to converter units 64 and 66 also driven by the clock pulses to provide converted speed signal pulses in lines 68 and 70 reflecting transmission input and output speeds. Lines 68 and 70 being connected to the input terminals of comparator 72 produce a speed ratio output in line 74 fed to one of the inputs of a comparator 76.Comparator 76 compares the actual speed ratio with information stored in memory 78 and fed by line 80 to the other input of comparator 76 to produce an output in line 82 indicative of slippage for a particular drive ratio at which the transmission is set. The information stored in memory 78 corresponds to drive ratios computed without slippage and is read out through line 80 in response to input from line 50 through which the drive ratio setting of the drive ratio control 16 is monitored. A sealer device 84 updates the read out of memory 80 in accordance with changes in drive ratio. The output in line 82 is operative through a correction slip comparator 86 to drive the servo 36 for effecting a change in contact pressure.The computed slippage signal in line 82 is, however, compared with the empirically determined peak efficiency data hereinbefore discussed with respect to Figures 2 and 5, stored in memory 88 and read out in response to the input in line 80. Thus, the output of comparator 86 will operate servo 36 in order to adjust contact pressure when the digitally computed slip deviates from the empirical optimum slip. The foregoing description of the control unit 40 explains operation under running conditions with the rdnuclio i nn ir. cj ar . MJring nrjrTr l start up, the drive enabling control 20 . oads the transmission under command of a zero demand signal in line 26 from the unit 22. The zero demand signal is also applied to the contact pressure control 18 as shown in Figure l to establish a preselected nominal pressure under neutral transmission conditions to ensure zero slip during calculating operations. In the neutral condition, line 90 connected to sensor 44 conducts gating pulses to logic 94.The gating pulses on line 90 represent the actual unloaded transmission output speed determined from a fixed gear ratio between the drive enabling control 20 and the output shaft 14. These gating pulses are counted by logic 94 enabled by the zero demand signal in line 26. At the same time, unit 22 feeds commands through line 24 to the drive ratio control 16 to upshift the transmission toward a high forward speed until the pulse rate of the signal pulses in line 90 increases to a point satisfying logic 94. An enabling signal is then generated and applied to sealer 89. Upshift operation of the drive ratio control 16 then stops. In this manner, an initial drive ratio is established corresponding to zero slippage occurring under the nominal contact pressure established for no load or neutral conditions.Also, accurate zeroing calculations are assured by performing computations at a low coupling ratio through the transmission. When the pulse rate of the signal in line 90 is at or above the preset point aforementioned, unit 40 begins timing the gating pulses in line 90 by comparison with the converted input speed signal received from enabled scaler 89 and converter 91 through comparator 92 until a parity counter 96 is satisfied to establish a stabilised drive ratio read out from memory 78 through line 80 to supply an equivalent output speed signal to comparator 76 for establishing tie aforementioned initial contact pressure in the neutral condition of the transmission. The memory 78 is of the programmable read only type containing data of gear ratios in relation to the relative drive ratio determining positions of the engaging traction elements in the transmission. This data is based on fixed gear radii functions excluding slip under load for the particular transmission.The computed drive ratio data is addressed to in memory 78 by the output of comparator 92 and the information fed to sealer device 84 to select the stored drive ratio data to be read out for comparison with the actual speed ratio output in line 74 from comparator 72. Any overload condition felt by the drive enabling control 20 is detected by sensor 98 as shown inFigure 1 to disable the servo 36 and thereby prevent any increase in contact pressure. Also, the components 64, 66, 84 and 94 as shown in Figure 3 are provided with pre settable means to provide unit 40 with sequence events data and safety interlock capacity. A simplified version of the system depicted in Figures 1 and 3 is shown in Figure 4. The transmission includes input.shaft 12 driving a traction gear element 100 that is slidably displaceable along shaft 12 by means of a drive ratio control 16 which includes a rotatable screw shaft 102, an axially shiftable nut element 104 on which the gear element 100 is carried and a sensor 106 mounted on the screw shaft for monitoring the axial position of the gear element 100 along a cone gear element 105 with which the gear element 100 is in engagement. The cone gear element 108 is rotatably mounted by and fixed to shaft 110 which may be pivotally displaceable under a force exerted by servo 36 to adjust the contact pressure between the engaging gear elements 100 and 108.A disengageable gear type of drive enabling control 20 drivingly interconnects the input shaft 12 and shaft 110 to the output shaft 14 . Speed sensors 28 and 30 are associated with shafts 12 and 110 respectively to supply speed signals to the traction control unit 40 . In Figure 4, the components of the control unit 40 responsible for automatic zeroing operation as hereinbefore described with respect to Figures 1 and 3, are simplified. The drive ratio setting or axial position of gear element 100 is monitored by sensor 106 to supply signal pulses to memory 78 to which input speed signals are fed from sensor 28 in order to read out stored information selected by the drive ratio signal from sensor 105 based on gear ratio computations as aforementioned in connection with memory 78.Zeroing calculations may be made at any ratio setting because the same positive and acceptable coupling ratio exists regardless of the over all transmission drive ratio. Thus, at start up, only somc nominal contact pressure is applied by servo 36 to ensure zero slip in the no load neutral condition,Once the measured ratio identifies the exact location of the traction gear element 100, shift pulses from sensor 106 will update the output of memory 78 as the correct zero slip for the new ratio setting. The output from memory 78 Is compared with the output speed signal from sensor 30 in comparator 76 to produce a digitally computed slip signal fed to one input of comparator 86 . The othel input of comparator 86 receives a signal from memory 88 within which the empirical data is stored as indicated with respect to memory 88 in Figure 3. The data read out from memory 88 corresponds tithe drive ratio setting of the transmission by virtue of the signal fed thereto by sensor 106. Thus, the output of comparator 86 will be operative through servo 36 to effect continuous adjustment of the contact pressure when the transmission is in gear as hereinbefore described with respect toFigures 1 and 3. The arrangement shown in Figure 4 is, however, somewhat modified in that the output speed signal from sensor 30 directly measures the speed of driven cone element 108 rather than the output shaft 14 . It will be appreciated that although the present invention has been described above with reference to a digital implementation thereof, an analog implementation of the optimum slip control loop using analog amplifiers and comparators is also possible.
