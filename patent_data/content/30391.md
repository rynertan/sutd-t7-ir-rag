# Method for producing L glutamic acid by fermentation and a method for producing a new microorganism.

## Abstract
A method for producing L glutamic acid by fermentation is provided, comprising culturing in a culture medium an L glutamic acid producing microorganism of the genus Escherichia. According to this method a microorganism is cultered which is obtained by incorporating into a recipient strain of the genus Escherichia a hybrid plasmid having inserted therein a DNA fragment with the genetic information controlling the L glutamic acid production, which fragment is derived from a donor strain of the genus Escherichia which is capable of producing L glutamic acid. The invention further comprises a method for producing a new microorganism of the genus Escherichia having high productivity for L glutamic acid, according to which chromosomal DNA is obtained from a mutant strain of the genus Eschierichia which is capable of producing L glutamic acid, the obtained DNA is treated with a restriction endonuclease to obtain the DNA fragment with the genetic information responsible for the L glutamic acid synthesis, the DNA fragment is inserted into a plasmid obtained from a microorganism of the genus Eschierichia and the recombinant plasmid is incorporated into a microorganism of the genus Escherichia as a recipient organism.
