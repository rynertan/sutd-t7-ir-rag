# Conductive resin composition and information record.

## Abstract
A conductive resin composition comprising a specific type of graft polymer of vinyl chloride and a vinyl chloride ac rylic ester copolymer, and a conductive powder used in an amount of from 10 to 30 wt of the graft polymer. The con ductive composition is particularly useful as video or digital audio discs.
