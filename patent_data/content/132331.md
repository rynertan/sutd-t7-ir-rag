# Securing assembly.

## Abstract
A locking and securing means 10 is disclosed which in cludes a base member 12 , a threaded member 14 and a sprocket 16 . The base member 12 defines vertically extend ing fingers 26, 29 with gaps 28, 35 therebetween and a threaded bore 20 . The threaded member 14 with a flat 40 or irregular shape on its upper leg segment 36 extends through this bore 20 to a desired position. The sprocket 16 , which is mounted on the threaded member 14 prior to inser tion into the bore 20 , has radially extending teeth 48 to mesh with the base member defined gaps 28, 35 and an in ternal shape to mate with the threaded member shape. The threaded member 14 is thus secured to a fixed height or po sition.
