# Automatic chemical analyzer.

## Abstract
An automatic chemical analyzer which comprises a reaction line system 1 including a plurality of reaction lines 1 to 16 each consisting of a plurality of reaction tubes 1A arranged in a row, means for distributing samples to the reaction tubes 1A , and means for carrying out chemical analysis of samples contained in the reaction tubes 1A . The reaction line system 1 is provided with a driving mechanism for driving the individual reaction lines intermit tently and independently of one another, and is constructed to sure that the feed rate of the individual reaction lines can be freely changed. The automatic chemical analyzer can thus be reduced in size and nevertheless can quickly and reliably make analysis of a number of samples for a number of items.
