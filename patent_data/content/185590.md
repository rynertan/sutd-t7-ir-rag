# A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF A LAMINATED FILM

## Abstract
The invention provides a method for the preparation of a laminate of a polyimide resin film and a film of a fluorocar bon resin such as a copolymeric resin of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene very firmly bonded together. The inventive method comprises subjecting the surface of each of the polyimide and fluorocarbon resin films to a treatment with low temperature plasma of an inorganic gas before press bonding the films at an elevated temperature. It is preferable that the thus prepared laminate is further sub jected to a heal treatment under a tensioned condition at a temperature higher than the softening point of the fluorocar bon resin so that the laminate can no longer be separated by peeling into the base films of the polyimide and fluorocarbon resins.
