# MACHINE FOR AND METHOD OF COATING PLASTIC CONTAINERS

## Abstract
Liquid coatings are applied to cylindrical articles 26 such as plastic containers, in which each article during movement by a rotary transport is caused to spin about its cylindrical axis by a drive 45, 20 for the container holding rotatable chucks. A liquid coating is applied by an applicator 60, 61 to the cylindrical surface of the spinning container. A wiper 70 spreads the coating uniformly and a drier 80 dries the coating. The ratio of the speed of orbital movement of the containers and the rate and direction of spin of the containers is adjustably controllable.
