# A process for extruding ethylene polymers.

## Abstract
A process comprising forming an extrudate, preferably in the form of a film, from an ethylene polymer which melts rapidly and experiences slow shear thinning by melt extrud ing said polymer through an extruder having an extrusion screw 3 therein with a length A to diameter B ratio of between about 15 1 to 21 1.
