# Level detector.

## Abstract
For detecting whether an input signal is above or below a reference level in such a way that brief signal interruptions and negative spurious pulses are not interpreted as de creases below the reference level, the detector comprises an input comparator 1 , a first delay circuit 5 , a second delay circuit 10 and an output circuit. The first delay circuit 5 comprises a first integrator comprising a first transistor T₂ and a first capacitor 8 , a first current source 7 and a second comparator T₃ . The second delay circuit 10 comprises a second integrator comprising a second transis tor T₄ and a second capacitor 13 , a second current source 12 and a third comparator T₅ . The first delay circuit 5 and the second delay circuit 10 have equal delay times. In order to ensure that during detection of a decrease below the reference level a positive spurious pulse is not interpreted as an increase above the reference level a third Transistor T₆ connects a third current source 30 in parallel with the first current source 7 of the first delay circuit when the input signal lies below the reference level, so that the delay time of the first delay circuit 5 becomes smaller than that of the second delay circuit 10 .
