# A process for improving the quality of whey protein.

## Abstract
The quality of whey protein is improved by maintaining a whey protein solution at a pH of from 8.5 to 11.5 and at a temperature of from 35 to 50 C, and thereafter adding to the solution a mixture of at least one acid selected from citric acid, phosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid, phytic acid and oxalic acid with at least one acid selected from hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid and maleic acid so as to adjust the pH of the solution to 6 8. The process of the invention, may be employed to obtain a whey protein having improved breaking strength and texture.
