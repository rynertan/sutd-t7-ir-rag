# Colostomy pouch.

## Abstract
A colostomy pouch comprises a main part and a space separated there from by a partition 13 and containing a filter material, such as active carbon 20 . The main space is provided with an inlet aperture 11 for tightly sealing the pouch to an abdominal opening, and between said main space and said separate space there is provided an aperture 14 in the partition 13 to conduct gases from said main space to said separate space where the gases, while passing through the active carbon 20 , are conducted to a gas exhausting aperture. Gas perme able porous material 19 may be provided in connection with the aperture 14 in the partition 13 and the gas exhausting aper ture.

## Description
COLOSTOMY POUCH The present invention relates to colostomy pouch of a material impervious to gas and liquid and having an inlet aperture or an indication for such inlet aperture, means for tightly sealing said aperture to an abdominal opening, and a venting aperture for exhausting gas. In colostomy pouches of this type, a small aperture is made upon application of the pouch so that gas collected in the pouch during use thereof can leak out. However, such gas leakage causes considerable discomfort to the wearer who does not know when gas leakage will occur, resulting in the spreading of offensive odours. To solve this problem, filter cartridges or capsules filled with active carbon have been developed which are intended to be placed over the gas exhausting aperture. Although the spreading of offensive odours is prevented in this manner, there is one further aspect to the application of the pouch, and this is the attachment of the filter cartridge, which may be difficult for older people. In addition, a cartridge of this type makes the colostomy pouch rather expensive. The present invention has for its object to provide a novel type of colostomy pouch which can be applied in a simple manner and requires no special filter cartridge and also can be produced at low cost. To this end, the pouch comprises a space which is separated from the main part of said pouch by a partition and which has a gas exhausting aperture or indication for such aperture, showing where pouch material should be removed to form said gas exhausting aperture, and which contains a filter material, such as active carbon and that said venting aperture is provided or can be provided in said partition at a distance from said gas exhausting aperture and said indication, respectively. The invention will be described in more detail in the following, reference being had to the accompanying drawings in which Figs. 1 3 illustrate, schematically and in vertical projection, three different embodiments of the invention. In the drawing, 10 is a colostomy pouch of gas and liquid impermeable material, preferably medical quality PVC. The pouch has an inlet aperture 11 or an indication showing where an inlet aperture is to be made upon application of the pouch. Around the inlet aperture 11 there is provided, in conventional manner, a sealing material 12 or like arrangement by which the pouch can be tightly sealed to an abdominal opening which, in its turn, communicates with the small or the large intestine. There are different ways in which this sealing can be effected, but since this has nothing to do with the present invention, it is merely pointed out that the pouch 10 can be tightly sealed to the abdominal opening by means of the arrangement 12.In the embodiment according to Fig. 1, a partition 13 extends between two adjacent edges of the rectangular pouch, defining a triangular space in connection with the pouch corner located between the said edges. The partition 13 is readily established by welding together the front and rear sides of the pouch. The partition 13 has an aperture 14 which is produced simply by exempting this place from welding. Adjacent the said pouch corner, an indication 15 is provided to show that this corner is to be removed upon application of the pouch 10. The space defined by the partition 13 and the pouch walls is filled with a filter material 20, especially active carbon, with the exception of those places in which the aperture 14 in the partition 13 and the indication 15 have been made and which, instead, are provided with gas permeable porous material 19, such as cotton wool. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, a partition 16 extends in parallel with one short side of the pouch and at a distance therefrom to form an elongate rectangular space separated from the main part of the pouch 10. The partition 16 is provided, like the partition 13, simply by welding together the opposite sides of the pouch 10, except for one place forming a through aperture 17 in the partition 16. The aperture 17 in the partition 16 is provided adjacent one pouch corner, whereas the opposite pouch corner has an indication 18 which, like the indication 15, is intended to show that this corner should be removed.As in the embodiment previously described, the space defined by the partition 16 is filled with active carbon 20, with th exception of those places adjacent the aperture 17 and indication 18 where gaspermeable porous material 19 has been provided instead. Fig. 3 illustrates an embodiment of the colostomy pouch which resembles the one shown in Fig. 2, but has a partition 21 extending along three sides of the pouch and defining an elongate conduit along these sides, said conduit accommodating the filter material 20. Initially, the partition may be perforated to form the venting aperture at one end of the conduit, while the opposite end of said conduit may open to the atmosphere, although said conduit preferably is closed both towards the interior of the pouch and to the atmosphere. The venting aperture preferably is established by means of a cord 25 extending from the conduit through the partition, through the interior space of the pouch and outward through the inlet aperture 11 so that it can be grasped. Within the conduit, the cord end is connected with a plastic tab 24 or the like.By pulling on the cord, the plastic tab is pulled through the partition and forms the venting aperture. As in the embodiments previously described, the pouch corner is provided with an indication showing how this corner should be cut off to form the gas ex hausting aperture. Instead of using the cord 25 and the plastic tab 24, it is also possible to thrust into the pouch a suitable tool to pierce the partition and form the venting aperture. Applying the pouch according to the invention is extremely simple. Thus, the user merely has to expose or cut open the aperture 11 in conventional manner and then, by a pair of scissors or a knife, to cut off one pouch corner along the indications 15 and 18, whereupon the pouch is ready for use. Instead of removing the corner along the indications 15 and 18, it is, of course, also possible to perforate the pouch material by means of a needle or the like adjacent the corner. In any case, using the colostomy pouch according to the present invention is extremely simple since the exact perforation of the pouch material which is required in connection with filter cartridges is no longer necessary. Besides, a space provided in this manner and filled with active carbon not only eliminates offensive odours, but also provides for an advantageous equalization of pressure. In addition to active carbon and porous material, the said space may contain a deodorizing substance. It will be readily understood that the present invention can be modified in different ways regarding both its shape and the arrangement of the separate space which is filled with filter material. The easiest way in which this space is provided has been described above, but it is also possible to dispose between the pouch sides a cord or a thin strip having one or more apertures at suitable locations, and tightly to connect the pouch sides with the opposite side faces of the cord or strip, for example by welding. In other words, the invention is not restricted to the embodiments described above and illustrated in the drawings, but can be modified in several ways within the scope of the appended claims.
