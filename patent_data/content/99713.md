# A method for protecting tuyères for refining a molten iron.

## Abstract
Wear of tuyeres for refining a molten iron is prevented by blowing a CO containing gas having the defined flow amount, oxygen gas flow amount and CO gas concentration as a shrouding gas which surrounds a core refining gas flow containing oxygen gas through tuyeres of concentric pipes. As the shrouding gas for cooling and protecting the tuyeres, use may be made of an exhaust gas discharged and recovered from a converter or a blast furnace by controlling the concentrations of CO and N₂ in the exhaust gas to the specific limitations.
