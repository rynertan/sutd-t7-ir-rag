## Description
This invention relates to an aqueous alkali soluble temporary protective coating composition suitable for spraying onto a surface liable to deteriorate through exposure to weather or abrasion. Many surfaces are liable to deteriorate when they are exposed directly to the atmosphere, for example due to humid conditions. These surfaces may be, for example, of finished articles or of articles which are at an intermediate or semi finished stage of manufacture and to which it is not appropriate to apply a permanent coating in order to prevent deterioration. Typical surfaces which are liable to deteriorate are those comprising a ferreous metal such as steel and galvanised steel, copper and aluminium whether painted or unpainted. Deterioration may be due, for example, to the oxidation of a metal surface, for example the rusting of ferreous surfaces or the formation of an oxide layer on an aluminium surface, or to the atmospheric weathering of painted surfaces. Painted or polished surfaces may also be damaged by abrasion, for example at an intermediate stage of manufacture. Typical materials which have been applied to these surfaces as temporary protective coatings in order to prevent deterioration or damage due to abrasion include oils, greases, waxes and solvent based lacquers. A temporary protective coating, together with any adhering contamination, may be removed with aqueous alkali when it is no longer required and may, if necessary, then be replaced by a fresh coating suitable to its future use. Alkali soluble polymers, particularly carboxyl group containing addition polymers, are known to be useful as temporary, protective coatings for surfaces. These are usually applied to a surface from a non aqueous solution or from an aqueous emulsion by spraying. The resulting coating may be subsequently removed by treatment with aqueous alkali, for example an alkaline cleaning solution of conventional formulation. More particularly United States patent 4 017 662 discloses polishes applicable to a surface by means of a cloth, brush or mop where the polish comprises an aqueous dispersion of discrete particles of a carboxylic acid copolymer optionally containing copolymerised non acidic hydrophilic comonomers. However, aqueous dispersions usually require the presence of surfactants or emulsifiers to maintain the stability of the dispersion and the presence of these in a protective coating makes the coating sensitive to rain and unsuitable for use out of doors. It has now been discovered that a selected group of addition copolymers can be used to provide temporary coating compositions which have a particularly good balance of properties. These properties include, suitability for use outdoors, absence of flash rusting when drying on ferreous surfaces, ease of removal with aqueous alkaline compositions after a period of at least 4 weeks outdoor exposure to the weather, low dirt retention during exterior exposure and ease of handling and stacking coated articles without damage to the coating. The polymers may also yield clear coatings which permit inspection of the coated surface but these coatings may also be tinted for identification purposes. One specific use of alkali soluble polymers is in providing temporary protection for a painted surface from the effect of abrasive particles and the like. Accordingly, this invention provides an aqueous alkali soluble temporary protective coating composition suitable for spraying onto a surface liable to deteriorate through exposure to weather or abrasion, the composition comprising an aqueous liquid medium containing water, an organic water miscible cosolvent and a salt of an addition copolymer, which copolymer The copolymer is present in the aqueous medium in the form of a true solution and at least some of the carboxyl groups in the addition copolymer are neutralised by ammonia and or one or more amines. In most cases, apart from a haze, the addition copolymer will appear to be in solution. According to another aspect of this invention we provide a method of giving temporary protection to a surface liable to deteriorate on direct exposure to the weather or to be damaged by abrasion which comprises spraying onto the surface a coating composition as above defined and allowing the volatile material present to volatilise. According to a further aspect of this invention we provide an article having a surface liable to deteriorate on direct exposure to the weather, or to be damaged by abrasion, the surface having a temporary alkali soluble coating derived from a coating composition as defined above. The organic water miscible cosolvent is a solvent for the addition copolymer, for example an alkanol or an alkyl ether of ethylene glycol or propylene glycol. Suitable water miscible cosolvents include n propanol, isopropanol, n , sec and isobutanol, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, and the monomethyl ether of dipropylene glycol. In selecting a suitable aqueous liquid medium it is necessary to consider such factors as the rate of volatilisation of the liquid medium which is desired after application of the composition to a surface the method of application to the surface, for example whether by spraying or brushing the solubility and or stability of the addition copolymer in the medium the flammability of the medium, and any requirement which is dictated by the nature of the surface, for example the need to dissolve any oil which is on the surface. There may be present a small proportion of a non water miscible solvent. It is often convenient to include as at least part of the aqueous medium of the coating composition the organic solvent in which the addition copolymer has been prepared. In certain cases, however, it may be preferred to remove some or the whole of this solvent and to dissolve or disperse the addition copolymer in a different continuous medium, for example one which is more volatile or one which is of different polarity. The addition copolymer is prepared from polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers by conventional procedures using free radical initiators such as azodiisobutyronitrile, and is preferably prepared in solution in organic solvents, for example isopropanol, sec butanol, ethylene glycol monobutylether or propylene glycol monomethyl ether, which are miscible with both water and with any other desired solvents. When a particular monomer is not soluble in the organic solvent to be used as the polymerisation medium, it may be dissolved in another solvent which is miscible with the organic solvent. For example, meth acrylamide may be dissolved in the minimum proportion of water before addition to the site of polymerisation. The molecular weight of the polymer can be controlled by conventional methods, for example using chain terminating agents such as thioglycollic acid. Preferably the molecular weight is in the range 5,000 to 14,000. Preferably the carboxyl groups present in the addition copolymer are introduced by the use of acrylic and or methacrylic acid as a comonomer although other carboxyl group containing or carboxyl group generating monomers may be used, for example maleic anhydride. It is an advantage of the low molecular weight of the copolymer that treatment with a base does not cause undesired thickening of the composition. The extent of neutralisation of the copolymer may vary depending upon the specific use intended. When it is desired that a touch dry or water resistant coating shall be quickly obtained it is necessary to use a suitably volatile base. The hydrophilic comonomer residue of the copolymer as defined may be obtained by post modification of a preformed addition copolymer, for example of a copolymer containing a precursor of the monomer residue which can be converted to yield the defined residue. However the hydrophilic monomer residues are preferably introduced into the copolymer by conventional polymerisation procedures. The monomer residues of, for example, acrylamide, methacrylamide, vinyl pyrollidone and vinylpyridine may be introduced directly by use of these compounds as comonomers. A poly oxyethylene chain may be introduced by using a comonomer which includes such a chain in the molecules, for example methoxypoly ethyleneglycol meth acrylate, or by post reacting a group on the preformed copolymer which is reactive with, for example, a polyethylene glycol. Preferably the addition copolymer comprises at least 3 by weight of the hydrophilic comonomer residue. Particularly preferred hydrophilic comonomer residues in the addition copolymer are comonomer residues of acrylamide and or methacrylamide, since copolymers according to the invention which contain these residues provide the best balance of properties as temporary coatings on surfaces liable to deterioration, particularly on ferreous surfaces which are liable to rust. Comonomers which are free from carboxyl groups and which do not comprise the defined hydrophilic residues may additionally be used in preparing the addition copolymer. Such comonomers include the alkyl esters of meth acrylic acid, for example methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate or butyl acrylate, and aromatic monomers such as styrene or vinyltoluene. Preferably, in the preparation of the addition copolymer there is used 5 20 by weight of a carboxyl group containing comonomer, 2 20 of a comonomer which comprises the defined hydrophilic monomer residue, or a precursor of the residue, and 60 93 of other comonomer s . Preferably there is present 3 15 by weight of meth acrylamide residues. The glass transition temperature Tg of a coating material is a parameter which frequently presents difficulties in estimation, with different experimental techniques leading to different results. Although it is a function primarily of the composition of the copolymer in respect of the comonomers present and their proportions, other factors such as molecular weight may play a part. For the present purpose, our Tg values are those derived by the use of the expression presented in Polymer Handbook by J Brandup and E M Immergut Interscience, London namely For the Tg values of the individual homopolymers we have relied on the values given in this source and the derived calculated values constitute the definition of Tg according to this specification. The coating compositions of this invention are preferably of solids content in the range 5 to 25 by weight. They may also contain certain additives which will further improve their performance and range of application, for example anti corrosion additives, flow aids and dyes or pigments. The methods of application are conventional for example by spraying, brushing or dipping. The thickness of the coatings obtained is preferably in the range 10 to 20µ, but thinner coatings may be employed, especially on non corrodible substrates. It is an important advantage of the present selected addition copolymers for use in coating compositions that the coating which they provide is readily removed from a surface, particularly a bare metal surface, by treatment with aqueous alkali, for example a 1 to 2 solution of caustic alkali in water. It is a particular advantage that the coating can be removed by an alkaline solution such as is conventionally used to clean bare metal articles before they are subjected to a metal pretreatment process such as phosphating. Such articles will often carry a corrosion resistant oil or wax layer which has to be removed by an alkali treatment. Therefore this invention also provides an improved process of metal pretreatment wherein a metal article to be treated, for example by phosphating, carries a coating of the type herein described and is subjected to an aqueous alkali treatment prior to the reaction of the metal with a pretreatment reagent. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which parts and percentages are by weight. This Example describes the preparation in organic solvent solution of a copolymer, comprising methacrylamide as a comonomer, which is suitable for use according to the invention the preparation therefrom of an aqueous solution and the use of the solution according to the invention. This Example describes the preparation in an organic solvent different from that used in Example 1 of a copolymer comprising acrylamide as a comonomer and suitable for use according to the invention the preparation therefrom of an aqueous solution and the use of the solution according to the invention. After overnight interior storage, the coating panel was exposed to the weather, facing south, for 4 weeks under Southern England winter conditions. There was very little rust spotting on the panel at the end of this period and the coating was easily removed with an alkaline remover composition similar to that of Example 1 c . This Example describes the preparation and use according to the invention of a copolymer similar to that of Example 1 except that there was present only 5 instead of 10 , of methacrylamide as a comonomer. After overnight interior storage the panel was exposed to the weather facing south, for 3 months of winter conditions in Southern England. The coating had very little rust spotting after this time and was easily removed using the alkaline remover described in Example 1 c . This Example describes the preparation and use of a copolymer prepared by a process similar to that used in Example 2 except that the comonomer acrylamide was replaced by 5 of a comonomer incorporating a methoxypoly oxyethylene moiety of molecular weight 350 and the acid content was halved. This Example shows that, in the absence of a hydrophilic comonomer as hereinbefore defined, the addition copolymer does not confer on the coating composition the advantageous properties demonstrated in the preceding Examples. After overnight interior storage, the panel was exposed to Southern England late summer weather conditions for 1 month. After this period of time there was unacceptable scattered rust spotting over the panel. Using the alkaline remover of Example 1, the removal of the coating film from the panel was incomplete after 2 minutes contact time, there being a residue of copolymer coating. This Example describes the preparation and use of a copolymer prepared by a process similar to that used in Example 3, except that the hydrophilic comonomer methacrylamide was replaced with vinyl pyrollidone and the ratio of methyl methacrylate to butyl acrylate was adjusted to give a calculated Tg of 5 C. After overnight interior storage the panel was exposed to the weather, facing south, for 1 month of autumn conditions in southern England. The coating had very little rust spotting after this time and was easily removed using the alkaline remover described in Example 1 c . This Example describes the preparation and use of a copolymer prepared by a process similar to that used in Example 3, except that the hydrophilic comonomer methacrylamide was replaced with 4 vinylpyridine and the ratio of methyl methacrylate to butyl acrylate was adjusted to give a Tg of 5 C. After overnight interior storage the panel was exposed to the weather, facing south, for 3 months of winter conditions in Southern England. The coating had very little rust spotting after this time and was easily removed using the alkaline remover described in Example 1 c after a 1 minute contact time.
