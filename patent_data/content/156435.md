# High pressure discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a high pressure discharge lamp comprising a ceramic discharge vessel 3 enclosing a discharge space in which is present an electrode 5 which comprises an electrode beam 20 , one end 22 of which is passed through the wall 23 of a cup shaped lead through member 24 and is connected thereto in a gas tight manner. According to the invention, the wall 23 of the lead through member 24 is caused to deform away from the discharge space around the electrode beam 20 and laterally engages with clamping fit around the electrode beam over a length of at most the diameter of the electrode beam. Thus, a correct positioning of the electrode beam in the lamp is guaranteed and material used for connecting the electrode beam to lead through member is prevented from entering the dis charge space.
