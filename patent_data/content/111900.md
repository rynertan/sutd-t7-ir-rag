# TAMPER VISIBLE INDICATOR FOR CONTAINER LID

## Abstract
A disc or other insert 14, 64, 110, 170, 220 placed on the neck 48, 104 of a container 50, 102 provides a visible indication that the lid 40, 120, 146, 200, 210 of the container had been removed or tampered with. An indicator 30, 74, 84, 112, 176 is provided on the disc surfaces and it changes its character to provide its indication upon removal of the lid. For example, the indicator might be microencapsulated, and the microcapsules would be broken upon separation of the discs. Means 12, 70, 86, 90, 126, 174, 202, 214 in the lid rub the indicator for activating it. In a variant of this, the lid 120, 146, 200, 210 is transparent and permits viewing of the indicator through the lid. The disc 220 may have a foam layer under the indicator for compensating for manufacturing tolerances.
