# Method and apparatus for measuring roll gap and alignment for continuous casters.

## Abstract
Strand like apparatus for measuring roll position, i.e., roll gap and or roll alignment, is moved through a caster 10 between roll faces of a series of oppositely spaced pairs of conveyor rolls 11, 12 ... which define either a straight or curved strand travel path. Apparatus includes carrier means 34 having resiliently deformable parallel sensing surfaces 36, 37 with an elastomeric core 38 , and plural lateral and plural diagonal inductive distance measuring means 35 pivotally linked to the sensing surfaces for generating roll gap and alignment signals. These signals are recorded. Single and multiple harness means 30 attach single and multiple measuring apparatus 29 to a powered starter bar 31 at one or more lateral strand axes, thereby to make lateral roll position measurements during multiple or single passes, respectively.
