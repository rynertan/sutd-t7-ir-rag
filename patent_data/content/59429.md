## Description
Tape cassette storage box coupling accessory This invention relates to an accessory for coupling a plurality of tape cassette storage boxes for storing cassettes. Basically, a prior art tape cassette storage box is provided with a storage box body for detachably holding a tape cassette, and a cover coupled. to the storage box body so as to be able to rotate between first and second positions. When located in the first position, the cover, in conjunction with the storage box body, stores the tape cassette held in the storage box body. When located in the second position, on the other hand, the cover allows the tape cassette to be removed from the storage box body. Also, there are conventionally known a wide variety of tape cassette storage boxes which are provided with various other components than the basic component consisting of the storage box body and cover. In one such conventional tape cassette storage box, a first coupling means is provided on one of those two lateral surfaces of the storage box body which intersect the rotation axis of the cover, and a second coupling means is provided on the other lateral surface. If you have two such tape cassette storage boxes, you may couple the first coupling means of one to the second coupling means of the other. If two types of tape cassette storage boxes of different dimensions are simultaneously displayed for sale in a shop or in a shopwindow, smaller one will be less attractive to customer s eye than bulkier one will be. Without customer s attention, tape cassette storage boxes, and hence tape cassettes therein, will possibly miss an opportunity to be sold. This invention is contrived in consideration of these circumstances, and is intended to provide a tape cassette storage box coupling accessory for easier carrying and storage, capable of giving tape cassette storage boxes of smaller dimensions, and hence tape cassettes stored therein, equal opportunity to be sold, as compared with ones of greater dimensions among a plurality of types of tape cassette storage boxes of different dimensions simultaneously displayed for sale in a shop or in a shopwindow. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing a first lateral surface of a tape cassette storage box coupling accessory according to an embodiment of this invention Fig. 2 is a side view showing a second lateral surface of the tape cassette storage box coupling accessory of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing a state imediately before two tape cassette storage boxes are coupled to the tape cassette storage box coupling accessory of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a perspective view showing a state in which the two tape cassette storage boxes are coupled to the tape cassette storage box coupling accessory ofFig. 1 and Fig. 5 is a perspective view of a tape cassette storage box for storing a tape cassette greater in dimensions than a tape cassette shown in Fig. 3. Referring now to the drawing of Fig. 1, there is shown a tape cassette storage box coupling accessory hereinafter referred to simply as accessory 10. The accessory 10 includes an accessory body 15 which has a first lateral surface 12 and a second lateral surface 14 parallel to the first lateral surface 12. A first coupling means 16 is provided on the first lateral surface 12, while a second coupling means 18 is mounted on the second lateral surface 14, as shown expressly in detail in Fig. 2. In this embodiment, the accessory body 15 and the first and second coupling means 16 and 18 are integrally formed out of plastics with elasticity. In this embodiment, moreover, the accessory body 15 is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so that the first and second lateral surfaces 12 and 14 have the same shape and dimensions. Fig. 3 shows two tape cassette storage boxes 20 of the same construction. Each of the two tape cassette storage boxes 20 has a storage box body 24 for detachably holding a tape cassette 22. The storage box body 24 has two lateral surfaces 26 and 28 in the same shape and of the same dimensions arranged parallel to each other. A first coupling means 16 is mounted on the one lateral surface 26, while a second coupling means 18 is mounted on the other lateral surface 28. In this embodiment, the tape cassette 22 is a micro cassette, and the shape and dimensions of the two lateral surfaces 26 and 28 are the same as those of the first and second lateral surfaces 12 and 14 of the accessory body 12. The tape cassette storage box 20 further includes a cover 30. The cover 30 is coupled to the storage box body 24 so as to be able to move between a first position where it, in conjunction with the storage box body 24, stores the tape cassette 22 detachably held in the storage box body 24, and a second position where the tape cassette 22 is allowed to be removed from the storage box body 24. In Fig. 3, the cover 30 of the left hand tape cassette storage box 20 is located in its first position, while that of the right hand tape cassette storage box 20 is located in its second position. In coupling the second coupling means 18 of one of the two tape cassette storage boxes and the first coupling means 16 of the other to the first coupling means 16 on the first lateral surface 12 of the accessory body 15 and the second coupling means 18 on the second lateral surface 14, respectively, the other lateral surface 28 of the one tape cassette storage box 20 and the one lateral surface 26 of the other tape cassette storage box 20 are first opposed to the first and second lateral surfaces 12 and 14 of the accessory body 15, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3. Then, the two tape cassette storage boxes 20 are moved severally along the first and second lateral surfaces 12 and 14 of the accessory body 15 in the directions of arrows A and B of Fig. 3, respectively. When the respective front end faces 32 of the left and right hand tape cassette storage boxes 20 are located flush with the front end face 34 of the accessory body 15, as shown in Fig. 4, the coupling between the first coupling means 16 of the accessory 10 and the second coupling means 18 of the left hand tape cassette storage box 20 and between the second coupling means 18 of the accessory 10 and the first coupling means 16 of the right hand tape cassette storage box 20 is completed. Hereupon, as shown in Fig. 4, the respective rear end faces 36 of the left and right hand tape cassette storage boxes 20 are located flush with the rear end face 38 of the accessory body 15. Moreover, the upper and lower surfaces 40 and 42 of the left hand tape cassette storage box 20, as well as of the right hand tape cassette storage box 20, are located flush with the upper and lower surfaces 44 and 46 of the accessory body 15, respectively. The length L between the one lateral surface 26 of the left hand tape cassette storage box 20 the projected end of the first coupling means 16 in this embodiment and the other lateral surface 28 of the right hand tape cassette storage box 20 coupled to the accessory 10 the projected end of the second coupling means 18 in this embodiment is approximately 109 mm.The length L is substantially equal to the longitudinal length Q of a conventional tape cassette storage box 50 for detachably holding a tape cassette 48, as shown in Fig. 5. The tape cassete 48 shown in Fig. 5 is greater in dimensions than the tape cassette 22 shown in Fig. 3. In this embodiment, the tape cassette 48 is what is called a compact tape cassette developed byN.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken of the Netherlands. Further, the distance W from the front end face 32 to the rear end face 36 of the tape cassette storage box 20 shown in Fig. 4, i.e., the distance from the front end face 34 to the rear end face 38 of the accessory body 15, is smaller than the length w of the tape cassette storage box 50 of Fig. 5 along the direction substantially at right angles to the longitudinal direction. In Fig. 5, a cover 52 of the tape cassette storage box 50 is located in its second position where the tape cassette 48 detachably held in a main body of the storage box 50 is allowed to be removed from the main body 54. If the cover 52 is located in its first position as represented by two dot chain line in Fig. 5, however, it will, in conjunction with the main body 54, store the tape cassette 48 detachably held in the main body 54. Furthermore, the distance H between the upper and lower surfaces 40 and 42 of the tape cassette storage box 20 shown in Fig. 4, i.e., the distance between the upper and lower surfaces 44 and 46 of the accessory body 15, is smaller than the height h of the tape cassette storage box 50 shown in Fig. 5.
