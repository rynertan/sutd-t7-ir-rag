# Collagen implant material and method of preparing it.

## Abstract
An injectable collagen material composed of reconstitut ed, mechanically sheared atelopeptide collagen fibers. The material is prepared by passing reconstituted collagen fibers repeatedly through a rigid mesh screen, until a substantial raduction in fiber size and size heterogeneity is achieved. The mechanically sheared fibers may be further crosslinked to im prove implant characteristics.
