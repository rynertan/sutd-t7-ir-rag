# Apparatus for gasification of solid carbonaceous material.

## Abstract
A gasification apparatus utilizing a molten metal bath is disclosed. The apparatus comprises a gasification chamber 3 of the closed type, which is provided with a product gas recovery port and at least one top blowing lance, and which maintains said molten metal bath a slag discharge chamber 4 of the closed type, which is communicated with said gasification chamber a means for allowing a molten slag on the molten metal bath in said gasification chamber to flow into said slag discharge chamber a pressure controlling means 13 for controlling the pressure of said slag discharge chamber so as to control the level of the molten slag in said slag discharge chamber a means for discharging the molten slag from said slag discharge chamber when the level of the molten slag in said slag discharge chamber reaches a predetermined height and a slag collecting chamber 10 of the closed type which collects the slag discharged out of said slag discharge chamber, said slag collecting chamber being in fluid com munication with said slag discharge chamber so that said molten slag in said slag discharge chamber may flow into said slag collecting chamber.
