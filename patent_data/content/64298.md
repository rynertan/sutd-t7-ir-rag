# Pulse generating circuit for a television camera using solid state image sensor.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a solid state television camera with solid state image sensor for converting an optical image into electrical signals, which is comprised of a pulse generator 30, 33, 34, 39 for generating a train of pulses with a frequency equal to the horizontal scanning frequency of a television system, a frequency divider 61 for frequency dividing the pulse train into a signal with a frequency substantially equal to the vertical scanning frequency alter nately in two modes of 1 n and 1 n 1 wherein n is a positive integer , and a selective circuitry 63, 64, 65, 66 and 67 to 69 for forming a train of pulses with a desired vertical scanning frequency on the basis of the pulse trains derived from the pulse generator 34 and the frequency divider 61 .
