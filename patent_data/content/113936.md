# Supported catalyst for polymerization of olefins.

## Abstract
This invention comprises a catalytic component for po lymerizing olefins comprising a solid support containing mag nesium halogen bonds, a transition metal halide of a metal se lected from Groups IVB and VB of the periodic table, and an electron donor obtained by the steps comprising a reacting an organometallic compound whose metal comprise members of Groups I to III of the periodic table with an alcohol, ROH, where R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl, or arylalkyl moiety having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, a polysiloxane, and a transition metal halide to form a solid b treating the solid with a transition metal halide option ally int he presence of a poiysiloxane to form a treated solid and c reacting the treated solid with an electron donor and a transition metal halide to form the component.
