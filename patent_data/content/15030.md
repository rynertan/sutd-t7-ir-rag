## Description
SKIN CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS The present invention is related to skin conditioning compositions which possess a unique combination of moisturizing materials. The moisturizing combination provides excellent skin conditioning benefits while also being very easy to rub in i.e. very spreadable and quick to rub in and not leaving an undesirable greasy residue on the skin. The treatment of human skin with various agents has been undertaken for many years with the goal being to keep the skin in a smooth and supple condition. Skin has the tendency to dry out when extended periods of exposure to the elements and cleaning solutions are encounterea. From a biochemical standpoint, dryness is a measure of the water content of the skin. Under normal conditions, the water content and vapor pressure of the epidermis are higher than those of the surrounding air with consequent evaporation of water from the skin surface.Skin becomes dry because of excessive loss of water from the surface and the subsequent loss of water from the stratum corneum. The facial areas present special problems in addition to those present with, for instance, the hands. Some facial areas, due to high concentrations of sebaceous and sweat glands, often feel greasy to a person. Other facial areas do not feel this way and may feel overly dry. The facial areas are also subject to wrinkling which causes difficulty in achieving good distribution of facial compos,tions. All of these problems require that special care be taken in formulating a product which is to be used on the face as well as other body areas. Background Art To alleviate the aforementioned conditions, emollient creams as described in Sagarin, CosmeticsScience and Technology, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1, Wiley Interscience 1972 have been recommended for application to the skin. The emollient materials probably increase the state of hydration of the corneous layer of the skin by altering the rate of diffusion of water from the lower epidermal and dermal layers, the rate of evaporation of water from the skin s surface, and the ability of the corneous layer to hold moisture. The use or three of tine essential moisturizing components of the present compositions, lanolin fatty acids, sterols and a hydroxy alcohol or a sugar, has been disclosed in the art but not in the critical amounts found to be essential in the present invention. U.S. Patent 3,957,971, May 18, 1976 to Oleniazz discloses liposomes comprising lecithin, dicetyl phosphate, a sterol and an aqueous solution of a humectant. U.S. Patent 3,818,105,June 18, 1974 to Coppersmith et al discloses compositions containing isoparaffinic hydrocarbons and other cosmetic additives such as lanolin and a humectant such as propylene glycol. U.S. Patent Re. 29,814, October 24, 1978 to W. E. Snyder discloses compositions containing lanolin fatty acids, silicone, lanolin derivatives and sorbitol. Cholesterol in a variety of compositions is disclosed in Drug and Cosmetic Industry, Vol. 74, pp. 52, 53, 127 137 1954 . Disclosure of the Invention The present invention relates to superior skin conditioning compositions comprising an emulsion which contains from about 8 to about 258, preferably from about 12 to about 15t, of skin moisturizing materials of which about 2.5 to about 8 is a sterol, about 10 to 35 is a sugar, a penitol or a hexitol, and about 5 to about 15 is lanolin fatty acids. An emulsifier is also present as a skin moisturizing ingredient. It has been discovered that the above described components provide skin conditioning lotions which are easily robbed into the skin and do not leave a greasy, undesirable residue. Detailed Description of the Invention As discussed above, the present compositions comprise a moisturizing fraction having certain critical components. In addition, the compositions may contain additional oil soluble, skin conditioning materials to work in cooperation with the critical moisturizing com ponents. Furthermore, the present emulsion compositions may also contain additional water soluble materials to improve the overall acceptability of the compositions.Each of the various components is discussed in detail below. Sterol The sterol component used in the present compositions may be selected from any of the available animal or plant sterols. Preferably, the sterol is selected from the group consisting of cholesterol, phytosterol, sitosterol, sitosterol pyrogllltomate, 7 dehydrocholesterol, lanosterol and mixtures thereof. The preferred sterol is cholesterol. The sterol is present at a level of from about 2.5 to about 8E, preferably from about 4 to 8t, by weight of the skin moisturizing fraction. Sugar or Hydroxy Alcohol The sugar or hydroxy alcohol useful in the present compositions is selected from the group consisting of C5 or C6 monosaccharides, C5 or C6 disaccharides, pentahy o droxy alcohols, hexahydroxy alcohols and mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable monosaccharides include arabinoses, xyloses, ribose, glucose, galactose, mannose and fructose. Suitable disaccharides include lactose, maltose, gentiobiose, cellobiose and sucrose. Suitable hydroxy alcohols include arabitol, xylitol, adonitol mannitol, sorbitol and dulcitol.

Sorbitol is the preferred sugar or hydroxy alcohol.Lanolin Fatty acids Lanolin fatty acids also, referred to as wool wax acids, include a variety of different acids. K. Motiuk, Ã¬n the Journal Of The American Oil Chemists Society,Vol. 56, No. 2, Pages 91 97 1979 , incorporated herein by reference, reviewed the analyses which have been performed on lanolin fatty acids and developed an average composition. The acids, their chain lengths and percent in the average composition are shown below. of lanolin Acids Chain length fatty acidsNormal acids C8 C38 10Iso acids C8 C8 22Anteiso acids 7 C40 28 C, C,Normal alpha hydroxy acids C 8 2 17Iso alpha hydroxy acids 4 9Anteiso hydroxy acids C C44 3Normal hydroxy acids 2 ,C36 3Iso hydroxy acids 2 0 5Anteiso hydroxy acidsC136 1 3 35Polyhydroxy acids 4.5 Unsaturated acids 2 Total 100 It should be recognized that the composition is an average composition and that the acids as well as the amount of any particular type of acid in a particular batch may vary somewhat from the average. It should also be recognized that commercial lanolin fatty acids may contain esters of the acids which are formed in the separation process, infra. The percentages for the lanolin fatty acid component of the present compositions include such esters. Lanolin fatty acids can be separated from lanolin by saponification as described in Amerchol LanolinDerivatives, Vol. II 1971 , Amerchol, a unit of CpC International, Inc., incorporated herein by reference.Amerchol markets lanolin fatty acids under the namesAmerlate LFA and Amerlate WFA. The lanolin fatty acids are present at a level of from about 5 to about 15 , preferably from about 8 to 12 , by weight of the moisturizing fraction.Additional Oil Soluble Moisturlzing Components The skin conditioning emulsion compositions of the present invention may also contain emollient materials which help serve to moisturize the skin.
