## Description
DESCRIPTION WASHING COMPOSITION The present invention relates to a washing composition comprising 2 surface active agent and a builder as basic components, and at least one compound selected from specific compounds added to the basic components, which washing composition serves to improve washing performance particularly when acting at lower temperatures and excluding phosphate from the builder for energysaving and anti pollution, and is mainly used for industrial purposes. Conventional washing agents generally comprises surface actve agents from at least one of anionic, nonionic, cationic or amphoteric agents and a builder including chelating agents including inorganic or organic salts with and. alkaline property, and enzymes, bleaching agents, fluorescent agents, anti corrosive agents, solubilization agents, solvents or the like are added thereto if desired. Such washing agents are selected according to their intended use at a washing concentration of I to 100 g l and 2 washing temperature of 10 to 80 C. In order to wash off strong contamination caused by adhesion of animal oil, mineral oil, wax or grease, however, high temperature washing 70 to 80 C or extension of washing time may be required. In high temperature washing as above described, some conditions of the substance to be cleaned may injure the surface of the substance. A kind of cont r n ation may produce strong adhesion of dirt onto the surface of the substance. Accordingly, since the application of the high temperature washing is restricted and moreover the cost of heating fuel has significantly increased in recent years, the advent of a cleaning agent which has a strong cleaning perfornance in low temperature regions 10 to 50 C has been eagerly awaited. Customary builders, including sodium tripolyphos phate are used on account of their excellent performance. However, if sodium tripolyphosphate contained in waste water is discharged into river, lake of sea region, extraordinary breeding of plankton results in contamin ation by over nourishment in the river, lake or sea region. Accordingly, the development of 2 washing agent having a strong washing performance using a builder which does not include sodium tripolyphosphate has been desired, but not yet realized. A washing agent according to the present invention comprises basic components including a surface active agent and a builder together with at least one compound selected from dithionites, compounds having a sulfino group or salts thereof, hydrazine compounds, dihydroxy phenols, diketones and derivatives of sugars. Based on the above mentioned feature, a washing composition according to the present invention can provide a strong washing effect in a low temperature region 10 to 50 even if the builder does not contain sodium tripolyphosphate, and thereby it contributes to energysaving and anti pollution. A preferred washing composition according to the present invention is usually composed of the following components wherein wt is inter percentage a surface active agent oceoc 0.5 to 40 wtH b builder ..... 45 to 98.5 wtS c specific additive compound ..... 0.5 to 30 t ,f in the case o hydrosulfite Sodium dithionite 1 to 20 wt . a The above mentioned surface active agent is selected from one or more surface active agents generally used such as anionic, non ionic, cationic and amphoteric agents as hereinafter described. Not only the surfaceactive agents shown as examples but also other various agents acting similarly may be used. 1 anionic agent alkyl benzene sulionate with straight chain or branched chain, alkylsulfate ester salt, alkanesulfonate, alpha olefin sulfonate, alkylethoxysulfate ester salt. 2 non ionic agent polyoxyethylated higher fatty alcohol with straight chain or branched chain, polyoxyethylated alkylphenol, block formed polymer of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide. 3 cationic agent quaternary trimethyl alkyl ammonium salts, quaternary dimethyl alkyl benzyl ammonium salts, quaternary alkyl iniaazolinium salts. 4 amphoteric agent alkyl betaine, salts of alkyl amino carboxylic acids, alkyl diaminoalkyl glycine, alkyl imidazolinium betaine. The surface active agent is incorporated in the composition in the above mentioned amount. If the amount is less than 0.5 wt , the mashing effect cannot be substantially obtained if it is more than 40 wt , an excessive amount of surface active agent in aqueous solution may cause salting out, with resultant decrease in the cleaning effect. Preferably the amount of surface active agent incorporated is 1 to 35 wt . b The builder is worried as a combination of agents selected from common inorganic salts, caustic alkalis and salts of organic cida as exemplified herein after and adjusted so that the aqueous solution of the builder as a whole becomes alkaline. 1 inorganic salts ... silicates such as sodium orthosilicate, sodium sesquisilicate, sodium metasilicate or other sodium silicates, borates such as sodium borate or borax, carbonates such as sodium carbonate, sodium sesquicarbonate or sodium bicarbonate, mirabilite, sodium chloride. 2 caustic alkalis ... sodium hydroxide. 3 salts of organic acids ... carboxylates such as sodium citrate sodium hydroxyacetate, sodium malate, sodium tartrate, sodium gluconate or sodium polyacrylate, aminocarboxylates such as nitrilotriacetate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, glycine salts or glutamates. The builder is incorporated in the above mentioned amount. If the amount is less than 45 wt , the washing agent cannot be prevented from coagulating if it is more than 98.5 wtS, the relative amount of the surfaceactive agent becomes too small for performance of the washing agent. The preferred amount of builder incorporated is 50 to 95 wt . c The specific additive compound is selected from 1 dithionites, 2 compounds having a sulfino group or salts thereof, 3 hydrazine compounds, 4 dihydroxy phenols, 5 diketones 6 compounds derived from sugars. Any specific additive compound serves to improve significantly the effect of the washing agent consisting of surface active agent and builder, dissolved in water and to extend the peak of the washing effect towards a lower tenDerature region as hereinafter described by way of examples. Although the reason for the function of the specific additive compound is not clear, the washing function of the washing composition according to the present invention seems to be as follows Soil adhered to the substance to be washed includes oily soil, solid soil or the like. The soil is adhered on the surface of the substance to be washed by means of physical adsorption or chemical adsorption.Oily soil such as rust preventive oil, rolling oil or cutting oil comprises a distilled component for lubricating oil hydrocarbons as a base component together with a rust preventing additive or an extreme pressure additive having very strong chemical adsorption, that is, polar groups such as a carboxyl group, sulfo group, hydroxyl group, phosphono group, nitrogen atom, sulfur atom or chlorine atom,The above mentioned polar materials seem to form a strong adsorption layer on the metal surface by means of chemical adsorption, or to form a lubricating metallic compound by reacting with the metal surface under high temperature and high pressure. Generally to obtain a clean surface it is required in a washing action that surface adsorption material is removed from the surface of the substance to be cleaned and replaced by harmless material for subsequent processing. The harmless material means molecules or ions of builder, surfane active agent, and water in the washing liquid. In the washing process, a specific additive compound according to the present invention co operates with tbe builder and surface active agent. At first, it strongly supports the function of emulsification, solubilization dispersion or tlie like as washing factors, whereby oily contataination is liable to be washed away and the oil layer adhered on the metal surface gradually becomes thin. When washing reaches near the metal surface in this process, the metal surface has a layer of soil adhered by meano of chemical or physical adsorption as hereinbefore described. It often occurred with conventional washing agents that the adsorption layer could not be removed well.However, in a washing composition including a specific additive compound according to the present invention, under a state of decreased surface tension the specific additive compound accompanied by the builder and surface additivagent can easily approach the oil adsorbed portion and replace the adsorbed soil. This is probably based on Åa nucleophilic property of the specific additive agent. The specific additive compound, builder and surfaceactive agent, which newly cover the surface of the substance to be cleaned in the abovementioned manner, make the substance surface hydrophilic and prevent the soil particles from adhering again. Thus the washing is completed. The amount of the specific additive incorporated depends on the washing object the sort of soil and the washing temperature, and generally has a value ranging from 0.5 to 30 wtr 1 to 20 wt ,o for hydrosulfite sodium dithicn i.te . If the amount is less than the lower limit value, improvement of the required washing effect is not obtained in comparison to non addition if it is more than the upper linit value, improvement is scarcely obtained and, on the contrary, reduction of the washing effect may occur on accowlt of problem in solubility or the like. Examples of specific additive compounds are as follows 1 dithionites 1. hydrosulfite 2 compounds having a sulfino group of salts thereof 2o Rongalite sodium formaldeyde sulfoxylate 3. thiourea dioxide 3 a compound having a thiol radical 4. the monoethanolamine salt of thioglycolic acid 4 hydrazine compounds 5. hydrazine hydrate 5 dihydroxy phenols 6. hydroquinone 7. catechol 8. protocatechuic acid 6 diketones 9. diacetyl 7 compounds derived from sugars 100 L ascorbic acid 11. Erythorbic acid or salt thereof Specific additive compounds as above exemplified may be combined with each other or with the following compounds instead of with other specific compounds. In some combinations,the washing effect may be improved in a multiplicative function. A multiplicative effect is significant particularly in the combination of hydrosulfite and sugars. a sugars glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose b gallic acid c P hydroxybenzaldehyde d trimellitic anhydride e dextrin f triethylenetetriamine The total amount incorporated of additive compounds consisting of two or more components is 1 to 40 wt .The reason for the numerical limitation is similar to that for the abovementioned one component specific additive compounds The effect of the present invention will now be confirmed by comparing embodiments of the invention with comparing examples In this connection reference will be made to the accompanying drawing in which Fig. 1 is a graph illustrating variation of washing performance in embodiment 5 and comparing examples 3 to 5 in dependence on temperature variation. Testing Method A specimen is prepared by cleaning cold rolled steel sheet 100mm x 50mm x 0.6mm t with trichloroethylene solvent, applying various sorts of oil to be washed away from the steel sheet surface, and heating the oil at 600C for 36 hours at room temperature for 10 days in embodiments 6 to 9 and comparing examples 6 to 7 . Each specimen in the embodiments and comparing examples is immersed in an aqueous solution containing a washing agent of concentration 40g litre at a prescribed temperature for a prescribed time. After rinsing with water, it is further immersed in an aqueous solution of dilute sulfuric acid of 0.5 wt and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes whereby the washed portion is rusted. In order to estimate the washing effect, the ratio of area of the rusted portion versus the total area of the specimen is visually inspected and designated as the washing ratio in . Each value of the washing ratio 5 in the tables is a mean value of the test results of the washing ability measurement performed 5 times.
