# Apparatus for moving filter press plates.

## Abstract
A filter press 100 comprises a main frame having upper side bars 102 for movably supporting a plurality of filter plates 110A 110E in horizontally stacked relation. The plates are moved to open the filter press by plate transporting trolleys 120 which are supported on the upper side bars 102 . Light emitters 150 are mounted at one end of the press on each side bar 102 and light detectors 152 are mounted at the opposite end of the press on each side bar 102 and are aligned to re ceive light from the light emitters. Shutters 214 are coupled to the plate transporting trolleys 120 such that the light from the light emitters 150 is normally blocked by the shutters 214 . The shutters 214 are opened for a brief period of time when the plate transporting trolleys 120 are moved into en gagement with one of the filter plates 110A 110E such that plate engagement signals are generated by the light detectors 152 . Control circuitry 154 manages the motion of the plate transporting trolleys 120 in response to the plate engage ment signals from the light detectors 152 such that the plates 110A 110E are automatically opened and the trolleys 120 are returned to a park position 131 . The trolleys 120 are also initialized for the next opening operation during travel to the park position 131 .
