# Process for producing metallic carbonitride.

## Abstract
The carbonitrides of metals such as those of Groups IV, V and VI of the Periodic Table are prepared by calcining a precursor obtained by i reacting the reaction product of ammonia and the halide of a metal with carbohydrate and or polyvinyl alcohol, or ii reacting the reaction product of carbohydrate and or polyvinyl alcohol and the halide of a metal with ammonia. The desired metallic carbonitride in the form of finely divided powder having a uniform size and an excellent sintering property can be obtained at low energy consumption.
