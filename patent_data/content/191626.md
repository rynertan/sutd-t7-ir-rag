# Improvements in self energising disc brakes.

## Abstract
In a self energising disc brake of the spreading type the anular position of a pressure plate 5, 6 in a retracted brakes off position is determined by an adjuster member comprising a cam 38, 56 which cooperates with the plate and of which the relative position is adjustable. The cam is carried by a cam shaft 23 which is radially or axially arranged, and is accessible from the exterior of the housing 4 . The cam may be incorpo rated into and comprise the stop abutment for arresting angular movement of one of the plates when the brake is applied.
