# High melt viscoelastic polypropylene for post processed sheets and for blow moulding.

## Abstract
A polypropylene PP having a superior postprocess ability and blow moldability is provided, which PP is ob tained by polymerizing propylene at multiple stages using a catalyst comprising a TiClâ‚ƒ composition, an organoalumi nium compound and a molecular weight M.W. modifier, the resulting final polymer comprising a higher M.W. por tion and a lower M.W. portion having a melt flow index of 0.03 to 2.0 g 10 min., and between this index and a melt flow index 10.2 kg 10 minutes, 230 C as measured under 5 times the load applied in the measurement of the former melt flow index, there being a relationship log HMI 0.922 log MI 1.44, and the final polymer consisting of 40 to 60 weight of a PP portion corresponding to the higher M.W. portion and 60 to 40 weight of a PP portion corresponding to the lower M.W. portion.
