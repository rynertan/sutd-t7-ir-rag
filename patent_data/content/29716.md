# Semiconductor prom device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor PROM device comprising a plurality of word address decoders, each of the word address decoders having a decoder section and a high potential voltage supplying section including a transistor which is connected between one of the word lines and a high potential voltage source and which is turned on when programming is effected. The semiconductor PROM device further comprises a plurality of gated program signal generators each of which is supplied with a part of input address signals for selecting a block of the word address decoders. Each of gated program signals from the gated program signal generators is applied to the gate electrode of the transistor of the word address decoder whose input address signals include part of the input address signals supplied to the gated program signal generator.
