# Production of acetic acid, propionic acid and their esters.

## Abstract
When carbon monoxide and hydrogen syngas are reacted at elevated temperature and pressure above 150 C, above 35 bars in the presence of a ruthenium containing catalyst and a cobalt, titanium or zirconium co catalyst dispersed in a low melting quaternary ammonium or phosphonium compound, the reaction is directed to the selective production of carboxylic acids acetic, propionic and their esters by employing a halogen containing cobalt, titanium or zirconium compound as co catalyst or by em ploying a halogen free cobalt, titanium or zirconium com pound in the presence of iodine or an iodine compound.
