# Monitoring electroless plating.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for determining the initiation, progress, and quality of electroless plating of blind or through hole walls in circuit panels. A test coupon 10 for monitoring the plating is provided having a sensitized initiation conductivity zone 23 and sensitized through hole 13 walls arranged in a series resistance circuit 12, 14, 15, 16 . Both conductivity zone and series circuit are measured periodically as to resistivity to determine the start of electroless plating and its progress during continued immer sion of the panels in the plating bath.
