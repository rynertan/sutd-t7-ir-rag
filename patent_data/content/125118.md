## Description
The present invention relates to an immunoassay using an enzyme label, in which the detection of the unknown substance is performed colorimetrically directly upon a solid surface. More specifically, the system is related to the detection of antigen or antibody in a biologically derived fluid sample, such as serum or urine. There are a number of known techniques for the determination of an unknown quantity of antigen or antibody in a biological fluid, such as serum or urine. Two widely used ones are competitive binding and sandwich immunoassays utilizing labeled or tagged immunochemical reagents. For example, in a typical sandwich technique for the detection of unknown antigen in a sample, antibody for the unknown antigen is bound to a solid surface and reacted with the antigen. After washing of the solid surface, a labeled antibody is reacted with the surface and the amount of bound labeled antibody is measured as an indication of the antigen quantity in the serum sample. In the competitive technique, antibody bound to a solid surface may be contacted with the sample containing an unknown quantity of the antigen to be determined, and with labeled antigen of the same type. After washing, the amount of labeled antigen bound on the surface is measured, providing an indirect indication of the amount of unknown antigen in the sample. Known labels are of the radioactive or fluorometric type, which are detected by instrumentation, and colorimetric labels, typically an enzyme label which causes the conversion of a corresponding substrate to colored form. In one competitive technique, antigen is determined with enzyme labeled antigen and an antibody coated tube. Engvall, et al, In another immunoassay, the labeled substance is deposited onto a surface which is read directly. In Harte U.S. Patent 4,133,639, the main system disclosed is that of depositing a fluorochrome labeled substance onto an impermeable continuous surface, and reading the surface with a fluorometer. The system is also stated to be applicable to detection of radioactive labels in a radioimmunoassay, and to spectrophotometric detection. In addition, the patent suggests at column 7, lines 25 38, that the system is also applicable to the use of enzyme labeled systems such as disclosed in Pesce et al, US A 4168146 discloses a bibulous test strip for carrying out immunoassays, the strip having antibodies bound to it. The strip in use is contacted with the aqueous solution containing a suspected antigen. It is then contacted in turn with an aqueous solution containing labeled antibodies. EP A 0063810 discloses devices and kits for immunoassays which comprise solid porous supports, preferably in the form of a sheet, with antigens or immunoglobulins, or both, bound directly to them. US A 4299916 discloses an assay method which utilises a solid surface to which one of the members of an immunological pair mip is bonded, and a signal producing system, which includes a catalytic member bonded to a mip, the signal system resulting in a measurable signal on said solid surface which is related to the amount of analyte in the medium. WO A 8002800 discloses a method for detecting ovulation in human females comprising the use of a bibulous mat which contains an antibody against estrogen induced peroxidase. Clinical Chemistry vol. 28, no. 9 1982 , page 1862 to 1866 discloses enzyme immunoassay techniques for a range of glycoprotein tropic hormones utilising antibodies to the α and β subunits of the hormone to be assayed. The anti α subunit antibody is coupled to horseradish peroxidase. According to the present invention, a colorimetric immunoassay of antigen or antibody is provided by direct visual observation of a color upon a solid surface. Referring to a sandwich immunoassay for detecting antigen in a fluid sample, sample containing unknown antigen is contacted with a solid phase comprising immobilized antibody bound in a layer to a solid surface, and with a soluble enzyme labeled antibody. The antigen immunologically bonds to the immobilized antibody and to the labeled antibody. The solid phase is washed free of unreacted soluble enzyme labeled antibody. Then, the solid phase is contacted with a solution containing soluble substrate for the enzyme to cause the substrate to be converted into an insoluble colored form which deposits on the solid phase. Thereafter, the solid phase is separated from the substrate solution and is visually read as a semiquantitative indication of the presence of the antigen to be detected. The system is also applicable to the detection of unknown antibody in an analogous sandwich technique. A preferred solid surface is non swellable impermeable plastics continuous surface of a dipstick, although other forms of the solid surfaces such as a bead may be employed. This system is also applicable to a competitive colorimetric immunoassay. The system is applicable to the detection of pregnancy, wherein the antigen to be detected is human chorionic gonadotropin, and to the detection of ovulation wherein the antigen is luteinizing hormone. The following advantages are achieved by use of the present system. Increased sensitivity is provided because of the enzyme substrate amplification of the signal in contrast to direct labeling of the antibody or antigen. Background noise due to incomplete washing of the enzyme label is minimized by direct reading of the solid surface, rather than reading the substrate solution, which may include unbound enzyme labeled substance which has not been removed by washing. Also, termination of the enzymatic reaction on the dipstick is readily accomplished by removal from the substrate solution and rinsing in water and, optionally, blotting, in contrast to the requirement of a chemical stop solution where the soluble substrate is read in solution. In addition, the colored dipstick can be used as a permanent record of test results. Semi quantitation of the test results is achieved by visual inspection of the intensity of the color on the stick, in comparison with a color chart or reference stick. Furthermore, the system does not require an instrument and so can be used for the home test market. Regarding such market, the colorimetric end point is more easily read than other systems which do not require instrumentation, such as agglutination reaction tests. Thus, in general the invention provides a method for the colorimetric immunoassay of an immunologically reactive substance to be detected in a fluid sample, comprising For simplicity of description, the system will first be described with respect to a sandwich type colorimetric immunoassay of antigen. An effective sandwich methodology using enzyme labels is set out in Wada, H. G., et al, In the sandwich technique, the antibody is immobilized as a bound layer on a solid surface, such as the reaction portion of a dipstick. This solid phase is then contacted with the fluid sample containing antigen, and with enzyme labeled antibody immunologically reactive with the antigen. The antigen binds to the immobilized antibody on the solid phase, and with the labeled antibody, also on the solid phase, to form a reaction product in order comprising solid surface The solid surface to be layered with the antigen or antibody comprises a non swellable, impermeable plastics continuous surface. The term impermeable is intended to exclude a surface capable of substantial retentive absorption of reagents during washing, such as filter paper. In other words, the solid surface should be sufficiently impermeable to liquid to permit effective removal by washing of unbound reagent. A preferred color for the dipstick is white or other color that enhances the color of the dye. If desired, solid phases other than dipsticks, such as the solid surface of a bead, may also be employed. The chemical nature of the surface to be layered is such as to permit binding of the antigen or antibody. For covalent binding, suitable surfaces include a plastic such as polymethylmethacrylate, polystyrene, polyethylene poly terephthalate, polyester, polypropylene, and the like. In a typical instance, the diagnostic reagent antigen or antibody nay be bound to a plastic sheet which is thereafter cut to an appropriate dipstick shape that will fit into a reaction vessel such as a test tube. The term dipstick means an article with a handle portion and a reaction surface portion. For covalent bonding, indirect coupling may be used in which coupling reagents reactive with functional groups of the diagnostic reagents serve as bridges between the polymer surface and a diagnostic reagent. Such functional groups include amino groups, hydroxyl groups, mercapto groups, amido groups, and carboxyl groups. Suitable coupling techniques between the polymer and diagnostic reagent are set forth in Bennich et al U.S. patent 3,720,760. In some instances, the diagnostic reagent to be immobilized may be coated by adsorption onto the solid surface rather than being covalently bonded. In a specific technique, covalent bonding of antibody to the dipstick may be accomplished by pre coating the plastic surface with a film of agarose or other hydrophilic polymer such as polysaccharide, polyethylene glycol, polypeptide, and the like. The antibody or antigen is then covalently attached to this hydrophilic coating. The hydrophilic coating avoids non specific binding of the analyte or enzyme conjugate to the plastic surface by hydrophobic interaction. Thus, use of this type of dipstick minimizes background binding. In the next step, the immobilized antibody containing solid phase is contacted with the biologically derived fluid sample, typically serum or urine, containing the unknown antigen to be detected, and with soluble enzyme labeled antibody. The immobilized antibody and enzyme labeled antibody are both immunologically reacted with the antigen so that the reaction product is formed comprising solid surface antibody antigen enzyme labeled antibody. Any of the conventional known orders of addition for the sandwich technique may be employed. For example, the antigen, immobilized antibody, and labeled antibody may be added simultaneously. For this technique, it is preferable to use a monoclonal antibody as the labeled antibody to minimize problems of cross blocking by immobilized and labeled antibodies. In another technique, the forward sandwich assay, the antigen is reacted with the immobilized antibody prior to reacting with the labeled antibody. In this instance, after incubation of the antigen and immobilized antibody, the surface may be washed to remove unbound material prior to the addition of the labeled antibody. In addition, the reverse sandwich assay may be used where the antigen and labeled antibody may be mixed, with or without an incubation step, prior to contact with the immobilized antibody. Researchers have suggested that this order of addition provides the advantages of increased sensitivity and decreased incubation times, as set forth in Piasso et al U.S. Patent No. 4,098,876. After reaction to form the solid phase containing immobilized antibody antigen enzyme labeled antibody, the solid phase is separated from the solution containing the unreacted soluble enzyme labeled antibody. This is preferably followed by a washing step to remove unbound labeled antibody from the surface of the solid phase. Thereafter, the separated solid phase is contacted with a solution containing soluble substrate for the enzyme. An important feature of the invention is that the substrate is of a type which converts from soluble to insoluble form in the presence of the enzyme. Since the enzyme is on the surface of the solid phase, the insoluble substrate activated by the enzyme on the solid phase precipitates directly upon the solid phase. For this purpose, it is preferable to use as the solid phase a reaction surface of a dipstick which can be dipped into a test tube of substrate solution and mixed with the substrate. The precipitated substrate is in a visually discernible colored form. In one embodiment, the substrate is initially uncolored and, in the presence of the enzyme, is converted to a colored form. In another embodiment, the soluble substrate is a first color or shade, and converts to a second color or shade upon precipitation. After sufficient reaction time for the enzyme to cause the conversion of substrate to insoluble colored form, the solid phase is separated from the substrate solution. The presence of the visually discernible color on the solid phase is an indication that the biologically derived fluid contained the antigen to be detected. The intensity of the color on the solid phase is a semiquantitative determination of the concentration of antigen in the biological fluid. That is, the intensity of the color is proportional to the concentration of the antigen. By comparing the color on the solid phase with a color chart or reference solid phase such as dipstick surfaces, semiquantitative results may be obtained for the test results. Use of an instrument such as a reflectance densitometer with opaque dipsticks, or a spectrophotometer with an optically clear dipstick, can be used to enhance the quantitative aspect of this test system. The antigen or antibody conjugate with the enzyme is preferably formed by conventional techniques of linkage by one or more covalent bonds. Such covalent linking may be accomplished by addition of external coupling or bridging molecules, or by direct condensation of existing side chains. Bifunctional bridging agents for accomplishing this purpose are well known in the art. One advantage of the system is that the wash steps are particularly rapid in that the solid surface dipstick can be quickly rinsed after enzyme incubation and prior to contact with the substrate. Unbound enzyme is not as critical in this system in that enzyme antibody which has not been fully washed off will diffuse into the substrate solution and not cause precipitation directly upon the solid surface. Thus, background noise from incomplete washing is minimized. Another advantage of the system compared to reading the substrate solution is that it is easy to stop the enzyme substrate reaction at the desired end point. That is, at an appropriate time the dipstick is removed from the enzyme solution, which stops the substrate reaction. This is to be contrasted with reading the solution wherein a chemical stop solution must be provided. A further advantage to the system is that the colored dipstick may be used as a permanent record of test results so long as the substrate dye is of sufficient stability. The above sandwich technique has been described with respect to the determination of an unknown antigen in a biologically derived solution using immobilized antibody and soluble enzyme labeled antibody. The system is particularly effective for the detection of pregnancy where the antigen to be detected is human chorionic gonadotropin. In addition, the system can be used for the detection of ovulation where the antigen to be detected is luteinizing hormone. The system is also applicable to the determination of any antigen against which appropriate antibodies may be raised. It should be understood that the sandwich technique is also applicable to the determination of antibody in such a system. In that instance, the antibody immobilized on the solid surface is substituted with immobilized antigen, and the enzyme labeled antibody is substituted with an enzyme labeled anti immunoglobulin. In other respects, the aforementioned description is applicable. One preferred final reacted product formed by the sandwich technique is a reacted dipstick for an immunoassay. In such dipstick, a solid reaction surface portion includes bound consecutive layers as follows. The first layer is antibody immunologically bound to antigen. Such antigen is, in turn, immunologically bound to enzyme labeled antibody. A visually discernible colored substrate is precipitated onto the surface of such consecutive layers. The substrate is of a type which has been converted from a soluble to a precipitated colored form due to the presence of the enzyme. As set forth above, suitable antigens include human chorionic gonadotropin hCG and luteinizing hormone hLH . The present invention is also applicable to the so called competitive binding technique for the colorimetric immunoassay of antigen to be detected in a biologically derived fluid sample. In this instance, the immobilized antibody is bound in a layer to a solid surface forming a solid phase in the same manner as set forth above. This solid phase is contacted with the biologically derived fluid containing antigen to be detected, and with free enzyme labeled antigen of the same type as the antigen to be detected. A competitive immunological reaction is caused to occur between the immobilized antibody and both a the antigen to be detected, and b the enzyme labeled antigen. That is, the concentration of antigen to be detected in the biologically derived fluid is inversely proportional to the enzyme labeled antigen bound to the solid phase. After the above competitive reaction, the solid phase from step a is separated from the liquid phase. Preferably, the surface is washed to remove unbound enzyme labeled antigen from the surface. Then, the separated solid phase is contacted with a solution containing soluble substrate for the enzyme, to cause the substrate to be converted into an insoluble form which deposits on the solid phase to impart a visually discernible color to it. The solid phase is separated from the substrate solution and is read as an inverse indication of the amount of antigen to be detected in the biologically derived sample. Thus, the color intensity on the solid surface increases with the decreasing presence of antigen to be detected. The description of the above details of operation and advantages of the present invention with respect to the sandwich technique are also applicable to the analogous competitive technique. An analogous reaction product for the competitive technique includes a reactive dipstick with a solid reaction surface portion. Bound to the surface portion is a layer of antibody, at least a portion of which is immunologically bonded to enzyme labeled antigen, and visually discernible colored substrate precipitated onto the layer. The substrate is of a type which has been converted from a soluble to a precipitated colored form due to the presence of the enzyme. As set forth above, suitable substrate solutions are of a type which generate an insoluble reaction product which precipitates on the dipstick or other solid surface. A particularly effective enzyme substrate combination is the alkaline phosphatase enzyme and its substrate, 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl phosphate commonly referred to as BCIP . This is a very stable phosphatase substrate which has been used as a histochemical stain for phosphatase activity in tissue sections. The enzymatic dephosphorylation of BCIP in amino alcohol buffer yields the indolyl 3 ol derivative, which dimerizes to yield a blue colored, insoluble product. Other substrates for alkaline phosphatase are set forth in the following Table 1 The following examples are illustrative of the present invention. This example demonstrates the immobilization of an antibody to α human luteinizing hormone on a 0.2 mm thick sheet the sheet of polyterephthalate ethylene glycol Mylar laminated with agar, and then forming a dipstick. The sheet is supplied under the trademark Gel Bond by FMC Bio Products, Rockland, Maine. The sheet was soaked in water for 5 minutes and the agarose coated portion to be coupled was soaked in a 20 mM aqueous solution of sodium meta periodate for 30 minutes at 20 24 c. Following removal from the periodate solution, the sheet was washed three times in deionized water, then incubated overnight at 2 8 C in a buffer solution 0.1M NaCO₃, 0.5M NaCl, pH 9.2 containing 50 µg ml of monoclonal antibody specific for α subunit of human luteinizing hormone hLH and human chorionic gonadotropin hCG at 2 8 C. The antibodies were obtained by the hybridization of splenic lymphocytes with mouse myeloma cells, followed by cloning according to the procedure described by Kohler and Milstein in The reacted sheet contained a uniform layer of antibody permanently bonded to the sheet. The sheets were dessicated overnight under vacuum and stored dry. The sheets were cut into 6 mm x 4 in. dipsticks using a paper cutter, and stored dessicated. White polystyrene sheets 4 in. x 11 1 4 in. x 1 32 in., formed by extrusion from Dow 484 or Cosden 825E polystyrene washed free of oils and grease, were coated by immersion of the wide 11 1 4 in. end into PBS containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.9 w v NaCl, pH 7.0, 5 µg ml of monoclonal antibody specific for α subunit of hLH and hCG. The sheets were immersed to a height of 15 mm in the coating solution and incubated for approximately 24 hours at room temperature. Excess antibody was washed off the sheets by dipping the sheets into PBS, using three changes of PBS. The washed sheets were dessicated overnight under vacuum. The dry sheets were cut into 6 mm x 4 in. dipsticks using a paper cutter, and stored dessicated. This example demonstrates the use of the dipsticks prepared in Example 2 to develop a calibration curve for a non competitive assay for hLH using simultaneous incubation of sample solid phase and labeled antibody. A stock solution of monoclonal antibody specific for β subunit of hLH was prepared according to the Kohler and Milstein procedure cited in Example 1. The antibodies were then conjugated to bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase according to the procedure described by E. Engvall in A solution 500 µl of human urine spiked with a known amount of hLH was then added and the mixture was agitated. Seven such solutions of human urine were used with concentrations ranging from 0.0 to 7.0 ng ml 0 to 60 mIU ml , at equal 10 mIU ml intervals, designated samples 1 through 7, respectively. A dipstick measuring 4.0 in. in length and 6 mm in width, with a portion extending 1.5 cm from one end coated on both sides with the α antibody, was cut from the sheet prepared in Example 2. The dipstick was placed in the reaction tube with the antibody coated portion fully submerged, and incubated thus at room temperature for thirty minutes. The dipstick was then removed and rinsed with a stream of tap water on both sides. Excess water was then shaken off and the dipstick was placed in 1.0 ml of a substrate solution consisting of 1.0 mg ml of BCIP 5 Bromo, 4 Chloro, 3 Indolyl Phosphate , and a suitable amino alcohol buffer, i.e., aminomethyl propanol, in a 10 mm x 75 mm culture tube at pH 9 11. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 60 minutes, at which time the dipstick was removed from the substrate and air dried, after blotting or rinsing with water. The results obtained from each of the seven spiked samples were as follows The sample 1 dipstick showed no color. The sample 2 dipstick showed a light blue color. The intensity of the color increased progressively from sample 2 through sample 7 in directed proportion to the hLH concentration. The hLH level of an unknown sample can be semiquantitated by visual comparison with the described reference dipsticks. Clear Mylar dipsticks were substituted for the dipsticks of Example 2 and used in the sandwich assay as described in Example 3. The blue dye deposited on the dipsticks was read spectrophotometrically by placing the colored end of the dipstick in the light path of a spectrophotometer. Where BCIP substrate was used the absorbence was read at 620 nm. In a series of tests using a one hour substrate incubation, the results of reading the clear dipsticks on a spectrophotometer are presented in the following table This example demonstrates the use of the dipsticks prepared in Example 1 to develop a calibration curve for a non competitive assay for hCG, using the forward sequential incubation of sample and solid phase, and second incubation with labeled antibody. A stock solution of monoclonal antibody specific for β subunit of hCG was prepared according to the Kohler and Milstein procedure cited in Example 1. The antibodies were then conjugated to bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase according to the procedure described by E. Engvall, cited in Example 3. The resulting conjugates had an enzyme to antibody ratio of approximately 2 1, and the final conjugate solution had a concentration of approximately 100 ng ml, based on active antibody diluted in 50 mM Tris HCl, .064 w v NaCl, 1 mg ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5,0.04 Tween 20. A 10 mm x 75 mm culture tube was charged with 1 ml of this solution. A dipstick measuring 4 in. in length and 6 mm in width, with a portion extending 1.5 cm from one end coated on both sides with the α antibody, was cut from the sheet prepared in Example 2. The dipstick was placed in each of six urine samples containing 0 200 ng ml hCG 0 1000 mIU ml with the antibody coated portion fully submerged, and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. The dipstick was then removed from the urine sample and incubated for 5 to 10 minutes in the 10 mm x 75 mm culture tube charged with enzyme conjugate at room temperature. The dipstick was then removed and washed in distilled or tap water by swirling the dipstick in a beaker. Excess water was then shaken off and the dipstick was placed in 1.0 ml of substrate solution consisting of 1 mg ml of BCIP and a suitable amino alcohol buffer such as aminomethyl propanol, in a 10 mm x 75 mm culture tube at pH 9 11. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 10 20 minutes, at which time the dipstick was removed from the substrate and air dried, after blotting or rinsing with water. The various levels of hCG in urine gave dipsticks with blue coloration directly proportional to the amount of hCG on the sample. The hCG negative urine sample gave a white or colorless dipstick. An unknown sample or a dilution of an unknown sample could be semi quantitated by visual comparison with the described reference dipsticks. Using a single calibrator at the desired cut off, qualitative results for pregnancy detection could be determined using this visual test. The test sensitivity could also be adjusted to set the visual detection limit to the desired cut off for a qualitative test. This example demonstrates the use of the dipsticks prepared as in Example 2 to develop a calibration curve for a competitive enzyme immunoassay for mouse IgG. Anti mouse IgG Fc specific prepared by ammonium sulfate fractionation from rabbit antisera was used to coat polystyrene sheets as in Example 2. Monoclonal mouse IgG₁ was coupled to bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase as described in Example 3. This alkaline phosphatase coupled mouse IgG₁ was used as the labeled antigen in the following competitive EIA for mouse IgG, after dilution 1 2000 in Assay Buffer 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, .064 NaCl, 0.04 Tween 20, 1 mg ml bovine serum albumin . A solution 100 µl of mouse IgG₁ in phosphate buffered saline 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.9 NaCl containing various levels of IgG₁, was added to a 10 mm x 75 mm culture tube charged with 900 µl of the labeled antigen in Assay Buffer, and the mixture was agitated. Six such solutions of mouse IgG₁ were used, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.1 mg ml. A dipstick measuring 4 in. in length and 6 mm in width, with a portion extending 2.0 cm from one end coated on both sides with anti mouse IgG Fc specific , was cut from the sheet prepared as described above. The dipstick was placed in the reaction tube with the antibody coated portion fully submerged, and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The stick was then removed and rinsed briefly in tap water on each side. Excess water was then shaken off, and the dipstick was placed in 1.0 ml of substrate solution consisting of 1.0 mg ml BCIP in a suitable amino alcohol buffer such as aminomethyl propanol, pH 9 11. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 10 minutes, at which time the dipstick was removed from the substrate. The dipstick was air dried after gentle blotting. There was an inverse relationship between blue color intensity on the dipstick and the level of mouse IgG in the sample. It is possible to semiquantitate an unknown sample or dilution of an unknown sample by visual comparison with the reference dipsticks.
