# Electronic game referring to the one of the roller with light scan to stop by control impulse on compartment of sector to prearrange.

## Abstract
On a luminous diagram, the game foresees a circular image consisting of a crown composed of two type compart ments in alternating arrangement and having different colouring, and inside of another crown with radial corre spondence compartments which, when the device is ac tivated, is crossed by a light scan with only one passage. By means of one of the two pushbuttons referred to the above series, the player transmits the stop impulse to the scan when this one is crossing a pre arranged sector. When the impulse is transmitted by the pushbuttom foreseen for the compartment type, the game is won at a higher level. In subsequent sequences of the same cycle of the game, the reduction of the compartment sector amplitude can be taken into consideration in order to increase the difficult of the trial.

Between these two pairs of points, the numbers 10 of scale from 0 to 36 are indicated. Inside, crown 11 is foreseen subdivided in as many coepertments 12, in each compartment an illuminable point 12 is present. On the circular surface 14, the digit numerator 4 with four figures is foreseen and an indication 15 pointing out the overcoming of the muIrmum score required for allowing the repeti tion of the last sequence. 3 Electr3nic game referring to tile one of the roller with light scan to stop by control impulse on compartment of sector to prearange, according to the previous claims, characterized by the fact that outside, on the circular image 16, the visualization of the points obtained after the first trial is foreseen in 17, the value of the score after the second trial, if positive is so in 18, the one of third positive trial in 19, and in 20 from the fourth trial if positive too. in 21 a light indication is foreseen which informs that the first winnings level has been reached in 22 another indication concerns the second winnings level, in 23 a third light indication is for the third winnings, and in 24 the indication that another coin can be inserted slice the pre vious phase is exhausted. 4 Electronic game referring to the one of the roller with light scan to stop by control impulse on compartment of sector to prearrange, according to the previous claims, characterized by the fact that on part 25, the pushbutton controls 26 and 27 are fitted for stopping the luminous impulse on the crown 11 points. Above the pushbuttons, the writings 28 and 29 are foreseen which state the moment in which it is to press. One of these writings lights suddently up indicating the colour of correspondence of the pushbutton. 5 Electronic game referring to the one of the roller with light scan to stop by control impulse on compartment of sector to prearrange, according to the previous claims, characterized by the fact that when the machene has been activated, the inscription at point 17 lights up, the indication 28 and 29 are lighted, and the interception sector consisting of a given number of compartments 7 becomes evident in occasional position. On crown 11, the luminous scan is determined by the successive lighting up of the points 13, and tile perception of the roller rotation is ingenerated, while th sound is heard from the loud speaker. The player has to push one of the buttons 26 and 27 according to the colour of the coirqtment on which he wants to stop the luminous scan. If the impulse stop occurs in the sector established beforehand and in the conarteent having the colour of the control, on the digi tal numerator 4 a doubled score is determined in comparison with the one indicated at point 17. If no colour correspondence occurs between the used control and the stop compartment, the only score foreseen on indicator 17 is registered on numerator 4. 6 Electronic game referring to the one of the roller with light scan to stop by control impulse on compartment of sector prearrange, according to the previous claims, characterized by the fact that a luminous band is reactivated which consists of a smaller number of compar tments than the previous one, the light scan is put in motion again and signal 18 is lighted up. The player must use again one of the pushbutbonc The result of the second trial brings to a number change on the numerator 4. 7 Electronic game referring to the one of the roller with light scan to stop by control impulse on oompartnent of sector to prearrange, according to the previous claims, characterized by the fact that the third trial occurs on an interception sector consisting of a still small er number of ooepartments, while the light scan speed is reduced owing to the adjustment to the correspondence of reflex action. The plyer carries out also this trial and passes on the fourth and last one. In this last trial, when the scan on the interception sector does not stop, it turns out to be negative and, from the numerator 4, as many points are detracted as they were foreseen by the trial if positive. At the end of the fourth trial, if on the numerator 4 the number established in advance for that sequence has been reached or overcome, a count down begins on the same numerator indicating the time at disposal for the prosecution of the game by introducing an additional coin. When the preestablished score has been reache and overcome, signallings 15 and 24 light up. 8 Electroni game referring to the one of the roller with light scan to stop by control impulse on caiparament of sector prearrarge, according to the previouc claims, characterized by the fact that by introducing a secondo coin, the last trial can be played again trying to reach the scores foreseen for the first, second and third winnings level. When a level has been reached and the player does not intend to go on in order to reach the sebsequent ones, the machi ne is put again in the position to allow further starts and carries out the countdown, gives an acustic signal and visualized the obtained winning on the signaller 21. If the impulse is not stopped in the interception sector on the counter, points will be deducted corppnding to the ones foreseen for overcoming the trial until zero points are reached. 9 Electronic game referring to the one of the roller with light scan to stop by control impulse on compartment of sector prearrange, accor ding to the previous claims, characterized by the fact that the mac m ne has a menory fed bxy a battery recording collections and payments it is foreseen for payments not exceeding a given percentage of the collections made up to that moment. If at the moment of the winnings, the payment should exceed this level, the machine prevents the conco mitance of positions and colours determining the winnings. In such situation, a score below the level will be got which would determine such winnings, however near it. By inserting another coin, the available no ney in the machine will be increased and brought beyond the guard level. 10 Electronic game referring to the one of the roller with light scan to stop by control impulse on compartment of sector prearrange, according to the previous claims, characterized by the fact that the machine is programmed for carrying out payments even if the guard level has been overcome by carrying out a casual calculation, memorizing the pay ment exceeding level and, at a certain point, by intervening for blocking them. This prevents from learining the programming by the players who in thus way could intervene at the right moment, namely when other players have obtained no winnings.

## Description
Electronic game referring to the one of the roller with light scan to stop by control impulse on ccawxlrtment of setoree . The invention refers to an electronic game based on the speed of the mental reflex action. The player catches the image of a luminous scan which is moving on a circular track, and he must intervene to control the stop by prearranging the intervention compartment within the limits of a sector determined in advance.The game foresees a drawing on a luminous diagram by scheme perception for the roller game, which outside consists of a crown divided in cam partments of two types in alternating arrangement and with different colouring, and inside another crown subdivided into as many compartments and having radial correspondence with the first ones. Each compartment of the inside crown is centrally foreseen with a point that can be light ed and having other two points to be lighted with radial correspondence on the relevant outer compartment one of these points can be activated by means of a pushbutton foreseen for the compartments of that colour, whereas the other ones is activated by means of the pushbutton foreseen for the compartments of the other colour.The player activated the plant by means of a chip or coin and keeps wait ing laying his fingers on then pushbuttons foreseen on the diagram When the light scan appears which results from the impulse succession for the points to illuminate on the inside crown carried out by the installation, the payer will try and stop it within an allowed sector and properly lit ted, by interning on the pushbuttom of the type corresponding to the presumed interception caiparooent. If the impulse has been transmitted within the foreseen sector, the scan will stop on the intercepted point and, on the insistence comparment, the point will be lighted up which corresponds to the pushbutton that carried out the stop.The visualized drawing on the luminous diagram and the image of the light scan rotating in it similar to a moving ball, causes total perception of conventional roller game. This perception is increased by the sound emitted by the loudspeaker fitted inside the said mechanical movement. The proof is overcome at a hd her score level when the luminous scan is stopped within the limits of the foreseen sector and by using the pushbutton ocmpatible with the type of compartment used for the interception.The game can be repeated for more sequences and for each one of them in progression the width of the interception section is reduced and, correspondingly, the speed of the light scan by an adjustment to the impulse relative speed. The score obtained is computurized after each operative sequence by an electronic counter and can be noted on the illuminated diagram on digital indicators.A form of the machine is illustrated in a merely indicative way by the drawing of Table I Fig. 1.The version foresees the activation of the plant by means of chip or coin introduced by the player into the slot 1. An acustic signal the the loudspeaker 2 indicated that the game has been begun, at the present time, on the diagram 3, on the electronic counter 4 the four figure digital indicators are cleared. The roller has outside the crown 5 operating at perception of higher containment border of the components the game scheme. The perception of these components is given by the outer crown 6 divided in thirty seven compartments 7 in each of them two illuminable points 8 and 9 are foreseen fitted on the same radial and on two concentric circles.Between these two pairs of points, the numbers 10 of a scale from 0 to 36 are indicated. Inside, crown 11 is foreseen subdivided in as many compartments 12, in each com partment an illuminable point 12 is present. On the circular surface 14, the digit numerator 4 with four figures is foreseen and an indication 15 pointing out the overcoming of the minimum score required for allowing the repetition of the last sequence. Outside, on the circular image 16, the visualization of the points obtained after the first trial is forese en in 17, the value of the score after the second trial, if positive, is so in 18, the one of third positive trial in 19, and in 20 from the four th trial if positive too.In 21 a light indication is foreseen which informs that the first winnings level has been reached in 22 another indications concerns the second winnings level, in 23 a third light indication is for the third winnings, and in 24 the indication that another coin can be inserted since the previous phase is exhausted. On part 25, the pushbut tom controls 26 and 27 are fitted for stopping the luminous impulse on the crown 11 points. Above the pushbuttons, the writings 28 and 29 are foreseen which state the moment in which it is to press. One of these writings lights suddently up indicating the colour of correspondence of the pushbuttam. When the machine has been activated, the inscription at point 17 lights up, the indications 28 and 29 are lighted, and the interception sector consisting of a given number of compartments 7 becomes evident in occasional position. On crown 11, the luminous scan is determined by the successive lighting up of the point 13, and the perception of the roller rotation is ingenerated, while the sound is heard form the loudspeaker. The player has to push one of the buttons 26 and 27 according to the colour of the compartment on which he wants to stop the luminous scan.If the impulse stop occurs in the sector established beforehand and in the compartment having the colour of the control, on the digital numerator 4 a doubled score is determined in comparison with the one indicated at point 17. If no colour correspondence occurs between the used control and the stop compartment, the only score foreseen on indicator 17 is registered on numerator 4. The machine allows to visualize the result obtained on the numerator during some seconds successively, a ltnarus band is reactivated which con sists of a smaller niiber of or apartments than the previous one, the lig ht scan is put in motion again and signal 18 is lighted up. The player must use again one of the pushbuttons. The result of the second trial brings to a number change on the numerator 4. The third trial occurs on an interception sector consisting of a still smaller number of c y t ments, while the light scan speed is reduced owing to the adjustment to the correspondence of reflex action. The player carries out also this trial and passes on the fourth and last one.In this last trial, when the scan on the interception sector does not stop, it turns out to be negati ve and, from the numerator 4, as many points are detracted as they were foreseen by the trial if positive. At the end of the fourth trial, if on the numerator 4 the number established in advance for that sequence has been reached or overcome, a count dbwn begins on the same numerator indicating the time at disposal for the prosecution of the game by inproducing an additional coin. When the pre established score has been reached and overcome, signallings 15 and 24 light up.By introducing a second coin, the last trial can be played again trying to reach the scores foreseen for the first, second and third winnings level. When a level has been reached and the player does not intend to go on in order to reach the subsequent ones, the machine is put again in the position to allow further starts and carries out the count down, gives an acustic signal and visualizes the obtained winning on the signaller 21. If the impulse is not stopped in the interception sector on the counter, points will be deducted corresponding to the oners foreseen for oveexxlling the trial until zero points are reached. The machine has a iniry fel by a battery recording collections and payments it is foreseen for payments not exceeding a given percentage of the collections made up to that moment. If at the nsconerrt of the winnings, the payment should exceed this level, the machine prevents the concomitance of positions and colours determining the winnings. In such situation, a score below the level will be got which would determine such winnings, however near it. By inserting another coin, the available money in the machine will be increased and brought beyond the guard level. The machine is programmed for carrying out payment even if the guard level hase been overcome by carrying out a casual calculation, memorizind the payment exceeding level and, at a certain point, by intervening for blocking them. This prevents from learning the programming by the players who in thus way could intervene at the right moment, namely when other players have obtained no winnings.
