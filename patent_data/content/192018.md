## Description
HIGH PRECISION ELECTRONIC THERMOSTATIC CONTROLLER FORGENERAL APPLICATION The present invention relates to thermostatic controllers, and more particularly to high precision electronic controllers. The desirability of maintaining a given temperature within a certain space or a body is quite obvious. Generally, the narrower the temperature range, the more expensive the controller becomes. In US A 4.405.080 issued to Kompelien in 1983, an electronic temperature control from a mechanical temperature responsive means is disclosed. The device uses a bimetal to sense the temperature and makes the disk member rotate which in turn causes the built on capacitive members to produce an unbalance that is later on amplified and passed through a phase discriminator. However, the precision of this approach is not as high as in the present invention because, among other reasons, the components are all susceptible to temperature changes themselves and the bimetal sensor is inherently inaccurate. As the inventor points out in said patent, first paragraph of column 1, electronic thermostats that use thermistors are presently being used but there are problems with the components used that make them unstable. Kompelien s attempt to solve the problem by replacing the thermistors with capacitive components complicated the design with less precise components, namely the bimetal sensor used. Here, the problem documented by Kompelien s is resolved by providing a circuit that allows the sensitivity of the device to come within one thousandth of one degree centigrade with relatively common components and an ingenious circuit combination. Other patents describing the closest subject matter provide for a number of more or less complicated features that fail to solve the problem in an efficient and economical way. None of these patents suggest the novel features of the present invention. An object of the invention is to provide a high precision electronic thermostatic controller for general application, composed by a stabilized voltage power supply connected to a resistance network and a voltage comparator or operational amplifier connected to a static or electromagnetic relay. Another object of the invention is a high precision electronic thermostatic controller for general application, which can be equipped with a control for the temperature hysteresis of the on off switching. Another object of the invention is a high precision electronic thermostatic controller for general application, in which the resistance network is aWheatstone bridge with one or more resistors variable with the temperature and, at least, a setting potentiometer that can be located in any of the bridge arms or with the variable contact being the bridge top vertex. Another object of the invention is a high precision electronic thermostatic controller for general application, in which the temperature variable resistors are the temperature transducers to be located in the proper places outside of the set and connected to it. Another object of the invention is a high precision electronic thermostatic controller for general application which, when intended for independent setting, with the same transducer, of the on off temperature switching, uses a twin Wheat stone bridge containing one temperature variable resistor and two setting potentiometers located in outside arms of the twin bridge. Another object of the invention is a high precision electronic thermostatic controller for general application which uses as bridge discriminators voltage comparator electronic circuits or operational amplifiers. Another object of the invention is a high precision electronic thermostaWic controller for general application in which the discriminators are protected against temperature transducers connections, short circuits or open circuits by voltage limiting diodes and by proper selection of the Wheatstone bridge resistance values. Another object of the invention is a high precision electronic thermostatic controller for general application provided with an output relay static or electromagnetic operated by the discriminator signal to control the power supply to the consumers. Another object of the invention is a high precision electronic thermostatic controller for general application which, in the very high precision version laboratory type level version is for all practical effects insensitive to ambient temperature fluctuations as it is installed in a stabilized temperature thermostatic chamber this version is equipped with electromagnetic shielding. On the drawings, Figure 1 is a schematic drawing of the thermostatic controller according to one embodiment of the invention, Figure 2 is a schematic drawing of another embodiment of the invention, and Figure 3 represents still another embodiment of the invention. The basic technical characteristics of the embodiments of the invention comprise 1. Stabilized voltage rectifier composed of a Transformer with input voltage in accordance with the network voltage b Secundary voltage rectifier c High precision voltage stabilizer for power supply of components or voltage supply from any D.C. stabilized source.2. Resistance network connected in Wheatstone bridge or twin Wheatstone bridge according to the cases composed by a one or more resistances variable with the temperature to be controlled transducers The transducers used must be in accordance with the ambient conditions where they are going to be installed as well as with the temperature range to be controlled.b one or more adjusting potentiometers.c several complementary fixed resistors.3. Wheatstone bridge discriminators composed by electronic voltage comparators or operational amplifiers.4. Output control relay operated by the discriminators above referred in 3 with optional state indicator.5. Protections a Imput fuse for overall protection.b Fuse for protection of the electronic components.c Voltage limiting diodes for discriminator protection against temperature transducers connection faults, protection effectively obtained by proper relationship with the Wheatstone resistance values. The temperature hysteresis as well as the slue rate are dependent, firstly from the transducers resistance slope, and secondly from the thermal inertia of the same transducers. The slue rate of the equipment under question is far higher than the thermal inertia of the above referred transducers, having no practical influence in the response time of the whole assembly. For operation in the absolute temperature mode a single transducer in enough, while for operation in the differential temperature mode relative temperature two transducers are used. Referring now to the drawings, the basic version of the thermostatic controller according to the invention is shown in Figure 1, and comprises a stabilized voltage power supply 1 , a Wheatstone bridge resistance network 2 , including transducers 3 and a potentiometer 4 , voltage limiting diodes 5 , a discriminator 6 and a static or electromagnetic relay 7 .A Physical characteristics The device is realized as Assembly box with power plug and socket with or without ground connector. One adjusting potentiometer and two bipolar sockets preferably of the coaxial type for the temperature transducers connection. It can also include Optional optical state indication. Optional hysteresis control when intended for use with equipments that should not be submitted to frequent on off switching.B Technical characteristics Great insensitivity to power supply voltage fluctuations. Very low sensitivity to changes of ambient temperature. When the hysteresis control is not installed or is out of circuit the precision of this controller at 250 centigrade is of the order of the hundreth of a centigrade degree. The hysteresis can be easily implemented for temperature differences of several degrees, keeping the above referred precision for the on and off temperature operations. A version with smaler hysteresis can be easily obtained by the addition of a standard electronic component.
