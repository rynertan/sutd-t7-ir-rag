# WIRE ELECTRODE CLAMPING MECHANISM FOR WIRE CUT ELECTRIC DISCHARGE MACHINE.

## Abstract
A wire electrode clamping mechanism in an apparatus for drawing a wire out of a wire cut electric discharge ma chine includes a wire guide pipe 113 which guides a wire electrode 2 a pipe holder 112 which vertically movably receives the upper portion of the wire guide pipe 113 and a clamping member 111 which is disposed on the upper side of the pipe holder 112 and which is actuated such as to unclamp the wire electrode 2 by the wire guide pipe 113 and an actuating member 12 at the lower and upper limits, respectively, of the vertical movement of the clamp ing member 111 . The clamping member 111 clamps the wire electrode 2 being received through the wire guide pipe so as to pull up the wire electrode 2 .
