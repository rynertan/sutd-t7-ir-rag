# Electric motor powered actuator.

## Abstract
An electric motor powered actuator 26 in which a shaft 110 has a threaded connection with the rotor 60 of an electric motor whereby rotation of the rotor causes axial translation of the shaft. The shaft is urged in one direction by a compression spring 116 and the compression spring is interposed between the shaft and a spacer ring 94 that engages one of the thrust bearings 74 for the motor rotor. The compression spring has nonrotatable connections 118, 122 with the shaft 110 and motor housing 28 such that the torsional force of the spring prevents rotation of the shaft 110 relative to the motor housing 28 when the motor rotor is rotated.
