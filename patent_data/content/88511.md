# Improvements in or relating to aluminium alloys.

## Abstract
Aluminium alloys having compositions within the ranges in wt 2 to 2.8 lithium 0.4 to 1 magnesium 1 to 1.5 copper 0 to 0.2 zirconium 0 to 0.5 manganese 0 to 0.5 nickel 0 to 0.5 chromium balance aluminium. The alloys are precipitation hardenable and exhibit a range of properties, according to heat treatment, which make them suitable for engineering applications where light weight and high strength are required.
