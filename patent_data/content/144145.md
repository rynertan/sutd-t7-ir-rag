## Abstract
The height of a piston for an internal combustion engine is reduced by the provision of gudgeon pin bores which intersect or at least partly intersect a ring band extending around the crown. This allows the mass of the piston to be reduced and allows improved visibility from the vehicle owing to reduced bonnet height. The weight of the piston is reduced so improving its performance and the performance of the engine.

## Description
IMPROVEENTS IN OR RELATING TO PISTONSThe invention relates to pistons for internal combustion engines of the kind comprising a crown, a ring band extending around the crown and including two or more piston ring grooves, and a pair of co axial gudgeon pin bores which receive a gudgeon pin by which the piston is attached to an associated connecting rod.Such a piston also has a skirt which depends from the ring band and which is intersected by the gudgeon pin bores. The lower edge of the skirt defines the lower edge of the piston. In use, the piston reciprocates in an associated cylinder or liner formed in an engine block and, for a given stroke of the piston, the height of the block, and consequently the mass of the block is determined at least in part by the axial length of the piston from the crown to the lower edge the shorter the axial length, the lower the height of the block.According to the invention, there is provided a piston for an internal combustion engine, comprising a crown surrounded by a ring band including two or more axially spaced piston ring grooves and a pair of co axial bores for receiving a gudgeon pin, the gudgeon pin bores at least partly intersecting the ring band.According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a piston for an internal combustion engine and including separately formed upper and lower parts, the upper part defining a crown, at least part of a ring band and two gudgeon pin bores whose radially outer ends terminate radially inwardly of the ring band and the lower part defining a downward continuation of the at least a part of the ring band and covering the outer ends of the gudgeon pin bores.According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a piston for an internal combustion engine and comprising two interconnected parts, a first of the parts forming a portion of a crown of the piston and a pair of gudgeon pin bosses depending therefrom, and the second of the parts forming a ring band of the piston and having a hollow interior which receives the first part, so that the crown portion of the first part is level with the upper end of the second part, which thus forms an outer periphery of the crown.According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a piston for an internal combustion engine comprising a crown surrounded by a ring band including two or more axially spaced piston ring grooves and a pair of co axial bores for receiving a gudgeon pin, the gudgeon pin bores being spaced equidistantly or substantially equidistantly from the crown and a lower edge of the piston.The following is a more detailed description of six embodiments of the invention, by way of example, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a side elevation, partly in section, of a first form of piston for an internal combustion engine,Figure 2 is a side elevation, partly in section, of a second form of piston for an internal combustion engine,Figure 3 is a side elevation, partly in section, of a third firm of piston for an internal combustion engine, the piston being formed in two parts,Figure 4 is a section on the line IV IV of Figure 3, andFigure 5 is an underneath plan view of the piston ofFigures 3 and 4, the lower half of this view being in section,Figure 6 is a cross section of a fourth form of piston for an internal combustion engine and formed in three separate parts,Figure 7 is a cross section of a fifth form of piston for an internal combustion engine and formed in two parts, without a skirt, andFigure 8 is a cross section of a sixth form of piston for an internal combustion engine having an inner crown and gudgeon pin bore formed in a first part and a ring band and a skirt formed in a second part.Referring first to Figure 1, the first form of piston is cast or forged from aluminium or aluminium alloy for example it may be made by a squeeze casting process. The piston comprises a crown 10 surrounded by a ring band 11 and supported by a gudgeon pin boss 12 defining a pair of co axial gudgeon pin bores 13 whose axis extends diametrically across the piston. The ring band 11 has a generally cylindrical surface in which are formed upper and lower piston ring grooves 14, 15. The grooves 14, 15 lie in respective planes normal to the piston axis and above and below the gudgeon pin bores 13, as seen in Figure 1.The upper piston ring groove 14 is for receiving a compression ring not shown which seals against the associated cylinder or liner not shown to prevent or substantially prevent gases from the combustion chamber passing between the ring band and the associated cylinder or liner. The lower piston ring groove 15 receives a combined compression and oil scraper ring not shown for both sealing against the associated cylinder or liner to prevent the downward passage of gases into a crankcase of the engine and for controlling the thickness of the oil film on the cylinder or liner. This combined ring may be of any suitable design and may be made from a plastics material, for example, polyetheretherketone or a material including polyetheretherketone.It will be seen that the upper and lower piston ring grooves 14, 15 in the embodiment shown in Figure 1 are widely spaced with the upper groove 14 being close to the crown 10 and the lower groove 15 being close to the lower edge 16 of the piston. In use, this wide spacing of the piston ring grooves allows the upper and lower piston rings to form an expansion chamber 17, therebetween which is also bounded by the cylinder, the cylinder or liner wall and the ring band. The start of the bores 13 also adds to the volume of this chamber 17. This expansion chamber 17 receives any gases which blow by the upper compression ring in the upper ring groove 14.Because of the volume of this chamber, the pressure of these gases is reduced substantially, which reduces the gas pressure on the lower combined compression oil scraper ring in the lower ring groove and thus increases the effectiveness of the ring.The position of the gudgeon pin bores 13 between the upper and lower piston ring grooves 14, 15 means that the ends of the bores 13 on the ring band are exposed to those gases under pressure which blow by the upper compression ring. For this reason, the gudgeon pin not shown which is received within the bores 13 to connect the piston to an associated connecting rod not shown , is made to be a tight fit in said bores 13 to prevent the passage of gases between the bores 13 and the pin and into the crankcase. For this purpose, the gudgeon pin may be made of an austenitic steel which has a coefficient of thermal expansion substantially equal to the coefficient of thermal expansion of the aluminium or aluminium alloy of the piston.As will be seen, there is no skirt in this embodiment, the lateral thrust loads on the piston being taken by the ring band 11.Referring next to Figure 2, in this embodiment the piston is once again cast or forged from aluminium or an aluminium alloy for example it may be made by a squeeze casting process. The piston comprises a crown 20 surrounded by a ring band 21. A gudgeon pin boss 22 defines a pair of co axial gudgeon pin bores 23 and supports the crown 20 and ring band 2 on flanges 24. A skirt is formed by two pairs of arcuate skirt portions 25a, 25b 26a, 26b arranged on opposite sides of a plane including the piston axis and the gudgeon pin bore axis. The upper skirt portions 25a, 26a, of each pair depend from the ring band 21 while the lower skirt portions 25b, 26b are carried on the ends of limbs 27 extending from the gudgeon pin boss 22.The ring band 21 is provided with three piston ring grooves 28, 29, 30, with each groove comprising upper and lower axially spaced radially extending side walls 31, 32 connected by a base 33. In the case of the two upper piston ring grooves 28, 29 the walls 31, 32 and the base 33 are continuous around the whole circumference of the piston. In the case of the lower piston ring groove 30, however, the gudgeon pin bores 23 are so arranged that they intersect the lower wall 32 and the base 33 of this groove 30 at diametrically opposed points on the circumference of the ring band 21.The two upper piston ring grooves 28, 29 contain compression rings not shown of any suitable conventional design while the lower groove 30 contains an oil scraper ring not shown of any suitable of conventional design. Although the oil scraper ring will be unsupported on one side for a part of its circumference, this has not, in general, been found to be a problem. If there is any problem, a clip on support may be provided which spans the gap to support this part of the ring. In addition, the ring may be positively located to prevent its rotational movement, thus preventing a gap provided in the ring from coinciding with the gap in the lower side wall 32.The gudgeon pin not shown can also be of conventional design since there is no problem with the passage of gases between the gudgeon pin and the gudgeon pin bores 13 due to the two compression rings above the gudgeon pin bores 13. Referring next to Figures 3, 4 and 5, the third piston is formed in two parts and upper part 40 and a lower part 41. These may be forged or cast, particularly squeeze cast, from aluminium or aluminium alloys. The material may be the same for both parts or different. Alternatively, the upper part can be made from a suitable metallic material and the lower part from a suitable plastics material.The upper part 40 defines a crown 42 and the upper portion of a ring band 43 which includes two piston ring grooves 44, 45 extending around the ring band 43. The upper part 40 also defines two gudgeon pin bores 46, 47 whose radially outer ends terminate inwardly of the ring band 43 see Fig.11 . At the lower edge of the ring band 43, there is an inwardly directed step 48 leading to a generally cylindrical surface 49 extending around the gudgeon pin bores 46, 47 see Figs. 3 and 5 .The lower part 41 is formed as a sleeve and includes, at the upper end thereof, a piston ring groove 50. The outer surface 51 of the sleeve 41 forms a skirt for the piston. The inner surface of the sleeve is formed with an annular cavity 52 which forms a heat barrier. The sleeve 41 is a sliding fit over the generally cylindrical surface 49 of the upper part 40, so that the top of the sleeve sits in the step 48 and the outer surface of the ring band 43 is contiguous with the outer surface 51 of the sleeve. The sleeve 41 is connected to the upper part 40 in any convenient way, for example by welding, particularly by friction welding, or by gluing or by shrinking, or by screwing or by the use of releasable mechanical locking means. An example of the latter is a tab washer or screws 55 as seen in Figure 3.It will be seen that the sleeve 41 covers the open ends of the gudgeon pin bores 46, 47 and that an imaginary extension of the gudgeon pin bores partially intersects the lower part of the ring band and the piston ring groove 50 formed on the sleeve. It will be appreciated, however, that the sleeve 41 need not be formed in one piece, it could be formed in two or more pieces.Where the sleeve is in one piece, the gudgeon pin not shown must be pressed through the gudgeon pin bores and the little end of the connecting rod before the sleeve 41 is fitted over the upper part 40 of the piston.Referring next to Figure 6, the fourth piston is formed in three parts 60, 61, 62. The first part 60 includes an inner circular portion 63 of the crown and gudgeon pin bosses 64 which depend from the undersurface of this crown portion 63. The second part 61 includes a ring band 65 formed with three piston rings 66 and is generally cylindrical with an interior diameter equal to the diameter of the crown portion 63 of the first part 60 so that this crown portion 63 can be inserted into the second part 61 until level with a top surface 67 of the second portion, so that this top surface forms the outer periphery of the crown. The two parts can be fixed together by, for example, a laser or electron beam welding technique, or by gluing, screwing or interference fitting or any other suitable technique.The third part 62 is cylindrical and forms a skirt of the piston. It is fixed to the lower edge of the second part 61 by any suitable process, for example by welding as described above.As will be seen, the relative dimensions of the parts 60, 61, 62 are such that the bores in the gudgeon pin bosses 64, if extended, intersect the ring band 65, which thus closes the ends of these bores. Referring next to Figure 7, the fifth piston has parts common with the fourth piston, shown in Figure 6. Such common parts will not be described in detail and will be given the same reference numerals. In the fifth piston, the skirt part 62 is omitted so that the lateral thrust loads are taken in part by the ring band 65. The remaining lateral thrust loads are taken by skirt pads 66 carried on limbs 69 projecting from the gudgeon pin bosses 64, in the manner of the Figure 2 embodiment.Referring next to Figure 8, the sixth piston is formed in two parts 70, 71. The first part 70 includes an inner circular portion 72 of the crown of the piston and gudgeon pin bosses 73 which depend from the undersurface of this crown portion 72. In addition, there a ring 74 connected to the lower edges of the bosses 73 and formed with a rebate 75 at its outer edge.The second part 71 is generally cylindrical and provides a ring band 76, including three piston ring grooves 77, and a skirt 78 depending therefrom. The interior of this part includes a step 79 and has an upper diameter equal to the diameter of the crown portin 72. the positions of the step 79 and the rebate 75 are such that, when the crown portion 72 is pushed up into the second part, the rebate 75 engages the step 79 when the crown portion 72 is level with the end of the second part 71, so that this end forms the outer periphery of the crown. The two parts are thus reliably located in their required positions. They are then fixed together by any suitable process, such as the brazing, welding, gluing or screwing processes described above. It will be seen that in all the embodiments described above with reference to the drawings, the gudgeon pin bores are very close to the crown end of the piston. This means that the overall axial length of the piston from the crown 10 20 to the lower edge can be decreased. For example, the axial length of the piston may be 50X to 70 of the diameter of the piston.This has the advantage that the compression height i.e.the distance between the axes of the gudgeon pin bores 13, 23 and the top of the crown of the piston is minimised, which is a desirable object in piston design.This has the benefit that, for a given stroke of engine, the height of the engine can be decreased. This will give a smaller engine which decreases the weight of the vehicle and also lowers the bonnet line of the vehicle.This can allow styling improvements to be made and will also increase the drivers forward visibility from the interior of the vehicle. Further, the piston is short and light which decreases its inertia and increases its acceleration so improving the performance of the engine.A further advantage of these arrangements is that they allow a gudgeon pin to be used which is of relatively large diameter without increasing the compression height of the piston. It will also be seen that the gudgeon pin bore is arranged substantially equidistantly between the crown and the lower edge of the piston in both the embodiments described above with reference to the drawings. This means that the piston is, in use, better balanced, and requires less barrelling of the associated cylinder or liner.A particular benefit of the third to sixth pistons Figs. 3 to 8 is that they allow the gudgeon pin bores to be moved well up into the ring band region without affecting the support given to the piston rings by the piston ring grooves. As will be seen, there is support for the lowermost piston ring around the whole circumference of the piston. In the third piston Figs. 3 to 5 the presence of the gap between the upper and lower parts 40, 41 means that the lower part will be cool.
