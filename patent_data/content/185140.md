# Disk playback apparatus.

## Abstract
A recorded disk playback apparatus in accordance with the present invention includes a sub chassis 126 whose one end is supported as turntable by the main chassis 124 that is housed in a main frame, a carriage 156 which is freely movable on the sub chassis 126 to feed the pick up head 154 in the radial direction of the recorded disk 14 , a turn table 16 which is placed on the sub chassis 126 to have the record disk placed on it, a slide table 122 which transports the record disk to the position which coincides with the center of rotation of the turn table 16 , a disk clamper 24 which is fixed rotatably to the main chassis 124 , an adjustable mechanism 164,178 which moves the carriage 156 , as well as turns upward downward the sub chassis 126 , a driving motor 166 which, by the driving of the adjusting mechanism, serves commonly for the feeding drive of the pick up head 154 and the turning drive of the sub chassis 126 , and a locking unlocking mechanism which locks unlocks the slide table in association with the operation of the adjusting mechanism. The engagement disengagement of the disk clamper 24 with respect to the recorded disk which is placed on the turn table is controlled by the raising lowering drive of the sub chassis. The adjusting mechanism may comprise a rack which moves in the radial direction of the recorded disk under the power of the driving motor, a stopper which defines the range of operation of the carriage, a linking mechanism which makes the linkage possible between the rack and the carriage within the range of operation of the carriage, and a raising lowering mechanism which raises lowers the sub chassis in association with the shifting operation of the rack.
