# Line protector for a communications circuit.

## Abstract
A line protector for a communications circuit com prises an insulating base 6 having a ground pin 16 and two pairs of line pins 8, 10 12, 14 , one pair for each side of the line, projecting through the base. Each pair of line pins has a contact 20, 20a electrically connected thereto and projecting away from the base. The ground pin also has a contact 22 projecting away from the base and spaced from the line pin contacts. A metal oxide va ristor 24 having opposed faces 26, 28 provides surge voltage protection for each side of the line. The line pin contacts are bonded to one face 28 of the varistor while the ground pin contact is bonded to the other face 26 of the varistor. Electrically conductive spring clips 30, 32 span the varistor and are pressed toward its opposite faces and in electrical contact with the ground pin con tact 22 . An insulating sheet 34 is interposed between the clips and the line pin contacts to prevent one or more of the clips from grounding the line except in such surge condition that heats the varistor sufficiently to melt the insulation 34 .
