# Keyboard joyswitch.

## Abstract
The present invention is a joyswitch which has a polygonally shaped switch plate having an even number of equilateral sides. Adjacent alternate sides of the switch plate there is a directional switch, which if activated by depressing the side of the switch plate thereabove will cause a selected indicia on a CRT screen to move along the directional vector associated with that switch in the firmware of the CRT device. If pressure is applied to a side of the switch plate not directly above one of the directional switches the two directional switches adjacent the depressed side will be activated causing the selected indicia on a CRT screen to move along a vector which is the geometric sum of the directional vectors associated with the two activated switches in the firmware of the CRT device.

## Description
KEYBOARD JOYSWITCH Background of the Invention This invention is related to cursor controls forCRT displays, namely joystick controls for movement of the cursor to a desired position. There are two types of prior art joysticks. One type has two linear potentiometers mounted at 90 to each other with each coupled to the end of the joystick shaft. One of the potentiometers is connected to control the up and down motion of the cursor and the other the left and right motion of the cursor on theCRT. As the shaft is moved manually from one position to another, the resistance of one or both potentiometers varies proportionally to that movement with respect to the orientation of each potentiometer. With the joystick the cursor can be relocated to any position on the CRT screen with its position being determined by the effective resistant of each potentiometer for the new joystick shaft position. The second type of joystick is one which incorporates four directional switches, one each for the up, down, left and right directions. As one of these switches is closed, by movement of the joystick shaft, the cursor on the CRT will move in that direction at a rate preset in the CRT hardware. When the cursor reaches the desired location the user releases the joystick shaft, with the shaft returning to the center home position allowing the activated directional switch to open. The cursor remains in its new position until repositioned by means of the joystick or the CRT electronics. With some prior art joysticks it is possible to close two adjacent directional switches to cause the cursor to move diagonally across the face of the CRT. However, to achieve that diagonal motion of the cursor, the user must develop a sense of feel for the joystick.There is no positive, fool proof joystick mechanism to assure the diagonal movement when the user requires it it is a hit and miss operation at best. The control shafts of prior art joysticks, typically, are also either very bulky and stiff, or so small the user cannot effectively hold onto it and control it. It would be desirable to have a joystick type control which would allow positive, fool proof control for graphic input, cursor control, crosshair control and scrolling for computer terminals or personal computers while being able to achieve that result without first developing a feel for the device before being able to move the cursor in any desired direction. The present invention disclosed herein represents such a control which can be substituted for prior art thumbwheels, joysticks, trackballs and cursor control keys. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the keyboard joyswitch of the present invention provides a switch plate defining a polygonal outline with a selected number of equilateral sides, and a multiplicity of directional switches adjacent alternate sides of the switch plate with the switch plate actuating at most two directional switches when pressure is applied to one side thereof. The invention further includes a base plate to which the switch plate is done so that it remains biased in a neutral position i.e. no switches activated so that only a single side of the switch plate may be depressed at any one time to achieve a positive, fool proof selection of the direction vector along which the selected indicia on theCRT screen may be moved.In most current applications the switch plate will be octagonal and there will be four directional switches to provide eight direction vectors the four vectors assigned to the individual switches and the geometric sum of the vectors assigned to adjacent switches along which the selected indicia may be moved on the CRT screen. Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a top view of the keyboard joyswitch of the present invention. Figure 2 is a side view of the keyboard joyswitch of Figure 1. Description of the Preferred Embodiment In Figures 1 and 2 there is shown a keyboard joyswitch 1 of the present invention. The joyswitch 1 includes an octagonal switch plate 3 mounted on a printed circuit board 5. The switch plate 3 has five shafts molded to its underside, four switch closure shafts 17 and a central mounting shaft 7. Switch plate 3 mounts to the printed circuit board 5 with shaft 7 extended through the printed circuit board 5. Spring 8 is retained on shaft 7 by retaining ring 10 and is partially compressed between ring 10 and board 5 to bias switch plate 3 in the neutral position. The four switch closure shafts 17 are molded adjacent the center of alternating edges of switch plate 3 and are disposed adjacent directional switches 9, 11, 13 and 15 on printed circuit board 5. Switch Plate 3 Switches Cursor MovementEdge Depressed Closed Direction 19 9 Up 21 9, 11 450 Up to Right 23 11 Right 25 11, 13 450 Down to Right 27 13 Down 29 13, 15 450 Down to Left 31 15 Left 33 15, 9 450 Up to Left TABLE 1 Switches 9, 11, 13 and 15 for this implementation can be a membrane or oil can type switch which is activated by lateral motion from above. As the user depresses edge 19 of switch plate 3, shaft 17 on that edge makes contact with and closes switch 9. If edge 21 is depressed, then both switches 9 and 11 are closed. If switches 9, 11, 13 and 15 are designated to control the up, right, down and left motion of the cursor, respectively, the switch closures and cursor direction for the depression of the eight different edges of switch plate 3 are as indicated in Table 1. The octagonal shape of switch plate 3 provides a positive fool proof means for selecting the direction of cursor movement. The shape of switch plate 3 and the method of mounting same make it impossible to depress more than one edge at a time, thus eliminating the necessity of getting a feel of the controller to be able to repeatedly select the desired direction. The smooth surface of switch plate 3 eliminates another problem that develops from long usage of a standard joystick hand cramps from grasping the stick. With the joyswitch 1 of the present invention the user can control switch plate 3 in many different ways with the tips of one or more fingers and they may be alternated during use to minimize the possibility of hand cramps. The foregoing description is of a joyswitch device for positively controlling cursor movement in eight directions using only four swtiches. It should be apparent to one skilled in the art that this idea can be extended to provide additional control directions through the use of other polygonal shapes of the switch plate i.e., five switches and ten sides for ten directions, six switches and twelve sides for twelve directions .
