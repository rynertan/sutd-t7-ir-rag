# An apparatus for and a method of testing detonating systems.

## Abstract
An apparatus for and a method of testing AC operable detonating modules 10 whereby an electric charge is discharged through a primary wire 20 threaded through or around a transformer core 14 of a module being tested and the voltage across, or the current through the primary wire is determined. Modules can be simply and reliably tested by means of a compact apparatus requiring a current of only about 1.4 mA.
