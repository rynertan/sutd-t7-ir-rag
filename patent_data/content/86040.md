# Mineral cutting tool.

## Abstract
Mineral mining apparatus comprising a pick head 1 mounted on a pick holder 4 for displacement of a cutting part 5 in the direction of arrow A has a nozzle 9 in the head 1 through which nozzle water is sprayed for dust suppression, cooling or flushing purposes. The characteristics of the nozzle 9 provide the spray 22 with a flat configuration where the width y of the spray is greater than its depth x. Preferably the width y lies in the cutting plane 20 of the cutting part and the spray follows the cutting part to alleviate incendive sparking. In a modification the nozzle 9 can be mounted on the holder 4.
