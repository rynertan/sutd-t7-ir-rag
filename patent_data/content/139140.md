## Description
PROCESS FOR THE FORMATION OF PHOSPHONOMETHYLATED AMINO ACIDSBackground of the Invention Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of phosphonomethylated amino acids. Description of the Prior Art Various processes have been described for the preparation of phosphonomethylated amino acids. For example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,799,758 and 3,977,860 to J. E.Franz it is suggested that N phosphonomethyl glycine a known herbicidal compound be prepared by reacting the amino acid glycine with chloromethylphosphonic acid. Rather than using glycine and chloromethylphosphonic acid as starting materials to synthesize such compounds, however, some more recent patents e.g., U.S.Patent Nos. 3,923,877 and 4,008,296 to J. E. D. Barton have rejected the approach described by the abovementioned Franz patents and have suggested synthesizingN phosphonomethylglycine from differing and, allegedly, cheaper starting materials, i.e., sodium cyanide, ammonium chloride, and formaldehyde, by using them to make 1,3,5 tricyanomethylhexahydro 1,3,5 triazine, followed by its reaction with an ester of phosphorus acid to form an ester of N phosphonomethylglycinonitrile and its subsequent hydrolysis to form the desired product. Although the Barton patents indicate that the Franz approach required the prior preparation of chloromethylphosphonic acid, neither they nor theFranz patents further discuss or suggest means for doing so.Summary of the Present Invention In its broadest embodiment, the present invention involves the reaction of a dihalide of halomethyl phosphonic acid with water to form the corresponding halomethylphosphonic acid and the subsequent reaction of the desired amino acid with such phosphonic acid to form the desired end product. The present process, in a particularly preferred embodiment, involves the preparation of phosphonomethylated amino acids by a reacting a phosphorus trihalide and formaldehyde to form the dihalide of halomethylphosphonic acid b reacting the product from step a with water, as described above1 to form halomethylphosphonic acid and c reaction of the desired amino acid with the halomethylphosphonic acid to yield the N phosphonomethylated amino acid of choice.Detailed Description of theProcess of the Present Invention The first step in the instant process, in a preferred embodiment, is the reaction of a suitable phosphorus trihalide, preferably phosphorus trichloride, with formaldehyde to form the dihalide of halomethylphosphonic acid which has the formula XCH2P O X2, where X can be chlorine or bromine, preferably chlorine.This reaction is known and is described in various prior art references, including U.S. Patent No. 2,874,184 toJ. L. Van Winkle et al. Chemical Abstracts, Vols. 45 and 48, 10191b 1951 and 564 b 1954 , respectively, and J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 75, 5738 5740 1953 . In general, the reaction can be conducted at temperatures of 1600C. 3000C. using at least 1.5 moles of phosphorus trihalide per mole of formaldehyde. Preferably, the reaction is carried out under pressure e.g., up to about 920 psig using a suitable autoclave, e.g., one constructed of nickel to prevent potential corrosion problems from developing.If desired, a small amount of chlorine gas can be added towards the end of the reaction to reoxidize any undesired lower oxidation state phosphorus compounds formed by disproportionation reaction mechanisms from the desired P 0 species. The dihalide of halomethylphosphonic acid, most preferably obtained by the initial step described above, is then reacted with water to form the corresponding halomethylphosphonic acid of the formula XCH2P O OH2 , where X is as defined above. This reaction can be accomplished, for example, by adding the reaction mixture resulting from the first step slowly to a sufficient amount of water to react with the dihalide product contained therein. This reaction can be conducted at temperatures from about OOC. to about 1000C. The amount of water is preferably from about 5 30 times the theoretical amount needed. Further details of this process is contained in U.S. Patent No. 2,874,184 toJ. L. Van Winkle et al.If desired, a strong acid, e.g., HC1, can be present in the water to suppress formation of phosphorus compounds having undesired phosphorus oxidation states. The remaining portions of the instant process are generally known from the aforementioned Franz patents and involve reaction of the halomethylphosphonic acid with the amino acid of choice having the formulaHO2CRNH2, where R is an unsubstituted or substituted alkylene moiety containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms in its backbone. Representative substituents for R include alkyl C1 C6 alkyl , aryl, arylalkyl and nitrogen heterocycles e.g., derived from pyrrole, indole, imidazole, purine, pyridine, etc. A preferred amino acid and halomethylphosphoric acid can be improved in various ways.One way is to conduct the reaction under alkaline conditions e.g., a pH of 9.5 10.5 with the phosphonic acid being gradually added to the amino acid, e.g., at the rate of 0.1 to 0.5 mole of phosphonic acid reactant per mole of amino acid reactant per hour.Both are in the form of their alkali metal salts in this preferred mode of reaction. Another way is to conduct the reaction at the above alkaline conditions in the presence of a water soluble polyamine catalyst having a sufficient concentration of amine nitrogen atoms to promote the reaction. One suitable polyamine catalyst is sold under the trademark PURIFLOC C 31 brand by Dow Chemical Company. The following Examples illustrate certain embodiments of the present invention. EXAMPLE 1 A corrosion resistant six gallon autoclave was used to manufacture the chloride of chloromethylphosphonic acid. Flaked paraformaldehyde 2.27 kg., 91 purity was charged into the vessel, and it was then sealed. While cooling the vessel, two 5.45 kg. portions of phosphorus trichloride were pressurized into the vessel with 13.6 atm. of nitrogen. The temperature varied between 1500 and 2000C. and the pressure varied between 6.8 and 13.6 atm. after addition of the first portion. The second portion was added after the pressure had peaked. The reactor was then heated to 2650C. and kept there for 2.5 hours. The reactor contents were then transferred to a holding tank. Material was accumulated from the prior procedure.Into a glass lined reactor with condenser and receiver, 45.4 kg. of the crude product was charged. Cooling was applied to the reactor. A total of 1.36 kg. of chlorine was added at a rate of 2.27 kg. If the temperature exceeded 35 40 C., the rate of chlorine addition was slowed. After completion of the chlorine addition, the temperature was raised to 700C. while the pressure was lowered to 100 mm Hg. Distilled impurities, including POC13, were collected. More impurities were then distilled by lowering the pressure to 10 mm Hg. The intended product was collected when the vapor and liquid temperature difference was 150C. The product distilled at about 820C. EXAMPLE 2 Five hundred milliliters of an aqueous solution containing about 35 hydrogen chloride with the remainder being water was added to a 1000 ml. round bottom, three neck flask equipped with a condenser, magnetic stirrer, pot thermometer, addition funnel and outlet to a sodium hydroxide trap. The flask was heated to 700C. and then 84 gm. 0.5 mole of chloromethylphosphonic dichloride, from Example 1, was added over a period of 20 minutes.Heating was continued for two hours, and the mixture was stirred without heating overnight. The next day, the mixture was heated at 700C., for two additional hours and was then allowed to cool to 350C. The mixture was rotary concentrated to a solid lavender crystals .The product had a melting point of 840 860C. and weighed 65 gm. The following analytical results confirmed the presence of the desired product, ClCH2P O OH 2 1H NMR 3.65 ppm d and37P NMR 16.4 singlet Ref. Voh Wagner 17.8 No starting material was detected. Into the s mtp e of equipment used prevIous lyX was placed 65.0 gm. 0.5 mole of the previously prepared chloromethyl phosphonic acid, 37.5 gm. 0.5 mole of glycine, and 200 ml. of water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 10 by the addition of 50 sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution. This caused the solution to heat up to 650C., and the solution was then further heated to 980C. over 1.5 hours. The reaction solution was heated intermittently for a total of twentytwo hours at 980 1040C. over the next seven days.When necessary, the pH was adjusted to 10 by the addition of 50 sodium hydroxide. A total of 88 ml.of 50 sodium hydroxide was used. While cooling the reaction solution, ninety five milliliters of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to it. The reaction mixture was then evaporated to dryness with the aid of a hot water bath and water aspirator vacuum. The crystalline product was digested for two hours at room temperature with 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The grainy solid was then filtered away from the product solution. Liquid was removed from the solution with the aid of a hot water bath and water aspirator vacuum to give a gummy solid weighing 87.2 gm. The solid was precipitated from water by adding ethanol and heating. The mixture was then cooled, and the product was removed by filtration and washed with ethanol.The product was dried in a vacuum dessicator and weighed 27.0 gm. which was 31 of the theoretical yield. Proton and 31H nmr 3.35 ppm doublet and 4.1 ppm singlet 31P nmr 87 ppm. Mass spectrum confirmed the phosphonomethylglycine structure plus a bis phosphonomethyl glycine impurity. Titration and ir also supported phosphonomethylglycine formation and ion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography of the product versus authentic phosphonomethylglycine proved its preparation. EXAMPLE 3 The same type of apparatus used in Example 2 was employed in this Example. Five hundred milliliters of concentrated hydrochloric acid 37.5 HC1 was heated to 700C. To the heated acid was then added in a dropwise manner 84 gm. 0.5 mole of chloromethyl phosphonic dichloride. The addition was completed in about 20 minutes and a temperature of 75 850C. was maintained for one additional hour. The resulting mixture was cooled and left under nitrogen gas overnight. Heating was resumed the next day at 800C. 850C. for about three hours. The mixture was cooled to 400C. and then rotary concentrated with a hot water bath to a crystalline solid. The solid was removed from the flask and air dried. It had a weight of 65.25 gm. Into the same type of apparatus used in Example 2 was placed 24 gm. 15.7 ml. or 0.3 mole of a 50 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide which was warmed to about 500C. Glycine 7.5 gm or 0.1 mole was added to this solution. The chloromethylphosphonic acid 13.05 gm or 0.1 mole was added, and the heat of neutralization caused the temperature to rise to 1100C. Heating was suspended, and the solution was stirred. The contents of the flask were cooled to 900C. and heating was resumed in order to hold the temperature at 90 1100 C. The pH of the solution was maintained at 10 11 by addition of 50 sodium hydroxide. Reaction time was a total of twenty hours over a period of three days. The contents of the flask were concentrated to a viscous semi solid having a weight of 41 5 gm, The semi solid was acidified with hydrochloric acid and then concentrated in vacuo with the aid of a hot water bath. The resultant white solid was slurried in 150 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Insoluble sodium chloride was filtered off and air dried to yield a solid having a weight of 33.4 gm. The filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator to a viscous oil of clear, amber color having a weight of 18.6 gm. Crystallization of this material from 80 90 ethanol failed.A small amount 1.5 gm. of compound was recrystallized from acetone water. The acetone water supernatant solution was concentrated to yield 8,5 gm. of solid product. Ion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography confirmed the presence of the desired product in both precipitate and concentrate. EXAMPLE 4 Into a 250 ml. round bottom flask equipped as inExample 2 was placed 7.5 gm. 0.1 mole of glycine and 13.5 gm. 0.1 mole of the chloromethylphosphonic acid which was prepared in the first part of Example 3. A 50 sodium hydroxide solution 24 gm. or 0.3 mole 15.7 ml. was added slowly with stirring. The heat of neutralization caused a temperature rise to 650C. Heating to 900C. was then begun, and the temperature was maintained with stirring for about 14.5 hours. The pH was maintained at 9 10 by additions of 50 sodium hydroxide. The reaction was carried out over several days. The reaction mixture was chilled in an ice bath, and acidified with up to 25 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid so that the pH fell to about 1 2. The resulting liquid composition was concentrated to a solid in vacuo with hot water heat. The resultant solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 800C. for three hours. It had a weight of about 40.4 gm. It analyzed as 13.7 phosphonomethyl glycine by ion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography. This corresponds to 33 of the theoretical yield.
