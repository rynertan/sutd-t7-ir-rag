A bracket 9 which can be freely attached to and detached from a frame 2 is affixed to each discrete chute member and each chute member is provided near its lower end with a pin 7 , for engaging a hole formed in the upper edge of the lower chute. Such an arrangement can facilitate access to the inside of the chute, for example for cleaning.
