## Description
The present invention relates to a method for removal and or prevention of formation of salt deposits in critical sections of a process plant, in which nitrogen oxides containing gas is transported, cooled, and possibly dried by removal of condensate and compressed. In the gas of such a plant it might be maintained a water vapour pressure which lies above the critical vapour pressure at the existing temperature for the salt deposits. For catalytic combustion of ammonia to nitrogen oxides, it has been found that there will always be a certain penetration of uncombusted ammonia which proceeds in the process together with the nitrous gas. Especially during start up of the combustion furnaces the penetration of ammonia may be substantial. Ammonium salts will be formed during cooling of the gas, especially ammonium nitrate, which might crystallize and form deposits in the apparatus. However, the formed salts are hygroscopic and easily soluble in water. When the relative humidity of the gases is higher than the critical humidity of ammonium nitrate, the ammonium nitrate will be present in form of a solution and will not crystallize and form deposits. The gases from the combustion unit are cooled before compression. When ammonia is combusted, water vapor is formed and removed from the gas as condensed water vapour during the latter part of the cooling step. The cooling is usually carried out by indirect cooling against cold surfaces such that the gas from the cooler has a dew point which is somewhat lower than the temperature of the gas. Accordingly, the gas will be reheated a few degrees because of the oxidation of NO to NO₂, between the outlet of the coolers and the compressor, according to equation The problems which are caused due to the formation of salt deposits in the above mentioned plants have been known for a long time. The salt deposits can lead to reduced production capacity, increased energy consumption and safety risks. The rotors of the compressor have been found to be exposed to salt deposits which have led to unbalance and breakage of the rotor blades or other compressor damages. It has been common practice to inject water into the nitrogen oxide containing gas in order to remove salt deposits. The compressors are equipped with several nozzles for intermittent water injection during operation. The interval between each washing might be varied from 4 36 hours and the washing time can be varied between 10 30 minutes. Normal addition of water during the washing step is in the range 0,015 0,04 kg Nm³ nitrogen oxide gas. Some nitrogen oxide gas compressors have also continuous water injection in the gas in addition to the discontinuous washing. Usually water is also supplied continuously to the sealing system of the compressor in order to prevent salt deposits. This addition also ends up in the product either by evaporation into the nitrogen oxide gas or by drainage as condensate. Thus there are substantial amounts of water which are necessary to avoid salt deposits. Such addition of wash water into the nitrogen oxide gas or condensate is however strongly unwanted as the water must be compressed and because of the resulting corresponding reduction of the process water to the absorption system. This will also reduce the absorption effectivity or the maximum obtainable product concentration. Washing with water will often not give the required cleaning for retaining maximum capacity in spite of the lengthy injection of water into the compressor. The reason for this is that the injected water droplets will not moisten all the surfaces where salt deposits are present because of their inertia. In some compressors the accumulation on these surfaces will be so large that periodic water injections during reduction of the speed of the compressor are necessary in order to obtain maximum capacity. Injected water droplets can also give substantial erosion in the compressor, especially on the rotor blades in axial compressors and around the pin holes in centrifugal compressors. It is further known a method for removal of such salt deposits by supplying water vapour in such amounts that there is established a water vapour pressure which lies above the saturation pressure of the salt deposits at the existing temperatures to the nitrogen oxide containing gas which has been dried during the cooling step. This method is described in the applicant s Norwegian patent No. 144 355 US patent No. 4,295,895 . However, it has been found that even though the method according to this patent is efficient, for certain types of plants increased investments and operation expenses are required. Especially in older plants in which cheap steam is not available, this method might be less attractive from an economic point of view. The object of the present invention was to arrive at a simplified, but at the same time effective method for preventing and or removing salt deposits in plants where nitrogen oxide containing gases occurred. A special object was to arrive at a method which could be used on existing plants without having to make any substantial investments in new equipment and or any substantial operational changes. Attempts to improve or simplify the above mentioned water washing methods, soon proved not to give the required efficiency. From the knowledge of the physical conditions which have to be present in order to avoid formation of deposits, one started out by studying the possibility to arrive at a unit and a method which could be operated within such conditions without having to inject water vapour into the process gas. Also the present method is based on the knowledge that ammonium nitrate can not exist in a stable solid form when it is in contact with gas having a water vapour partial pressure higher than the critical humidity of ammonium nitrate or when the temperature is above the sublimation point. By a representative example for cooling, transference and comprimation of nitrogen oxide containing gas in a conventional nitric acid plant, the relation between temperature and water vapour pressure can be as shown on figure 2. Diagram 1 shows the stability range for ammonium nitrate and diagram 2 shows the water vapour partial pressure. The figure shows that formation of deposits is possible in the apparatus at the conditions which exist after the gas cooler about 30 By consciously securing that the nitrogen oxide containing gas gets a sufficient water vapour partial pressure, these basic physical data are used for carrying out the method for preventing the existence of salt deposits. The gas which comes from the combustion unit has a sufficient water vapour content if it is not reduced below the critical humidity of the ammonium nitrate during the cooling step. The question was then how to maintain the necessary water vapour pressure in the nitrogen oxide containing gas, after cooling and further when it is conveyed into the compressor. It was found that this could be obtained in a surprisingly simple way by utilizing the heat content and the moisture content of the gas in a new way. Without supply of extra vapour or other forms of energy, one obtained a water vapour pressure in the gas after the cooling section and in the compressor which was above the critical humidity of the salt deposit at the existing temperature. A normal course within the method according to the invention is shown by means of diagram 3 in figure 2. The cooling section can practically be changed in several ways which will give the same end effect regarding water vapour pressure in the gas. The simplest way is to reduce the cooling of the gas such that the water vapour pressure will not be too low. This implies, however, the disadvantage that the gas volume into the compressor will be too large and thereby substantial reduction of the unit s capacity. The special features of the invention are that the prescribed vapour pressure which lies above the vapour pressure of the salt deposit at the existing temperature, is maintained by cooling part of the gas by direct injection of an amount of liquid which evaporates into the hot gas, and being sufficient to obtain the prescribed water vapour pressure. The invention is carried out by dividing the gas into several streams, cooling in two or several parallel coolers and that the gas in at least one of them is cooled by injection of water in liquid form directly into the gas. The rest of the gas is cooled by indirect cooling and the gas streams are mixed again before or in the unit where the salt deposits shall be removed or prevented. By direct cooling it is often most advantageous to use condensate from the indirectly cooled coolers. The invention will be further explained in the following examples and the text related to the figures. Figures 1 and 2 are described in the above text, and here it will just be referred to in connection with figures 3 and 4 and the examples. Figure 3 shows a conventional unit in which nitrogen oxide containing gas is conveyed in pipe 1 from an ammonia combustion unit not shown to a cooling section with three coolers A, B, C via separate pipes 2, 3, 4 . Subsequent to the cooling, the gas streams are joined in one pipe 5 having supply of air for oxidation via pipes 13 and further to the compressor 6 . To the compressor 6 and its inlet are means 12 for supply of water. To the coolers A, B, C is supplied water via pipe 7 for indirect cooling of the gas. The cooling water leaves the coolers through pipes 8 . Condensate from the coolers is drained via pipes 9 and transferred to a tank 10 for condensate. Some condensate can be recirculated via pipe 11 to the separate gas pipes 2, 3, 4 ahead of the coolers A, B, C . Figure 4 shows a process according to the invention when the function of the cooling section is changed relative to that shown in figure 3. By this operation of the invention, cooler A acts as a direct cooler as the gas here is only cooled with condensate via pipe 11 . The gas in the coolers B, C is cooled in the same way as shown in figure 3. Condensate can be returned to the separate gas pipes 3, 4 in the same way as in figure 3. This example is a comparative example and shows cooling of nitrogen oxide containing gases in a unit corresponding to that shown in figure 3. Gas having a temperature of about 160 The main part of that water vapour which is formed during the combustion of ammonia is condensed in the gas coolers. A condensate, 5 8 HNO₃ solution, is reinjected in the hot process gas in the gas coolers to improve absorption of unreacted ammonia from the combustion unit, and is again collected in condensate tank 10 . The condensate formed at any time is pumped out of the cooling system and supplied at a suitable place later on in the process. The cooled gas is mixed with secondary air 13 before it is conveyed to an axial compressor in which the pressure is increased from about 0,95 bar to about 5 bar. The water vapour partial pressure in the inlet pipe 5 and through the compressor is shown by diagram 2 in figure 2. Crystalline ammonium nitrate is stable up to about 170 One tried to remove the deposits by periodic water injection at the very inlet and to two later steps of the compressor 6 , but water washing did not give the desired result. The compressor did not regain the same capacity as when it was clean. Especially at the very inlet to the compressor there occurred accumulation of substantial amounts of crystalline ammonium nitrate. This example shows the operation according to the invention over an operation period in a unit as shown in figure 4. The method was used for periodic removal of ammonium nitrate deposits in the apparatus. The cooling water to the gas cooler A was closed, but the coolers B, C were run as during example 1. The gas through gas cooler A , which at the inlet had a temperature of about 160 The gas from cooler A had a temperature of about 70 By this method it is obtained two types of sub streams, that is the sub streams 3 and 4 which are cooled in the usual way by indirect cooling such that the water vapour pressure of the gas is lower than the equilibrium pressure and substream 2 which is only cooled by direct injection of liquid. The water vapour pressure of the gases will not be lower, on the contrary, it will increase because the sensible heat of the hot gases will be used for further increasing the water vapour pressure up to equilibrium. The gas streams are again mixed after the coolers, and it is formed a oversaturated gas in which part of the water vapour condenses in form of fog which follows the gas. The fog reevaporates during the further heating which takes place during the oxidation of NO to NO₂ and further on in compressor. The water vapour content in the gas during this cleaning procedure is shown by diagram 3 in figure 2. The water vapour pressure is higher than the equilibrium vapour pressure of the ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate will be transferred to a liquid phase and be transported out of the compressor and the supply pipe. The compressor regained full capacity and by inspection of the apparatus it was found that it was completely free of ammonium nitrate deposits. The experience from this unit showed that cleaning takes place very rapidly and that the whole procedure including closure of cooling water supply, temperature rise to equilibrium and again supply of cooling water for ordinary operation could be carried out appropriately in about 30 minutes. This example shows an operation according to the invention and in a unit as shown in figure 4, during start up of the combustion unit when the penetration of ammonia is especially large. Diluted nitric acid was injected into the gas ahead of the gas coolers A, B, C , and cooling water was supplied to coolers B, C while in the cooler A it was used direct cooling by injection of diluted nitric acid which might be earlier produced as a condensate from the tank 10 . As soon as the combustion unit was started and heated gas arrived at the gas coolers, it was as in example 2 formed an oversaturated gas stream by admixing the cold and the warmer saturated sub streams. The high moisture content of the gas streams 5 prevented formation of ammonium nitrate deposit even during the large ammonia penetration which takes place during start up. When the condition in the combustion unit was stabilized and continuous cleaning was not necessary, there was established normal operation by connecting supply of cooling water to the third cooler also. Removal of deposit was also carried out intermittently as described in example 2. In this way deposit of ammonium nitrate in the supply pipe and the compressor was effectively prevented. Contrary to the method here described, it has in several production units been usual to wash the compressor continuously with water during start up until stable conditions in the compression unit is obtained. This water washing will, however, not give a complete cleaning. As shown in the examples, removal of all of the ammonium nitrate deposits in the supply pipe and the nitrogen oxide gas compressor is obtained by the present invention without extra supply of water or vapour, by utilizing the water vapour content of the nitrogen oxide gas and the heat content from the combustion unit. Contrary to the water washing method, corresponding to that shown in figure 1, complete removal of the ammonium nitrate deposit is obtained by the present invention, and thereby it is secured compression of nitrogen oxide containing gas without the large consumption of water as the known methods require. Means for injecting water to the compressor and the gas pipe will also be unnecessary. Contrary to the method shown in the previously mentioned patent it is first of all obtained a simpler unit and secondly reduced steam consumption. By the present invention it is not needed any extra supply of energy. Also during start up of the combustion unit, when the deposit problems are largest, the present invention will prevent and remove formation of deposits without extra supply of steam in a period when the combustion unit itself has a deficit of steam, and a steam driven turbine compressor needs large supply of steam. Thus the steam system does not have to be dimensioned for supply of steam for removing deposit.
