## Description
NOVEL PHARMACEUTICAL USE FOR CGRPsThe present invention relates to a new use, in particular a new pharmaceutical use, for peptides comprising a CGRP peptide sequence, and analogues thereof.CGRP Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide is the term applied to a class of peptide produced by variant expression of calcitonin genes, e.g. in neural tissue or peripheral thyroid tissue.The calcitonins themselves constitute a class of pepti de hormone found to occur in a wide variety of chordate species. In mammals calcitonins are secreted from the thyroid gland and in non mammalian species from the ultimobranchial gland. Though of closely related structure, precise calcitonin peptide sequence has been found to vary to a greater or lesser degree from species to species and is generally species specific.Calcitonins inhibit bone resorption with consequential induction of hypocalcaemia, and various proposals have been made for the therapeutic application of both calcitonins of naturally occurring structure and artificial analogues thereof. Salmon calcitonin, human calcitonin, porcine calcitonin, bovine calcitonin and the eel calcitonin analogue Elcatonin are now commercially available and, salmon calcitonin in particular has found extensive and valuable clinical application. In maals calcitonin is produced by the thyroidal c cells.Recently the gene system for calcitonins has been the subject of intensive study. This has led to the elucidation of the human calcitonin structural gene published European patent applicationEP AI 0070675 and to the isolation of calcitonin precursor peptides and further peptide entities, such as katacalcin, derived from the flanking sequences of the human calcitonin precursor peptide published European patent application EP AI 0070186 .Still more recently a yet further class of peptide entity has been identified the so called calcitonin gene related peptides or CGRPs see e.g. Amara et al., Nature 298, 240 244 1982 Rosenfeld et al., Nature 304, 129 135 1983 Fischer et al.,Nature 305, 534 536 1983 concerning rat CGRP and Morris et al., Nature 308, 746 748 1984 MacIntyre et al., Neuropeptides 4, 425 484 1984 Brain et al., Nature 313, 54 56 1985 and MacIntyre et al., International PCT patent applica tion no. 87 00307. StructuraFly CGRPs represent an entirely new peptide class, with peptide sequences entirely distinct from those of the calcitonins. CGRPs have been found to be physiologically active and to exert a potent effect on mediator release, including release of neuro transmitters. Utility has been proposed for e.g. humanCGRP as a cardiovascular agent, in particular for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease e.g. for the prophylaxis or treatment of disturbances in peripheral circulation, e.g. in limbs, including intermittant claudication as well as for the treatment of coronary vessel disease e.g. for the prophylaxis or treatRient of coronary insufficiency .A further area of application indicated is in patient testing, e.g. in determining tone of the coronary arteries, e.g. in relation to application of other drug therapy or coronary surgery, e.g. coronary by pass therapy. See in particular International PCT patent application no.87 00307 referred to above .In accordance with the present invention it has now surprisingly been found that CGRPs, also exhibit valuable Ca2 regulating activity. Yet more suprisingly it has been found that, quite unlike the calcitonins they exhibit both hypo and hyper calcaemic effects, e.g. as hereinafter described. This entirely unexpected opposition of activities renders the CGRPs especially suited for application as regulators of body Ca2 metabolism, e.g. in the treatment of disease associated with or having an aetiology comprising body Ca2 imbalance, in particular in the treatment of hypercalcaemia including emergency treatment of hypercalcaemic crisis as well as prolonged treatment in chronic hypercalcaemic states , Paget s disease, and, especially, osteoporosis, including post menopausal osteoporosis, immobilization osteoporosis, for example subsequent to fracture, rapid osteoporosis due to nerve paralysis and steroid induced osteoporosis, as well as bone pain associated with osteoporosis or osteolysis, and pain consequential to metastatic bone deposits.The present invention accordingly provides i A method for the regulation of calcium, e.g. for the treatment of disease associated with or having an aetiology comprising body calcium imbalance, in particular for the treatment of specific conditions as set forth above, in a subject in need of such treatment, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a peptide comprising the peptide sequence of a CGRP or of an analogue thereof ii The use of a peptide comprising the peptide sequence of a CGRP or of an analogue thereof, for the regulation of calcium, e.g. for the treatment of disease associated with or having an aetiology comprising body calcium imbalance, in particular for the treatment of specific conditions as set forth above as well as iii The use of a peptide comprising the peptide sequence of aCGRP or of an analogue thereof, for the manufacture of a composition for use in the treatment of disease associated with or having an aetiology comprising body calcium imbalance, in particular for the treatment of specific conditions as set forth above By the term 1peptide comprising the peptide sequence of a CGRP1 as used herein is to be understood not only the CGRPs themselves but also precursors thereof, for example, the naturally occurringCGRP precursor peptides.By analogues of CGRPs are meant peptides derived from the structure of a CGRP, e.g. obtained by any of the means commonly employed in the art of peptide chemistry for the derivatisation or modification of naturally occurring peptide entities, for example by omission of one or more amino acid residues within the natural peptide sequence, or by replacement of one or more such residues by an alternative amino acid residue, by inversion of one or more peptide units with the natural peptide sequence, or by derivatisation of the C or N terminal.Preferred peptides for use in accordance with the present invention are rat CGRP and, in particular, human CGRP having the formula EMI5.1 wherein either A is Ser , B is Asn , C is Asp and D is Glu RAT CGRP orA is Ala , B is Asp , C is Asn and D is Lys HUMAN CGRP .The peptides for use in accordance with the present invention can be prepared in accordance with conventional techniques for peptide synthesis known in the art, including solid phase synthesis, as well as by genetic engineering, e.g. recombinant DNA, techniques. For use in accordance with the present invention the subject peptides may be employed in free or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt or complex form, for example in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts e.g. hydrochlorides, sulfonates, etc. or metal complexes, such salt and complex forms being well known in the art. Such salt and complex forms generally have the same level of activity and tolerability as the free peptides. All references to the subject peptides herein are to be understood as including both the free peptides as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and complexes as aforesaid.Furthermore the subject peptides can, in accordance with the method of the invention, also be employed alone, or in conjunction with other appropriate pharmaceutical agents, in particular agents capable of regulating calcium metabolism, and especially in conjunction with calcitonins, e.g. as hereinafter described.Utility of the subject peptides in accordance with the present invention may be demonstrated in animal test models as well as in clinical trials, e.g. performed as follows I. CONTINUOUS ON LINE MEASUREMENT OF FREE CALCIUM CONCENTRATIONS IN THE EXTRA CORPOREAL BLOOD CIRCULATION OF YOUNG RABBITS The general scheme for this test is rëpresented in figure 1 attached A flow through electrode system with two Ca2 selective liquid membrane electrodes is inserted in the arterio venous extracorporeal blood circulatory system of the test animal this being established by means of indwelling catheters connecting the femo ral artery with femoral vein. The blood is pumped from the artery to the vein at a flow rate of 18 ml h through the system containing Ca2 selective electrodes.A second peristaltic pump aspirates the reference solution of electrolytes, which is transported at a flow rate of 0.9 ml h, passing the compartment of the reference electrode and mixed with the circulating blood at the site of the common electrode. The mixed fluids are then returned into the ciculatory system of the animal.The Ca2 selective electrode allows the potentiometric measurement of the ionized calcium quantitatively. The potential difference between the reference electrode and the Ca2 selective electrode is measured differentially relative to the common electrode. The analogue signal of the difference amplifier is processed by a digital voltmeter. Results are obtained in mV and are continously recorded as a function of time. The voltage difference is proportional to the Ca2 concentration.Following administration of CGRPs i.v. to the test animal, a potent influence on Ca2 concentration over extended periods of time and up to at least 5 hours is observed at dosages of from about 0.l to about 25 ug kg. More importantly results observed indicate that CGRPs exert both a hypo and hyper calcaemic effect which is both dose and time dependent. Thus administration of rat CGRP at dosages of 5 pg kg or less induces a primarily hypocalcaemic response, while administration at dosages in excess of 5 iug kg induces a primarily hyper calcaemic response preceeded by a transient hypo calcaemic response at the lower end of the dosage range.Specific results obtained following lx administration of rat CGRP at varying dosages and illustrating activity profile are shown in the accompanying Figs.2 through 5. In all cases administration of test substance occurs at time . Fig.2 . This is a plot for observed change in calcium level t calcaemia with time, following i.v. admini stration of rat CGRP at dosages of from 0.156 uglkg to 5.0 ug kg. In all cases a decrease hypocal caemia is observed with a duration of from 1 to at least 3 hours. Evaluation of AUCS areas under curve obtained indicate that these are statistical ly linear.Figs3 to4 Plots for observed change in calcium level following i.v. administration of rat CGRP at dosages of 2.5 and 5.0 gug kg to groups of four test animals com pared with results obtained for untreated controls. In both cases hypocalcaemia is again observed with a duration of from 3 to 6 hours following administra tion of rat CGRP.Fig 5 A plot for observed change in calcium level follo wing administration of rat CGRP at a dosage of 10 pg kg i.v. compared with untreated control. At this dosage hypocalcaemic response analogous to that ob served at lower dosages Figs 1 to 3 , though strongly marked, is transitory only and is followed by a reverse hypercalcaemic response which continues very strongly for a period of up to at least 5 hours following initial administration.With further dosage increase hypercalcaemic response becomes in creasing dominant. Directly analogous results may be obtained employing other CGRPs and peptides incorporating a CGRP peptide sequence, in particular employing human CGRP. Thus accompanying Fig. 6 shows plots for observed change in calcium level following i.v. administration of human CGRP at a dosage of 2.5 zug kg to groups of 6 animals in the same test model as described above. As will be seen the course of response parallels that recorded for rat CGRP in Fig. 5.These results indicate that the subject peptides exert an influence not only on the uptake of calcium into body tissue, but also on liberation of free calcium, enabling further subsequent up take.II. CLINICAL TRIAL A The trial is carried out employing volunteer subjects male and female exhibiting active Paget s disease. Human CGRP is employed as trial substance and is tested by administration in accordance with the following regimens 1. Acute single dosage administration 1.1 i.v. injection of dosages of from 0.1 to 20 p9 e.g. lx 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10, or 20 p9 1.2 i.v. infusion over 6 hours of dosages of 10 to 100 pg e.g. lx 10, 15, 20, 25, 50 or 100 yg 1.3 s.c. injection of dosages of from 10 to 200 p9 e.g. lx 10, 20, 50, 100, 150 and 200 pug 1.4 intranasal administration of dosages of from 10 to 500 pg e.g. lx 10, 50, 100, 150, 250 and 500 ug 2. Semi chronic single dosage daily for 5 to 7 days administration 2.1 s.c. injection of dosages of from 10 200 p9 e.g. 10, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 p9 lx daily .The following parameters are measured prior and post administration circulating calcium serum levels alkaline phosphatase hydroxyproline bone specific protein levels.On administration of human CGRP in accordance at the above indicated dosages, significant reduction of circulating serum calcium levels is observed. Assay for alkaline phosphatase and hydroxyproline levels show a concomitant reduction and assay for bone specific proteins shows a marked reduction in particular of those proteins reflecting bone metabolic turn over. III. CLINICAL TRIAL B The methodology of clinical trial A is repeated, with administration of human CGRP in accordance with regimen 1.3. In this trial however administration is accompanied by administration of salmon or human calcitonin at dosages of from 5 to 100 I.U. or M.R.C , e.g. at dosages of 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 I.U. or M.R.C. administered by injection either s.c. or i.m.Influence on measured serum parameters is observed in this trial as in trial A, the effect in relation to reduction of circulating serum calcium levels is in particular superior to that observed on administration of salmon calcitonin alone at the indicated dosages. The subject peptides are accordingly useful for the treatment of disease associated with or having an aetiology comprising bodyCa2 imbalance, in particular for the treatment of specific conditions hereinbefore set forth and especially for the treatment of osteoporosis.For this use the dosage will of course vary depending on the particular peptide employed, the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated, the duration of treatment envisioned and the effect desired. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained on administration of, for example, human or rat CGRP, at a daily dosage of from about 0.001 to about 15.0, for example from about 0.05 to about 15.0 pg kg, e.g. from about 0.07 to about 7.0 pg kg, in particular from about 0.15 to about 3.0 pg kg animal body weight.For clinical use the total daily dosage is suitably in the range of from about 0.1 to about 500 p9, for example from about 5.0 to about 500 Irg, preferably from about 10 p9 to about 200 yg e.g. for administration i.v., s.c., i.m. or nasally, whereby higher dosages, e.g. of up to about 1,000 p9 may be employed, for example where intensive short term treatment or, in particular, nasal administration, is contemplated.As indicated above dosages will depend inter al. on the particular condition to be treated. Thus for the treatment of osteoporosis lower dosages e.g. at the lower end of the ranges indicated above will generally be appropriate as compared with dosages required e.g. for the treatment of Paget s disease or pain consequential to metastatic bone deposits.Administration may be effected by any of the routes commonly employed in the art in relation to administration of e.g. calci tonins, e.g. by injection or infusion i.v., by injection s.c. or i.m. or nasally, e.g. in the form of nasal drops or nasal spray.In general however i.v. administration will be less preferred.Administration may be efected e.g. Sx daily, in divided doses 2x to 4x daily or in sustained release form. Unit dosage forms for administration thus suitably comprise from about about 0.025 to about 250 pg, for example from 1.25 to about 250 yg, preferably from about 2.5 to about 100 yg for multiple daily dosaging, or up to about 500 pg, preferably about 200 pg for single daily dosaging, with higher unit dosages, e.g. of up to about 500 pg being possible, for example where intensive short term treatment nasal administration is contemplated.In accordance with the present invention the subject peptides, e.g. human and rat CGRP, may be administered alone or conjointly or concomitantly with other appropriate pharmaceutical agents, in particular with calcitonins, e.g. salmon, human, porcine or bovine calcitonin or the eel calcitonin analogue Elcatonin.Where conjoint or concomitant therapy with a calcitonin is required, daily dosages for the calcitonin will be of similar order, or slightly less than those employed for conventional calcitonin therapy, e.g. from about 5 to about 200 I.U. or M.R.C. per day, for example from about 5 to about 50, suitably from about 5 to about 25 I.U. or M.R.C. per day for the treatment of osteoporosis, or from about 25 to about 200, suitably from about 50 to about 100 I.U. or M.R.C. per day for the treatment of Paget s disease or pain consequential to metastatic bone deposits, administered lx or 2 4x daily. Preferred calcitonins for conjoint or concomitant use with the peptides of the invention are salmon and human calcitonin. Where administration with a calcitonin is to be practiced, the cacitonin may be administered either separately or together with the subject peptides, and if desired the subject peptides may be put up in combination with a calcitonin in the same galenical formulation. Where administration is to be effected 2 to 4x daily suitable amounts of calcitonin, e.g. salmon calcitonin, for inclusion in such combined dosage forms will be from about 1.25 to about 100 I.U. or M.R.C. unit dosage.Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the method of the invention may be prepared in accordance with standard galenical methods for the formulation of peptide preparations.Thus compositions for injection suitably comprise active ingredient, e.g. human or rat CGRP, in solution or suspension in an appropriate, e.g. aqueous, medium. Such compositions are appropriately put up, e.g. in ampoules for injection. EXAMPLE 1COMPOSITION CONTAINING HUMAN CGRP SUITABLE FOR INJECTION Ingredient Quantity ml 1. Human CGRP 20 yg 2.
