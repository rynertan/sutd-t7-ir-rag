# INTERFERONS WITH NOVEL CYSTEINE PATTERN

## Abstract
Human interferons are modified by providing novel cys teine substitutions and disulfide bonds. The amino acid se quence of a first interferon is combined with the cysteine and or disulfide pattern of a second interferon to give modified interferons with hybrid properties. DNA polymers encoding for the modified interferons are disclosed together with plasmids incorporating the DNa and the transformation of host cells with the plasmid. The modified interferons are expressed by the transformed host cells and can be formulated for phar maceutical use.
