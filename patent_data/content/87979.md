# A semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A static type semiconductor memory device having a three layer structure the gate electrode wiring lines being formed by a first conductive layer of, for example, polycrys talline silicon the word lines, the ground lines, and the power supply lines being formed by a second conductive layer of, for example, aluminum and the bit lines being formed by a third conductive layer of, for example, alumi num the bit lines extending in a column direction, and the ground lines extending in a row direction whereby an improved integration degree, an improved operating speed, an improved manufacturing yield, and a countermeasure for soft errors due to alpha particles are attained.
