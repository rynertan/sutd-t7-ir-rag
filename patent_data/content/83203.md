# Method for the regeneration of solid adsorbents used to remove undesired compounds from a hydrocarbon stream.

## Abstract
A solid absorbent such as a molecular sieve which has been used to remove undesired compounds, for example oxygen containing hydrocarbonaceous compounds such as ethers and alcohols, water or sulfur containing compounds, from a hydrocarbon stream, particularly a light liquid phase hydrocarbon stream such as a stream which is rich in Câ‚„ hydrocarbons, is regenerated by stripping the adsorbent with a low temperature hydrogen rich gas stream, which preferably has a temperature below about 200 F 93 C , and then gradually increasing the temperature of the gas stream to customary regeneration temperatures.
