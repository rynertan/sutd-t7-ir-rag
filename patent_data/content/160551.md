# A Polyethylene microporous membrane and a process for the production thereof.

## Abstract
A polyethylene microporous membrane having a thick ness of not more than 10µm, a breaking strength of at least 200 kg cm² and a porosity of at least 30 is produced by heating and dissolving polyethylene having a weight aver age molecular weight of at least 5 10⁵ in a solvent, forming a gel sheet from the resulting solution, subjecting the gel sheet to a solvent removal treatment to adjust the amount of the solvent in the gel sheet to 10 to 80 by weight, heating and stretching the sheet and then removing the residual solvent therefrom.
