# A method of forming a film of diacetylenic polymer.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of forming a continuous film on a substrate comprising the steps of coating said substrate with a solution of a diacetylenic prepolymer in a liquid phenylacetylene solvent and curing the film to polymerize the prepolymer, the phenylacetylene solvent being reacted into the polymer structure during the step of curing the film.
