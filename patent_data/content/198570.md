## Description
PROCESS FOR EABRICATING THIN WALLED TUBING This invention relates to a process for fabricating thin walled tubing such as nuclear fuel cladding, from a zirconium niobium alloy such that the alloys of the.resultant products have a particular microstructure which enables the material to resist corrosion in high temperature aqueous environments. Binary zirconium niobium Zr Nb alloys have been traditionally of interest to the nuclear industry because of their high strengths. It is this feature, in conjunction with reasonably good corrosion resistance, which ultimately led to the selection of the alloy of zirconium containing 2.5 per cent by weight niobium, as the standard pressure tube material for present generation CanadianDeuterium Uranium CANDU reactors. Although it was originally believed that the zirconium niobium alloys had inferior resistance to irradiation enhanced corrosion relative to existing alloys, such as Zircaloy 2 orZircaloy 4, it ultimately became apparent that they actually had superior in pile corrosion properties when properly heat treated, as described by J. E. LeSurf, ASTM STP 458, p. 286.As a result of this finding, there has been increasing interest in zirconium niobium alloys as potential fuel cladding materials in future generation, high performance, light water reactors. At present, there is one major drawback which could prevent successful employment of zirconium niobium alloys as fuel cladding materials. This problem stems from the fact that superior corrosion resistance has been obtained only after application of the following multi step processing sequence 1 anneal at 850 9500C and water quench 2 cold work to 10 to 30 per cent reduction optional and 3 anneal for approximately 24 hours at approximately 500 OC. This processing is easily applied to the thick walled pressure tubes for which it was developed, but cannot be applied to commercially produced thin walled tubing with its inherently tight dimensional specifications and long lengths 4 m , which causes problems relative to maintaining the shape of the tubing.It is thus necessary that an alternate processing system be adopted for the production of thin walled tubing from zirconium niobium alloys, for use as fuel cladding. Also, any such processing system must yield superior corrosion resistance and at the same time, be consistent with practices employed in the commercial production of fuel cladding. We have found that zirconium niobium alloys can be fabricated into thin walled tubing, of about 0.040 inch or less in wall thickness, which exhibits excellent corrosion resistance, by a process that does not require extensively long final annealing times, by the use of relatively low temperature anneals between cold working steps and a final low temperature anneal. By using the processing techniques of the present invention, thin walled tubing can be fabricated that has a microstructure where second phase beta niobium particles are homogeneously dispersed in the zirconium matrix in extremely fine particle size to provide excellent corrosion resistance of the resultant article under both in pile and out of pile conditions. Accordingly, the present invention resides in a process for fabricating thin walled tubing from a zirconium niobium alloy containing from 1 to 2.5 per cent by weight niobium as homogeneously dispersed finely divided particles characterized by beta treating a zirconiumniobium alloy billet containing from 1 to 2.5 per cent by weight niobium extruding said beta treated billet at a temperature no higher than 6500C to form a tube shell further deforming said tube shell by cold working the same in a plurality of cold working stages annealing said tube shell, between each of said stages of cold working, at a temperature below 6500C and final annealing the resultant tubing at a temperature below 6000C, so as to produce a microstructure of the material having niobium particles of a size below about 800 angstroms homogeneously dispersed therein. The fabrication of thin walled tubing from a zirconium niobium alloy is effected according to the present invention with the production of tubing exhibiting excellent corrosion resistance and resistance to hydride formation. Especially useful are zirconium alloys containing 1.0 per cent by weight and 2.5 per cent by weight niobium.The zirconium niobium alloys may contain a minor amount, up to 0.5 per cent by weight of a third element, such as copper, iron, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, vanadium and chromium. An example of such an alloy is one containing zirconium with 2.5 per cent niobium and 0.5 per cent copper. In one embodiment of the invention, the alloys are first subjected to a beta treatment by heating the alloy to from 950 10000C and water quenching the same to a temperature below the alpha beta to alpha transus temperature. The billet is then prepared for extrusion by drilling an axial hole along the center line of the billet, machining the outside diameter to desired dimensions, and applying a lubricant to the surfaces of the billet. The billet diameter is then reduced by extrusion at a lower than conventional temperature, below 7000C, through a frustoconical die and over a mandrel. A beta anneal of the extruded tube shell may then be effected, depending upon the alloy, by heating to from 850 10500C, followed by rapid cooling. The billet may then be cold worked by pilgering, at a source of primary fabrication, to reduce the wall thickness and outside diameter.This intermediate production is called a TREX Tube Reduced Extrusion , which may then be sent to a tube mill for fabrication by cold working, intermediate low temperature annealing, and a final anneal under the fabricating steps of the present invention to produce the desired thin walled tubing. In the formation of the thin walled tubing, the material is preferably cold worked by pilgering, and 3 to 5 stages of cold working effected, preferably 3 to 4 stages. The present invention produces thin walled zirconium alloy tubing wherein the alloying elements are homogeneously dispersed throughout the zirconium in a finely divided state. The particles, homogeneously dispersed, are of an average particle size below 800 angstroms, and preferably the average particle size is below about 500 angstroms. In order that the invention can be more clearly understood, convenient embodiments thereof will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a flow diagram of a process for fabricating thin walled tubing Figure 2 is a graph illustrating the superior corrosion resistance of the zirconium niobium alloy containing I per cent niobium processed according to the flow diagram of Figure 1, as compared with reported corrosion resistance of such an alloy Figures 3A, B, C and D show transmission electron microscopy photomicrographs illustrating the typical precipitate distribution and size observed in a fully annealed tubing formed from a zirconium alloy containing 1.0 per cent by weight niobium and produced according to the flow diagram of Figure 1 Figures 4A, B, C and D show transmission electron microscopy photomicrographs illustrating the typical precipitate distribution and size observed in a fully annealed tubing formed from a zirconium alloy containing 2.5 per cent by weight niobium and produced according to the flow diagram of Figure 1 and Figures 5A, B, C and D show transmission electron microscopy photomicrographs illustrating the typical precipitate distribution and size observed in a fully annealed tubing formed from a zirconium alloy containing 2.5 per cent by weight niobium and 0.5 per cent by weight copper and produced according to the flow diagram of Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1, a niobium containing zirconium alloy A ingot, containing 1.0 per cent by weight niobium and the balance zirconium, was conventionally broken down in billets of about six inches in diameter Step 1 . A six inch diameter billet was then given a beta treatment, Step 2, which comprised holding the billet in a furnace at about 968 9960C 1775 18250F for about fifteen minutes and then water quenching the billet. At this point, the beta treated billet was machined, bore holed and inspected in preparation for extrusion. The hollow niobium containing zirconium alloy billet was then heated to about 6490C 12000F and extruded Step 3 to a hollow tube having an outside diameter of 2.5 inches and a wall thickness of 0.43 inch. The extruded hollow tube was beta annealed Step 4 at 9540C 17500F for a period of fifteen minutes in preparation for a first cold working step a pilgering reduction , Step 5 . The beta annealed extrusion was pilgered in Step 5 to a TREX having an outside diameter of 1.75 inches and a wall thickness of 0.3 inch. The TREX was then annealed, Step 6 , at 5000C 9320F for a period of 8 hours. Following the annealing of the TREX, the same was then cold pilgered to a tube shell having an outside diameter of 1.25 inches and a wall thickness of 0.16 inch, Step 7 . The tube shell was then further annealed and cold worked according to the following sequence.The tube shell was annealed, Step 8 , at about 5240C 9750F for 7.5 hours and further cold pilgered, Step 9 , to reduce the tube shell to one having an outside diameter of 0.875 inch and a wall thickness of 0.085 inch. This tube shell was again annealed at about 5240C 9750F for 7.5 hours1 Step 10 . The annealed tube shell was again further cold pilgered, Step 11 , to give a tube shell having an outside diameter of 0.602 inch and a wall thickness of 0.045 inch.A further cold working anneal, Step 12 , was effected at about 52 4 OC 9750F for 7.5 hours and the tube shell finally cold pilgered, Step 13 , to give a tube having an outside diameter of 0.423 inch and a wall thickness of 0.025 inch. The tube was then subjected to a final anneal at about 4270C 8000F for 4 hours, Step 14 . A second niobium containing alloy B ingot, containing 2.5 per cent by weight niobium and the balance zirconium, was treated according to the present process, the B composition ingot treated as was A, except for the following variations. An examination of the TREX indicated that the B composition had not received the correct betaanneal and was, prior to Step 7, given a further, extra annealing at 5800C 10760F for a period of 8 hours. Also, the cold working anneal for the tubes formed from composition B were effected at about 5800C 10760F for 8 hours rather than 5240C 9750F for 7.5 hours as with A . The remaining treatment steps, including the final anneal were the same as those used with composition A. A third niobium containing alloy C ingot, containing 2.5 per cent by weight niobium, 0.5 per cent by weight copper, and the balance zirconium, was treated according to the present invention, the C composition ingot treated as was composition A through Step 5. The TREX was then annealed in Step 6 at 6000C 11120F for a period of 8 hours. When the cold working of Step 7 was attempted, transverse cracks appeared. The material was therefore subjected to an additional anneal for 3 hours at about 685 OC 12650F and the material then subjected to Step 7 with successful pilgering. Also, the first cold working anneal, Step 8, was carried out at about 5930C 11000F for a period of 8 hours. Subsequent cold working anneals were effected at about 5800C 10760F , as with composition B.After the final cold work step, Step 13, the tube was subjected to a final anneal, Step 14, for 7.5 hours at about 4800C 8960F . Stress relieved sections of tubing of compositions A, B and C, processed as described above, were corrosion tested in a static autoclave in 4270C, 10.3MPa steam and 3600C, 18.7MPa water and compared with results of such corrosion testing of Zircaloy 4. The results of the corrosion tests are listed in Table I and demonstrate that zirconium niobium alloys processed according to the present invention have corrosion resistance superior to that of Zircaloy 4.

E.LeSurf in The Corrosion Behavior of 2.5 Nb Zirconium Alloy ,Applications Related Phenomenon for Zirconium and ItsAlloys, ASTM STP 458, American Society for Testing andMaterials, 1969, pp. 286 300.

Two experimental Zr Nb alloys were exposed in the BR 3 pressurized water reactor located in Mol, Belgium, for about seven and one half months at power .Five high power fuel rods were removed and sectioned at five elevations one section at the peak power location two sections at 90 power1 above and below the peak power location and two sections at 50 power near the ends. The minimum, maximum, and mean oxide thicknesses from those five sections are listed in Table III, in comparison with Zircaloy 4 TABLE III Oxide Film Thicknesses Measured on Fuel Rods After BR 3 Cycle 3B Irradiation Test Alloy Minimum yam Maximum Mm Mean llm Zr 1 Nb A 1.962 3.875 3.011 Zr 2.5 Nb B 2.210 3.022 2.669 Zircaloy 4 2.633 4.234 3.658These examinations indicate that niobium containing zirconium alloy tubes of the present invention have in pile corrosion resistance superior to that of Zircaloy 4.This is a property which, in the past, has been attributed only to heat treated 2.5 Nb zirconium alloys see The Effect of Aging and Irradiation on the Corrosion of Zr 2.5 wt Nb , V. F. Urbanic, J. E. LeSurf and A. B. Johnson, Jr. Corrosion 31 1975 15 . Further evidence of the superiority of the tubing prepared according to the present invention is illustrated in Figure 2 where two groups of corrosion data are presented for a zirconium alloy containing 1 per cent by weight niobium. The first group of data dash lines 350, 400 and 4500C were reported for sheet material which was fabricated via standard Russian processing techniques see A. A.Kiselev, et al., AECL 1724, 1963 . The second group of data solid lines 360 and 4270C were obtained from tubing processed according to the present invention. The superiority of the present tubing is demonstrated by the fact that the same exhibits lower weight gains at 360 and 4270C than the Russion material does, even though the latter was exposed at lower corrosion temperatures 350 and 4000C respectively. The present processing provides uniform distribution of very fine precipitate particles in the microstructure of niobium containing zirconium alloys. The microstructure of the fully annealed tubing is illustrated in Figures 3A, B, C and D for composition A 4A, B, C andD for composition B and 5A, B, C and D for composition C . Because of the fine particle sizes obtained, transmission electron micrographs TEM were taken. In deformed materials, diffraction effects from gain boundaries and dislocations interfere with particle resolution. Therefore, then study of particle dispersions was carried out on fully annealed, final tubing. The final annealing cycle for A was 8 hours at 5000C 932 F , and for B and C was 8 hours at 6000C 11120F . Results of the chracterization of the particle distribution in the annealed material are given in Table IV as follows TABLE IV Data on Particle Size Distributions In Annealed Product Tubing Average Diameter Alloy Angstroms Number Density cjn3 A 230 11 x 1014 B 420 12 x 1014 14 C 450 8 x 10 The observed precipitate sizes and number densities represent relatively fine dispersions. This is evident when comparing the same to the average diameter in the range of 3000 Angstroms of particle sizes in a conventionally processed Zircaloy 4 alloy.
