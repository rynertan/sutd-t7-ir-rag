# A method for producing a thin walled ceramic tube.

## Abstract
A thin walled ceramic tube having a high light transmis sion and a high dimensional precision, useful as an envelope for a high pressure lamp, is produced by an extruding process in which a stiff plastic body suitable for extruding is prepared, said body is extruded and the extruded tube is fired. The method is characterized in that the stiff plastic body consists essentally of ceramic raw material, a thermo setting organic substance and water and in that the extruded tube is hardened by heating immediately after extruding. A furnace 6 is provided immediately adjacent the extruding dies 1,2. Air is supplied into the tube interior at a pressure in the range 0.2 to 1.0 kg cmÂ² via a passage 4 in the inner die 2.
