# Oriented polypropylene film substrate and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
An oriented polypropylene film substrate and method of manufacturing an oriented polypropylene film having enhanced adhesion to metallized coatings which comprises the steps of coextruding the film substrate having a homopolymer polypropylene core layer, and an ethylene propylene outer layer on at least one side of the core layer, the core and outer layers containing no slip agent. The film substrate is biaxially oriented, and the outer layer is corona treated. A metal coating is then deposited on the corona treated outer layer.
