# Compression end pipe coupling for non metallic pipe.

## Abstract
A pipe coupling for plastics gas pipe comprises a tubular body 10 having an enlarged counterbore 14 extending inward from at least one end to receive the pipe end 22 to be coupled. A tubular stiffener 24 is seated against an inward radial shoulder 16 of the counterbore and extends in a slip fit inward or the pipe end 22 . A spacer retainer ring 28 of generally U shaped section surrounds the pipe end at the shoulder location while juxtaposed outward thereof are a complementary chamferred gripper ring 36 and locking ring 44 arranged in a ramping relation to each other. Inward threading of an end nut 56 applies sealing pressure against a contained gasket 50 while forcing the locking ring 44 axially inward until stopped by engagement against the back face of the spacer ring 28 . Concomitantly, the gripper ring 36 is collapsed inward by the ramping force of the locking ring as to effect a controlled grip relation with the pipe periphery thereat.
