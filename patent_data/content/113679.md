# SIGNAL PROCESSING METHOD IN AUTORADIOGRAPHY

## Abstract
A signal processing method in autoradiography for determination of base sequence of DNA or DNA fragment, employing groups of base specific cleavage products obtained by specifically cleaving the DNA or DNA fragment labeled with a radioactive element and resolved one dimensionally in parallel relation to each other to form resolved rows on a support medium, which comprises a process including 1 detecting sampling points in each resolved row 2 determining reference sampling points in a reference row which is practically provided on the support medium and or synthesized from the resolved rows 3 comparing the sampling points in the reference row with sampling points in a resolved row adjacent to said reference row to identify the sampling points in the adjacent resolved row, said method being applied to a digital signal corres ponding to an autoradiograph having the locational informa tion on the groups of radioactively labeled substances, said digital signal being obtained from the autoradiograph visual ized on the radiosensitive material.
