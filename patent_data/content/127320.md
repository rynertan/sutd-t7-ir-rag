# Polymeric compositions.

## Abstract
Polymeric compositions comprising 7 28 , preferably 12 to 25 , of a thermoplastic olefin polymer, 1 10 , preferably 2 to 6 , of a siloxane polymer containing 2 70 of siloxane units and at least 20 by weight of carbonate, urethane or amide units, and 69 to 90 , preferably 72 to 83 , of an elas tomer. The olefin polymer can for example be polyethylene, polypropylene, or a polar ethylene copolymer. The elastomer can be a thermoplastic elastomer, an ionomer, or a styrene butadiene copolymer. The compositions are particularly use ful in the medical field, for example in the form of tubing.
