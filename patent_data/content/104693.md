# Digital filter arrangement.

## Abstract
A sample of an output signal is calculated by forming the sum of the products of a set of samples of an input signal and a set of filter coefficients. To provide a more accurate encoding of the filter coeffi cients without great consequences for the hardware, the filter coefficients are encoded by combination of the form K1.2
