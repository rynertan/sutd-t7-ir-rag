# A device for the separation of the lighter fraction from the heavier fraction of a liquid sample.

## Abstract
A device for the separation of the lighter fraction from the heavier fraction of a liquid sample for use with two evacuated receptacles includes a housing having an interior cavity and a membrane separator dividing this cavity into a first portion and a second portion. The membrane separator has a porosity selected for the desired separation thereacross. An inlet struc ture is provided for fluid communication between the first por tion of the interior cavity and the source of the liquid sample. First structure is provided to allow fluid communication between the first portion of the interior cavity and the first evacuated receptacle. This first structure is opposed from the inlet structure so that liquid passing from the inlet to the first structure travels in a direction along the surface of the mem brane. Further structure is provided to allow fluid communica tion between the second portion of the interior cavity and the second evacuated receptacle.
