# Elastomeric copolymers, their preparation and their use.

## Abstract
The invention relates to elastomeric copolymers of an aromatic vinyl compound and a conjugated diene, suitable for use in the tread portion of a pneumatic tyre, which copo lymers have a vinyl content of at least 30 by weight and comprise at least two polymer chains coupled to one anoth er having a differential content of the aromatic vinyl com pound at the ends of the copolymer which changes in a por tion of not more than 5 of each polymer chain from a first value to a second value which is at least 25 percentage points higher than the first value, and said portion lies with in the free terminal 10 portion of the copolymer chain as determined by monomer conversion their preparation and their use in tread portions of tyres. The process of the inven tion is characterized by employing as structure modifier a compound of formula R¹ O CH₂ CH₂ O R² I wherein R and R2 are the same or different C₂ ₁₈ alkyl groups, and on completion of polymerisation polymer chains are coupled by means of a coupling agent. The copo lymers are characterized by containing a region extending over at least 50 of the polymer chain as determined by monomer conversion wherein the differential content of the aromatic vinyl compound in the polymer chain is at least 5 by weight less than the average content of the aromatic vinyl compound in the copolymer.
