# Real time character thinning system.

## Abstract
A system for providing a video output signal represent ing a thinned image from digitized video input signals representing discrete picture elements pixels of a scanned image, comprising convolver means for identifying those pixels which are to be retained as part of the thinned image, those pixels which are to be discarded, and contingent pixels which may be part of the thinned image, and matrix filter means electrically coupled to the convolver means for determining which of the contingent pixels are to be discarded and which of the contingent pixels are to be retained as part of the video output signal representing a thinned image.
