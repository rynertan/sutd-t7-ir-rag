# Extrusion apparatus and control system.

## Abstract
In a foam extrusion apparatus an extrudate thickness monitor is adapted to be positioned downstream of an extru sion die in an environmental control or vacuum chamber 146 for remote monitoring of the thickness and profile of foam boards, planks and like extrudates soon after the ex trudate exits the die and takes its final shape, which is char acterized by opposed, relatively narrow shoes 120, 78 on opposite sides of the extrudate path and respective car riages 15, 16 therefor which together are movable trans versely with respect to the extrudate path by respective worms 105, 84 and translating nuts 104, 83 and a common worm drive 155 . One shoe is operative to support the bot tom surface of the extrudate in a predetermined position while the other shoe rides on the extrudate and is position monitored by a transducer 132 operative then to provide an output signal representative of the spacing between the shoes, and thus the thickness of the extrudate passing be tween the shoes, to remote monitoring circuitry 145 lo cated outside of the vacuum chamber. Through operation of the common worm drive, extrudate thickness is measured at points along the width of the extrudate for overall thick ness and profile monitoring. Quick and responsive die ad justments then are made in response to immediate readout of product thickness and profile data thereby to minimize off specification or scrap product. Provision also is made for pivoting 110, 111 one of the shoes and respective car riage clear of the extrudate path such as in the case of a jam up.
