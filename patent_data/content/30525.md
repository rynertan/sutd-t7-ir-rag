# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FORGING SECTIONS

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus, for manufac turing sections 9, 10, 11 , preferably for manufacturing beam preforms. The method is characterized in that a blank 7 with rectangular or square cross section is forged between a pair of web tools 1, 2 , in that the web tools 1, 2 are moved to and from each other for forming a web por tion 9 on said blank 7 , and is forged against one or two flange tools 3, 4 , in that the tool or tools are moved to and from the web tools 1, 2 in a direction perpen dicular to the direction of movement of the web tools. Hereby the blank portion located between the web tools 1, 2 and respective flange tool 3, 4 is upset to one and, respectively, two flange portions 10, 11 between flange tool 3, 4 and respective sides 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 of the web tools 1, 2 . The method further is characterized in that the blank 7 successively and in steps is fed in between the web tools 1, 2 and successively and in steps is de formed by means of said tools 1, 2, 3, 4 .
