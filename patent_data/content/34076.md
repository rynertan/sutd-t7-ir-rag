# SOLENOID DRIVING SYSTEM

## Abstract
Selenoid driving system for electronically actuating in a predetermined sequence a plurality of solenoid coils 54 , said driving system including a single booster circuit 22 having an inductor 116 for receiving energy from a power supply and a capacitor 110 for storing a portion of this electrical energy prior to activation of a particular solenoid coil 54 a circuitry 40 associated with each solenoid coil 54 for energizing said solenoid coil 54 by causing the capacitor 110 to discharge therethrough and to regenerate the stored voltage potential prior to the time for energizing another solenoid coil 54 and a current regulator and mode control circuit 150, 170 to control the magnitude of current flowing through each solenoid coil 54 .
