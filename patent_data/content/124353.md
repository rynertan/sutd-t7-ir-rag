# Optical disc player.

## Abstract
An optical disc player is provided with a casing or base 21 which need not be substantially larger than a square inscribed by the circular perimeter of the compact disc 22 which it plays by causing the optical pick up 46 radially to scan the disc 22 along a path at a predetermined angle Ï‘ to the sides 48, 49, 50, 51 of the square, preferably at about 45 thereto. At the outermost position of the pick up 46 , its object lens 47 is centred at the outermost track on the disc 22 , and a corner C of the casing 21 conveniently accommodates the portion of the pick up 46 which then necessarily extends outwardly beyond the outermost track.
