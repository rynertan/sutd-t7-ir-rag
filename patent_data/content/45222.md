The present inventors undertook a diligent research for discovering a new superoxide dismutase and found that a microorganism belonging to the genus Serratia was able to produce such a new superoxide dismutase. This finding was followed by a further series of studies which have resulted in the present invention described in detail hereinafter. This invention is directed to 1 a superoxide dismutase having a defined set of properties, 2 a method for producing said superoxide dismutase characterized by cultivating a superoxide dismutase producing microorganism belonging to the genus Serratia in a culture medium to thereby cause said microorganism to elaborate and accumulate superoxide dismutase in said culture medium and harvesting said superoxide dismutase from the resulting cults broth, and 3 an antiinflammatory agent which contains an effective amount of superoxide dismutase having a defined set of properties as an active ingredient in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient therefor. The microorganism employed for production of the contemplated substance of this invention is any of the microorganisms belonging to the genus Serratia and capable of producing superoxide dismutase, inclusive of a mutant strain thereof. Among such microorganisms there are mentioned Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Serratia marinorubra, and concretely mentioned Serratia liquefaciens IFO 12979,Serratia marcescens IFO 3046, Serratia marcescens IFO 3759 ATCC 4002 , Serratia marcescens IFO 3736, Serratia marcescens E 15 ATCC 21074, Serratia marinorubra IFO 12973 ATCC 27614 . The above microorganisms designated by IFO numbers are listed up in Institute for Fermentation Osaka List ofCultures 1978 Sixth Edition, published by Institute forFermentation, Osaka, Japan, and the microorganisms designated by ATCC numbers are listed up in the American TypeCulture Collection Catalogue of Strains I Fourteenth Edition 1980 published by American Type Culture Collection,Rockville, Maryland, U.S.A. Microorganisms of the genus Serratia, in general, are liable to undergo change in characteristics and can be easily mutated by means of artificial treatments such as irradiation with X rays, ultraviolet rays or radiation, mutagenic agents nitrosoguanidine, ethyleneimine, etc. .Any of the resulting mutants can be employed for the purposes of this invention unless they have lost the ability to produce the superoxide dismutase. The production of the contemplated superoxide dismutase is carried out by cultivating said microorganism in a culture medium and harvesting and purifying the resulting elaboration product, which is the desired product, from said culture medium. The culture medium may be liquid or solid, only if it contains nutrient sources which the particular strain of microorganism can utilize, although a liquid culture medium is desirable when mass production is contemplated. Incorporated in such a medium are sources of nutrients which the microorganism can assimilate, digest or otherwise utilize, such as carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic materials, trace nutrients and so on. The carbon sources may for example be starch, dextrin, glucose, sucrose, etc., and the nitrogen sources may for example be corn steep liquor, soybean meal, extracted soybean meal, yeast extract, denucleated yeast, casein, cotton seed meal, nitrogen containing compounds such as ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, etc.The inorganic materials include, for example, sodium salts e.g. sodium chloride , phosphates e.g. sodium phosphate , calcium salts e.g. calcium carbonate , potassium.salts e.g. potassium chloride, potassium phosphate , magnesium salts e.g. magnesium sulfate , manganese salts e.g. manganese chloride, manganese carbonate , iron salts e.g. iron chloride , zinc salts e.g. zinc carbonate and so on. The trace nutrients may for example be vitamins e.g. vitamin B1, B2 , fatty acid esters e.g. esters e.g. methyl or ethyl esters of oleic acid, lauric acid, caproic acid, etc. , nucleic acids e.g. ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid , related compounds of nucleic acids e.g. inosinic acid, guanylic acid, adenylic acid and so on. For defoaming purposes, oils e.g. soybean oil, corn oil, peanut oil , synthetic antifoams e.g.Tween 20, 60 and 80 Kao Atlas Co. Ltd.,Japan , Actocol Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan , etc. may also be incorporated. The cultivation Er thod may for example be stationary culture, shake culture r aerated stir submerged aerobic culture. Submerged aerobic culture, in particular, is especially useful for production scale runs. While cultural conditions vary with the condition and composition of medium, strain of microorganism, cultural method, etc., cultivation is desirably conducted at about 20 to 400C for about 10 to 100 hours, preferably, about 20 to 72 hours, the pH of the medium being about 4 to 9 and, preferably, about 6 to 8. The desired enzyme is mostly accumulated intracellularly. This enzyme is harvested and purified by conventional purification procedures. It is advantageous to collect the cells from the culture broth by centrifugation, filtration or Ool.le other known separatory mcthod, disru ,t the cells by such a procedure as ultrasonication, grinding with glass beads, or a method involving the use of a surfactant or solvent, and extract the enzyme from the disrupted mass.In harvesting the enzyme, the same or an other known separate and purification procedure in the field of the art can be followed in any case to obtain a product of optional purity.Thus, the enzyme containing disrupted mass is centrifuged or filtered to give a supernatant or filtrate. To this enzyme extract is added ammonium sulfate or acetone, and the resulting precipitate is collected by centrifugation, dissolved in a small quantity of water, desalted by dialysis and lyophilized, whereupon a crude enzyme powder is obtained. This crude enzyme powder can be purified by means employed conventionally for purification of enzymes. By way of illustration, gel filtration with Sephadex PharmaciaFine Chemicals AB, Sweden , column chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose Serva Fine Biochimica, WestGermany or a like procedure can be followed to isolate superoxide dismutase. In this manner, superoxide dismutase can be separated and isolated in a desired purity. The enzymological and chemical properties of the superoxide dismutase obtained in Example 2 which appears hereinafter are as follows. a Activity It dismutates a superoxide ion into a hydrogen peroxide molecule and an oxygen molecule. b Substrate specificity It acts on superoxide ion. c Optimum pH range The optimum pH range of this enzyme is about 7 to 8.Fig. 1 shows a pH activity curve of this enzyme. d Stable pH range The enzyme is stable in the pH range of about 6 to 11.Fig. 2 shows a pH stability curve of this enzyme. e Optimum functional temperature About 20 to 450C. f Thermostability conditions of inactivation The enzyme was treated at pH 7.8 and various temperatures for various time periods. The enzyme is stable at 370C for 60 minutes but is inactivated about 50 when treated at 50 to 600C for 60 minutes and almost 100 when treated at 800C for 5 minutes.Fig. 3 shows a thermostability of this enzyme. g Molecular weight As determined by the gel filtration method using a Sephadex G 100 column The Biochemical Journal 91, 222 233, 1964 , this enzyme has a molecular weight of about 4.8 x 104.When the enzyme is first treated with 1 sodium laurylsulfate SDS and then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of the SDS The Journal ofBiological Chemistry 244, 5074 5080, 19691, the enzyme is 4 found to have a molecular weight of about 2.4 x 10 These values indicate that this enzyme is a dimer consisting of subunits each having a molecular weight of about 2.4 x 104. h Elemental analysis C 48.90 2.08 H 7.05 2.0 , N l4.80i2.0 i Absorptions in the ultraviolet and visible regions of th spectrum Fig. 4 shows an ultraviolet absorption spectrum of this enzyme and Fig. 5 shows a visible absorption spectrum of this enzyme. In the W region, this enzyme gives an absorption maximum at about 280 nm, an absorption minimum at about 253 nm and a shoulder at about 290 nm. The absorbance ratio 260 nm 280 nm is 1.8. In the visible region, the enzyme shows an absorption maximum at about 470 to 475 nm, an absorption minimum at 375 to 380 nm and a shoulder at about 610 nm. j Infrared absorption spectrum Fig. 6 shows an infrared absorption spectrum of this enzyme measured by the KBr method.

The enzymatic potency assay procedure is as follows.The method described in the Journal of BiologicalChemistry 244, 6049 6055 1969 is employed. Thus, a sample cell length of light pctth 1 cm is filled with 1.5 ml of 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.8 , 0.5 ml of 60 M cytochromeC, 0.5 ml of 0.6 mM ethylenediaminetetracetate sodium, 0.25 ml of 0.6 mM xanthine and 0.21 ml of the enzyme solution diluted with phosphate buffer pH 7.8 to a measurable concentration, followed by addition of 0.04 ml of xanthine oxidase solution to make a total of 3.0 ml. The cell is set on a spectrophotometer and the reaction is initiated at 250C so as to measure the initial velocity v of reduction of cytochrome C at 550 nm. As a blank, the.initial velocity V of reduction of cytochrome C in the presence of distilled water in lieu of the enzyme solution is also measured. With the amount of the enzyme causing a 50 inhibition of the initial velocity of reduction of cytochrome C under the above reaction conditions being taken as unity, the enzymatic potency is calculated by means of the following equation. v x amount of V v U mg v x of or enzyme mg l.0 ml reaction mixture Q The active dye method described in Analytical Biochemistry 44, 276 287, 1971 can also be utilized. Thus, after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the gel is immersed in 2.45 mM nitro blue tetrazolium for 20 minutes.Then, the gel is further immersed in a mixture of 28 mM tetraethylethylenediamine, 0.028 mM riboflavine and 36 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.8 for 15 minutes. The gel is put in a test tube and exposed to the light rays of a 15watt fluorescent lamp, whereupon the superoxide ion 2 generated by photoredue.e ion of riboflavine reduces the nitro blue tetrazolium rj that the moiety other than that having superoxide dismutase activity forms a blue formazan and is therefore dyed blue purplish. Proteins can be assayed by the method of Lowry TheJournal of Biological Chemistry 193, 265 275, 1951 . The superoxide dismutase according to this invention differs in physicochemical properties from the known superoxide dismutase. The known superoxide dismutase includes the one obtained from Escherichia coli B The Journal ofBiological Chemistry vol. 245, No. 22, pp. 6176 6181, 1970 and the one derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus Journal of Molecular Biology, vol. 105, pp. 333 335, 1976 .The molecular weight of the superoxide dismutase derived from Escherichia coli is 39,500 and that of the superoxide dismutase from Bacillus stearothermophilus is 40,000.Since these weight figures are significantly different from the molecular weight of the enzyme of this invention which is about 4.8 x 10 , the superoxide dismutase according to this invention is considered to be a novel enzyme. The superoxide dismutase of the present invention shows an overt inhibition of edema when a sample of 3000U mg is administered intravenously into the hind leg of the rat according to the carrageenan induced foot edema method Van Arman. C.

After six hours from said administration, edema is emerged, and then superoxide dismutase SOD 11,000 U mg.protein of the present invention is subcutaneously injected to the portion. This experiment is conducted according to the method described in Pharmacology vol. 5, pp. 215 224 1971 .The results are set forth in the following table.

The enzyme of this invention is sparingly toxic and no death is encountered even when it is intraperitoneally administered to rats at a dose of 60 mg kg. Having an antiinflammatory activity, the superoxide dismutase according to this invention is of use as an antiinflammatory agent. For the treatment of various acute or subacute inflammatory diseases or edema e.g. arthritis, bronchitis, edema due to a bruise, burn, etc. in mammalian animals e.g.mouse, rat, rabbit, cat, dog, monkey, man , the enzyme according to this invention can be administered orally or otherwise as formulated into tablets, capsule, injections, ointments or other known dosage forms at a daily dose of 1 to 5 mg kg. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient are albumin, globulin, dextran, Ficoll Type 70 Sigma Co., U.S.A. , lactose, dextrin and starch. The following examples are given to illustrate this invention in further detail without limiting its scope.Unless otherwise specified, percents are weight volume percents w v .

The disrupted cells were centrifuged to give a supernatant fluid. This supernatant was measured for superoxide dismutase activity by the above described xanthine xanthine oxidase cytochrome C method and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method. The results are set forth below in the table. It is clear that in all strains of Serratia, strong superoxide dismutase was intracellularly accumulated.

The internal fluid, i.e. 134 ml of dialysate, was put on a column 3.8 x 55.0 cm of diethylaminoethyl cellulose previously equilibrated with the same buffer and the enzyme was eluted by increasing the concentration of sodium chloride in the same buffer linearly from 0 to 250 mM to collect 54 ml of an enzymatically active eluate. ii Gel permeation on Sephadex G 100 The enzyme solution obtained in i 54 ml was put in a cellulose tube and dialyzed against 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.1 M of KC1. The internal fluid 73 ml was concentrated to 2.0 ml by ultrafiltration through aDyaflow UM 5 membrane. This concentrate was put on a column 2.6 x 74.0 cm of Sephadex G 100 equilibrated with the same buffer as above and the enzyme was eluted with the same buffer to collect an enzymatically active eluate which was red purple in color. The fractions thus obtained are constant in specific activity, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that it is a single component product. The specific activity of this Mn superoxide dismutase 2.07 mg was 12,000 U mg.protein.
