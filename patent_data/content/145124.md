# Optical fiber polarizer.

## Abstract
A fiber optic polarizer comprises an optical fiber 25 having a core 26 and cladding 27 with different refractive indices and forming a single mode guiding region, the core 26 having a non circular cross section defining two trans verse orthogonal axes which, in combination with the different refractive indices, permit the de coupling of waves polarized along the axes. The guiding region is located close to the surface 29 of the fiber 25 , and the outer surface 29 of the fiber 25 has a non circular cross section so that the location of the guiding region and the orientation of the axes can be ascertained from the geometry of the outer surface 29 . A polymeric film 40 is coupled to the fiber surface 29 that is closest to the core, the film 40 having different indices of refraction along axes aligned with the transverse orthogonal axes of the core 26 , one of the indices of refraction of the film 40 being less than the effective index of refraction of a desired wave in the guiding region of the fiber 25 , and the other index of refraction of the film 40 being greater than the effective index of refraction of an unwanted wave in the guiding region of the fiber 25 .
