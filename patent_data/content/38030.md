# Air flow system for a disk file.

## Abstract
An air flow system for a disk file is divided by a partition 14 into two compartments 15, 16 . A spindle 32 is journalled in the partition for driving both a re cording disk 18 in one compartment 15 and a fan 34 in the other compartment 16 . The fan drives air through a main filter 38 across the disk and back to an intake plenum to which make up air is also fed from a breather filter, the impedance of which is very high compared to that of the main filter. This assures that pressure in the disk compartment exceeds that of the fan compartment so that any flow of air through the spindle bearing passes through the main filter before reaching the disk thus assuring a clean atmosphere at the disk.
