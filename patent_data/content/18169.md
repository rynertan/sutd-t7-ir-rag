## Description
Fluid Pressure Operated Valves DESCRIPTION This invention relates to fluid pressure operated valves. According to the invention there is provided a fluid pressure operated valve comprising a housing in which there are tvro openings about an axis of the housing and spaced apart along the axis, an annular valve seat surrounding at least one of the openings, a valve member movable within and axially of the housing to and from an end position in which the valve member engages the valve seat with one of its opposite faces to close off fluid flow through the valve, spring means acting between the valve housing and the valve member to urge the valve member towards a position clear of the valve seat in which position there are two pressure chambers in the valve housing divided by the valve member, and fluid passage means communicating between the two pressure chambers for fluid flow in either direction through the valve from one opening, through one pressure chamber, the passage means and the other pressure chamber to the other opening. In one form of the invention there are annular valve seats surrounding the respective openings, the valve member is movable between two end positions in which the valve member engages the respective valve seats with its opposite faces to close off fluid flow through the valve and the spring means are operative to urge the valve member towards a central position clear of both valve seats. Thus, with this form of the invention, in the event of a pipeline failure downstream of the installed valve, the loss of back pressure in the pressure chamber on the downstream side of the valve member causes a sufficient pressure differential to be set up across the valve member to result in the valve member moving in a downstream direction into contact with the downstream valve seat and thus close off fluid forward flow through the valve. Conversely, in the event of a pipeline failure upstream of the installed valve, the loss of forward pressure in the pressure chamber on the upstream side of the valve member causes a sufficient pressure differential to be set up across the valve member to result in the valve member moving in an upstream direction into contact with the upstream valve seat and thus close off fluid back flow through the valve. In another form of the invention there is a single annular valve seat, the valve member is movable between two end positions in the first of which the valve member engages the single valve seat with one of its opposite faces to close off fluid flow through the valve and in the second of which the valve member engages stop means and the valve is open for fluid flow therethrough, and the spring means are operative to urge the valve member towards the second position. Thus with this latter form of the invention, and with the valve so installed that the single valve seat is on the downstream side of the valve member, in the event of a pipeline failure downstream of the installed valve, the loss of back pressure in the pressure chamber on the downstream side of the valve member causes a sufficient pressure differential to be set up across the valve member to result in the valve member moving in a downstream direction into contact with the single valve seat and thus close off fluid forward flow through the valve.Conversely, with the valve so installed that the single valve seat is on the upstream side of the valve member, in the event of a pipeline failure upstream of the installed valve, the loss of fdrward pressure in the pressure chamber on the upstream side of the valve member causes a sufficient pressure differential to be set up across the valve member to result in the valve member moving in an upstream direction into contact with the single valve seat and thus close off fluid back flow through the valve. This form of the invention can be used in instances where the risk of failure on one side of. the installed valve is minimal such as in direct connection with an appliance in a ,fluid pressure system, either at the outlet or inlet respectively of the appliance. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an axial section through one embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is an axial section through a modification of the embodiment of Fig. 1 provided with means producing a damping effect on the movement of the valve member Fig. 3 is an axial section through another embodiment of the invention Fig. 4 is an axial section of a detail of the embodiment of Fig.3 Fig. 5 is an end view of the axial section shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 6 is an axial section of a valve member in a modification of the embodiment of Fig. 3 Fig. 7 is an end view of the valve member in Fig. 6 and Fig. 8 is an axial section through a further embodiment of the invention. In Fig 1 a housing is composed of a central cylindrical hollow portion 1 and two end portions 2 and 3 capping off the ends of the portion 1. The portions 2 and 3 have corner lugs 4 apertured to receive bolts not shown by means of which the portions 1, 2 and 3 are held together. The portions 2 and 3 have annular valve seats 5. and 6 respectively disposed axially of the valve and spaced apart along the axis. The valve seats surround openings 7 which are internally screw threaded at 8 for connecting the valve into a pipeline. A valve member 9 is slidably movable within and axially of the portion 1 between two end positions in which the valve member engages the respective valve seats 5 and 6 with its opposite faces. The opposite faces of the valve member 9 are formed with annular ribs 10 to improve sealing contact with the valve seats 5 and 6. Blind holes such as shown at 11 are provided in the valve member 9 from both sides thereof and these blind holes seat compression springs such as 12 urging the valve member towards a central position clear of. both valve seats as shown where pressure chambers 13 and 14 are provided divided by the valve member. Passage means for communication between the pressure chambers 13 and 14 are provided in the form of through holes such as 15 in the valve member 9. With the valve installed in a pipeline and assuming that forward flow is from left to right in Fig. 1 fluid enters the valve through the opening 7 surrounded by the annular seat 5 and passes through the pressure chamber 13, the through holes 15 and the pressure chamber 14 and leaves through the opening surrounded by the annular seat 6. In the event of a pipeline failure downstream of the installed valve, the loss of back pressure in the pressure chamber 14 causes a sufficient pressure differential to be set up across the valve member 9 to result in the valve member moving into contact with the valve seat 6 and thus closing off fluid forward flow through the valve. Conversely, in the event of pipeline failure upstream of the installed valve, the loss of forward pressure in the pressure chamber 13 causes a differential to be set up across the valve member 9 to result in the valve member moving into contact with the valve seat 5 and thus closing off fluid back flow through the valve. Fig. 2 shows a modification of the embodiment of Fig. 1 in which the valve member 9 has a circumferential recess 16 on each side for co operation with a circumferential formation 17 projecting from the wall containing each valve seat 5, 6. The formation 17 may be integral with either the portion 2, 3 or the portion 1. Alternatively, the formation 17 may be in the form of a fixed or floating ring. Another alternative is to replace the recess 16 by a formation like 17 and the formation 17.by a recess like 16. The purpose of the recess 16 and formation 17 is to permit fluid to be partially trapped on closing movement of the valve member 9 and act as a dashpot to damp the final phase of valve closure. In Figs. 3, 4 and 5 the valve member 9 has no through holes and the passage means are replaced by slots 18 in the inner surface of the portion 1. Furthermore, instead of blind holes in the valve member 9 there is an annular slot 19 in each side of the valve member housing a single axially mounted compression spring 12. Figs. 6 and 7 show a modification of the embodiment shown inFigs. 3, 4 and 5 wherein the slots 18 are provided in the outer peripheral surface of the valve member 9 instead of in the portion 1. Fig. 8 shows another embodiment which is similar to the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2 as regards the arrangement of the compression springs 12 except that blind holes 20 are also provided in the portions 2 and 3 for receiving the springs. The embodiment of Fig. 8 also differs in that the portion 1 is integral with the portion 3 and is thicker threadedly to receive two unions 21 interconnected by an external line 22 constituting the passage means interconnecting the pressure chambers 13 and 14. The passage means could alternatively be in the form of borings in the portion 1. Each of the embodiments described and illustrated operates as a shut off valve in the event of a pipeline failure both upstream and downstream of the installed valve. Each of the embodiments could however be modified to operate, depending on the way it is installed relative to the normal direction of fluid flow, as a shut off valve in the event of a pipeline failure either upstream or downstream of the installed valve by the replacement of the springs i2 on one side of the valve member 9 by rigid stop means. In the case of the embodiments in Figs. 1 and 8 the springs 12 could be replaced by rigid projections received in the blind holes 11 on one side of the valve member 9. In the embodiment of Fig. 2 the springs 12, the blind holes 11 and the recess 16 on one side of the valve member 12 could be omitted and the formation 17 could be made axially larger. In the embodiments of Figs. 3 to 7 one of the springs 12 could be replaced by a ring received in the recess 19 in one side of the valve member 9. Whatever rigid stop means is used the remaining spring or springs 12 one side of the valve member 9 urges the valve member towards the position shown where the valve is open for fluid flow therethrough. When, due to a pipeline failure, there occurs a drop in pressure in the pressure chamber 13 or 14 occupied by the remaining spring or springs 12 the valve member 9 moves against the spring or springs to close off fluid flow through the valve.
