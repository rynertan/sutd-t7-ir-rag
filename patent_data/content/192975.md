# AN ADJUSTABLE AND COLLAPSIBLE TRIANGULATED TENSION SUPPORT STRUCTURE

## Abstract
An adjustable and collapsible triangulated tension sup port structure having a generally H shaped planar configura tion. Two vertical members are connected to a horizontal compression member and flexible diagonally crossed ten sion members extend from one vertical member to the other below the compression member. An adjustable tension member is connected to both vertical members at points located above the horizontal compression member so that tensioning of the adjustable tensioning member spreads apart the portion of the vertical member located below the horizontal compression member thereby putting the diagon ally crossed tensioning member under tension. At least on horizontal shelf bracket is connected to and extends out wardly from the upper portion of each vertical member to define a supporting surface for electronic apparatus. The structure can be collapsed for transportation by moving the vertical members together in an adjacent configuration.
