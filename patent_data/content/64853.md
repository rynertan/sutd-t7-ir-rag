# Non woven fabric and method of making same.

## Abstract
A nonwoven fabric is made by first forming a web 12 consisting predominantly of thermoplastic fibers, then pat tern embossing the web at an elevated temperature to form autogenous thermal bonds extending through the web, then creping the bonded web by pressing the bonded web against a driven, grooved roll 30 which feeds the web against a retarding member 32 . Removal of the web from the retarding member 32 is controlled so that the web is foreshortened in the driven direction and so that said grooves cause a noticeable ridge to be formed in the web. The temperature of the web during the creping step is controlled so that some of the thermoplastic fibers are softened which assists the formation and retention in the web of both the crepe and noticeable ridges 50, preferably of predominantly unbonded fibers. This heating of the web 12 also results in some bonding of fibers in the grooves 52 of the creped web 12 which gives the web 12 a striped appearance. In the creped web, when the autogenous bonds are lineal and generally extend in the cross direction of the web, the creped web can take on a seersucker or corduroy like appearance depending upon the amount of compaction during the creping step.
