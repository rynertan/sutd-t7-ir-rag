# Synthetic film with a paper like surface and method of forming same.

## Abstract
An oriented polymeric film structure comprises a layer of a thermoplastic polymeric matrix material, within which is located a strata of voids, and, positioned at least substantially within at least a substantial number of said voids, at least one void initiating solid particle which is phase distinct and incompatible with said matrix. The void space occupied by said particle is substantially less than the volume of said void, with one generally cross sectional dimension of said particle at least approximating a corresponding cross sectional dimension of said void. At least one surface of the native layer is of a paper like, non even, micro rough, microcrater containing lamellae like, random textured, ink acceptable configuration.
