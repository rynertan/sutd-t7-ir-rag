## Description
STCTURE FOR ATTACHING A COMBINATION SWITCH UN,Q A STEERING COLUMN BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a structure for attaching a combination switch to a steering column of an automotive vehicle. In conventional automotive vehicles, plural switches for a direction indicator lamp, head light, wiper and others are usually located at one place and assembled in one switch box as a unit. Such switches are called a combination switch unit which is attached to a steering column near a steering wheel in order to facilitate switching operations. Fig. 1 shows such a conventional combination switch unit attached to a steering column. Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along the line A A of Fig. 1. The reference numeral 1 generally designates a combination switch unit for a direction indicator lamp, a head light and a wiper not shown . The combination switch unity includes a switch box la, an operation lever lb placed at a side of the switch box la for operating a direction indicator lamp switch and a head light switch not shown , and an operation level lc for operating a wiper switch not shown . A fixing portion ld is formed in the switch box la for attaching the combination switch unit 1 to a steering column 4. The fixing portion ld is formed with a hole for fixing it.A steeing wheel 2 is placed above an upper portion of the combination switch unit 1 as shown by the chain line in Fig. 1. The steering column 4 is placed around a steering shaft 3. The steering column 4 has an opening 4a Fig. 2 for locating the combination switch unit 1 in position. In Fig. 2, a binding band 5 is made of a metal and used for attaching the combination switch unit 1 to the steering column 4. The binding band 5 has at one end thereof an opening corresponding in position to an opening of the fixing portion Id of the combination switch 1 through which a screw 7a is to pass. The binding band 5 also has at its intermediate portion a projection 5a for locating the combination switch unit 1 in such a way that it cooperates with the opening 4a of the steering column 4.An auxiliary band 6 made of a metal is used so as to fix the other end of the binding band 5 to the fixing portion ld.The reference numeral 7b denotes a nut to be used togehter with the screw 7a. In order to attach the combination switch unit 1 to the steering column 4, the fixing portion ld of the combination switch unit I is moved along the steering column 4. When the fixing portion ld comes to a predetermined position of the steering column 4, the binding band 5 is attached to the fixing portion ld of the combination switch unit 1 so as to bind the steering column 4. First, one end of the binding band 5 is .tentatively fixed by means of the auxiliary band 6.Thereafter, the combination switch unit 1 is rotated along the steering column 4 until the projection 5a mates and engages with the opening 4a of the steering column 4.Finally the fixing screw 7a is screwed with the opening of the fixing portion 1d of the combination switch unit 1. By crewing the nut 7b with the screw 7a, the binding band 5 is forced to bind the steering column 4 to the fixing portion ld of the combination switch unit 1. As a result, the combination switch unit 1 is properly fixed to the steering column 4. Fig. 3 shows another conventional combination switch unit 1 attached to a steering column 4. The same references designate the same or corresponding members as in Fig. 2. Two openings though which screws 7a pass are formed in both ends of the fixing portion ld of the combination switch unit 1. The binding band 5 also has two holes corresponding thereto at both ends thereof. When the combination switch unit 1 is moved along the steering column 4 to a predetermined position, one of the screws 7a is inserted into one of the openings of.the fixing portion ld of the combination switch unit 1 and screwed with the nut 7b. After the projection 5a for locating the binding band 5 mates exactly with the opening 4a of the steering column 4, the binding band 5 is fixed by means of the other nut 7b and screw 7a. In such conventional structures, the binding band 5 is completely separate from the combination switch unit 1. In addition, the projection 5a which is means for locating the combination switch unit 1 is formed on the binding band 5. For such a reason, usually some clearance is formed between the fixing portion 1d of the combination switch unit 1 and the binding band 5 so that, when the combination switch unit 1 is rotated around the steering column 4 in order to locate the combination switch unit 1, particularly if the combination switch unit 1 slightly moves, the projection 5a of the binding band 5 does not move precisely. It is difficult to check exactly the time when the projection 5a of the binding band 5 mates or engages with the opening 4a of the steering column 4. Accordingly, the locating operation is difficult and requires long time. Before the projection Sa of the binding band 5 mates exactly with the opening 4a of the steering column 4, an operator is apt to misunderstand that they were mated with each other. In such a case, the binding band 5 is fixed in a wrong position.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a structure for attaching a combination switch unit to a steering column of an automotive vehicle in which a switch box can be easily and precisely located with respect to the steering column so as to facilitate assembling thereof.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS This invention will become more apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment of this invention when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a schematic perspective view showing a conventional combination switch unit attached to a steering column of an automotive vehicle Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along the lineA A of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a sectional view showing another conventional combination switch unit attached to the steering column, corresponding to Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a perspective view showing a combination switch unit attached to a steering column of an automotive vehicle according to this invention Fig. 5 is a perspective view showing a binding band for attaching the combination switch unit shown inFig. 4 Fig. 6 is a sectional view showing a condition in which the binding band shown in Fig. 5 is wound around the fixing portion of the combination switch unit Fig. 7A is a sectional view showing a condition in which the steering column is just to be attached to the combination switch unit, corresponding to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7B is a sectional view showing a condition in which the combination switch unit has been attached to the steering column. .DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF m PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to Fig. 4, a combination switch unit 10 according to this invention has a switch box lOa. A plurality of switches for a direction indicator lamp, a head light, a wiper and others are arranged inside of the switch box l0a in a conventional manner although not shown.An operation lever lOb for operating the direction indicator lamp switch, the head light switch and other switches, and an operation lever lOc for operating the wiper switch are provided at opposite sides of the switch box lOa. Such a construction of the switch box l0a is substantially the same as in the prior art combination switch unit so that it will not be explained in detail. As shown in Figs. 4 and 6, a cylindrical pipe shape of fixing portion lOd is formed at and extends downwardly from a lower central portion of the switch box lOa. The fixing portion lOd has four resilient pieces lOf formed by four slits l0e. A locating projection 11 is provided at an inner central portion of one piece lOf among those resilient pieces lOf. The resilient piece 10f having the locating projection 11 has width n a . The locating projection 11 has a pair of tapered surfaces lla at both opposite upper and lower sides thereof as best shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 5 shows a binding band 13 which is used to fix the combination switch unit 10 to a steering column 4 of an automotive vehicle Fig. 1 . The binding band 13 has a band body 13a and a pair of binding portions 13b each integrally formed with the band body 13a. The distance between the two binding portions 13b is b . A binding opening 13c is formed in a central portion of each binding portion 13b. Referring to Figs. 6, 7A and 7B, the operation of attaching the combination switch unit 10 to the steering column 14 will be explained hereinafter. Before they are assembled, the binding band 13 is tentatively attached to the fixing portion lOd of the combination switch unit 10 as shown in Fig. 6. In this condition, the screw l5a is loosely inserted into one of the binding openings 13c of the binding portions 13b of the binding band 13, and the width a of the resilient piece lOf is smaller than the distance b between the two binding portions 13b, After the steering column 14 is inserted into the fixing portion lOd of the combination switch unit 10, the combination switch unit 10 is pushed downwardly in the direction shown by the arrow in Fig. 7A. The opposite tapered surfaces lla of the locating projection 11 on the resilient piece lOf abut against an upper portion of the steering column 14. Thus, the resilient piece lOf having the locating projection 11 is deformed outwardly.The combination switch unit 10 is further moved so that the steering column 14 is inserted into the fixing portion lOd of the combination switch 10 like in Fig. 1. After a lower central portion of the switch box l0a of the combination switch unit 10 contacts the upper end of the steering column 14, the combination switch unit 10 is rotated around the steering column 14 until the locating projection 11 on the resilient piece lOf mates exactly with the hole 14a of the steering column 14. When the locating projection 11 engages the locating hole 14a of the steering column 14, some abutting sound is produced. Immediately thereafter, the resilient piece lOf comes to its original position by means of its spring force.An operator can definitely hear such an abutment sound so as to recognize that the combination switch unit 10 is properly set in position to the steering column 14. As the locating projection 11 is formed on the fixing portion lOd of the combination switch unit 10, no clearance is formed between the combination switch unit 10 and the locating projection 11. Thus, when the combination switch unit 10 is even slightly rotated in order to locate it, such movement of the combination switch unit 10 is directly and precisely transmitted to the locating projection 11. The combination switch unit 10 and the steering column 14 are bound by the screw 15a until the combination switch unit 10 tightly contacts the steering column 14. At that time, the distance b between the two binding portions 13b becomes smaller than the width art of the resilient piece lOf. The combination switch unit 10 has been properly attached to the steering column 14 as shown in Fig. 7b. Incidentally, disassembling of those members can be carried out in reverse order. Because the locating projection 11 has the pair of tapered surfaces lla, disassembling is easy. Although in the above stated embodiment the fixing portion lOd of the combination switch unit 10 has four slits 10e, this invention is not limited to such an embodiment only. The fixing portion lOd of the combination switch unit 10 may have any other portion formed with the locating projection which portion can be outwardly deformed. As can be seen from the foregoing, according to this invention, a switch box is integrally formed with a fixing portion which can be engaged with a steering column of an automotive vehicle. A locating projection is formed on an inner surface of the fixing portion and can engage a recess portion or hole formed in the steering column. The locating projection is positioned at a predetermined position of the fixing portion which can be outwardly deformed resiliently. Therefore, when the combination switch unit is rotated around the steering column for the locating purpose, even slight movement of the combination switch unit can be precisely transmitted to the locating projection. An operator can quickly and precisely check that the locating projection mates and engages with the locating hole opening or recess portion of the steering column. For such a reason, locating operation is easy and precise. An operator can avoid miss operations such that a binding band is bound before the locating projection exactly mates with the locating opening or recess portion of the steering column.
