# Carrying handle.

## Abstract
The handle 10 includes an elongate grip 12 con structed of a compliant material such as a moulded foam rubber or plastic, and having a pair of longitudinally extend ing parallel grooves 16 and 17 on its upper surface, one adjacent each of the grip sides. The grip 12 is moulded around an elongate rigid member 13 which serves to rein force the grip throughout its entire length. A half shell metal frame 14 which is generally U shaped in cross section, has its side edges received in the grooves 16 and 17 of the grip 12 and fits on the grip so that it covers the top and part of the sides of the grip 12. Mounting stanchions 15 are pro vided ad each end of the handle assembly 10 and are fixed to the top surface 11 of a luggage case, beauty case, or the like. Each stanchion 15 includes a stub shaft 30 which is pivotally received in an opening 31 in an end of the half shell frame 14 and locates in an opening reinforcing member 13.
