# Apparatus for altering pitch in an arrangement of wafers.

## Abstract
An wafer arrangement pitch altering apparatus compri sing a pair of cylindrical grooved cams 1A, 1B parallelly disposed, a plurality of grooves 10 formed to intersect a given generatrix of the grooved cams 1A, 1B with respecti vely equal pitches, disposed symmetrically with each other aroung the peripheral surfaces of the cylindrical grooved cams 1A, 1B and intersections of the generatrix and the cylindrical grooved cams are moved at mutually dissimilar desired proportions along the axes of the cylindrical grooved cams 1A, 1B in consequence of their rotation, plural pairs of moving elements 2A, 20 disposed between the cylindrical grooved cams 1A, 1B facing each other and provided with pins 20A, 20B fitting into the grooves 10 on the correspon ding cylindrical grooved cams 1A, 1B , a pair of means 3A, 3B for retaining the moving elements in a manner movable only in the axial direction of the cylindrical grooved cams 1A, 1B , a cylindrical grooved cam driving element for rotating the cylindrical grooved cams by a prescribed angle in the mutually opposite directions, main grooves 21 formed on the opposed surfaces of the moving elements 2A, 2B and provided in the lower portions thereof with step like parts adapted to receive wafers, a pair of support frames 7A, 7B for severally holding in place the pairs of cylindrical grooved cams 1A, 1B and retaining means 3A, 3B , and a support frame moving element for altering the relative spacing of the pair of support frames.
