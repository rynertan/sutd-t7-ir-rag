## Description
SPECIFICATIONImprovements in or relating to a runner.This invention relates to a runner and is particularly concerned with a runner having both the function of a castor wheel and a support wheel.A runner of this kind is known DE OS 18 16 213 . In the known runner the pivot axis of which is not located under the pivot bearing for which reason the fork member always aligns such as in moving direction to be positioned behind the pivot bearing. In the rear portion of the runner, as viewed in moving direction, there is also arranged an actuating member upon which operation the runner or castor wheel, respectively, which is rotatable around a vertical axis, will charge the function of a support wheel which is locked in this degree of freedom.If this known kind of runner is used for pushing or moving a garbage container or a similar article which requires to move, it is preferable to lock the two front runners, as viewed in moving direction, thus obtaining support wheels enabling the container to be moved and traced easily and correctly even on bumpy or broken ground. When applying such known runners to garbage containers the actuating member, which is operated in the rear portion of the runner, disappears underneath the container and is therefore not accessible to operation. To operate the actuating member the garbage container has to be moved first by a certain distance in a direction opposite to the moving direction actually desired until the rear runners have aligned such that the actuating member is accessible to operation.Thereafter, the container can be moved in the desired direction with the runners properly aligning and finally automatically locking. By reason of this bothersome operation this known kind of runner could not work successfully with garbage containers or similar articles.Thus the present invention is based on the problem of further developing the known runner in such a way that the operation for changing the function of a castor wheel into the function of a support wheel, required for use with garbage containers or similar articles, may be effected as easily and quickly as possible without bothersome manoeuvering actions and changes in direction.Due to the fact that the actuating member is fixed to the fork member such as to be freely rotatable therewith, same alway aligns so as to comply with the track alignment of the runner per Se. If according to one aspect of the present invention, the actuating member is arranged in the front portion of the runner, as viewed in moving direction, the runners according to the present invention may be fixed on the front side of a garbage container or similar article which requires to move, so as to be easily foot operated from the upper side for locking the castor wheel in order to obatain the function of a support wheel, since the actuating member, which projects forwardly of the container, is freely accessible to operation.In addition, if the runner is arranged in the corner portion of the container, the actuating member may be arranged laterally with reference to the moving direction, i.e. in a portion being approximately at right angles to the moving direction, so that the actuating member is operable from the lateral side of the container with the runners aligned in moving direction. According to another aspect of the present invention the runner is provided with two click stop positions or registers arranged vertically to each other thus offering two independent, vertical moving directions in case that the runners are used with garbage containers or similar articles. Further, the operation of the actuating member of each runner for locking same in order to obtain support wheels may be effected easily from the front or lateral side of the container, as viewed in moving direction.A runner according to the present invention is adapted such as to charge both the function of a castor wheel and a support wheel, and can be operated easily and quickly without requiring bothersome manoeuvering actions and changes in direction.An embodiment of the invention will now be described with.reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a cross sectional view in diagrammatic re presentation of a runner charging the function of a castor wheel,Figure 2 is a top view of the runner shown in fig.1,Figure 3 is a cross sectional view in diagrammatic re presentation of a runner charging the function of a support wheel, andFigure 4 is a top view of the runner shown in fig.3. With reference to fig.1, a runner is provided with a pivot bearing 5 comprising a bearing member 6 having bores 7 fig.2 for securing the runner to an article which is required to move. A fork member 8 is fixed to the bearing 5, and the runner 9 is supported in the fork member 8 by means of a pivot axis 10. The pivot axis 10 is arranged laterally of the vertical axis 11 of the pivot bearing 5 in order to effect track alignment of the runner 9.An actuating member, which is provided in form of a lever 12, is fixed to the pivot bearing 5 so as to be pivotable about an axis 13. On the upper side of the lever 12 on the free end of which there is provided a pin formed as a tongue 14 which engages in a corresponding cavity , groove or similar opening 15 formed in the bearing member 15.On the other end of the lever 72, which is pivotally connected to the axis t3, there are provided spring surfaces 16 and 17 by means of which the lever 12 is maintained either in operating or non operating position figs. 1 and 2 respectively . A leaf spring 18 rests with its free end against the spring surfaces 16 and 17 of the lever 12, the other end of the leaf spring 18 being fixed to the pivot bearing 5.Within the range of the groove 15 the bearing member 5 shows an inclined portion 20 having a wedge surface 21 arranged to both sides of the groove 15, so that the bearing member 6 may be easily attached with its plane surface, for example, to the bottom side of a container or similar article and, on the other hand, that the lever 12 can be, operated with the runner being locked not in any position, but merely in a position which is determined by the groove 15 when the tongue 14 is moved along the wedge surface 21 and finally engaged in the groove 15. In figure 3 and 4 there is shown the runner of fig. 1 in locked condition, i.e. as a support wheel. The only difference between fig.1 and fig.3 is that the lever 12 is shown in operation, i.e. in swung up condition, with the tongue 14 and the groove 15 being engaged. As the features mentioned in connection with figs b and 2 do also apply to figs. 3 and 4 a detailed description is not repeated anymore.
