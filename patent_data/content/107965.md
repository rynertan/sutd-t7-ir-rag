# DOT MATRIX PRINTERS AND PRINT HEAD THEREFOR

## Abstract
Several new print heads are disclosed for use in serial and line printers. The print head is of the solenoid operated type without stored energy magnets and has a very low mass armature beam which the solenoid specifications are matched for performance at less than 300 microseconds. Damper mechanisms are provided for absorbing recoil sufficiently that refire rates of 350 microseconds or less are achieved. A new lightweight line printer is based on the low and the overall mass of the disclosed print head. Serial printers are also disclosed.
