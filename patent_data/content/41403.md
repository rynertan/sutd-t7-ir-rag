# Method and apparatus for ultrasonic wave measurement of characteristics of the internal structure of an object.

## Abstract
Ultrasonic wave beams BM of two different frequencies f₁, f₂ are sent into an object for determining attenuation characteristics of the internal structure of the object. The intensities, that is the energies of ultrasonic waves reflected from the internal structure of the object are measured. On the basis of these intensities, and on the basis of measured time intervals between ultrasonic wave transmission into the object and reception of reflected waves, attenuation charac teristics are measured. Attenuation coefficient and attenua tion slope may be measured.
