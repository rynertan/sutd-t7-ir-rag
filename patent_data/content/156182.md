# Optical connector ferrule and process for production thereof.

## Abstract
An optical connector ferrule and a method for producing such an optical connector ferrule wherein the bonding be tween a metal sleeve and the main body of the ferrule, which is made of a synthetic resin material, is markedly improved. A rearward end of the metal sleeve is embedded in the synthetic resin material, preferably around a flange of the main body. The metal sleeve may be provided with irregularities on one or both of the inner and outer surfaces thereof to further improve the adhesion between the resin of the main body and the metal sleeve.
