# Apparatus for the post treatment, particularly the cooling of articles subjected to an isostatic pressing process.

## Abstract
There is described an apparatus for the cooling of shaped articles subjected to an isostatic pressing process, which comprises at least one injector 14 which is connected to a high pressure line 15 for fresh gas and is mounted inside a housing 12 which communicates through a valve 16 with the space 18 , in such a way that due to the action of said injector 14 , an increased gas circulation is promoted be tween said space 18 and loading space 8 , particularly be tween the higher and lower areas of said loading space, whereby a faster and more uniform cooling is obtained inside the complete loading space 8 .
