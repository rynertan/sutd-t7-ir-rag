## Description
ELECTRODES HAVING MIXED METAL OXIDE CATALYST COATINGS PfflD METHODS FOR PRODUCTING SUCR ELECTRODES EllED OF THE THE This invention relates to the art of electrode catalyst coatings and, more specifically, to mixed metal oxide coatings on anodes and cathodes to be used for electrolytic processes, such as the electrolysis of alkali metal halide solutions, water electrolysis, electrawinning, the operation of fuel cells, electro organic syntheses and the like. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Electrolytic processes are utilized in the manufacture of many essential basic chemicals required in industrial societies.Among these are chlorine and caustic soda sodium hydroxide .These basic chemicals are generally produced in electrolysis cells having anodes and cathodes and a brine solution electrolyte.Various cell designs have been utilized, including originally flowing mercury cathode type cells and, more recently, diaphragm type electrolytic cells and cells having cation exchange nedbranes. Originally, graphite was used as an anode both in mercury cells and in diaphragm cells. With the introducti of dimen sionally stable anodes, it became common practice to utilize anodes having a valve metal substrate with an electroconductive catalytic coating, usually containing precious metals or oxides thereof, in place of the graphite formerly used. Because of the ever increasing and high cost of precious metals, the cost of operating such cells is high, both in terms of original conversion to the incorporation of diiris ionally t le anodes and recoating of the anodes once the coating has deteriorated through use. Throughout the history of diaphragn and membrane type cells, it has been to utilize mild steel mesh as a cathode material, since other cathode materials are either cost prohibitive or not yet fully coe cialized. In recent years, interest in oxygen or air depolarized electrodes has been increasing substantially, because gas epolarized electrodes and processes using them are highly energy efficient. Development is under way in order to utilize such electrodes in the dilor a3kali industry.Such gas depolar ized electrodes are generally constructed of a hydrophobic polymer material, such as polytetrafluorcet1 lene PThE , along with an electroconductive material, such as carbon black or precious metal blacks on a porous substrate. Again, as with dimensionallystable anodes, an electrocatalyst generally comprising precious metals or oxides thereof is utilized to effect the reduction of oxygen gas at the electrode gas electrolyte interface. Only the dimensionally stable anode has found commercial utility in industrial electrolytic processes, because the reduction in production costs offsets the substantial investment in precious metal catalysts employed therewith. A less expensive but comparably effective electrocatalyst would be of extreme value in the industry. It is knawn in the art of catalysis to employ a nickel cobalt oxide spinel form of catalyst. Thus, G3 PS 1,461,764 describes the preparation of nickel oxide cobalt oxide spinel catalysts by coprecipitating the metal ions upon a substrate fran the corresponding oxalates or by freeze drying the metal nitrates in solution with liquid nitrogen and depositing them on the elec trode substrate, prior to thermal decomposition. these processes are very complex and require the use of highly sophisticated equipment not necessitated by the present invention.Also, thermal decoMposition of nitrates creates hazardous oxides of nitrogen, which must be disposed of. It is also known in the art to produce an electroconductive layer utilizing organatetallic compounds. Thus GB PS 1,416,072, describes the production of transparent electrodes, whereby organometallic cceFxtrds are spray coated on to glass or other transparent substrates and heated to a high temperature 500 to 7000C to produce a thin transparent layer of electroconductive metal oxide glass on the substrate surface. Such electrodes are utilized in electroluminescent flat display devices. US PS 3,528,857 discloses the use of a spinel form catalyst of the formula NiCo204 for fuel cell electrodes. The catalytic spinel is formed by dissolving inorganic salts of nickel and cobalt in a suitable solvent and then converting them to the hydroxides and drying, prior to heating in air to produce the spinel form oxide. The resultant material may then be oompressed to give a porous electrode structure. Alternatively, a solution of nickel and cobalt inorganic salts may be applied by immersing an electrode structure in the solution, followed by drying any heating to convert the nickel and cobalt salts to the spinelform oxide. US PS 3,663,280 describes the use of an organo metallic compound of a filmrforming metal, such as titanium, zirconium, niobium, tantalum or tungsten, to produce a film,forming metal oxide coating on the surface of filmrforming me tal anodes having a precious metal catalyst applied thereto. Preferred organometallic compounds are the alkoxides or alkoxy halides of filmforming metals, such as titanates or chlorotitanates. The coating serves as an inhibitor to anode base metal corrosion in the enviranment of an electrcchemical cell. US PS 3,977,958 describes the use of a single metal spinel of cobalt oxide as an anode coating for chlor alkali electrolysis.The cobalt salt of a long chain fatty acid is applied to the surface of a titanium anode substrate and heated to decompose the salt to produce the desired cobalt oxide spinel structure. The coating optionally includes modifier oxides, which are oxides of metals selected from Groups m s to VII B and Groups IIl A to V A of the Periodic Table, and the lanthanides and actinides. A similar modifier oxide may be used, according to USiPS 4,061,549, with a bimetallic oxide spinel structure of the formula MxCo3 xO4, where x is greater than O and less than or equal to 1 and where M is a metal selected frau Groups I , II A or II B of the PeriodicTable. The mixed metal spinel structure is obtained by applying mixed inorganic salts of cobalt and the selected metal in a volatile carrier to the surface of an anode structure. While spinel fo n oxide structures have been successfully produced upon electrode surfaces directly from solutions of metal compounds, perovskite phases reqire the preparation of the oxide in solid powder form, followed by affixing the powder to an electrode substra ith a binder. See US PS 3,917,525, 4,010,091 and 4,042,483. It has now been discovered that electrocatalytic coatings for electrodes can be invade, using nonprecious metal oxides and this results in a substantial lowering of the cost of such coated electrodes The invention thus provides jirpraved electrodes made by a method, wherein the surface of an electrode substrate, selected fran electrically conductive metals and metals having an electrically nonductive coating thereon, is first prepared and is then provided with a coating of an electrocatalytic mixture of metal oxides. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the elec trica1ly uctive coating is prepared by applying to the surface of the electrode substrate a mixture of at least two metal organic compounds, such ndxblre comprising an organic carpund of at least one first metal selected fran iron, nickel, manganese, yttrium, lanthanum, the rare earth metals, thallium, lead, bismuth and metals selected from Groups IA, IIA, IB and IIB of the PeriodicTable, and an organic compound of at least one second metal different fram the first metal or metals and selected fran manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, titanium, zirconium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, ruthenium, osmium, Rhodium, iridium, palladium, platinum, aluminium, thallium, lead and bismuth, and heating the coated electrode substrate in an oxidizing atmosphere to an elevated teeerature sufficient to convert the mixture of at least two metal organic compounds intn a mixed metal oxide electro catalyst coating. By operating in accordance with the, invention, the two or more selected metal organic ccnçxvands described are cxidized on the surf ace the electrode to produce mixed metal oxides in spinel, bronze or perovskite form, which lower the voltage required for the electrode reaction in electrolytic processes andlor offer greatly increased lifetimes in strong electrolytes. Further in accordance with the invention, the above described at least two metal organic compounds are applied to an electrically conductive substrate. As used in this specification, the term substrate will be understood to indude electrically conductive metals and alloys thereof as well as electrically conductive coatings of metals and metal oxides which completely coat the surface of the electrode and act as a supporting substrate for the metal organic compounds used in accordance with the invention.Thus, the substrates wiil be understood to include iron, nickel, cobalt, copper, titanium, vanadium, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, platinum, silver, gold, palladium, lead, alloys of any of these metals, and coatings on such metals of tin oxide and antimony oxide, tin oxide and indium oxide, tin oxide and bismuth oxide, lead dioxide, and the precious metals and oxides thereof. Further in accordance with the invention an anode substrate selected from a group consisting of titanium, tantalum, zirconium, niobium or other valve metal or alloy thereof is coated with a mixture of metal organic compounds which is then dried and cured at elevated temperatures to oxidize the metal components to their oxide form and create a mixed metal oxide structure on the surface of the anode substrate.The anode may then be used in electrolytic processes such as the electrolysis of water, sodium chloride, electroorganic synthesis and the like Further in accordance with the inventions a cathode substrate selected from a group consisting of iron, nickel, cobalt, alloys thereof, and airloxygen cathode substrates such as porous graphite or porous metal or carbon blacklPTFE substrates is coated with a mixture of at least two metal organic compounds of the type described. The coated cathodes are then dried and cured at an elevated temperature to oxidize the metal components of the coating to their oxide form and to create a mixed metal oxide structure on the surface of the cathode substrat . The cathode may be applied to use in electrolytic processes, such as the electrolysis of sodium chloride, to make chlorine and caustic or as an oxygen reduction electrode in a fuel cell or other electrolysis device. Still further iri accordance with the invention, a coating of mixed metal oxides may be deposited on electrode substrates using metal organic compounds of the type described, applying same by painting, spraying, dipping or vapor depositing on the substrate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFEPvRED EMBODIMENTS The invention will now be more clearly described in the more limited aspects of preferred embodiments thereof. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that deviations from the exemplary embodiments are possible and that it is intended that the scope of the invention not be limited to only those specific embodiments set forth hereinafter. In accordance with the invention, a mixture of at least two metal organic compounds is applied to the surface of an electrode substrate. The organometallic compounds generally comprise metal complexes or salts of organic acids. The above described at least two metal organic compounds comprise organic compounds of a first metal selected from a grow consisting of manganese, iron, nickel, yttrium, lanthanum, the rare earth metals thallium, lead, bismuth and metals from periodic groups IA, IL , IB and Iia, and at least one additional metal which differs from such first metal selected from a group consisting of manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, titanium, zirconium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, platinum, aluminum, thallium, lead, and bismuth. The metal organic compounds of the selected metals are then heated on the surf ace of the electrode substrate to form a mixed metal oxide coating on the surface of the electrode. Electrode substrates used in the invention are generally electrically conductive metals or electrically conductive coatings on basis metals. Thus, depending on the type of application desired for the resultant electrode, the substrate may comprise iron, nickel, cobalt, copper, gold, silver, platinum, iridium, rhenium, palladium, titanium, vanadium, zirconium, niobium, tantalum, lead, alloys of these metals and any of these metals having a coating thereon of tin oxide and antimony oxide, tin oxide and indium oxide, tin oxide and bismuth oxide, lead dioxide, or precious metals andlor their oxides. The substrate may take the form of a solid sheet, perforated plate, expanded metal mesh, wird screen, porous solid or any similar structure. The electrode substrate may be coated by painting, spraying, immersion or other coating process using a solution of the selected metal organic compounds in a carrier such as an organic solvent such as ethanol or the like.The coated substrate is then heated to evaporate the carrier solution and to oxidize the metallic components and create the desired spinel or perovskite oxide structure accordance with the invention, an electrode substrate is selected and prepared for use by cleaning. When an anode is selected as the electrode to be coated, the substrate material may be any of the various anode substrate metals common in the art but, preferably, are valve metals, such as titanium, tantalum, niobium, vanadium or zirconium. The anode substrate material is cleaned and, preferably, etched in any cleaning solvent which will give a properly prepared surface, such as immersion in boiling acid solutions.The substrate may also be a valve metal base having a thin coating of precious metals or oxides thereof applied thereto with cleaning procedures modified accordingly. The metal organic compounds utilized in the present invention may be metal salts of organic acids. Various compositions of such meta organic compounds are available commercially from Mooney Chemicals of Cleveland,Ohio, such as 10 percent Nickel HEX CEM, which is a nickel salt of 2ethylhexanoic acid 12 percent Cobalt HEX CEM, which is, likewise, a cobalt salt of 2 ethylhexanoic acid and 6 percent Manganese TEN CE.M, which is a manganese salt of neodecanoic acid. Optionally, the desired metal organic compounds may be prepared by normal laboratory methods known to those skilled in the art. On a smooth substrate, such as a valve metal anode, the metal organic compound may be applied by any method, but the preferred method is by spraying or painting the material onto the electrode.In practice, several layers of coating may be required to build up sufficient thickness of material for effective catalytic activity and coating lifetime in electrolytic processes. The material is heated for a short period of time between each successive coating to dry same prior to the application of the next coat. In one preferred embodiment utilizing a valve metal anode substrate, an initial coating of antimony doped tin oxide as substrate is applied to the metal prior to the application of the metal organic compounds. While this procedure is not necessary to the feasibility of the coating, it does offer an improved surface for the organometallic and results in a smoother, more lustrous appearance in the final electrode surface. Without the use of the antimony doped tin oxide coating, the surface has a grainy, matte appearance. Further, the coating has been found to be denser and more adherent and, thus, more durable when the antimony doped tin oxide substrate is utilized. Following the application of the metal organic compounds, the coated electrode is heated to about 25DOC for at least 15 minutes. The heating temperature may range from 2000C to 800 C and may last for a period of 15 to 60 minutes. The coating in accordance with the invention may also be applied to electrodes to be used as cathodes in electrolytic processes and, for smooth substrates such as steel or nickel cathodes, with a procedure identical to that applied to anode substrates being utilized. If the electrode substrate is of a porous nature, such as sintered porous nickel, porous graphite or a porous oxygen electrode substrate, such as a mixture of carbon black and Teflon, the coating method may be modified in that the porous substrate is immersed in a solution of metal organic coating material, so that the metal organic compounds soak into the porous structure of the electrode. Thus, only one immersion rather than a multiplicity of coatings is necessary. Treatment of the coating to produce the mixed metallic oxide is otherwise the same. Another and more preferred method employed where an oxygen electrode is comprised of particulate or powdered carbon and a binder component such as Teflon is to mix the metal organic compounds with the carbon and heat to form the oxide prior to mixing with the binder and pressing and or sintering into the final electrode form. Other methods of coating, such as painting or spraying, may be used. Further, since the coating is internal on a porous substrate, the antimony doped tin oxide coating step is not utilized. The above procedures utilizing a mixture of at least two metal organic compounds selected from iron, nickel, cobalt and manganese form a spinel oxide structure when baked to oxidizing temperatures in accordance with the above outlined procedures. The addition or substitution of other metals may serve to alter the crystalline structure of the coating to a perovskite or a bronze type structure. Further, such additions and substitutions may serve to increase the electrical conductivity of the catalyst, improve the chemical and electro chemical stability of the coating and or adjust the overvoltage for the preferential discharge of certain ions in electrochemical processes. When such additional metals are utilized, the metal organic compounds are mixed with the other selected metal organics and applied in the same manner as outlined above. The following examples will serve to illustrate the invention and its preferred embodiments. Such examples should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention nor the claims appearing hereinafter.

The cold pressed substrate was soaked in a solution of 1.0 g of 10 Ni HEX CEM Ni salt of 2 ethylhexanoic acid,Mooney Chemicals , and 30 ml of ethanol and then sintered at 35000 for 10 minutes at 10,000 Ibs. ram pressure. The electrode was operated as an 02 cathode in 400 gpl caustic, 600C, 22 mm Hg at 0.31 A cm2 and showed a 350 mv vs. Hg HgO cathode potential. EXAMPLE 15 Stoichiometric amounts of nickel and cobalt HEX CEM to make carbon loaded with 30 Nice204 was added to carbon powder Vulcan XC72R .This mixture was fired in a furnace at 25000 overnight to oxidize the metal organic compounds to NiOo2O4 spinel. This material was then mixed with Teflon 30 in an alcohol and water mixture and formed into a sheet. The sheet was then air dried and pressed into a current distribution mesh nickel and sintered a 35000. When operated as an oxygen cathode in concentrated NaOH solution, stable performance at 0.31 amps per square centimeter was noted with a potential of 0.42 volts vs. an Hg HgO electrode.
