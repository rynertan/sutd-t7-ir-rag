# Flow regulating device.

## Abstract
A flow regulating device provides continuous, regulated flow of a medical fluid, as well as intermittent, manually controlled larger flows of fluid to a catheter system. Such apparatus includes a control member having an inlet means adapted to be connected by tubing to a source of medical fluid and an outlet means adapted to be connected by tubing to a catheter. A flexible conduit defines at least a portion of a first passage between the inlet means and outlet means of the control member. Positioned in the flexible conduit is valve means adapted to open when the conduit is squeezed, thereby providing the larger, intermittent, manually control led flow of fluid to the catheter system, and to automatically close when the conduit is released. A second passage in the control member connects the inlet and outlet means, and in combination with flow restriction means therein, provides the continuous, regulated flow of fluid to the catheter system.
