# Powder dispenser.

## Abstract
In a powder dispenser comprising a container 1 in which powder is supported on a screen 3, water under pressure for forming a concentrated solution or dispersion with the powder is introduced into a tube 12 beneath the screen. The tube contains a plurality of apertures 14 along its length and is rotatably mounted substantially mid length so that an upwardly directed spray of water is directed from the tube 14 through the screen 3 onto the bottom layers of powder thereon with a sprinkler effect as the tube is rotated. Tube rotation is preferably imparted automatically under the reaction forces of the water leaving the apertures 14 which are offset from the vertical in opposite senses on each side of the rotary axis.
