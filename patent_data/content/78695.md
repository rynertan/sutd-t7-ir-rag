# PATCH CLOSURE SYSTEM

## Abstract
A patch closure system for joining heat recoverable sheet material, especially for covering a substrate where the joined material is to be recovered around the sub strate, comprises a layer of adhesive on one surface, a part of which is a pressure sensitive adhesive and the remainder of which is a heat activatable adhesive. The pressure sensitive adhesive layer is of such an area and is placed such that, when the patch is placed over the overlap between the edges of the heat recoverable sheet material, the patch will continue to cover the overlap when the sheet material is recovered, even if the heat activatable adhesive layer has not been used to attach the patch to the sheet material.
