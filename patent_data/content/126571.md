# HEAT EXCHANGER

## Abstract
A heat exchanger has a heater 4, 5 for heating a heat car rying liquid 1 . The heated liquid 1 is pumped by pump 3 through a pipe 2 to a heat exchange section 6 , where the liquid 1 is brought into contact with a fluid to be heated by heat exchange with the liquid. The liquid 1 has a higher boiling point, a lower melting point, and a smaller specific heat than water. Such a liquid has the advantages that the loss of the liquid due to vaporizatiton is suppressed because of its high boiling point, that the liquid is unlikely to freeze because of its low melting point, and that the temperature rise of the ex changer is rapid and the heat exchange efficiency of exchanger is excellent because of the small specific heat of the liquid 1 . The heat exchanger is particularly suitable for heating systems.
