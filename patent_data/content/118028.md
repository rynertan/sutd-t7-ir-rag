## Description
SOLAR HEAT ACCUMULATING GREENHOUSES This invention relates to solar heat accumulating greenhouses. Conventionally, in greenhouses such as shown inJapanese Patent Kokai 54 91444, double roofs constructed with two glass panes, solar heat receiving panels arranged in the double roofs, a water storage tank storing hot water from the panels and an air conditioner using the hot water from the tank are provided. In another example as shown in JapaneseUtility Model Kokai 55 56570, a heat collector and a heat accumulating tank connected to the heat collector via a fan are provided. The former has the disadvantage that the double roof is necessary for arranging panels having wide heat receiving area near the roof of the greenhouse, and is thus costly to manufacture. In both of them only the air in the greenhouse is warmed, not the soil itself directly. According to the present invention there is provided a solar heat accumulating greenhouse having a heat accumulating tank which absorbs solar heat and accumulates or radiates it in accordance with temperature change to regulate the temperature of the greenhouse, characterised in that a radiator heat exchanging portion is provided at least at one side of an upper or lower portion in the greenhouse, and a heat accumulating tank is disposed at a lower part in the greenhouse, the radiator heat exchanging portion and the heat accumulating tank being connected to each other through a forced circulation liquid system. As will be described hereinafter, the heat accumulating tank is a heat insulating member, in which a container enclosing phase transformation heat accumulating medium therein is incorporated, and in this member there is formed a flow passage.To an upper portion at an upstream side of this flow passage, a heat collecting return pipe from a radiator heat collecting portion is connected. To a lower portion at a downstream side of this flow passage, a heat collecting supply pipe for the radiator heat collecting portion is coupled. It is so arranged that, during sun shining hours, solar heat is absorbed so as to be accumulated in the heat accumulating tank provided with the phase transformation substance, and the heat thus accumulated is discharged upon falling of the external atmospheric temperature. Therefore, the temperature within the greenhouse may be maintained at a predetermined constant level, with a consequent reduction of expense through saving of fuel cost. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic layout diagram showing a solar heat accumulating greenhouse, Figure 2 is a top plan view, partly broken away, of a.heat accumulating tank, Figure 3 is a front view, partly broken away, of the heat accumulating tank, and Figure 4 is a cross section taken along the lineIV IV in Figure 3. In Figure 1, generally at the central upper portion of the greenhouse 4A, there is provided a radiator heat collecting portion 4B which includes a radiator 4B1 provided with fins around a water passing pipe and having an air lead in port directed upward, and a fan 4B2 disposed below the radiator 4B1. There is also provided a radiator heat radiating section 4D having a construction similar to that of the radiator heat collecting portion 4B, and disposed with an air lead in portion of a radiator4D1 directed towards the side wall of the greenhouse, and a fan 4D2 directed towards the interior of the greenhouse. Further provided is a heat accumulating tank 4C which is a latent heat accumulating tank. As shown in Figures 2 through 4, the tank 4C includes a container 401 of a synthetic resin referred to as a tank body hereinbelow covered by a heat insulating material 404 such as expanded polystyrene or the like, a tank body cover 403 made of a corrosion resistance metal and further applied over the outer periphery of the tank body 401 covered with the heat insulating material 404, and a plurality of cylindrical containers 409 arranged in parallel relation to each other and incorporated in the tank body 401. In the cylindrical containers 409, a phase transformation heat accumulating medium which produces exothermic and endothermic reactions through temperature radiations is enclosed, while water is filled in the tank body 401 so as to be formed into streams.The interior of the tank body 401 is divided, for example, into a plurality of sections 461, 462 and 463 at its intermediate portion along long sides thereof in the horizontal direction, by a plurality of vertical partition plates 405. At the upstream side and downstream side along the water streams for these sections, the uppermost stream section 407 and the lowermost stream section 408 are formed. The cylindrical containers 409 are arranged along the direction of the long sides of the tank body 401 to extend through the partition plates 405, with the upper and lower stages fixed in a horizontal state in a zigzag manner. The partition plates 405 are each divided into upper and lower four sheets 451, 452, 453 and 454 holding the cylindrical containers 409 therebetween.The respective sections are in communication with each other through communicating pipes 410 which are open towards the lower portions of the upstream side sections through the partition walls 405, and also open towards the upper portions of the downstream side sections so as to form flow passages for producing uniform streams in the respective sections. To the uppermost stream section 407 there is connected at its upper part a heat collecting return pipe 412 from the radiator heat collecting section 4B. A heat radiating supply pipe 414b to the radiator heat radiating section 4D is connected at its lower portion. To the lowermost stream side section 408 are connected a heat collecting supply pipe 413 towards the radiator heat collecting section 4B and a heat radiating return pipe 414a from the radiator heat radiating section 4D. In each of the cylindrical containers 409, hydrated compound which produces exothermic and endothermic reactions by temperature variations, for example, CaCl2g6H2O is enclosed. When the temperature within the heat accumulating tank is raised by the hot water introduced from the radiator heat collect ing section 4B and reaches over 38 C, CaC12 6H20 2 2 becomes CaCl2 6H 20 to produce endothermic reaction for heat accumulation. Subsequently, upon falling of the water temperature below 380C, CaCl2 and water component are subjected to chemical combination to produce exothermic reaction, thereby to suppress lowering of water temperature within the tank.At the bottom portion within the tank 4C, a heat exchanging pipe 414 made of a good heat conducting metal is disposed in a zigzag manner so as to extend through each of the secitons, with the opposite ends thereof being respectively connected to the return pipe 414a and the supply pipe 414b. Water to be heated is passed through the heat exchanging pipe 414. A heat collecting forced circulation water system 4E is connected to the heat collecting return pipe 412 and heat collecting supply pipe 413 through the radiator heat collecting section 4B, and is provided with a circulating pump 4P1 at the supply pipe side. A heat radiating force circulation water supply 4F is connected to the heat radiating return pipe 414a and supply pipe 414b through the radiator heat collecting section 4D, and in the course at the side of the supply pipe 414b, a circulating pump 4P2 is connected. Part of the water pipe for the heat radiating force circulation water system 4F is buried in the ground within the greenhouse. In the heat accumulating greenhouse 4A having the construction as described above, operation is as follows. As shown in Figure 1, during day time with the sun shining, air within the greenhouse 4A is heated by the solar heat, and the air thus heated is drawn by the fan 4B2 of the radiator heat collecting section 4B to warm up the radiator 4B1 for heating water within the heat collecting forced circulating water system 4E. The water thus heated is fed to the heat collecting tank 4C for heat accumulation by the phase transformation heat accumulating medium in the cylindrical containers 409 within the tank 4C. Since the radiator heat collecting section 4B is positioned at the upper central portion where the room temperature is the highest, it has a high heat collecting efficiency. Meanwhile, during night time or rainy weather, when the temperature within the greenhouse falls following lowering of the external atmospheric temperature, heat is discharged into the greenhouse by heat from the heat accumulating tank 4C, contrary to the above case, for heating. The radiation of heat as described above is mainly effected by the radiator heat radiating section 4D, but it may be so modified as to effect the heat radiating function by supplementarily employing the radiator heat collecting portion 4B at the same time. Owing to the fact that the radiator heat radiating portion 4D has a high heat radiating efficiency, since it is disposed at the lower portion of the greenhouse for diffusing warm air towards the central portion, and also that part of the water piping for the heat radiation forced circulating water system 4F is buried in the ground, the ground surface and the interior of the greenhouse are heated also from underground. The heat collecting side circulating pump 4P1 and heat collecting section fan 4B2 or heat radiating side circulating pump 4P2 and heat radiating section fan 4D2 are respectively arranged to be automatically started or stopped as in sets by the functioning of a thermostat provided within the greenhouse. Upon falling of water temperature within the heat accumulating tank 4 below 380C due to heat radiation, the phase transformation heat accumulating medium in the cylindrical containers 409 causes exothermic reaction so as to prevent water temperature from falling further. The heat accumulating tank is capable of maintaining the temperature within the tank above the set value at all times, and has such effects that it is provided with a large thermal capacity, and can be made compact in size. For the phase transformation heat accumulating substance, Na2SO4glOH2O, Na2SO385H2O, and paraffin, for example, may be employed besides the substances described earlier. Moreover, in the heat collecting and heat radiating forced circulating fluid system referred to previously, anti freezing solution such as ethylene glycol, or fluids such as air, may be employed instead of water. Furthermore, in the heat accumulating tank 4C, spherical containers or containers of any other shapes may be accommodated instead of the cylindrical containers 409. It is also to be noted that the heat radiating section 4D may be omitted so as to effect the heat radiating function by the heat collecting section 4B, and that, with the heat collecting section 4B abbreviated, warm air at the ceiling portion is led to the heat radiating section 4D through a duct for effecting the heat collecting function also thereat.
