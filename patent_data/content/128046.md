The polymerization at that temperature obtains polypropylene having a bimodal molecular weight distribution. It is also known to produce polymer blends by polymerizing two or more polymerizable materials in two or more reactors arranged in series. In accordance with such methods, a polymerizate is produced in a first reactor which first polymerizate is passed to a second reactor wherein a second polymerizate is produced thereby obtaining a blend of the first and second polymerizates. It is highly desirable to be able to readily and simply produce blends in a single reactor during which polyethylene and copolyethylene alpha olefins are produced simultaneously.Not only is a significant reduction in energy costs obtained, but one obtains a uniform blending of the polymers and one can simply tailor the polymers with respect to molecular weights, weight fraction and the like to obtain blends evidencing outstanding properties. In view of the foregoing problems, it would be highly desirable to provide a polymerization catalyst system of sufficient activity to produce high quality blends of ethylene alpha olefin polymers. It is furthermore highly desirable to be able to produce the blends of ethylene alpha olefin polymers directly in a single reactor. The present invention provides a process for producing co polyolefin reactor blends comprising polyethylene and copolyethyl ene al pha ol efi ns. The reactor blends are obtained directly during a single polymerization process, i.e., the blends of this invention are obtained in a single reactor by simultaneously polymerizing ethylene and copolymerizing ethylene with an alpha olefin thereby eliminating expensive blending operations. The invention furthermore provldes a catalyst system for the polymerization of ethylene and ethylene copolymers simultaneously to provide polyethylene blends.The process of producing reactor blends in accordance with this invention can be employed in conjunction with other prior art blending techniques, for example the reactor blends produced in a first reactor can be subjected to further blending in a second stage by use of a series of reactors. Accordingly, there is provided a catalyst system for the polymerization of reactor blends of polyethylene with ethylene alpha olefin copolymers said catalyst system comprising a at least two different metallocenes and b an alumoxane. The metallocenes employed in this invention are organometallic coordination compounds which are cyclopentadienyl derivatives of a transition metal of Groups 4b, Sb and 6b and include mono, di and tricyclopentadienyls and their derivatives of the transition metal.The metallocenes can be represented by the general formula C5Rm pRs C5Rm MeQ3 p or Rs C5Rm MeQ , wherein C5R11 is a cyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl, each R , which can be the same or different, is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical such as alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkylaryl, or arylalkyl radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or two R sukstituents together form a fusedC4 C6 ring, RZ is a C1 C4 alkylene radical, a dialkyl germanium or silicone, or an alkyl phosphine or amine radical bridging two C5R11 rings, Q is a hydrocarbon radical such as aryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkylaryl, or arylalkyl radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or halogen and each q can be the same or different, Q is an alkylidene radical having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, Me is a transition metal of Group 4b, 5b, 6b of the Periodic Table Chemical Rubber Company s Handbook ofChemistry A Physics, 48th Edition , s is Oor 1, p is 0, 1 or 2 when p 0, s 0 m is 4 when s is 1 and m is 5 when s is 0. The ratios of one metallocene to the second metallocene will be a function of both the chemical composition of the metallocenes as well as the blend being tailored accordingly, the ratio of the two metallocenes can vary greatly and, hence, is limited only for the purpose of producing the blends. The present invention also provides a process for producing polyolefin reactor blends. The process comprises polymerizing ethylene and higher alpha olefins in the presence of the catalyst system described above. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed towards a catalytic process for the polymerization of ethylene and one or more alpha olefins to polyethylene copolyethylene alpha olefin reactor blends. The polymers are intended for fabrication into articles by extrusion, injection molding, thermoforming, rotational molding, and the like. In particular, the polymer blends of this invention are blends of polyethylenes such as high density polyethylene HDPE and linear low density polyethylene LLDPE and with copolyethylene higher alpha olefins having from 3 to about 10 carbon atoms and preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms. Illustrative of the higher aipha olefins are propylene, butene l, hexene l and octene l. Preferably, the alpha olefin is propylene or butene 1. In the process of the present invention, ethylene, together with the alpha olefins, is polymerized in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst system comprising at least two different metallocenes and an alumoxane. The alumoxanes are well known in the art and are polymeric aluminum compounds which can be represented by the general formulae R Al O n which Is a cyclic compound and R R Al O nAlR2, which is a linear compound. In the general formula R is a C1 C6 alkyl group such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and pentyl and n is an integer from 1 to about 20 and preferably from about 1 to about 4. Most preferably, R is methyl and n is 4. Generally, 5n the preparation of alumoxanes from, for example, aluminum trimethyl and water, a mixture of the linear and cyclic compounds are obtained. The alumoxane can be prepared in various ways. Preferably, they are prepared by contacting water with solution of aluminum trialkyl, such as, for example, aluminum trimethyl, in a suitable organic solvent such as benzene or an aliphatic hydrocarbon. For example, the aluminum alkyl is treated with water in form of a moist solvent or the aluminum alkyl such as aluminum trimethyl can be desirably contacted with a hydrated salt such as hydrated copper sulfate. Preferably, the alumoxane is prepared in the presence of a hydrated copper sulfate. The method comprises treating a dilute solution of aluminum trimethyl in, for example, toluene, with copper sulfate represented by the general formula CuS04051120. The ratio of copper sulfate to aluminum trimethyl is desirably about 1 mole of copper sulfate for 5 moles of aluminum trimethyl. The reaction is evidenced by the evolution of methane. The dual metallocene system usefully employed in accordance with this invention are the mono, di and tricyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl metallocenes and preferably the titanium IV and zirconium IV metallocenes. The metallocenes are represented by the general formula C5Rm pRs C5Rm MeQ3 p andRs C5Rm 2MeQ wherein CsR is cyclopentadienyl or substituted cyclopentadienyl, each R is the same or different and is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical such as alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkylaryl, or arylalkyl radicals containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or two carbon atoms are joined together to form a C4 C6 ring, R is a C1 C4 alkylene radical, a dialkyl germanium or silicone, or an alkyl phosphine or amine radical bridging two C5Rm rings, Q is a hydrocarbyl radical such as aryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkylaryl, or arylalkyl radical having from 1 20 carbon atoms or halogen and can be the same or different, Q is an alkylidene radical having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, s is O or 1, p is O, 1 or 2 when p is 0, s is 0, 1 is 4 when s is 1 and 1 is 3 when s is o and Me is a Group 4b, 5b or 6b transition metal and most preferably zirconium or titanium. Exemplary hydrocarbyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl, isoamyl, hexyl, isobutyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, cetyl, 2 ethylhexyl, phenyl, and the like. Exemplary alkylene radicals are methylene, ethylene, propylene, and the like. Preferred examples of substituent Q are methyl, phenyl or chloride. Exemplary halogen atoms include chlorine, bromine and iodine and of these halogen atoms, chlorine is preferred. Exemplary of the alkylidene radicals are methylidene, ethylidene and propylidene. Preferably the catalyst comprises at least two zirconocenes or at least one titanocene and at least one zirconocene. Illustrative but non limiting examples of the titanocenes which can be usefully employed in accordance with this invention are bis cyclopentadienyl titanium diphenyl the carbene tepresented by the formula Cp2Ti CH2 Al CH3 2Cl, and derivatives of this reagent such as Cp2Ti CH2 Al CH3 3, Cp2TiCH2 2, Cp2TiCH2CH CH3 CH2,Cp2Ti CHCH2CH2, Cp2Ti CH2 AIR2 Cl, wherein Cp is a cyclopentadienyl or substituted cylopentadienyl radical, and R is an alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl radical having from 1 18 carbon atoms substituted bis Cp Ti IV compounds such as bis lndenyl Ti diphenyl or dichloride, bls methylcyclopentadienyl Ti diphenyl or dihalides and other dihalide complexes dialkyl, trialkyl, tetra alkyl and penta alkyl cyclopentadienyl titanium compounds such as bis 1,2 dimethylcyclopentadienyl Ti diphenyl or dichloride, bis fluorenyl Ti dichloride, bis 1,2 diethylcyclopentadienyl Ti diphenyl or dichloride and other dihalide complexes silicone, phosphine, amine or carbon bridged cyclopentadiene complexes, such as dimethyl silyl dicyclopentadienyl titanium diphenyl or dichloride, methyl phosphine dicyclopentadienyl titanium di phenyl or dichl ori de, methyl enedicycl opentadienyl titanium diphenyl or dichloride and other dihalide complexes. Illustrative but non limiting examples of the zirconocenes which can be usefully employed in accordance with this invention are bis cyclopentadienyl zirconium diphenyl, bis cyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl the alkyl substituted cyclopentadienes, such as his ethyl cycl opentadienyl zirconiu dimethyl, bis ss phenlypropylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl, bis methylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl and dihalide complexes of the above di alkyl, tri alkyl, tetra alkyl, and penta alkyl cyclopentadienes, such as bis pentamethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl, bis t,2 dimethylcyclopentadienyllzircanitrm dimethyl, bis 1,3 diethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl and dihalide complexes of the above silicone, phosphorus, and carbon bridged cyclopentadiene complexes such as dimethyl silyl di cyci opentadienyl zirconium dimethyl or dihalide, methylphosphine dicyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl or dihalide, and methylene dicyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl or dihalide, carbenes represented by the formulae Cp2Zr CH2P C6115 2CH3, and derivatives of these compounds such asEMI8.1 The ratio of aluminum in the alumoxane to total metal in the metallocenes can be in the range of 0.5 1 to 105 1, and preferably 5 1 to 1000 1. The molar ratio of the metallocenes can vary over a wide range and in accordance with this invention the molar ratios are controlled by the product polymer blend desired. The reactivity ratios of the metallocenes in general are obtained by methods well known such as, for example, as described in Linear Method for Determining Monomer ReactivityRatios in CopolymerRzation , M. Fineman and S. D. Ross, J.Polymer Science 5, 259 1950 or Copolymerization , F. R. Mayo and C. Walling, Chem. Rev. 46, 191 1950 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. For example, to determine reactivity ratios the most widely used copolymerization model is based on the following equations k11 M1 M1 M1 1 k12 Mi M2 k12 M2 2 k21 M2 M1 M1 3 K22 M2 M2 k22 M2 4 where M refers to a monomer molecule which is arbitrarily designated i where r 1, 2 and M2 refers to a growing polymer chain to which monomer 1 has most recently attached. The kij values are the rate constants for the indicated reactions. Thus, k11 represents the rate at which an ethylene unit inserts into a growing polymer chain in which the previously inserted monomer unit was also ethylene. The reactivity rates follow as r1 k11 k12 and k22 k21 wherein kil, kl2, k22 and k21 are the rate constants for ethylene 1 or propylene 2 addition two a catalyst site where the last polymerized monomer is an ethylene kit or propylene k2X . In Table I the ethylene propylene reactivity rates rl and r2 are listed for several metallocenes. It can be seen that with increased steric interaction at the monomer coordination site rl increases, i.e. the tendency for ethylene polymerization increases over propylene polymerization. It can be seen from Table I that if one desires a blend comprising HDPE ethylene propylene copolymer one would select bis pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ZrCl2 and bis cyclopentadienyl Ti diphenyl or dimethyl silyl di cycl opentadienyl zirconium dichloride in ratios of 5 1 to 1 1 whereas if one desires a blend comprising LLDPE ethylene propylene one would select bis cyclopentadienyl Zr dimethyl or bis methylcyclopentadienyl ZrCl2 and bis cyclopentadienyl Ti diphenyl or dimethylsilyldicyclopentadienyl ZrC12 in ratios of 10 1 to l l. Desirably, the metallocene molar ratio will be 100 1 to 1 100, and preferably 10 1 to 1 10. The specific metallocenes selected and their molar ratios are depended upon the molecular composition desired for the component polymers and the overall composition desired for the blend. In general, the component catalyst used in a reactor blend catalyst mixture will each have r values which are different in order to produce final polymer compositions which comprise blends of two or more polymer.

Such solvents are well known and include, for example, isobutane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, toluene, xylene and the like. The catalyst systems described herein are suitable for producing polymer product blends in solution, slurry or a gas phase polymerizations and over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. For example, such temperatures may be in the range of 60 to 280 C and especially in the range of 50 to 160 OC The pressures employed in the process of the present invention are those well known for example, in the range of 1 to 500 atmospheres and greater. In a solution phase polymerization the alumoxane and metallocene can be employed as a homogeneous catalyst system.The alumoxane is preferably dissolved in a suitable solvent, typically in inert hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, xylene, and the like in molar concentations of 0.1 to 3.0, however greater or lesser amounts tan be employed. The soluble metallocenes can be converted to supported heterogeneous catalyst by depositing said metallocenes on typical catalyst supports such as, for example, silica, alumina, and polyethylene. The solid catalysts in combination with an alumoxane can be usefully employed in slurry and gas phase olefin polymerizations. After polymerization and deactivation of the catalyst, the product polymer blend can be recovered by processes well known in the art for removal of deactivated catalysts and solution.The solvents may be flashed off from the polymer solution and the polymer obtained extruded into water and cut into pellets or other suitable comminuted shapes. Pigments, antioxidants and other additives, as is known in the art, may be added to the polymer. The polymer product obtained in accordance with this invention will have a weight average molecular weight in the range of 500 to 2,000,b00 and preferably 10,000 to 500,000. The component polymers in the reactor blend can have the same or different average molecular weights and comonomer composition however, it is preferable for most end uses that the average molecular weights and comonomer composition be different. Illustrative, but nonlimiting examples of reactor blends which can be produced in accordance with this invention areHDPE EPR copolymer, LLDPE EPR copolymer, HDPE LLDPE andHDPE LLDPE EPR copolymer blends. These polymers demonstrate superior properties such as for example impact resistance and tear strength and process more easily than the individual component polymers. The polymers produced by the process of this present invention are capable of being fabricated into a wide variety of articles, as is known for blend of ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and higher alpha olefins.
