# Process for producing zirconium oxide sintered body.

## Abstract
A zirconium oxide sintered body for an oxygen concen tration sensor is produced by mixing 87.5 to 91.0 by weight of zirconium oxide powder, 8.5 to 12.3 by weight of yttrium oxide powder, 0.5 by weight or less of silicon oxide and 0.2 to 1.0 by weight of aluminium oxide, drying the resulting mixture, followed by sintering so as to make the cubic phase content in crystal phase of the resulting sintered body at ordinary temperatures 95 by weight or more. Such zirco nium oxide sintered bodies have excellent mechanical strength, ionic conductivity and thermal shock properties and can be used stably for a long period of time.
