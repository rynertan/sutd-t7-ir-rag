# CHARACTER KEYBOARDS

## Abstract
A keyboard suitable for a typewriter, word processor, computer terminal and the like consists of an array of keys corresponding to the characters of an alphabet arranged in distinct adjacent zones 11 to 19 . The zones 11 to 19 may be delineated by boundaries 21, 22 or 30 or may be intrinsically defined by the nature of the characters they contain. The zones 11 to 19 are arranged in rows. The vowel characters of the alphabet are located in one or more adjacent zones 15 which are not in the top or bottom rows and which do not ex tend to either lateral extreme of the array. Peripheral characters or keys are preferably larger than central characters or keys and the characters in each zone, in the top row and in the bottom row are preferably alphabetically related. The keyboard is faster to use than a Qwerty layout for an untrained operator and results in fewer errors, and touch typ ing is faster to learn on the keyboard.
