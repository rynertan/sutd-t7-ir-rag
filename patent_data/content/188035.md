# ELECTROHYDRAULIC DRIVE FOR PROCESS LINE WINDERS, UNWINDERS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
A hydraulic cylinder 106 controls linear traversing movement of a spooler 16 under the control of a high speed servo valve 136 that in turn is controlled by electronic circuitry. Position, velocity and rotation speed transducers 106, 114 and 116 for the spooler and a position transducer 118 for a strand 18 being wound onto or unwound from the spool provide input signals to the circuitry.
