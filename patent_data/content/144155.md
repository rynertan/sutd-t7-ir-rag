# Agent for forming surface protecting layer on coated paper.

## Abstract
An agent for forming a surface protecting layer on a coated paper, which comprises an aqueous solution of an alkali metal salt, ammonium salt or amine salt of a graft copolymer and an epoxy group containing cross linking agent incorporated in the aqueous solution, said graft copolymer comprising A 10 to 60 by weight of a polyvinyl alcohol polymer selected from the group consisting of partially saponified polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohols containing copolymerized units of a vinyl monomer having carboxyl group, and polyvinyl alcohol having the recurring vinyl alcohol units esterified with a higher fatty acid, B 20 to 70 by weight of acrylamide or methacrylamide, C 5 to 30 by weight of at least one member selected from the group, consisting of acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, lower alkyl esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid and hydroxyl lower alkyl esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, and D 5 to 20 by weight of at least one vinyl monomer containing a carboxyl group.
