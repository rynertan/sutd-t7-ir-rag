# Light source unit for an optical apparatus.

## Abstract
A light source unit for an endoscope is provided with a light emitting element 46 and a light receiving element 48 which are provided in an eyepiece section of an endoscope 6 . The light emitting element 46 is supplied with current modified by a specific frequency from an oscillating circuit 51 and produces a light intensity modulated light. An output signal from the light receiving element 48 is supplied to a filter circuit 53 and a signal of the specific frequency component is taken out from the filter circuit to be compared with a reference voltage in a Schmidt circuit 36 . When an operator approaches to the light receiving element 48 and enters a range within a predetermined distance from the light receiving element 48 , a light intensity of the light which is emitted from the light emitting element 46 toward the operator, reflected from the operator, and is incident on the light receiving element 48 , becomes large. As a result, a signal level supplied to the Schmidt circuit 36 exceeds a predetermined value. At this time, a signal for turning on a light source is produced from the Schmidt circuit 36 to energize a relay 44 and to close a contact 42 of the relay. Then, electric power is supplied from a power source 40 to the light source 14 to turn on the light source 14 . As a result, an illuminating light is supplied from the light source 14 to a light guide of the endoscope, whereby an area of an objective portion can be observed through an image guide of the endoscope.
