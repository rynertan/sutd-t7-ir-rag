## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor superlattice structure which is applicable to a light emitting device. A light emitting device using a III V compound semiconductor has been developed and has achieved emissions in the visible red to infrared wavelength range. The prerequisite for a light emitting material is that the energy gap Eg specific to the material is of a direct transition type. Where such a material is used to constitute an active emission layer of a light emitting diode, semiconductor laser or like device, there can be accomplished emissions With a wavelength λ A light emitting device of the kind providing an active layer as described above will hereinafter be referred to as an ordinary type light emitting device. In this case, the value which can be selected as the shortest emission wavelength is dependent on the largest one of direct transition type energy gaps, or direct energy gaps, Eg. So far as III V compound semiconductors are concerned, the largest direct energy gap Eg is 2.3 electron volts which is the energy gap of Al Meanwhile, from the application standpoint, a light emitting element lying in a shorter wavelength range, i.e., blue green to green range, is desired. However, meeting such a desire by use of a III V compound is generally considered difficult for the previously stated reason. A light emitting material which emits in the blue green to green range may be implemented by ZnSe or like II VI compound semiconductor. Nevertheless, such has also been impracticable because many of constituent elements of a II VI compound semiconductor, compared to those of a III V compound semiconductor, have high vapor pressures so that reduction of lattice defects which are introduced during the course of crystal growth is far difficult in a II VI compound semiconductor than in a III V compound semiconductor. In this regard, shortening the emission wavelength using a III V compound semiconductor whose lattice defects are relatively easy to control would be an invaluable contribution to the art. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor structure which eases the limitations on the shortest emission wavelength in relation to the use of the previously discussed III V compound semiconductor as an active layer of a light emitting element and, thereby, makes a visible light emitting element having an emission wavelength λ The present invention is derived from the fact that, even if mixed crystal compound semiconductors which constitute the respective layers of a semiconductor superlattice structure or a binary compound have an indirect energy gap or even if a mixed crystal compound semiconductor provided by replacing a superlattice structure with a mixed crystal, which corresponds to an average composition of one period, has an indirect energy gap, the energy gap of the semiconductor superlattice structure is capable of directly turning into a direct transition type due to the periodic structure A. Madhukar, J Vac. Sci. Technol. A uniform Al Hence, if provided with a superperiod structure in the 100 direction, even Al Referring to FIG. 1 of the drawings, a superlattice structure in accordance with the present invention is shown and generally designated by the reference numeral 200. The superlattice structure 200 is provided on a GaAs substrate 1 and made up of at least several tens to several hundreds of unit structures 50 which are sequentially laminated in the 100 direction of the GaAs substrate 1. Each of the unit structures 50 defines one period and comprises an InP single atomic layer 21, an AlP single atomic layer 31, an InP single atomic layer 22, a GaP single atomic layer 40, an InP single atomic layer 23, and an AlP single atomic layer 32. Since each of these layers in the unit structure 50 is sufficiently thin, distortions due to mismatching of lattice constants within the superlattice is not so significant as to introduce crystal lattice defects. Concerning an average composition, the superlattice structure corresponds to Al The above described order of laminated semiconductor layers which constitute a unit structure is not restrictive. Specifically, while the order in the illustrative embodiment is InP AlP InP GaP InP AlP, it may alternatively be InP InP InP AlP AlP GaP or InP InP GaP InP AlP AlP. In any of the alternative cases, where the conjugate layers comprise the same compound such as the InP layers or AlP layers, the sum of their thicknesses should preferably be maintained at ten atomic layers or less. Further, each of the layers in the unit structure may be selected within the range of one to ten atomic layers, instead of a single atomic layer shown and described. Since the energy gap of a superlattice structure is substantially determined by an average composition, it is possible to attain any desired bandgap by controlling the thickness of each layer. Whatever order may be selected for the layers in the unit structure, the indirect to direct energy gap transformation effect is utilized. Referring to FIG. 2, a semiconductor laser to which the superlattice structure of the present invention is applied is shown. The semiconductor laser comprises an n GaAs substrate 2, and a cladding layer 6, an active layer 5 having a superlattice structure and a cladding layer 7 which are sequentially provided on the substrate 2 by molecular beam epitaxy. An n type electrode 10 is provided on the substrate 2 and a p type electrode 11 on the cladding layer 7. The active layer 5 having the superlattice shown in FIG. 1 has a total thickness of about 0.1 µm micron and an average composition which corresponds to Al In summary, it will be seen that in accordance with the present invention a light emitting diode, semiconductor laser or like light emitting element whose emission wavelength is as short as 560 nanometers or less can be implemented only with a III V compound semiconductor by using, as an active layer of the light emitting element, a semiconductor superlattice structure which is made up of an AlP layer, a GaP layer and an InP layer each being one to ten atomic layers thick.
