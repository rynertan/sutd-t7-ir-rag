# LUBRICANT SEAL FOR TRACK LINKAGE

## Abstract
Where successive track links are connected together, each of a pair of first links has a radial end wall with an annular recess. A cylindrical tubular pin is firmly press fitted into cylindrical openings through each first link. Into each of a pair of second links is press fitted an annular bushing that surrounds the pin with clearance. An elas tomeric annular lubricant sealing member is retained in each annular recess in a leak tight fit. Each sealing member has an end face with an outer radial portion substantially in the same plane as the first links radial end wall and has a radially inner portion, providing a lip which, before installa tion, has an edge lying axially beyond the plane of that radial end wall, and which, after installation, is in rotary sealing engagement with a radial wall of the bushing and is pushed approximately to the plane of the radial end wall. Each lip also has an innermost portion which, before in stallation, is larger in diameter than the pin, but on installa ton is swung inwardly and is forced firmly into contact with the pin to form a static seal therewith.
