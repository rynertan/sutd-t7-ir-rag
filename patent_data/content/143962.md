# Process for removing aluminum and silica from alkali metal halide brine solutions.

## Abstract
A process for removing dissolved aluminum and silica contaminants from concentrated alkali metal halide brines used in membrane electrolytic cells is disclosed. The process involves contacting an acidified brine at a pH of between about 2.0 and about 3.0 with a strong macroreticular cationic chelating resin.
