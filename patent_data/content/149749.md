# Current threshold detector.

## Abstract
A circuit 10 for detecting a very large output current threshold with respect to a low reference current. The threshold detector circuit inciudes a multiple transistor circuit 16, 18 wherein a pair of emitter areas are ratioed with respect to each other, and which have common bases, and an error amplifier 26, 28, 32, 34 the inputs of which are connected to the respective emitters of the multiple transis tor circuit. An output current is sourced from the emitter of the multiple transistor circuit 16, 18 having the larger area which output current is a function of the load coupled therewith to thereby produce a voltage at this emitter the magnitude thereof being a function of the output current. The current sourced from the other emitter of the multiple a transistor circuit 16, 18 to the additional input of the error amplifier 26, 28, 32, 34 is proportional to the bias current IREF sourced therefrom by the error amplifier whereby the error amplifier 26, 28, 32, 34 effectfully monitors the emitter voltages of the multiple transistor circuit 16, 18 to provide an error signal the sense of which switches as the output load current varies above and below a threshold value that is a function of the magnitude of the reference current.
