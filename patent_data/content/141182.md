# PROCESS AND MEDIUM FOR CULTURING ANT VENOM GLAND CELLS

## Abstract
In vitro culture of the venom gland cells of Pseudomyremex triplarinus is effected by removing venom gland tissue from a larva or pupa of P. triplarinus subjecting the tissue to a protease to separate out the cells therein and culturing the resultant cells in an isotonic salin medium com prising carbohydrate, amino acids guanosine 3 ,5 cyclic monophosphate and adenosine 3 ,5 cyclic monophosphoric acid, at least part of the medium having been conditioned with Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Such in vitro culture provides a practicable route to volume production of the biologically active materials which are useful for treating the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and which the venom gland cells are known to produce.
