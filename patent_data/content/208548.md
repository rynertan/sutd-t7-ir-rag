## Description
This invention relates to YIG Yttrium Iron Garnet thin film microwave apparatus, and in particular to such apparatus including a YIG thin film device utilising the ferrimagnetic resonance effect. There has been proposed microwave apparatus, such as a microwave filter or a microwave oscillator, which utilises the ferrimagnetic resonance of a YIG thin film as a ferrimagnetic material formed on a GGG Gadolinium Gallium Garnet non magnetic substrate by means of liquid phase epitaxial growth which will be hereinafter referred to as LPE and worked into a desired shape, such as a circular or rectangular shape, by selective etching with a photolithographic technique. The microwave apparatus makes it possible to form a microwave integrated circuit with a transmission line such as a micro strip line, and easily effect hybrid connection with another microwave integrated circuit. Furthermore, since microwave apparatus utilising magnetic resonance of the YIG thin film may be prepared by the LPE and the photolithography techniques as mentioned above, mass productivity can readily be achieved. Such microwave apparatus has been proposed in 1985 IEEE MIT S INTERNATIONAL MICROWAVE SYMPOSIUM DIGEST, saint Louis, Missouri, 4 6 June 1985, pages 285 288, IEEE, New York, USA, Y. MURAKAMI et.al A bandpass filter using YIG film grown by LPE. For the above reasons, microwave apparatus utilising the magnetic resonance of the YIG thin film has practical advantages over conventional magnetic resonance devices using a YIG sphere. However, in microwave apparatus utilising ferrimagnetic resonance of the YIG thin film, the ferrimagnetic resonance frequency f of the YIG thin film is largely dependent upon the temperature T. Therefore, there arises a significant problem in practical use, namely that the temperature characteristics are not satisfactory. Such a problem will now be described. The ferrimagnetic resonance frequency f of the YIG thin film may be expressed in the following manner by using Kittel s equation, provided that an anisotropic field contribution to the resonance frequency is small enough to be neglected. In order to avoid deviation in the resonance frequency due to environmental temperature in the YIG thin film microwave apparatus, there has been proposed a method for maintaining the YIG thin film magnetic resonance device at a constant temperature by placing the device in a thermostatic chamber, or alternatively a method for maintaining the resonance frequency of the device constant by changing a magnetic field in dependence on temperature by means of an electromagnet. However, these methods necessitate an external energy supply means such as a current controller, thereby making construction complicated. According to the present invention there is provided YIG thin film microwave apparatus comprising a YIG thin film device utilising the ferrimagnetic resonance effect, and a magnetic circuit having a gap of length ℓg in which said YIG thin film device is disposed and applying a bias magnetic field perpendicular to a film surface of said YIG thin film device, said magnetic circuit including a permanent magnet having a thickness ℓm end a soft magnetic plate having a thickness ℓx, characterised by said permanent magnet satisfying the characteristics and said soft magnetic plate satisfying the characteristics wherein fo is the resonance frequency of said YIG thin film device A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a YIG thin film microwave apparatus which does not require an external circuit for compensating for the temperature characteristics, thereby involving no further power consumption for compensating for the temperature characteristics. The apparatus is capable of carrying out compensation of the temperature characteristics over a wide frequency range. The preferred YIG thin film microwave apparatus may be used either at a fixed frequency or at a variable frequency. According to another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a microwave apparatus of the above construction in which the YIG thin film is formed of substituted YIG material, where the trivalent iron ion Fe³ in the YIG is partially substituted with a non magnetic ion. Thus temperature compensation can be achieved by selecting the thickness of the permanent magnet ℓm, the thickness of the soft magnetic plate ℓx and the substituted amount δ expressed as a formula unit. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, throughout which like parts are referred to by like references, and in which Referring to Figure 1 which shows a YIG thin film microwave apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention, a YIG thin film microwave device 1 includes strip lines not shown electromagnetically coupled to the YIG thin film, and a magnetic circuit 2 is arranged to apply a bias magnetic field to the microwave device 1. In one example, the magnetic circuit 2 comprises a U shaped yoke 3, permanent magnets 4 each having a thickness ℓm and soft magnetic plates 5, for example made of soft ferrite, and each having a thickness ℓx. The permanent magnets 4 and the soft magnetic plates 5 are arranged on opposed surfaces at both end portions of the yoke 3 to define a magnetic gap g having a spacing of ℓg between the soft magnetic plates 5. The microwave device 1 is located in the magnetic gap g. In the magnetic circuit shown in Figure 1, supposing that all the magnetic flux passes through the magnetic gap g, the magnetic field in the gap g is uniform, and the permeability of the yoke is infinite, the following equations are derived from Maxwell s equations. Supposing that the permanent magnet 4 does not have a knee point, and the recoil permeability of the permanent magnet 4 is constant, that is its demagnetisation curve shows linearity, the following Equation 4 is satisfied. In consideration of the temperature coefficients α₁ Substituting Equations 7 , 8 and 9 into Equation 10 , and equating each term of the Oth, 1st and 2nd orders with respect to the temperature T, the following equations can be obtained. It is appreciated from Equations 14 and 15 that the following conditions must be established so as to let ℓm and ℓx have a positive solution. Since Nz 1 in Expression 17 , it is appreciated that Expression 17 always holds if the following condition is established. In the structure shown in Figure 1, the soft magnetic plate 5 is formed of Mg Mn Al ferrite having temperature characteristics as shown in Figure 2, and the permanent magnet 4 is formed of any one of Nd₂Fe₁₄B magnet having Br 11000 G, α₁ The thicknesses ℓx and ℓm and frequency deviation Δ f in consideration of the 2nd order coefficient in the temperature range of 20 In the above, the gap spacing ℓg was set to 3mm, and 4πMso Figure 3 shows temperature characteristics against the resonance frequency of YIG in the case that the magnetic circuit 2 is formed by the combination of the Mg Mn Al soft ferrite plate 5 and the Nd₂Fe₁₄B magnet 4. As is apparent from Figure 3, the frequency variation Δf falls within a range of 2.9 MHz with respect to a centre frequency of 1.575 GHz in the temperature range of 20 Although the magnetic circuit 2 is constituted of one kind of permanent magnet 4 and one kind of soft ferrite plate 5 in the aforementioned embodiment, two kinds of magnet and one kind of soft ferrite plate may instead be combined to form the magnetic circuit. Figure 4 shows a magnetic circuit 2 formed by combining two kinds of permanent magnet 4a and 4b with the soft ferrite plate 5. In this case, the following equation 21 corresponding to Equation 6 is derived. Where, Br₁ and Br₂ are the remanences of the permanent magnets 4a and 4b, respectively µr₁ and µr₂ are the recoil permeabilities of the permanent magnets 4a and 4b, respectively and ℓm₁ and ℓm₂ are the total thicknesses of the permanent magnets 4a and 4b, respectively. Representing the sum of the respective thicknesses of the permanent magnets 4a and 4b by ℓm Representing an average remanence of the permanent magnets 4a and 4b by Br T , the following equation can be obtained. Substituting the following equations into Equation 24 , Representing a ratio of the thickness of the permanent magnets 4a and 4b by a ℓm₁ ℓm₂, a ratio of the recoil permeabilities of the permanent magnets 4a and 4b by b µr₁ µr₂, and a ratio of the remanences of the permanent magnets 4a and 4b at room temperature by c Br₁ Defining each parameter as mentioned above, Equation 21 can be expressed in the same form as Equation 6 as follows Deriving from Equation 27 , the following Expressions 28 and 29 corresponding to Expressions 16 and 18 can be obtained. In summary, provided that the ratios a, b and c are defined by a ℓm₁ ℓm₂, b µr₁ µr₂, and c Br₁ As is mentioned above, the use of the soft ferrite plate in combination with the two kinds of permanent magnets 4a and 4b is more advantageous than the case of using only two kinds of permanent magnets 4a and 4b. In the case that two kinds of permanent magnets only are used, the remanence Br of the permanent magnets varies to a relatively significant extent, and it is difficult to cut the magnets after being magnetised. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the gap spacing finally, so as to let the resonance frequency of the YIG thin film accord with a required frequency. However, if the gap spacing ℓg is different from the set value, the temperature characteristics are disadvantageously changed. On the other hand, in the case that a soft ferrite plate is used in combination with the permanent magnets, the temperature characteristics are so adjusted as to accord substantially with an objective or required value by the soft ferrite plate, while the slippage or variation of the temperature characteristics generated by the adjustment of the gap spacing due to variation in the remanence of the permanent magnets may be finally finely adjusted by the soft ferrite plate. Namely, the resonance frequency and the temperature characteristics may be simultaneously brought into accordance with the require or objective value. Figure 5 shows a magnetic circuit 2 using one kind of permanent magnet 4 and two kinds of first and second soft ferrite plates 5a and 5b formed of different materials. In this case, the following Equation 30 corresponding to Equation 6 can be derived. Where 4πMs Representing the sum of respective thicknesses of the soft ferrite plates 5a and 5b by ℓx Therefore, the following equation is obtained. Substituting the following equations into Equation 32 , and comparing each term of the 0th, 1st and 2nd orders with respect to the temperature on both sides, the following equations can be obtained. Representing a ratio of the thicknesses of the soft ferrite plates 5a and 5b by a ℓx₁ ℓx₂, a ratio of the demagnetisation factors of the soft ferritc plates 5a and 5b by b Nz Defining each parameter as mentioned above, Equation 34 can be expressed in the same form as Equation 6 as follows Deriving from Equation 35 , the following Expressions 36 and 37 corresponding to Expressions 17 and 18 can be obtained. In summary, provided that the ratios a, b and c are defined by a ℓx₁ ℓx₂, b Nz Although the present invention has been described as applied to a microwave apparatus using a fixed frequency in the above embodiment, it may be applied to a variable type YIG thin film microwave apparatus including a coil not shown wound around the yoke 3 in the magnetic circuit 2. As is described above, a gradient in the temperature characteristics of the resonance frequency can be nullified by determining ℓm and ℓx satisfying Equations 11 and 12 . However, a curvature of the temperature characteristics cannot be compensated by these conditions only. That is to say, as shown in Figure 1, the magnetic circuit of the YIG thin film microwave apparatus having a centre frequency of 1.575 GHz is formed by using Mg Mn Al ferrite having the temperature characteristics shown in Figure 2 as the soft magnetic plate 5 and Nd₂Fe₁₄B magnet as the permanent magnet 4. As to variation in the centre frequency in the temperature range of 55 In connection with the arrangement shown in Figure 1, the microwave device 1 is formed by a substitution type YIG thin film, for example a thin film formed by substituting a trivalent non magnetic ion such as Ga³ and Al³ for a part of Fe³ of the YIG, or by combining divalent and tetravalent non magnetic ions Ca² and Ge⁴ to equivalently substitute a trivalent ion for Fe³ of the YIG. A change in saturation magnetisation of the substitution type YIG, that is, a change in saturation magnetisation due to substitution of the non magnetic ion for Fe³ ion of the YIG will now be investigated. Firstly, the change compared to a pure single crystal of YIG will be investigated. In the pure single crystal of YIG Y₃Fe₅O₁₂ , three Fe³ ions are located at the tetrahedral site, and two Fe³ ions are located at the octahedral site. The Fe³ ions at the tetrahedral site and the Fe³ ions at the octahedral site are arranged in antiparallel relation with each other by strong negative superexchange interaction. As a result, the saturation magnetisation of YIG is depedent on a magnetic moment of 5 Bohr magneton 5µB owned by one Fe³ ion remaining as the result of balance of the five Fe³ ions in the antiparallel arrangement. In the case that a trivalent ion, for example Ga³ , is substituted for a part of the Fe³ ions of the pure YIG, all of the trivalent ion will be substituted for the Fe³ ions at the tetrahedrel site if the substituted quantity δ is not so large. Therefore, the magnetic moment in one molecule is given as follows Then, the soft magnetic plate 5 shown in Figure 1 is formed by Mg Mn Al ferrite having the temperature characteristics shown in Figure 2, and the permanent magnet 4 is formed by one of Md₂Fe₁₄B, CeCO₅ and 5mCo₅ to thereby form a YIG thin film filter having a centre frequency of 1.575 GHz. In this connection, there are shown in Table V calculated values of a necessary thickness ℓm of the permanent magnet, a necesary thickness ℓx of the ferrite, and the frequency variation Δf at 55 A change in the frequency variation Δf with respect to the Ga substituted quantity δ is plotted in Figure 8. Referring to Figure 8, curved lines 70A , 70B and 70C correspond to the cases of using Nd₂Fe₁₄B magnet, CeCo₅ magnet and SmCo₅ magnet, respectively. In all the cases, Δf is positive at δ 0, and the temperature characteristics show an upper convex curvature. Further, Δf is decreased with a decrease in δ. As δ is further decreased, Δf becomes negative, and the temperature characteristics show a lower convex curvature. Thus, it is appreciated that the temperature characteristics of Δf 0 is obtained by selecting the value of δ. In other words, it is possible to nullify a gradient and curvature of the temperature characteristics of the resonance frequency of YIG by selecting a substituted quantity of a non magnetic ion for the Fe³ ion in the YIG thin film of the microwave device according to the materials of the permanent magnet and the soft magnetic plate. Although the present invention has been described as applied to a microwave apparatus using a fixed frequency in the above embodiment, it may be applied to a variable type YIG thin film microwave apparatus including a coil not shown wound around the yoke 3 in the magnetic circuit 2. As has been described above, microwave apparatus having good temperature characteristics may be provided by employing a permanent magnet and a soft magnetic plate each having respective specific characteristics in a magnetic circuit for applying a bias magnetic field to a microwave device which utilises the magnetic resonance of the YIG thin film. Furthermore, since it is possible to provide microwave apparatus having good temperature characteristics where both gradient and curvature of the temperature characteristics are compensated for, the extent of utilisation of the microwave apparatus may be enlarged to increase the industrial advantage by effectively employing the YIG thin film feature of the microwave apparatus, which is superior in terms of mass production, as previously mentioned.
