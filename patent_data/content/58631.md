# Power transmission unit with infinite speeds.

## Abstract
A rotor of the transmission is journaled within a stationary housing 1 and is driven by rotatable gear rack components 16, 17 therein. A pinion gear 12 drives the gear rack components by sequentially meshing with spaced apart parallel gear racks 20, 21, 22, 23 on each component. A speed selector assembly positions the pinion gear to engage a greater or lesser number of gear rack teeth. A gear train 7, 10 couples the pinion gear to a power input shaft 8 . Speed changes between the input shaft and a rotor driven output shaft 24 are effected by positioning of the pinion gear away from the rotor axis resulting in the gear rack components moving eccentrically within the rotor 18 . A cam structure 13 acts on each gear rack component to control meshing of the gear racks on the component with the pinion gear.
