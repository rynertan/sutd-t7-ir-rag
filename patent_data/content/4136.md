# Aromatic polyethersulphones, their preparation, dispersions thereof and their use as adhesives and coatings.

## Abstract
Aromatic polyethersulphones that are particularly useful as adhesives and coatings having end groups of formula OCH₂COR, where R is alkyl or alkoxy. Preferred examples are OCH₂COCH₃ and OCH₂COOC₂H₅. Such polymers may be made by heating polyethersulphones made from halophenates or bisphenate dihalide mixtures, in the presence of a reagent of formula XCH₂COR X is halogen, preferably chlorine , such as chloroacetone or ethyl chloroacetate, for a short period of time. Such polymers of low molecular weight RV 0.25 are of particular use in coating compositions comprising a dispersion of a fluorocarbon polymer dispersed in a solution or dispersion of the polyethersulphone.
