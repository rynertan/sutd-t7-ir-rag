## Description
ALUMINUM LiPlIlUM ALLOY 1 Background of the Invention The present invention relates to aluminum lithium alloys and more particularly to an elumrium llthium alloy composition with high fracture toughness and high strength. It has been estimated that current large commercial transport aircraft may be able to save from 15 to 20 gallons of fuel per year for every pound of weight that can be saved when building the aircraft. Over the projected 20 year life of an airplane, this savings amounts to 300 to 400 gallons of fuel. At current fuel costs, a significant investment to reduce the structural weight of the aircraft can be made to improve overall economic efficiency of the aircraft. The need for improved performance in aircraft of various types can be satisfied by the use of improved engines, improved airframe design, andImproved or new structural materials in the aircraft. Improvements in engines and aircraft design have generally pushed the limits of these technologies.However, the development of new and improved structural materials is now receiving increased attention, and is expected to yield further gains in performance. Materials have always played an important role in dictating aircraft structural concepts. In the early part of this century, aircraft structure was composed of wood, primarily spruce, and fabric. Because shortages of spruce developed in the early part of the century, lightweight metal alloys began to be used as aircraft structural materials. At about the same time, improvements In design brought about the development of the all metal cantilevered wing. It was not until the 1930 s, however, that the metal skin wing design became standard, and firmly established metals, primarily aluminum alloys, as the major airframe structural material.Since that time, aircraft structural materials have remained remarkably consistent with aluminum structural materials being used primarily in the wing, body and empennuge, and with steel comprising the material for the landing gear and certain other speciality applications requiring very high strength materials. Several new materials are currently being developed for incorporation into aircraft structure. These include new metallic materials, metal matrix composites and resin matrix composites. It is believed that improved aluminum alloys and carbon fiber composites will dominate aircraft structural materials in the coming decades. While composites will be used in increased percentages as aircraft structural materials, new lightweight aluminum alloys, and especially aluminum lithium alloys show great promise for extending the usefulness of aluminum alloys. Heretofore, aluminum lithium alloys have been used only sparsely in aircraft structure. The relatively low use has been caused by casting difficulties associated with aluminum lithium alloys and by their relatively low fracture toughness compared to other more conventional aluminum alloys.Aluminum lithium alloys, however, provide a substantial lowering of the density of aluminum alloys as well as a relatively high strength to weight ratio , which has been found to be very important in decreasing the overall weight of structural materials used in an aircraft. While substantial strides have been made in improving the aluminum lithium processing technology, a major challenge is still to obtain a good blend of fracture toughness and high strength in an aluminum lithium alloy. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides a novel aluminum alloy composition that can be worked and heat treated so as to provide an aluminum lithium alloy with high strength, good fracture toughness, and relatively low density compared to conventional 2000 Series aluminum alloys that it is intended to replace. An alloy prepared in accordance with the present invention has a nominal composition on the order of 2.45 weight percent lithium, 0.6 percent magnesium, 1.8 percent copper and 0.12 percent zirconium. By underaging the alloy at a low temperature, an excellent blend of fracture toughness and high strength results. Detailed Description of the Invention An aluminum lithium alloy formulated in accordance with the present invention can contain from about 2.2 to about 2.8 percent lithium, 0.2 to 0.8 percent magnesium, 1.5 to 2.1 percent copper and a maximum of 0.15 percent zirconium as a grain refiner. Preferably from 0.1 to 0.15 percent zirconium is incorporated. All percentages herein are by weight percent based on the total weight of the alloy unless otherwise indicated. The magnesium in the alloy functions to increase strength and slightly decrease density. It also provides solid solution strengthening. The copper adds strength to the alloy.Zirconium functions as a preferred grain refiner. Iron and silicon can each be present in maximums up to a total of 0.3 percent. It is preferred that these elements be present only in trace amounts, limiting the iron to a maximum of 0.15 percent and the silicon to a maximum of 0.12 percent, and most preferably to less than 0.10 percent and 0.10 percent, respectively. Certain trace elements such as zinc, may be present in the amounts up to, but not to exceed, 0.25 percent of the totaL Other elements usch as chromium and manganese must be held to levels of 0.05 percent or below.If the maximums of these trace elements are exceeded, the desired properties of the aluminum lithium alloy will tend to deteriorate.The trace elements sodium and hydrogen are also thought to be harmful to the properties fracture toughness in particular of aluminum lithium alloys and should be held to the lowest levels practically attainable, for example on the order of 15 to 30 ppm 0.0015 0.0030 wt. u for the sodium and less than 15 ppm 0.0015 wt. t and preferably less than 1.0 ppm 0.0001 wt. for the hydrogen. The balance of the alloy, of course, comprises aluminum. An aluminum lithium alloy formulated in the proportions set forth in the foregoing paragraph is processed into an article utilizing known techniques. The alloy is formulated in molten form and cast into an ingot. The ingot is then homogenized at temperatures ranging from 9250F to 10000 F. Thereafter, the alloy is converted into a usable article by conventional mechanical formation techniques such assrolling, extrusion or the like. Once an article is formed, the alloy is normally subjected to a solution treatment at temperatures ranging from 9500F to 10000 F, quenched in a quenching medium such as water that is maintained at a temperature on the order of 700 F to 1500 F. If the alloy has been rolled or extruded, it is generally stretched on the order of 1 to 3 percent of its original length to relieve Internal stresses. The alumium alloy can then be further worked and formed into the various shapes for its final application. Additional heat treatments such as solution heat treatment can be employed if desired. For example, an extruded product after being cut to desired length are generally solution heat treated at temperatures on the order of 9750 F for 1 to 4 hours. The product is then quenched in a quenching medium held at temperatures ranging from about 700 F to 1500 F. Thereafter, in accordance with the present invention, the article is preferably subjected to an aging treatment that will increase the strength of the material, while maintaining its fracture toughness and other engineering properties at relatively high levels. In accordance with the present invention, the articles are subjected to a low temperature underage heat treatment at temperatures ranging from about 2000 F to about 3000 F. It is preferred that the alloy be heat treated in the range of from about 250n e to 275 F. At the higher temperatures, less time is needed to bring about the proper balance between strength and fracture toughness than at lower aging temperatures, but the overall property mix will be slightly less desireable.For example, when the aging is conducted at temperatures on the order of 2750 F to 3000 F, it is preferred that the product be subjected to the aging temperature for periods of from 1 to 40 hours. On the other hand, when aging is conducted at temperatures on the order of 250 F or below, aging times from 2 to 80 hours or more are preferred to bring about the proper balance between fracture toughness and strength. After the aging treatment, the aluminum lithium articles are cooled to room temperature. When the low temperature underaging treatment is conducted in accordance with the parameters set forth above, the treatment will result in an aluminum lithium alloy having an ultimate strength on the order of 65 to 70 ksi.The fracture toughness of the material, however, will be on the order of 1 1 2 to 2 times greater than that of similar aluminum lithium alloys subjected to conventional aging treatments, which are normally conducted at temperatures greater than 3000 F. The superior strength and toughness combination achieved by the low temperature underaging techniques in accordance with the present invention also surprisingly causes some aluminum lithium alloys to exhibit an improvement in stress corrosion resistance when contrasted with the same alloy aged with standard aging practices. Examples of these improved characteristics will be set forth in more detail in conjunction with the ensuing example. Example The following example is presented to illustrate the superior characteristics of an aluminum lithium alloy aged in accordance with the present invention and to assist one of ordinary skill in making and using the present invention. Moreover, it is intended to illustrate the signifcantly improved and unexpected characteristics of an aluminum lithium alloy formulated and manufactured in accordance with the paramters of the present invention. The following example is not intended in any way to otherwise limit the scope of this disclosure or the protection granted by Letters Patent hereon. An aluminum alloy containing 2.4 percent lithium, 0.6 percent magnesium, 1.8 percent copper1 0.15 percent zirconium with the balance being aluminum was formulated. The trace elements present in the formulation constituted less than about 0.25 percent of the total. The iron and silicon present in the formulation constituted less than 0.07 each percent of the formulation. The alloy was cast and homogenized at about 9750 P. Thereafter, the alloy was hot rolled to a thickness of 0.2 inches. The resulting sheet was then solution treated at about 9750 F for about 1 hour. It was then quenched in water maintained at about 700 F. Thereafter, the sheet was subjected to a stretch of 1 1 2 percent of its initial length and then cut into specimens.The specimens were cut to a size of 0.5 inch by 2 1 2 inch by 0.2 inch for the precrack Charpy impact tests, one method of measuring fracture toughness. The specimens prepared for the tensile strength tests were 1 inch by 4 inchcs by 0.2 inches. A plurality of specimens were then aged for 16 and 40 hours at 2750 F, and at 2500 F for 40 and 72 hours. Each of the specimens aged at each of the temperatures and times were then subjected to the tensile strength and precrackCharpy impact tests in accordance with standard testing procedures. The specimens underaged at 2750 F at ultimate strengths ranging from about 65 ksi to about 70 ksi with the toughness on the order of 650 to 750 in lbs in2. The specimens at 2500 F exhibited an ultimate strength ranging from 62 to 65 ksi, while the toughness in the range of 750 to 850 in lbs in2. These values compare with toughness values less than about 450 in lbs in2 for similar materials aged at temperatures over 3000 F, yet having similar ultimate strengths. The present invention has been described in relation to various embodiments, including the preferred formulation and processing parameters.One of ordinary skill after reading the foregoing specification will be able to effect various changes, substitutions, other equivalents and other alterations without departing from the broad concepts departed herein. It is therefore intended that the scope of the Letters Patent granter hereon will be limited only by the definition contained in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
