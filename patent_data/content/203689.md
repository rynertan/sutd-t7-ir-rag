# Preparation of alkoxy halides.

## Abstract
Alkyl , aryl or alkylaryl alkoxy halides are prepared by reacting the corresponding alcohol, phenol or alkyl phenol with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide in the presence of an amine catalyst to form an alkoxy alcohol, and directly reacting the latter with a halogenating agent in the continuing presence of the amine catalyst. Neutralisation of the product and or catalyst removal from the first stage is no longer necessary and reaction rates and yields are increased in the second stage.
