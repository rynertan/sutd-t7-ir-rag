# ADSORPTIVE SEPARATION OF METHANE AND CARBON DIOXIDE GAS MIXTURES

## Abstract
A process is described for separating gas mixtures containing a primary gaseous component and a secondary gaseous component by selective adsorption of the second ary gaseous component in an adsorptive process including the steps of adsorption in at least one adsorbent bed, rinsing said bed with secondary component, depressurizing and evacuating said bed without addition rinsing and repres surizing said bed with primary gaseous component. The process is particularly attractive for recovering carbon diox ide and methane from landfill gas.
