# Resilient tipped needle valve and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A needle valve is formed by molding a resilient tip 200,220 to a rigid body 204 having a tip receiving cylindrical portion 206 or barrel which includes tip retaining means 208, 210, 212 for securing the resilient tip thereto The tip 200,220 is then ground until the outer edge 216 of the barrel 206 is engaged to form a resilient single angle or simple conical tip 200 thereby to eliminate distortions which may be present in the molded tip 220 . The tip retaining means may comprise either a socket 208 formed into the distal end of the barrel 206 or a mushroom shaped bayonet projection 212 extending therefrom
