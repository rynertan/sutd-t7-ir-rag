# A MOWING MACHINE

## Abstract
A mowing machine comprises a main frame 6 made up of driving units 36 and intermediate pieces 35 which are mounted alternately on a tie member 42 . The tie member 42 is placed unter tension, so pressing the driving units 36 and the intermediate pieces 35 together to make the main frame 6 substantially rigid. The driving units 36 have cutting units 8 which are driven by a drive shaft 41 through bevel gearing 46, 47 . A venting means 65 70 being provided to each of the driving units for venting the space around the bevel gearing. The direction of rotation of each cutting unit 8 can be altered by removing the gear 46 and replacing it the other way round.
