# An arrangement in apparatus for preparing solutions from harmful substances.

## Abstract
An arrangement in apparatus for preparing solutions from dry harmful materia, such as cytostaticum, radioactive, toxic and allergy producing substances, includes a glass ampoule 1 for accommodating the dry substance. The ampoule communicates with a device 4 for enlarging the internal volume of the ampoule, so as to equalize the pressure generated therein when preparing the solution. Solvent is introduced into the ampoule 1 and solution removed therefrom through a cannula 8 which is constantly sheathed against contamination by means of an elastic sheath 10 . The sheath is provided with self sealing means 11 arranged to sealingly abut the ampoule 1 when with drawing solution therefrom, in a manner to tightly seal the ampoule against the surroundings.
