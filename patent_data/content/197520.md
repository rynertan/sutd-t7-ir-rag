# Magnetic recording reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording reproducing apparatus, which performs at least one of the two functions of recording and reproducing by using a flexible magnetic recording medium 1 with a magnetic recording layer of a thin metal film, and which has a magnetic head 2 , a drive unit 4, 5, 7 and a recording reproducing circuit 6 . The drive unit 4, 5, 7 causes a relative movement between the magnetic head 2 and the magnetic recording medium 1 in accordance with recording reproducing. The recording reproducing appar atus is operated in accordance with the drive unit 4, 5, 7 and inputs outputs a recording reproducing signal with respect to the magnetic head 2 . The magnetic head is formed such that its surface contacting the magnetic recording medium 1 has a radius of curvature of 40 to 100 mm. The speed of relative movement of the drive unit 4, 5, 7 at least in the access mode is 1.5 to 5.0 m s.
