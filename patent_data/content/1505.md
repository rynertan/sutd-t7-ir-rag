# An inductive sensor assembly for use on a ground vehicle.

## Abstract
An inductive sensor assembly for use on a ground vehicle to provide signals representing deviations of the vehicle from a reference path defined by a current carrying guidewire. The assembly includes a plurality of coils L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6 arranged in a predetermined pattern, each of the coils L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6 providing a respective voltage which varies in accordance with horizontal displacement of the coil from the guidewire, and means for combining the voltages to provide a first signal which is proportional to the heading of the vehicle independent of lateral displacement and means for combining the voltages to provide a second signal proportional to the lateral displacement of the vehicle independent of heading.
