# A method of improving characteristic of a body.

## Abstract
The characteristics of surfaces of bodies made from a basic material 22 which is mouldable at low temperatures, such as concrete or concrete like materials are improved by applying a layer of metal 12 to one or more surfaceparts thereof. The metal layer may be applied by moulding the basic material, optionally with reinforcements 23 against a prefabri cated metal member 12 which may be a metal layer formed on a surface 21 of a model or a mould 20 whereby a metal coated tool for casting or shaping articles corresponding to the model or mould may be made from the basic material. The prefabricated metal member may also be a thin metal coating which is to end up as an exterior coating of the body and which has been applied on a smooth surtace of a member which is re movable, such as by melting or chemical treatment. Thereby, exact thin metal surfaces may be provided on e.g. concrete like bodies. The mouldable material is, in particular, a material which in its cured state comprises a coherent matrix, the matrix com prising A homogeneously arranged solid particles of a size of from about 50 Å to about 0.5 µm, or a coherent structure formed from such homogeneously arranged particles, and B densely packed solid particles having a size of the order of 0.5 100 µm and being at least one order of magnitude larger than the respective particles stated under A , or a coherent structure formed from such densely packed particles, the particles A or the coherant structure formed there from being homogeneously distributed in the void volume be tween the particles B, the dense packing substantially being a packing corre sponding to the one obtainable by gentle mechanical influence on a system of geometrically equally shaped large particles in which looking surface forces do not have any significant effect, optionally additionally comprising, embadded in the ma trix, C compact shaped solid particles of a material having a strength exceeding that of ordinary sand and stone used for ordinary concrete. Example of such a material is one in which the particles A are silica dust having a specific surface of about 250,000 cm² g, the particles B are cement particles, and the bodies C are refractory grade bauxite.
