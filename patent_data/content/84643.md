# A process for preparing graft and block copolymers.

## Abstract
A process for preparing block and or graft copolymeric compositions by forming an intimate mixture of two or more polymers, at least one of which includes one or more amino junctions and at least one of the remaining polymers in cludes one or more carboxylic acid junctions and an effec tive amount of a phosphite compound, and thereafter heat ing the intimate mixture at a temperature and for a time sufficient to form the desired block and or graft copolymers.
