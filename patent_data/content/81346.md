# Tinting polyurethane.

## Abstract
A process for tinting a transparent polyurethane comprising a colouring step, followed by a fixation step characterized in that the colouring step comprises the immersion of the polyurethane into a bath which is maintained under continuous agitation and which comprises a dispersion of one or more colourants in an aqueous solution containing a surfactant or wetting agent and in that the fixation step comprises a heating and rinsing treatment is disclosed. More particularly, the present invention relates to the tinting of polyurethane, for example in the form of sheets or laminates, for optical applications. For example, in one particularly useful embodiment of the present invention, the tinted polyurethane may serve as a selective filter having almost zero transmission in the so called cutoff range of wave lengths of from 350 to 560 nm. Eyeglasses made from such lenses are particularly useful for victims of aphakia and retinitis pigmentosa.
