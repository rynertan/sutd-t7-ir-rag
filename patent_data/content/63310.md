# Projection unit with separable lamp capsule and slidable means for ejecting same.

## Abstract
A projection unit for use within a slide or film projector, or a microfilm viewer. The unit comprises an electrically insulative holder, a socket forming part of the holder s rear upstanding segment, a glass reflector secured to the holder s front segment such that its forward aperture aligns with an opening in the front segment, a tungsten halogen lamp removably located within the socket and not engaging any of the interior surfaces of the reflector, and a slidable ejector e.g., elongated bar member for engaging the sealed end of the lamp and ejecting it out through the glass reflector s forward opening. Replacement of the lamp is thus possible without replacing the glass reflector. In addition, the inven tion maintains constant referencing characteristics to there by enable successive, similar lamps to be precisely oriented within the reflector without the need for a prefocusing operation.
