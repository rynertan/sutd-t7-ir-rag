# RULER FOR TRIMMING.

## Abstract
A ruler for trimming for use in trimming a photographic film, a drawing and so forth. Noting the fact that the four apexes of a rectangle are invariably located on one cir cumference, the trimming ruler is arranged such that an L shaped ruler 15a is pivotally mounted on a base 11 formed with a circular bore 12 , and an L shaped ruler 15b is pivotally mounted on a slide plate 25 which is slidable on the base 11 , whereby it is possible to obtain a rectangle extremely easily with the two L shaped rulers 15a, 15b and the bore 12 . Moreover, it is possible to obtain a rectangle of any desired size which is similar to the rectangle obtained simply by sliding the slide plate 25 .
