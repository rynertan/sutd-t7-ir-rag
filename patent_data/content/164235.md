# Polymer membrane.

## Abstract
Porous membranes of aromatic polymer preferably ether ketone are prepared with pore size and surface area allowing use in place of asbestos membranes in hot alkaline electrolysis cells. The membranes are prepared by solvent extraction of a polymer which is partially incompatible with the aromatic from a blend of the two. The membranes are preferably dried in the presence of a surfactant to enhance re wetting in use.
