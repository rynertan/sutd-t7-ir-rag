## Description
The present invention relates to an information holding device as known from US A 42 42 736. In the past, a device made of a liquid crystal having a smectic phase with a display function and an information holding function and a device made of a dielectric material such as PLZT has been known as information holding device. Hereinbelow, a liquid crystal device having a display function and an information holding function will be explained as an example of an information holding device. Liquid crystal devices of various display principles including a liquid crystal having a nematic phase, a liquid crystal having a cholesteric phase or a liquid crystal having a smectic phase are known. In those devices, orientations of liquid crystal, molecules are changed by an external field and the resulting change of an optical property is used to display the information. As an example of such liquid crystal devices, a thermal writing type liquid crystal device disclosed in US A 3,796,999 Locally Erasable Thermo Optic Smectic Liquid Crystal Storage Displays will be explained below. In the disclosed device, transparent electrodes 13 and 14 are arranged on the inner surfaces of a pair of glass substrates 11 and 12 as shown in Figure 1a, and the space between them is filled with a liquid crystal 15 having a smectic phase. A laser beam 16 emitted from an argon Ar laser or a yttrium aluminum garnet YAG laser is focused on the display panel through a lens 17 to heat the smectic liquid crystal 15 of an area 18 to be displayed, thereby rendering it into an isotropic liquid crystal phase. Then, the laser beam is removed to quickly cool the liquid crystal to the smectic phase. As a result, orientations of the liquid crystal molecules are disturbed and a region 19 which exhibits a strong scattering property is produced as shown in Figure 1b. Since this scattered state persists stably, a desired image information can be stored. Based on the display principle described above, the thermal writing type display device can write a desired image information on the liquid crystal elements by the scan and the modulation of the laser beam, and local erasure is attained by the application of an electric field. Thus, it is preferable as a display device, but it does not have the function to read out the stored image information or the function to output the information to an external device such as a computer and it is merely used as an input device of an image information signal. Other known liquid crystal devices e.g., US A 4,196,974 also have only the function of displaying the image and they are not used as an information output device. US A 42 42 736 discloses an information holding device comprising at least two opposing electrodes arranged in shape of an x y matrix, a dielectric between said electrodes, means to change the capacitance of the dielectric in the part between said two electrodes, means to apply a voltage varying with time to the dielectric of said opposing part, and means to detect principally a displacement current flowing through the dielectric of said opposing part. It is the object of the present invention to eliminate the disadvantages described above, and to provide an information holding device capable of inputting outputting an information signal in such a way that an information holding device made of a dielectric such as a liquid crystal having a smectic phase is endowed with the function of writing in and reading out information in short time. This object is accomplished with an information holding device as claimed in claim 1. Dependent claims are directed on features of preferred embodiments of the invention. The object and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of embodiments. Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described in detail by taking as an example a liquid crystal having a smectic A phase. Figure 2 shows a diagram of the general arrangement of a liquid crystal device according to an embodiment of the present invention. The picture information writing means 21 is a means for changing the capacitance of a liquid crystal having a smectic A phase as serves as the dielectric of the opposing part between one electrode and the other electrode of substrates, thereby to write picture information such as characters and symbols into a liquid crystal panel 22. The picture information written in the liquid crystal panel 22 is read out by a picture information reading voltage generator circuit 20 which generates a voltage varying with time to be applied to the liquid crystal in the opposing part of the electrodes, and a picture information detector circuit 23 which detects principally a displacement current flowing through the dielectric of the opposing part of the electrodes. The picture information read out is sent to a picture signal converter circuit 24. A picture information signal produced here is fed into an external circuit 25 which is composed of, for example, a microprocessor CPU . Next, the arrangements and operations of the respective portions will be described. A schematic sectional view of the liquid crystal panel 22 is shown in Figure 3, while a schematic plan view is shown in Figure 4. In the liquid crystal panel, a gap of about 10 µm is defined between a pair of substrates 26 and 27 which have a plurality of Y electrodes 29 and a plurality of X electrodes 30 juxtaposed on their opposing surfaces in a manner to intersect each other, and a liquid crystal 31 having a smectic A phase is contained between the substrates and is sealed by a spacer 28. Here, the opposing parts between the Y electrodes 29 and the X electrodes 30 become picture elements and form a matrix as a whole. Although, in the present embodiment, each of the substrates is provided with the plurality of electrodes, it may well be provided with a single electrode. The substrates 26 and 27 may be glass plates or plastic plates, or the non viewing substrate may be an opaque substrate such as a Si substrate and the viewing substrate may be a transparent substrate such as a glass plate or a plastic plate. The electrodes 29 and 30 may be transparent conductive films such as mixture of indium oxide and tin oxide, or the electrode on the viewing substrate may be the transparent conductive film and the other electrode may be a metal such as Aℓ or Cr. The liquid crystal material may be mixture including where R is an alkali radical which exhibit a positive dielectric anisotropy and the smectic A phase at room temperatures and changes from the smectic phase to a nematic phase at 42 C and from the nematic phase to an isotropic liquid phase at 45 C. Other liquid crystals having the smectic A phase are mixture of 4, 4 alchoxy biphnyl carboxylic acid alkyl ester and 4, 4 alkyl cyanotran and mixture of 4 alchoxy phenyl 4 alkyl benzoic acid ester and p,p alkyl cyano biphenyl. When dichronic dye is added to the liquid crystal, a viewing angle property of display is improved and it is desirable to the display device. Figure 5 shows an optical characteristic of the liquid crystal having the smectic phase. When the liquid crystal having the smectic phase is heated, it exhibits an isotropic liquid phase point c and an essentially transparent state. When the liquid crystal layer is cooled while a sufficient voltage is applied thereto, it exhibits a smectic phase point a and an essentially transparent state, and this state is retained non write state . On the other hand, when the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer is set to or about zero volt, it exhibits a smectic phase having a scattering property point b and the brightness is reduced. This state is retained thereafter write state . The present inventors have found that when the voltage applied to the liquid crystal layer is changed in the course of cooling the liquid crystal layer, the amount of scattering changes so that a tonality is imparted to the display. The inventors have also found that a static capacitance of the liquid crystal having the smectic phase does not substantially change for several days to several months after the electric field or the heat has been removed. Interfaces between the electrodes 29 and 30 and the liquid crystal having the smectic phase are treated with silane surface active agent so that they are homeotropically oriented, that is, the liquid crystal molecules having the smectic phase are oriented in a direction perpendicularly to the substrates, although they may be oriented in a direction parallel to the substrates. The liquid crystal material is not limited to the liquid crystal having the smectic phase but it may be other liquid crystal such as a liquid crystal having a cholesteric phase whose orientation is changed by the application of an external field and retained for a predetermined time period after the external field has been removed. Next, the picture information writing means 21 will be described. Figure 6 shows means for writing picture information by projecting a laser beam on the liquid crystal panel which employs the liquid crystal having the smectic phase. The means of Figure 6 is provided with a laser pen 33 which can condense the laser beam on any desired position. The laser pen 33 to be used is, for example, one which is constructed of an optical fiber for guiding the laser beam from a light source and a condensing lens, or one in which a semiconductor laser 34 and a condensing lens 35 are made unitary. The inventors have experimentally confirmed that the writing of picture information can be achieved by condensing laser power which is at least 10 mW on the surface of the liquid crystal element. Figure 7 shows another picture information writing means. It is constructed of a laser 36, a modulator 37 which modulates the laser beam, a deflector 38 for the X direction and the Y direction which deflects the laser beam in any desired direction, and a lens 39 which condenses the laser beam on the surface of the liquid crystal element. The laser 36 which the inventors use is, for example, a YAG laser whose power is 1 W in the single mode and whose beam spread angle is within 1 mrad. An acoustooptic modulator is employed as the modulator 37. By way of example, a plane mirror galvanometer whose angle can be controlled by the quantity of current is used as the deflector 38. In either system, the laser beam is absorbed by the electrodes 29 or the electrodes 30, and the electrodes are heated. As a result, the liquid crystal having the smectic phase is also heated to change into the isotropic liquid phase. When the laser beam is subsequently removed, the liquid crystal is rapidly cooled to change into the smectic phase again. At this time, the orientation direction of the liquid crystal molecules is disordered, and the liquid crystal scatters external light and falls into a written state because this scattered state continues to exist stably. Further, the part of the liquid crystal not irradiated with the laser beam exhibits the initial state non write state and is in the transparent state. In bringing the whole area of the liquid crystal panel into the initial state, the purpose can be attained in such a way that a D.C. voltage or A.C. voltage is applied across the Y electrodes 29 and X electrodes 30 after the whole area of the liquid crystal panel has been heated or that a comparatively great D.C. voltage or A.C. voltage is applied without heating. Next, another embodiment of the picture information writing means for the liquid crystal panel which employs the liquid crystal having the smectic phase is illustrated in Figure 8. The structure of the liquid crystal panel 46 is the same as that of the liquid crystal panel shown in Figure 4. Switches 42a 42c are connected to the terminals on one side, of Y electrodes 43a 43c formed on one substrate, while the terminals thereof on the other side are connected to GND 0 V . Further, switch pairs 41a 41c are connected to X electrodes 44a 44c formed on the other substrate. A heating power source 47 is connected to the switches 42a 42c, while a driver circuit 40 is connected to the switch pairs 41a 41c. The driver circuit 40 produces a selecting voltage V V Here, in a case where, among the picture elements of the liquid crystal panel 46, hatched ones e₁₂, e₁₃, e₂₁, e₂₃, e₃₁ and e₃₂ are assumed to be in the write state scattering stage and the others e₁₁, e₂₂ and e₃₃ in the non write state transparent state , voltages shown in Figure 9 are applied to the X electrodes 44a 44c and the Y electrodes 43a 43c. In the state in which all the switch pairs 41a 41c are turned off , the switch 42a is turned on for a fixed time so as to apply a heating voltage V Subsequently, when the switch 42a is turned off to remove the heating voltage V The operations stated above are similarly performed as to the Y electrodes 43b and 43c in succession. Next, the principle of a method of reading out picture information will be described. As stated before, the liquid crystal having the smectic phase for use in the present embodiment exhibits the positive dielectric anisotropy. That is, the relationship between dielectric constant ε In the non write state thus far described, accordingly, the liquid crystal molecules are oriented perpendicularly to the electrodes, and dielectric constant of the liquid crystal layer is approximately equal to dielectric constant ε Besides, in the write state, the orientation direction of the liquid crystal molecules is conspicuously disordered. Assuming that the orientation direction be completely random, the specific inductivity of the liquid crystal layer becomes close to the three dimensional average value 1 3 ε Here, when the picture elements e₁₁ e₃₃ arranged in the shape of the matrix as shown in Figure 8 are considered as a kind of capacitors, the liquid crystal panel 46 can be deemed a group of capacitors 48 as shown in Figure 10. Since, at this time, the respective picture elements are filled with the liquid crystal layer being the dielectric between the electrodes, their capacitances differ owing to the unequal dielectric constants caused by the different molecular orientations between in the write state and in the non write state as described before. Accordingly, the capacitance C The inventors measured the capacitances by the use of a liquid crystal material of ε Besides, in a case where the liquid crystal material having the positive dielectric anisotropy is used and where the initial orientation is rendered the horizontal orientation, C As stated above, the picture element in the write state and that in the non write state have unequal capacitances. By electrically reading out the difference of the capacitances, therefore, the written information can be recognized and outputted to an external device. There will now be explained embodiments of the picture information reading voltage generator circuit 20, the picture information detector circuit 23 and the picture information signal converter circuit 24 which are shown in Figure 2. Figure 10 shows an example of the fundamental setup of the picture information reading method. The liquid crystal circuit 48 is such that the liquid crystal panel shown in Figure 8 is expressed by the equivalent circuit of the capacitors. Electrodes consist of X electrodes 49a 49c and Y electrodes 50a 50c. Here, it is assumed that the picture information of one e₁₁ of the picture elements 51 be read out. To this end, the Y electrode 50a is supplied with a reading voltage V On the other hand, a current voltage converter circuit 55 is connected to the X electrode 49a. Further, the output of this circuit is applied to a waveshaping circuit 56. The output shaped here is applied to the picture information signal converter circuit 24. The other X electrodes 49b and 49c are connected to a constant voltage source 54. Here, the reading voltage V That is, the feature of the present invention consists particularly in reading out information by regarding the picture element e₁₁ as the capacitance and deciding the magnitude of a displacement current principally. Figures 11a to 11c show the situation at the time at which the capacitance of the picture element e₁₁ is read out. Here, the capacitances of the picture elements e₁₁, e₂₁ and e₃₁ are denoted by C₁₁, C₂₁ and C₃₁ respectively. It is assumed by way of example that the reading voltage V as shown in Figure 11a, and that a wiring resistance r₁ and a wiring resistance r₂ be sufficiently small. Then, the displacement current Now, assuming C₀ C₂₁ C₃₁ in Figure 11b, the following holds The displacement current i t is evaluated by the Laplace transform etc. from Equations 2 and 3 , as follows Here, putting then the following holds From Equation 4 , i t 0 0 and i t K C₁₁. It is understood that the displacement current As shown in Figure 11c, accordingly, the detection of the displacement current Although the picture information may well be read out by detecting the displacement current Further, the detection of the displacement current Even when the reading voltage V The orientation state of the liquid crystal molecules changes when a voltage not lower than a specified threshold value has been applied. Therefore, the reading voltage V Figures 12 and 13 show practicable examples of the current voltage converted circuit 55, wave shaping circuit 56 and picture information signal converter circuit 24. First, in the current voltage converter circuit 55 of Figure 12, a detected displacement current The waveshaping circuit 56 comprises a comparator 62, one input terminal of which is supplied with the output voltage v Further, if necessary, the picture information signal converter circuit 24 temporarily holds an output voltage produced by the waveshaping circuit 56, with a latch timing signal CP In Figure 13, another embodiment of the current voltage converter circuit 55 is especially shown. In this embodiment, the output voltage v Although not illustrated in the embodiments, the application of a D.C. voltage to the non inverting input terminal of the operational amplifier 61 is convenient for the adjustment of the circuit, etc. because the level of the whole output voltage v The voltage waveforms of various parts in Figure 12 or 13 are shown in Figure 14. Here, the comparator 62 is assumed to provide H high level when the detection voltage v Figure 15 shows a practicable example of the reading of capacitances. Switch pairs 68a 68c are connected to Y electrodes 77a 77c. The switches are supplied with a reading voltage V On the other hand, current voltage converter circuits 69a 69c are connected to X electrodes 76a 76c. Further, waveshaping circuits 70a 70c are connected to the current voltage converter circuits 69a 69c. Besides, picture information signal converter circuits 71a 71c are connected to the waveshaping circuits 70a 70c. In operation, when only the switch pair 68a has selected the reading voltage V Now, assuming that the reading voltage V Figure 17 shows another embodiment. Switch pairs 81a 81c are connected to Y electrodes 77a 77c. The switch pairs 81a 81c are supplied with a reading voltage V On the other hand, switch pairs 82a 82c are connected to X electrodes 76a 76c. A constant voltage source 83 is connected to one input terminal of each of the switch pairs 82a 82c, and a current voltage converter circuit 84 to the other input terminal. Following the circuit 84, a waveshaping circuit 85 and a picture information signal converter circuit 86 are connected. The change over of the switch pairs 82a 82c is effected by a scanning circuit 87. Figure 18 shows the voltage waveforms of various parts in Figure 17 under the assumption that picture elements e₂₁, e₂₂ and e₂₃ be in the non write state. The switch pairs 81a 81c are assumed to select the reading voltage V On the other hand, the switch pairs 82a 82c are assumed to select the current voltage converter circuit 84 when the control signals C₁ C₃ are at the H level, and to select the constant voltage source 83 when they are at the L level. As understood from Figures 17 and 18, the picture elements e₁₁ to e₃₃ have their information read out successively one by one in the present embodiment. The feature of the embodiment shown in Figures 17 and 18 is that the numbers of the current voltage converter circuit, waveshaping circuit and picture information signal converter circuit can be minimized. This facilitates the adjustments of the circuits. Figure 19 shows the information holding device according to the present invention in which the information writing and reading circuits thus far described are made unitary. Selector switches 103a 103c are connected to the X electrodes 76a 76c. An X electrode driving circuit 104 is connected to one input terminal of each of the selector switches, while a displacement current detector circuit 105 is connected to the other input terminal. Selector switches 102a 102c are connected to the ends of the Y electrodes 77a 77c on one side. A Y electrode driving circuit 100 is connected to one input terminal of each of the selector switches, while a capacitance reading voltage generator circuit 101 is connected to the other input terminal. Further, switches 106a 106c are connected to the ends of the Y electrodes 77a 77c on the other side. Here, when information is to be written, the selector switches 102a 102c select the Y electrode driving circuit 100, while the selector switches 103a 103c select the X electrode driving circuit 104. In the present device, the writing with a laser beam can be jointly employed. All the switches 106a 106c are brought into the off state for the writing with the laser beam shown in Figure 6 or 7, and all the switches are brought into the on state for the writing based on the heat generation of electrodes shown in Figure 8. On the other hand, when information is to be read out, the selector switches 102a 102c and 103a 103c select the capacitance reading voltage generator circuit 101 and the displacement current detector circuit 105, respectively. At this time, the switches 106a 106c are brought into the off state. According to the present invention, it becomes possible that any desired picture is written into and displayed on a liquid crystal panel from an external circuit on the basis of the heat generation of electrodes, that an observer or user supplements, revises or deletes information with a laser pen at will, and that the information is read out to be delivered to an external circuit. As set forth above, a voltage varying with time is applied to a liquid crystal having a smectic phase, and a displacement current flowing through the liquid crystal is principally detected. Therefore, a capacitance can be detected by at least one time of voltage application, and it becomes possible to read out information in a short time. Further, even when, in a case where picture elements are arranged in the shape of an X Y matrix, currents are flowing through the picture elements other than the picture element to have its capacitance measured, the capacitance can be detected without the influence of crosstalk, and the inputting outputting information signals is permitted by the use of a simple circuit. In the present invention, the liquid crystal having the smectic phase has been exemplified and explained. As stated before, however, the present invention is applicable to any dielectric, such as a liquid crystal having a cholesteric phase or PLZT, whose capacitance is changed by applying an electric field, heat or the like and is stored without change for a fixed time even after the electric field, the heat or the like has been removed. Means for changing capacitances of the dielectrics may be any means to change capacitances of the dielectrics, such as heating means, electric field applying means or electric current applying means. When some or all of the electrodes to be formed on the substrates are made of a metal such as Cr or Al, electrode resistances can be lowered, and the rise or fall response time of the displacement current to be detected can be shortened. This is well suited for fast read out. As described above, according to the first feature of the present invention, an information holding device which is made of a dielectric such as smectic liquid crystal is endowed with the function of reading out information in a short time, whereby an information holding device capable of inputting outputting information can be provided. Further, according to the second feature of the present invention, in an information holding device wherein picture elements are arranged in the shape of an X Y matrix, an information holding device capable of inputting outputting information with a simple circuit without any influence of current attributed to crosstalk can be provided.
