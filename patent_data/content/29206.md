## Description
This invention relates to a reinforcing sole for footwear, in particular long dstance skiing footwear. It is well known that the practice of sport activities, specifically long dstance skiing, requires footwear that exhibit flexibility characteristics in one direction and rigidity or stiffness characteristics in another direction. Considering, in particularm, long dstance skiing footwear, it is noticeable that it must be considerable light in weight, while adequately protecting the foot against water and snow leaks, and leave the ankle articulation almost completely unimpeded, or at least only slightly restrained. In long distance skiing footwear, it is further necessary for the sole to incorporate latching means for an efficient coupling of the footwear to the ski bindings. The solutions provided heretofore have n ot always been successful, especially in providing a sole having good longitudinal flexibility at the plantar region, i.e. in respect of deformations of said sole which result from relative turning about an axis substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the footwear plantar region and substantially parallel to the ground, while having a certain transverse rigidity, namely about an axis extending perpendicularly to the former. This invention sets out to solve the above problem by providing a reinforcing sole for footwear, which affords the possibility of adjusting, in accordance with contingent.requ√èrements, the degree of flexibility and, rectively, rigidity of the footwear, to thus confer to the footwear all those mechanical characteristics which best suit a.selected sport activity. Within the above general aim, it can be arranged that the reinforcing sole according to this invention, while exhibiting greatly improved features, is also simple to manufacture without involving any expensive or complex equipment. It can be further arranged that the reinforcing sole of this invention can be readily formed from elements and materials which are ordinarily available on the market, and i s highly competitive from the economical standpoint. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a reinforcing sole for footwear, in particular long distance skiing footwear, characterized in that it comprises stiffening means elastically flexible in the longitudinal direction, that is in respect of deformations of said sole resulting from relative rotation about an axis substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the footwear plantar region and substantially parallel to the ground, and substantially rigid in the transverse direction, that is in respect of deformations of said sole resulting from relative rotation about an axis extending substantially parallel to the longitudinal extension of the plantar region of said footwear. Further features and advantages will be apparent from a detailed description of some preferred, but not limitative, embodiments of a reinforcing sole for footwear, in particular longdistance skiing footwear, with reference to the accompanying exemplary drawing, where Figure 1 is a bottom plan view of a first embodiment of the sole Figure 2 is a Bottom plan view of a second embodiment of the sole, as incorporating preset resisting sections Figure 3 shows a third embodiment of the sole, with interchangeable elements and Figure 4 is a sectional view taken along the line IV IV of Figure 1. With reference to the drawing figures, and specifically to Figure 1, the reinforcing sole for footwear, in particular long distance skiing footwear, according to this invention, is indicated generally at 1 and has a toe bit 2 at the front, and a heel bit 3 at the rear, which are of conventional design for connection to the footwear and possibly to the ski bindings. At that portion of the sole which spans the plant and arch of the foot, the exposed side of the sole 1 has stiffening means which comprise a plurality of ribs 4 intersecting one another in a substantially perpendicular fashion and arranged to be mutually inclined in one direction and in the opposite direction with respect to the longitudinal centerline of the sole. The ribs 4, which have reduced resisting sections at their crossing points, afford the possibility of imparting elastic flexibility in a longitudinal direction, that is in respect of deformations of the sole 1 resulting from relative rotation about an axis extending substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal lay of the plant region of the footwear and substanti al1y parallel to the ground, while affording good rigidity in a transverse direction, that is in respect of deformations of the sole resulting from relative rotation about an axis substantially parallel to the longitudinal lay or extension of the footwear plantar region.. The embodiment illustrated in figure 1f wherein transverse stiffness is practically ensured by the honeycomb structure of the ribs, lends itself ideally to direct incorporation in the sport shoe sole, to thus confer thereto the aforementioned features this solution affording variation of the rigidity and flexibility characteristics by utilizing the different mechanical properties of the materials employed. With reference to Figure 2, the reinforcing sole has stiffening means comprising a peripheral border 5 connected, at the foot plant, by transverse ribs 6 which define reduced cross section recesses 7 which may include longitudinal ribs 8 interconnecting opposite transverse edges of the recesses 7. This solution, by virtue of the larger crosssection of the transverse ribs 6 with respect to the ribs 8 imparts, at the plantar region, a great transverse rigidity combined with a longitudinal flexibility which can be adjusted and set by suitably dimensioning the border 5 as well as the transverse ribs 8. At the arched region of the foot, there are defined longitudinal ribbings 10 which are interrupted by cutouts 11, which by breaking the continuity of the cross section of the ribbings 10, impart the desired flexibility in the longitudinal direction. The cutouts 11 may have a herring bone or dovetail configuration, or any other configuration effective to ensure a good flexibility in the longitudinal direction together with considerable rigidity or stiffness in the transverse direction. It should be added that by providing the cutout, an elastic element is effectively achieved which favor the return of the sole to its rest position. With reference to the embodiment shown inFigures 3 and 4, a sole, similar in principle to the preceding ones, will be described with the difference that t includes stiffening means which are interchangeable in accordance with contingent requirements. More specifically, the sole has a bordering edge or border 20 which defines a first window 21 at the foot plantar region and a second window 22 at the arched region, said first and second windows being separated from each other buy a transverse embossment 23 effective to impart a certain rigidity in the transverse direction To adjust as desired the transverse rigidity and longitudinal flexibili ty, at the first window 21 there are provided sleeve like seats 24, whereinto a transverse stiffening foi l 25 can be inserted from one side of the sole. Similar sleere seats 24 are provided, for lateral access,.at the arched region of the foot, where a pocket like seat 30 is defi ned wherein a prevailingly longitudinally extending elastic foil 31 can be inserted which imparts the desired elastic flexibility in the longitudinal direction, to allow an elastic recover of the sole which can be adjusted by changing the type of the elastic foi l utilized. With this embodiment, therefore, the user. is enabled to adjust at will, in accordance with the requirements of the intended sport practice, the stiffening foils 25, as well as the elastic foil 31, to thus achieve the mechanical characteristics of the sole which best suit the user s own requirements. Thus, it will beappreciated from the foregoing that the invention achieves its objects, and in particular the fact is pointed out that this sole affords the possibility of manufacturing footwear of a lightweight type the only function whereof is one of protecting the foot, whereas the mechanical properties required of the footwear are in practice delegated to the reinforcing sole of this invention, which sole can provide all those mechanical characteristics which are sought by the user in practicing a sporting activity. The invention as described is susceptible to many modifications and variations without departing from the purview of the instant inventive concept. Moreover, all of the details may be replaced with other, technically equivalent, elements. In practicing the invention, the materials employed, as well as the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any ones to sut individual applicational requirements.
