# Process for forming passivation film on photoelectric conversion device and the device produced thereby.

## Abstract
In a process for forming passivation film on the surface of a photoelectric conversion device having junction be tween hydrogenated amorphous silicon and a conductive electrode, the passivation film is formed by steps of forming a first passivation film of silicon oxide on the surface of the photoelectric conversion device and then forming a second passivation film of silicon nitride on the first passivation film. In this process, the first passivation film is formed under atmosphere of a mixed gas prepared by mixing excessively a gas containing oxygen with silane gas in accordance with the plasma CVD method.
