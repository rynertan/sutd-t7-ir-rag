# Circuit for measuring characteristics of a device under test.

## Abstract
The apparatus for measuring characteristics of a device under test DUT comprises a first signal generator 30, 11 , which may be a crystal oscillator, for generating an input signal having a period T for the DUT 12 , and a second signal generator 30, 25 for generating a sampling signal having a period t nT T m, where n and m are integers. The sampling signal controls a first 13 and a second 15 sampler for sampling the output signal from the DUT 12 and the input signal to the DUT 12 , respectively. The sample amplitudes are converted to digital by A D converters 14, 16 and evaluated by a microprocessor 17 to obtain the characteristics of the DUT 12 . The second signal generator may include a fractional N oscillator 25 for high accuracy and resolution and may additionally include a phase locked loop circuit 21, 22, 23 coupled to the fractional N oscillator 25 to reduce phase noise and jitter thereof.
