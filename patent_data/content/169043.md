# Weftless flexible tape made of polymeric material, its method of manufacture, and containers reinforced therewith.

## Abstract
A weftless tape designed to be adhered directly to fibrous material and serving to reinforce containers made of such material, such as cartons and corrugated cardboard. The tape is used to reinforce the carrying handles of such containers, prevents bulging and tearing of the containers and can also be used as a rip tape. The tape has a thickness between 0.05 and 0.30 millimetres and is therefore thin enough that it can be, for instance, incorporated between the layers of corrugated board without making an outside bulge and without preventing printing of the container outside surface. The tape may be used in high speed folding carton or corrugated cardboard making machinery. The tape comprises a single ply of juxtaposed, parallel yarn ends, of polymeric material, with an adhesive bonding the yarn ends together, each yarn end having a gauge from 100 to 12000 deniers, the yarn ends being flattened with their greater dimension parallel to the opposite main faces of the tape. For manufacturing the tape, up to 350 yarn ends are passed under tension around a straight member to flatten the same, and whilst still separate, the yarn ends are passed through a bath of a bonding agent and subjected to trans axial pressure while in said bath to continue flattening of the yarn ends. Then, upon leaving the bath, the yarn ends are brought together weftwise to parallel touching relationship and under constant longitudinal tension then the yarn ends are subjected to a scraping action on both faces with further flattening action then the tape is dried by application of heat and then by being exposed to ambient air. While being heated, the tape is exposed to progressively increased tension. The invention is also directed to various types of corrugated board and single ply carton containers incorporating the tape which is used for reinforcing of parts, such as handles, hand holds and finger holds, for anti bulging and also as a rip tape, without the necessity of providing serrations of scoring of the carton or corrugated cardboard. The tape reduces the cost and increases the strength of the fibrous material content of the container.
