# Method and apparatus for modification of climatic conditions.

## Abstract
A fog generator comprises a duct 1 which is preferably vertical and very tall, means for moving air down through the duct, air directing means 3 which includes a spout 7 to direct the air emerging from the duct in a substantially hori zontal stream in a chosen direction away from the duct and a fog generating means 5 which generates a fog into the mov ing air preferably after the air has left the spout. The spout 7 is preferably rotatable in a horizontal plane. The advantage of the invention over the prior art is that it enables a generated fog to be placed where required by the air stream in which it is entrained rather than relying on natural wind drift.
