## Description
HERBICIDAL 2 ALPHA CHLOROMETHYLSULFONYL PYrnDINE 1 OXIDES This inveniton relates to 2 alpha chloromethylsulfonyl pyri dine i oxides, a herbicidal composition containing such oxide, and a method for herbicidal control of undesirable plant species using such oxide. The herbicidal compounds of the invention have the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, phenyl substituted with at least one of the substituents C1 to C8 alkyl, C1 to C8 alkoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, halogen, trifluoromathyl, tri chioromethyl, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, nitro, cyano, carboxy, carbalkoxy, carbamido, methylsulfonyl dioxymethylene, 2 naphthyl, and 2 2 ,2 dichloro 1 methylcyclopropyl . W. Walter at al., Liebig s Ann., 695 77 1966 , disclose 2 phenylmethylsulfinyl pyridine 1 oxide also called 2 benzyl sulfinylpyridine 1 oxide and 2 phenyl methylsulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide also called 2 benzylsulfonylpyridine 1 oxide , but no utility for these chemicals is disclosed. U.S. patent 3,107,994, Rawlings at al., October 22, 1963, discloses certain herbicidal 2 alkenylthio pyridine 1 oxides, whileU.S. patent 3,155,671, D Amico, November 3, 1964, discloses certain herbicidal benzyl 2 thiopyridine 1 oxides. U.S. patents 3,960,542 and 4,019,893, Plant et al., June 1, 1976 and April 26, 1977 disclose certain 2 sulfinyl and 2 sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxides. The state of the art is further illustrated by such references as E. Shaw et al., JACS 72 4362 1950 and U. S. patent 3,772,307, Kaminsky et al., November13, 1973. The present 2 alpha chlrormethyl sulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide derivatives make possible markedly improved results, specifically in crop selectivity over various compounds of the prior art. Weeds compete with crops for light, moisture, nutrients and space. Thus, weeds inhibit the production of foliage, fruit or seed of agricultural crops. The presence of weeds may also reduce the quality of the harvested crop and reduce harvesting efficiency.Weed control is essential for maximum production of many agronomic and horticultural crops including soybeans Glycine max L. peanuts Arachis hypogaea L. cotton Gossypium sp. sunflower Helianthus annuus L. and cucumber Cucumis sativus L. In accordance with the invention, there ae provided new herbicidally effective 2 alpha chIoromethylsulfonyl pyridine 1 oxides of the formula stated above. The 2 alpha chloromethylsulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide derivatives of the invention are useful for preemergence control of weeds, and are furthermore remarkable for their ability to selectively control weeds without injury to desirable crops. Excellent control of weeds such as switchgrass Panicum virgatum L. , goosegrass Eleusine indica L. Gaertn. , giant foxtail Setaria faberi Herrm. , yellow foxtail Setaria lutescens Weigel Hubb. , green foxtail Sertaria viridis L. Beauv. and barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli L. Beauv. can be achieved with such chemicals as 2 alpha 2, 5 dimethylphenyl alpha chloromethylsulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide, without injury to such crops as cucumber Cucumis sativus L. . Surprisingly, the herein described 2 alpha chloromethylsulfonyl pyridine 1 oxides are unexpectedly more selective herbicides than their corresponding precursors or corresponding alpha metnyl substituted herbicides. The procedures for using the present 2 alpha chloromethylsulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide derivatives as herbicides may be in accordance with conventional agricultural practice. The chemicals are ordinarily applied as formulations containing a carrier and or surface active agent. The formulation may contain more than one of the described 2 alpha chloromethylsulfonyl pyridine 1 oxide derivatives if desired other active herbicides may be included in the formulation as well. Thus, the chemical may be impregnated on finely divided or granular inorganic or organic carriers such as attapulgite clay, sand, vermiculite, corn cobs, activated carbon or other granular carriers known to the art. The impregnated granules may then be spread on the soil. Furthermore, the chemical may be formulated as a wettable powder by grinding it into a fine powder and mixing it with an inactive powdered carrier to which a surface active dispersing agent has been added. Typical powdered solid carriers are the various mineral silicates, e.g., mica, talc, pyrophyllite and clays. The wettable powder may then be dispersed in water and sprayed on the soil surface or weeds.Similarly, an emulsifiable concentrate may be prepared by dissolving the chemical in a solvent such as benzene, toluene, or other aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon to which a surface active dispersing agent has been added. The emulsifiable concentrate may then be dispersed in water and applied by spraying. Suitable surface active agents are well known to those skilled in the art and reference may be had toMcCutcheon s Detergents and Enulsifiers, 1970, Allured Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey or Hoffman et al. U.S. patents 2,614,916, cols. 2 to 4 and 2,547,724, cols. 3 and 4, for example of appropriate surface active agents. The concentration of active chemical in the formulation may vary widely, e.g., from 1 to 95 .The concentration of active chemical in dispersions applied to the soil or foliage is almost invariably from 0.002 to 75 . The chemical is frequently applied at rates of 0.10 to 25 pounds per acre. For use as a preemergence herbicide, the chemical is applied to soil which contains weed and crop seed either to the surface of the soil or incorporated into the upper one to three inches of soil . The most suitable rate of application in any given case will depend on such factors as soil type, soil pH, soil organic matter content, the quantity and intensity of rainfall before and after treatment, the air and soil temperature, light intensity and light duration per day. All of these factors can have an influence on the efficacy of the chemicals for use as herbicides. The herbicidal use may include selective weed control in crops such as cucumber, soybeans, cotton, and peanuts. Compounds of the invention may be used for selective control of various grasses in diverse crops including Cucumber cucumis sativus L. , alfalfa Medicago sativa L. , cotton Gossypium sp. , soybeans Glycine max L. Merr., peanuts Arachis hypogaea L. , tomatoes Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. and tobacco Nicotiana tabacum L. . Application may be in aqueous solutions or suspensions which may be sprayed onto the soil surface prior to weed and crop emergence and before or after the crop seed is sown. The soil may receive a shallow tilling less than 3 inches after application of the chemical, but this is not required as it is with some preemergence herbicides. The compounds of this invention may also be applied by broadcast of a granular formulation prior to weed and crop emergence. Various weeds such as crabgrass Digitaria ischaemum Schreb. Muhl. may be controlled by postemergence application of compounds of this invention. Compound of this invention may be added as a tank mixn to other herbicide solutions so that the number of different weed species controlled in a single application will be increased. The formulations of invention compounds may also include other herbicides so that the spectrum of weeds controlled by spray or granular application may be increased. The types of starting materials most generally employed in the preparation of these compounds are known and desdribed in the literature. These parent 2 aryl methyl sulfonylpyridine 1 oxides are prepared by methods cited in U. S. patent 3,960,542.
