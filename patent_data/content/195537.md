## Description
This invention relates to a novel method for the production of cyclopentenylheptanoic acid derivatives, which derivatives belong to the class of compounds called prostaglandins . Prostaglandins possess many pharmacological effects such as the ability to impede the coagulation of blood platelets, the ability to lower or elevate blood pressure, the ability to contract smooth muscles, and the ability to suppress the excretion of gastric juices. Prostaglandins therefore are useful as drugs for the prevention and cure of various diseases such as thrombosis, hypertension and peptic ulcers. There are many known methods for the production of prostaglandins. All of these known methods are long and complicated see, for example, Agr. and Biol. Chem., The inventors of the present invention have studied earnestly to develop a method for the production of prostaglandins easily and at a low cost, and found that reaction of a compound having the general formula In the above reaction, a solvent is preferably employed, and the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a palladium salt such as palladium acetate, an organophosphorus compound such as triphenyl phosphine or an amine such as triethylamine. A solvent is not necessarily needed however, its use makes the operation of the reaction easier. Examples of the solvent are acetonitrile, N,N dimethylformamide DMF and alcohols. The compound I used as the starting material in the present invention can be easily produced by reacting a heptanoic acid derivative having the formula The compound III wherein R is a hydrogen atom may be obtained by the treatment of the reaction mixture with water. The compound III wherein R is an alkyl group may be obtained by treating the reaction mixture with an alcohol, and then treating the product thus obtained with water to effect a decomposition. For example, the reaction mixture is treated with methyl alcohol and the product thus treated is decomposed with water to produce a methyl ester derivative. The compound I wherein X is a bromine atom may be treated with sodium iodide in a solvent, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or DMF, to provide the compound I wherein X is an iodine atom. The compound I wherein X is a bromine or iodine atom is novel, and is an important intermediate for the production of prostaglandins. As regards the starting materials for use in the present invention, it has been already found by the present inventors see EP A 0150996 that 7 2,5 dioxocyclopentyl heptanoic acid of high purity is produced very easily and inexpensively by subjecting 1 cyclooctenyl acetate, 1 cycloocetenyloxytriorganosilane or 1 alkoxycyclooctene and related compounds , and succinic anhydride or succinyl halide to a Friedel Crafts reaction and treating the resulting reaction product with water, an aqueous acid or an alkaline solution. Specifically, a heptanoic acid derivative having the formula In the foregoing formulae, R¹ is an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atons, an aryl group or an aralkyl group, R² is an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, an aryl group such as phenyl group, or an aralkyl group such as benzyl group, and X¹ and X² are each a halogen atom such as chlorine or bromine, with X¹ and X² preferably being the same. As the catalyst, a Lewis acid for use in Friedel Crafts reactions is adopted. Examples of the Lewis acid are aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, tin chloride, boron trifuoride, zinc chloride and titanium tetrachloride. It is not necessary to use a solvent for the reaction however, when a solvent is used, it helps to promote the reaction. Examples of the solvent are methylene chloride, 1,2 dichloroethane, nitromethane, nitrobenzene, 1,1,2 trichloroethane and 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane. The presence of a halotrialkylsilane having, for example, about 1 to 5 carbon atoms in the alkyl group thereof such as chlorotrimethylsilane in the reaction system proves advantageous because these compounds improve the yields. It has been found that the isolation of 7 2,5 dioxocyclopentyl heptanoic acid from the reaction mixture and the refinement of the separated acid can be accomplished in a simple manner, for example by extraction with a solvent, extraction with an aqueous alkaline solution and washing with water. Accordingly, the above mentioned method may be said to be extremely easy and advantageous. In this invention, when 1 cyclooctenyl acetate is selected as the cyclooctene derivative for use as the starting material, the acetate derivative of the desired product can be produced very easily in high yield by the reaction of isopropenyl acetate with cyclooctanone in the presence of an acid. When 1 cyclooctenyloxytrimethylsilane is selected as the starting material, the cyclooctene derivative of the desired product can be prepared by the reaction of chlorotrimethylsilane with cyclooctanone in the prescence of triethylamine. When 1 alkoxycyclooctene is selected as the starting material, the cyclooctene derivative of the desired product can be produced by the reaction of an alkyl orthoformate with cyclooctanone in the presence of an acid. Those specific reactions are examples of those that can be carried out, using various starting materials, and many variations thereof will readily produce the same results as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. By the present invention, via the 7 2,5 dioxocyclopentyl heptanoic acid derivatives, prostaglandins can be produced very easily and inexpensively as described above, and accordingly the present invention is very useful. In this respect, the known method for the production of prostaglandin B₁, using malonic acid diethyl ester as a starting material, is as follows As described before, the present invention permits the prostaglandins to be produced from cyclooctanone as the starting material through only 4 steps. The procedure of the reaction and isolation and the purification of the product are extremely simple. Thus, the present invention is decisively improved over the conventional method in terms of production process, equipment and the like.
