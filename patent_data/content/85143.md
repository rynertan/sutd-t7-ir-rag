# Infrared temperature probe for high pressure use.

## Abstract
An infrared temperature probe for high pressure use is in the form of a hollow bolt adapted to be threaded into a complementary threaded aperture in the wall of a pressure vessel with the end thereof disposed flush with the internal surface of the pressure vessel wall. An infrared transparent window is secured in the end of the hollow bolt with one surface thereof disposed flush with the end of the bolt. A bundle of optical fibers is secured within the opposite end of the hollow bolt and a glass rod is mounted within the hollow bolt in operative relation to the window and the optical fiber bundle for transmitting infrared radiation from the window to the optical fiber bundle. The interior of the hollow bolt may be supplied wth a circulating cooling liquid or gas. An infrared temperature probe can also be used with a mold having an aperture for receiving an ejector pin wherein the hollow ejector pin is provided with an impact surface at one end and an infrared transparent window in the opposite end for receiving infrared radiation from a hot moulded article within the mold when the elector pin is located within the aperture in the mold. A bundle of optical fibers extends through the hollow elector pin and is disposed in optical transmitting engagement with the window.
