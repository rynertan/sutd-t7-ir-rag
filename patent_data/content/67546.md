# A method and apparatus for cleaning gas contaminated particulate material by multiple passes of the material through a vacuum chamber and between containers which are cycled or flip flopped through an arc of 180 degrees.

## Abstract
An apparatus 10, 110 and method are disclosed for cleaning gas contaminated particulate material such as powder metal. The gas contaminated powdered metal is passed through a vacuum chamber 12, 112 having a gas outlet 14, 114 connected to a vacuum pump 119 which evacuates the chamber 12, 112 . The vacuum chamber 12, 112 has first 20, 120 and second 22, 122 ends with a flow passage at each end for directing the flow of the particulate material into and out of the chamber 12, 112 . The gas contaminated particulate material is subjected to an electric field in the vacuum chamber 12, 112 to electrically charge the gaseous contaminates and cause separation of the gaseous contaminates from the powdered metal to facilitate the removal 14, 114 of the gaseous contaminates from the vacuum chamber 12, 112 . First 24, 124 and second 26, 126 containers are connected to the flow passages of the vacuum chamber 12, 112 . A support means 42, 142 supports the vacuum chamber 12, 112 and the containers 24, 124, 26, 126 for initially positioning the first container 24, 124 above the second container 26, 126 to allow the particulate material to flow from the first container 24, 124 through the vacuum chamber 12, 112 and into the second container 26, 126 and for thereafter rotating the vacuum chamber 12, 112 and the first 24, 124 and second 26, 126 containers while they are connected together to reposition the second container 26, 126 above the first container 24, 124 to allow the particulate material from the second container 26, 126 to return in the opposite direction back through the vacuum chamber 12, 112 to the first container 24, 124 .
