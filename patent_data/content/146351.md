# Document processing system and method.

## Abstract
A document processing system and method for locating intelligence data such as the monetary amount on a document 24 . The documents 24 are sensed by an imaging device 58 to provide intelligence data which is presented in the form of a matrix of binary data which corresponds to image data associated with a financial document 24 such as a check or deposit slip. From the matrix of binary data, an input character located on a predetermined side of the data is examined. If the input character is identified as a clue character, it means, generally, that a portion of the matrix of binary data which is associated with the clue character may be the binary data associated with the monetary amount. In the embodiment described, the clue characters are asterisks and dollar signs of different expected varieties. Having found the binary data associated with the monetary amount, it can be subjected to character recognition techniques to machine read the monetary amount on the document 24 .
