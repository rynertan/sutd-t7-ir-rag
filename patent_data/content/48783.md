# A two sided solar panel.

## Abstract
This invention covers a two sided solar panel with radiation capturing surfaces on both faces 1, 2 rather than just one, that is on the anterior and posterior faces with respect to the direction of the rays. One or more coupled mirrors 3 on each panel, whether their shape is falt, spherical or other, are positioned outside the shadow cast by the panel itself, at such an inclination that rays incident upon them are reflected onto the posterior face 2 of the panel. In this way, the irradiation is the same on the anterior and posterior faces.

## Claims
Claims 1. Two sided solar panel with radiation capturing surfaces not on one face only but rather on both the anterior and posterior faces, with respect to the direction of the rays one or more coupled mirrors on each panel, whether flat, spherical or other, are positioned outside the shadow cast by the panel itself, at such an inclinat ion that rays incident upon them are reflected onto the posterior face of the panel so that the irradiation is the same on both anterior and posterior faces. 2. Solar panel according to claim 1, characterized in that said mirrors are operated by a timer or similar device of a known type to follow the course of the sun during the day in such a way that by varying their inclination they always reflect the solar rays onto the posterior face of the panel. 3. Solar panel according to claims 1 and 2, characterized by anterior and posterior faces 1 and 2 on which fall respectively the direct rays and those reflected by flat or concave mirror 3 or 4 so as to heat the water they contain this heated water then passes through tubes 5 to reach heat exchanger 6 with accumulation of thermal energy, through the action of pump 7 and controlled by differential thermostat 8, of a known type a timer operates mechanism 9 for orienting mirrors 3 or 4. 4. Solar panel according to claims 1 and 2, characterized by theoretical focal point 10 which would be formed above face 2 of the panel by rays collected on a wider surface area of concave mirror 4 however, in actuality this does not occur because said rays are blocked and absorbed by said posterior face 2 of the panel and then transformed into thermal energy. The entire invention is substantially as described and illustrated and has the specified aims.

## Description
A two sided solar panelThis invention involves a solar panel capable of absorbing radiant energy both on the face directly exposed to the sun and on the opposite usually shaded one, with a resulting increase in total energetic yield.Currently, solar panels of various types and properties are known. However, all of these have as their major aim the capture and transformation of the radiant energy incident on their anterior surfaces, with consequent heating of water or other liquids.The aim of this invention is to double and further improve the yield of current solar panels, of practically equal dimensions, in order to obtain in a known type of hydraulic installation, either a much larger quantity of hot water or water at higher temperatures than those possible with known panels of equal surface exposed to the sun.This aim is achieved in a solar panel with radiationcapturing surfaces not on one face only, but rather on both the anterior and posterior faces, with respect to the direction of the rays. One or more coupled mirrors on each panel, whether their shape is flat, spherical or other, are positioned outside the shadow cast by the panel itself at such an inclination that rays incident upon them are reflected onto the posterior face of the panel. In this way, the irradiation is the same on both anterior and posterior faces.These mirrors are operated by a timer, or similar device, of known type to follow the course of the sun during the day in such a way that by varying their inclination, they always reflect the solar rays onto the posterior face of the panel.The invention is illustrated in detail in the attached drawings, where two preferred but non limiting variants are schematized.Figure 1 shows a two sided panel and flat coupled mirrors, complete with hydraulic installation.Figure 2 shows a concave mirror variant.In particular, the solar panel is shown with anterior face 1 and posterior face 2. The direct rays and those reflected by flat mirror 3 or concave mirror 4 fall on faces 1 and 2 respectively to heat the water they contain. This then passes through tubes 5 to reach heat exchanger 6, with accumulation of thermal energy, through the action of pump 7 and under the control of differential thermostat 8, of a known type. A timer operates mechanism 9 for orienting mirrors 3 or 4. In figure 2, theoretical focal point 10 is shown. This would be formed above face 2 of the panel by rays collected on a wider surface area of concave mirror 4. However, in actuality this does not occur because said rays are blocked and absorbed by said posterior face 2 of the panel and then transformed into thermal energy.Of course, while the principle of the finding remains the same, the types of realization and particulars of construction may be varied widely from that described and illustrated here, without going beyond this invention.
