Figure 2 shows the C cuit breaker of fig. 1 in condit ion of manual opening Figure 3 shows the same circuit breaker in condition of automatic opening Figure 4 shows the circuit breaker in an intermediate condition of the automatic opening step Figure 5 is a side view of the moulded case of the sin1 e poI circuit breaker of Pigg. from 1 to 4.Referring to said figures the single pole circuit breaker, according to the present invention. is contained in a moul led cease composed by a bottom shell 1 and a covering shell. 2 couplin r along an edge 3, the covering shell. 2 having a depth lessen that the depth of the bottom shell 1 and being removed in fig. 1 2 3 4.Said moulded case, according to the known art, is produced by moulding shells 1 and 2, preferably in a insulating mat erial that cannot be deformed in condition of overheating and cannot be scored by the sparking of the contacts, such as dicvanamide or aldehyde resins and the like. The bottom shell 1 shows a peripheral wall 4 higher than the wall oF the covering shell 2 and is provided with a bottom wall 5 from which pins, ribs or seats project and that are obtained by being moulded integral with the bot tom shell and that will be recited from time to time in the specification.The moulded case on one of its sides is provided with an opening 6 through which the handle 7 of the manual operat ing member 8 does pass, the latter having a flattened shape of reduced thickness and outlined as a circular sector.The arcuate edge of the operating member 8 is limited by an arcuate wall 9 the arc amplitude of which does close the opening t in every position oF the manual operating member aicl manual operating member 8 is provided at it apex with a fork 10, having an arcuate bottom and engaging a pin 11 rising from the bottom wall 5, so that the manual operating Ineniber R may swing around the pin 11 and may be easily mounted mechanically, thus avoiding the centering problems.Over the flattened portion of the manual operating member ft, a latching cradle 12 runs, said latching cradle having an end 13 provided with a hole through which it may be pivoted on a pin 14 projecting from the bottom wall 5. The Came end 13 is provided with a projectinn 19 designed to constitute i thrust member For the movable contact carrier in d way that will be specified hereinafter.The other end 16 of the latching cradle 12 ends with a tip 17 designed to be latched on the upper edge of an opening 18 provided on a trip lamina 19.Said trip amina 19 has its upper end accomodated in a seat 20 provided at the peripheral portion of the bottom shell 1.At the other end 21 said trip lamina 19 is connected to a bimetallic lamina 23 by means of a calibration screw 22, the head ef the latter being accessible through an opening 22 . The trip lmming 19, near its nl 21 holds up a movable armalure 21 of mognelizoble ron, which has the shape of a plate of proper thikness.This arrangsment l I I ow the t r i ppinq of the tip 17 by displacement of the trip laming 19 either in the event of an overload current that by heating the bimetallic lamina 23 causes the bending of the latter and the pulling of the trip lamina 1 , or in the event of a short circuit current that causes the sudden dllraction of the armature 24 towards the bimetallic 1 lamina 23. The bimetallic lamina 23, in turn, is electrically connected to .I terminal 2, to which an external conductor is fixed, the connection being realized throught a rigid con doctor 06 having one of its ends connected to the upper end 27 of the bimetallic lamina. The other end 28 of the bimetallic lamina 23 is electrically connected to a movable contact carrier 29 through a flexible conductor 30.The latching cradle 12, in its middle portion, is provided with an appendix 31 projecting outward, said appendix defining a recess 32 with the outer edge of the same latching crad e. A relief 33 projects near the edge of the manual operating member 8 end from the surface facing the latching cradle 12, said relief being shaped as a circular sector and being designed to interfere with the dppenrlix 31 dncl the recess 3 1 ternatively in a way that will be dec crited hereinaf ter. An arm 34 is provided after the arcuate portion of the mov ible contact carrier 29, said arm 34 having the distil end shaped as a fork 35 the bottom of said fork being arc sated, so that the fork may be pivotable on a pin 36 prov ided in the middle portion of the latching cradle 12.The movable contact carrier 29 carries a movable contact 37 designed to get in touch with a stationary contact 3P, carried by a stationary contact carrier 39 integral with a terminal 40 to a which a second exterior conductor is fixed.The movable contact carrier 29 can be of the kind carrying two juxtaposed movable contacts designed to touch two corresponding stationary contacts according to the known art.An arcuate spring 41 is connected between the manual oper atinq member 8 and the movable contact carrier 29 and its function is to bias the movable contact carrier towards the manual operating member 8. said id arcuate spring 41 is constituted by a spring steel bar and is bent at its upper end, as to provide a pivoting pin in a hole 42 of the manual operating member 8 and it is also ben at its lower end to provide a pivoting pin in a hole 43 of the movable contact carrier 29. From the arrangement above discussed it may be seen that the manual operating member 8, the latching eradle 12 and the arm 34 of the movable contact carrier 20 are all flatfened members of reduced thikness so that the thev do not reg uire specific machinings, therefore they may be produced at a low cost. Moreover, said members are partially overl apped ont on top of the other, the encumbrance of the whole over center snapping mechanish being reduced with respect to the mechanismsof the known art. It is also evident that said members, comprising the arcuate spring 41, are connec ted such in a way that the may be easily assembled mechan cally without relevant centering problems of the pins.Furthemore is has to be noted that the pivoting pin 11 of the manual operating member 8 and the pivoting pin 36 of the movable contact carrier 29 are disposed between the ending pins of the arcuate spring 41 so that in the closed position they are both on one side of the line passing through the ending pins of the spring 41while in the open position, both automatic and manual, they are disposed on the opposite side of said line.Moreover, this arrangement supplies a bias to the latching cradle 12, said bias at the tripping moment makes the latching cradle move upward, i.e. towards the manual operating member 8The upward movement of the latching cradle 12 had already been obtained by some of the prior art circuit breakers, hut the latching cradle, the movable contact carrier and the manual operating member r3equired a complex construction. said complex consiruction not allowing the mechanicdi dssembly, ds it may be noted in the single pole eircuit breaker diselosed in the u.s. Patent n. 3.818.168. frlhe operation of the single pole circuit breaker of the invention will be specified with reference to figures 2, 3 e 4. Fig. 2 shows the circuit breaker in the manually open con l ition reached by moving the manual operating member 8 by means of the handle e 7. The swinging of the manual operating member P causes the displacement of the hol e 12 so that as soon as the line joining holes 42 and 43 has Passed over the pin 36, corres ponging to the over center position, the movable contact carrier snaps in the open position rotating around said pin 36 that remains stationary with the latching cradle 12.The convex edge of the arcuate portion of the movable cont act carrier 29 interferes with a shoulder 44 provided by d web rising from the bottom wall 5, as to limit the opening path of the contact 37 with respect to the stationary contacts 38. Viq. 3 shows t he single pole circuit breaker in the automat ic open condition, as a consequence of at overload or of short circuit current. Tn this case the latching cradle 12 is rele ased by the trip lamina 19 and, because of the bias exerced by the movable contact carrier 29, it rotates upward i.e. towards the handle 7. The pin 3 is consequent y displaced from the right side on the line connecting holes 42 and 43 fig.1 to the left side of said line Fic .3 causing the snap opening of the movable contact carrier 29 as soon as it passes beyond the over center fiq.3 . In this event the movable contact carrier not only does rotate aruound the pin 36, but it follows the upward displac ement of said pin.Consequently, the straight portion 34 of the arcuate edge abuts against the shoulder 44 obtaining a width of the spacement between the stationary and the movable contacts greater that the spacement obtained with the manual operation.in said automatic open position, the spring 41 has caused the displacement of the manual operating member 8 to an intermediate position, as shown in fig.3, said intermediate position being determined by the interference of the relief 33 with the recess 32.The reset of the circuit breaker from the automatic open position of fig.3 takes place as follows.The handle 7 of the manual operating member 8 is initially displaced toward the right side i.e. towards the manual open position , consequently the latching cradle 12 moves because of the interference between the relief 33 and the recess 32 until the tip 17 of the latching chadle 12 is engaged by the hole 18 of the trip lamina 19, reaching the position of fig. 2, during this displacement, the relief 33 runs along the closed edge of the appendix 31 and the movable contact carrier 29 is moved for positioning its convex edge against the shoulder 33.At this moment the circuit breaker mdy ht operated in the On position displacing the manual operating member 8 towards its closed position, reaching the condition of fig. 1 Fig.4 is related to a condition that may occur in case of automatic opening.In effect, it may occur that the movable and stationary contacts 37 38, may become stuck toqheter because of the welding of the materials, otherwise it may occur that the movable contact carrier 20, after an initial opening movement, tends to return towards the stationary contact.The projection 15, carried by the end 13 of the latching cradle 12, has the aim to cause the detachement of the movable contact 37 from the stationary contact 38 and the return stroke of the movable contact carrier to the close position. in offect after the tripping of the latching cradle 12 and clur i.j its rotation. if the movable contact 37 is welded to the stationary contact 38. the projection 15 interferences wi ch the projecting end 29 , causing the detechement of the movable, contact. On the other end, if the movable contact carrier 29,once it is detached 5 5 caused to return toward the closed position, it will in any case meet the projection 15 and will be prevented to return to said closed position.This description is made only by way of example and not as a limitation to the scope of the invention, many variations and modifications may be made and will become appar eni to those skilled in the art said modification and variations Pall within the true spirit and scope of the invention as pointed out by the appended claims.
