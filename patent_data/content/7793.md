# Isothermal shaping of titanium containing workpieces.

## Abstract
A precoat composition including a particulate vitreous material and a particulate lubricant material graphite and or boron nitride dispersed in an organic medium comprising a solution of a polymeric binder is applied to the workpiece, and the workpiece is heated to a temperature 1000 to 1400 F sufficient to remove 538 to 760 C the organic medium and leave a residue of vitreous material and lubricant material on the workpiece. The workpiece is then inserted in a heated split die at 1350 to 1750 F and the die loaded to alter the shape 752 C to 960 of the workpiece. The ratio of the lubricant material to the vitreous material is at least 1 1 and the particle size of the lubricant material and the vitreous material is not more than 200 mesh US Series , this being important for the surface quality of the shaped work piece.
