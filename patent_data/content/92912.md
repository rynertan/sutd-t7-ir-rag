# MULTILAYER CERAMIC DIELECTRIC CAPACITORS

## Abstract
Conductive and porous end terminations for metal impregnated multilayer ceramic dielectric capacitors are provided by firing a silver, or silver alloy, and glass frit onto respective end regions of a sintered capacitor stack. The exposed silver of the fired terminations is provided with a silver sulphide layer, the latter being a good electrical conductor and acting as a barrier between the silver and the impregnation metal, for example lead, during a subsequent impregnation step, whereby to prevent leaching of the silver. The termination is readily solderable by virtue of the silver sulphide layer being wetted by the lead during the impregna tion step and resulting in a lead coating in the termination.
