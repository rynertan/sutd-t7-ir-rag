# Titanium alloy.

## Abstract
A weldable titanium alloy particularly intended for use at high temperatures and under conditions of high stress in aircraft engines, the alloy having the composition 5.6 aluminium, 4 tin, 4 zirconium, 1 niobium, 0.25 molybdenum, 0.5 silicon, 0.05 carbon, optionally containing 0.2 tungsten and being used in the heat treated condition. The heat treatment would normally comprise a solution treatment above the beta transus, typically at 1080 C, and an ageing or stress reliefing treatment at a temperature of approximately 650 C for approxi mately 24 hours.
