# BACKSIDE GETTERING OF SILICON WAFERS

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process and the resulting semicon ductor wafer 12 wherein the backside 14 of the wafer has applied thereto a layer of polysilicon 15 . Portions of this layer 22 are exposed to an energy beam 20 to recrystallize them into a single crystal silicon fused to and extending from the underlying wafer. The recrystallized portions contact adjacent portions 16, 18 of the polysilicon layer, thereby providing a path for impurities migrating from the wafer to the polysilicon.
