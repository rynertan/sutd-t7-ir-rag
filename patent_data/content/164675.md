# LIFT OFF PROCESS

## Abstract
An improved lift off process for multilevel metal struc ture in the fabrication of integrated circuits by employing lift off layer formed from polymers which undergo clean de polymerization under the influence of heat or radiation and allow rapid and residue free release of an expendable mask . An embedded interconnection metallurgy system is formed by application of the lift off layer of this invention over a cured polymer film or on an oxygen RIE barrier layer previously deposited on organic or inorganic substrate, fol lowed by another barrier over which is then coated a radia tion sensitive resist layer. After definition of the desired resist pattern by imagewise exposure and development, the image is replicated into the barrier by sputter etching in a fluorine containing ambient and subsequently into the base layer down to the substrate by oxygen reactive ion etching which is followed by blanket metal evaporation and finally the lift off by brief heat treatment at the depolymerization temper ature of the lift off layer, and brief solvent soak.
