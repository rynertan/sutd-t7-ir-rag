# Ply applicator.

## Abstract
A means and method are disclosed for applying a stabil izer ply to a tire building drum 17 and more particularly a means and method for cutting and applying the stabilizer ply material including means for cutting 46 the stabilizer ply material between cords disposed therein and correcting 42 for variations of the cord angles during the application pro cess in order to provide an improved splice between the leading and trailing edges of the stabilizer ply material. The material is received by a pair of co operating tables 26, 27 , the second table being spaced from the first to provide a cutting arm in which the material is cut at an angle by a knife 49 during movement of the cutting means along a rail 47 . A suction manifoild 42 picks up the severed material and trans fers it to the drum 17 The manifold is adjustable to the cut angle of the front edge of each successive piece of material when picking up and transfering the front edge to the drum and adjustable to the cut angle of the rear edge of the piece when picking up the rear edge, and is then adjusted to the front edge cutting angle before depositing the rear edge on the drum
