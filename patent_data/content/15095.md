# An optoelectronic semiconductor device.

## Abstract
An optoelectronic semiconductor device for use in an optical transmission system, comprising an optoelectronic semiconductor element 2 an element housing 8 which sealingly covers said element 2 , and an optical fiber 10 arranged through a through hole 9 which is formed in said element housing 8 . An end of said fiber 10 faces said ele ment 2 , while the other end thereof projects out of said element housing 8 by a predetermined length. The device is characterized in that a light absorbing material 17 is dis posed around said optical fiber 10 within said element hous ing 8 . Said material 17 substantially absorbs the light emit ted from or received by said optoelectronic semiconductor element.
