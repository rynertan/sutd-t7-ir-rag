## Description
Title Apparatus for wrapping cauliflower or like articles The invention relates to an apparatus for wrapping cauliflower or like articles, comprising a frame provided with a table top. Hitherto, the wrapping of cauliflower or like articles has been performed either manually or by means of a complicated and hence expensive apparatus. In the manual method each article is manually wrapped in a sheet of wrapping material to be each time taken from a supply. Self evidently, this i a laborious and time consuming procedure. It is an object of the invention to provide a relatively simple and hence inexpensive apparatus which nevertheless has a high output capacity. To achieve this object, in accordance with the invenion the apparatus is characterized by at least one gripping means mounted for movement along the table top and adapted to feed wrapping material from a supply over the table top having an opening for the article to be wrapped to pass through.After the feeding of wrapping material by the gripping means and the subsequent cutting of the wrapping material, the article can be moved through the opening in the table top while entraining the section of cut wrappimaterial, whereby this section is drawn tightly over the article. The latter is partly a result of the wrapping material sticking to the table top by static friction. In an embodiment of the invention, an enflesschain is mounted on either side of the table top, which chains are provided with gripping means for pulling the leading edge of the wrapping material supplied from a supply roll over the table top, means being provided for cutting off the wrapping material. In another embodiment of the invention, the gripping means comprise a bar mounted between the two endless chains and clamping blocks each secured to one of the chains adjacent to the bar. In this embodiment, each clamping block may be spring biased and provided with a roller arranged for engagement with a guide mounted above the table top. The means for cutting off the wrapping material may comprise a heatable wire or bar operable by a crank mechanism. Furthermore, an auxiliary table may be mounted under the opening in the table top for movement relative to this table top, on which auxiliary table each time an article can be placed which will be provided with a section of wrapping material when passed through the opening in response to an upward movement of the auxiliary table. Self evidently, the movements of the various components are synchronized, thereby allowing the use of a single driving motor. The apparatus according to the invention is an inexpensive semi automatic apparatus affording a considerable increase in wrapping rate as compared with fully manual wrapping methods, which self evidently is of primary importance especially in the case of vegetables. Of course the apparatus may also be used for wrapping articles of a different kind. In illustration of the invention, an embodiment of the wrapping apparatus according to the invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 schematically shows the apparatus according to the invention in sectional view in longitudinal direction Fig. 2 shows the apparatus of Fig. 1 in side view Fig. 3 shows a detail III of the apparatus of Fig. 1 in enlarged view Fig. 4 shows a detail IV of the apparatus of Fig. 2 in enlarged view and Fig. 5 shows a portion of the detail of Fig. 4 in front sectional view. As shown in the drawing, an apparatus for wrapping cauliflower or like articles comprises a frame 1 supporting a table top 2 mounted thereon by means of members bent over at right angles. The frame further comprises slides 3, 4 in which the shafts of the reverse gears or sprockets 5, 6 are mounted, each pair of sprockets supporting an endless chain 7. Each chain has an auxiliary member 8 secured thereto, in which member a clamping member 9 is mounted for pivotal movement and a torsion spring 10 is provided for urging the clamping member into the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 4 in Fig. 3, the table top, amongst other things, has been omitted for the sake of clarity . The two auxiliary members 8 are interconnected through a bar 11 extending normal to the direction of chain movement. A wrapping material supply roll 13 is mounted on a column 12 of the frame. The wrapping material extends over the table top 2 via pressure rollers 15 mounted in a column 14, which pressure rollers are adjustable through a spring 16 and an adjustment bolt 17. The wrapping material is unwound from the roll 13 and moved over the table top 2 by means of the clamping assembly 8, 9 and 10 described above, and the bar 11. For this purpose, the clamping member 9 has its end remote from the bar 11 provided with a rotary roller 18 which is a roller bearing in the embodiment described adapted to engage the respective lateral slide 3 or 4 and a guide 19 mounted on each slide. For achieving accurate engagement of the auxiliary member 8 and the clamping member 9 with the slide 3, 4 and the guide 19 mounted thereon, respectively, each auxiliary member 8 is provided with rollers 20.Furthermore, for achieving proper clamping of the wrapping material between the bar 11 and the clamping member 9, the latter is provided with a recess having a shape corresponding to that of the bar and including a friction lining 21 see Fig. 5 . At the level of the guides 19, the edges of the slides 3, 4 facing the wrapping material supply roll are bent to define run on faces for urging the clamping members 9 into the clamping position. As a result, the wrapping material is automatically gripped by the clamping assemblies when passing the sprockets 5 facing the supply roll and is advanced to a point adjacent the sprockets 6 remote from the supply roll, at which point the clamping members 9 are moved into the position shown in dotted lines in Fig. 4, thereby automatically releasing the wrapping material. A bar 22 heatable by heating means not shown is suspended over the table top from a yoke 23 including sliding bars 24 arranged for sliding movement through blocks 25 secured to slides 3 and 4 respectively. The yoke is coupled to a crank connecting rod mechanism 26 by which it is operated. The table top 2 is provided with an opening 27 dimensioned to substantially correspond to the size of the articles to be wrapped. Should an article of different size be wrapped, a different table top or one or more inserts may be used. By means of the apparatus according to the invention, cauliflower can be wrapped by passing it, after the wrapping material has been advanced over the table and cut by the heatable bar 22, through the opening in downward direction and manually catching it under the table top. Another possibility is to mount an auxiliary table 28 schematically shown only in Fig. 1 under the opening, which auxiliary table is movable in vertical direction along schematically shown 5ides 29. The article 30 to be wrapped, shown in Fig. 1 in dotted lines, can be placed on the auxiliary table and moved Iarl y the iS1e through the opening 27 while entraining the section of wrapping material present on the table top 2. The apparatus further comprises a driving motor 31 adapted to drive via a transmission mechanism not shown a gear 32 and, via gear 33, a pinion 34 mounted on the same shaft as the sprockets 5. A sprocket 36 is driven via a chain 35 from the shaft of the driven gear 32, to the shaft of which sprocket 36 there is connected a crank connecting rod mechanism 37 for operating the auxiliary table 28. The shaft of gear 32 is further connected to the crank of the crank connecting rod mechanism 26 operating the means for cutting off the wrapping material. For the sake of clarity a large number of details has been omitted, which details, however, will be obvious to the worker in the art. For the same reason, the wrapping material is not shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Self evidently,a large number of modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
