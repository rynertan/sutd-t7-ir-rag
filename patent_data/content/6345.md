# The use of an aliphatic, substantially non telogenic carboxylic acid during suspension polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene.

## Abstract
The presence of an aliphatic, substantially non telo genic carboxylic acid having a logK between 1.5 and 10 in the aqueous polymerization mixture during the sus pension polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene in the pre sence of an ionic initiator has been found to reduce the formation of adhesions between polymer particles during the polymerization.
