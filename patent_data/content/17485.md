# A process for enzymatic production of peptides.

## Abstract
A process for producing a peptide comprises reacting a substrate selected from amino acid esters, peptide esters, depsipeptides, optionally N substituted amino acid amides and peptide amides, and optionally N terminal protected peptides, with an amine component selected from amino acids, optionally N substituted aminoacid amides and amino acid esters in the presence of a carboxypeptidase enzyme in an aqueous solution or dispersion having a pH from 5 to 10.5.
