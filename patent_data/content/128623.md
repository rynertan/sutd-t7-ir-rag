## Abstract
In a helical scan video recorder in which the magnetic heads are arranged on bimorph piezoelectric actuators it may be desirable, in order to counteract depolarization of the piezo electric elements, to bias these elements. This is possible without the use of additional slip rings if the elec trode to which the drive voltage is applied is connected, via a diode, to the electrode to which the bias is applied and the bias is applied, alternately with the drive voltage, at instants at which the associated magnetic head is not used. If the lower drive voltage is applied the diode is cut off and the bias is isolated from the drive.
