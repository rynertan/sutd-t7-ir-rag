# SEMICONDUCTOR CIRCUIT.

## Abstract
Semiconductor circuit including a dynamic circuit and a bias voltage generating circuit. The bias voltage generating circuit comprises first and second bias voltage generating circuits 30 and 30 . The former circuit 30 absorbs variable substrate current having a value which is in proportion to an operating frequency of the dynamic circuit while the latter circuit 30 absorbs the substrate current having values which are not in proportion to the operating frequency of the dynamic circuit.
