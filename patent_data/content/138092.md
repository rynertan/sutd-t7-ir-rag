# Method of amino acid analysis.

## Abstract
A method of amino acid analysis by reacting an amino acid containing sample with o phthalaldehyde and an N protective group substituted cysteine such as N acetylcys teine under an alkaline condition to yield a fluorescent compound and measuring the intensity of fluorescence or absorbance of the resulting compound, which is sensitive for quantitative and qualitative analysis of a secondary ami no acid such as proline when it is beforehad subjected to an oxidation.
