# Frictional transmission chain.

## Abstract
An improved frictional transmission chain is provided wherein the transmission of torque forces between pulleys relies upon an endless transmission chain formed from link plates and link plate connection pins. The chain comprises a plurality of frictional V blocks, each having inner and outer lateral surfaces, the inner lateral surfaces having holes therein for receiving opposite ends of at least one of the connection pins, and the outer lateral surfaces forming sub stantially V shaped inclined surfaces. Frictional transmis sion contact surfaces project radially from the outer inclined lateral surfaces, in a transversely symmetrical configu ration, with respect to a V groove pulley with which the transmission chain is adapted to tightly frictionaily engage by means of the V blocks. Power is transmitted along the chain only by the link plates and connection pins of the end less chain, each of the V blocks transmitting power only be tween its respective one connection pin and the pulley.
