# Active cooling system for electrochemical cells.

## Abstract
An active cooling system 40, 41 for cooling electroche mical cells 11 that are arranged in a stack 9 in a fuel cell or battery 3 . The cooling system 40, 41 comprises cooling panels 15, 16 carrying a cooling fluid that flows adjacent to, and parallel to the plane of, each cell 11 . The rate of cooling fluid flow past each cell 11 is made to be substantially equal, so that each cell 11 experiences substantially the same cooling environment, adding to the longevity of the fuel cell or battery 3 . This can be accomplished by equalizing the resistance to cooling fluid flow for each cooling path 12 , e.g., by using pressure equalizing, monoto nically increasingly sized orifices 28 in an input manifold 25 . Dual cooling panels 15, 16 are preferably employed, in a counterflow mode. The panels 15, 16 may be divided into parallel channels 33 . Heat pipe panels 35 containing a two phase fluid may be used in lieu of panels 15, 16 that contain cooling fluid in a single state.
