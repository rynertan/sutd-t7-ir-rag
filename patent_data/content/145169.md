## Description
This invention relates to inorganic scintillation crystals and the method of preparing them, especially for use in various medical and industrial applications.More specifically, the invention relates to the use of a specific type of reflective powder, as a grinding or abrading medium, in preparing the surfaces of the inorganic crystal. In use, the crystal typically is optically coupled to one or more photomultiplier tubes or other detection devices. For years, various inorganic crystals have been used as scintillators for gamma ray and charged particle detection. Among these have been such materials as NaI T1 , CaF2 Eu , CsI Na , CsI T1 and 6LiI Eu , bismuth germanate and CdWO4. A scintillator is a material capable of converting energy lost by ionizing radiation into pulses of light. Light pulses emitted during scintillation are detected by appropriate means, such as a sensitive photomultiplier tube or a silicon diode. Various techniques are used during the preparation of such crystals and in the assembly or mounting of crystals in detectors, in order to optimize the transfer of light from the crystal to the detector. Scintillation detectors are commonly used in medical diagnostic devices.One such device utilizes a camera which is positioned in a stationary relationship with respect to a patient and portrays a spatial distribution of radioactivity, upon the introduction of a radioactive source such as an isotope into the body of the patient. The crystal scintillates as it converts impinging gamma rays from the isotope into light energy. This light energy is transmitted to an array of photo tubes. Each photo tube stimulated by light emits an electrical signal which is proportional to the light energy received by the tube. Photomultiplier tubes typically are placed relative to one another so that they view overlapping co extensive areas of the crystal. A common practice is to use masks at a selected location between the photomultiplier tubes and the crystal to reflect and diffuse the scintillation flashes, so as to achieve a generalized distribution of light to the tubes. The spatial resolution or ability of the tubes to detect and measure accurately and uniformly the occurrence and intensity of events within a crystal is determined by the ability of the system to diffuse and reflect the light. Scintillation crystals used in an imaging device are typically prepared from melt grown crystal ingots.An ingot is cut or cleaved to produce a blank, which is then machined and finished to final tolerances by grinding. Silicon carbide, because of the relative hardness of its particles, is commonly used as a grinding vehicle. This material absorbs considerable light. Thus it must be completely removed from the crystal surface, to prevent the undesirable absorption of light generated within the crystal. To the extent the light is absorbed, it is not available to be seen by the photomultiplier tubes. It is difficult to remove all of the powder, even by washing, because removal could degrade or change the diffusion properties of the crystal surface. Thus some of the silicon carbide powder invariably remains embedded in the surface of the crystal. Aluminium oxide has been used in the past for the polishing of various crystalline surfaces. Because the object of polishing is to produce a specular and not a diffuse surface, it is important to remove all foreign substances from the surface, including all traces of the polishing material. The use of aluminium oxide and magnesium oxide as reflective materials in scintillation detectors is well known, as evidenced by the disclosure of US A 4066908, which describes a well type scintillator in which the reflective powder is packed between the crystal and the housing. According to one aspect of the present invention, a method of manufacture of an inorganic scintillation crystal is provided, in which the crystal surface is prepared by grinding, and is characterized in that the grinding medium used in the final stage of grinding is a finely divided particulate substance having a high reflectivity in a predetermined light emission range and that particles of the substance are left embedded in the surface of the crystal after grinding, whereby the light output of the crystal in the predetermined light emission range is improved. The manufacture of scintillators by the method of the invention leads to an improvement in the total light incident on photomultiplier tubes, resulting in improved spatial resolution, increased pulse height and better energy resolution. According to another aspect of the invention, a scintillation crystal is characterized by having at least one finished surface which has embedded therein particles having a size in the range from 150 to 400 grit and consisting of an inorganic substance having high reflectivity in the spectral region of emission from 200 to 600 nanometres. The invention thus comprises the use of a highlyreflective abrasive powder, such as aluminium oxide or magnesium oxide, to grind the surfaces of an inorganic scintillation crystal. After grinding, the excess powder is removed, e.g. by brushing or blowing, after which a residue remains on and embedded in the surface.The presence of this residue decreases the absorption at the crystal surface and alters the diffusion characteristics of the crystal. This invention is applicable to a wide range of self activated and doped inorganic crystalline scintillators, including such materials as NaI Tl , 6CaF2 Eu , CsI Na , CsI Tl , LiI Eu , TlCl Be,I , CsF, BaF2, Bi4Ge3012, KI Tl , CaWO4 and CdWO4. These scintillators have a maximum emission spectrum in the range from 325 nanometres for BaF2 to 565 nanometres for CsI Tl . Several of the materials, such as NaI Tl ,CsI Na , LiI Eu , CsF and KI T1 , are hygroscopic and thus need special handling in a dry environment during cutting, machining and grinding. These crystals are then enclosed in a moistureproof holder or container to prevent hydration of the crystal. Aluminium oxide is a preferred grinding powder.However, other materials possessing attributes of hardness and high reflectivity may be used. Examples of other suitable materials are magnesium oxide and titanium oxide.The particle size of the grinding medium is typically from 150 to 400 grit, depending on the surface finish desired. Care must be taken, when grinding a hygroscopic crystal, to prevent the introduction of moisture during grinding. Thus the grinding powder must be treated, such as by heating, to remove all moisture and the grinding must take place in a moisture free atmosphere, such as in a dry box. The following example provides a more complete disclosure of the present invention. EXAMPLE A 75mm 3 inch nominal diameter slab of NaI T1 crystal was cut from a larger ingot and was machined to a circular disc having a diameter of 75 mm 3 inches and a thickness of 10 mm 3 8 . The surfaces of the disc were lapped with a 280 grit aluminium oxide grinding powder to give a smooth matte finish. Excess aluminium oxide was brushed off the surface of the disc, which was then coupled to a glass window, which in turn was coupled to a model R 878 photomultiplier tube manufactured by Hamamatsu Corporation. Clear silicon compounds were used to couple the crystal to the glass and the glass to the tube. The crystal was exposed to a 57 collimated Co gamma ray source. After testing, the same disc was reground by conventional grinding techniques using silicon carbide. It was coupled to the same photomultiplier tube and measurements were taken.The pulse height resolution of the conventionally finished crystal was 71 units, whereas that of the crystal with surfaces finished with aluminium oxide was 83 units, an improvement of 17 . Likewise, it was found that the energy resolution of the crystal prepared according to the present invention was 9.6 , as compared to an energy resolution of 11 for the prior art crystal, an improvement of approximately 13 . As previously mentioned, the invention is applicable to a wide range of inorganic scintillation crystals. It consists of using a reflective powder as a grinding medium to improve the reflectivity of the crystal in its light emission. Modifications can be made in carrying out the present invention without departing from the scope thereof. For example, particles having different grit sizes can be blended together in order to produce a grinding medium capable of achieving a predetermined finish on the surface of the crystal. Furthermore, the Al2 0 3 may be blended with MgO or with other grinding materials to change or to control the range of spectral emission. It should be emphasized that other abrasive materials may be used in carrying out the present invention, but only insofar as their reflectivity coincides with the emission peak of the crystal and they are chemically inert with respect to the crystal. The technique of this invention can be used to grind specific surfaces of a crystal in combination with appropriate masking techniques, so as to provide areas within the crystal or on the crystal surface which have differing degrees of reflectivity and absorptiveness.
