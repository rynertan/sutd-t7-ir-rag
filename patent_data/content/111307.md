# SEMICONDUCTOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT HAVING A BURIED RESISTOR

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit includes a p type well region 22 formed on an n type semiconductor substrate 21 . A hole extends from the surface of said p type well region 22 to the substrate 21 and an intrinsic or lowly doped semiconductor 27 is buried through an insulating film 26 in said hole. This semiconductor 27 is used as a resistor.
