# A PROCESS OF FORMING A CONTACT TO A COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR BODY

## Abstract
In the formation of a contact 4 to a compound semicon ductor e.g. of GaAs or GaAIAs body 1 , a layer 2 of a metal e.g. tantalum is used that is capable of chemically reducing the native oxide 3 on the body. By selecting the thickness of the native oxide reducing metal layer the entire quantity of that metal can be converted to discontinuous inclusions of oxide.
