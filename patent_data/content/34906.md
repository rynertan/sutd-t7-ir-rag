# Single facer for making single faced corrugated material.

## Abstract
The second corrugating roll 2 of a machine for making single faced corrugated board is formed from an inner core 11 and a cylindrical sleeve 10 having a number of spaced circumferential grooves 13 . The sleeve may be made up from a number of axially abutted rings 14 , the circumferen tial grooves being formed in the abutting faces of adjacent rings. Longitudinal passageways 17 are provided in the outer peripheral surface of the core 11 and radial apertures 16 connect the passageways with the grooves 13 , so that suction applied to one end of the passageways holds the material being corrugated in the corrugations of the roll 2 . In a modified form the passageways are formed in the inner peripheral surface of the sleeve. The core 11 is hollow and steam, or other heated fluid, passed through it to heat the roll.
