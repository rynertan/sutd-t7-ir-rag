# OPTICAL FIBER FOR LATERAL IRRADIATION OF LASER BEAM

## Abstract
An optical fiber 10, 20, 30 for lateral irradiation of laser beam for making the laser beam to irradiate laterally in a through endoscopic manner in a tubular cavity of an internal organ. According to the present invention, the fiber 10, 20, 30 for the laser beam lateral irradiation has an exiting end 13, 23, 33 thereof formed into a reflectory surface 22, 32 inclined at about 45
