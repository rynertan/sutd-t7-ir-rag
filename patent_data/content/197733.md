# LIQUID DELIVERY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A liquid delivery system is disclosed for use with one or a plurality of individual water blast guns 10 , each of which has an auxiliary shut off valve integral with the gun and also includes electric circuit completion means 46 for operating a pneumatic secondary shut off valve 14 in series with the high pressure liquid supply conduit feeding each gun. This series arrangement of first and second shut off valves in the fluid conduit between the pump discharge and each indi vidual gun assures a fail safe shut off system which gives the operator of each gun the assurance that upon release of the water blast gun trigger that cessation of the water blast from the gun nozzle will occur. Accordingly, the likelihood of the operator falling over backwards upon release of the gun trigger is eliminated and risk of a dropped runaway water blast gun that failed to shut off is eliminated.
