Detailed Description of the InventionSynthesis The following equations are illustrated for the synthesis of compounds of Formula I when J is J ll but can also be used to synthesize J 1 through J 10 in analogous manners by one skilled in the art, taking into account the chemical compatibility with the reaction conditions of Equations 1 81. Compounds of Formula I can be synthesized by one or more of the methods shown below in Equations 1. 2 and 3. Reagents and reaction conditions are given by way of illustration only, Equation 1 depicts the reaction of sulfonyl isocyanates and isothiocyanates II with the appropriate heterocyclic amines of Formula III to give the desired sulfonylureas I.Equation 1EMI30.1 wherein Rld. Q. R. W1 and A are as previously defined. The reaction of Equation 1 is best carried out in an inert aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile at a temperature between 0 and 820C. A catalytic amount of 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2ioctane DABCO may be used to accelerate the reaction. In the cases in which the products are insoluble in the reaction solvent. they may be isolated by simple filtration. When the products are soluble. they can be isolated by evaporation of the solvent and trituration of the residue with solvents such as l chlorobutane. diethyl ether or ethyl acetate, and filtration. Compounds of Formula Ia where W1 is 0 can also be prepared as shown below in Equation 2 by treating sulfonamides of Formula IV with the methyl ester of a pyrimidine or triazine carbamic acid of Formula V in the presence of an equimolar quantity of trimethylaluminum.EQuation 2EMI31.1 wherein Rld, Q, H and A are as previously defined and W is 0. The reaction of Equation 2 is best carried out at temperatures between 25 and 830C in a solvent such as methylene chloride or 1.2 dichloroethane for 12 to 96 hours under an inert atmosphere. as taught in European Patent Application EP A No. 83.975 publishedJuly 20, 1983 . The products of Formula Ia are conveniently isolated by acidifying the reaction solution with dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid. and extraction with a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. If necessary. purification can be achieved by recrystallization or column chromatography. The methyl carbamates V can be synthesized by treatment of the corresponding heterocyclic amines of FormulaIII with dimethyl carbonate or methyl chloroformate in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or pyridine Alternatively. compounds of Formula Ia can be prepared as shown below in Equation 3 by the reaction of sulfonamides IV with the phenyl ester of the appro priate carbamic acid. VI. in the presence of an equimolar quantity of a tertiary amine base such as 1.8 diazabicyclo 5.4.O undec 7 ene DBU .Equation 3EMI32.1 wherein Rld. Q, H and A are as previously defined and W is 0. The reaction shown in Equation 3 is best carried out at about 250C in a suitable solvent such as dioxane or acetonitrile for 1 2 hours under an inert atmosphere as described in European Patent Application No. 70,804 published January 26, 1983 . The desired products ofFormula Ia can be conveniently isolated by acidifying the reaction solution with dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid. In certain cases, the products are insoluble and may be filtered. Alternatively, the aqueous layer can be extracted with a solvent such as methylene chloride or ethyl acetate. Drying and evaporation of the solvent then affords the desired products. The phenyl carbamates VI can be synthesized by treatment of the corresponding heterocyclic amines of FormulaIII with diphenyl carbonate or phenyl chloroformate in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride.pyridine, or potassium carbonate with a catalytic amount of 4 dimethylaminopyridine. The mixture is stirred at temperatures between 250 and 650C in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran for 12 36 hours. A judicious choice of the appropriate methods for preparing compounds of Formulas I and Ia must take into account the nature of the substituents Q and Rld.and their chemical compatibility with the reaction conditions of Equations 1 3. Sulfonyl isocyanates of Formula IIa can be prepared as shown in Equation 4 by the reaction of sulfonamides of general structure IV with phosgene in the presence of n butyl isocyanate and a catalytic amount of 1.4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2joctane DABCO .Equation 4EMI33.1 wherein Q and Rld are as previously defined and W1 is 0. The reaction shown in Equation 4 is best carried out according to the procedure described in UnitedStates Patent 4,238.621. Alternatively, sulfonyl isocyanates IIa can be prepared via phosgenation of the preformed n butylureas of Formula VII as represented in Equation 5.Equation 5EMI33.2 wherein Q and Rld are as previously defined and W1 is 0. The compounds of Formula VII are conveniently prepared by stirring a mixture of the appropriate sulfonamide IV. anhydrous potassium carbonate. and n butyl isocyanate in a suitable solvent such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone at 250 to 800C until all of the isocyanate has reacted. The products are isolated by quenching in dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid and recrystallizing the insoluble solid. The n butylureas VII are then treated with phosgene and a catalytic amount of DABCO in ref fluxing xylenes or chlorobenzene in a manner analogous to that described in the reference cited for Equation 4. Another, somewhat milder, method for the preparation of sulfonyl isocyanates IIa is shown inEquation 6. Treatment of sulfonamides of Formula IV with thionyl chloride gives intermediate N sulfinylsulfonamides VIII, which afford sulfonyl isocyanatesII upon exposure to phosgene in the presence of a catalytic amount of pyridine.Equation 6EMI34.1 wherein Q and Rld are as previously defined and W1 is O. The reaction of Equation 6 can best be performed according to the procedure of H. Ulrich, B. Tucker andA. Sayigh. J. Org. Chem., 34. 3200 1969 . Sulfonyl isothiocyanates of Formula II. whereW1 is S, can be prepared by treatment of sulfonamides of Formula IV with carbon disulfide and potassium hydroxide followed by reaction of the dipotassium salt with phosgene according to K. Hartke. Arch. Pharm., 229. 174 1966 . A judicious choice of the appropriate method for preparing compounds of Formula IIa must take into account the nature of the substituents Q and Rld, and their chemical compatibility with the reaction conditions of Equations 4 6. The requisite sulfonamides of Formula IV can be synthesized by one or more of the methods shown below in Equations 7. 8 and 9. Equation 7 depicts the reaction of sulfonyl chlorides of Formula IX with ammonia to give sulfonamides of Formula IVa.Equation 7EMI35.1 wherein Q and Rld are as previously defined. The amination of Equation 7 is conveniently effected by adding at least two molar equivalents of either anhydrous ammonia or concentrated ammonium hydroxide to a solution of the sulfonyl chloride IX in a suitable solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran. or methylene chloride at temperatures between 300 and 250C. The desired sulfonamides of FormulaIVa are isolated either by filtration, in which case the by product ammonium chloride is removed by washing with water, or extraction into a suitable organic solvent such as methylene chloride or ethyl acetate.Drying and evaporation of the solvent then affords the products IVa, which are usually sufficiently pure to be carried directly on to the next step. Sulfonamides of Formula IVb can be prepared as shown in Equation 8 by treatment of the correspondingN t butylsulfonamides X with an appropriate acid such as trifluoroacetic TFA . polyphosphoric PPA . or p toluenesulfonic acid p TSA .EQuation 8EMI36.1 wherein Q and Rld are as previously defined. The reaction of Equation 8 is conveniently carried out by stirring a solution of the compound ofFormula X in excess trifluoroacetic acid approximately 0.3M at about 250C for 1 24 hours. The desired sulfonamides of Formula IVb are then isolated by removal of the volatiles in vacuo and crystallization from a suitable solvent such as diethyl ether. l chlorobutane. or ethyl acetate. Alternatively, the N t butylsulf on amides of Formula X can be treated with a catalytic amount of p toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate in a solvent such as toluene or xylenes at reflux temperature for 1 6 hours.

Alternatively. sulfonamides of Formula IVc, where Q is Q 1. can be synthesized via the two step procedure represented below in Equation 9 a starting from the 1 2 benzothiazin l,l dioxides of Formula XI.In a similar fashion. sulfonamides of Formula IVd, where Q is Q 51, can be prepared via the two step procedure shown in Equation 9 b starting from the same compounds XI.Equation 9EMI37.1 Equation 9 continuedEMI38.1 wherein Rld. R7, R8, and Rg are as previously defined.Equation 9 a The transformation shown above in Equation 9 a can be conveniently. carried out by adding a suitable base such as n butyllithium n BuLi or lithium diisopropylamide LDA to a solution of the compound of general structure XI in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at 78 C under an inert atmosphere. To ensure complete dianion formation, the reaction mixture is typically allowed to warm to about 300C over a period of 0.5 to 1 hour. and is then recooled and treated with the appropriate epoxide. After being stirred overnight at 780 to 250C. the reaction solution is acidified with dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid and the water layer extracted with a suitable solvent such as diethyl ether or methylene chloride.Drying and evaporation of the organic extracts affords a crude residue which is immediately dissolved in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. and heated at reflux temperature in the presence of a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid for 1 to 4 hours. The desired products of Formula IVc are isolated by extraction into an organic solvent such as diethyl ether or methylene chloride. Drying and evaporation of the organic extracts affords the crude sulfonamidesIVc, which are typically purified by silica gel chromatography elution is achieved with an appropriate solvent system such as 40 80 ethyl acetate hexanes containing 1S methanol.Equation 9 b The transformation depicted in Equation 9 b is carried out in a manner analogous to the one described for Equation 9 a , except that a protected bromoalkanol is employed in the reaction with the dianions of 1.2 benzothiazin l,l dioxides XI to give intermediates of Formula XIII.

The reaction of Equation 11 is accomplished by treating a solution of the substituted aniline XV in concentrated hydrochloric acid with a solution of sodium nitrite in water at 5 to 50C. After being stirred for 10 30 minutes at about OOC, the solution is added to a mixture of excess sulfur dioxide and a catalytic amount of cupric chloride or cuprous chloride in glacial acetic acid at about 100C. The temperature is maintained at about 100C for 1 4 1 hour. then raised to 25 C and stirred for 2 24 hours.This solution is then poured into a large excess of ice water. The desired sulfonyl chlorides IX can be isolated by filtration, or by extraction into a solvent such as diethyl ether or methylene chloride.followed by drying and evaporation of the solvent.

A wide variety of methods exists for effecting the reduction of aromatic nitro groups to the corresponding aniline derivatives. One of the more common procedures involves treating the nitro compounds ofFormula XVIc with a slight excess of stannous chloride dihydrate in concentrated hydrochloric acid at temperatures between 250 and 800C. Alternatively, reduction can be accomplished with iron powder in glacial acetic acid as described by Hazlet and Dornfeld. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 66. 1781 1944 , and byWest, J. Chem. Soc., 127. 494 1925 .

The second step represented above inEquations 14 a and 14 b involves the formation of 5or 6 membered ring lactones from the corresponding 5or 6 hydroxy carboxylic acids. an extremely facile cyclization which often occurs spontaneously. This lactonization process can be aided by heating the hydroxy acids in the presence of a suitable acid such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid.

Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are some times desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins. et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers . 2nd Ed.. Dorland Books. Caldwell. NewJersey, but other solids. either mined or manufactured. may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden. Solvents Guide. 2nd Ed.. Interscience, New York. 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at OOC.

All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming. caking. corrosion. microbiological growth. etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually. grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example. Littler, U.S. Patent 3.060.084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning. Agglomeration , Chemical Enaineerinq.

Utility Test results indicate that the compounds of the present invention are highly active preemergent or postemergent herbicides or plant growth regulants.Many of them have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired. such as around fuel storage tanks. ammunition depots. industrial storage areas, parking lots, drive in theaters. around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Some of the compounds may be used as selective herbicides in such crops as soybeans. Alternatively, the subject compounds are useful to modify plant growth. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as plant growth modifiers or as herbicides, the crop species involved. the types of weeds to be controlled. weather and climate. formulations selected. mode of application, amount of foliage present. etc. In general terms. the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.01 to 10 kg ha. the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for plant growth modification or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide, examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil. urea. amide. diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow.
