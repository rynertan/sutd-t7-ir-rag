# Frame for film transparency.

## Abstract
A frame 10 is described for mounting a film transparency having leading and trailing ends and spaced parallel sides which surround a picture area. The frame 10 includes first and second members 12, 14 which are adapted for movement between a film transparency loading position shown and an operative position in which they enclose and support the transparency. The frame 10 includes, in the transparency loading position, a pair of laterally spaced open ended guides 36, 38 for slidably receiving the parallel sides of the transparency as it is advanced into its proper relationship relative to the frame, and a pair of surfaces 52, 54 which extend forwardly of the open end 48, 50 of each of the guides and which function to direct the leading end of the transparency into the open end of each of the guides.
