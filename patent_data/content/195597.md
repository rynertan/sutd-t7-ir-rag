## Description
BLEACHING COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING ALKOXY SUBSTITUTED AROMATIC PEROXYACIDS Michael E. Burns BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical Field This invention relates to peroxygen bleaching compositions and processes therefor that provide effective surface bleaching of textiles over a wide range of temperatures. Surface bleaching of textiles is bleaching wherein the bleaching mechanism takes place on the textile surface, and, thereby, removes stains andlor soils.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a bleaching compound providing a peroxyacid of the following general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is an alkyl group containing from about 4 to about 8 carbon atoms. The benzene ring may be additionally substituted with for example, an alkyl group or a chloro or nitro group. Preferred compounds which provide the above peroxyacid are the magnesium salts of the peroxyacid of the following general formulaEMI1.2 wherein R is as defined for the peroxyacid, X is a compatible anion, and n is 1 or 2. The peroxyacids may be formed in situ from the corresponding diacyl peroxides. The peroxyacids may also be formed in situ from a peroxygen bleaching compound capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and a bleach activator of the following formula EMI1.3 wherein R is as defined for the peroxy acid, and L is a leaving group, the conjugate acid of which has a pKa of from about 4 to about 13. The invention also relates to bleaching compositions which contain one of the above compounds. Where the composition contains the bleach activator, another essential component is a peroxygen bleaching compound capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution. In a preferred embodiment, the bleaching compositions are incorporated into detergent compositions. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to bleaching compounds which provide alkoxy substituted aromatic peroxyacids of the following general formula EMI2.1 wherein R is an alkyl group with from about 4 to about 8 carbon atoms, preferably about 5 to about 8 carbon atoms, and most preferably about 6 carbon atoms. The benzene ring may be optionally substituted further as with, e.g., an alkyl group, a chloro or nitro group. The bleaching compounds of the invention provide effective and efficient surface bleaching of textiles which thereby removes stains and or soils from the textiles. The compounds are particularly efficient at removing dingy soils from textiles. Dingy soils are those that build up on textiles after much usage and washing, and result in a gray or yellow tint on a white textile. These soils are a blend of particulate and greasy materials The compounds of the invention provide effective bleaching over a wide range of temperature 50C to 850C , a preferred range being from about 300C to about 60bC. The compounds of the invention perform surprisingly well under full soil load conditions. Alkyl substituted aromatic peroxyacids with comparable chain length substitution do not provide effective bleaching in the presence of soil. In U.S. Patent 4,154,695, McCrudden et al, issued May 15, 1979, and U.S. Patent 4,288,388, McCrudden et al, issued September 8, 1981, both incorporated herein by reference, disclose aromatic peroxyacids for use as bleaching compositions. They specifically disclose aromatic peroxyacids with a further substitution of the benzene ring. Lower alkyl groups are described as a possible substitution, methyl being the only group specifically mentioned. Surprisingly, the C4 C8 alkoxy substituted aromatic peroxyacids provided highly effective bleaching even in the presence of high soil loads, such as those found in many typical consumer wash loads. The peroxyacid may be used directly as a bleaching agent.For improved stability, when incorporated into the bleaching and detergent compositions described hereinafter the magnesium salt of the peroxyacid is preferred. The Magnesium Peroxycarboxylate The magnesium salt has the following general formulaEMI3.1 wherein R is an alkyl group containing from about 4 to about 8, preferably from about 5 to about 8 and most preferably about 6 carbon atoms, X is a compatible anion, n is 1 or 2, and Y is an integer from about 0 to about 6, and preferably from about 2 to about 4. The compounds are solid and possess excellent storage stability, especially under alkaline conditions as when admixed with a detergent composition. Stability means that the solid magnesium peroxycarboxylates retain the active oxygen during storage to a much greater extent than the corresponding peroxyacids. The active oxygen in the magnesium peroxycarboxylate is readily available. This means that the solid magnesium peroxycarboxylates are readily soluble or dispersible and yield solutions containing active oxygen. When the solution is aqueous, it cannot be distinguished from an aqueous solution prepared from the corresponding peroxyacid and an equivalent amount of magnesium, when the solutions are adjusted to the same pH. In addition to excellent storage stability when admixed with detergent compositions the magnesium peroxycarboxylates have a higher safety than the corresponding peroxyacids both in handling purposes and to the substrate. Also the solid magnesium peroxycarboxylates have superior odor, dispersibility and handling properties relative to the corresponding peroxyacid. It is believed that the increased stability of the magnesium salt when used in compositions relative to the primary peroxyacid is due to the fact that the active oxygen atom is nucleophilic rather than electrophilic as it is in the corresponding peroxycarboxylate. Nucleophilic agents which would attack an electrophilic oxygen are much more prevalent in bleaching and detergent compositions than electrophilic agents which would attack a nucleophilic oxygen. The magnesium peroxycarboxylates can be prepared via the process of U.S. Patent 4,483,781, Hartman, issued November 20, 1984, incorporated herein by reference. Hartman discloses magnesium peroxycarboxylates substituted with alkoxy groups of from C1 C5. Applicant has found, contrary to the techings of Hartman that C48 alkoxy substituted aromatic peroxyacids are superior in bleaching performance to the lower alkoxy substituted aromatic peroxyacids. When placed in use with an actual soil load, the shorter chain alkoxy substituted aromatic peroxyacid does not provide effective bleaching. The Bleach Activator The bleach activators within the invention are alkoxy substituted aromatic peroxyacids of the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1 is as defined for the peroxyacid and L is a suitable leaving group. A leaving group is any group that is displaced from the bleach activator as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack on the bleach activator by the perhydroxide anion. This, the perhydrolysis reaction. results in the formation of the peroxycarboxylic acid. Generally, for a group to be a suitable leaving group it must exert an electron attracting effect. It should also form a stable entity so that the rate of the back reaction is negligible. This facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the perhydroxide anion. The L group must be sufficiently reactive for the reaction to occur within the optimum time frame e.g., a wash cycle .However, if L is too reactive, this activator will be difficult to stabilize for use in a bleaching or detergent composition. These characteristics are generally paralleled by the pKa of the conjugate acid of the leaving group, although exceptions to this convention are known. Commonly, leaving groups that exhibit such behavior are those in which their conjugate acid has a pKa in the range of from about 4 to about 13, preferably from about 6 to about 11 and most preferably from about 8 to about 11. Preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R1 is as defined for the peroxy acid and L is selected from the group consisting of EMI5.1 wherein R is as defined above,EMI6.1 tb R1 SEP o4o tb SEP R2 SEP is SEP an SEP alkyl SEP chain tb containing from about 1. to about 8 carbon atoms, R3 is H or R2, and Y is H or a solubilizing group. The preferred solubilizing groups are S03Mt, COOM , SO4M , N n,Yx and 0 t N R2 and most preferably SO 3M and COO M wherein R is an alkyl chain containing from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, M is a cation which provides solubility to the bleach activator and X is an anion which provides solubility to the bleach activator.Preferably, M is an alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium cation, with sodium and potassium being most preferred, and X is a halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate or acetate anion. It should be noted that bleach activators with a leaving group that does not contain a solubilizing group should be well dispersed in the bleaching solution in order to assist in their dissolution. Preferred bleach activators are also those of the above general formula wherein L is as defined in the general formula and R1 is an alkyl group containing about 6 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R1 is an alkyl group containing from about 4 to about 8 carbon atoms and L is selected from the qroup consistinq of EMI6.2 wherein R2 is as defined above and Y is SO3M or COO M wherein M is as defined above. Preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R1 is a linear alkyl chain containing from about 5 to about 8, and most preferably about 6 carbon atoms, and L is selected from the group consisting of EMI6.3 wherein R2 is as defined above and Y is S03M or COO M wherein M is as defined above. The most preferred bleach activators have the formula EMI7.1 wnerein K is a linear aiKyi cnain containing about b carbon atoms and M is sodium or potassium. When the bleach activator is the source of the peroxyacid, optimum bleaching performance is obtained with bleaching solutions wherein the pH of such solution is between about 8.5 and 10.5 and preferably between 9 and 10. It is preferred that such pH be greater than 9 to optimize the rate of perhydrolysis.Such pH can be obtained with substances commonly known as buffering agents, which are optional components of the bleaching compositions herein.The Bleaching Compositions The bleaching compositions of the invention are those which, upon dissolution in aqueous solution, provide a bleaching compound of the formulaEMI7.2 where R is an alkyl group with from about 4 to about 8 carbon atoms, preferably about 5 to about 8 carbon atoms, and most preferably 6 carbon atoms. Such compositions provide extremely effective and efficient surface bleaching of textiles which thereby remove stains and or soils from the textiles. The compositions are particularly effective at removing dingy soils from textiles. Dingy soils are soils that build up on textiles after numerous cycles of usage and washing, and thus, result in a white textile having a gray or yellow tint. These soils tend to be blend of particulate and greasy materials. The removal of this type of soil is sometimes referred to as dingy fabric clean up . The bleaching compositions provide such bleaching over a wide range of bleach solution temperatures. Such bleaching is obtained in bleach solutions wherein the solution temperature is at least about 50C. Inorganic peroxygen bleaches would be ineffective and or impracticable at temperatures below about 600C. The invention relates to compositions comrising a peroxyacid of the formulaEMI8.1 wherein K IS an alkyl group wtth trom abut 4 to about 8 carbon atoms, preferably from about 5 to about 8 carbon atoms, and most preferably about 6 carbon atoms. The invention also relates to compositions comprising a magnesium peroxycarboxylate of the formulaEMI8.2 wherein R is an alkyl group containing from about 4 to about 8, preferably from about 5 to about 8, and most preferably about 6 carbon atoms, X is a compatible anion, n is 1 or 2, and Y is an integer from 0 to about 6, and preferably 2 to about 4. This invention also relates to bleaching compositions containing a peroxygen bleach capable of releasing hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution and bleach activators of the formulaEMI8.3 wherein R is an alkyl group containing from about 4 to about 8, preferably about 5 to about 8, and most preferably 6 carbon atoms. The bleaching mechanism generally, and the surface bleaching mechanism in particular, are not completely understood.However, it is generally believed that the bleach activator undergoes nucleophilic attack by a perhydroxide anion, which is generated from the hydrogen peroxide evolved by the peroxygen bleach, to form a peroxycarboxylic acid. This reaction is commonly referred to as perhydrolysis. A second less desirable reaction involves the formation of the less reactive diacyl peroxide. This reaction increases in consequence with the hydrophobicity of R. While some diacyl peroxide production is desirable in order to improve bleaching of specific stains e.g., spaghetti sauce or barbecue sauce because of the lessened reactivity, conditions are preferred which produce only a small percentage of the diacyl peroxide. It is also believed, that the bleach activators within the invention can render peroxygen bleaches more efficient even at bleach solution temperatures wherein bleach activators are not necessary to activate the bleach1 i.e., above about 600C. Therefore, with bleach compositions of the invention, less peroxygen bleach is required to get the same level of surface bleaching performance as is obtained with the peroxygen bleach alone. The bleaching compositions wherein the bleach activator is used also have, as an essential component a peroxygen bleach capable of releasing hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution. The Peroxygen Bleaching Compound The peroxygen bleaching compounds useful herein are those capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution.These compounds are well known in the art and include hydrogen peroxide and the alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxide bleaching compounds such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalt bleaching compounds, such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, and the like. Mixtures of two or more such bleaching compounds can also be used, if desired. Preferred peroxygen bleaching compounds include sodium perborate, commercially available in the form of mono , tri and tetra hydrates, sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate, sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrate, and sodium peroxide. Particularly preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate and, especially, sodium perborate monohydrate.Sodium perborate monohydrate is especially preferred because it is very stable during storage and yet still dissolves very quickly in the bleaching solution. It is believed that such rapid dissolution results in the formation of higher levels of percarboxylic acid and, thus, enhanced surface bleaching performance. The level of peroxygen bleach within compositions of the invention is from about 0.1 to about 95 and preferably from about 1 to about 608. When the bleaching compositions within the invention are also detergent compositions it is preferred that the level of peroxygen bleach is from about 1 to about 208. The level of bleach activator within the compositions of the invention is from about O.196 to about 60 and preferably from about 0.5 to about 40 . When the bleaching compositions within the invention are also detergent compositions it is preferable that the level of bleach activator is from about .5 to about 20 , more preferably from about 2 to about 8 . Optional Components As a preferred embodiment, the bleaching compositions of the invention can be detergent compositions. Thus, the bleaching compositions can contain typical detergent composition components such as detergency surfactants and detergency builders. In such preferred embodiments the bleaching compositions are particularly effective.

To a slurry of sodium p phenolsulfonic acid dihydrate 250 g, 1.08 mol in 200 mL distilled water was added 43.0 g 1.08 mol of sodium hydroxide as a 50.5 solution. The resulting slurry was evaporated on a rotary evaporator to yield a hard, white solid. This solid was dried to constant weight in a convection oven at 150 OC to yield 229 g 97 of the anhydrous disodium salt. To a suspension of 45.2 g 0.207 mol of the above anhydrous disodium salt of p phenolsulfonic acid, in 250 mL ethylene glycol dimethyl ether was added in one portion a solution of 50.0 g 0.207 mol of 4 hexyloxybenzoyl chloride in 50 mL ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. The resulting stirred suspension was refluxed under nitrogen for 3 hours, cooled, filtered, and the collected solid washed with diethyl ether.The resulting solid was stirred with 200 mL water, filtered, and washed with water.The solid was then stirred with 150 mL methanol, filtered, and washed with methanol. Vacuum drying afforded 64.2 g 78 of sodium 4 hexyloxybenzoyloxybenzenesulfonate as an off white solid. EXAMPLE II Preparation of sodium 4 butoxybenzoyloxybenzenesulfonate. The general procedure described in Example I was followed.Anhydrous p phenolsulfonic acid, disodium salt 51.2 g., 0.235 mol , 4 butoxybenzoyl chloride 50.0 g, 0.235 mol , and 250 mL ethylene glycol dimethyl ether were refluxed under nitrogen for 4 hours. The resulting mixture was cooled in an ice bath, filtered, and the collected solid washed with diethyl ether. The crude solid 85.6 g was stirred with 150 mL ice cold water, filtered, and washed with ice cold water. While still on the filter the solid was washed with three 25 mL portions of ice cold methanol. Yield after vacuum drying was 56.0 g of white solid.The NMR spectrum dimethyl d6 sulfoxide solvent showed that the solid consisted of 95 sodium 4 butoxybenzoyloxybenzenesulfonate and 5 sodium p phenolsulfonate. The yield of purified sodium 4 butoxybenzoyloxybenzenesu I fonate was 61 . EXAMPLE Ill Preparation of blend of sodium 4 hexyloxybenzoyloxybenzenesulfonate with sodium sulfate and sodium linear alkylbenzene sulfonate LAS . A weight of 11.8 g of 85 active C1t 6 LAS was dissolved in 50 mL water and the pH adjusted to 7.0 with 0.1 N sulfuric acid.This solution was blended with 40.0 g of sodium 4 hexyloxybenzoyloxybenzenesulfonate powdered and passed through 24 mesh and 100.0 g of powdered sodium sulfate. The resulting paste was then dried under vacuum, powdered, and passed through 24 mesh to yield a rapidly soluble composition containing 26.4 sodium 4 hexyloxybenzoyloxybenzenesul fonate. EXAMPLE IV Perhydrolysis of sodium 4 hexyloxybenzoyloxybenzenesulfonate to form 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid. A detergent granule having the following composition was prepared 8 Sodium C13 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate 8.5 Sodium C14 15 alkyl sulfate 8.5 C12 13 alkyl polyethoxylate6 5 2.3 C12 alkyl trimethylammonium chloride 1.1 Sodium tripolyphosphate 36.4 8 Sodium carbonate 13.6 Sodium silicate 5.7 Sodium sulfate 11.7 Moisture 8.5 Minor ingredients 3.6 A 4 liter flask was equipped with a magnetic stirrer and charged with 4 L of 950F city water, 5.00 g of the above detergent granules, 0.21 g of sodium perborate monohydrate, and 0.89 g of the composition described in Example Ill. The resulting solution was stirred, aliquots withdrawn at various time intervals, and the aliquots analyzed for organic peroxyacid by a conventional iodometric method.This method consisted of pouring the solution aliquot onto ice, acidification of the resulting mixture with acetic acid, addition df potassium iodide solution, and titration of the liberated iodine with sodium thiosulfate solution.The volume of sodium thiosulfate solution required was then used to calculate the concentration in solution of available oxygen AvO due to the formation of organic peroxyacid. The concentration of AvO was then used to calculate the concentration of 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid. Tabulated below are the results obtained for the above experiment. 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid Time t Peroxyacid AvO Concentration of theoretical min. ppm in ppm yield 2 0.56 8.35 23 7 1.17 17.4 49 12 1.37 20.4 57 20 1.60 23.8 67 EXAMPLE V Preparation of Li hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid.4 Hexyloxybenzoyl chloride Thionyl chloride 485 g of 98 , 4.00 mol was added dropwise to 300 g t .35 mol of 4 hexyloxybenzoic acid. The resulting mixture was refluxed under nitrogen for 2 hours.Distillation yielded 318 g 98 of 4 hexyloxybenzoyl chloride boiling point 149 153 C 7.5 mm j. 4 Hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid Sodium hydroxide 16.6 g of 508, 0.208 mol , hydrogen peroxide 7.9 g of 988, 0.208 mol , magnesium sulfate 0.20 g, 1.66 mmol , water 65 mL , and dioxane 225 mL were combined in a one liter beaker equipped with a magnetic stirrer. To the resulting stirred solution was added 4 hexyloxybenzoyl chloride 10. 0 g, 0.0415 mol dropwise over a 5 minute period. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 1 4 hours, poured into 150 mL 208 sulfuric acid, and the peroxyacid extracted into 200 mL methylene chloride. The methylene chloride solution was washed with water and dried over sodium sulfate analysis seeExample IV of the dry solution indicated a yield of peroxyacid of 60 . The methylene chloride solution was evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator to 9.6 g of a white solid. This solid was stirred with 50 mL of warm heptane and the resulting suspension filtered to yield 6.7 g of 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid AvO 5,468, theoretical AvO 6.71 . This material was further purified by recrystallization from heptane to give a first crop of 1.9 g of colorless needles which was discarded and a second crop of 3.6 g of colorless needles having an AvO as peroxyacid 6,038 and melting point 47 52 C. Analysis of this second crop for both peroxyacid AvO and diacylperoxide AvO see Organic Peroxides Ed. D. Sworn , Vol. I, Wily lnterscience, New York, 1970, p.501 indicated that this material was a 90 10 mixture of 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid and 4,4 dihexyloxybenzoyl peroxide. EXAMPLE Vl Preparation of the magnesium salt of 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid. A dispersion of magnesium hydroxide 4.20 mmol was prepared by dissolving magnesium sulfate 0.505 g, 4.20 mmol 20 ml water and adding 8.4 mmol of 1 N sodium hydroxide 0.336 g, 8.40 mmol . To this stirred dispersion was added in one portion a solution of 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid 2.00 g, 8.40 mmol in 30 mL ethyl acetate. The resulting mixture was stirred for 15 minutes and the precipitated solid collected by filtration and washed with water and then ethyl acetate. Air drying afforded 1.9 g of magnesium bis 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoate , AvO seeExample IV 4.58 , melting point decomposes at from 90 2100C, liquifies at from 210 2200C. EXAMPLE VII Bleaching performance of 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid. In this Example 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid was formed during the washing cycle by the reaction of sodium 4 hexyloxybenzoyloxybenzene sulfonate with hydrogen peroxide from sodium perborate monohydrate in the presence of the detergent granules described in Example IV. Bleaching performance was determined by comparing the fabric whitening and stain removal of this treatment with a treatment containing only the detergent granule.Thus, to each of two top loading automatic washing machines was added 5 Ibs. of naturally soiled ballast fabrics and 68 liters of 950F city water having a hardness of 6 gr gal. To one machine was added 89 g of the detergent granules described in ExampleIV, and to a second machine was added 89 g of this same detergent granule, 6.1 g of sodium perborate monohydrate, and 27.0 g of a composition like that described in Example Ill and containing 22.7 of sodium 4 hexyloxybenzoyloxybenzene sulfonate. The wash solution in this second machine thus contained concentrations of 90 ppm of both sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium 4 hexyloxybenzoyloxybenzene sulfonate. To each of the above wash solutions were added two sets of naturally soiled white fabrics and two sets of artificially stained swatches. The washing machines were then allowed to complete their normal washing and rinsing cycles, and the ballast and test fabrics were dryer dried. This procedure was repeated three times, using different sets of ballast fabrics, naturally soiled white fabrics and artificially stained swatches for each replicate. After completion of the three replicates, the fabrics and swatches were arranged under suitable lighting for comparison of soil and stain removal. Three expert graders compared the extent of removal of the soils and stains using the following scale 0 no difference between two swatches thought to be a difference 2 certain of a difference 3 certain of a large difference 4 certain of a very large difference In this grading the naturally soiled white fabrics were compared for improvement in whiteness, and the artificially stained swatches were compared for removal of the stain The grades obtained were then averaged and normalized to yield the results shown below.Also tabulated below are the percentage of grades for each fabric or swatch type where the treatment containing sodium 4 hexyloxybenzoyloxybenzene sulfonate and sodium perborate monohydrate was superior to the detergent alone treatment by a score of 2 or more on the above scale.

Measurements of bleaching performance were conducted with 7.6 liter solutions in 950F water containing 5 gr gal hardness as 3 1 molar Ca 2 Mg 2. The performance of solutions containing 1250 ppm of the detergent granule, 90 ppm of sodium perborate monohydrate, and 90 ppm of a sodium 4 alkyloxybenzoyloxybenzene sulfonate were compared with a solution containing 1250 ppm of the detergent granule alone.These comparisons were made also where the ballast load in each solution was 200 g of clean terrycloth and also where the ballast load consisted of 100 g of naturally soiled T shirt material plus 100 g of naturally soiled pillowcases. The soiled fabrics and stained swatches were the same as employed in Example VII. The washed fabrics and swatches were graded in a round robin fashion and the relative performance of the various treatments was calculated by standard methods. The results obtained are tabulated below. These results demonstrate that the bleaching performance of the 4 alkyloxyperoxybenzoic acids is relatively unaffected by the presence of soil.

The treatment containing 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid consisted of 89 g of the detergent granule described in Example IV, 3.6 g of sodium perborate monohydrate, 15.3 g of a composition like that of Example Ill and containing 26.7 of sodium z 4 hexy 4 hexyloxybenzoyoxybenzene sulfonate, and 0.6 g of an enzyme composition containing protease and having an activity of 2.2 Anson units. The resulting wash solution thus contained 52.5 ppm of sodium perborate monohydrate and 60 ppm of sodium 4 hexyloxybenzoyloxybenzene sulfonate.The bleaching performance of this treatment was compared with a treatment that contained 89 g of the base granule alone. The results obtained are tabulated below. The odors of both the wash solutions and the wet fabrics from the treatments that contained 4 hexyloxyperoxybenzoic acid were evaluated by an expert perfumer this evalution indicated a complete absence of the malodors that are frequently associated with the use of peroxyacid bleaches.
