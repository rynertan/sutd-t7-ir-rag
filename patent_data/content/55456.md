# Multi lamp photoflash unit and fabricating process.

## Abstract
A multi lamp photoflash unit includes a housing mem ber having a plurality of spaced cavities in a back portion and a light transmittable front portion formable to enclose the cavities, a reflector unit having a multiplicity of spaced cavities formed to nest in the cavities of the housing member, and an aperture extending through the reflector unit and housing member to provide venting from the cavities to the exterior of the housing member. Also, the multi lamp photoflash unit is fabricated by a process which includes the forming of a housing member having a back portion with a plurality of spaced cavities and a foldable light transmitting front portion, a reflector unit having a multiplicity of spaced cavities formed to nest in the cavities of the housing member and an aperture for venting the reflector unit cavities to the exterior of the housing member.
