# COMPONENT STATE MONITORING

## Abstract
Apparatus suitable for use with an operative system for monitoring the operational state of at least one system component such as a hydraulic valve, which can adopt three possible states. The apparatus includes a state signal generator for operative association with the component and is responsive to the state of the component. The apparatus generates a first steady state signal whenever the compo nent is in a first state, a second steady state signal when the component is in a second state and a time varying signal such as a square wave when the component is in a third state. A two pole switch 40 connected to the component is connected to one of the inputs of each of two gates 41 , 42 the other input of gate 41 being connected to a square wave generator 43 and the other input of gate 42 being connected to the output of gate 41 . The output from gate 42 is only a square wave signal when the switch and the component are in an intermediate position.
