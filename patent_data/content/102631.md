# Nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
A nuclear reactor is equipped with a cooling water circulation system 2 which includes a water feed conduit and a drain conduit 5 to circulate the cooling water to and from a pressure vessel 12 which surrounds a reactor core 1 , the cooling water having a free liquid level 13 main tained above the reactor core 1 . The drain conduit 5 is inserted in the pressure vessel 12 from the upper side toward the lower side relative to free liquid level 13 . A double tube 11 consisting of an inner tube 10 and an outer tube 14 maintaining a gap therebetween is formed in the end portion of the drain conduit 5 . The inner tube 10 and outer tube 14 being continuous with the drain conduit 5 , the opening 7 at the lower end of the inner tube 10 is located below said free liquid level 13 but above the reactor core 1 . The opening 15 at the upper end of the outer tube 14 is located above free liquid level 13 . The opening 16 at the lower end of said outer tube 14 is located below the reactor core 1 .
