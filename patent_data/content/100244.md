# PIPE PROTECTORS

## Abstract
A pipe protector 1 having a top wall and at least one side wall 7, 8 can be fitted over the end of a pipe to protect it during transit. The pipe protector is substantially annular but has a small gap 2 and means to vary the distance between the two ends 3, 4 . The means may be in the form of a spring 5 or clamp, or an inverted tooth wedge if the gap is to be increased. Alternatively or additionally there may be tangs, dimples or pro jections 6 on at least one of the inner surfaces of the top wall or side wall to improve resistance to accidental removal of the pipe protector.
