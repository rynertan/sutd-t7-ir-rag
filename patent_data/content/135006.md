# HYGROSCOPIC BREATHER CAP

## Abstract
The hygroscopic breather cap for a fluid such as a liquid petroleum tank 18 in which air enters the bottom of an elongated cylinder, passes through a knitted fabric filter 24 to remove dust particles, passes through a desiccant 25 along the entire height of the cylinder to remove moisture, passes through a second knitted fabric filter to remove desiccant fines, and then passes into the opening of a standpipe 16 for passage downwardly along the axis of the cylinder into the petroleum tank 18 . A window may be provided in the top cylinder 10 to view the condition of the desiccant, or alternatively, the body of the cylinder may be made transparent. A number of reduced strength areas may be provided at the bottom of the cylinder so that the effective size of the opening to the atmosphere may be selectively varied. A removable cap 14 permits a recharging of the cylinder with desiccant 25 .
