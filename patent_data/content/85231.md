# Catalyst composition, production and use.

## Abstract
A titanium containing composition is obtained by con tacting a magnesium halide with a non metallic halide such as thionyl chloride, for example by grinding, and contacting the product with a titanium tetrachloride containing material, preferably undiluted liquid titanium tetrachloride. The treat ment with titanium tetrachloride may be effected by milling or by suspending the solid in the titanium tetrachloride. The solid product can be washed at least once. An ester is preferably contacted with the magnesium halide. The pro duct obtained may be used with an organic metal compound such as aluminium triethyl and preferably a Lewis Base such as ethyl benzoate or an organic silicon compound to give olefin polymerisation catalyst. When used to polymerise propylene the product obtained is highly stereoregular and the level of residual catalyst is low.
