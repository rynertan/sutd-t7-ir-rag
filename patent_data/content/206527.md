# Method for producing sintered silicon carbide products.

## Abstract
A method for producing wear resistant sintered silicon carbide products characterized in that 99 top 50 wt. of β phase SiC having an average particle diameter of not more than 1 µ is mixed with 10 to 50 wt. of α SiC having an average particle diameter which is not more than 1 µ but not less than 1.5 times as large as that of β SiC tar pitch and a boron source are added as densification aids to the powdery SiC mixture, the amount of tar pitch being such that the total carbon content of the above SiC powdery mixture and the tar pitch is 4 wt. to 8 wt. , and that of the boron source being 0.03 wt. to 0.15 wt. calculated as boron , based on the SiC powdery mixture the resulting mixture is molded and the molded product is then sintered in a vacuum or inert atmosphere.
