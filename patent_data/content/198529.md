## Description
The invention relates to a digital chrominance signal processing circuit an input of which is coupled at least European Patent Application 0 067 899 discloses a digital chrominance signal processing circuit of the above described type, whose stable oscillator in the form of a crystal oscillator produces a signal of four times the chrominance sub carrier frequency. The digital to analogue converter converts a digital value which is a measure of the phase deviation of the crystal oscillator relative to a colour synchronizing signal in a chrominance signal to be processed, into an analogue control signal for the crystal oscillator. When such a chrominance signal processing cir cuit is to be applied in a colour television receiver which must be suitable for processing different types of signals, such as, for example, PAL and NTSC, the quiescent frequency of the stable oscillator must be switchable, which implies that a plurality of different crystals must be available for the crystal oscillator. The invention has for its object to provide a chrominance signal processing circuit in which one fre quency of the stable oscillator and in the case of a crystal oscillator consequently only one crystal is suffi cient. According to the invention, a digital chrominance signal processing circuit of the type defined in the ope ning paragraph, is characterized in that the control signal input of the oscillator circuit is coupled Since the quiescent frequency of the digital os cillator can be selected by applying a suitably chosen digital number to the further input of the adder circuit, there is no need to change the frequency of the stable oscillator, which is usually constituted by a crystal oscillator, for changing the quiescent frequency. In ad dition to the fact that a cheaper construction of a multi standard receiver is possible, this means that, as regards the oscillator circuit, the manufacturer needs only keep one type of crystal in stock for different types of single standard receivers, when these receivers are equipped with a digital chrominance signal processing circuit ac cording to the invention. Furthermore, the stable oscilla tor may now have a frequency which is also suitable for another function in the receiver, such as, for example, processing the teletext signal, tuning, or writing or reading memories. The invention will now be described with greater detail by way of example with reference to the accompany ing drawing, the only Figure of which illustrates by means of a block diagram a chrominance signal processing circuit according to the invention. In the Figure, an analogue colour television signal to be processed, which in this case contains a chrominance signal, a luminance signal and a synchronizing signal is applied to an input 1 of an analogue to digital converter 3. A digital colour television signal which is applied to an input 7 of a separating circuit 9 is obtain ed from an output 5 of the analogue to digital converter 3. The separating circuit 9 separates the different components of the colour television signal and supplies from an output 11 the luminance signal Y, from an output 13 the digital chrominance signal CHR and from an output 15 the synchronizing signal S. The output 13 of the sepa rating circuit 9 is connected to an input 17 of a digital chrominance signal demodulation circuit 19 of which a re ference signal input 21, as is also a sampling signal input 23 of the analogue to digital converter 3, is connected to an output 25 of an oscillator circuit 27. The output 25 of the oscillator circuit 27 produces a pulse signal of four times the chrominance subcarrier frequency. The demodulation circuit 19 has a first and a second quadrature component demodulator 29 and 31, respect ively, whose respective inputs 33 and 35 are connected to the input 17 of the demodulation circuit 19, respective reference signal inputs 37 and 39 to first and second out puts 41 and 43, respectively of a reference signal pro cessing circuit 45 an input 47 of which is connected to the reference signal input 21 of the demodulation circuit 19. Outputs 49 and 51, respectively of the respective first and second quadrature component demodulators 29 and 31 are connected to respective first and second outputs 53 and 55 of the demodulation circuit 19 and supplies therefrom a demodulated digital first and second quadra ture component U and V, respectively. These components U and V are also applied to an input 57 and 59, respecti vely of a colour synchronizing signal processing circuit 61, which has a gate signal input 63 to which the synchro nizing signal S obtained from the output 15 of the separat ing circuit is applied. In a circuit for processing a PAL chrominance signal it is further possible, in known manner, that there is a coupling, denoted by means of a broken line, between the colour synchronizing signal processing circuit 61 and the reference signal processing circuit 45 for obtaining the appropriate phase change of the reference signal for the demodulator 31 for the V component. The oscillator circuit 27 comprises a stable oscillator 65 which is in the form of a crystal oscillator and oscillates independently of the chrominance signal at a frequency f The digital number at the output 83 of the adder circuit 85 is the sum of a number Consequently, the digital number The digital oscillator 71 comprises a modulo one adder 103, an input 105 of which is connected to the input 73 of the digital oscillator 71 and a further input 107 is connected to an output 111 of the modulo one adder 103 The output 101 of the digital oscillator 71 is connected to the output 111 of the modulo one adder 103 and applies the output signal of the digital oscillator 71 to an input 113 of a read only memory ROM 115 which converts the sawtooth shaped signal at its input 113 into a sinusoidal signal at its output 117, which signal is applied to an input 119 of a digital to analogue converter 121. An output 123 of the digital to analogue con verter 121 applies a predominantly sinusoidal signal at the frequency 4f The control loop which leads from the control signal output 91 of the chrominance signal demodulation circuit 19 The output signal of the crystal oscillator 65 can further be taken from an output 137 of the oscillator circuit 27, for example for use as a clock signal for a teletext display circuit or as a clock signal for a micro processor. If so desired, the frequency f When the luminance signal Y is not conveyed It will be obvious that the connections shown in the Figure may be multiple connections, depending on the number of bits to be conveyed through them, when a digital signal is involved. The control signal at the control signal output 91 of the chrominance signal demo dulation circuit 19 can, for example, be transmitted in twenty bits, the output signal of the circuit 99 may have twenty four bits, the signal at the input 73 of the digital oscillator 71 twenty four bits, the signal at the output 101 thereof ten bits, the signal at the output 117 of the read only memory 115 may contain, for example, seven bits and the signal at the output 5 of the analogue to digital converter 3 may have seven bits. If a modulo n adder is used as the adder 103, the numbers applied to the adder circuit 85 must be If so desired, the digital oscillator 71 may be of any other appropriate structure, possibly producing a waveform other than a sawtooth, when the circuit ope rates in a manner similar to the manner described in the foregoing. The limiter circuit 133 may be omitted when the oscillator of the filter circuit 127 in the form of a phase locked loop produces a signal suitable for use as a clock signal. The chrominance signal demodulation circuit 19, may, for example, be of a known construction, the mode of operation of such circuits may be assumed to be suffi ciently known.
