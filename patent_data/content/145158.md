# Bubble oxygenator.

## Abstract
A bubble oxygenator for oxygenating blood in an extracorporeal circuit. The oxygenator is formed from three concentric shells 12,32,52 which define an oxygenating chamber, a defoaming chamber and an arterial reservoir. The arterial reservoir includes a view chamber 58 which permits visual inspection of the level of blood held in the arterial reservoir. The outer shell 52 which forms the arterial reservoir is rotatable with respect to the remainder of the apparatus so that the view chamber can be easily positioned for observation.
