# Method of magnetic brush development.

## Abstract
A method of electrophotography in which an electro static latent image is formed on the surface of a material layer 1 and a non magnetic cylinder 3 is provided to confront the surface of said material layer 1 . A perma nent magnet roll 2 made up of a plurality of symmetri cally arranged magnetic poles extends axially in said cy linder 3 . A magnetic brush is formed by attracting a semiconducting or insulating magnetic toner 4 onto the cylinder 3 with the aid of a magnetic attraction force of the permanent magnet roll 2 . The cylinder 3 and the permanent magnet roll 2 are moved relative to each other to permit the magnetic brush to slide along the surface of the material layer 1 thereby to allow the magnetic toner 4 to adhere at predetermined positions on the surface of said material layer 1 , and a toner image is transferred onto a transferring member and is then subjected to fixing. The cylinder 3 and the permanent magnet roll 2 are rotated in the same direction so that the magnetic toner 4 is moved in the same direction as that of said material layer 1 at a speed less than 100 mm sec irrespective of the speed of movement of the surface of said material layer 1 at a development section.
