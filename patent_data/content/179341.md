# Method and apparatus for remotely monitoring a process carried out in a containment structure.

## Abstract
A rod position indicating system for a pressurized water reactor generates within containment redundant sets of digital detector signals and applies both sets to each of two communications buses each controlled by a separate bus controller serial output device located inside of containment. A pair of redundant serial data links transmits the redundant data from each bus controller serial output device through containment to a dedicated CRT display and the plant computer each of which generates rod position displays from redundant information selected from one of the data links. The data for each rod is selected individually from the redundant signals received on the one data link. Rod position is presented in bargraph form on a multi page display which includes overall status information along with the detailed presentations.
