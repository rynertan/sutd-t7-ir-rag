# Method for the production of a composite material.

## Abstract
A method for the production of a composite material formed from comminuted particles including blending the particles and a suitable adhesive, forming the blend into a mat, and compressing the mass by at most about 65 per cent. In related aspects, the particles have a defined divers ity of thicknesses, adhesive is used in an amount less than about six percent by weight, and the material is compressed to have a void volume of at least about 10 percent.
