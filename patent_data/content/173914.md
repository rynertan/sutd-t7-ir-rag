# Spool type flow adjusting valve.

## Abstract
A spool type flow adjusting valve, for use in a die casting machine, including a valve bore and a valve spool slidably positioned therein. The spool is driven to axially reciprocate by a pulse motor by means of a transmission of a ball screw type. The bore forms first and second chambers divided by the spool and has a flow inlet and a flow outlet, while the spool has an axial rod extending through the second chamber to the transmission and has one or more through holes communicating the first and second chambers and a circumferential groove communicating with the through holes. When the valve is opened, two flow passages are formed in the valve communicating the flow inlet and outlets, one through the first chamber and the other through the first chamber, the through holes and the groove. The ratio of cross sectional areas of the through holes in total to the cross sectional area of the spool is set to a value large enough to have a thrust acting on the spool in the direction of valve opening decreased as the degree of valve opening is increased from zero and have a direction of the thrust changed at a specific degree from the valve opening direction to the valve closing direction. When an abnormal accident, where the spool is free from control of positioning the spool, occurs during the casting operation, the spool is forced to return automatically to the specific degree by the resultant thrust.
