# Method and apparatus for aligning oval cigarette filters.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for taking rod shaped articles of oval cross section, such as oval filter plugs P for cigarettes, from a hopper, and for presenting the articles at a destination with a predetermined orientation. A plug drum 20 having paraxial flutes at its periphery shaped to accept sin gle oval filter plugs in any angular orientation is used to remove the filter plug from the hopper. When each filter plug is released from the plug drum, it drops through a guideway preferably de fined by two cooperating elements 34, 36 , which permit it to pass through only with a specific orientation. At the discharge end of the guideway is preferably a second drum 38 , which has flutes shaped to accept a filter plus leaving the guideway only in the desired final orientation.
