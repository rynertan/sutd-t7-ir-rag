# Process for regenerating soybeans.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to the regeneration of soybeans. The process comprises the steps of a culturing tissue obtained from a soybean plant on a first medium comprising mineral salts, vitamins, sucrose and a hormone in an amount sufficient to ensure callus and embryoid formation b subculturing the embryoids on a second medium comprising mineral salts, vitamins, sucrose and a hormone in an amount sufficient to ensure embryoid maturation c subculturing the embryoids on a third medium comprising mineral salts, vitamins, sucrose and a hormone in an amount sufficient to ensure shoot formation, and d subculturing the shoots on a fourth medium com prising mineral salts, vitamins and sucrose in an amount sufficient to ensure root formation.
