# Latexes of encapsulated vinylidene chloride copolymer particles.

## Abstract
Improved aqueous vinylidene chloride copolymer latexes are provided in which the dispersed polymer particles are heterogeneous and comprise from 35 to 75 weight percent of polymerized vinylidene chloride and contain a major amount of a soft copolymer core comprising vinylidene chloride and an aliphatic conjugated diene and a minor amount of a polymeric shell which encompasses the core portion and which consists essentially of a an aliphatic conjugated diene, a monovinylidene aromatic monomer or a saturated aliphatic ester of monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids b optionally, up to 40 weight percent based upon the shell of vinylidene chloride and c optionally, up to 10 weight percent based upon such shell of a monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid. These latexes have good heat and light stability and are useful as paper coatings, in carpet backsizing and in nonwoven fabrics.
