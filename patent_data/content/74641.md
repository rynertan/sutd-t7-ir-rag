# Automatic method and apparatus for stopping loom rotation at a constant crank angle.

## Abstract
For ideal stoppage of loom rotation at a constant crank angle, initiation of braking action on loom rotation is always automatically and properly timed on the basis of initial stop lag angle representative of the current braking function so that the resultant actual stop angle should match the preselected stop crank angle and, more particularly, the initial stop lag angle is renewed to cover gradual deteriora tion in the braking function.
