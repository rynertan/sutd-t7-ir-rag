# Observation chamber for a powdered material.

## Abstract
Observation chamber 1 comprising a cylindrical chamber 2 for containing and guiding a flow of powdered material put in for analysis, a tube 4 that passes rectilinearly through the top wall of the cylindrical chamber 2 extending into said chamber 2 parallel to its longitudinal axis A A and carrying into it a flow of powdered material conveyed by comoressed gas, a number of compressed gas ejectors 6 placed around the above tube 4 and having outlets into the cylindrical chamber 2 set back in relation to the outlet of the tube inside the cylindrical chamber 2 in such a way that the compressed gas carried by the ejectors 6 enters upstream of the entry point of the material brought into the cylindrical chamber 2 by the above tube and comprising a number of apertures 9 , in the cylindrical chamber 2 , above the zone traversed by the analysing beam R R , communicating with a source of compressed gas for injecting into the chamber 2 an equivalent number of jets of gas.
