# SERIAL AND PARALLEL INTERFACE DEVICE

## Abstract
An interface device 110 for converting serial data to parallel data and vice versa is disclosed. The interface de vice 110 is comprised of a plurality of storage elements SE electrically interconnected into an array 113 having an equal number of rows and columns. Each storage ele ment comprises a storage device 116 and two switching devices 117, 118 for selectively applying data from one of two inputs A, E of the storage element SE to the storage device 116 . As a result, data can be shifted through the ar ray either along rows or along columns. The data, for a se rial to parallel conversion, is shifted either along rows or columns of the array and is removed from the array, either one parallel word per time, one bit per each column of the array, or one parallel word per time, one bit per each row of the array. For a parallel to serial conversion, parallel data is applied sequentially to the array, either one bit per row or one bit per column of the array. This data is then removed from the array in a serial fashion either one bit stream per each column of the array or one bit stream per each row of the array.
