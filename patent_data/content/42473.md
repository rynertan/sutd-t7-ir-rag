# Method and device for neel wall segment polarity detection in a cross tie memory system.

## Abstract
A method and device for detecting polarity of a Neel wall segment in a cross tie memory system 10 involves ap plying a magnetic field of a given polarity to a Neel wall segment 18B of unknown polarity so that the Neel wall segment expands into a transverse domain 22 , if the magnetic field is applied in the same direction. The presence or absence of the transverse domain is then sensed with a magnetoresistive detector 24 , located to one side of the Neel wall 18B of unknown polarity segment.
