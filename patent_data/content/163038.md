# Centrifugal analyzer rotors.

## Abstract
A multicuvette rotor for use in a centrifugal analyzer defines a circumferential array of elongated radially extend ing cuvettes. Each elongated cuvette defines a first chamber for receiving a first reactant and a loading port through which the first reactant is introduced into the first chamber region, a second chamber region for receiving a second reactant and a loading port through which the second reactant is introduced into the second chamber region, and divider structure between the first and second chamber regions that has a ramp surface and a ramp crest spaced from the ceiling surface of the cuvette so that a transfer passage between the first and second chamber regions is defined through which the first reactant may be flowed into the second chamber region for forming a reaction product with the second reactant. Deflector structure extends down wardly from the cuvette ceiling surface adjacent each second loading port, each deflector structure being located radially outwardly from a line extension of the ramp surface and having a lower end substantially in alignment with the ramp crest. An analysis region is defined adjacent the radially outer wall of the cuvette where the resulting reaction product is subjected to analyses.
