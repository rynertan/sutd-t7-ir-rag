## Description
Integrated circuit information processor This invention relates to information processing and more particularly to an integrated circuit information processor in which special information processing is effected. In general, data processing operations are effected by an operating unit. For example, logic operations and arithmetic operations are executed by an arithmetic logic unit ALU . However, when special data processing is required, even though it may be simple data processing, the ALU requires a relatively long processing time. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, when upper bits and lower bits of an 8 bit input data ao a7 are cross shifted by an operating circuit of the prior art, the shift operation of a7 is effected as follows Shift left bit x 7 times Answer A7 Prepare a mask data B7 10000000 ... 1 A7 A B7 save the answer RIn this operation 1 , 9 steps are required. Further the shift operation of a6 is carried out as follows Shift left 1 bit x 5 times Answer A6 Prepare a mask data B6 01000000 A6 A B6 Answer C1 R v C1 save the answer R In the operation 2 , 8 steps are required. The above operations are carried out in sequence.Finally the shift operation of ao is carried out as follows Shift right 1 bit x 7 times Answer Ao Prepare a mask data Bo 00000001 Ao A BO Answer C7 ... 3 R which is saved in al shifted operation C7 Answer RIn the operation 3 , 10 steps are required. As mentioned above, to complete all the shift operations and achieve the answer R shown in the operation 3 , 55 steps are required. Further in another example shown in Fig. 2, the result of the logical AND of the input data A with the input data B bit by bit is obtained. The fourth bit of the result C of the AND operation remains as the fourth bit of the input data A. When such operation is carried out using prior art operating units, the following steps are required. A A B Answer C Prepare a mask data D 11110111 C A D Answer E Prepare a mask data F 000010000 ... 4 A A F Answer G E v G Answer R Final result In the operation 4 , 6 steps are required. As these examples show, when an operation requiring the shifting of bit positions of data is performed with prior art operating units, complicated processing sequences and longer operating times are required. A prior art shift circuit is described in 16 bitCMOS NMOS SOS microprocessor in microcomputer study material 14, page 7, Jan. 26, 1981 by Jun IWAMURA.In the circuit, a barrel shifter effects right or left operations with the desired number of bits. However the cross shift operation with the desired number of bits cannot be effected. The invention has been intended in view of the above deficiencies, and accordingly one object of this invention is to provide a novel integrated circuit information processor which can easily effect higher speed data processing operations such as is necessary with shifting operations. According to the invention, the desired lines of the input data bus line and the desired lines of the output data bus line are connected through a transfer gate and the bit data of the input data bus line is transferred to the desired bit positions of the output data bus lines by turning on the transfer gate. To achieve the above object, there is provided an information processing device, comprising input data bus, electrically connected to said device, including an input line output data bus, electrically connected to said device, including an output line and transfer means electrically connected to said device, said input data bus and said output data bus, for directly transferring input data from said input line to said output line. A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is an illustration of a prior art method of shifting 8 bit data Fig. 2 is an illustration of another prior art method for shifting 8 bit data Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram of one embodiment of the present invention Fig. 4 is a circuit diagram of another embodiment of the present invention Figs. SA and 5B are illustrations of other prior art methods for shifting 8 bit data and Fig. 6 is a circuit diagram of another embodiment of the present invention. Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and more particularly to Fig. 3 thereof, a circuit diagram of one embodiment of an integrated circuit information processor according to the present invention is shown.The circuit is designed for effecting data processing as shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 3, input data bus line to through t7 and output data bus lines Lo through L7 are connected through transfer gates 1, such as an FET Field Effect Transistor such that the respective bit positions of the input data bus line to through l7 correspond to the respective output data bus lines L7 through to. Each of the transfer gates 1 is connected to the signal wire 2 which provides an enable signal to all of the transfer gates 1, simultaneously.Thus, when an enable signal is applied to the signal line 2, the input data ao through a7 can be easily transferred at a high speed as the output data r7 through ro, respectively, of the output data bus line.The enable signal is generated according to instructions from a microprogram stored in the processor if the microprocessor is of the type having microprogram instruction , or from a user program which directly controls the microprocessor. Referring now to Fig. 4, a circuit for another embodiment of the integrated circuit information processor according to the present invention is shown.The circuit in Fig. 4 is prepared for effecting the data processing shown in Fig. 2. The data A and B of the input data bus lines are applied to a logic circuit 3, such as the arithmetic logic unit ALU of the processor or other similar circuitry which effects AND operation of the respective bits of the input data A and B and outputs the result through a bus driver 4 to an output data bus line C. On the other hand, the line t4 corresponding to the fourth bit of the input data bus line A counting from the lower bits and the lineL4 corresponding to the fourth bit of the output data bus line C are connected through a transfer gate 5, which is controlled by a signal line 6.When a transfer signal is produced from a control circuit 7 having control structure such as that used in the T 88000 manufactured by Toshiba Corporation in Kawasaki, JAPAN, or the control structures of any other processors well known in the art, the transfer signal is inverted by an inverter 8 and is applied to the bus driver 4 to inhibit the output of data to line L4, corresponding to the fourth bit of the output data bus line C, from the output data produced by the logic circuit 3 through the bus driver 4. This is simply accomplished by an AND gate which inhibits output to line L4 whenever there is a bus enable signal to the bus driver and a transfer signal from the control circuit 7. Further, the transfer signal turns on the transfer gate 5 to transfer the data a4 of the input data bus line A directly to the fourth bit of the output data bus lineC. As described above, the operation can be processed in one step such that the input data is processed, except for the desired bit, which is left as an original value. Figs. SA and SB show other examples for shifting data bit positions. Fig. 5A illustrates the case in which the upper 4 bits of the 8 bit input data are shifted to the lower 4 bits of the output data and the lower 4 bits of the input data are shifted to the upper 4 bits of the output data. Fig. SB illustrates the case in which the lower 4 bits of the 8 bit input data are shifted to both the upper 4 bits of the output data and the lower 4 bits of the output data. Fig. 6 shows another example of the integrated circuit information processor according to the present invention. The example shown in Fig. 6 is prepared for effecting the data processing shown in Figs. 5A and 5B.In both cases, the input data bus lines to through t7 and output data bus lines Lo through L7 are connected through transfer gates 9 and 10. When an enable signal, generated as described with reference to Fig. 3, is applied to a signal line 11, the shift operation of bit positions shown in Fig. 5A is effected and when an enable signal, again generated as described with reference to Fig. 3, is applied to a signal line 12, the shift operation of bit positions shown in Fig. 5B is effected. As described above, two types of shift operation of bit positions can be realized simply by the embodiment shown in Fig. 6. The shift operation of bit positions is not limited to the above embodiments and many changes and modifications can be carried out. Further the data length is not limited to 8 bits, and the data length of 4 bits, 12 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits and any other bit length can be applied to the invention. As described above, according to the present invention, data processing such as shift operation can be carried out at high speed. For example, suppose the capacitance C of the output data bus line is 2 pF andON resistance R of the transfer gate is 10 ka, the data transfer time T is indicated by the following equation T t 2.2RC t 44 nsWhere t is the charging time ns of input data bus line. From the above equation, the substantial operation time can be regarded as 44 ns which is an extremely short time. Further, in the above embodiments according to the invention only one transfer gate for one bit and one signal line which is common for all the transfer gates are needed. Further these transfer gates consume low power and can be buried between the bus line in production. Therefore, the area of a chip for the transfer gates is not increased and only the area for the signal line is slightly increased. Obviously, numerous additional modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.
