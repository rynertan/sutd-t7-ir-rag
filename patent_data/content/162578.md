# A condenser.

## Abstract
A condenser is provided with a heat exchanger which is rotated in an airtight cylindrical vessel 1 filled with a fluid to be condensed. The rotated heat exchanger has a structure almost similar to a rotor of a steam turbine, namely, has a structure formed of plural pairs of hollow blades 6a ar ranged individually opposite to each other on both sidewalls of an elongated rectangular hollow axle 5a rotated in the fluid to be condensed, all of those hollows being commu nicated with each other, so as to circulate a coolant thereth rough. As a result, the fluid to be condensed always uniformly contacts with the coolant through surfaces of the blades 6a with an extremely high performance of condensation.
