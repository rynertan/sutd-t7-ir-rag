# Volume reduction of low level radioactive wastes.

## Abstract
The volume of low level radioactive wastes containing free water is reduced by introducing the waste as a finely atomized spray into a zone heated by means of a hot gas. Contact of the spray particles with the hot gas results in the production of a dry, flowabie radioactive solid product and a gaseous non radioactive product which contains substantial ly no NO
