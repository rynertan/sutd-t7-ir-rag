# Hand firearm having means for dispensing debilitating chemical repellants.

## Abstract
A hand firearm such as a standard revolver having means for dispensing debilitating chemical substance through a nozzle 22 in the butt end, in a direction transverse to the barrel, whereby a self contained unit comprising a reservoir 15 for containing the debilitating chemical under pressure, such as Chemical Mace or tear gas, is detachably mounted on the butt end. A valve means 28 for dispensing the repellant is actuated by depression of a button 24 located on the detachably mounted butt end portion unit, below and out of the way of the hand grip, for operation by the last digit 25 of the hand. The presence of the reservoir 15 as the mounted butt end of the shank portion 14 of the gun allows for operation without interference with a strong hand grip, avoids accidental lethal firing of the weapon and permits fast recharging in the event the reservoir 15 is depleted or in the event that there is a mechanical failure of the discharge system 21, 22, 28 .
