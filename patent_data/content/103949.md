# Electrical header assembly for a printed circuit board.

## Abstract
A header assembly comprising a thermo plastic housing 12 and two rows of metallic conductor pins 14 is attached to a printed circuit board 60. The conductor pins have tails 38 which are bent over anvil portions 40, 42 of the housing and project through slots 46 in a locator plate 44 at the conductor end 20 of the housing. The locator plate slots have detents 48, 50 for retaining the bent tails in a pattern to facilitate assembly and soldering of the tails in a matching pattern of holes in the printed circuit board. Stress on the solder connections due to differential thermal expansion is reduced by flexure of the conductor pins in enlarged rearward cavity portions 32 and by slippage of the bent tails in the detents.
