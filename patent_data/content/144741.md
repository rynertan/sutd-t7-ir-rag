## Description
TITLE OF THE IN VEN1lON Electrically conductive powder for mixing with cyanoacrylates and electrically conductive curable composition using the sameBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to an electrically conductive powder for mixing with cyanoacrylates, and an electrically conductive composition containing this powder and cyanoacrylates as basic components.Description of the Prior Art Cyanoacryl ates rapidly cure at room temperature in contact with materials to be adhered and hence have been widely used as a one pack, non solvent type adhesive for adhering plastics, rubbers, ceramics, glass, metals, etc.in various commercial fields. If an adhesive of the one pack, non solvent type, which is curable at room temperature, such as the mentioned cyanoacrylates, could be provided with electric conductivity after being cured, this would be very valuable as an electrically conductive adhesive in the aspect of practical use thus realization of such an adhesive has been desired. However, mixtures obtained by mixing a highly electrically conductive metal powder with cyanoacrylates have a much inferior storage stability and polymerize rapidly before use. Namely, metal powder has a property of notably inducing cyanoacrylate polymerization and the resulting adhesive composition is unsuitable to practical use hence a useful electrically conductive cyriocrylate adhesive has never been realized. Thus, as electrically conductive adhesives, mixtures consisting of metal powder and an epoxy resin have usually been often used, but those of the room temperature curing type have a notably inferior storage stability, whereas those of good storage stability type do not cure in a short time unless heated hence they are practically very inconvenient. The present inventor has made extensive research in order to obtain a curable composition having a good stability and superior electrical conductivity by the use of cyanoacrylates. As a result, there was found that in the case where metal powder is subjected to a particular treatment, even when it is mixed with cyanoacrylates or cyanoacrylates having a polymerization inhibiting substance added, the resulting composition hardly causes cyanoacrylate polymerization, and when a composition consisting of such a metal powder and cyanoacrylates or cyanoacrylates having a polymerization inhibiting substance is cured, the resulting cured material has a good electrical conductivity.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide an electrically conductive powder for mixing with cyanoacrylates, which, when mixed with cyanoacrylates, can afford a superior storage stability with inducing little cyanoacrylate polymerization. Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrically conductive, curable composition containing as its main agents, an electrically conductive powder which induces little cyanoacrylate polymerization at the time of storage and cyanoacrylates, and taving a superior storage stability and yet good curability at room temperature and also a superior electrical conductivity in the cured state. The present invention provides an electrically conductive powder for mixing with cyanoacrylates, which consists of a metal powder treated as to prevent or inhibit the property of metal powder of inducing cyanoacrylate polymerization and an electrically conductive, curable composition containing as its main components, an electrically conductive metal powder treated as above and cy a noa cryl at es or as main co onents, an electrically conductive metal powder treated as above and cyanoacrylates having added a substance for preventing or inhibiting the property of metal powder of inducing cyanoacrylate polymerization, which substance is used for the above treatment of electrically conductive powder. An embodiment of the present invention resides in that the above electrically conductive powder for mixing with cyanoacrylates is a metal powder treated with a substance which reacts uith water or and acidifies water to thereby prevent or inhibit the property of metal powder of inducing cyanoacrylate polymerization hereinafter the substance will be referred to as cyanoacrylate polymerization inhibiting substance . Another embodiment of the present invention resides in that the above cyanoacrylate polymerization inhibiting substance is added as an independent component besides the case where the substance is used for treating the electrically conductive powder and in the case where the substance is added to cyanoacrylates.

Further, the reactive, polymerization inhibiting substances and the acidic, polymerization inhibiting substances may be used alone or at the same time. The treatment of metal powder with the polymerization inhibiting substances is preferably carried out usually by making metal powder present in gas phase or liquid phase containing the polymerization inhibiting substances and treat it with stirring or without stirring. In this case, a solvent may , and the temperature employed preferably room temperature ci a bigber terlperature. In addition, metal powder is preferably treated under reduced pressure or dried under low humidity in advance of treating the powder with the polymerization inhibiting substances. The amount of the polymerization inhibiting substances used for treating metal powder in the present invention varies depending on the kind of metal powder, the kind of the polymerization inhibiting substances ad the manner of treating the ponder with the substances, but the amount is usually in the range of 0.01 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of metal powder, in the case of the reactive, polymerization lnFibiting substances. Further it is usually in the range of 0.01 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 0.07 to 10 parts by weight, in the case of the acidic, polymerizationinhibiting substances. Naturally, it is desirable that the metal powder used in the present invention is dried before or and after treating as above. In the present invention, the temperature at which metal powder is dried or placed under reduced pressure has no particular limitation in a range from freezing point to high temperatures, but such high temperatures as deform the shape of metal powder used are of course undesirable. In the present invention, as to the manner in which the dried atmosphere is prepared, its representative examples are a manner wherein E drying agent is placed in an adequate closed vessel, folk owed by still standing, and a manner employing a systen in hich a dry inert gas such as nitrogen, i ur.., rrrgon, etc. flows continuously. Of coarse, drying udder reduced pressure may be employed.

In the present invention, when metal powder is dried or treated under reduced pressure, it may be held in any state of dynamic states such as stirring, vibration, etc.The metal powder for mixing with cyanoacrylates, obtained according to the present invention, is preferably placed in a dry atmosphere during the period till it is mixed with cyanoacrylates, i.e. during its storage, transportation, weighing, etc. The reduced pressure employed in the present invention has no particular limitation, but it refers usually to 30 mmHg or less, preferably 10 mmHg or less, in terms of the degree of vacuum of mercury column. Cyanoacrylates used in the present invention include a1 of various esters of 2 cyanoacrylic acid.

Cyanoacrylates are preferably dehydrated in advance under reduced pressure or by drying. This is due to the fact that when metal powder treated with the polymerization inhibiting substances is used, the water content in cyanoacrylates has a larger influence as compared with conventional cyanoacrylate adhesives having no electrical conductivity so that cyanoacrylates are liable to polymerize at the time of storage. The amount of cyanoacrylates used based on 100 parts by weight of electrically conductive powder for mixing with cyanoacrylates in the present invention is usually in the range of 10 to 150 parts by weight, preferably 25 to 100 parts by weight.

In order to cure the electrically conductive composition of the present invention in seconds, the curing accelerator comprising amine s solution can be used onto the droplet of the mixed composition on a surface of a substrate. The electrically conductive, curable composition of the present invention may be used for various applications, such as adhesives requiring electrical conductivity, applied for the adhesion of plastics, rubbers, ceramics, etc., concretely, for example, adhesion for caulking reinforcement and contact stabilization of eyelet or screw part, ceramics and metals, taking out of leads of quartz crystal oscillator, flash, cadmium sulfide meter, etc., carbon brush of motor, LED element to base, and semiconductor element of die bonding to electrode.
