## Description
NOVEL COMPOSITIONSThe present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions, in particular to compositions having broad spectrum anthelmintic activity, and their use in human and veterinary medicine.Accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I EMI1.1 in which R is optionally substituted phenyl, C38 cycloalkyl, C58 cycloalkenyl, C18 alkyl which may be straight or branched, C28 alkenyl which may be straight or branched, 5 or 6 membered heterocyclyl, or optionally substituted phenyl C1 4 alkyl Y and Z, which may be the same or different, represent oxygen or sulphur and X is CH2 or oxygen and at least one other anthelmintically active compound.Compounds of formula I are claimed in European PatentApplication No. 84107989.0 Publication Number 0 134 984 Al . Suitably, the said other anthelmintically active compound has anthelmintic activity against nematodes, especially against hook worms and ascarid worms in man or domestic animals, for example dogs and cats.Suitable compounds with anthelmintic activity are the benzimidazole anthelmintics for example fenbendazole macrocyclic lactones for example in an avermectin or piperazine, morantel, pyrantel or levamisole.Some of the anthelmintically active compounds form salts it will be understood therefore that the composition of the present invention may include a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of these compounds.Suitable salts are the acid addition salts, for example the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, sulphuric, citric, tartaric and pamoic acids.A preferred compound is pyrantel or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in particular pyrantel pamoate.When used herein the term pharmaceutical1 includes the term veterinary and the term pharmaceutically includes the term veterinarily . Compounds of formula I have an asymmetric carbon atom marked by an asterisk and may therefore exist in at least two stereoisomeric forms. The present invention encompasses all isomers of the compounds of formula I whether pure or admixed with other isomers in any proportion. When R is optionally substituted phenyl, the phenyl group may be substituted with up to three groups selected from halogen, C16 alkyl, C16 alkoxy, nitro, amino, mono or di C1 6 alkylamino, and hydroxy.When R is heterocyclyl, it may be a 5 or 6 membered saturated or unsaturated group containing up to three hetero atoms selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen. It will be appreciated that unsaturatd heterocyclyl groups suitably include aromatic heterocyclyl groups.The term halogen refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. A preferred R group is cyclohexyl.Compounds of formula I may be produced by cyclising a compound of formula II EMI3.1 in which X is as defined in formula I R1 is hydrogen, a protecting group or a groupEMI3.2 wherein R and Y are as defined in formula I and R2 is C13 alkyl or hydrogen and thereafter, if necessary i removing any protecting group R1 and replacing it with a groupEMI3.3 or ii when R1 is hydrogen, replacing it with a groupEMI4.1 and or iii converting the compound of formula I thus formed, wherein Z is oxygen, to a compound of formula I wherein Z is sulphur, by treatment with a thionation reagent.As used herein the term thionation reagent denotes a reagent capable of converting the groupEMI4.2 into the groupEMI4.3 A preferred thionation reagent is Lawesson s reagent, i.e. 2,4 bis 4 methoxyphenyl 1,3 dithia 2, 4 diphosphetane 2,4 disulphide, as described, for example, in Synthesis, 941 1979 , Tetrahedron 35, 2433 1979 and Tetrahedron Letters, 21, 4061 1980 .In the above process, replacement of the group R1Eafter the compound of formula II has been cyclised by the groupEMI4.4 in which Y is sulphur, may be carried out using a dithioic ester of formulaEMI4.5 whereinR is hereinbefore defined and R4 is C1 6 alkyl. As used herein the term protecting group refers to a group which is stable under the cyclisation reaction conditions but which may readily be removed after the cyclisation is complete. A typical example of such a protecting group is benzyl, which may be removed by catalytic hydrogenation, for instance using a palladium catalyst in a suitable solvent, for example ethanol.Examples of R2 are methyl, ethyl, propyl and hydrogen preferably R2 is hydrogen.Compounds of formula II may be cyclised by treatment with an acid catalyst, and conveniently an acid such as polyphosphoric acid may be used. The reaction may be conducted at elevated temperature, such as 1000C or greater, for instance at about 1800C. Alternatively, concentrated sulphuric acid may be used, in which case the reaction is carried out at a lower temperature , for example from 100C to 400C.Compounds of formula II wherein R2 is hydrogen may be produced by reducing the corresponding imide of formula III EMI5.1 wherein X, and R1 are as hereinbefore defined. The reduction is effected using a suitable hydride reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride in a suitable solvent such as a lower alkanol, preferably ethanol. Compounds of formula 11 wherein R2 is alkyl may be produced by conventional methods, such as those outlined in the papers of W.Speckamp et al Efor example, see Tetrahedron 31, 1437 1975 1. Compounds of formula III may be produced according toScheme I, using conventional reagents, such as those shown in the scheme. Scheme IEMI6.1 In Scheme I, R3 is a protecting group or a groupEMI7.1 in which Y is as hereinbefore defined, and X is as hereinbefore defined.It will be appreciated that the compounds of formula IIIa in Scheme I have the same structure as compounds of formula III as hereinbefore defined except when R1 in the latter is hydrogen.Compounds of formula III wherein R1 is hydrogen may be produced by removing a protecting group R3 from a compound of formula IIIa . Compounds of formula I have anthelmintic activity especially against tapeworm such as Taenia taeniaeformis and Dipylidium caninum. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is of use in the treatment of helminthiasis of the human or non human animal body, and particularly for treating tapeworm and or nematode infestations of domestic animals, especially dogs and cats and farm animals.Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method of treating helminthiasis, particularly tapeworm and or hema tod infestations, in human or domestic animals, which method comprises administering to the human or domestic animal in need thereof an anthelmintically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention.Suitably, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle the particular carrier used depending upon the chosen means of administration. Suitable carriers are those used conventionally in the art for the particular means of administration. Thus, for example, if the pharmaceutical composition is to be formulated as a bolus, tablet or capsule, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier will be chosen from the usual range of lubricants, dispersants, binders, fillers and the like.For administration to humans, especially children, the pharmaceutical composition may suitably be formulated as a syrup including suitable colouring and or flavouring agents. Such syrups are conveniently presented in unit or multi dose containers.For veterinary use the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated as a dispersion or a solution of the composition in a suitable vehicle for use with an oral doser a well known item of veterinary or farm equipment, comprising a liquid reservoir, a mouthpiece adapted for insertion into animals mouths, and a pump mechanism whereby unit doses can be ejected from the reservoir through the mouthpiece . Conveniently the pharmaceutical composition may be adminstered from the oral doser in the form of an aqueous suspension.Alternatively, the carrier included in the composition of the invention will be an oil or water based cream to ensure homogeneity of the unit doses administered.The pharmaceutical composition may also be added to the animal feed or drinking water so that the animal ingests an appropriate quantity of the pharmaceutical composition with its diet. In this case the composition is conveniently presented as a premix containing several doses. The pharmaceutical composition may also be formulated for injection. In such cases the pharmaceutical composition chosen is suitably dissolved or suspended in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, for example water, propylene glycol or glycerol formal.Suitably the pharmaceutical composition comprises sufficient material to provide a dose of from 0.01 to 250 mg of the compound of formula I per kg of animal body weight per dose, more suitably 0.1 to 50 mg kg per dose. The said other anthelmintically active compounds are present in the pharmaceutical composition in an amount sufficient to provide a dose within a range conventional for the particular compound.The following examples illustrate the invention Preparation XI 1 3 Phenylpropyl 4 benzyl 2, 6 piperazinedione 3 Phenyl l propylamine 3.63g andN benzyliminodiacetic acid 6.0g was mixed and heated to 2000C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
