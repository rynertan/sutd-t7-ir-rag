# ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCER AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME

## Abstract
An ultrasonic transducer comprising piezoelectric reso nators, a matching layer 24 formed on the ultrasonic oscilla tion surfaces of the resonators 12 , and a backing material 15 adhered on the opposite surface to the ultrasonic oscilla tion surface, wherein a cylindrical case 14 is fixed to the cir cumference of the resonators 12 and the backing material 15 is formed by being cast into the case 14 . A method for manufacturing the ultrasonic transducer,wherein the piezoel ectric ceramic 12 is temporarily fixed on a metal support and devided into a predetermined shape and a backing material 15 is formed as such that lead wires 13 are allowed to ex tend through the backing material 15 .
