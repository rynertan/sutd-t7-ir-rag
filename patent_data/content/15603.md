# Process for the dimerization of 1 alkenes.

## Abstract
Catalytic dimerization in solution of alpha,beta un substituted 1 alkenes having at least three carbon atoms by using a catalyst comprising a component Cpâ‚‚TiXY, an alkylaluminium halide and a nitrogen Lewis base, Cp being unsubstituted or alkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl, X being halogen or alkyl and Y being halogen. The reaction product consists of substantially one single dimer and virtually no higher polymers.
