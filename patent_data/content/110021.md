# Producing modified high performance polyolefin fiber and film.

## Abstract
Fibers prepared by spinning, drawing and drying dilute solutions of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene or po lypropylene are modified by including in the dilute solution a polymeric additive. The polyethylene fibers so prepared have melting points above 140 C and exhibit improved adherence to matrices, resistance to fibrillation and other advantageous properties. Additives include lower molecu lar weight polyolefins, oxidized polyolefins, olefin copoly mers, polyolefin graft copolymers and polyoxymethylenes.
