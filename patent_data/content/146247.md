# LIGHTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Lighting apparatus comprises a rod like member such as a candle having a light source, typically a flame or bulb at an upper end thereof. An optical fibre extends along the rod like member with its upper end juxtaposed the light source and the lower end in operative relationship with a photosensor which may act as a switch. In a specific embodiment the photosensor is connected with a sound reproductive system so that when the light source is illuminated, the luminous flux transmitted by the optical fibre is above the threshold which triggers the photosensor and renders the sound reproductive system operative.
