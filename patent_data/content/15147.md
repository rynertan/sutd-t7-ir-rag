# Lithographic ink containing oxidatively curable reactive diluent and use thereof.

## Abstract
In lithographic inks containing colorant, binder resin and reactive diluent, the diluent comprises oxidatively curable ester prepared by reaction of drying oil fatty acid with hydroxyl containing, addition polymerizable compounds, such as reaction product of polyol with addition polymeriz able acid, hydroxyalkyl ester of such acid, hydroxyalkyl vinyl sulfide or hydroxyalkyl vinyl ether. The curable ester may also be prepared by reaction of addition polymerizable acid with hydroxyl containing reaction product of polyol with drying oil fatty acid. Transesterifiable esters can be used instead of the acids. Preferred drying oil acids are derived from tung oil, linseed oil, safflower oil, soybean oil or dehydrated castor oil. The curable ester preferably comprises acryloxy alkyl or methacryloxy alkyl drying oil fatty acid ester.
