# Orifice meter.

## Abstract
An orifice meter comprising a gate valve type of body with an oval body band clamped between a pair of parallel plates 12, 14 . A gate like carrier 22 slides between the plates 12, 14 and carries an orifice disc 30 with seal ring 36 surrounding it. The seal rings 48, 50 seal around the flow passage and the orifice disc 30 is large enough to be held in place by engagement with the adjacent wall plate. In a more remote position, the seal rings 48, 50 may seal around an access opening 62 , which is larger than the orifice disc 30 so that by removing a closure plate 64 , the orifice disc 30 can be rapidly replaced.
