# Method of making permanent magnet of Mn Al C alloy.

## Abstract
A manganese aiuminium carbon alloy magnet is pro duced by subjecting a polycrystalline Mn Al C alloy magnet having a specified direction to easy magnetization to com pressive working in that direction at a temperature of 550 to 780 C. The degree of compressive working is equivalent to a logarithmic strain of 0.1 and the compression at least up to the logarithmic strain of 0.1 being free compression. The resulting magnet is magnetically anisotropic in thre imensional terms, but is magnetically isotropic in two dimensional terms in planes including the specified direc tion .
