# Production of high viscosity index lubricating oil stock.

## Abstract
Waxy hydrocarbon oils, e.g., of petroleum origin, boiling within the approximate range of 232 to 556 C are catalytically dewaxed utilizing a catalyst comprising a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite possessing particularly characterized pore openings, such as, for example, ZSM 23 or ZSM 35, which may be associated with a hydrogenation metal.
