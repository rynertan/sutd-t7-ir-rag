# Adhesive supply system.

## Abstract
In a thermo cementing and folding machine which has a suck back facility, by which at the end of an adhesive applying operation adhesive supplied through the nozzle 22 is sucked back into the nozzle so as to prevent drooling , auxiliary suck back steps are introduced at timed intervals following the primary suck back operation, through control led amounts, in order to counter further risk of drooling caused by thermal expansion of the adhesive in the nozzle 22 . The number of auxiliary suck back steps is variable according to the adhesive supply rate at the time of termination of the adhesive applying operation.
