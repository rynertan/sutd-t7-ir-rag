## Description
ELASTOMERIC COMPOSITION IN THE FORM OF A FRIABLE BALE, AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME This invention relates to an elastomeric composition based on EPDM rubber in the forts of a friable bale, and to a process for producing the same. In the manufacture of synthetic elastomers, such as for example EPDM rubbers, the elastomeric material is produced in the form of crumbs, which are successively dried and then compressed into bales for storage. The bales, at the time of use, are broken down into crumbs for formulating blends or mixtures with other rubbers, various additives, vulcanizing or curing agents etc. During storage, however, the weight of the stacked bales causes adhesion between the crumbs of the elastomer and an increase in the density of the bales., as a result of which considerable difficulties are experienced in utilizing such products for the abovementioned mixing or compounding operations. This drawback is particularly encountered when the manufacture of the bales starting from the elastomeric material crumbs is effected at a temperature higher than about 300 C, as occurs for example in the summer. The present invention in one aspect provides an elastomeric composition in the form of a friable bale, having a bulk density of 0.4 to 0.6 g cm3, and being produced by compaction of porous crumbs of a mixture of an elastomeric copolymer of the EPDM type containing from 25 to 40 by weight of bound propylene, having a Mooney viscosity MI 4 100 C of 40 to 100 and a green strength value higher than 10 kg cm2, with up to 5 by weight, calculated on the basis of the said copolymer, of low density ramified polyethylene having a melt index of from 0.1 to 100. The invention in another aspect provides a process for preparing a friable bale of an elastomeric composition, comprising preparing porous crumbs of a mixture of an EPDM elastomeric copolymer containing from 25 to 40 by weight of bound propylene, having a Mooney viscosity MI 4 100 C of from 40 to 100 and a green strength value higher than 10 kg cm2, with up to 5 by weight, calculated on the basis of the sa d copolymer, of low density ramified polyethylene having a melt index of 0.1 to 100, and then compressing the crumbs into a bale having a bulk density of from 0.4 to 0.6 g cm3. Thus it has now been found that it is possible to eliminate the above described drawbacks by mixing the elastomer, prior to its breaking down into crumbs, with low density polyethylene density from 0.91 to 0.93 g cm3 , in amounts up to 5 by weight referred to the elastomer, and then by compressing the crumbs into bales having a bulk density of 0.40 to 0.60 g cm3. In this manner bales are obtained which are friable even after extended stacking periods, and also when they are manufactured at temperatures exceeding 300 C. Elastomeric polymers employable for the purposes of the present invention are the ethylene propylene diene terpolymers containing from 25 to 40 by weight of copolymerized propylene, but preferably containing from 27 to 33 by weight of such monomer, and up to 10 by weight, preferably from 3 to 5 by weight, of a copolymerized non conjugated dienic monomer. Representative examples of such dienic monomers are provided by the open chain aliphatic diolefins, containing from 5 to 22 carbon atoms, in which the double bonds are separated by more than 2 carbon atoms, and containing at least one end double bond, and in addition by dicyclopentadiene, cyclooctadiene, 5 alkenyl substituted 2 norbornenes, 5 methylene 2 norbornene, and 2 alkyl 2, 5 norbornadiene. These elastomeric polymers exhibit green strength values higher than 10 kg cm2, preferably from 10 to 30 kg cm2, and have a Mooney viscosity MI 4 100 C preferably from 40 to 100. For the purposes of the present invention, the low density polyethylene is preferably added to the elastomer in amounts from 3 to 5 referred to the elastomer weight.Such polyethylene is of the ramified type and generally exhibits melt index values within the range of 0.1 to 100. he porous crumbs used to form the elastomeric composition are prepared according to conventional methods used for preparing crumbs of elastomeric material, starting from suspensions in water into which the elastomer coming from a reactor is discharged for the removal of the reaction organic solvents. According to such methods, the structure in more or less porous crumbs is generally obtained by extrusion of the elastomer under flash conditions of the residual liquid contained therein, consisting predominantly of water. For preparing the crumbs it is sufficient to intimately mix the low density polyethylene, in an amount as defined above, with the elastomer before carrying out such extrusion. The process may be suitably carried out as follows. An organic suspension of the elastomer coming from a polymerization reactor is conveyed into water for removal of the organic solvent the aqueous suspension then flows into an expeller working at 1000 1200C, where most of the water is removed and where the elastomer is simultaneously additioned and preliminarily mixed with polyethylene in granules or in powder form the mixture is then sent to an expander working at a higher temperature than the polyethylene melting temperature, and preferably such that the product leaving the expander, in the form of porous crumbs, contains not more than 0.5 by weight of water.Generally the expander operates at from 1500C to 220 C. The resulting product in the form of crumbs is then dried, compacted or compressed into bales having a density of from 0.4 to 0.6 g cm3, and then enclosed into cartons, all these operations being preferably effected continuously, at temperatures even exceeding 300C, without the product losing its friability and density characteristics during storage in stacks. The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples. IZAMPIE 1 For this preparation, use was made of an Anderson finishing apparatus, consisting of an expeller operating at 1100C and of an extruder expander operating at 200 C. In the expeller, 3 parts by weight of low density ramified polyethylene, having a melt index of 21, were mixed with 100 parts by weight calculated on dry weight of an ethylene propylene ethylidenenorbornene terpolymer, having the following characteristics Propylene content 30 by weight Ethylidenenorbornene content 3.5 by weight Mooney viscosity 75 Green strength 20 kg cm2 Water content 20 A homogeneous mixture of the two polymers having a water content of 7 by weight referred to the mixture left the expeller. Such mixture was extruded in the expander, whereby a product in the form of porous crumbs was obtained. Two lots a , b of such product were dried at temperatures of 3500 and 4700 respectively, and at such temperatures these lots were compressed into bales in a presser untilabulk density of 0.55 g cm3 and 0.56 g cm3 respectively was reached. The operative conditions and the friability characteristics of the bales are given in the Table below. EXAMPLE 2 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated, except that the polyethylene content was 5 by weight and that the temperatures employed to form the bales were 3200 and 44 C respectively, the densities of the bales being respectively 0.46 g cm3 and 0.5 g cm3. The friability characteristics of the bales are given in the Table. below.EXAMPLE 3 Comparative Test he procedure of Example 1 was repeated, except that the elastomer was not additioned with polyethylene, the drying and packaging temperatures were 300C and 3500 respectively, the bulk densities of the bales being 0.5 g cm3 and greater than 0.6 g cm3 respectively0 he characteristics of the bales are given in theTable below.
