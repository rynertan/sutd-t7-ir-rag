# Temperature measuring device.

## Abstract
An optical type temperature measuring device which provides an accurate output in spite of temperature varia tions of the sensor 9 or degradation of the characteristics of the sensor over time. The device includes a light source 6 , a spectroscope 15 , and a temperature sensor 9 made of a material having one end coupled through a first optical guide 2 to the light source 6 and the other end coupled through another optical guide 4 to the spectroscope 15 . The output of the spectroscope 15 is converted to an electrical signal, which is subsequently detected with plural different com parison levels to obtain higher end values of the absorption wavelength ranges of the sensor at the respective reference levels. These higher end values are then processed to obtain a rising point of a temperature dependent light absorption characteristic curve of the temperature sensor 9 .
