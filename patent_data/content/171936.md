# VIBRATION ISOLATION SECTION FOR A SEISMIC STREAMER

## Abstract
A vibration isolator section for a seismic streamer having a flexible tube 1 of plastics material containing nylon rope strainwire s 4 attached to discretely spaced bulkheads 2 substantially filling the tube cross section, with open spacer elements 3 between the bulkheads supporting the tube wall and electrical cables 5, the remaining internal volume of the section being filled with an electrically inert liquid, the placement of the bulkheads being such as to optimise the attenuation of vibrational energy at peak input frequencies.
