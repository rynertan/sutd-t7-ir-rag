# A process for preparing overbased alkaline earth metal, particularly magnesium lubricant additives, and a process for determining the critical carbonation rate for such process.

## Abstract
A process for preparing colloidal overbased alkaline earth metal, particularly magnesium, additives in a diluent oil wherein an alkaline earth metal oxide is reacted with carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent, the oil and a dispersing agent and the additive recovered. The water is added prior to or simultaneously with the carbon dioxide. The metal oxide is present in the mixture in an amount in excess of that theoretically required to produce an additive having a desired alkali value. Most importantly, the carbon dioxide is added at the critical carbonation rate, which is defined as being that which maintains the carbon dioxide concentration at a level which causes the conversion of the metal oxide into colloidally dispersed carbonate at a maximum relative to the conversion thereof into undispersed products. The carbon dioxide addition is continued until the reaction is completed. The critical carbonation rate is evaluated by treating identical reaction mixtures at differing carbon dioxide addition rates and selecting the rate which gives a product having the highest alkali value.
