# Oxygen scavenging system for anaerobiosis.

## Abstract
A self contained system is provided for producing an oxygen free environment for anaerobiosis and culturing wherein the system possesses the ability to provide and maintain the oxygen free environment, even after the open ing and closing of the sealed container therefore several times. The system includes a metallic couple, preferably copper magnesium, which reacts with water to induce and maintain the oxygen free environment. The degree of addi tion of water to the system controls the rate of reduction of the environment. The system possesses a dual oxygen scavenging function by the controlled addition of water. That is, if a small amount of moisture is added to the system couple of the invention, hydrogen is liberated, which causes a drying in the system simultaneously with a reaction of a portion of the couple to gradually scavenge oxygen from the environment, simultaneously with the liberation of hyd rogen, if desired, in such an arrangement, the subsequent addition of water generates hydrogen again until all the magnesium is used up, in order to provide a subsequent oxygen scavenging property. In addition, the system in cludes a sealable petri dish so conformed to include means for maintaining the system of the invention in combination with an indicator for anaerobiosis, a catalyst for the system, a carbon dioxide generator, and space for the culture media.
