# Process and apparatus for manufacturing optical fibre preforms at high deposition rate.

## Abstract
The process allows a uniform layer of glass particles, forming the preform, to be deposited on the internal wall of a supporting tube 1 rotated around its axis. A suitable relationship is provided to determine the temperature distri bution in the deposition zone. The apparatus makes use of different types of heat sources 2 for generating inside the tube a temperature with the distribution required by the process.
