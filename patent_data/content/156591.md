# ANODIZING PROCESS FOR PRODUCING HIGHLY REFLECTIVE ALUMINUM MATERIALS

## Abstract
An improved process is provided for the production of aluminum reflective material having a high total reflectance value. The process comprises controlling the anodizing con ditions of an aluminum alloy by immersing the alloy in a DC anodizing bath containing at least 26 wt. sulfuric acid and the anodizing sheet at a current density of at least 194 A mÂ² at a temperature of at least 15 C.
