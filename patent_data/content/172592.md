# Method and printing device for the line wise printing of a image composed of an assembly of image elements.

## Abstract
The line wise printing of a image composed of an assembly of image elements pixels by means of a printing head which embodies a row of N N 2 printing elements which are arranged along a image line at a mutual distance from each other. The printing stroke is greater than the distance between two neighboring prin ting elements, as a result of which there is created at least one strip in the image in which there are pixel positions which are covered by m 2 m N printing heads. For this strip or strips several options are then pre sented for printing the pixels situated within them. A pixel in such a strip can now be printed by one or by several of these m printing elements, the allocation of one or more of these m printing elements to a position being capable of being chosen as fixed or variable. Fur thermore, it is possible, if a pixel can be printed by several printing elements, to distribute the pixel prin ting values of the relevant pixel point over these several printing elements according to a fixed or variable dis tribution code.

## Description
The invention relates to a method for the line wise printing of a image composed of an assembly of picture elements pixels by means of a printing head, which print ing head embodies a row ofN N 2 which are arranged along an image line at a mutual distance from each other, which mutual distance is greater than the distance between two successive pixels in the same picture line, which printing head is moved during a printing stroke in the direction of an image line to be printed, and in which process a first control signal is generated for each pixel to be printed for the single color printing of that pixel. Such a method is known from the British Patent Application GB PA 2025725. In the known method an image, which is composed of an assembly of pixels, is printed by causing the printing head to move in the direc tion of such an image line for each image line to be printed. Each of the printing elements of the printing head then prints a number of successive positions of such an image line during the same printing stroke and each position of such an image line is covered by only one printing element during the printing of the same color. The printing stroke corresponds to the mutual distance between two successive printing elements, which mutual distance is the same for all the printing elements in the printing head. After the printing of an image line, the carrier on which the image is being printed is displaced in a direction perpendicular to the image line in order to print a next image line. For each pixel to be printed a first control signal is generated, which first control signal has an intensity which matches the pixel print value of the relevant pixel. The printing of a pixel then takes place by activating the printing element which covers the image position to be printed under the control of the relevant first control signal. A disadvantage of the known method is that each position within a line is covered only by the same printing element. As a result of this, in the line wise printing of an image, in particular a graphic image, or in the printing of half tones, interference patterns arise in the printed image which disturb the optical density of the printed image. These interference patterns are charac terized, for example, by a line pattern between successive strips of pixels which are printed by the same printing element, or by large differences in optical density which results in a pattern of bands in the picture. The interference and or band patterns arise as a result of geometrical and or electrical inaccuracies in one or more printing elements of the printing head, and become all the more pronounced if a strip of successive pixels in succes sive image lines are printed by such a same printing element with an inaccuracy. The object of the invention is to provide a method for the line wise printing of a image composed of an assembly of pixels by means of a printing head, in which method the said interference and or band patterns are suppressed. In a method according to the invention the print ing stroke is larger than the distance between two neigh boring printing elements and for at least one strip of pixels which extends transversely to the image line direction and which, for each image line, contains seve ral pixels which are each covered by m 2 m N print ing elements, there is allocated to each pixel situated in the same image line and in such a strip one of the m said printing elements, which allocation is achieved by printing a pixel situated later in the image line by means of a printing element disposed earlier in the said row and by printing a pixel situated earlier in the image line by means of a printing element disposed later in the same row, each pixel being printed by the energizing of the printing element allocated to it under the control of the respective first control signal. Because the printing stroke is now greater than the distance between two neighboring printing elements, there is produced in the image strips of pixels which are covered by m printing elements. As a result the oppor tunity is now presented of selecting for each pixel in such a strip which of these m printing elements will print that pixel. Doing this has the result that successive pixels in such a strip may no longer be covered by the same printing elements but by different ones. The inter ference in the image caused by the fact that successive positions are printed by the same printing element which is beset with an inaccuracy is consequently suppressed. Thus, according to the invention one of the m printing elements is allocated to each pixel in such a strip. In making that allocation, however, a criterion is adhered to which takes into consideration the fact that successive pixels in the same image line in such a strip are actually printed by different printing elements. The actual print ing of the pixels in such a strip is achieved by energizing the allocated printing elements under the control of the respective first control signal for the relevant pixel. The pixels which are located outside the said strip are printed in the known manner by the printing element which covers that position. Furthermore, the fact that more than one printing element scans the same position presents the opportunity of making better allowance for the characteristics both of the printing device and of the printing head and may under certain circumstances make it possible to impose less stringent requirements on the quality of the printing head. Thus, allowance can be made for geometrical and electrical inaccuracies in a printing element or for printing elements which function less satisfactorily. Interference patterns resulting from any inaccuracy in one or more printing elements are now averaged out by the various elements which cover the relevant position or by the fact that a row of successive positions is now no longer necessarily has to be serviced by the same printing element. In thermal printing devices better allowance can be made for the cooling down times of the printing elements. An alternative solution for the suppression of the said interference patterns is described in the US Patent No. 4,374,385. The method described therein makes use of a printing device in which the printing head embodies an assembly of thermal printing elements. The thermal print ing elements are activated under the control of a second control signals, each second control signal being derived from the first control signal. In the method known there from, after the printing of a first number of positions, the carrier is displaced over a distance which is substan tially equal to half the length of the distance formed by the line wise disposed printing elements. After this dis placement, the printing elements are again activated and the positions which in the previous printing were situated between two successive printing elements are now printed in order to partially suppress the interference pattern. However, during this displacement the carrier is displaced during the printing with respect to the printing head, which is not the case in a method according to the invention. This is a risky solution because the displace ment of the carrier requires an extremely accurate mechan ism for the carrier transport, which is very expensive. If the accuracy of the paper transport is insufficient, the interference pattern is virtually not suppressed. Furthermore, each position within a printing stroke is only covered by one printing element. It is favorable for the said allocation of one of the said m printing elements to be undertaken in accordance with a predetermined distribution pattern. This makes a simple implementation of the allo cation of one of the said m printing elements possible, and presents the opportunity of creating a suitable distribution among the aforementioned m printing elements for each position in such a strip. It is favorable, in the case where a strip con tains more than two pixels, for the aforementioned allo cation of one of the said m printing elements to be under taken according to a distribution pattern, which distribu tion pattern is generated for each image line to be printed. The generation of a distribution pattern for each image line to be printed presents the opportunity of making allowance for inaccuracies which are inherent in the printing head. Furthermore, this presents the oppor tunity of ensuring that a given printing element is used often or less often. In an alternative embodiment of a method according to the invention in which each first control signal has an intensity which is matched to the pixel print value of the relevant, wherein the print stroke is larger than the distance between two neighboring printing elements and for at least one strip of pixels which extends transversely to the image line direction and which for each image line contains several pixels which are each covered by m 2 m N printing elements, which pixels in such a strip are successively printed by p 2 p m elements, there being generated for each pixel which is printed by p printing elements for activating each of the p printing elements a second control signal on the basis of portions of the intensity of the first control signal for that pixel, and that the sum of the intensities contained in all the second control signals for the same pixel is at least equal to the intensity in the first control signal for the relevant pixel. Because a pixel position is covered by m printing elements it is possible to cause the relevant pixel to be successively printed by p of the said m printing elements. This achieves the result that successive pixels in such a strip may no longer be covered by the same printing elements but by different ones. To maintain the pixel print value of each of the pixels in such a strip it is necessary to split up the intensity of the first control signal for the p second control signals which each respectively energize one of the p printing elements for the printing. Since the sum of the intensities contained in all the second control sig nals for the same pixel is at least equal to the intensity in the first control signal for that pixel, the result is achieved that the pixel print value of the pixel is main tained. The aforementioned sum may even be somewhat greater than the intensity of the first control signal if, for example, for thermal printing elements allowance is made for warming up effects. Because each of the p print ing elements now prints a portion of the pixel, the in accuracy of each of the p printing elements is smoothed out over the total. It is favorable for the intensity contained in the first control signal for each pixel belonging to such a strip to be divided into p portions according to a pre determined distribution code, and for the p printing elements which in each case print each pixel in any strip according to a predetermined pattern to be selected from the aforementioned m printing elements. This results in a simple solution for the division of the intensity into p fractions and for the selection of the said p printing elements from the said m printing elements. For each pixel in any strip and belonging to the same image line it is favorable for a distribution code to be generated according to which the intensity contained in the first control signal for that pixel is divided into p portions, and for the p printing elements which in each case print each pixel in any strip to be selected according to a predetermined pattern from the aforementioned m print ing elements. The generation of a distribution code creates a degree of freedom in the splitting up of the intensity. For each pixel in any strip belonging to the same image line it is favorable for a distribution pattern to be generated according to which p printing elements are selected from the m printing elements which cover that pixel and for the intensity contained in the first control signal for each pixel belonging to any strip to be divided into p portions according to a predetermined distribution code. The generation of a distribution pattern creates a degree of freedom in the selection of the p printing elements. It is favorable for the distribution code and or the distribution pattern for each image line to be invar iant. This makes it simple to achieve the control of the printing head and the printing according to the method of the invention. In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention the distribution code for each pixel j to be printed contains p weighting factors P Each of the weighting factors P Preferably the weighting factors for the same pixel are determined according to a probability distribution and the constant c is equal to 1. The probability dis tribution is for example a delta or a sinusoidal probability distribution. A probability distribution is simple to generate and guarantees a reasonable degree of smoothing. It is favorable for the distance over which the printing head is moved during a printing stroke to be substantially equal to a whole n number of times the mutual distance between two successive printing elements of the printing head. The aforementioned whole number of times n is a value which is smaller than, or at most equal to, the number of pixels which fit into the distance between two successive printing elements of the printing head. This makes the control system for displacing the printing head simple and is sufficient to suppress the interference patterns to a large extent. The invention also relates to a printing device for the line wise printing of an image composed of an assembly of pixels, the device emmbodying a printing head which embodies a row of N N 2 printing elements which are disposed along a printing line at a mutual distance from each other, which mutual distance is greater than the distance between two successive pixel positions in the same image line which is to be printed, which printing head is provided with means of displacement for displacing the printing head during a printing stroke in the direction of an image line which is to be printed, which printing device embodies a first control signal generator for the generation of a first control signal for each pixel to be printed, which first control signal generator is connected to the printing head in order to supply first control signals to the printing elements. Such a printing device is also known from the al ready mentioned British Patent Application GB PA 2025725. In a printing device according to the invention the displacement means are provided for the displacement of the printing head within a complete printing stroke over a distance which is greater than the distance between two neighboring printing elements and the printing device embodies a selection unit which is provided for allocating, in at least one strip of pixel positions which extends transversely to the image line and which for each image line contains several pixel positions which can be printed by m 2 m N printing elements, at each of the pixel positions situated on the same image line and in such a strip, one of the said m printing elements by selecting for a pixel position situated later in a image line a printing element disposed earlier in the said aforementioned and by selecting for a pixel position situated earlier in that image line a printing element disposed later in the aforementioned row, the first control signal generator being connected to the selection unit in order to supply the first control signal to the selected printing element. The means of displacement and the selection unit make possible the application of a method according to the invention. It is favorable for the selection unit to embody a first memory in which a distribution pattern is stored according to which one of the aforementioned m printing elements can be selected at each of the pixel positions in such a strip. If a fixed distribution pattern is used, a memory, for example a ROM, in which this distribution pattern is stored offers an advantageous solution. In an alternative embodiment of a printing device according to the invention, in which each first control signal contains an intensity which is matched to the pixel print value of the relevant pixel, the displacement means are provided for the displacement of the printing head within a full printing stroke over a distance which is larger than the distance between two neighboring printing elements and the printing device embodies a second control signal generator connected to the first control signal generator for the generation of second control signals for the printing of pixel positions from at least one strip of pixel positions which extends transversely to the image line direction and which for each image line contains seve ral pixel positions which can each be printed by m 2 m N printing elements, which second control signal generator is provided for the generation of p 2 p m second control signals for each pixel position in such a strip, each of the p control signals being capable of being generated for the same pixel position on the basis of a portion of the intensity of the first control signal for that pixel position and the sum of the intensities contained in all the second control signals for the same pixel position being at least equal to the intensity in the first control signal for that pixel position, and the printing device embodying a selec tion unit which is provided for the selection of p differ ent printing elements from the aforementioned m printing elements, which selection unit is connected to the print head and to the second control signal generator in order to supply the aforementioned p second control signals to the aforementioned p printing elements. The displacement means and the second control sig nal generator make possible the use of this alternative embodiment of a method according to the invention. Preferably the printing head is provided with ther mal printing elements. Geometrical and electrical inac curacies in the printing elements are common in the case of thermal printing elements so that when such thermal printers are used, interference patterns often occur, and these are particularly annoying if several colors are used for printing. The invention will be explained in further detail with reference to the drawings in which Figure 1a illustrates diagrammatically the rela tive movement of a printing head and the carrier in a preferred embodiment of a printing device in which a method according to the invention is used. This printing device embodies a printing head 2 which can be moved across a carrier, for example a paper 1. The paper moves in the direction of the arrow 5. The printing head 2 moves in the direction of the arrow 4 during the printing of a image line, and in the direction 4 during the return stroke of the printing head. The printing head embodies a number N N 2 of printing elements 6 which are disposed in a line, which line has substantially the same direction as the direction of motion of the printing head. The printing elements 6 are therefore placed perpendicular to the direction of movement of the paper. Figure 1b illustrates the surface of the printing head 2 which is brought into contact with the paper. The printing element 6, which are dot shaped or line shaped, are placed at a mutual distance dp from each other which is termed the printing element pitch . The printing element pitch is larger than the distance between two successive pixels in the same image line. Each printing element is connected to a control line for the trans mission of control signals for the activation of the printing element. The various control lines are assembled in a control bus 3. During a full movement, termed a Printing stroke , the printing head traverses a width b across the paper and prints a image line on the paper. The invention will be described by reference to a preferred embodiment in which the printing element 6 take the form of thermal printing elements. The printing device will therefore be described as a thermal printing device . The printing elements embody a resistance element and a control signal takes the form of a current pulse. Under the influence of such a current pulse a printing element is heated up. This heat is transferred to the paper. The paper has been treated, for example, with a chemical substance which, as a result of heat being supp lied, locally undergoes a change or, for example, a layer of wax paper is introduced between the printing head and the carrier. The use of colored wax paper makes color print ing possible. It will be clear that other printing elements such as, for example, printing needles or ink jet printers, can also be used in the application ofthe invention. An image is printed line wise on the paper and each line is built up of an assembly of pixels which are printed by the dot shaped or line shaped printing elements. The printing elements are activated under the control of control signals and in each case between two successive series of control signals the printing head is moved to a small extent in the direction of the arrow 4. In known printing devices the printing stroke is substantially equal to the printing element pitch. Figure 2 shows an example of a device for the printing of information. This device embodies a CPU 10, a read memory 11, for example a ROM, and a read write memory 17, for example a RAM, and also an input output interface 12, which are interconnected by means of a system bus 14 for the transmission of data and addresses. To the system bus 14 there is further connected a printing head control element 13, which in its turn is connected via the control bus 3 to the printing head 2. The printing head control element 13 is further connected to a motor 16 which is responsible for the movement of the printing head. The input output interface 12 has a number of connection lines 15 over which the information to be printed for example, originating from a teletext receiver is supplied. In the read memory 11 there are stored, inter alia, programs for the control of the printing head. These programs are performed in the known manner under the control of the CPU. Under control of the CPU and with the help of a program the information supplied via the input output interface 12 is translated into control signals which are fed to the printing head control element via the system bus 14. Each control signal contains an intensity which is matched to the pixel print value of the pixel to be printed, and is then converted at this point into energy for the activation of a printing element. In the case of a thermal printer this energy takes the form of electrical current pulses. The duration and or the current strength of these electrical current pulses is variable as a function of the pixel print value of the pixel to be printed. As a result of this the quantity of heat transferred to the paper varies. Figure 3 shows in enlarged format a number of image elements such as printed by a method in which the print stroke is equal to the element pitch. It is assumed that the printing head embodies four printing elements which are indicated by the capital letters A, B, C and D. A full printing stroke is made up of a number of substrokes in this example, 5 , and each printing element prints a pixel on the paper during such a substroke, which pixels lie on the same line. During one printing stroke a num ber of pixels are therefore printed. In the initial Figure 3 four successive printing strokes are illustrated. The assembly of pixels a, or respectively b, c, d are printed by the printing elements A, or respectively B, C, D. Figure 3 shows clearly the problem which occurs if dot shaped pixels are printed with a printing head of this type. A image contains a large number of pixels in which each pixel contains a number of image half tones or color intensities. As a result of geometrical and or electrical inaccuracies in the various printing elements of the printing head the geometrical shape and or the resistance values can vary for each printing ele ment the pixel printed by a printing element does not have a pure geometrical round or square shape. The uniform shape of the geometrical pattern is often disturbed as depicted in the pixel assembly b, c and d. This has the result that the optical density within an assembly of pixels is often disturbed, as a result of which, on the one hand, within the assembly of pixels small unprinted spots occur, but a clear vertical band structure is also produced in the plate. Each assembly of pixels which is printed by the same printing element forms, as it were, a separate band in the plate. Further more gaps also occur between the successive bands as a result of inaccurate positioning. Viewed over the whole image these gaps then form an annoying pattern of suc cessive vertical lines which, certainly in the case of a color plate, disturb the image. The invention now offers a number of methods of reducing the effect of the abovenamed faults in a printed image. The methods have in common that the printing stroke is greater than the pixel pitch. As a result of this, pixels are now covered by more than one printing element within the same line. If therefore in at least one strip of pixels which extends transversely to the printing line direction and which for each image line con tains several pixels which are each covered by m 2 m N printing elements, the possibility is created of causing that pixel to be printed by one or more of these m print ing elements. The methods according to the invention are in the main to be distinguished in four embodiments, viz. These various methods will now be described in more detail. The Figures 4a to e incl. illustrate exem plary embodiments of the methods 2, 3 and 4. Figure 4a shows a per se known printing head 2 of a thermal printing device. Figure 4b shows a row of 30 pixels which repre sent the 30 positions covered by the printing head 2 and Figure 4c gives numbers to the successive positions of the pixels in Figure 4b. Figure 4d illustrates the dis tance which is covered in this exemplary embodiment by the various printing elements during one complete printing stroke. From Figure 4 it can clearly be deduced that in this exemplary embodiment of a method according to the invention the printing stroke now comprises substantially twice the length of the printing element pitch. In relation to the usual printing stroke this therefore signifies a printing stroke which is substantially twice as large. With printing element A it is now possible to print at the positions 1 to 12 incl., while with the printing element B the positions 7 to 18 incl. can be printed. The printing element C or respectively D can print the positions 13 to 20 incl. or respectively 19 to 30 incl. This therefore implies that, for example, the positions 7 to 12 can be printed both by printing element A and by printing element B. As a result of this, the assemblies of pixels which are covered by the different printing elements will overlap each other, as a result of which the strip pattern described above is suppressed and as a result of which optical variations in density are smoothed out. It will be clear that the method according to the invention is not limited to a printing stroke which is substantially equal to twice the printing element pitch. The printing stroke may also describe a length of more than twice the printing element pitch. But the printing stroke may also be only a fraction larger than the print ing element pitch in a manner such that there is only a strip of two or more pixels which are covered by several printing elements. In this exemplary embodiment the end positions 1 to 6 incl. and 25 to 30 incl. are only ser viced by one printing element because of technical limi tations. For each of the pixels to be printed there is generated a first control signal which, depending on the pixel print value, represents a quantity of energy or the time within which energy is supplied to a printing ele ment the quantity of energy which is supplied per unit time is then fixed in this latter instance . In view of the fact that several printing elements are now covered according to the invention, the quantity of energy or time stored in that first control signal should be dis tributed over one or more of the printing elements which cover the relevant position. The method according to the invention provides several options for this purpose, such as the determination per position of weighting factors for each printing element or for p of the m printing elements which cover the position, or the establishment of a fixed distribution pattern in which a series of positions to be printed are assigned to each printing element, which series of positions is then distributed over the path described by the relevant printing element. A boundary condition for the determination of that weighting factor P In an analogous manner to that in which weighting factors are determined for the distribution of the energy, it is also possible to determine a distribution pattern for the selection of p of m printing elements. Making use of a probability distribution is, of course, only one way of generating weighting factors. An other way of assigning weighting factors is depicted in Figure 4f. In this case a weighting factor which represents a portion of the energy is assigned per position to the printing elements which cover that position. Thus, for example, for position 14, which is served both by printing element B and printing element C, a weighting factor of 2 3 is assigned to the printing element B and a weighting factor 1 3 is assigned to the printing element C. In printing the position 14, 2 3 of the energy of the first control signal is then fed to the printing element B and 1 3 of the energy to the printing element C. The sum of a series of weighting factors per position is in this case chosen as equal to 1. Of course this sum may also be somewhat larger than 1, for example, weighting factors of 0.6 and 0.5 for one position are also permissible. The total energy supplied to all the printing elements which service that position may be somewhat larger than the energy from the first control signal because allowance is made, for example, for heating up effects in the various printing elements. The series of weighting factors is, for example, stored in the memory of the printing device, which memory then fulfils the function of a distribution pattern gen erator. Figure 5 shows the operations carried out in a first preferred embodiment of a method according to the invention on the basis of a flow chart. In this first preferred embodiment use is made of a probability distribution for the generation of the weighting factors. It is assumed that printing is only done in a single color for example black . The printing of several colors will be dealt with later. As already noted in the description of Figure 2, the printing head is controlled by a CPU. In order to print a image which is composed of dot shaped or line shaped image elements, a suitable program for this purpose is called up from the memory and started 20 under the control of the CPU once a user or a data processing unit has given the necessary instruction. At the start of the execution of the program a line counter, which counts the number of lines to be printed, is set to a starting position, for example the zero position. A weighting factor is then determined on the basis of a probability distribution for each position situated within the line to be printed. The weighting factor is determined, for example, on the basis of a delta distribution such as depicted in Figure 4e. These weighting factors are generated by a distribution code generator which is part of the CPU and the read memory. The generated weighting factors for each position are stored in the read write memory. After the generation of the weighting factors an index flag is set to the zero postion 23 . This index flag serves to indicate within which position ranges the printing head is located. Thus, in the exemplary embodi ment in which the printing stroke extends over substan tially twice the length of the printing element pitch, the index flag has two positions, viz. the position 0 for the first half of the printing stroke and the position 1 for the second half of the printing stroke. Then the information to be printed in the first line is called up 24 for example, via the input output interface or from the memory , and on the basis of the information to be printed there is called up a series of first control signals I where o stands for acts on this may be a logic AND operation or a multiplication . The result of this opera tion produces a second control signal S Then, in step 27 the printing elements are activated under the control of the second control signals S However, since the printing head has already been displaced over a number of positions, this should be taken into account in determining the second control signals. To this end a shift operation 32 is carried out on the first control signals in the printing table and on the weighting factor in the memory. Again referring to the example in Figure 4, this means that the positions 7 to 30 incl. are now being covered. Printing element A now covers the positions 7 to 12 incl., printing element B the positions 13 to 18 incl., printing element C or D the positions 19 to 24 incl. or 25 to 30 incl. respectively. Thus, the shift operation is actually a modulo 6 shift operation so that, for example, I₇ is now denoted as I₁ and P₇ is denoted as P₁. This is necessary be cause a return will be made to step 25 where the position counter is again set to a starting position and to step 26, where the operations described for it are performed again. Subsequently 34 , the printing head is displaced to an adjacent position and the index flag is set to a new position 35 , in this example the position 1 . The program is then resumed from step 25. The various subsequent steps are repeated for the positions to be printed in position 1 of the index flag. However, at step 30, where a check is made as to whether the index flag is in the position 0 , the answer will now be nega tive and this being so, step 38 will be proceeded to at this point. In this step 38 a check is made as to whether all the lines to be printed have already been covered. This is undertaken, for example, by interrogating the posi tion of the line counter and checking whether a previously set position which specifies the number of lines to be printed has already been reached. If all the lines to be printed have been covered Y , then the printing process is terminated 39 . If, however, all the lines to be printed have not yet been covered N , a return stroke pulse is supplied 36 to the printing head which sets it to its starting position and the paper is displaced so that a next line can be covered. Then 37 the line counter is changed by one position increased or reduced and the method is repeated from step 22 for the next line to be printed. In the event that color printing has to be done, the program has to be modified in a few respects. Thus, for example, in step 24 only that information which re lates to the color to be printed is called up, and only first control signals are determined for the relevant color. If, for example, a colored video image is being printed, the recognition of the colour to be printed can be derived from the RGB signals. The program as depicted by the flow chart in Figure 6 is then executed for each of the primary colours RGB. It will be clear that the flow chart depicted in Figure 5 only provides an exemplary embodiment, to which the invention is not restricted. Thus, it is also possible, for example, to make another choice of probability dis tribution and or to choose a printing stroke of more than twice the length of the element pitch, in which case the index flag has more than two positions. The positions of the index flag can then be indicated and updated, for example, by means of an adjustable counter. In another embodiment of a method according to the invention it is possible, for example, to print in a first position of the index flag during the forward stroke of the printing head and to print in a second position of the index flag during the return stroke of the printing head. The use of a probability distribution is only a preferred embodiment of a method according to the inven tion. It is also possible to choose a fixed distribution pattern method 1 as will be described below. With a fixed distribution pattern, which printing element will service a position to be covered is permanently estab lished. An example of this is illustrated in Figure 6, in which Figure 6a again depicts a known printing head of a thermal printer with six printing elements A, B, C, D, E, F . Figure 6b shows the 24 different positions which are covered during one printing stroke. In this example, during one printing stroke, the printing head moves over a distance which is substantially equal to three times the element pitch this latter point therefore implies that the index flag has three positions . The positions which are covered by the various printing elements during a printing stroke are represented by means of line segments in Figure 6e. The letter associated with the line segment indicates the printing element. Thus, the positions 1 to 9 incl. are covered by printing element A. Figure 6c, 6d and 6e show a first, second and third preferred embodiment respectively of such a fixed distribution pattern. In the Figures 6c, 6d and 6e the letters underneath the various positions as shown in Figure 6b indicate which printing element of the printing head services the various positions. If the distribution pattern as depicted in Figure 6c is chosen, then the successive positions 7, 8 and 9, for example are in each case serviced by a different printing element, viz. C, A and B. This also applies to the positions 10 to 18 incl. Figure 6e shows a distribution pattern in which the printing elements are energised alternately within a strip. Because successive positions are now serviced by different printing elements, effects due to geometric inaccuracies in a printing element are averaged out and the printing elements are allowed some time to cool down between successive activations. The distribution pattern stipulating which print ing element will service a position during the printing is, for example, stored in the memory of the printing device, which memory acts as a selection unit for the selection of one of m printing elements. The printing of the information by making use of a fixed distribution pattern will now be described on the basis of the flow chart in Figure 7. It is again assumed that only one color is being printed. After the printing process has been started 50 , a line counter, which counts the number of lines to be printed, is set to a starting position, for example the 0 position. Subsequently 52 , the information to be printed in a first line is called up under the control of the CPU, and on the basis of the information to be printed a series of first control signals I If the distribution pattern in Figure 6d is chosen, the second control signals for the starting position of the position counter are The second control signals ensure that all the allocated printing elements are energised at the respec tive positions. For these positions the intensity of the second control signal is therefore equal to that of the first control signal. After the determination of the second control sig nals, the printing elements are activated 56 under the control of the second control signals for printing the information. Referring to the example chosen, in the starting position of the position counter, only the ele ments A and B are activated since the other second con trol signals S₇, S₁₀, S₁₃, S₁₆ have a value of 0. This is because the positions 7, 10, 13, 16 are not being selected by the printing elements which are located in these positions at this instant for example, position 7 is serviced by printing element A which is now in position 1 . Subsequently 57 the setting of the position coun ter is increased by 1, and then 58 a check is made as to whether all the positions in the line have been covered. If this is not the case N the printing head is displaced 59 and the printing program is repeated from step 55 for the next positions to be covered. Again referring to the example, these are the positions 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 and 17. The second control signals are now The steps 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 are repeated until it is established at step 58 that all the positions of the line to be printed have been covered. If all the positions have been covered Y , a check is made 60 as to whether all the lines to be printed have been covered position of line counter . If all the lines to be printed have been covered Y , the printing program is terminated 63 . If not N , a return stroke impulse is transmitted to the printing head 61 which sets it to the starting position and the paper is displaced. Then 62 the set ting of the line counter is changed by 1 increased or decreased and the printing program is repeated from step 21 for a following line to be printed. Such a distribution pattern for assigning m printing elements to each position which is covered by m printing elements is either predetermined and stored in a memory or generated by means of a distribution pattern generator composed of the CPU and the memory . Preferably, this distribution pattern is the same for every image line, which simplifies the control of the printing process. The distribution pattern generator operates, for example, by making use of a probability value distribution. In determining this distribution pattern, several printing head parameters can be taken into account. These parameters are, for example, geometrical faults in the printing head, heating up and cooling down effects, dif ference from head to head in the resistance values of the various printing elements. Of course, in determining the distribution pattern account must be taken of the length of the printing stroke to enable all the positions to be serviced. To determine the distance over which the printing stroke extends, it is advantageous to choose this distance as a whole multiple of the printing element pitch n printing element pitch . An upper limit for the value of n is determined, for example, by choosing n as not larger than the number of positions within one element pitch. A favorable solution for a printing head with six print ing elements and a printing element pitch of 4 is, for example, a printing stroke of 4 the printing element pitch.
