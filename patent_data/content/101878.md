# COMBINATION PROCESS FOR UPGRADING REDUCED CRUDE

## Abstract
In a reduced crude conversion the catalyst is regener ated with mixture of oxygen enriched gas and H₂O either as steam or preferably as water to provide additional expansion and facilitate fluidization, while converting coke on catalyst to CO and H₂ with minimum CO₂ formation. The CO can be combined with hydrogen to produce methane, methanol or Fischer Tropsch liquid hydrocarbons or can be passed through the reduced crude conversion operation as lift gas, or as cooling medium or subjected to water gas shift to produce addition H₂.
