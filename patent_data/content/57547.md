# Stabilized core injection molding of plastic.

## Abstract
A method of injecting moulding is provided which con sists of, injecting a first plastics material 101 into a mold cavi ty 103 so that the mold cavity is not filled, injecting a second plastics material 102 into the mold cavity 103 , subsequent to injection of the first plastics material so that it fuses with the previously injected first plastics material, cooling the fused unit and ejecting it once solidified. The injection of the first plastics material 101 stabilises the mold core 105 by impeding movement of the core caused by injection of the second plas tics material. This enables the dimensions of the plastics pro duct 112 to be controlled.
