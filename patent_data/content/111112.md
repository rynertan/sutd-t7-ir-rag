## Description
GRANULAR PESTICIDAL COMPOSITIONS COATED WIE HYDROPHOBIC SOLID WITH ATTENDANT REDUCED DERMAL TQXICITY The invention relates to phosphorus pesticidal compositions, and method of preparation thereof, which are characterized by having reduced mammalian dermal toxicity and extended soil residual toxicity.Compositions of the invention contain either 0,0 diethyl S f l,l dimethylethyl thio methyl phosphorodithioate or 0,0, diethyl S ethylthio methylphosphorodithioate, both of which are well known organophosphorus pesticides. In addition to the selected pesticide, compositions comprise a suitable granular carrier, a glycol type deactivator, and a hydrophobic coating material. It is well known that the phosphorus containing pesticides 0,0 diethyl S l,l dimethylethyl thio methyl phosphorodithioate and 0,0 diethyl S ethylthio methylphosphorodithioate are both highly effective toxicants for the control of a broad spectrum of insects and other pests which attack and damage agriculturally important plant crops. The former pesticide is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,596,076 and a reduced toxicity composition is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,059,700.The latter pesticide is described in U.S. Patent No.2,759,010. Although these phosphorus pesticides are capable of advantageous agricultural utilization, they are unfortunately toxic to mammals. These pesticides are notably toxic when introduced into the human circulatory system either by ingestion, inhalation, or dermal absorption. The utilization of 0,0 diethyl S l,l dimethyl ethyl thio methyl phosphorodithioate or 0,0 diethyl S ethylthio methylphosphorodithioate as pesticides represents a potential hazard to individuals engaged in the application, storing, transpor tation, distribution or other uses of these chemicals. Commercial preparations of these pesticides often employ various granular carriers in which the toxicant is adsorbed or absorbed onto or into the carrier. These granular carrier compositions provide a more dilute composition of the active pesticide for appropriate applications in agronomic uses, and also serve to attenuate the potential use hazard by reducing potential dermal absorption.Even though such formulated compositions tend to reduce the potential hazard of dermal absorption of these pesticides, it is desirable to further reduce this hazard. It has been found that when solid granular compositions containing an aforementioned pesticide are treated with certain inert finely divided hydrophobic silicas, or with other inert finely divided water repellant solids, the resultant hydrophobic solid coated compositions possess advantageously a 1.2 to 2.4fold margin of safety due to their lowered mammalian dermal toxicity when compared to similar, uncoated compositions. Pesticidal activity and physical integrity remain unimpaired. These effects are accomplished by applying certain finely particulated hydrophobic silicas or other hydrophobic solids to the surfaces of said impregnated pesticidal granules. It has also been unexpectedly discovered that pesticidal compositions of the present invention advantageously have increased soil residual toxicity when compared to analogous non coated compositions. Conveniently, the coated granular compositions of the invention are prepared in a plurality of steps.Prior to hydrophobic solids coating, a suitable granular carrier is impregnated with about 2 to 15 by weight of the toxicant 0,0 diethyl S f l,l diethylmethyl thio methyl phosphorodithioate, wherein said carrier is used in amounts of about 72 to 95 by weight preferably about 78 to 94 of formulation. Illustrative of said carrier is either a a sorptive material, such as attapulgite or montmorillonite clays , brick chips, pumice, talc, volcanic cinders, corncob grits, or b a non sorptive material, such as sand or limestone chips. With some types of sorptive material i.e.,clays a deactivator such as ethylene glycol, di , tri , or tetraethylene glycol and mixtures thereof can be added to neutralize the intrinsic acidity of said material, in amounts ranging from 3 to 6 by weight of compositions.If a deactivator is incorporated into the formulation, it may be conveniently preblended with the toxicant and then sprayed on the granular carrier while the latter is being agitated. After the spraying has been completed, blending of the mixture is continued until all of the liquid is absorbed. Thereafter, about 2 to 7 preferably 2 to 6 by weight of a finely divided, inert, hydrophobic solid is added, and agitation of the mixture is continued until a uniform blend is obtained.Preferably, said hydrophobic solid is silica which has been made hydrophobic by methyl groups bonded chemically to its surface. One silica suitable as Åa hydrophobic coating material is characterized by having a BET surface of 100 20 m2 g average particle size of 16nm bulk density 50 ml 100g moisture 0.5 ignition loss two hours at l0000C 2 contains approximately 1 chemically bonded carbon pH 3.5 to 4.4 4 slurry in 1 1 methanol Brunear, Emmett and Teller H20 99.8 SiO 0.05 A1203 0.01 Fe203 0.03 TiO2 0.05HCl. The formulations so prepared are characterized by lowered mammalian dermal toxicity without any loss of insecticidal activity. If so desired, the thus coated granular pesticidal compositions may be over sprayed while being agitated with a polyvinyl acetate emulsion in amounts of about 0.25 to 3.0 preferably 0.5 to 2 by weight of formulation to minimize dusting normally associated with such compositions. Alternatively, the granular carriers which have been impregnated with a liquid toxicant, or toxicant deactivator mixture, may be oversprayed with a polyvinyl acetate emulsion prior to the application of said finely divided, inert, hydrophobic solid, to anchor same to said granules. The polyvinyl acetate emulsion is characterized by having 60 1 solids content by weight a pH range of from 4 to 6 at 250C and a viscosity range of from 1800 to 3800 cps as measured by a No. 4 spindle Brookfield at 60 rpm. Thus, the coated granular pesticidal compositions of the present invention show reduced mammalian dermal toxicity They also show increased soil residual activity when compared to analogous non coated pesticidal compositions. The following Examples illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 1Preparation of coated granular pesticidal compositions having lowered dermal toxicity. The required amount of a designated granular carrier is agitated in a suitable blender. While in motion, the granules are sprayed with a mixture comprising a blend of the toxicant with a glycol type of deactivator Brunaer Emmett and Teller i.e. ethylene glycol, di , tri , or tetraethylene glycol or mixtures thereof . On completion of the spraying, agitation of the carrier is continued until all of the liquid is absorbed by the granules. Next, the required amount of finely divided hydrophobic coating material is added, and the whole is blended until the granules are uniformly coated with said coating material. Additionally, a binding agent may be optionally sprayed onto the above coated granules. Alternatively, said binding agent may be sprayed onto the granular carrier subsequent to the application of the toxicantdeactivator mixture, and prior to the application of said hydrophobic coating material.

EXAMPLE 3General method for the evaluation of dermal toxicity of pesticidal formulations using male albino rabbits as test animals. Five male albino rabbits weighing approximately 2.2 to 3.5 kilograms are selected for each dosage level.The hair is shaved from the entire trunk. The following materials are used in dermal toxicity tests a. Saran tubing or vinylite film W 1900, 30.5 cm 12 wide, 0.04 millimeter in thickness, and long enough to fit around the rabbit b. Felt cloth bandages measuring approximately 22.9 x 45.7 cm 9 x 18 c. pieces of 3.8 cm 1.5 adhesive tape approximately 35.6 cm 14 long. Granular material to be evaluated is placed in the center of the plastic film and is moistened with water.The rabbits underside is then moistened with water, and the animals are placed, belly down, on. the material. The plastic is then brought up and around the animal and secured at each end with strips of adhesive tape.The felt cloth is then placed under the belly and brought up and around the animal and secured to the body with the remaining two strips of adhesive tape. The cuff is removed from the test animals 24 hours after dosing, and any remaining material is brushed away. If the test material cannot be removed, the animal is fitted with a fiber collar which prevents the animal from licking the treatment area. The animals are then observed for 14 days for signs of toxicity, skin irritation or mortality. After this observation period, the animals are sacrificed and weighed. The dermal LD50 values mg kg body weight are calculated for experimental data for the compositions evaluated. The LD50 values thus obtained are averaged. These results are summarized in Table II below, along with the LD50 value of the toxicant itself, and a granular non coated formulation thereof.

Five male Wistar rats weighing approximately 209 to 277 g are selected for each dosage level. The hair is shaved from the ventral surface of the abdomen. Granular material for evaluation is mixed with an equal weight of water on an aluminum foil backed with a plastic adhesive strapping. This preparation is then applied to the shaven ventral surface of the animal and fastened in place with adhesive strapping. After a con tact time of 24 hours, the strapping is removed and the skin is washed with soap and water. The animals are then observed for 14 days for skin irritation or mortality.After this observation period, the animals are sacrificed and weighed. Dermal LD5O values mg kg body weight are calculated from experimental data for the compositions evaluated. The LD50 values obtained are averaged.

A weighed amount of granular formulation, corresponding to the mg qt kg ba rates indicated inTable IV below, is distributed over the soil. The beaker is then capped and rotated on a mechanical mixer for two minutes 60 revolutions . Two l ounce 30 ml jars of soil are removed for 0 days mortality evaluation with southern corn rootworm Diabrotica undecipunctata howardi larvae.The remainder of the treated soil is divided between two wide mouth pint 475 ml treated paper containers. Each container of soil receives 100 ml of tap water, bringing the soil to near field moisture capacity. A regime of moistening and drying continues throughout the test period. The treated soil plus the untreated control are held in the holding room at about 270C. At weekly intervals the duplicate containers of soil are removed. The soil is then thoroughly mixed and moistened to about 25 moisture holding capacity.At selected time intervals, two l ounce 30 ml jars of soil are removed from each container for bioassay mortality evaluation with southern corn rootworm larvae. In preparation for bioassay, approximately 1 ml of millet seed is distribyted throughout each I ounce sample of soil. Ten southern corn rootworm larvae are then added and the containers are lightly capped. After 14 days in a constant temperature room, counts of larvae are made and converted to percent mortality. Table IV presents results of initial toxicity and length of residual toxicity to southern corn rootworm larvae of a conventional pesticidal formulation and a formulation of the invention. It can be clearly seen from Table IV that the coated compositions of the present invention possess extended soil residual toxicity when compared to analogous non coated compositions.
