Compounds according to the invention may be of use as antibiotics as detailed below or may be useful as intermediates in the preparation of further active compounds or in the purification of active compounds. The compounds according to the invention may exist as individual 5 position isomers or as mixtures thereof. Fu rthermore, other chiral centres may exist in the molecule and the invention extends to all isomers of the compounds individually or in admixture. B preferably represents the group S. R1 may, for example, be a methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl or butyl group such groups may optionally be substituted as set out in more detail below. Etherified hydroxyl substituents which may be pre 1 3 3 sent in R include, for example, groups OR where R is an unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbyl group, e.g. an aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic group or a C attached heterocyclic group, or a silyl group.Thus, for example R may be an unsubstituted alWl, aienyi or alkynyl group which may contain 1 6 carbon atoms, or such an alkyl group carrying a substituted hydroxy group a hydroxyalkyl group having 2 6 carbon atoms an aralkyl group which may have 1 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl portion or an aryl group, such aryl and aralkyl groups preferably being monocyclic a cycloalkyl group, which may have 3 7 carbon atoms a carbon attached saturated or unsaturated 5 7 membered heterocyclic ring containing for example, an oxygen atom or a silyl group having up to 24 carbon atoms which may carry three groups which may be the same or different selected from alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl and aryl groups.In such silyl groups, substituents will preferably be C14 alkyl groups e.g. methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl or t butyl groups. Substituted hydroxy groups as referred to above include acylated and etherified hydroxy groups.

Representative groups R3 include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, allyl, propargyl, hydroxyethyl, ethoxyethyl, phenyl, benzyl, phenethyl, cyclohexyl, tetrahydropyranyl and t butyldimethylsilyl. Suitable acylated hydroxyl substituents include, for example, groups OR4 wherein R4 preferably represents an acyl groupEMI3.1 wherein Y is oxygen or sulphur and R is a hydrogen atom, an aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic group or a C attached heterocyclic group, for example C18 alkyl, C28 alkenyl, C2 8 alkynyl, C312 cycloalkyl, C4 15 aryl C 1 6 alkyl or C4 15 aryl group, which may be substituted or an amino or mono or di substituted amino group . Suitable substituents on the group R c include, for example, halogen, e.g. fluorine, chlorine or bromine hydroxy etherified hydroxy acyloxy cyano nitro azide carboxyl or esterified carboxyl or amino or substituted amino.

Preferred groups of the formula RcCO are those wherein Rc represents a hydrogen atom a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl group, e.g. C1 4, for example methyl, chloromethyl or ethyl groups a substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group e.g. benzyl an aryl group e.g. phenyl or an amino, methylamino or anilino group. Suitable substituents are defined above. Such groups R and R4 may serve as protecting groups for the hydroxyl group during the intermediate stages of the synthesis of the compounds of formula I . The protecting group may if desired, be removed, for example by solvolysis, e.g. by mild acid or base hydrolysis, to yield the compounds of formula I in which R1 carries a free hydroxyl group. Examples of such protecting groups include those in which R is a tetrahydropyranyl, 1 ethoxy ethyl or silyl group or R4 is a formyl or dichloroacetyl group. When R 2a represents a carboxyl esterifying group, it may for example be an organic group derived from an alcohol aliphatic or araliphatic , a phenol, a silanol or a stannanol. Such an alcohol, phenol, silanol or stannanol used to esterify the carboxyl group preferably contains not more than 24 carbon atoms. 2a Thus, the group R may represent a straight or branched unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or alkenyl group, preferably having from 1 8 carbon atoms, for example a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec butyl, t butyl or ally group, optional substituents being for example, alkoxy e.g. methoxy halogen i.e. fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine cyano acyloxy, e.g. alkanoyloxy, such as acetoxy or pivaloyloxy, or alkoxycarbonyloxy, such as ethoxycarbonyl oxy acyl e.g. p bromobenzoyl and alkoxycarbonyl e.g. ethoxycarbonyl an aralkyl group having up to 20 carbon atoms especially an arylmethyl group e.g. a benzyl or substituted benzyl group, suitable substituents being halo e.g. chloro nitro, e.g. o or nitro cyano alkoxy e.g. methoxy or alkyl e.g. methyl groups a diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl group or a fur 2 ylmethyl, thien 2 ylmethyl or pyrid 4 ylmethyl group, the heterocyclic groups of which may also be substituted e.g. by a C14 alkyl group, preferably methyl an aryl group having up to 12 carbon atoms e.g. a phenyl or substituted phenyl group, suitable substituents being alo e.. chloro nitro, e.g. p cr p nitro cyano alkoxy e.g. methoxy or alkyl e.g. methyl groups a cycloalkyl group containing not more than 12 carbon atoms e.g. adamantyl, cyclohexyl or cyclopentyl a heterocyclic group containing not more than 12 carbon atoms, the heteroatom being, for example, oxygen, as in the tetrahydropyranyl or phthalidyl group a stannyl group having up to 24 carbon atoms for example a stannyl group carrying three substituents which may be the same or different selected from alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, or aralkoxy groups.Such groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, n butyl, phenyl and benzyl groups or a silyl group having up to 24 carbon atoms which may carry three groups which may be the same or different selected from alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl and aryl groups. Such groups will preferably be C1 4 alkyl e.g.methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl or t butyl groups.

Such salts include alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium, potassium and lithium salts, alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium and magnesium salts, ammonium salts, and substituted ammonium salts. Salts of compounds of formula I also include acid addition salts of compounds of formula I in which the RÚ group contains a basic nitrogen atom.Compounds of formula I in which R2a is hydrogen and R carries a basic nitrogen atom may exist in zwitterionic forms and such zwitterionic forms are included within the present invention. In general acids and metabolically labile esters of compounds of formula I in which B is sul sulphur, and salts of such compounds are the preferred fo ws L t use in medicine. However, other compounds of the invention are also useful, particularly for the preparation and purification of the preferred compounds just referred to and other compounds. Thus for example, where the ester grouping is readily cleaved e.g. by hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis, without significant degradation of the rest of the molecule, the esters are especially useful as carboxyl protectedderivatives of the parent compounds.Those esters which are readily cleaved and are primarily of use in this connection include arylmethyl esters, especially the benzyl, p nitrobenzyl, benzhydryl and trityl esters as well as the stanny2 e.g. tri nbutylstannyl, and silyl esters. As indicated above, the ester grouping may be metabolically labile, i.e. it may be converted into the carboxylic acid during general metabolic processes, e.g. in the blood or liver.Metabolically labile esters include for example acyloxymethyl, e.g. acetoxymethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl, esters and phthalidyl esters. Compounds of formula I wherein B is sulphur and R 2a represents a hydrogen atom or a metabolically labile ester grouping, together with salts of such compounds, in. general possess antibacterial activity.

Compounds of formula I wherein B is S and R2a represent a hydrogen atom or a metabolically labile ester grouping and physiologically acceptable saltsEMI8.1 of such compounds may thus be formulated as pharmaceutical including veterinary compositions which may if desired contain further lactam antibiotics. Such compositions will normally also contain carriers and or excipients and may, for example, be in a form adapted for oral or parenteral administration. Such compositions may thus, for example, take the form of powders, tablets, capsules, lozenges, oiu . no and syrups suitable for oral administration, and aiay include, for example, starch, lactose, talc, magnesium stearate, gelatin, distilled water and suspending, dispersing, emulsifying, flavouring or colouring agents.

Examples of such salts include the benzyltrimethyl sononium and tetra n butylammonium salts. The presence of a base, either organic or inorganic, ma be desirable to accelerate the reaction, to optimise yields and to curtail excessive acidity. It is in general preferred to use as weak a base as possible which is effective in the reaction. Suitable bases for use in the rea.tion include amine bases, for example, tertiary amine basks, e.g. trialkylamines, preferably those wherein the alkyl groups have from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as triethylamine, hindered bases such as 3 azabicyclo 312,2 nonane or aromatic bases such as pyridi,ne.

Where R5 represents a group of formula N RxRyRz, the reaction with hydrogen sulphide or a hydrosulphide or sulphide salt is preferably carried out at temperatures of from 30 to 30 C, The reaction is completed by cyclisation to form a penem of formula I by heating. The cyclisation reaction is preferably effected above 40 C e.g. at 50 to 100 C. Following the reaction with the compound of formula II wherein R5 represents a group of formula N RxRyRz with the hydrogen sulphide or hydrosulphide or sulphide salt, it may be possible to isolate a thioenolate of the formula IIa EMI12.1 wherein RX, , RZ, R1 and R have the above meanings . On heating, e.g. in a solvent such as ethyl acetate, the compound of formula IIa cyclises to the desired penem.of formula I . Cyclisation may if desired be carried our presence of an acid scavenging agent, e.g. an inorganic base such as solid, anhydrous sodium, potassium or calcium bicarbonate. In the compound of formula II , when R represents a halogen atom it is preferably a chlorine or bromine atom. In the case that R5 represents a group of formula N RxRyRz there will be an anion A e associated with the compound of formula II . In general the anion A will be derived from the reagent used for the introduction of the group R e.g. a halide ion such as a chloride ion, as described hereinafter. Where R5 represents a group of formula N Rx, RY and RZ may, for example each represent an alkyl group having up to 8 carbon atoms, e.g. a C16 alkyl group preferably a C14 group, an aralkyl group having up to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl portion or an aryl group, such aryl and aralkyl groups desirably being monocyclic, e.g. enzyl and phenyl, and such alkyl groups including also ycloaliphatic e.g. C3 7 cycloalkyl groups or two of Rx and R may together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a five , six or sevenmembered heterocyclic ring optionally containing a further oxygen or sulphuratom e.g. a N alkyl piperidinium orN alkyl morpholinium group or RX, RY and RZ may, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, represent a bicylic, non aromatic heterocyclic ring system e.g. a quinuclidinium group, or an aromatic ring e.g. pyridinium.

An example of the latter type of phosphinyloxy group is the groupEMI14.2 Suitable carbonyloxy groups includs, for example, those wherein the aliphatic or aromatic grouping is an alkyl e.g. Cl8 group optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms or an aryl e.g. C6 15 group optionally substituted by, for example, one or more halogen atoms or nitro groups. When R represents a halogen atom, this is preferably a chlorine or bromine atom. Preferred meanings for R include methanesulphonyloxy, trifluoromethanesulphonyloxy,toluene sulphonyloxy, benzenesulphonyloxy, dimethoxyphosphinyloxy and chlorine. The initial product of the reaction between the compound of formula II and hydrogen sulphide or a hydrosulphide or sulphide salt is an ester of formula I wherein B represents a group S. Where a free acid of formula I or a salt of such an acid is required, the ester should subsequently be cleaved. Where an ester of a compound of formula I is required different from that origilially produced, this may be obtained by deesterification followed by reesterification as described hereinbelow. Suitable methods for deesterification are well known in the art. Thus, for example a silyl or stannyl ester may be cleaved by mild solvolysis e.g. by reaction with water, alcohols, phenols or carboxylic acids e.g. acetic acid. Alternatively, esters which are readily subject to reduction, for example, arylmethyl esters such as benzyl, benzhydryl, trityl or more preferably, p nitrobenzyl esters can be cleaved by reduction e.g. 7 .ydrogenolysis, for example using a metal catalyst, e.g. a noble metal such as platinum, palladium or rhodium. The catalyst may be supported e.g. on charcoal or kieselguhr. In the case of p nitrobenzyl esters, cleavage may also be effected by reduction of the nitro group e.g. using a dissolving metal reducing agent such as zinc in acetic acid or zinc in aqueous tetrahydro reran or acetone controlled in the pH range 3 6, preferably 4 5.5 by the addition of aqueous HC1 aluminium amalgam in a moist ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or iron and ammonium chloride in an aqueous ether such as aqueous tetrahydrofuran followed by hydrolysis either under the reduction conditions or by subsequent treatment with acid.Alternatively, a nitrobeniyl ester may be cleaved cy alkaline hydrolysis using, for example, sodium sulphide in a solvent such as aqueous tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or acetone. Where it is desired to produce a salt of the compound of formula I , an acid may be reacted, e.g. in an appropriate organic solvent with an appropriate base, preferably in equimolar quantities and preferably under conditions favouring precipitation of the salt. In the formation of alkali metal salts for example, e.g. sodium or potassium salts, an alkanoate is a preferred base e.g. a 2 ethyl hexanoate. Where the compound of formula I obtained is a compound in which the RÚ group contains a basic nitrogen atom, it may, if desired, subsequently be converted into an acid addition salt by reaction with an appropriate acid. Examples of acid addition salts are those formed wi Sydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, phosphoric, lactic, citric, fumaric and maleic acide. Sulphoxides of formula I according to the invention may be prepared from the corresponding sulphides of formula I by, for example, oxidation with peracids such as peracetic, monoperphthalic, m chloropr benzoic or metaperiodic acid. Oxidation is preferably effected at a temperature not greater than 100C and avoiding excess oxidising agent. Esters of the acid of formula I may, for example, be prepared by reaction with an alcohol, phenol, silanol or stannanol or a reactive derivative thereof to form the desired ester. Reaction will desirably be effected under mild conditions in order to prevent rupture of the bicyclic nucleus. The use of neutral or mild acidic or basic conditions therefore, at temperatures between 700 and 350C IS preferred. The alkyl, alkoxyalkyl and aralkyl esters may be prepared by reaction of the acid of formula I with the appropriate diazoalkane or diazoaralkane e.g. diazomethane or diphenyldiazomethane. The reaction will 1 generally be effected in an ether, ester or a halohydrocarbon solvent, e.g. diethyl ether, ethyl acetate or dichloromethane. In general, reduced temperatures are preferred, for example, 15 to 15 C. The esters derived from alcohols a also be produced by reaction of a reactive derivative of the alcohol, for example, a halide such as the chloride, bromide or iodide or a hydrocarbonsulphonyl derivative such as methanesulphonyl or p toluenesulphonyl ester, with a salt of the acid of formula I e.g. an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt such as a lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium or barium salt or an amine salt, such as a triethylammonium salt.This reaction is preferably carried out in a substituted sulphide or amide sol vent e.g. dimethyl sulphide, dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphoramide or alternatively the esters may b prepared by reaction of the acid with the alcohol in the presence of a condensing agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodi imide. Stannyl esters may conveniently be formed by reaction of the carboxylic acid of formula I or a salt thereof with reactive tetravalent tin moieties. Trialk l tin oxides are preferred for the synthesis of tin compoinds in view of their availability and low toxicity. Silyl esters of the acid of formula I may be formed by reaction with a reactive tetravalent silicon moiety.alkylsilyl halides and mono or bis silylated acetamides are preferred as silyiating agents. Proton acceptors e.g.weak bases such as pyridine may often be used with advantage when hydrogen halide are formed during such esterificaton. Compounds of formula I wherein R carries an i etherified hydroxy group may be prepared by etherification of a compound of formula I in which RÚ carries a hydroxy group. Etherification may be effected, for i example, by reaction of the appropriate hydroxy ester with an alcohol r phenol R OH in which R is a hydrocarbyl or C attached heterocyclic group as defined above or an appropriate reactive derivative thereof. The reaction i desirably effected under mild conditions in order to p event rupture of the bicyclic nucleus. The reaction temperature is preferably in the range 70 to 70 C. According to one method, the hydroxy ester may be react d with a diazoalkane or diazoaralkane. This. reacton will be preferably effected in the presence of aLewis acid such as born trifluoride. The reaction may be zffected in a solvent such as an ether e.g.diethylether, dioxan or tetrahydrofuran, a hydrocarbon e.g. a light petroleum fraction, or a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. dichlc omethane or chloroform. The reaction temperature is preferably low e.g. 150C to 15 C. This method is capable of yielding ethers in which R is an alkyl, alkoxyalkyl or aralkyl group.The ester starting material may if desired be formed from the corresponding free acid by reaction with a diazoalkarb or diazoaralkane reagent and allowed to react in situ wih further reagen. together with a Lewis acid e.g. BF3 to effect the desired etherification. Etheridicl io may also be carried out by reaction of the hydroxyester with a vinyl ether. This method is especially useful or production of tetrahydropyranyl ethers, usir, dihyt opyran as reagent, or 1 alkoxyalkyl ethers such as a l ethoxyalkyl ether, using an alkyl vinyl ether as reagent The reaction is desirably carried out in the presence o , strong acid catalyst, for example a mineral acid such as sulphuric acid, or an organic sulphonic acid such as p toluene sulphonic acid, in a non hydroxylic, sbstantially water free solvent.Examples of suitable solvents include an ether e.g. diethylether, dioxan or tetrahydrofuran, a hydrocarbon e.g. a light petroleum fraction, or a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g. dichlorom ane or chloroform. The reaction temperature is preferably in the range 150C to 35 C .. Silyl ethers may be prepared using the appropriate, silyl halide e.g. trimethyl silyl chloride or t butyldimethylsilyl chloride. Compounds of formula I wherein R1 carries an acylated hydroxyl groupEMI20.1 wherein Rc and Y are as defined above may be prepared by reaction of an ester of formula I wherein R1 carries a free hydroxy group or a corresponding free acid with a compound of formula Y Rc.C.X wherein X represents a readily displaceable substituent or, when Y is oxygen, optionally, a hydroxy group . The reaction will desirably be effected under mild conditions in order to prevent rupture of the bicyclic nucleus. The use of neutral or mild acidic or basic conditions, therefore, at temperatures between 70 C and 35 C is preferred. Thus, an ester of formula I in which R carries a hydroxy group, or a corresponding free acid, may be reacted with a reactive derivative of a carboxylic acid e.g. a halide or anhydride, for example, an acid chloride.In this case reaction may be effected using either the free antibiotic carboxylic acid or, more preferably, an ester thereof, desirably under mild basic conditions e.g. in the presence of a pyridine base in a solvent such as an ether,e.g tetrahydrofuran or dioxan, or ester, e.g. ethyl acetate, or halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. methylene chloride, or substituted amide, e.g. dimethylacetamide. Where a carboxylic acid is used as acylating agent the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a coupling agent such as dicylohexylcarbodiimide. A mono N substituted carbamate may be prepared using e an isocyanate or isothiocyanate of formula R ICY, in which R and Y are as defined above. The reaction will preferably be carried out by allowing an ester of formula I in which R carries a hydroxy group to react with an isocyanate or isothiocyanate, optionally in the presence of a mild organic base e.g. pyridine, to yield the acylated derivative of the compound of formula I . Where it is desired to prepare compounds in whichRd and Re are both hydrogen atoms, these may be prepared from mono N carbamates prepared as described above in which Rf is a group which can be readily replaced by a hydrogen atom as defined above. These groups Rf may be replaced by hydrogen by mild acid or base hydrolysis using, for example, aqueous sodium bicarbonate or dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid. The carbamates may also be prepared by reaction of an ester of formula I in which RÚ carries a hydroxy group with a carbamoyl halide of the formula ReReNCYX where Y is as defined above, Rd an dRe are as defined above other than hydrogen and X is a halogen atom e.g.a chlorine atom preferably in the presence of a weak base as hydrogen halide acceptor. The carbamoyl halide may be prepared by reaction of a carbonyl dihalide such as phosgene with a primary or secondary amine. Alternatively, an ester of formula I in which RÚ carries a hydroxy group may be reacted with a carbonyl dihalide followed by reaction with a urinary or secondary amine. These reactions are most, useful in the preparation of disubstituted carbamates. he compounds of general formula II used as starting materials may be prepared by a variety of methods.Thus they may, for example, be prepared by reaction sequences involving clavulanic acid and its Acrivatives or penicillins as starting materials or they may be prepared by total synthesis. One method of preparing compounds of general formula II wherein R5 represents a halogen atom involves reacting a compound of formula III EMI22.1 wherein RÚ Rê and R6 are as hereinbefore defined and either n is 0 and R9 is a group of formula SR10,EMI22.2 where R is an aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic group or n is l and R is an acyl group or a group of formula is where R is as defined above with the proviso that when n is 1, R1 is a methyl group with an electrophilic halogenating agent. The halogenating agent may, for example, be molecular halogen or an N halo amide or imide. TheN halo amide or N halo imide may include a cyclic system, the amide or imide linkage fcrming part of the cyclic system examples of such N halo amides include N bromo caprolactam and examples of such N halo imides include the 1,3 dibromo 5,5 di lower alkyl hydantoins e.g. 1,3 dibromo 5, 5 dimethyl hydantoin N bromosucc inimide Nchlorosuccinimide N bromophthalimide etc. Other usefulN halo amides include N halo loweralkanoamides e.g.N bromoacetamide. The reaction will preferably be carried out i an inert solvent, e.g. a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example methylene chloride. Molecular halogen, e.g. chlorine or bromine, may, for convenience, be added in solution, e.g. in a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as carbon tetrachloride. Suitable reaction temperatures are from l500C to 25 C. The use of low temperature e.g. below about OQC, has been found advantageous in assisting the control of the reaction. Where molecular halogen is used, it may be desirable to carry out the reaction in the presence of an acid binding agent in order to remove any hydrogen halide as it is formed and thus prevent side reactions. Suitable acid binding agents include amides e.g. carboxylic acid amides such as acetamide, metal carbonates e.g. calcium carbonate, oxiranes e.g. propylene oxide, or molecular sieves. The acid binding agent, when used, will desirably be present in a quantity which ensures as raid removal of hydrogen halide as possible. When R9 represents a group SR10,EMI24.1 in which R1O is an aliphatic group, R10 may be saturated or unsaturated and thus may, for example, be an alkyl or alkenyl group which may contain 1 6 carbon atoms e.g. C14 alkyl such as methyl or butyl, or a cycloalkyl group, which may have 3 7, preferably 5 or 6 carbon atoms. Suc . alkyl groups may, optionally, carry one or more etherified hydroxy groups. When RIO is an araliphatic or aromatic group, it will desirably be an aralkyl group which may have 1 6 carbca atoms in the alkyl portion, or an aryl group, the rings in such aryl and aralkyl groups, preferably being monocyclic, e.g. phenyl and optionally carrying substituents such as C 4 alkyl groups e.g. methyl groups. When R10 is a heterocyclic group, it will desirably contain a carbon attached 5 7 membered heterocyclic ring containing one or more heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen, wrich may be aromatic e.g. ridyl and or carry one or more alkyl groups, for example containing 1 6 carbon atoms e.g. a methyl group or may have a bicyclic structure, an example of such a group a benzothiazol 2 yl group. Where R9 is an acyl group, this may, for example, be an alkanoyl or aralkanoyl group containing from 1 to 20,preferably from 1 to 7,carbon atoms. Especially preferred is an acetyl group. . Specific groups S nR9 which may be mentioned. include, for example, pyrid 2 yldithio C1 5 alkanoylthio e.g. acetylthio methylsulphinyl p tolylthio benzothiazol 2 yldithio C1 4 alkylthio e.g. n butylthio, methylthio and ethylthio benzylthio and C2 5 alk lenylthio groups. Compounds of formula III may, for example, be prepared from compounds of formula IV , EMI25.1 wherein R , R2 R9 and n are as hereinbefore defined by reaction with one or more reagents serving to replace the enolic hydroxy group by, or convert the enolic hydroxyl group into, a leaving group e.g. a halogen atom or an acyloxy or ether group.

Compounds of formula III in which R8 is an acyloxy group may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula IV with an appropriate acylating agent, e.g. an acyl halide or anhydride. Such an acyl halide will desirably b a phosphinyl or sulphonyl halide, the phosphinyl and slphonyl portions being as defined above.

Reaction temperatures are generally from 30 to 30 C, preferably from 15 to 20 C. The reaction will normally be effected in the presence of an acid binding agent, e.g. a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, pyridine or collidine or an oxirane such as propylene oxide. Compounds of formula III in which R6 is an ether group nra, for example, be prepared from compounds of formula IV by reaction with a diazoalkane, e.g. diazomethane, optionally in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as boron trifluoride etherate. The reaction may be effected in a solvent such as an ether e.g.diethylether, dioxan or tetrahydrofuran, a hydrocarbon e.g.light petroleum fraction. or a halogenated hydrocarbon e.g.dichloromethane or chloroform. The reaction temperature is preferably low, e.g. 15 to 15 C. Alternatively a compound of formula II where R6 is as defined above and R5 represents a halogen atom may be prepared from a compound corresponding to formula II but wnere R is hydroxyl, by reaction with one or more reagents serving to replace the hydroxyl group by or convert it into a leaving group, e.g. a halogen atom or an acyloxy or ether group. Such reagents may be of the type previously described in relation to compounds of formula IV . For acylation an acid binding agent will normally be present, e.g. an oxirane such as oxide or a base where Åa base is used, this is preferably a weak base such as pyridine. The compounds corresponding to formula II in whichR5 is halogen but in which R6 is hydroxyl may be prepared from compounds of formula IV by reaction with an electrophilic halogenating agent e.g. of the type described above in relation to the compounds of formula III . The compounds of formula IV wherein n is 0, R represents a group af formula SR10 as defined above andR1 represents an ethyl group optionally substituted in the r position by a hydroxyl, etherified hydroxyl or acylated hydroxyl group may be readily prepared from the compounds of formula V EMI27.1 R2 2 is as defined above and Ria wherein Rê is as defined above and RÚa represents an ethyl group optionally substituted In t e p position by a hydroxyl, etherified hydroxyl or acylated hydroxyl group by reaction thereof with a thiol R10SH, whereinR10 is as defined above. 10 R on will prefeeably be present in excess as compared with the starting material of formula V . The reaction will desirably be carried out in an aprotic organic solvent, e.g. an ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran although the thiol may itself serve as the medium for the reaction. The reaction will desirably be carried out at or above ambient temperature, e.g. at from 20 to 90 C. The compounds of formula V may be prepared from compounds of formula VI EMI28.1 wherein Rib is an ethylidene group optionally substituted in the R position by a hydroxyl, etherified hydroxyl or acylated hydroxylgroup and R2 has the above meanings as described in Belgian Patent No. 858515. Compounds of formula II wherein R5 repr PrIts a group of formula 9RXRYRZ may be prepared by reaction of compounds of formula VII EMI29.1 where RÚ, Rê, Rx, Ry and Rz have the above meanings by reaction with an appropriate reagent serving to introduce the group R6. The introduction of the groupR6 may be effected by the procedures described above for the formation of compounds of formula III . In particular, the compound of formula VII may be reacted with a sulphonylating agent e.g. a methanesulphonylating agent such as methanesulphonyl chloride. to form a product of formula if n which R6 is methanesulphonyloxy.In general as mentioned above, an anion A9, , derived from the reagent used for intro.uction of the group R , e.g. a halide ion such as a chloride ion will be associated with the compound of formula II thus formed. The reaction may be effected in the presence f a base for example a tertiary base such as pyridine. The latter may serve as solvent or a further solvent my be present1 e.g. a halogenated hydrocarbon such a methylene chloride or 1,2 dichloroethane. If desired such a compound of formula VII my be used in the presence of pyridine to prepare a formula II in situ which compound may then be directly cyclised to a compound of formula I by addition of tri ethylamine and passing in hydrogen sulphide. Heating, e.g, to about 70 C completes the reaction. were a compound of formula IIa is prepared from a compound of formula VII Without isolation of the compound of formula II , the com pound of formula IIa may be partly in the form of an acid addition salt with an acid HA where A is as defined above such as HCl. Compounds of formula VII may, for example, be prepared by reaction of a compound corresponding to formula II in which R5 is halogen but in which R6 is hydroxyl group with a tertiary base NRXRYRZ in the presence of a solvent such as ethyl acetate at temperatures of from 0 to 300C, preferably at ambient temperature. Xi Compounds of formula viz in which RÚ represents ethyl group optionally substituted in the ss position by a hydroxyl, etherified hydroxyl or acylated hydroxyl group may alternatively be prepared by reaction of a compounds, of formula VI with a base NRxRyRê as described in Belgian Patent 858516. l Clavulanic acid i.e. the compound of formula VI wherein RÚb is 2 hydroxyethylidene and Rê is hydrogen is well known from the literature. The esters thereof described in, for example, German OLS 2657081 and SouthAfrican Patent Specification No. 76 1953.

It should be noted that in the above reaction sequences and those described hereinafter the group R may be modified between the various reaction stages set out, although remaining within the stated definition. Thus, for example, it will be appreciated that where RÚ carries a hydroxyl group then it may be necessary to protect this group during certain stages or the reaction sequence . By way of example, it is possible to start with a clavulanic acid ester of formula VI in which Rib carries a hydroxyl group and either at that stage or at a later stage, etherify or acylate the hydroxyl group in order to produce eventually a compound of formula I in which RÚ carries an etherified or acylated hydroxyl group. Similarly, in producing a compound of formula I in which RÚ carries a hydroxyl group, it may be convenient tq. conduct certain reaction stages with the hydroxy group in the form of a protected hydroxyl group, e.g. an etherified or esterified hydroxyl group, and subsequently deprotect to yield the free hydroxyl group.The RÚ group may be modified between the various reaction stages. by methods analogous to those described above for the trodification of RÚ in the compounds of formula I ..
