# A process for reducing the width of a flat metal product by rolling.

## Abstract
To reduce the width of slabs from a reheating furnace 140 to the width required in a finishing rolling train 144 , thereby making it possible to feed slabs of only one width, or only a few widths, into the reheating furnace 140 , the inven tion proposes rolling the slab in a width reducing roll train 147 in which the slab is subjected to traction such that plastic deformation occurs between the roll sets. In particular the width reducing roll train 147 has only one set of thickness rolls and has one or more sets of width rolls, thereby minimis ing the length of the roll train 147 and consequently reducing the lengths at the ends of the slab which are not subjected to the traction.
