# Annular slot antenna.

## Abstract
A microstrip annular antenna structure is formed by four quarter wavelength microstrip radiator patches arranged in a quadrant formation and having outwardly directed adja cent radiating apertures which together provide a composite annular radiating slot extending about 360 of azimuth. All such radiators are fed in phase by a single centrally located feedpoint 22 and equal length microstrip transmission lines 26 extending diagonally therefrom to a respective matched impedance feedpoint 24 associated with each radiator patch structure. An extremely low profile rf antenna system results with a monopole or annular slot vertically polarized radiation pattern.
