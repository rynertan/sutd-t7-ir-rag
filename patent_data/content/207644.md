# Fluid contactor elements of thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers.

## Abstract
Improved fluid contactor elements are formed by mold ing a composition consisting essentially of a self reinforcing thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer. In preferred embodi ments, the liquid contactor elements are formed by injection molding from compositions consisting essentially of such polymers selected from the group consisting of wholly aro matic polyesters, aromatic aliphatic polyesters, wholly aro matic poly ester amides , aromatic aliphatic poly ester amides , aromatic polyazomethines, aromatic polyester car bonates, and mixtures of the foregoing. These materials have been found to provide a combination of high strength, high rigidity, high contact area, high specific volume, relatively low unit weight, and high resistance to corrosive chemicals and organic solvents, even at elevated temperatures and press ures. In a preferred embodiment the improved fluid contactor elements of the present invention are free of reinforcing agents and filler materials. The contactor elements provided herein have been found to be superior to similar elements molded of ceramics or prior art polymeric compositions for many chemical process applications.
