# Composite heat insulating material containing a cellular urethane.

## Abstract
A sheet of a polymer comprising at least 50 mol of units of an olefin or styrene eg. a polyethylene or ABS copolymer is coated on one surface with an aqueous solution or dispersion of an adhesive comprising 20 to 100 wt of the solids of a polyolefin having carboxyl groups e.g. a salt of an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer . The adhesive optionally contains up to 80 of a N containing water soluble antistatic polymer and or up to 2 of a F containing surfactant. The opposite surface may be coated with a surfactant. The adhesive layer adheres strongly to a cellular foamed polyurethane, to form a composite heat insulating material. The polymer sheet can be deep drawn to shape, adhesive coated, placed over the metal pressing of a refrigerator body or door, and the urethane components injected through a hole in the sheet so that the polyurethane is formed between the sheet and the metal pressing and is foamed and adhered in situ.
