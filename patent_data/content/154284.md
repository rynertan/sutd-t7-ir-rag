# DNA coding for a signal peptide and DNA containing the same.

## Abstract
This invention relates to DNA consisting of a DNA base sequence coding for the signal peptide Met Phe Ala Lys Arg Phe Lys Thr Ser Leu Leu Pro Leu Phe Ala Gly Phe Leu Leu Leu Phe Tyr Leu Val Leu Ala Gly Pro Ala Ala Ala and to DNA containing said DNA base sequence. The DNA base sequence coding for said signal peptide includes, for example ATG TTT GCA AAA CGA TTC AAA ACC TCT TTA CTG CCG TTA TTC GCT GGA TTT TTA TTG CTG TTT TAT TTG GTT CTG GCA GGA CCG GCG GCT GCG The desired products in cells can be secreted out of cells by the use of a vector containing DNA consisting of the DNA base sequence coding for said signal peptide.
