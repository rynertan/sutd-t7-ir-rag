# Apparatus for stretching a plastic raw material.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for stretching a plastic raw material 11 having viscoelasticity, such as bread dough or confectionery dough, a linear motor 6, 7 or a built in motor is drivingly associated with rollers 3 which pass around an endless roller path 12 . The drive power of the motor which advances the rollers along an endless roller path is also effectively transmitted, by the friction of the rollers with the raw material or with rails, so as to rotate the rollers around their axes, thereby stretching the plastic raw material.
