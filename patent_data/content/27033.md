## Description
Papermaking Apparatus and Method The invention relates to paper machine clothing and more particularly relates to improved dryer felt components of paper machine apparatus0 Papermaking machines are well known in the art.The modern papermaking machine is in essence a device for removing water from the paper furnish. The water is removed sequentially in three stages or sections of the machine. In the first or forming section, the furnish is deposited on a moving forming wire and water drained through the wire to leave a paper sheet of web having a solids content of circa 18 to 25 percent by weight. The formed web is carried into a wet press felt section and passed through one or more nip presses on a moving press felt to remove sufficient water to fo m 2 sheet having a solids content of 36 to 44 percent by weight.This sheet is transferred to the dryer section of the papermaking machine where dryer felts press the paper sheet to hot steam heated cylinders to obtain a 92 to 96 percent solids content. The clothing employed on the paper making machine must perform a X widely diverse rz ge of functions, according to the position on the machine, i.e., forming, press or dryer section. In view of the diversity of functions, the clothing for use in each section of the machine must be manufactured to meet specific design requirements essential to the particular section. In the absence of meeting the specific felt design requirements demanded in each section of the machine, the overall operation of the machine will be unsatisfactory, Optimum operating lives of the felts will not be achieved, product quality may be adversely affected, machine speeds may be lowered or drying efficiency may be impeded. In the dryer section of the paper making machine, one or more dryer felts are employed as endless belts to support the paper sheet or web in its final drying. The felt aids in drying, controls shrinkage of the web and prevents cockles jhe felt fabric must possess strength, dimensional stability, resistance to chemical and thermal degradation, resistance to abrasion and have a functional permeability. In recent years all monofilament structured fabrics have been developed to meet the above described needs of a dryer felt. Eolf ever, dryer felts fabricated from all monofilament fabrics, have heretofore not been entirely satiswacboy. The previously used fabrics have relatively rough surfaces, which are brought in contact with the paper sheet to be dried. This rough surface can mark the paper sheet. This of course may be highly undesirable, resulting in a high percentage of unsatisfactory paper product. In our invention, the dryer felt employed In the dryer section of a conventional paper making machine is fabricated from an all monofilament fabric of a particular weave which provides an exceptionally smooth surface to contact the paper sheet. As a result, relatively mark free paper product is obtained, while all of the desired advantages of an all monofilament dryer felt are retained. Unexpectedly, the paper drying rate is substantially increased by the invention. The invention comprises, in the dryer section of a paper making machine which includes an endless dryer felt, the improvement which comprises a dryer felt fabricated from a woven fabric which comprises a plurality of sinuous, monofilament yarns forming an upper layer of the fabric, the outer surface of said layer being the per contentin surface of the fabric a plurality of sinuous, monofilament yarns forming a lower layer of the fabric a plurality of sinuous monofilament warp machine directions yarns interweaving with the weft cross machine direction yarns in the upper layer and with the weft yarns in the lower layer, the upper surface of the warp yarns where they pass over the weft yarns in the upper layer forming part of the paper contacting surface of the fabric. 3y way of example, certain illustrative embodi ments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 is an enlarged, cross sectional, side elevation of 2 portion of a preferred embodiment fabric employed in a dryer felt embodying the invention. Figure 2 is a schematic view of a portion of a drying section in a paper making machine. Figure is a fingerprint of the paper sheet contacting surface of the fabric shown in Figure 1 figure 4 is a view like figure 1 but of an alternate embodiment fabric embodying the invention. Figure 1 is an enlarged, cross sectional, side elevation of a porti32 of a fabric 10 embodying the invention0 The fabric 10.comprises a first sinuous layer 12 of monofilament weft yarns 14. The layer 12 forms a periphery of fabric 10 which in side profile shows peaks 16 and valley floors 18. At least two peaks 16 in layer 12 are in a single plane and at least two of the valley floors 18 are in a separate, single plane inside of the plane formed by peaks 1 6e A second sinuous layer 20 of monofilament weft yarns 14 forms another periphery of the fabric 10 which also appears, in side profile, as peaks 16 and valley floors 18 .At least two of the peaks 16 are in a single plane and at least 2 of the valley floors 18 are in a separate, single plane inside of the plane formed by peaks 1o . A plurality of monofilament warp yarns 22 are positioned between the outside planes formed by the peaks 16 and the peaks 16 and interweave with the weft yarns 14, 14 at points between the respective planes of peaks 16, valley floors 18 and peaks 16 , valley floors 18 . Thus, as shown in Figure 1 the knuckles of load bearing warp yarns 22 have peaks 23 which are in the same plane as the peaks 16 and 16 . The peaks 16 and 23 are in a single plane which is the surface plane of fabric 10 which will support the paper sheet 24 when the fabric 10 is fashioned into a dryer felt and employed in accordance with the present invention. Thus, the upper peripheral surface of the fabric 10 which supports paper 24 is tangent to the plane within which tbe peaks 16 of weft yarns 14 and the peaks 23 of warp yarns 22 lie as the paper 24 supporting elements. In the embodiment fabric 10 the.warp yarns 22 within layer 20 and the yarns within the pairs are offset from each other in regard to vertical aligment as they knuckle over the weft yarns 14, 14 . There are, in the weaving pattern, 4 sets of warp yarn 22 pairs. One pair interweaves with every fourth of the weft yarns 14, 14 and the pattern repeats. The monofilament yarns 14, 14 and 22 may be monofilaments of any synthetic polymeric resin.Representative of such monofilaments are monofilaments of polyester, polyamide, polyolefin, polyaramid, polyimide and the like. Generally such monofilaments having diameters of from 8 to 40 mils are advarftageously employed in the fabrics of the invention. The fabrics embodying the invention are heatset to stabilize the fabric and tb set the yarns in their positions relative to each other. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the degree of heat setting required to obtain the desired structure will vary depending on the type of materials used in the yarns 14, 14 and 22. The optimum temperatures, times and tensions employed in heat setting may be determined by trial and error techniques for each type of yarns employed in the fabrics embodying the invention.In general, heat setting may be carried out at a tempera ture within the range of from about 15goy to 3750F for from 15 to 60 minutes. The fabrics embodying the invention may be woven endless or they may be woven flat and the ends joined by conventional seaming methods, known to those skilled in the art. The endless belts so made are readily employed as dryer felts in the dryer section 30 of a paper making machine as shown in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, the paper sheet 24 is held against the steam cylinder 32 by the endless belt 34 of fabric 10 during passage of sheet 24 through dryer section 30. The following examples set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventors of making and using the invention but are not to be considered as limiting. EXAMPLE 1 A fabric embodying the invention was woven with machine direction yarns warps of 0.16 diameter polyester monofilaments in a density of 80 yarns to the inch and cross machine direction yarns weft of the same monofilaments in a density of 48 yarns to the inch0The resulting fabric was heat set until all yarns in the outer surface warps and weft had their outer peaks in a single plane, i.e., as shown by a fingerprint resembling that in Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings, A representative portion of the fabric prepared was subjected to physical testing. The physical proper ties found are shown in Table I, below.

Payer products are unmarked by the contact with the dryer felt0 Pigure 3 is an enlarged Singerprnt, i.e. a diagram of the paper sheet contacting surface of the fabric prepared in Example lo From the Figure 3, it will be seen that although the peaks 16 knuckles of weft yarns 14 provide most of the surface area supporting the paper sheet 24, the peaks 23 knuckles of the warp yarns 22 also provide substartial support for the sheet 24 and the result is an extremely smooth, non marking surface for the fabric and a dryer belt prepared therefrom.The smooth surface has more sheet contact points per square inch for a more even pressure distribution to the paper sheet 24 as compared to conventional monofilament dryer felts. This enhances heat transfer to the paper sheet 24 from the hot dryer can in the dryer section of the paper making machine0 EXMlE 2 Four endless dryer felts are made up from fabric prepared in accordance with the above Example 1. he dryer felts are installed in both top and bottom positions of a two dryer section papermaking machine, and two papermiking runs are made, The ambient conditions under which the runs were made, paper sheet speed, steam pressures and average can and paper sheet temperatures are given in Table 2, below with measurements of the sheet moisture cn entering and leaving the dryer sections.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many modifications can be made to the above described preferred embodiments of the invention without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention. For example, although the layer 12 must have a smooth surface for contact with the paper sheet 24, the lower layer 20 need not have the same smooth outer surface. Thus, the peaks 16 of yarns 14 need not be in a plane tangent to the peaks 23 of warp yarns 22 where they knuckle over the weft yarns 14 . Either of the peaks 23 or 16 can form the outer periphery of the lower layer 20. This embodiment fabric is shown in Figure 4, where component yarns and layers are numbered to correspond to the same parts shown in Fig. 1 for the fabric 10, As also shown in Fige 4, the number of interlacings of peaks 23 over weft 14 can be increased. This will pre vent weft 14 from being as sinuously curved in plane 20 without altering the smooth surface of the face plane 12o Also, the fabric of the invention may be woven to include various stuffer picks, to obtain fabrics of different permeabilities and any multilayer weaves known in the art may be used to weave the fabric used in the invention.
