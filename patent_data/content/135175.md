# Methods for producing optical fiber preform and optical fiber.

## Abstract
A method for producing an optical fiber preform com prising jetting a glass raw material mixture containing at least one phosphorous compound and a fuel gas through a burner, hydrolyzing the raw materials in the flame to form fine glass particles, depositing the fine glass particles to form a porous glass preform, and then sintering the porous glass preform in a stream of an inert gas with removing phosphor us liberated from the preform to produce a transparent optical fiber preform, from which transparent optical fiber preform, an optical fiber having low attenuation at a wavelength of about 1.52 micrometer is produced.
