# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THIN FILM THICKNESS MEASUREMENT

## Abstract
To measure thin film thickness with thermal waves, heating and detection laser beams are focused onto the film at an inspection site 18 . The two laser beams are normal to the surface of the film, and are parallel and non coaxial with one another. The heating beam from an Argon laser 10 is modulated at over 10,000 Hz and focused by an objective 16 onto the film. A probe beam from an HeNelaser 20 is reflected by a dichroic mirror 28 to the objective 16 . Probe beam light reflected from the thin film returns towards the HeNelaser 20 but is reflected by polarising beam splitter 24 through an HeNefilter 30 to a bicell detector 32 from which signals indicative of deflection at the thin film are supplied to a computer not shown for processing to determine the thickness of the thin film.
