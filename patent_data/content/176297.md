# RAW STARCH SACCHARIFICATION

## Abstract
A multi step process is provided for solubilizing and saccharifying granular starch slurries of between 20 and 60 d.s. starch. In a first step, an enzyme mixture exhibiting raw starch hydrolyzing activity is added to the slurry and maintained in contact therewith until at least a substantial portion but less than all of the starch is solubilized. The resulting syrup is separated from the remaining insoluble fraction. In a second step, the insoluble fraction is used to prepare a second slurry containing less than about 20 d.s. starch, and this second slurry is solubilized with a raw starch hydrolyzing enzyme preparation until substantially all e.g., at least about 95 or more of the starch is solubilized. The pooled syrup from the two steps is over about 20 weight percent saccharides, at least about 95 of which is glucose.
