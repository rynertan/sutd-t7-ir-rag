# Improvements in or relating to data transmission systems.

## Abstract
Method and Apparatus for decoding received data signals using Viterbi algorithm decoding in which to reduce the computational time an expansion technique is involved in which the m level signal is expanded into nk expanded vectors, where n is smaller than m, and in which k vectors are chosen from the nk expanded vectors for selection of the level of the received signal.
