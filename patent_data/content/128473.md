# Receiver for optical communication.

## Abstract
A receiver is applied to optical communication using an optical pulse signal carrying data which is cyclically updated. The optical signal is converted to a corresponding electrical pulse signal. The data is extracted from the electrical signal. The extracted data from successive cycles are compared. In response to the result of comparison between the data, a de termination is made as to the number of cycles in which the ex tracted data is at a given value. When the determined number of cycles reaches a variable preset number, a previously used data value is replaced by the given value. The amplitudes of the electrical signal pulses are compared with a reference level. The preset number is varied in accordance with the result of comparison between the pulse amplitudes and the reference level.
