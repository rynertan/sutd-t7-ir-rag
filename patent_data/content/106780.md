# Talking tracheostomy tube.

## Abstract
A talking tracheostomy tube 10 is shown in the preferred embodiment as including an inner cannula remov ably received within an outer cannula. The tracheostomy tube further includes, a first cuff 16 for sealing between the outer cannula and the trachea for substantially preventing air introduced through the inner cannula to escape from the trachea through the larynx. Air is introduced into the trachea above the first cuff by ports 40 directionally drilled through the outer cannula and in fluid communication with a secondary passageway formed by and between the inner and outer cannulas. The inner end of the secondary passageway is formed by a sealing obstruction integrally formed in the inside surface of the outer cannula adjacent the inner end for the sealing receipt of the inner cannula. The outer end of the secondary passageway is sealed by a collar 42 integrally formed on the outer end of the inner cannula which abuts and seals within a recess of a collar integrally formed on the outer end of the outer cannula. The tracheostomy tube further includes a second cuff 18 for sealing between the outer cannula and the stoma of the patient for preventing the secondary air introduced through the ports from escaping through the stoma in the neck of the patient.
