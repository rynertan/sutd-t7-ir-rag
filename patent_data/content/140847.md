# A computer printout and document holding device, formed by composable elements.

## Abstract
On a beam 1 , which constitutes the body of the sheet material holding device, are slidingly mounted, by means of prismatic coupling with wings 1a of the beam profile, one or more hook brackets 2 for hanging the beam 1 to mounting bars 5 which are disposed in suspension filing systems and, respectively, at least two sheet material holding forks 3 by prismatic coupling with wings 1b opposite to the wings 1a with respect to the core 1c of the beam profile. Locking means consisting of a screw, apt to lock the hook bracket 2 to the beam 1 , are on each bracket, and retaining means, generally by friction, are provided between each holding fork 3 and the beam, to prevent the forks from indesirably moving under the effect of the weight of the bound sheet materials.
