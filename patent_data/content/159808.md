# Hydrocyclone separator apparatus.

## Abstract
Hydrocyclone separator apparatus includes hydrocyclone separator s capable of separating light impurities from a pa per making fibre slurry. The separator inner wall is cylindrical with an apertured inlet portion adjacent one end which directs feed slurry in a vortical path along the wall to an enlarged inlet to an axial flow passage adjacent the other end. This inlet has a rim spaced radially from the wall which skims an inner part from the vortex containing predominantly the light impurities into the axial passage from which it is discharged through an apertured outlet portion of the sidewall. The remainder of the slurry vortex passes the rim to be discharged through another apertured outlet portion of the sidewall. The described apparat us also includes manifold structure providing three manifolds having parallel sidewalls with seal lined openings through which the separator s may be endwise inserted to or with drawn from operative position in which the inlet and outlets thereof are associated with respective manifoids. The outer wall of the separator s is reduced in diameter for at least sub stantially half the length thereof to facilitate separator manipu lation and reduce seal wear. One manifold is spaced from the other two by at least substantially half of the separator length to expose the body portion of the separator s for hand manipu lation.
