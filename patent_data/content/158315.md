# LOADING MECHANISM FOR A MAGNETIC DISK DEVICE

## Abstract
An improved loading mechanism for a magnetic disk device comprises a rack 56 provided on a movable plate 33 , and a rotary oil damper 51 provided on a fixed or stationary member 11 and having a gear wheel 54 pro vided thereon, whereby the rack 56 is engaged with the gear wheel 54 so as to control the speed of slipping move ment of the movable plate 33 caused by the force of a return spring 47 . Accordingly, a force of a second magnetic head to collide with a first magnetic head is reduced, and hence damage to a flexible disk or break of a magnetic head can be minimized while the reliability of the system is improved.
