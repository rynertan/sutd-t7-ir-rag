# High impact nylon composition containing copolymer esters and ionic copolymers.

## Abstract
A polyamide composition comprising from about 46 percent to about 94 percent by weight polyamide, from about 5 percent to about 44 percent by weight random ionic copolymer, and from about 1 percent to about 12 percent by weight of an ester copolymer of ethylene and an ester of an alpha,beta ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid. Prefer ably the composition contains a metal cation containing material.
