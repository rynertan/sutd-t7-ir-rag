## Description
This invention relates to factor IX protein, a protein involved in the blood clotting mechanism of warm blooded animals, and its production by recombinant DNA technology. Haemophilia B, or Christmas disease, is an inherited, X linked bleeding disorder caused by a defect in clotting factor IX. Injection of factor IX concentrate obtained from blood donors allows most patients to be successfully managed. However, due to impurities in the factor IX concentrate in use at present, this treatment involves some risk of infection by blood borne viruses such as non A, non B hepatitis virus and the virus that causes AIDS. Despite recent apparent success in the heat inactivation of the virus which causes AIDS, non A non B hepatitis virus remains resistant, see P.M. Mannucci Factor IX DNA was cloned in 1982, see K.H. Choo Factor IX is a plasma glycoprotein which plays an essential role in the middle phase of the intrinsic clotting pathway where, in an activated form, IXa, it interacts with factor VIII C , phospholipid and calcium ions to form a complex that converts factor X to Xa. Factor IX is synthesised in liver hepatocytes where the 461 amino acid long primary translation product precursor undergoes at least two stages of protein processing involving peptide cleavage as well as three distinct types of post translational modification, before secretion into the bloodstream as a 415 amino acid long mature, biologically active glycoprotein. The post translational modifications are the vitamin K dependent carboxylation of twelve glutamic acid residues, the addition of several carbohydrate residues and the beta hydroxylation of a single aspartic acid residue. The first two modifications are known to be required for activity. Additionally, prepeptide and propeptide sequences totalling 46 amino acids have been removed as part of the processing of the precursor to give the mature, active protein. The precursor is not active in the blood clotting pathway. Because of the complex and specialised nature of the processing and these modifications, it seemed probable that the expression of active factor IX derived from factor IX DNA clones, would present great problems. The difficulties of obtaining a fully biologically active factor IX protein are amply illustrated by prior art which has been published between the priority dates and filing date of the present application. L. Wasley Transgene S.A. filed a French Patent Application 8407125 on 9th May 1984 which has been published on 15th November 1985 as No. 2,564,106. There are foreign counterparts, also published, including WO85 05125 Japan, USA and European Patent Application Publication No. 167420A. These specifications describe cloning of the factor IX gene in It is interesting that Transgene S.A. refer to the possibility of transfecting bovine kidney MDBK and monkey kidney VERO cell lines, see page 49 of the French specification of 9th May 1984 and in this connection say in translation The results have been obtained from the cells N1H 3T3 and LMTK the mouse embryo fibroblasts and are actually in progress for the lines MDBK and VERO . However, in the specifications filed at the end of the convention priority year in May 1985, precisely the same statement word for word identical appears. The reasonable conclusion is that there were considerable difficulties associated with the work in progress or that it was not felt worthwhile pursuing further the possibility of using these other cell lines. Transgene S.A. also filed French patent applications on 22nd May and 5th October 1984, from which European Patent Application Publication No. 162782A published 27th November 1985 claims priority. This specification describes expression of factor IX in vaccinia virus and cowpox virus. See also H. de la Salle Production of 50 60 biologically active human factor IX by transfection of Baby Hamster Kidney cells with factor IX cDNA has been reported by S. Busby The subject matter of the present invention was published by D. S. Anson It has now been found possible to produce an artificial fully or near fully biologically active factor IX protein by a recombinant DNA process in mammalian cells without recourse to poxvirus vectors. The full or near full biological activity of the factor IX protein of the invention can be defined in various ways. A preferred definition relates the antigenic activity of the molecule to its clotting activity both relative to the factor IX or normal blood plasma . Thus, in one aspect the process of the present invention provides biologically active recombinant DNA derived factor IX protein having a specified activity defined as the ratio of at least 90 of that of blood derived factor IX, and free from contamination by poxvirus proteins. Alternatively or additionally the factor IX protein can be defined as having a molecular weight of about 57 kilodaltons and free from contamination by precursor factor IX to an extent of more than 10 weight and by poxvirus proteins. Preferably the factor IX protein of the invention is human factor IX protein or sufficiently similar thereto to be acceptable for infusion into human patients suffering from factor IX deficiency. According to an important aspect of the invention artificial factor IX protein is prepared by a process which comprises preparing a recombinant expression vector by linking a factor IX DNA sequence to a promoter sequence effective to express the DNA in a eukaryotic cell and incorporating these DNA sequences in a vector, and introducing this expression vector, Preferred such cells are kidney and liver cells of mammals, including humans. The invention further includes specifically liver or kidney cells, as defined above, especially from the preferred commercially available dog kidney cell line, transfected with a bacterial host, especially a transformation competent The invention is applicable primarily to human factor IX, although it could in principle be applied to animal factor IX. For example, bovine factor IX complementary DNA cloned sequences are described in the NRDC European Patent Application The term factor IX DNA is used herein to mean a DNA complementary to factor IX mRNA or derived from the exon regions of the factor IX gene by artificially removing intron sequences, which would yield upon translation The factor IX DNA employed can be any likely to yield factor IX after modification and will therefore normally include the cDNA complementary to that part of the mRNA which codes for the primary translation product. This includes the sequence coding for amino acids minus 1 to minus 46 designated as PRE and PRO by Anson Conveniently therefore the DNA includes a sequence which codes for the precursor region of the primary translation product lying to the 5 end of that part of the mRNA which gives rise to the mature biologically active protein. For expression a eukaryotic cell or viral promotor is required. The Moloney Leukemia Virus LTR promotor and the SV40 early gene promotor have both been used successfully. The chosen promotor is linked to the 5 end of the factor IX DNA. Ordinarily each will be present initially in its own vector. One of the vectors is restricted to excise the DNA and the other restricted to accommodate transfer thereto of the excised fragment, and the two are ligated. It would be expected that other viral promotors, such as the thymidine kinase gene promotor of Herpes simplex virus or the major late promotor of Adenovirus would be satisfactory. Equally the factor IX promotor could be used but might be less active than the viral promotors. An AAUAAA polyadenylation signal, N.J. Proudfoot and G.G. Brownlee, Nature The vectors referred to herein are conveniently cloned into The expression vector preferably also includes a selectable marker to enable selection of mammalian cells into which the factor IX gene has been introduced. The marker may comprise a prokaryotic DNA transposon sequence linked to a eukaryotic DNA promotor sequence, as for example in the TK NEO gene. In principle the kind of mammalian cell line most likely to be useful in the invention would be a hepatic cell or a transformed cell line derived from a hepatocyte. Unfortunately, none of the standard mammalian cell lines is known to secrete active endogenous factor IX. However, the rat hepatoma cell line H4 11 E C3 ATCC 1600 is known to secrete prothrombin which is gamma carboxylated, indicating the presence of a gamma carboxylase enzyme which might also serve to carboxylate the intermediate protein in the production of factor IX. This cell line has proved successful, but a commercially available dog kidney cell line not known to have any such modification machinery has proved to be even more successful. The cells must inherently possess or be provided with the necessary means of modifying the primary translation product or inactive protein to produce a protein which exhibits substantial factor IX activity. Cells likely to have the gamma carboxylase enzyme are liver and kidney cells. Those which lack it can be supplied with it by cloning the gene for this enzyme by constructing a rat liver cell library, amino acid sequencing of parts of the purified carboxylase enzyme, constructing oligonucleotide probes, probing the library and testing the clones for carboxylase activity and then transfecting the gamma carboxylase deficient cells with the cloned gene. The introduction of the factor IX gene into mammalian cells may be carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. In this method a solution of the DNA to be transfected is made up in disodium phosphate. On the addition of calcium chloride, a fine precipitate of calcium phosphate is obtained in which DNA is trapped. After overlaying cells with this precipitate, some cells take up crystals of calcium phosphate along with the entrapped DNA. Within the cell the calcium phosphate crystals dissolve leaving the DNA free in some cases to integrate into the genome. Other known means of introducing DNA into cells are usable, such as protoplast fusion, W. Schaffner, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.USA The factor IX protein can readily be recovered from the medium in which the transfected cells are grown, without the need for lysis. The protein is preferably purified by affinity chromatography. For this purpose an antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody to factor IX, most preferably one which is anti to a metal ion dependent epitope of factor IX antigen, is attached by conventional means to a support material on a column and the factor IX containing product is adsorbed onto the column. To elute it, an appropriate metal chelating agent, in the case exemplified by Example 3, or a chaotrope, in the case exemplified by Examples 1 and 2, or a disrupting agent can be employed, and it has been found that a mixture of a high molar concentration of urea, say about 6 8M, with an inorganic salt, for example about 0.8 to 1.2 M of an alkali metal chloride, in admixture therewith is particularly useful for this purpose. The following Examples illustrate the invention. The general scheme of the preparation and analysis of factor IX protein is as follows The preparation and analysis of the factor IX protein will now be described in more detail For a detailed understanding of this stage readers are recommended to refer to D.S. Anson The mRNA is 2802 residues long and contains a short, 29 nucleotide long 5 non coding sequence and an extensive, 1390 nucleotide long 3 non coding sequence. The starting factor IX DNA is the cDNA clone cVI described in Figure 1 of the Anson The region from nucleotides 25 to 93 was removed from the factor IX cDNA cVI by digesting cVI held in the plasmid vector pAT153 PvuII 8 with A short 0.1 Kb The 4.9 Kb and 0.1 Kb long fragments were ligated together with T4 DNA ligase, the resultant recombinant cloned in The construction started from the plasmid pTKMol TK1. This is a pAT153 plasmid containing the thymidine kinase TK gene as a marker and the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus MLV Long Terminal Repeat LTR sequences. The plasmid was restricted with A thymidine kinase neomycin kanamycin TK NEO gene was then prepared. Such a gene is described by F. Colbère Garapin The TK NEO gene and part of the amp r gene was purified as a The isolated factor IX DNA from Stage 1 was then ligated into the direction of the mRNA transcribed from these genes. Note for lay readers since the cDNA in the plasmid is double stranded, it is meaningless to specify a direction of the DNA itself. Only one of the two strands would be transcribed into RNA and the arrow indicates the direction of the strand which is transcribed . pAT153 sequences are shown by the narrow filled line 1 , the TK NEO gene by the zig zag line 2 . The factor IX transcription nit, from 5 to 3 , consists of the MLV LTR solid triangles, 3 factor IX 5 non coding sequence open wide line, 4 , factor IX coding sequence filled wide line 5 part of the factor IX 3 non coding sequence open wide lines, 6 and SV40 sequences diagonals, 7 . The total length of the DNA is about 9.0 Kb. The rat hepatoma line, H4 11 E C3 deposited at the American Type Culture Collection as an open deposit ATCC 1600, was transfected with the factor IX expression plasmid by calcium phosphate precipitation, as follows. The DNA of interest was made up in HBS buffer to a concentration between 10 50 micrograms ml ¹. The HBS buffer contains 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na₂PO₄, 5 mM glucose, and 20 mM Hepes pH 7.05. CaCl₂ was added from a concentrated 2.5M stock to a final concentration of 0.125 M. The mixture was left at room temperature for 30 minutes during which a fine precipitate formed. The precipitate was layered onto the washed monolayer of tissue culture cells and left at 37 Cells were seeded at 10 confluency in a monolayer in an 80 cm² flask containing 10 ml of medium MEM, 10 FCS containing penicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin and 100 ng ml vitamin K . The medium was changed every 24 hours and the conditioned medium assayed by an ELISA for human factor IX. The ELISA was done by first binding 0.2 ml of a mouse anti factor IX monoclonal antibody 3A6, diluted 1 in 5000 in 200 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.0 to microtitre wells at room temperature for two hours. 150 microlitre samples of conditioned medium were then bound overnight at 4 The secreted factor IX was tested for its adsorption onto barium sulphate by the procedure of K. Fujikawa Figure 2 of the drawings shows the time course of the secretion of human factor IX by cell line 4A together with the results of the barium sulphate adsorption test. The solid squares indicate factor IX levels, the solid circles the levels of BaSO₄ adsorbed factor IX and the open squares the degree of confluency of the cells. The rate of secretion of factor IX was about 6 ng 10⁷ cells 24 hours. As the recovery of factor IX is not corrected for possible losses in the procedure, it is not clear from this experiment alone whether about 70 of the factor IX has gamma carboxyglutamic acid residues, or alternatively, that the material is all gamma carboxylated and there are losses of about 30 in recovery. The fact that activity correlates well with antigen level see below indicates that the latter is the correct explanation. No factor IX was detectable in lysates of the 4A cells, indicating that there was insignificant accumulation inside the cell. No cross reacting material was detected either in control H4 11 E C3 conditioned media or in cell lysates. Clotting and antigenic analyses of a sample of affinity purified human factor IX from conditioned medium of line 4A cells as well as from a parallel control sample of H4 11 E C3 cells were performed. The human factor IX sample from 1.5 litres of conditioned media from line 4A cells, and the control sample from the same volume of H4 11 E C3 cells were purified by barium citrate adsorption and immunoaffinity chromatography. An anti human factor IX antibody affinity column was prepared by binding the 3A6 monoclonal antibody, purified from ascites fluid by sodium sulphate precipitation, to the support Affigel 10 Biorad using conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Thus the human factor IX sample to be bound was passed twice over the column column volume 0.3 ml and it was then washed with over 100 volumes of PBS, 1 NP40 and a similar volume of PBS, 1 M NaCl, 1 NP40 . Finally the column was then rinsed with 5 volumes of PBS, 1 M NaCl and eluted with a 7 M urea, 1 M NaCl eluant collecting 0.4 ml fractions. The first three fractions were pooled and immediately dialysed overnight against 2 PBS at 4 Factor IX clotting activity was measured, using the one stage clotting assay in which factor IX deficient plasma is used as a substrate see D.E.G. Austen Bovine factor IX antigen was measured in arbitrary units and was assayed by a quantitative ELISA as follows. Dilutions of pure bovine factor IX were diluted in 200 mM sodium bicarbonate pH 9.0 buffer and dried onto microtitre plates. Bovine factor IX was then detected with a polyclonal rabbit anti bovine factor IX antibody and a peroxidase conjugated swine anti rabbit IgG antibody, as for the ELISA for human factor IX previously described. Results of these analyses are shown in Table 1 below The purified human factor IX protein of the invention from 4A cells was found to be active in a one stage clotting assay, giving an activity level of 7 of normal plasma. Only 1 activity was found in the control from H4 11 E C3 cells, and this was presumably caused by the trace amounts of bovine factor IX which were found in both line 4A and control samples. An ELISA was therefore performed for bovine factor IX antigen and this indicated the presence of trace amounts in both line 4A and control cells. Further evidence that the cell line 4A is secreting biologically active human factor IX protein was provided by determining the inhibitory effect on the human factor IX of the specific anti human factor IX monoclonal antibody 3A6 in the clotting assay. Control experiments showed that this antibody does not significantly inhibit bovine or rat factor IX activity at the concentration used. The fact that the activity level, 7 of normal plasma , in the line 4A sample correlates well with the human factor IX antigen level, 6.8 of normal plasma , suggests that the protein is fully active. It was concluded from these results that line 4A cells secrete fully biologically active human factor IX. In this Example a different mammalian cell line, one from a dog kidney, and a different promotor were used. A vast increase over Example 1 in the amount of factor IX produced was achieved. Figure 3 of the drawings illustrates schematically the preparation of recombinant DNA containing the factor IX gene, as described in stages 1 3 below. As in Figure 1, arrows indicate the direction of transcription of the RNA. This is as described in Example 1. pKG5 is a derivative of pSVTKneo, a plasmid expression vector which combines the SV40 early gene promotor and terminator derived from pSV2, see R.C. Mulligan The construction of pSVTKneo is illustrated in Figure 6. The plasmid pSV2 was digested with The unique encoding the restriction sites for 1 microgram of cVI DNA was digested to completion by restriction enzymes The recombinant plasmid pIJ5 9 in pIJ5 9 was introduced into MDCK cells dog kidney cells available from Flow Laboratories Inc., by calcium phosphate mediated transformation, see Example 1. pIJ5 9 contains the TK NEO gene and selection was therefore made for G418 resistance. Cells were grown in DMEM, 10 FCS containing penicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin and Fungizone as well as 800 micrograms ml of antibiotic G418 Geneticin , GIBCO . Three clones obtained from the transfection of one 9 cm diameter petri dish were subsequently transferred into separate wells volume of well 2 ml of a multi well plate and allowed to grow to confluence. When confluence had been reached, the medium overlaying each clone was removed and analysed for the presence of human factor IX antigen. The media from the clones of dog kidney MDCK cells transformed with the recombinant DNA plasmid were assayed by sandwich ELISA see Example 1 . Two clones proved negative, whilst media from the third, labelled clone 593, contained human factor IX antigen at a level of more than 10 ng ml 10 ng ml was the upper limit assayable in this experiment . Furthermore, a sample of medium from clone 593 was adsorbed for 30 minutes in the presence of barium sulphate see Example 1 . After this incubation, the clarified medium was again assayed for factor IX antigen. 100 of the antigen present was removed by this pretreatment indicating the successful gamma carboxylation of factor IX by MDCK cells. In order to test further the factor IX product of clone 593, 50 ml of conditioned growth media were prepared as follows. Five 80 cm² flasks were each seeded with 593 cells in 10 ml of G418 medium. The flasks were left 4 days until they became confluent and the media were then harvested, pooled, and assayed quantitatively by ELISA for human factor IX antigen. The sample contained 60 ng per ml of factor IX, which is about 1.2 of the concentration found in normal human plasma. 50 ml of this material was purified by passing once through a factor IX monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity column as described in Example 1 and the bound factor IX antigen was recovered in 1.5 ml of eluant. This preparation was assayed by ELISA and by clotting assay, as described in Example 1. The results of these assays are shown in Table 2, again as of normal human plasma. The following conclusions can be drawn from the analyses The amount of factor IX antigen produced by cell line 593 under normal growth condition was measured as follows. Cells of line 593 were seeded to a density of 50 confluence in a 25 cm² tissue culture flask. The culture was overlaid with 2 ml of growth medium and incubated at 37 Factor IX antigen was assayed in each sample by a quantitative ELISA assay and the results plotted as shown in Figure 4. It will be seen that the cells at 50 confluence or greater, secrete in the order of 100 ng ml factor IX antigen per day a level equal to about 2 of that found in normal serum . The unusually high value on day 1 could be due to carry over in the inoculum sample and the 200 ng ml value found on day 6 represents the accumulated factor IX of 2 days secretion. In this example, another dog kidney cell clone, clone C6, was isolated, which gave an improved yield of factor IX protein of the invention to that of clone 593 reported in Example 2 above. This improved cell line was grown in Spinner culture over a period of 3 weeks in the absence of antibiotic G418 to establish its utility for producing factor IX protein in large amounts and in a continuous process without the requirement for antibiotic G418, at considerable saving in expense. Factor IX protein from clone C6, purified by a slightly different immunoaffinity method to that described in Example 2, again gave material which was more than 90 biologically active and was shown to have greater than 90 of the rDNA factor IX protein of the invention as the correct molecular weight product essentially identical to authentic blood derived factor IX. This was carried out exactly as described in Example 2, section 4 above, except that 90 G418 resistant clones were obtained from the transfection of ten 9 cm diameter petri dishes. These clones were subsequently transferred onto separate wells of a multi well plate and allowed to grow to confluence. The medium in which the cells were growing was then removed for the analysis of human factor IX antigen by ELISA as described in Example 1, section 5 above. Thirty clones were found to be positive, as judged by having greater than 10 ng ml factor IX. These 30 clones were then seeded into a further multi well plate and grown again to confluence. The medium was again assayed for factor IX antigen by ELISA, after diluting each sample by a factor of 10. Five clones had greater than 100 ng ml of factor IX. These clones were then seeded into flasks of effective surface area 25 cm² and again grown to confluence, followed by assay of the medium by ELISA for factor IX antigen. One clone, designated C6, produced 250 ng ml of factor IX antigen in this experiment, and was judged to be the highest producing cell line. To confirm that the factor IX gene had been introduced permanently into the chromosome of the dog kidney cells, the following test was carried out. DNA was isolated from the nuclei of cells derived from growth in a flask of effective surface area 75 cm² of confluent C6 cells by established procedures Maniatis Initially a 10 ml volume of conditioned medium derived from the growth of C6 cells was analysed for the ability of the factor IX to adsorb to barium sulphate see Example 1 above . In one experiment more than 98 of the material became bound, suggesting the factor IX was essentially completely gamma carboxylated. In further small scale experiments designed to test whether factor IX of the correct molecular weight was synthesised, we assayed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the factor IX protein which was adsorbed by barium sulphate from another 10 ml of conditioned medium. This material was fractionated on a 10 Laemmli polyacrylamide gel. After Western blotting, human factor IX antigen was detected by ELISA using a polyvalent rabbit anti human factor IX antibody Calbiochem followed by development with an alkaline phosphatase linked goat anti rabbit IgG antibody Sigma . After the ELISA a stained band was observed with a mobility indistinguishable from authentic factor IX isolated from normal pooled human plasma by the same procedure. No slower or faster bands were detected and the stained band which corresponded to authentic factor IX was absent in a control sample prepared from conditioned media derived from control non factor IX producing MDCK cells. In a further experiment to test for the authenticity of the factor IX protein of the invention produced from cell line C6, 0.5 ml medium from the growth of C6 as above was immunoprecipitated by adsorption onto beads of Sepharose 4B to which a mouse anti factor IX antibody was covalently attached using cyanogen bromide. Factor IX bound to the beads was eluted by boiling with 1 SDS and 3 2 mercaptoethanol and the solution applied to the origin of a 10 polyacrylamide gel as above. Western blotting was carried out using a mouse monoclonal anti factor IX antibody A7 see section 5 , ¹²⁵I labelled or by ELISA using a polyclonal anti factor IX antibody. Any antibody which reacts with the denatured factor IX obtained by SDS PAGE can be used. Two Western blots from the factor IX protein of the invention produced by cell line C6 were compared separately with Western blots from a normal human plasma and b the plasma of a patient suffering from a rare variation of typical Christmas disease. To explain briefly control b , the patient, coded Ox 3 , suffered from a blood clotting deficiency of the Christmas disease type, despite having a normal level 89 of factor IX like antigen as measured immunologically. Ox 3 s factor IX like antigen is a protein of slightly higher molecular weight than normal factor IX. Recombinant DNA research on Ox 3 showed that his gene suffered from a point mutation at the arginine R codon at the amino acid position 4, see Figure 2 of the Anson The gels for the control Western blots were obtained as follows. The plasma from the normal patient and from patient Ox 3 was concentrated 6 fold by adsorption and elution from barium citrate. 10 microlitre aliquots were boiled in 1 SDS 2.5 2 mercaptoethanol and applied to the origin of an 8 Laemmli polyacrylamide gel. The results showed clearly that the factor IX secreted by the cell line C6 has a molecular weight indistinguishable from the control factor IX of normal plasma, but about 2,000 daltons less than that of the factor IX like protein of Ox 3. Such a molecular weight difference is wholly accounted for by the additional 18 amino acids of average molecular weight, say, 112 in the factor IX like protein of Ox 3. No evidence of a significant amount greater than 2 of aberrant forms of higher or lower molecular weight protein related to factor IX could be seen in the Western blots of the factor IX protein of the invention. Clone C6 cells were seeded at approximately 10 cells per bead onto 2 g of microcarrier beads, Gibco 60 085 12 note Cytodex 3 microcarriers, Pharmacia, have also been used in other experiments in a volume of 400 ml of DMEM, 10 FCS containing penicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin and Fungizone in a commercial Spinner vessel Techne . No antibiotic G418 was added to the medium, preliminary experiments having shown that there was no difference in the yield of factor IX obtained from the clone 593 described in Example 2 above when it was cultured over a period of 14 days including 2 sub culturing steps , whether or not the antibiotic was present in the medium. Samples were removed from the Spinner culture and assayed for factor IX antigen by the ELISA method see above . The concentration of factor IX in the medium rose to a plateau at 6 8 days of 375 ng ml. Replacing the spent medium with fresh medium allowed the cells attached to the microcarriers to synthesise more factor IX, which then reached a concentration of 280 ng ml in the medium on day 12. A further medium change on the day 12 allowed cells to continue to produce more factor IX, reaching 150 ng ml on day 17. It was concluded that clone C6 can produce factor IX over a period of 2 3 weeks from a microcarrier suspension without the need for and expense of the addition of antibiotic G418. This experiment and repetitions thereof show that yields of factor IX are 150 to 200 higher in Spinner culture than in stationary culture flasks, presumably because of the higher density of cells present per unit volume of medium. Two litres of conditioned media from two experiments similar to that of section 4 above were pooled and the factor IX protein concentrated by adsorption on barium sulphate. After elution, the protein was subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography using the mouse monoclonal antibody A7 specific for a metal ion dependent epitope on the light chain N terminal region of factor IX a gift from Dr. K. Smith, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, USA , who also provided the chromatographic protocol. The affinity column was prepared by activation of Affigel 10 BioRad resin using the monoclonal antibody as recommended by the manufacturer which gave a column material with 8 mg antibody bound per ml or packed resin and with a capacity of purification of approximately 4 mg of factor IX per ml of resin . The factor IX sample was loaded at 4 It was concluded from these results that the C6 cells secrete near fully biologically active factor IX protein.
