# FORK LIFT TRUCK

## Abstract
A fork lift truck which has a mast 13 and a sub frame 22 which moves up and down the mast is provided with a carriage 30 which is mounted for sideways movement relative to the sub frame. The sideways movement is achieved by rams 40, 41 connected between the sub frame 22 and the carriage 30 and located to either side of a central region to provide better visibility. The fork mounting is an integral unit to reduce the loss of lifting capacity resulting from add on side shift arrange ments.
