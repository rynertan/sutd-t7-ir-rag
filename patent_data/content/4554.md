# Scanned screen layouts in display system.

## Abstract
A display system having a scanned CRT provides a full screen layout of alphanumeric characters and at least one additional screen layout, eg a split screen layout. A refresh buffer 1 stores data to be displayed in a first sequence of addresses so that when this data is read out by address generator 5, 6 in the first sequence a full screen layout results. A read only translation store 20 may be selectively addressed by the first sequence of addresses to provide a modified sequence of translated addresses. When the refresh buffer 1 is addressed by the sequence of translated addresses a split screen layout of the data results. A selector 21 is operable to address the refresh buffer 1 with either the first sequence of addresses or the sequence of translated addresses. Logic 34, 35, 36 inhibits character display in a blank area between the two halves of the split screen. Attribute decode logic 9, 26 enables different attributes to control screen halves during split screen operation. Read only store 20 is preferably replaced by a read write store when several alternative screen layouts are required. Each alternative screen layout requires a sequence of translated addresses to be supplied to the read write store from a controller.
