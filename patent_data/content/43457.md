## Description
AIR FILM TRANSPORTATION DEVICEThe present invention relates generally to the transportation of objects, such as semiconductor wafers, along a track on an air film and,more particularly, relates to an improved air film wafer transportation system of. simplified construction and having improved stability during the transportation of wafers along a desired track.It is desirable to transport semiconductor wafers on a lubricating film of air or other gas in an effort to minimize physical contact. Generally, transportation of wafers along an air film track entails the use of flat perforated surfaces through which a continuous supply of air under pressure is forced. These surfaces are either a porous sintered material or a material containing an array of small holes.When a wafer is located over the air streams issuing from the holes at the surface, a cushioning air film is formed which supports the wafer. The wafer is moved and maneuvered by the impulse action of air streams issuing from oriented openings.An additional requirement for air film transportation is some means to constrain the wafer during transportation along the air track to prevent the wafer from departing from the track. Various forms of solid constraining means have been used. One such air film transportation system without solid constraining means is described in U.S. PatentNo. 4 081 201 to Hassan et al. The Hassan et al. patent describes an air track making use of an axi radial effect and a Coanda effect which are generated by a track surface construction containing rows of long air feed nozzles separated by evacuating channels. The sides of the passages are inclined toward the axis of symmetry of the track surface and the flat region in which they terminate are bounded on the axis of symmetry side by a smoothly curving surface forming the sidewall of one of the channels.The air film produced by the configuration of the Hassan et al. patent can be considered as a controlled flow volume of an essentially constant film thickness, bounded by the track surface on one side and the wafer surface on the other side. The controlled volume fluid generates forces acting on the wafer of a given weight, in directions both normal to and in the plane of the wafer surface. These forces are a calculated result of the combined effects of the axi radial effect and Coanda flow phenomena. The air film transportation system described in the Hassan et al. patent is capable of moving semiconductor wafers along a track without the need for solid constraining barriers to hold the semiconductor wafer on the track.While the air film transporation system described in the aforementioned Hassan et al. patent has been highly successful, it nevertheless has certain limitations from the standpoints of constructional requirements as well as performance characteristics. Specifically, the system employs a rather large number of long, small diameter, air film feed holes which involves a considerable construction operation. The multidirectional wafer motion control properties produced by the air film represent a compromise between ideal fluid mechanics effects, as associated with a single hole, and the actual lessened effects due to crossinterference flow action between the multiple air film feed holes.Thus, while the resultant air film control forces produced by the aggregate action of the holes is very effective in providing stable wafer trans portation, limitations of this effectiveness still exist owing to the presence of the encroaching cross interference flow effects. From another standpoint, this overall control effectiveness is achieved for a range of air supply flow rates which, however, can be appreciable for certain practical conditions. This is especially the case for large track installations in which substantial air supply requirements would be involved. Thus, in addition to providing an air film transportation system of further simplified construction which is more economical to produce, operate and maintain, it is desirable to achieve this while greatly improving the wafer motion control capabilities of the system.The present invention provides a solution of this problem.A track for transporting objects such as semiconductor wafers on a bed of a gaseous fluid is provided making improved use of an axi radial effect and a Coanda effect.The track surface construction contains rows of air feed nozzles separated by evacuating channels. The rows of holes on each side of the center line of the air track are oriented such that the holes in adjacent rows are spaced longitudinally along the track. The use of longitudinal spacing of the holes in adjacent rows permits the use of a reduced number of holes for the overall track configuration. Surprisingly, the use of spaced holes also provides improved stability for the wafers as they are transported along the track.The air film produced by the configuration of holes used in the air track of the invention provides greatly improved forces acting normal to and parallel to the surface of the wafer being transported along the air track, and improved stabilit y is attained as the wafer is transported along the track. The hole configuration of the air track of the present invention provides an improved result making use of the combined effects of the axi radial effect and theCoanda flow phenomena.Thus, the invention provides a wafer transportation system, which has improved minimal movement of the wafer in directions other than the desired direction of Lransport ation, and features improved simplicity of construction, reduced air supply requirements, and improved stability during transportation of the wafers.Details of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 is a plan view of a section of track for the wafer transportation system FIG. 1A is a plan view of a section of FIG. 1 further il lus trating details of construction FIG. 2 is a side view. of the section of track of FIG. 1 FIG. 3 is a sectional view taken along line 3 3 in FIG. 1 FIG. 4 is an expanded view of a portion of FIG. 1 FIG. 5 is a section taken along line 5 5 in FIG. 4 FIG. 6 is a graph of the flow static pressure vs. distance from the center line of the passageway illustrated in FIG. 4 FIG. 7,taken along line 7 7 in Fig. 1, is a more general view of FIG. 3 and illustrates the forces exerted on the wafer in the normal and planar directions FIG 8 is a graph of the height of the wafer over the track surface as a function of the air supply flow rate FIG. 9 is a plot of the velocity profile associated with the fluid shear force acting on the wafer FIG. 10 is a schematic representation of the planar trans verse force action on the wafers as they move along the track FIG. 11 is a graph of transverse restraining force acting on wafers associated with the motion illustrated in FIG. 10 FIG. 12 is an enlarged view of a portion of the track shown in FIGS. 1 and lA andFIG. 13 is a plan view of a section of track showing a further embodiment of the invention. Referring now to FIGS.. 1 to 3, a semiconductor wafer 12 is transported over a track 14 on an air film fed to the top surface 16 of the track from air manifolds 18 in the track 14 through nozzles with long thin passages 20 arranged in six rows positioned symmetrically around the center line 24 of the track 14. These passages are inclined with respect to the vertical at an angle y in the direction of the centerline and at an angle e in the direction of motion along the track. An exhaust channel 26 is formed in the track 14 on the centerline side of each row of nozzles.These exhaust channels are asymmetrical in cross section in that the wall 28 towards the centerline is vertical and straight while the exterior wall 30 is curved with a radius R and terminates tangentially with the top surface 16 of the track.More particularly, the orientation of the holes in adjacent rows on each side of the centerline of the track 14 is used to provide the benefits of the invention in respect to simplified construction and improved stability. As shown inFIG. 1, the rows of holes may be regarded as pairs of rows with one of each pair located on the opposite sides of the centerline and spaced equidistant from the centerline. The holes in each pair of rows are spaced longitudinally equidistant along the track 14. The spacing distance is denoted by the symbol x . Typical values of x range from about 2,7 mm to about 22,9 mm and are the same for holes in each row. In the most simple embodiment of the present invention, two pairs of rows are used. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, three pairs of rows are shown and the following discussion will refer to the three row embodiment of FIG. 1.It should be understood that more than three pairs of rows can be used but that no substantial benefit is attained and that some of the advantages of simplified construction are lost.Referring to FIG. 1, a further requirement of the improved air track of the invention is that the holes in each row on each side of the centerline are longitudinally spaced from the holes in each adjacent row by a spacing distance denoted by the symbol y . The longitudinal spacing distance y is preferably from about x 4 to about 3x 4 and is most preferably equal to about x 2.The above aspects are further illustrated by FIG. 1A which shows a hole pattern for a typical track segment construction of overall length L. The three pairs of rows are symmetrically spaced with respect to the longitudinal centerline at distances tl, t2 and t3. The holes in each row are spaced at a distance x 2a, and each pair of rows is alternately staggered in a longitudinal direction such that y x 2 a for this particular construction.Thus, the track segment of length L embodies, in effect, a symme Lrical arrangement of longitudinally spaced hole columns a column being defined as a line of holes extending in a direction perpendicular to the centerline , each column spaced at a distance a . The columns contain four holes or two holes in an alternating sequence. The first and last columns are spaced at a distance a 2 from the segment extremities. Thus, a longitudinal but joint assembly of a given set of track segments to effect a larger installation provides a row spacing a at the segment junction regions.The top surface of the track and the wafer are enclosed in a clear plastic cover not shown . This cover is to provide a barrier from dust and dirt and does not constitute a boundary for the movement. of the wafer and the wafers do not contact the cover. For instance, a silicon wafer 83 mm 3.25 inches in diameter and 0.38 mm 15 mils thick can be transported over a track of the type described with sufficient control of the wafer to eliminate the need of wafer guides when the track is constructed and operated to the specifications set forth in the following paragraph.The film hole inclinations r and e could. be the same for all the film holes. This represents one constructiowal situation. If this were the case these angles, for example, would be Y 150 and 6 100. However, marked advantages in wafer motion control can be obtained by changing film hole angles Y and 8 for each pair of rows.FIG. 12 shows the left half of three pairs of rows numbered 1, 2 and 3 and spaced at distances t2 and t3 with reference to the longitudinal centerline.Rows 1 and 3 have no longitudinal displacement and row 2 is longitudinally displaced by a distance equivalent to the hole space a . Each row has a particular set of angles y and 6. Thus, at row 1 the film hole angles Y and 0 are such that planar velocity components Val and V 1 exist and where V1 is the planar resultant inclined at the corres ponding compound angle ssl. 1Similarly, they, 0 values for other rows are implemented so as to obtain the qualitative vector picture shown in FIG. 12. In addition to the angular difference, vectors V1, V2 and V3 are different in magnitude because of the different supply flow rates in corresponding manifolds.Thus, V3 V2 V1 reflect the supply flow rate variation, viz., flow rate 3 flow rate 2 flow rate 1.The underlying reason for the film hole angular variations just described is to give a much improved transverse stability to the moving wafer. When the wafer center of gravity C.G. is moving along the a axis, the transverse velocity components V dominate in producing fluid forces to propel a the wafer. If the C.G. moves in the t direction while the wafer moves down the track, the V a induced fluid forces diminish with deviation distance, t, while Vt increases progressively to provide more effective transverse restoring force. The overall result is a stronger resistance to deviation from motion along the centerline. Furthermore, when this condition does occur, the recovery damping is more rapid.Typical film hole angles for the film hole rows are as follows row 1 y 100, 6 . 200 row 2 y 150, 6 150 row 3 X 200, 6 100. Row spacings can vary somewhat without sensitive influence on wafer motion. For example, typical spacings for both 83 mm 3.25 inch and 57 mm 2.25 inch wafers are as follows tl 22,2 mm 7 8 inch to 25,4 mm linch t2 50,8 mm 2 inches to 52 4 mm 2 1 16 inches t3 73 mm 2 7 8 inch to 76,2 mm 3 inches .Film hole diameters range from 0,34 mm 0.0135 inch to 0,64 mm 0.025 inch and lengths range from 1,65 mm 0.065 inch to 3,05 mm 0.12 inch . A typical track uses 0,34 mm 0.0135 inch diameter film holes for lengths ranging from approximately 1,65 mm 0.065 inch to 1,93 mm 0.076 inch the variation in lengths being due to the different inclination angles y and 8. Referring to FIG. 5, the following typical dimensions are used in the track channel radius R 3,18 mm 0.125 inch distance s 6,35 mm 0.250 inch distance d 3w18 mm 0.125 inch distance w 1,83 mm 0.072 inch . This set of dimensions represents one of a number of other practical conditions. For example, the channel radius R can be varied to augment transverse stability on the track.In other applications such as an orientor, or an intersection, the radius becomes less important because the axial wafer momentum force is absent. Indeed, a radius R 0 is used in some designs.Referring back to FIG. 12, the manifold supply flow rate is set by placing a manometer total pressure tube over passage or film hole 20 and adjusting manifold pressure to give desired manometer readings. Thus, typical stagnation pressures for the film hole rows as measured by the mano meter are as follows row 1 152 to 254 mm 6 to 10 inches water column row 2 381 to 508 mm 15 to 20 inches water column row 3 711 to 864 mm 28 to 34 inches water column.The common reservoir for the manifold has a pressure in the order of O71 to 0,14 bar 1.5 to 2 psig upstream of the three adjustment valves for the film hole rows.Referring now to FIG. 5, air issuing from any one of the array of film holes 20 within the control volume strikes the wafer 12 and undergoes an abrupt change in flow direction. This change in direction results in a flow separation over the track surface which produces the static pressure variation in the radial direction which is shown in FIG. 6.The integrated effect of this variation, over a given surface area around the film hole, is both to attract and repel the wafer 12 by producing both an attracting and repelling force on the wafer. One aspect of the curved exterior wall surface 30 is that it acts to extend the attraction force over a wider region. The repelling force from the film hole acts to repel the wafer 12 from the track 14. This, however, is prevented by the coexisting attraction force and the. weight of the wafer.The net result is that for a given air flow rate, a state of dynamic equilibrium occurs at a certain film thickness t, where the forces balance, in a direction normal to the track surface. The film thickness is characteristically constant and its value, for a given element weight, depends on the air flow rate. Any tendency of the element to tilt relative to the track surface is continuously counteracted.This analysis can be extended to the entire wafer surface bounding the upper side of the control volume. As shown in FIG. 7, the wafer 12 of weight W is subjected to an average force F due to the combined suction effects of the film S holes in the control volume or in other words, the air volume under the wafer. This force acts in the normal direction and is opposed by the sum of normal momentum force components of the film hole flows, namely z n Pn. The dynamic equilibrium condition, at the film thickness h, is thus z P W F . The control volume air. film embodying this n s action of normal forces exerts a continuous, uniform, stabilizing effect on the wafer in the normal direction.Thus, as the wafer moves in the axial direction it does so at an essentially constant film thickness h due to this overall motion constraint. The magnitude of the constant film thickness is, for other conditions fixed, a function of the air flow rate. This variation of h with track flow rate is illustrated in FIG. 8. Since the relationship x Pn W F5 exists for each value of h, the shape of the curve reflects the relative magnitudes of the quantities Pn, W, and F . A variation in the wafer weight W, for example, S is reflected by a shift to a new equilibrium value of h.Up to this point the discussion has been focused on motion constraint properties in a direction normal to the air track and wafer surfaces. In addition to these properties, there coexist motion control forces in directions parallel to the wafer surface. The forces are incorporated into the air film by use of the Coanda effect in conjunction with the axi radial phenomenon.One kind of force in the plane of the wafer is due to the planar components of the momentum repelling force acting on the wafer element. These components are introduced by inclining the film holes i.e., at angles Y and 6 so that planar components normal to, and parallel to, the track longitudinal axis are obtained. Thus, as shown in FIG. 4, this resolution consists of axial and transverse momentum force components on the wafer element, at each film hole site. The second kind of force in the plane of the wafer is due to the boundary layer induced frictional forces associated with the air flow parallel to the wafer surfaces. To illustrate this, a typical velocity profile is shown inFIG. 9. This profile represents the variation of the parallel flow velocity components with normal distance in the air film.In accordance with boundary layer theory, the flow shear force is proportional to the rate of ch ange of this velocity, taken at the wafer surface. Hence, a fluid shear force is produced on the wafer element surface. The magnitude of this force, for other conditions equal, depends on the shape of the velocity profile in the neighborhood of the wafer surface i.e., the greater the velocity rate ofchange, the higher the shear force .. The channel action promotes a profile of the kind illustrated which, in turn, is very effective in the above process.The combined effect of the above two kinds of forces is represented by the resultant planar force vector acting in the Z direction, as shown in Fig. 4. The constituent momentum and shear forces increase as the air flow rate is increased. For a given flow rate, the average velocity of the flow parallel to the wafer surface changes with distance from the film hole. Consequently, this is reflected in a corresponding variation of the shear force acting on the wafer surface. In the present case, the coupled action of the axi radial suction region and the channel produce a unique net effect with regard to the shear force characteristics. First, the flow separation over the suction region results in a high velocity parallel to the wafer surface. Second, the curved surface in pulling a large part of the efflux flow into the channel, enhances the velocity profile shape.Consequently, this coupled action results in a high, essentially constant shear force over the surface region encompassing the film hole and channel. By referring back to FIGS. 7 and 4, the above discussion can be extended to the entire wafer surface bounding the upper side of the control volume, the resultant planar force vector at a film hole is denoted by P, and its axial and transverse components by P and Pt respectively. As shown, a t each film hole row and its channel is opposed by an equal such arrangement located at the same distance and at the opposite side of the symmetry axis. In the illustrated track configuration, there are three pairs of symmetrically opposed film hole row channel arrangements. Their spacing on the axis is essentially uniform with respect to the wafer diameter. The manifold pressure i.e., film hole flow rate is smallest for the innermost film hole rows and largest for the outermost rows.Correspondingly, the sum of the P forces for an innermost film hole row is smaller than that for the outermost row. Now, when the wafer center is on the axis of symmetry, the sum of the Pt forces on one side of the symmetry axis is just balanced by the sum of Pt on the opposite side. Denoting the sum of the Pt forces acting on t one half of the wafer surface by Rt it is seen that A Rt for the above symmetrical case. Now, if the wafer shifts in the transverse direction, an unbalanced situation in Rt results due to two reasons. One, the wafer encounters increasingly higher Pt forces in the transverse direction due to the manifold pressure settings discussed above. Two, more surface area of the wafer is exposed to the film hole effect in the shift direction. Consequently, an unbalanced force A Rt results which acts to return the wafer to the symmetry position.The action of the Rt transverse constraining force is illustrated in FIG. 10. As shown, the wafer moving axially along the track is continuously subjected to the centeringRt force field. Any tendency for the wafer to travel in the transverse direction produces a A Rt force that acts to bring its c.g. on the symmetry axis as it moves in the axial direction. The variation of A Rt with wafer displacement in the transverse direction is sketched in FIG. 11. Once an axially moving wafer is displaced transversely, it is desirable to restore its motion back to the symmetry axis in the shortest possible downstream axial distance. The characteristics of the A Rt field are very effective in accomplishing this action.Referring again to FIG. 10 the sum of the axial force components Pa is denoted by R . This unbalanced force a scheme moves the wafer on the air film along the axis of symmetry while its motion in other directions is constrained as discussed above.The hole pattern construction described above in connection with FIGS. 1, 1A and 12 represents a reduction of approximately 50 in holes per unit track length L as compared to the construction of U.S. Patent No. 4 081 201 to Hassan et al.This pattern is structured in a way such that two different sizes of wafers can be accommodated by the same track. For example, wafers of 57 and 83 mm 2.25and 3.25 inches in diameter can be transported on the track at the same supply air flow conditions. For a track design in which only a single size wafer is to be transported, even further constructional simplification can be achieved in the hole pattern. One such construction is illustrated in FIG. 13 which shows a track segment of length L embodying a symmetrical arrangement of transverse pairs of rows of holes.The holes in each row are spaced apart by a distance llxl which is the same for each pair of rows. The holes in adjacent rows are longitudinally displaced by a distance y , which is the same for each adjacent row. That is the longitudinal displacement between row 3 and row 2 y3 2 is the same as y2 1 and yl 3. In contrast to the pattern ofFIG. ia, each column contains only two holes and consequent ly this structure represents a reduction of approximately 67 in holes per unit track length L, relative to that of the aforementioned patent.The above track constructions embodying a greatly reduced number of air film holes are thus more economical to produce. Because of the reduced number of holes, the air supply requirements for a track installation are substantially decreased. Furthermore, because of the particular hole patterns and hole angle relationships, coupled with a marked decrease in cross interference flow action between holes a greatly improved wafer stability and motion control capability is achieved. Thus, the overall multiple hole structure represents a particularly advantageous arrangement where the desired axi radial and Coanda flow effects are maximized while the dissipative and necessary cross interference flow effects are minimized.The above air film embodies unique characteristics of concurrently acting normal direction and planar forces acting on a moving wafer. It is thus capable of exerting multidirectional constraint on a wafer moving in a prescribed manner. For linear wafer motionr the force field constrains its transverse and normal direction motions in a stable manner. For rotational motion, in a particular variation of the film surface shown in FIG. 1, the force field acts radially and normally to provide precise, stable rotation with respect to the symmetry axes of the surface.The generic air film surface can take different forms depending on the application and or emphasis on certain control properties e.g., air tracks, intersections, orientors . By this basic configuration, a unique air film is generated having multidirectional wafer motion control properties. This film surface, based on a synthesis of two fluid mechanics phenomena, can take various forms depending on the application.The key feature of its operation resides in the effective coupling of the axi radial and Coanda flow characteristics.The fundamental surface construction feature by which this is accomplished is illustrated, in essence, by flat surface regions containing long, thin air film holes interrupted by channels having a certain cross sectional shape. Among the important geometric quantities are included the film hole diameter, length, and inclination the extent of the flat surfaces containing the film holes the dimensions of the channel cross section and, the spacing arrangements of the film hole rows and channels with respect of the wafer surface. Some of the fluid mechancis parameters include air flow rate supply and distribution to various film hole regions.
