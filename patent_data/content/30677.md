# Apparatus for receiving a stack of film sheets and dispensing one film sheet at a time.

## Abstract
An apparatus for receiving a stack of film sheets 16 and dispensing one film sheet at a time comprises a housing wherein each film sheet extends in a largely vertical plane and a roller 124 at the lower end of the housing 22 . Means 122 spaced slightly from the roller 124 normally allow only one film sheet at a time to pass by that roller 124 . A backing device 114 is disposed in the housing 22 with a lower end thereof on a side of the region opposite the roller 124 and is urged to move so its lower end moves towards the roller 124 to push a film sheet 16 against the roller 124 . The apparatus makes it possible to dispense a film sheet into an exposure apparatus under day light conditions.

## Description
Apparatus for receiving a stack of film sheets and dispensing one film sheet at a timeThe invention relates to an apparatus for receiving a stack of film sheets and dispensing one film sheet at a time. The apparatus comprises a housing wherein the stack of film sheets is hold in a largely vertical plane.The invention as claimed solves the problem of how to design an apparatus for receiving a stack of film sheets and dispensing one film sheet at a time, said apparatus making it possible to dispense one film sheet into a radiophotographic unit under daylight conditions. A suitable radiophotographic unit is claimed in European patent application 78 100 141.7.One way of carring out the inveniton is described in detail below with reference to the drawings which illustrate one specific embodiment, in which Figure 1 is a partial perspective view of a radiophotographic unit shown with a portion of the lighttight housing cut away Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of the dispenser portion of the unit of Figure 1, showing a film magazine outside of the receiver Figure 3 is an exploded perspective view of the film magazine of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a view taken on the line 4 4 of Figure 2 Figure 5 is a view taken on the line 5 5 of Figure 4 Figure 6 is a partial view of the dispenser portion of Figure 4, showing it in a condition wherein a film is almost completely dispensed from the apparatus Figure 7 is a view taken on the line 7 7 of Figure 4 Figure 8 is a view taken on the line 8 8 of Figure 7 Figure 9 is a view taken on the line 9 9 of Figure 2 Figure 10 is a view taken on the line 10 10 of Figure 9.Fig. 1 illustrates a chest X ray unit 10 which includes a main frame 12, an exposure apparatus 14 mounted along the frame for holding a sheet of film 16, a dispenser 18 above the exposure apparatus for dispensing the film into the exposure apparatus, and an exposed film receiver 20 located below the exposure apparatus for receiving the exposed film. The unit is prepared for operation by first loading a bulk film magazine 22 into a magazine holding portion 24 of the dispenser.Then, a handle 26 on the main frame is pivoted to an upward position 26u to tip back a mounting frame 28 of the exposure apparatus 14 to a position for receiving a film from the dispenser, and a control on panel 30 is operated to cause the dispensing of a film into the exposure apparatus After the film has. been received,. the handle 26 is moved into a downward position ZbG wnicn causes the riim ib to oe neia in the exposure apparatus closely against intensifier screens A patient then can be positioned in front of a cover 27 on the exposure apparatus 14 and an exposure made. Finally, the handle is moved up to its central position 26 and the film 16 drops down into the receiver 20.The exposure apparatus 14 is described in detail inEuropean patent application 78 100 141.7.Figs. 2 8 illustrate the film dispenser 18 which dispenses one film. at a time. into the exposure apparatus. As shown in Fig. 2, the holding portion 24 of the dispenser has a cover 100 that can be swung open to receive the film holding magazine 22.The film magazine 22 has a lid 102 at the top that can be opened to receive a stack of film sheets in a darkroom and which then can be closed to make the magazine lighttight. As the magazine 22 is installed in the holding portion 24, it encounters a pair of pins 104 that open a light seal at the bottom and a receptacle 106 that receives a matting plug on the magazine. Fig. 4 illustrates the light seal 108 at the bottom of the magazine 22, and shows the pair of rods 110 that are attached to the light seal. Fig. 6 illustrates the magazine 22 installed in the holder portion 24 of the dispenser, showing how the pins 104 on the holder depress the rods 110 to slide the light seal 108 against biasing of springs 112 so that a film sheet 16 can pass down through the dispenser.As illustrated in Fig. 4, the magazine 22 includes a vertical pusher plate 114 whose upper end carries a pair of guides li6 hatCdii move furwardly along downwardly inclined guideways 118 in a pair of guide plates 120. The pusher plate 114 is therefore urged by gravity to move forward, to push a stack of film 16s forwardly and down along an inclined support plate 122. As the film moves forward and down the support plate 122, the film nearest the roller film is caught between a dispenser roller 124 and blocks 126 at the bottom of the pusher plate. The blocks 126, which are especially useful for pushing the last films of the stack into the roller, are constructed of low friction material such as a Delrin acetal resin.The low. friction material of the blocks 126 aids them in sliding down along a lower support plate 127 and in assuring that when theblocks push the last film against the drive roller 124 the blocks do not retard the film from moving down.The forward edge 122e of the upper support plate 122 is accurately spaced from the drive roller 124 to form a throat 129 between them that permits only one sheet to pass down through the throat. Thus, for film sheets of 0.254 mm thickness, the edge 122e may be spaced a distance such as 0.305 mm from the roller. Also the edge 122e may be formed of a low friction material such as a Teflon fluorocarbon resin to facilitate the passage of film thereby. The magazine is normally loaded with film in a darkroom by laying the holding portion horizontally and then laying a stack of film on the pusher plate 114. When the holding portion is turned to the vertical as shown in Fig. 4, or is moved around, it is possible for more than one sgeet to be pushed into space above the support plate edge 122e and the roller 124. In order to avoid jamming of film, a backup member 128 is provided which can push the stack of film rearwardly, to push back sheets which have started to gather in and above throat space 129 and the roller. The backup member 128 is pivotally mounted at 130 and has a button 132 protruding from the film holder housing to enable a technician to press the button after he has loaded the magazine 22 in magazine 24. The backup member is also useful in that when its end 128e pushes back the stack and quickly releases it, the member bends the sheets and shakes up the stack. Any film sheets which have not fallen down firmly into the support plate 122 will do so, and the film sheets will lie in a more uniform arrangement for reliable dispensing.When the film magazine 22 has been installed in the holding portion 24 of dispenser 18, a drive pin 134 Fig. 9 at the end of the drive roller 124 lies in the path of a drive tab 136 which lies on a motor driven wheel. When a proper button on the control panel 30 of the unit is depressed, the roller 124 is rotated, as indicated in Fig. 4, to move down one film sheet past a microswitch 138, the thin arm of the microswitch deflecting out of the way of the film. The film then passes through a guideway 140 and through the gut3away 86 into the exposure apparatus 14. Microswitch 138 is connected to a power source and to control panel 30 through receptacle 106. The combination of the support plate edge 122e which is acculately spaced from the roller 124, the pusher plate 114 which holds the film upright and gently pushes it against the roller, and the backup member 128 which can push back and slightly bend the stack to help avoid sticking of the sheets to one another, all combine to assure regularity and evenness in the stack and therefore reliable feeding of only one sheet at a time past the roller. If a sheet is not fed, which is sensed by lack of operation of the microswitch 138, the technician can back up and slightly bend the stack once or twice, and again operate the roller to dispense a film sheet. Thus, by assuring that the sheets are well positioned in the magazine, uniform dispensing of the sheets is achieved.
