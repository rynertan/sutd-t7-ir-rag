## Description
The present invention is directed to advanced epoxy resin compositions which when formulated into a can coating result in a coating which has good wet adhesion as well as good dry adhesion and a method for preparing these resins. Can coatings have heretofore been formulated from advanced epoxy resins. These coatings usually have good dry adhesion, but relatively poor wet adhesion. It is desirable that such coatings have both good wet and dry adhesion, particularly for food and beverage cans. It has been discovered that when the advanced epoxy resin employed in the coating formulation has an epoxide equivalent weight of from 3,000 to 3,900 and a weight average molecular weight of from 13,000 to 17,000 the resultant coating has good wet adhesion as well as good dry adhesion. The present invention concerns advanced epoxy resins prepared from a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A having an epoxide equivalent weight of from 170 to 195 and bisphenol A wherein the resultant advanced epoxy resin has an epoxide equivalent weight of from 3,000 to 3,900 and a weight average molecular weight of from 13,000 to 17,000. Another aspect of the present invention pertains to a process for preparing an epoxy resin having an epoxide equivalent weight of from 3,000 to 3,900 and a weight average molecular weight of from 13,000 to 17,000 which process comprises Suitable solvents which can be employed in step I of the process of the present invention as component D and in step III of the process of the present invention as component E include, for example, glycol ethers, alcohols, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof. Particularly suitable solvents which can be employed in step I and step III of the process of the present invention as components D and component E include, for example, 2 butoxyethanol n butyl ether of ethylene glycol , aromatic solvents having a flash point of 43 C and a boiling range of 155 C to 173 C, aromatic solvents having a flash point of 66 C and a boiling range of 183 C to 210 C, methyl amyl ketone, diacetone alcohol, methyl ether of dipropylene glycol, 3 methyl 3 methoxy butanol, xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetone, n butanol, sec butanol, isopropanol, butyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. Particularly suitable solvents which can be employed in step I of the process of the present invention as component D include 2 butoxyethanol, xylene, aromatic hydrocarbon solvent, 3 methyl 3 methoxy butanol, methyl ether of dipropylene glycol or a mixture thereof. Particularly suitable solvents which can be employed in step III of the process of the present invention as component E include 2 butoxyethanol, xylene, aromatic hydrocarbon solvent, cyclohexanone, n butanol, or a mixture thereof. The catalysts which can be employed herein as component C are phosphonium compounds such as, for example, phosphonium carboxylates, phosphonium carboxylate carboxylic acid complexes, phosphonium halides, phosphonium biscarbonates, phosphonium phosphates, and mixtures thereof. Particularly suitable phosphonium compounds include, for example, ethyltriphenylphosphonium acetate acetic acid complex, ethyltriphenylphosphonium phosphate, and mixtures thereof. The advanced epoxy resins of the present invention are particularly useful in can coating formulations wherein such formulations contain said advanced epoxy resin, suitable solvents and suitable curing agents and optionally fillers, pigments, flow control agents, surfactants and the like. Suitable curing agents which can be employed in the formulation of can coatings include, for example, phenol aldehyde resole resins, urea aldehyde resins, melamine aldehyde resins, polyamides, acid anhydrides, primary ,secondary and tertiary amines, imidazoles, guanadines, mixtures thereof and the like. The following examples are illustrative of the present invention. In the following examples, the epoxide equivalent weight was determined by titration with perchloric acid. The weight average molecular weight was determined by gel permeation chromatography using polystyrene standards. Coatings were tested for wet and dry adhesion using the T peel test ASTM D1876. The wet adhesion test was performed after the test panels had been immersed in 90 C water for four days 345,600 s . To a one liter 5 necked round bottom glass reaction vessel equipped with a means for stirring and temperature control was added 315 g 1.67 equiv. of a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A having an epoxide equivalent weight EEW of 188, 13.13 g of xylene, 1.05 g of ethyltriphenylphosphonium phosphate 30 percent solids in methanol , 172.3 g 1.51 equiv. of bisphenol A and 39.56 g of the n butyl ether of ethylene glycol. The contents were heated with stirring to a temperature of 160 C over a period of 62 minutes 3720 s . The contents were then allowed to exotherm to a temperature of 206 C after which the contents were cooled to a temperature of 171 C and maintained at a temperature of 170 C for a period of 90 minutes 5400 s . A sample was taken and an analysis revealed it to have an EEW of 3,362 and a weight average molecular weight of 14,457. The resultant product was then quenched to a 40 percent by weight non volatiles level with 678.3 g of a 60 40 mixture, by weight, of xylene and the n butyl ether of ethylene glycol, respectively. A coating was prepared by mixing the following components The above mixture was heated for 4 hours 14,400 s at a temperature of 110 C. After cooling to ambient temperature, the resultant coating composition was coated onto tin free steel panels and cured in an oven at 210 C for 0.22 hour 780 s .
