# Video signal recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A video signal recording and reproducing apparatus comprises a bimorph leaf 2 for controlling the position of a rotary magnetic head 1 in the traverse diredction of a skew track formed on a tape, a tracking circuit 3 which detects a relative displacement between the track and the head 1 , and supplies a tracking signal to the bimorph leaf 2 , a circuit 5 for sampling the tracking signal at a plurality of sampling points located in the longitudinal direction of the track, a memory group M1 to M32 corresponding to the sampling points, and a circuit 8, 11 which compares stored values in the memory group M1 to M32 with current sample values, and corrects the stored values using a variation factor determined in accordance with the result of the comparison, the bimorph leaf 2 being controlled after an editing joint on the basis of sample values of average tracking signals for a plurality of tracks whih have been stored in the memory group M1 to M32 during tape editing.
