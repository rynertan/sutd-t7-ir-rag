## Description
PJIINE RESIN SUPPORTED RHODIUM COBALT BJrETS.LLIC CLUSTERS AS NOVEL HYDROFORMYLATION CATALYSTS This invention relates to multinuclear metal catalysts. In one aspect, the invention relates to said catalysts supported by an amine resin In other aspects, the invention relates to a method of preparing and to various methods of employing these supported catalysts. The art recognized method I of preparing alcohols from olefins is a two step oxo, or hTdrofor mylation, process EMI1.1 The first step comprises contacting at elevated temperature and pressure, e.g., 125 C 175 C and about 3000 50C0 psi 212 353 kg cm2 , an olefin vith synthesis gas a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the presence of an oxo catalyst to produce a mixture of aldehydes. These aldehydes are then hydrogenated typically in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst in a second step to their corresponding alcohols. Cobalt and rhodium are frequently used as the oxo catalysts. Reported efforts to convert this two step process to a highly selective one step process have been singularly unsuccessful. Slaugh et al., J. Organometal. Chem., 13, 469 1968 , teach that a catalyst comprising cobalt carbonyl and a modifying ligand of tributyl phosphine affords a one step, oxo synthesis of alcohols but accompanying olefin hydrogenation reduces yields 77 percent alcohol . Jurewicz et al., Adv. Chem. Ser., 132, 240 51 1974 and Rollmann et al., Ger. 2,357,645, teach, respectively, that rhodium carbonyl supported on an amine resin or in the presence of tertiary amines also catalyzes a one step oxo synthesis of alcohols. However, both research teams report suppressed yields about 28 percent alcohol . The defects of the prior art have been substantially overcome by the present invention, which is a catalyst comprising a rhodium cobalt carbonyl bimetallic cluster supported on an amine resin. The present invention is also directed to a method for preparing the rhodium cobalt carbonyl catalyst. The present invention also includes a one step oxo process for converting olefins to alcohols, the process comprising reacting the olefin with a gaseous mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at a temperature of at least 500C and a pressure of at least 500 psi 35.3 kg cm2 in the presence of a catalytic amount of a catalyst consisting of a rhodium cobalt bimetallic cluster supported on an amine resin. These catalysts are both easily prepared by reacting the bimetallic cluster with an amine resin in an inert liquid medium and exhibit long life. Also, these catalysts are highly selective in that alcohols are produced in essentially quantitative yield and permit the oxo process to be conducted at less rigorous process conditions. The supported catalysts here used are prepared by loading onto an amine resin a bimetallic cluster of the formula RhxCoy12 11 wherein x and y are each integers of 1 3 and x y 4.These bimetallic clusters are tetranuclear carbons and are readily synthesized by any number of varying methods.For example, tetranuclear carbonyl Rh2Co2 CO 12 can b prepared by either of the following methods III, IV EMI3.1 tb Zn Co CO 4 2 SEP SEP Rh2 CO 4C12 SEP mM ene SEP Rh2Co2 CO 12 SEP SEP ZnC12 tb SEP III tb SEP H SEP O tb SEP 2 Rh C0 2C12 SEP SEP 2tCo C0 4 SEP 2 SEP yRh2Co2 co l2 SEP SEP 4Cl tb SEP IV tb These and other methods for preparing the bimetallic clusters of this invention are further described by Martinengo et al., J. Orqanometal. Chem., 59, 379 1973 .Conventional methods for preparing the monometallic carbonyls, e.g., ZntCo CO 4 2, etc., are described by King,Organometallic Synthesis, 1, 98 101 1965 . Clusters wherein x and y are each 2 are preferred. Any amine resin that can be loaded with the bimetallic cluster II can be used in the practice of this invention. These resins are typically cross linked and essentially water insoluble, and they can possess primary, secondary and or tertiary integral and or pendant amine functionality. By integral amine function ality is meant that the amine functionality, i.e., amino group, is incorporated directly into the resin matrix.Examples of such resins include Polyethylenepolyamine cross linked with epichlorohydrin, urea formaldehyde cross linked copolymers and melamine formaldehyde cross linked copolszzers. By pendant amine functionality is meant that the amine functionality is suspended from the resin matrix backbone . This resin backbone can be essentially any cross linked composition, such as styrene divinylbenne, styrene glycoldimethacrylate, aniline formaldehyde, aryl polyamine formaldehyde, phenol formaldehyde, or polyacrylate. The pendant amine functionality can include such diverse functionality as primary, secondary and tertiary amines, di , tri and polyamines and hydrolyzed oxazolines. The preferred resins are weak base anion exchange resins. The amine resins of this invention can take many forms, but swellable gel or macroporous beads are the most common and are thus preferred. Resins having pendant amine functionality are preferred to resins having integral amine functionality and resins having an exchange capacity of at least about 3 milliequivalents per gram of dry resin are particularly preferred. These latter resins include resins comprising a cross linked polymer matrix having pendant amine functionality of the formulae N R 2 andjor NHR N R 2 wherein each R is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl,R is C2 C6 al lene, and the open valence is the bond that joins the functionality to the polymer matrix.Typical substituents include R alkyls, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, etc. and R alkylenes, such as ethylene, propylene, hexylene, etc. The radical represents various diamines and alkyl substituted diamines such as NHRlN R 2 R N R 2 ethylenediamine CH2CH2 NH2 propylenediamine CH2CH2CE2 NH2 hexylenediamine CH2 CH2 4CH2 NH2N methylethylene di amine CH2CH2 NHCH3N,N dimethyl ethylenediamine CH2CH2 N CH3 2 N, N ethylmethyl ethylenediamine CR2CR2 N CH3 CH2CH3 The amine functionality of these preferred resins can be either primary, secondary and or tertiary although primary functionality is preferred when the amine is of the formula NHR N R 2 and secondary and tertiary functionality is preferred when the amine is of the formula N R 2. N R 2 functionality is preferred to NHR N R 2 functionality. An especially preferred, commercial amine resin is a macroporous, cross linked polystyrene polymer matrix having pendant amine functionality of the formula N R 2 wherein each R is methyl. The catalyst of this invention is prepared by loading the bimetallic cluster onto the amine resin. This loading is accomplished by a method comprising reacting in an inert liquid medium the bimetallic cluster with the amine resin. Tically, the reaction is conducted at a cluster amine on resin mole ratio i.e., cluster resin mole equivalents ratio of at least about 1 100 and preferably at least about 1 25. The maximum cluster resin mole ratio equivalents ratio can be varied as desired but is typically about 1 1 and preferably about 1 4. By inert liquid is meant one that is non reactive with the materials used, under the conditions employed. The inert liquid comprises one or more liquid solvent s in which the bimetallic cluster is soluble and which is inert non reactive with both the reagents and products. Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and substituted hydrocarbons are illustrative solvents and include such compounds as hexane, benzene, toluene, o , m and p xylenes, o dichlorobenzene, methylene chloride, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. Benzene and the alkyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbons having up to 3 substituent alkyl groups having not more than 2 carbon atoms in each alkyl group are preferred, with benzene and toluene especially preferred. This method can be practiced at any temperature and pressure at which the reaction mixture of birnetallic cluster and solubilizing inert liquid are liquid.It is most convenient to use ambient temperature and pressure, e.g., 200C 300C and atmospheric pressure. The reaction is typically conducted under an inert atmosphere, such as argon, and for a sufficient period of time to load the bimetallic cluster onto the resin. This period of time will vary with the reagents and conditions employed, but with many reayents and at ambient conditions the loading is partially achieved after about 2 hours, and is generally complete after about 12 hours. The resulting catalyst is recovered by any convenient physical separation technique, e.g., filtering. The physical and chemical structure of the catalyst, i.e., the bimetallic cluster loaded supported upon the amine resin, is not fully known. However, it is known that the catalyst contains rhodium and cobalt car bonyl attached to the amine resin. Typically, the catalyst comprises, as determined by any conventional elemental analysis method, at least about 1 weight percent and preferably at least about 4 weight percent, rhodium metal basis and at least about 0.5 weight percent, and preferably at least about 2.5 weight percent, cobalt metal basis . Resin saturation is the only limitation upon the maximum weight percent of rhodium and cobalt and the saturation levels are preferred for reasons of catalytic activity and life. Saturation levels vary dependent upon the particular amine resin and bimetallic cluster employed. These new catalysts are used in substantially the same manner as known catalysts. This invention s oxo process of converting olefins directly to alcohols requires a catalytic amount of catalyst. Typically, the minimum amount of catalyst Rh Co metal basis present is about 0.1 weight percent, and preferably about 0.25 weight percent, based on the weight of olefin. Practical considerations such as economy and convenience are the only limitations upon the maximum amount of catalyst that can be present, although preferably a maximum amount of about 5 weight percent, and most preferably of about 2 weight percent is used. Conventional oxo process reaction times are employed. While these catalysts are operable under typical oxo temperatures and pressures, i.e., about 1250C 1750C and 3000 5000 psi 212 353 kg cm2 , they are also operable at much lower temperatures and or pressures. Accordingly, in the presence of the catalysts here used, olefins are directly converted to alcohols at conditions of at least about 50 C and at least about 500 psi 35.3 kg cm2 . However, in most instances best results are achieved at conditions of at least about 100 C and 750 psi 53 kg cm2 and thus these conditions are preferred. Any olefin that can be converted to an aldehyde by the known oxo process can be converted to an alcohol by this invention s oxo process. Illustrative oxo olefins include Ethylene, propylene, 1 butene, 2 butene, l pentene, l hexene, l decene, 3 methyl l butene, butadiene, 1,4 pentadiene, isoprene, cyclohexene, cycloheptene, dicyclopentadiene, norborene, allyl alcohol and allyl acetate. Suitable combinations of different olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, can also be used. Any conventional gaseous mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be here used although amounts in excess of stoichiometric hydroformylation process requirements are preferred. Typically, the hydrogen carbon monoxide H2 CO mole ratio here used varies from 1 10 to 10 1, preferably about 1 1. The catalysts and hydroformylation process described herein are especially adaptable to preparing dimethanoldicyclopentadiene from dicyclopentadiene DCPD .The term dicyclcpentadlene DCPD as used herein Includes both crude and purified DCPD. Crude DCPD is a hydrocarbon stream, such as that taken from a naphtha or LPG cracker, containing at least about 50 percent and normally not more than about 95 weight percent DCPD. It is to be understood that the catalysts and hydrofonnylation process described herein are applicable to DCPD, whether it be the normal crude or the purified material. The following examples illustrate this invention. Unless indicated otherwise all parts and percentages are by weight.Example 1 a Catalyst Preparation Beads 0.25 g of an amine resin having a cross linked polystyrene backbone and pendant benzyl dimethylamine functionality, a bimetallic cluster of the formulaRh2Co2 CO 12 0.2 g and toluene 20 ml were mixed and agitated under argon at ambient conditions for 12 hours.The thus modified beads catalyst were then filtered and dried under vacuum. The catalyst had a gray black color when wet with toluene and a grayish color when dry. Elemental analysis showed the catalyst to contain 4 weight percent rhodium and 2.6 weight percent cobalt, and an infrared spectrum exhibited several overlapping strong absorptions at about 1890 cm 1, a strong absorption at l l about 2000 cm l and a medium absorption at about 2010 cm in the carbonyl stretching frequency region. Example l b The catalyst 0.2 g thus prepared was charged to a pressure reactor with dry, deaerated benzene 3 ml under argon. 1 Hexene 1 ml was then added and the reactor contents subsequently flushed with nitrogen and pressured with equimolar amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The reactor was heated to 1000C, with a pressure of 750 psi 53 kg cm2 , and held thereat for 2 hours. The reactor was then allowed to cool and the contents analyzed by both gas chromatography GC and nuclear magnetic resonance NMR . The reaction product contained 96.3 percent alcohol.Control A A catalyst was prepared according to th above procedure except that Rh4 CO 12 was substituted for the bimetallic cluster and the catalyst comprised 9.2 percentRh rather than 6.6 percent Rh Co. Example l b was then repeated except that the catalyst thus prepared was substituted for the catalyst prepared in Example l a and a pressure of 1,000 psi 71 kg cm2 was substituted for 750 psi 53 kg cm2 . GC analysis of the reaction product showed aldehydes present to the extent of 21 percent and alcohols present to the extent of only 54.4 percent. Control B A catalyst was prepared according to the procedure of Example l a except that Co4 CO 12 was substituted for the bimetallic cluster and the catalyst comprised 3 percent Co rather than 6.6 percent Rh Co. Example l b was then repeated except that the catalyst thus prepared was substituted for the catalyst prepared in Example l a and a pressure of 1,000 psi 71 kg cm2 was substituted for 75Q psi 53 kg cmê . GC analysis of the reaction product showed aldehydes present to the extent of 71.1 percent with onl 1.2 percent alcohol present. The results of Controls A and B demonstrate the marked difference between supported Rh and Co monometallic clusters and supported Rh Co bimetallic clusters.Control C A catalyst was prepared according to the procedure of Example 1 a except that Rh6 CO 16 and Co2 CO 8 at a 1 1 metal ratio were substituted for the bimetallic cluster. Example l b was then repeated except that the catalyst thus prepared was substituted for the catalyst prepared in Example l a , a pressure of 1,000 psi 71 kg cm2 was substituted for 750 psi 53 kg cm2 , and a residence time of 3 hours was substituted for 2 hours.GC analysis of the reaction product showed aldehydes present to the extent of 83 percent. This demonstrates the great contrast between a catalyst prepared from anRh Co bimetallic cluster and a catalyst prepared from individual Rh and Co carbonyls. Control D Following a procedure similar to Example l b , l hexene 1 ml was charged to a reactor containing dry deaerated benzene 3 ml and a mixture of benzyl dimethylamine and Rh2Co2 CO 12. The mixture comprised about 6.5 weight percent metal as did the catalyst of Example l b . The reactor contents were then flushed with nitrogen and pressured with equimolar amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen and heated to 1000C, the pressure reaching 1,000 psi 71 kg cmê . The reactor contents were held thereat for 3 hours, allowed to cool and subsequently analyzed.The reaction product contained 71.9 percent aldehydes, 12.1 percent alcohols and the remainder was a mixture of isomerization products. This demonstrates the marked difference between an Rh Co bimetallic cluster supported by an amine resin and an Rh Co bimetallic cluster merely in the presence of amine functionality.Examples 2 4 Control D was repeated except the catalyst ofExample l a was substituted for the catalyst of Control D and various olefins were substituted for 1 hexene. The results are tabulated below.
