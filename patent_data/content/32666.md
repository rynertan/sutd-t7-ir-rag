# Circuit interrupter trip unit.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a circuit interrupter including magnetically operable trip means for tripping the circuit interrupter open in response to overcurrents exceeding a predetermined value. The trip means in each pole of the interrupter includes a trip bar actuating lever 105 of unitary construction, a magnetic armature 113 disposed on the lever, and a magnetizable core 119 which cooperates with the armature to form a predetermined air gap 135 when the unitary lever is in a non actuated position, and which core is disposed to be energized by said overcurrents, thereby to attract the armature and effect a trip bar actuating movement of the lever, the arrangement being such that the air gap defining surfaces of the armature and core are, and throughout movement of the lever remain, substantially parallel with respect to each other. The novel arrangement permits precise calibration and adjustment over a wider range of trip currents and provides a predictably accurate response.
