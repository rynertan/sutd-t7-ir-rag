# Wash arm and method and apparatus for forming the same.

## Abstract
A method of forming spray nozzles along a fluid conduit includes forming a row of holes 76,78 along a length of tubing 10 , and then countersinking the holes. Portions 72, 74 of the tubing are then depressed inwardly, one around each hole, along an imaginary line 14 along the tubing outer surface that is parallel to the central tube axis and that passes over the holes. An apparatus for carrying out the method is also disclosed.
