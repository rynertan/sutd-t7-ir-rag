# Incinerator for chemical waste material stored in barrels.

## Abstract
Incinerator having a primary and a secondary combus tion chamber, the primary combustion chamber has a bottom section 2 and a top section 3 , both provided with burners and air injection means 22, 38, 39, 40 . The wall of the top section 3 has a sluice port 4 for introducing a barrel 8 , and within the top section there is provided a barrel holder 14 for receiving and holding such a barrel. The barrel holder 14 is mounted for rotation about a horizontal axis and can be operated for turning the barrel from upright to fully or partly inverted position and vice versa. Burning of the waste may take place either in the barrel in upright position, or upon turning of the barrel and dropping of its content into the bottom section 2 , or a combination of both. Thereby optimum conditions may be created for incineration of waste of varying consistency, ranging from liquid to solid, and no manual handling of barrels or their contents is required. A maximum of automatization and economy can be obtained by providing, in the top section, a downwardly directed, vertical ly displaceable burner 22 combined with a consistency sensor 37 assisting in governing displacement of the burner 22 and turning of the barrel holder 14 .
