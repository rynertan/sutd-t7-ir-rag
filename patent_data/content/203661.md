## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the removal of acidic gases such as hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide from mixtures of gases containing them, particularly suitable to the use for the treatment of gas mixtures with even very high concentrations of acidic gases. The processes of the prior art for the solution of such problem are technically suitable to handle gases which in their raw state contain relatively low percent ages of acidic gases. They suffer indeed from the fact of having been developed in a situation in which energy was relatively cheap and only natural gases having low contents of such components were hence exploited. Such processes of the prior art can be used also for the processing of gases containing high concentrations of acidic components, but with unacceptable consequences of financial, and to the limit, of also technical character. Such processes are in fact essentially based on the absorption with selective solvents, which retain the acidic components, thus leaving the gas purified. The cost of such treatment results thus proportion al, with good approximation, to the amount of solvent which is used relatively to the amount of gas to be processes. Such an amount of solvent is an increasing function of the content in acidic components. The treatment cost must then be attibuted to the purified gas. It is hence clear that the treatments according to the prior art have unacceptably increasing costs with increasing contents of acidic gases. In the present energetic situation, it is necessary to be able to exploit to the best the resources availa ble. To start up the production of gas fields with gases having a high content of acidic gases, or to the purpose of purifying the synthesis gases produced by starting from fuel oil or from coal, therefore the need presently exists of having available treatment processes suitable to handle gases with high and very high contents of acidic components, able to yield products with even very strict specification. The treatment of such gases requires the adoption of mixed cryogenic and solvent using technologies, so as to combine the advantages of both technologies, a good puri fication of the gases with acceptable costs being obtain ed. The same Applicant has already claimed a process of such a type by the British Patent Nr. 1.555.068 granted on January 9, 1980 in such patent, the purification is reported of a raw gas containing more than 70 of acidic gases, by the combined use of a low temperature distillation, and of absorption by solvent. The solvents described are dimethylether polyethyl eneglycol and propylene carbonate. Always the same Applicant has disclosed in the British Patent Applications No. 84OOO59 and No. 8400060 both filed on January 4, 1984, a process wherein the regenerated solvent is mixed with the gas outcoming from the absorber tower and is cooled in a heat exchanger before being fed to the absorb er tower. It has been found now a new purification cryogenic process particularly suitable to the treatment of gases containing high contents of acidic gases, by means of which the circulation of solvent is considerably reduced. The process being the object of the present inven tion, which comprises essentially an absorption in one or more absorber towers in order to reduce the content of acidic gases, a cooling carried out, in the case of one single absorber tower, upstream the same tower or, in case of two absorber towers, between the same towers a regeneration of the solvent or of the solvents used in the absorption, is characterized in that the gas out coming from one or more of the absorber towers is mixed once or more times with the solvent or solvents, the mixtures thus formed being then cooled, the solvent or solvents being thus separated from the same gas. The solvents of the process according to the inven tion are substantially low molecular weight alcohols, esters and ethers belonging to the following classes Esters of alcohols of general formula R₁COOR₂, wherein R₁ and R₂ are alkyl groups of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, equal to or different from each other, wherein one or more hydrogen atoms can be substituted by alcoholic groups, such as methyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, monoethyleneglycol acetate. esters of glycols of general formula The above reported solvents have a combination of several properties particularly favourable for their use as selective solvents. They have indeed a high stability under the use conditions, high solvent power for the acidic gases, high selectivity for H₂S and CO₂ relatively to hydrocarbons, low molecular weight and low melting point. This last characteristic is essential for the application in a cryogenic process. In the case of the processing of natural gas, after the condensation at low temperature and before the end absorption by solvent, the gas is available at low tempe ratures, considerably lower than 0 C. During the end absorption,it is useful to be able to reach temperatures considerably lower than the gas temperature, which are very favourable, because in this way the absorption power of the solvent and its selec tivity increase. The solvents of the process according to the invention show low melting point and are hence parti cularly suitable for use in a cryogenic process. The solvents according to the invention can be used alone or mixed with each other, or to them water and or an organic compound having low melting point and or low viscosity and or low molecular weight, such as dimethyl ether, methanol, acetone, toluene, ethanol, propane, butane, pentane can be added, to the purpose of adjusting their solvent characteristics as a function of the gas to be treated and of its pressure and temperature condi tions. The organic compound can be added in proportions comprised within the range of fron 0.3 to 40 by weight relatively to the weight of the resulting mixture, and water can be added up to a maximum of 10 by weight. Going back to the process, the mixings between the gas outcoming from the absorber tower or towers and the solvent or solvents are preferably carried out in a mixer by feeding said streams in countercurrent to each other. Said mixings are, for each gas outcoming from an absorber tower, as previously said, in a number higher than 1, and are preferably in a number of two. In case the gas, or each gas outcoming from one absorber tower undergoes two mixings, such mixings can be carried out in the following way first, a mixing of the gas being treated with the regenerated solvent or sol vents takes place, and then to said mixing a cooling and a separation follows of the mixture obtained, thus from the gas the solvent or solvents being separated, which solvent os solvents is are in its their turn mixed in a second mixing step with the gas leaving the absorber tower. To said second mixing step a cooling and a separa tion follows of the mixture obtained in said second mixing, from the gas, which is fed to the first mixing, the solvent or solvents, which is are fed to the absorber tower, being separated. The two coolings following the two mixings can be carried out at the same temperature or at different temperatures, preferably within a temperature range be tween 30 and 100 C, and more preferably between 40 and 80 C. The cooling of the natural gas or synthesis gas can take place in a heat exchanger by vapourizing a portion of the acidic gases contained in the CO₂ rich solvent in a suitable point of the regeneration. The cooling of the gas can also take place inside the absorber tower. The solvent or solvents used for the absorption of the acidic gases in the absorber tower can be regenerated first by means of one or more expansion steps at maxi mum, three of such steps from which above all the valua ble components co absorbed in the first absorber tower, or in the single absorber tower, are recovered, then by means of one or more further expansion steps at maximum, four of such steps , from which mainly the acidic gases evolve. The solvents thus regenerated are recycled to the absorber tower or absorber towers after being mixed with the gas as described above. The regeneration of the mixture must be completed by a distillation tower if in the acidic gases also H₂S is contained, because the specifications as for residual H₂S in the treated gas are much more limitative than for CO₂ only whilst if in the acidic gases only CO₂ is contain ed, using or not using a distillative regeneration tower depends on the maximum allowed CO₂ content in the puri fied gas. Always in case the regeneration tower is present, a portion of the mixture leaving the expansion steps can be sent to the regeneration tower, whilst the other portion, not completely regenerated, can be recycled to the absorb er tower. The valuable components which evolve from the expan sions of the solvent rich in acidic gases are compressed, cooled and recycled to the absorber tower. The expansions of the solvent rich in acidic gases can be carried out in an expansion valve, or, at least partly, in a turbine. The regeneration by expansion of the solvent rich in acidic gases can be integrated with the heating of the same solvent, to the purpose of favouring the removal of the acidic gases by evaporation and recover cooling power to be used in the process. The expansion steps from which mainly acidic gases evolve can be from 1 to 4, producing streams of acidic gases under progressively lower pressures, of which, one or two can be kept under vacuum, in which case the acidic gases evolved must be compressed again. In some cases, on the contrary, operating under vacuum is not necessary, because the end pressure is a function of the temperature reached and of the purification level desired. The mainly acidic gases containing streams produced under high pressures can be expanded by means of an expansion valve, or of a turbine, to the delivery pres sure, to the purpose of producing work and refrigerating effect. The absorber tower or towers operates operate under a pressure comprised within the range of from 20 to 110 kg cm² and at a temperature comprised within the range of from 100 C to 40 C. In case the distillation tower for the regeneration of the solvent is present, said tower shall operate under a pressure comprised within the range of from 0.1 to 5 kg cm² and at a head temperature com prised within the range of from 60 C to 10 C and at a bottom temperature comprised within the range of from 10 C to 200 C. The invention shall be now better described by re ferring to the flow sheet of attached Fig. 1, which shows a preferred form of embodiment, which however must not be considered as limitative of the same invention. The raw gas is supplied to the plant by the piping 1, is cooled and partly condensed in 2 and is then sent to the separator 3 the liquid 4, which through the valve 5 is fed to the absorber tower 6, being separated from the not condensed gas 7. The not condensed gas 7 is cooled and partly condensed in 8 and is sent to the separator 9 from which the gas 10 not condensed in 8 evolves, and is fed, after being cooled in 11, to the absorber tower 6 through the valve 12, whilst the liquid 13 is fed in its turn, through the valve 14, to the absorber tower 6. In the heat exchangers 2, 8 and 11, the heat ex change can be carried out by taking advantage of the cooling power of the process streams. From the bottom of the absorber tower 6 a liquid 15 rich in acidic gases is obtained, which is regenerated by expansion. It is expanded in two steps through the valves 16 and 17 in the separators 18 and 19, from which the va pours 20 and 21, essentially constituted by methane and carbon dioxide, which are recycled to the tower 6 after being compressed in 22 and 23, are collected. From the bottom of the separator 19 a liquid 24 is obtained, which is essentially constituted by the solvent and by the removed CO₂, the latter being vapourized by expansion through the valves 25 and 26, and heating in the heat exchange assembly 27. Said heat exchange assem bly has been represented for simpleness sake as one single exchanger, but in reality it supplies the cooling power necessary to the process for example, in the heat exchangers 2, 8, 11 . Vapourized CO₂ is separated from the solvent in the separators 28 and 29,the first one being under a slight over pressure, the second under vacuum, maintained by the vacuum pump 30, and is discharged from the plant in 31. The regenerated solvent 32 outcoming from the bottom of the separator 29 is pumped by the pump 33 and mixed in 34 with the gas outcoming from the absorber tower. The mixture obtained is cooled in 35 and is separated in 36, the processed gas 37 being separated from the absorber solvent 38. The solvent 38, after being pumped in 39, is mixed in 40 with the gas outcoming from the absorber tower 6 the mixture obtained is cooled in 41 and separated in 42, the treated gas 43, which is subsequently mixed in 34 with the regenerated solvent 32, being separated from the solvent 44, which is pumped by the pump 45 to the absorb er tower 6. An Example is now supplied by using the flow sheet of Fig. 1, to the purpose of better illustrating the invention, which Example is not to be considered as being limitative of the same invention. A natural gas containing 80.85 by mol of CO₂, the balance being methane, available at 41 C and under 63 abs. atm. in an amount of 33,584 kmol h, is processed according to the flow sheet of Fig. 1, methane being obtained with a CO₂ amount of 2 by mol. After the initial cooling in the exchangers 2, 8 and 11, the incoming fluid is expanded to 40 abs. atm. As the solvent, methyl acetate is used. The treated gas is produced under 40 abs. atm. The circulation of solvent necessary to carry out the purification is of 134,000 kg h. The same natural gas as of Example 1 is processed according to the flow sheet of Fig. 2, which represents a process of the prior art. In said flow sheet the regene rated solvent 32 outcoming from the bottom of the separa tor 29 is pumped by the pump 33 and is mixed in 40 with the gas outcoming from the absorber tower. The mixture obtained is cooled in 41 and separated in 42, the treated gas 37 being separated from the solvent 44 which is pumped by the pump 45 to the absorber tower 6. Still using methyl acetate as the solvent, a circu lation of solvent of 389,000 kg h is necessary to perform the purification.
