# Method and apparatus for inspecting plated through holes in printed circuit boards.

## Abstract
To inspect plated through holes 4 in a printed circuit board 1 , light 6 from a light source is shone on the board. Light enters the through holes and also the light transmitting substrate 2 of the printed circuit board. A light detector 8 senses light from the holes and the signal from the light detector indicates the location of the holes. A located hole 4 is masked to prevent light shining on the board from directly entering the hole. The only light which now enters the hole, leaks from the substrate through defects 3a in the plating 3 . A light detector 8 senses light from the hole, and the signal from the light detector indicates the presence of defects, if any, in the plating of the through hole. Hence by signals supplied from light detectors, plated through holes can be continuously and efficiently inspected.
