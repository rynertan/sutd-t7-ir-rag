# Mixing valve apparatus.

## Abstract
A mixing valve apparatus provides a pressure balanc ing valve which can have fins on their valve members and is forced to rotate by hot and cold water flows. There are pro vided two valve means 36, 38 for controlling flows of hot and cold water, a temperature sensor 57 or possibly a flow rate sensor 58 . The valve means 36, 38 are shifted by re spective electric driving means 45, 51 which are driven by a controller 64 based on detected data of the temperature sensor and the flow rate sensor.
