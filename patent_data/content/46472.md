# Process and apparatus for recovering hydrocarbons from air hydrocarbon vapor mixtures.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for recovering hydro carbons from an air hydrocarbon vapor mixture. The air hydrocarbon vapor mixture is caused to flow through a first bed 12,14 of solid adsorbent, whereby the hydrocarbons are removed from the mixture and a residue gas stream by substantially hydrocarbon free air is vented to atmosphere and a second bed 14, 12 of solid adsorbent having hydrocarbons adsorbed thereon is desorbed by applying vacuum thereto using a liquid seal vacuum pump. The flow pattern is cyclically changed, so that air hydrocarbon vapor mixture is fed through a bed of solid adsorbent which has just been regenerated. Use of a vacuum pump 72 ensures that a major portion of the hydrocarbons is desorbed. Subsequent ly feeding a small quantity of heated hydrocarbon free air into the beds at 66 causes additional hydrocarbons to be stripped therefrom. The air hydrocarbon vapor mixture produced in the regeneration of the beds is contacted with a liquid absorbent whereby a major portion of the hydrocar bons are absorbed therefrom and recovered. The feed of the liquid absorbent is divided into two first and second streams, the first stream being heated by passing it in heat exchange relation with the seal liquid of the vacuum pump which is thus cooled. The first stream is then fed to the absorber at a location below that at which the second relatively cool stream is fed.
