# Wire identifying and terminating apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for identifying individual wires 20 a group of randomly ordered wires 20 and terminating the identified wires 20 in selected terminals 24A 24B of an electrical connector 24 in which the wires 20 are transported one by one from a wire feeding mechanism 2 by a wire transporting wheel 4 past a sensor 6 to a transfer mechanism 10 which moves the individual wires 20 axially into alignment with a wire terminating ram 34A or 34B of a terminating mechanism 22 . The wire terminating ram 34A or 34B is arranged to in dex along a row of terminals 24A or 24B extending axially of the wire transporting wheel 4 into alignment with respective terminals 24A and 24B in response to the identity of an indi vidual wire 20 . The wire transporting wheel 4 is arranged to rotate in either direction to divert an individual wire to either side of a connector 24 with rows of terminals 24A and 24B on both sides in response to the identity of the wire 20 .
