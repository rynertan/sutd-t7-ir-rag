# Small arm having a rotary magazine.

## Abstract
A firemarm has a spring motor powered rotary maga zine 16 having a plurality of circumferentially spaced cartridge chambers 18 . The magazine is rotatable discretely to align the chambers with the barrel and a firing pin 28 of a firing mechanism 22 . The magazine has stop pins 32 each being associated with a chamber 18 and being adapted to interfere with a first arresting face of a slide bar 36 operatively connected to the firing firing mechanism 22 , to arrest the magazine in a non aligned position. Depression of a trigger 24 cocks the mechanism 22 which urges the slide bar 36 rearwardly from underneath the stop pin 32 . This allows the magazine to be rotated to an aligned position, the stop pin interfering with a second arresting face to arrest the magazine. Further depression of the trigger causes the aligned cartridge to be fired. Slightly lagging in time, the slide bar 36 moves forward, pushes the stop pin 32 from the second arresting face and thus allows the magazine to rotate. A succeeding stop pin 32 interferes with the first arresting face to arrest the magazine in a non aligned position with respect to a succeeding chamber 18 . A loading opening is arranged in a back cover plate 62 to be aligned with a chamber 18 when a preceding chamber 18 is non aligned with the barrel. Partial depression of the trigger 24 against a safety mechanism 30 allows the firing mechanism 22 to be partially cocked only and to advance the magazine as described above to allow loading of the magazine.
