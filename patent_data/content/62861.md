## Description
This invention relates to formulations of herbicideN 3,4 dichlorophenyl propionamide common name Propa nyl more particularly it relates to emulsifiable concentrates of Propanyl free from isophorone and having cyclohexanone or 4 methyl cyclohexanone as a solvent. Propanyl of formula EMI1.1 is a herbicide compound active in post emergence and en dowed with a low toxicity towards mammalians LD 50 1384 mg kg . Propanyl has been widely employed since many years in agriculture, mainly for the selective weed killing in rice cultivations. Its solubility in water is very low 225 ppm at room temperature , furthermore it is little soluble in the organic solvents most widely utilized in the usual formulative practice, such as for example the aromatic solvents. For the weed killing in rice cultivations Propanyl is generally commercialized as an emulsifiable concentrate having isophorone 3,5,5 trimethyl 2 cyclohexen l one as solvent. The use of isophorone is mainly due to the fact thatPropanyl exhibits a good solubility in said solvent 60 by weght at 250C , and the aqueous emulsions obtained by dilution of the concentrate are physically stable and do not form precipitates in relevant amounts. It happens, on the contrary, that the emulsions in water of Propanyl solubilized in other organic solvents prove to be often physically little stable, with separation of oily or cream like precipatetes in a shor time. isophorone, although not particularly toxic in it self towards mammalias, possesses irritating properties and is suspected to be cancerogenic. These negative characteristics result in the fact that isophorone has been classified as a solvent belonging to the 1st toxicological class, subgroup b, according to E.E.C. Direction No. 80 781 of July 22, 1980. By consequence, the formulation for agricultural use containing isophorone are classified, according to the new directions at least in the 2nd toxicological class and require particular precautions and a certain experience on the part of the users Thst occurs also for the formulations of Propanyl in isophorone, in spite of the low dangerousness of the active product which cold be employed with greater safety iT it were properly formulated so as to avoid the ltil ization of isophorone or of other solvents of similar dangerousness. In the course our research work aiming at finding alternative Propanyl formulations not containing isophorone and, consequently, not exhibiting the drawbacks connected therPto, we have tested several combinations of organic solvents and surfactnts. The results were, altogether, very discouragirig because the aqueous emulsions prepared by dilution of the various concentrates caused in a short time, a phase separation with formation of oily or cream like precipitates. Siich drawback is not negligible in the agricultural applications, since during the treatment an insufficient amount of active products would be distributed at the begenning and a too high dose towards the end. On the contrary we have surprisingly found that emulsifishle concentratd of Propanyl containing cyclohexanone or 4 methyl cyclohexanone as a solvent and triethylhanolamine dodecylbenzenesulphonate in certain percentages, besides other components, lead to thp obtainment of stable aqueous emulsions. Thus, object nf the present invention are the emulsi fiable concentrates of herbicide Propanyl composed as follows A Propenyl ........... ........... 10 45 by weightB Cyclohexanone or 4 methyl cyclo hexanone ..................... 10 45 by weightC Triethanolamine dodecylbenzene sul phonate ........................ 3 15 by weightD Non ionic surfactants .......... 7 20 by weightE Aromatic solvents .......... 0 50 by weight Within the abovesaid ranges, the emulsifiable concentrates having the composition given hereinbelow are preferred for practical reasonsA Propanyl ...................... 25 35 by weightB Cyclohexanone or A nethyl cyclo hexanone , 25 40r by weight C Triethandamine dodecylbenzenesul phonate 4 4 z by weightD Non ionic surfactants ......... 10 20รง by weight E Aromatic solvents ............. 5 25 by weight. Cyclohexanone and 4methyl cyclohexanone are solvents endowed with a low toxicity towards nammaliansand do not exhibit the negative properties of isophorone in fact they are included in the nd toxicological class, sub grop d, of the above mentioned E.C.C. directions. Consequently it is apparent to those skilled in the formulation technique that the emulsifiable concentrates forming the object of the present invention do not exhibit the toxicilogical drawbacks of the ones containing isophorone. We have also found that, when Propanyl is employed 3S an aqueous emulsion obtained by diluting the emlsifi able concentrates object of this invention, it provides unexpectedly better results than the commercially available isophorone containing formulations, i.e. Propanyl preves more active as herbicide towards barnyard rass and less phytotoxic towards rice itself, when formulated according to the present invention. Tn the emulsifiable concentrates object of this invention, the minimum amount of active product is suggested exclusively by practical considerations with a view to containing thP formulate volllme in relation to the required amount of active product. The higher limit, of course, is limited by the content of the other ingredients. Also Propany.l technical grade is advantageously suited to the preparation of said form il Ations. The triethanolamine dodecylbenzenesulphonate is an anionic surfactant prepared from dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid and triethanolamine, wherefore its correct chemical name is triethanolammonium dodecylbenzenesulphonate. The denomination wised herein, however, is the one commonly used. The se of triethanolamine dodecylbenzene sulphonate has proved to be a particulary critical factor in stabilizing the aqueous emulsions of Propanyl solubilized in cyc lohexanone . In fact the non ionic surfactants are completely inadequate to tho purpose when employed without trjpthanolamine do decylbenzenesulphonate on the other hand it does not seem possible to replace the abovesaid surfactant with other anionic surfactants, since some tests carried out by nsinp calcium dodecylbenzenesulphonate or sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate in the concentrates the other components being equal have evidenced that oily precipitatPs promptly separate from the aqueous emulsions example 2 , and in the storage tests of the concentrate even the forming, of deposits pitches was observed. The non ionic surfactants component D employable in the formulation according to the present invention are the various polyoxyethylated surfactants, such as for example polyoxyethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated glycerides and polyoxyethylated fatty acids. To complete the formulations it is possible to employ aromatic solvents such as for example alkyl benzene frydro carbons and in particular the commercial mixtures of xylenes. The formulations according to the invention are prepared by simple mixing of the components without any part icular order of preference. To speed llp the dissolution of the active product it may be advisable to slightly heat the mixture 40 50 C . As mentioned hereinbefore, the biological properties of Propanyl as formlllated According to the present invention are somewhat improved in respect of the isophorone containing formulations, which Such differences concern an increase in the herbicide activity towards barnyard grass Echinochloa cr isgalli , the main infesting weed of rice coltures, and a reduction in the phytotoxicity towards rice itself example 3 are particularly unexpected when considering that in the compared formulations ths active product is the same. Tf desirable,it is possible to add to the formulations of this invention other active substances with the scope of widening the activity ranges or if so required hv particplar conditions of wise. Among the active substances capable of being co formdilated we may citP Csrbaryl common name of compound Nmethyl O 1 naphthyl carbamante , a well know syneriz ing agent of Propanyl, and the phenoxy acetic herbicides. For the practical applications in agriculture, the formulations object of the present invention are diluted in water, and the resulting emulsions are u s e d in thp treatemens usually recommended for Propanyl. The amount of emulsifiable concentrate to be employed is directly proportional to the active product amount that has to he employed in the defance of a certnin cultivation from the infesting weeds. The following examples are given to better illustrate the present invention.EXAMPLE 1Preparation of emulsifiable concentrates according to the present invention.General procedure A prefixed amount of Propanyl was mixed withollt any preferential order with prefixed amounds of cyclohexanone or of 4 methyl cyclohexanone , of aromatic solvent and of a previosly prepared mixture of the surfactants.The resulting mixture was heated to 40 50 C till obtaining a clear solution.For preparing the emulsifiable concentrates the following surfactants were utilized Emulson 255 registered trademark of POL Company for triethanolamine dodecylbenzenesulphonate Emulson 81C registered trsdemark of ROL Company for polyoxyethylated castor oil with A high content of ethyl enp oxide Emulson 20B registered trademark of ROL Company for polyoxyethylated nonyl phenol Emulson CO 25 registered trademark of ROT Company for polyoxyethylated ca.cttor oil with a medium content of ethylene oxide.

The small plants were then transferred to a glasshouse and, after three days, flooded again with a water layer of about 8 cm height. The plants were kept in the glasshouse during a 28 day period under the following conditions temperature ll 250C, photoperiod 12 hours, light intensity 1,500 lux.At the conclusion of such period, the vegetative state of the plants in comparison with untreated plants kept under the same conditions was observed. Both the herbicide activity on barnyard grass and the phytotoxicity towards rice were evaluated according to a scale of values ranging from 0 sound plant, growth like that of the check to 9 full stopping of the growth or death of the plant , the intermediate values representing intermediate situations of growth or of damages to the plants.In the test there were utilized aqueous emulsions prepared by diluting emulsifiable concentrate 1.2 see Table 1 according to the present invention and an emulsifiable concentrate referred to as 3.1 similar to the commercial formulations of Propanyl containing isophorone.
