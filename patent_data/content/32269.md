The sub frame also carries a switching member 28 50 , which comprises a switching fork 31 51 for transferring a belt 27 which constitutes a driving connection between the motor and the turntable. The switching member is movable between two stationary positions by a control member 42 62 mounted on the main frame and after the movement it is kept in the respective stationary position by positioning means 39 67 . In the two stationary positions the switching member is disengaged from the control member.
