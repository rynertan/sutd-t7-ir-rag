# Reading information optically.

## Abstract
In an optical disc player or other apparatus in which a light bead L is directed through an objective lens 12 to be focused thereby at a record medium surface for optically reading information recorded on a track on the surface, the lens 12 is mounted in one end of a tubular mounting member 11 through which the path of the light beam L extends longitudinally, a support member 14 extends about the mounting member 11 , a leaf spring member 13 , preferably of amorphous metal, extends between the other end of the mounting member 11 and the support member 14 to permit longitudinal movements of the mounting member 11 for correcting focusing errors, and further to permit swinging movements of the mounting member 11 about a centre located at the other end for correcting tracking and or time base errors, and a body 15 of substantially bulky elastic material, such as, polyurethane foam, is interposed between the support member 14 and the mounting member 11 at a location along the mounting member 11 intermediate its ends for further supporting the mounting member 11 .
