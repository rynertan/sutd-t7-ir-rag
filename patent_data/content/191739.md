# A METHOD OF FORMING, FROM A ROUGH FORGING, AN END MACHINED AND DRILLED BLANK FOR EXTRUSION ON A PIPE EXTRUDING PRESS, AND A MACHINE TOOL FOR IMPLEMENTING THE METHOD

## Abstract
A method of forming, from a rough forging, an end machined and drilled blank for extrusion on a pipe extruding press comprises the steps of drilling the rough forging axially on a lathe by means of a straight flute drill bit from one end, and of end machining it concurrently with the drilling step successively at the other end and said one end.
