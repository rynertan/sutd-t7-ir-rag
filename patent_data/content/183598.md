# A SHIELDED INTEGRATED CIRCUIT PACKAGE

## Abstract
An RF, EMI shielded printed circuit package 10 is provided by embedding within a plastic substrate 12 an electrically conductive cup 14 having an inwardly running lip 10 at the top surface of the plastic substrate 12 . An electrically conductive cap 14 is mechanically and electri cally secured to the inner edge of the lip 16 of the embedded cup 14 , thereby to form a completely RF, EMI shielded cavity in which is placed an integrated circuit chip 22 , with the lip 16 carrying external coaxial contact pads 36 . Connection to the integrated circuit chip 22 is from contact pads 36 formed in the inwardly running lip 16 of the cup 14 and is made via internal integral coaxial cable like components such that the chip 22 may be connected to an external coaxial cable via coaxial cable like structures running from the external contact pads 36 on the lip 16 through the plastic substrate 12 to internal contact pads 24 adacent the integrated circuit chip 22 . In one embodiment, a plasma etching step is performed after chemical development to increase pattern definition. The purpose of plasma etching is to clean up any microscopic organic contamination that has not been adequately re moved by the developing step in the printing. In addition, the plasma etch provides very clean edge definition so, when doing additive plating, no irregularities on the conductor edges are formed, which irregularities in high speed applica tions impede the flow of electrons.
