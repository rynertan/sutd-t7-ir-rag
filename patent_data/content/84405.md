# Device for detecting or controlling an interface between two liquids.

## Abstract
A device for detecting or controlling an interface 41 between two liquids A,B of differing properties comprises transmitting means 21 for transmitting impulses to said fluids A,B and detector means 22 for detecting the attenutation of said impulses in said fluids A,B , characte rised in that said detector means 22 are arranged to receive signals from first and second probes 10a, 10b and the latter are arranged to extend to different levels in said liquid A,B , the detector means 22 in operation producing an output or outputs representative of the position of the interface 41 .
