# Pneumatic tyre and process for manufacturing it.

## Abstract
Method of manufacturing a pneumatic tire having a cast body 12 of viscoelastic material, a road engaging tread sur face 11 and a girdle member 17 of reinforcing cords 18 lo cated in the crown area 14 of the cast body 12 . The method comprises the steps of assembling an annular hoop assembly 50 with the girdle member 17 located on the inner periphery of the hoop assembly 50 and a spacing support member 51 located on the outer periphery of the hoop assembly 50 in verting or turning the hoop assembly 50 inside out thereby lo cating the girdle member 17 on the outer periphery without changing its predetermined cord diameter, radius of curvature and cord tension and the spacing support member 51 on the inner periphery mounting the inverted hoop assembly 50 on the annular core 30, 31 of a tire mold 61 so that the girdle member 17 has its reinforcing cords 18 at the exact cord centerline diameter desired closing the tire mold 61 filling it with a viscoelastic material and curing the material. The me thod may be used to manufacture a tire with a tread of visco elastic material or of conventional, carbon black reinforced, rubber.
