# Method and device for the compensation of the thermal phase variations in the transfer function of a distributed parameters two port device.

## Abstract
The method of compensating thermal phase variations in the transfer function of a distributed parameters two port device LR consists in cascading same with a distributed parameter device DC , placed in the same room and having thermal phase variations of identical magnitude and opposit sign. The compensating device can be a transmission line or a part of the same two port device.
