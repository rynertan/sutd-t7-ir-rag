# Pneumatic yarn splicing equipment.

## Abstract
A slot 33 forming a splicing chamber is closed by sliding action between contacting surfaces of two bodies 23, 9 linked at an axis 7 which is perpendicularly spaced from both surfaces. The closure surface comprises the crown 49 of a piston 48 . The piston has a central orifice 51 and is slidable in a bore 47 in one of the bodies to which pressurized air is admitted. When the chamber is closed the orifice registers with the slot and allows a blast of air to pass from the bore into the slot.
