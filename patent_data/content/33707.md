# Element for liquid analysis having interferent removal zone and method for using same.

## Abstract
Elements for the analysis of liquids that contain interfer ents for an analyte assay are described. Interference is reduced by an interferent removing zone between the point of introduction of the liquid and an assay indicator zone. The interferent removing zone includes a discontinuous phase within a continuous phase. An interferent removing material is present in the discontinuous phase and the continuous phase is permeable to the analyte, its products, and or the liquid being analyzed.
