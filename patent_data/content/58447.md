## Description
Stabilizer composition for polymers or copolymers of vinyl chloride, polymer composition comprising such a stabilizer composition and shaped articles prepared therefrom.The invention relates to a stabilizer composition for polymers or copolymers of vinyl chloride in which an organic stabilizer, a metal salt of an acid, organic compound and a polyol are incorporated, to polymers or copolymers of vinyl choride in which a stabilizing amount of said composition is incorporated, and to shaped articles that are entirely or partly made of these stabilized polymers. Stabilizer compositions in which an organic stabilizer, a metal salt of an acid, organic compound and a polyol are incorporated are described in, int.al., British PatentSpecification 1 099 731 and British Patent Specification 1 230 933.Although the stabilizer compositions described in it make it possible to obtain polymers or copolymers of vinyl chloride possessing reasonable thermal stability and clarity, there is yet need for more effective stabilizer compositions. Especially needed are stabilizer compositions that are non toxic and suitable for use in industrial packaging material for foodstuffs. The present invention provides a stabilizer composition for polymers or copolymers of vinyl chloride of the known type indicated above and displaying improved thermal stability.The invention consists in that the polyol used is ditrimethylol propane in combination with a synergistic amount of some different polyol having 5 to 15 carbon atoms and 2 to 10 hydroxyl groups and a melting point not lower than 1000C.It should be added that the use of ditrimethylol propane in combination with some other polyol, viz. a mixture of trimethylol propane and pentaerythritol is described in British Patent Specification 1 400 919.Ditrimethylol propane is mentioned in it along with a great many other polyols. No mention is made in it at all of an organic stabilizer. An article by Abbas and Soervik in J. Vinyl Technol. 1980 2 2 , pp.87 94, does refer to it in discussing the results of testing a great many polyols for their effectiveness when used as co stabilizers of a calcium zinc system. However, it does not make any suggestions about the use of a combination of ditrimethylol propane with some other polyol to produce the valuable effect of the stabilizer compositions according to the present invention. The only polyol combination mentioned in it is a commercially available mixture of trimethylol propane and pentaerythritol.It has been found that the synergistic effect of the stabilizer compositions according to the invention is generally obtained when the weight ratio between the ditrimethylol propane and the other polyol is in the range of from 6 1 to 1 3.As examples of the polyols that may be used in tombination with ditrimethylol propane in the stabilizer compositions according to the invention may be mentioned mannitol, sorbitol, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol and or tripentaerythritol.It has been found that when the other polyol is a polyol having secondary hydroxyl groups, the weight ratio between the ditrimethylol propane and this polyol is preferably in the range of from 6 1 to 2 1.If, however, the other polyol is a polyol having primary hydroxyl groups, then preference is given to a weight ratio between ditrimethylol propane and this polyol in the range of from 3 1 to 1 1.Suitable for use in the stabilization of polyvinyl chloride or copolymers thereof are a great many organic stabilizers known from the literature.Examples thereof include ocphenyl indole, phenyl urea, N,N diphenyl thiourea, benzoyl alkaloyl methane having 12 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkaloyl group and or a nitrogen free ketoacetic acid compound having at least 8 carbon atoms. Benzoyl alkaloyl methane forms part of a large group of organic stabilizers described in German Patent Application 2 600 516. Nitrogen free ketoacetic acid compounds having at least 8 carbon atoms are described in British Patent Specification 1 099 731.Benzoyl alkaloyl methane is commercialized by Rhone Poulenc under the trade name Rhodiastab R50 and comprises a mixture of, int.al., benzoylstearoyl methane and benzoyl palmitoyl methane.Particularly the stearyl ester of acetyl acetic acid known from the last mentioned patent publication has been found to be particularly suitable for use in the stabilizer compositions of the present application. Various metals qualify for use in a metal salt of an acid, organic compound. The metal may be an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, strontium, magnesium and barium. Also mixtures of salts of various metals may be used, it being known that many of these mixtures produce improved effects, such as mixtures of zinc salts, cadmium salts, tin salts, lead salts, antimony salts, magnesium salts, bismuth salts, iron salts, cobalt salts, nickel and or copper salts with the alkali metal salts and or alkaline earth metal salts, for instance potassium stearates and zinc stearates, as described in U.S. Patent Specification 2 446 976, and mixed cadmium salts, lead salts or calcium salts and alkali metal salts, for in stance sodium salts and potassium salts, as described in U.S. PatentSpecification 2 181 478.When the present stabilizer compositions are employed in polymers that get into contact with food, it is preferred that use should be made of one or more metal salts of magnesium, cal cium or zinc. The amount of metal salt to be included in the polymer is usually in the range of 0,5 to 3 parts per 100 parts of the polymer. As suitable organic component of the metal salt may be used many acid, organic compounds. The most important requirement they must satisfy is that in the amount in which the metal salt formed therefrom is to be added it should be compatible with the polymer to be stabilized. Gener ally, the organic compound to be used contains at least 6 carbon atoms.Examples of suitable organic compounds include the aliphatic and cyclo aliphatic monocarboxylic acids that may be substituted or not with halogen atoms, sulphur and hydroxyl groups. Also suitable for use are substituted or unsubst ituted aromatic acids. Examples of suitable sub stituents include halogen atoms, alkyl groups and alkenyl groups. Ex amples of acids used in the form of the metal salts thereof include caproic acid, caprylic acid, decanecarboxylic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, ricinoleic acid, ethylacetylacetic acid, benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, salicylic acid, o benzoylbenzoic acid, naphthenic acid, methylfuran carboxylic acid and partially ester ified dibasic acids, such as the monobutyl ester of phthalic acid and the 2 ethoxyethyl monoester of maleic acid. Alternatively, in the sta bilizer compositions according to the present invention there may be incorporated the metal salts derived from the highly branched telomeric monocarboxylic acids according to U.S. Patent Specification 4 283 314. Their use offers the advantage that in many cases there is no need for the additional incorporation into the polymer composition of an internal and or external lubricant. Not only organic carboxylic acids, but also substituted or unsubstituted phenolic compounds may be employed to form the metal salts for use in the stabilizer compositions according to the invention. As a rule, the phenols are substituted with hydrocarbon substituents containing 4 to 24 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable phenols include n butyl phenol, isooctyl phenol, p phenyl phenol, octadecyl phenol and o or p phenyl phenol. Optionally, the stabilizer compositions according to the invention may contain internal and or external lubricants, antioxidants and or compounds to improve the impact resistance.These agents also may be added separately to the co polymer to be stabilized. The same applies to the separate constituents of the stabilizer compositions according to the invention.The amount of stabilizer composition is usually in the range of from 0,5 to 10, preferably 2 to 6 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of polymer.Per 100 parts of polymer or copolymer there will generally be incorporated 0,2 to 3 parts of polyol 0,1 to 1 part of a phenyl indole or a mixture of benzoyl alkaloyl methane 0,5 to 3 parts of metal salt s .Preference is given to adding 0,2 to 0,3 parts of organic stabilizer per 100 parts of polymer in a combination with a polyol having secondary hydroxyl groups, such as sorbitol. In the case where the organic stabilizer employed is a 3 ketoester, such as the stearyl ester of acetylacetic acid, these stabilizers are added in an amount of 0,3 to 2 parts, preferably 0,5 to 0,8 parts per 100 parts of polymer in combination with a polyol having primary hydroxyl groups, such as pentaery thritol and dipentaerythritol.The stabilizer compositions of the present invention are particularly suitable for improving the thermal stability of any conceivable type of polyvinyl chloride resin, however it may be prepared. In this connection mention is made of solution polymerization, emulsion polymerization and suspension polymerization. The term polyvinyl chloride as used herein not only embraces all conceivable types of homopolymers of vinyl chloride and post chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, but also copolymers having vinyl chloride as their major component, and a small amount of other copolymerizable monomers, such as copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate, copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride, copolymers of vinyl chloride and acrylonitrile, copolymers of vinyl chloride and maleic or fumaric esters and copolymers of vinyl chloride and styrene, and also mixtures containing a high proportion of polyvinyl chloride resin and a low proportion of some other synthetic resin, such as chlorinated polyethylene, copolymers of acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene.The invention is further illustrated in, but not limited by the follow ing examples.The heat stability ratings of the compositions stabilized were determined by first blending the various components of each specific formulation on a two roll laboratory mill for 5 minutes at 1600C until the mixture was entirely homogeneous. The sheet issuing from the mill was cut into test specimens about 1,5 mm thick. The specimens were heated in a forced circulation air oven at 1850C, from which they were removed at 15 minutes intervals, after which they were visually rated for colour change. This colour change was used as a measure of the decomposition rate of the PVC compound. The results of the test runs are denoted by a rating 0 through 6 .The rating of 0. indicates that the test specimen was colourless, the rating of 1 that it was a pale yellow, the rating of 2 that it was yellow, the rating of 3 that it was a light orange, the rating of 4 that it was orange, the rating of 5 that the specimen was red and the rating of 6 that it was black. Generally, a stabilizer composition is considered suitable for use when the colour development in the oven test sets in slowly a colour development from O to 1 in 60 minutes , a subsequent slow colour change from 1 to 3 or 4 takes place, and finally the colour gradually turns red to deep brown and black after at least 120 minutes.Example IThe following rigid PVC formulation was prepared and tested in the above described manner Parts by weightPVC 100EMI6.1 tb lubricant SEP 1t SEP cetyl stearyl SEP alcohol tb SEP butyl SEP montanate SEP 0,5 tb 2,6 di tert. butyl 4 methyl phenol 0,1 epoxidized soybean oil 3 calcium benzoate 0,29 zinc stearate 0,38 stearyl ester acetylacetic acid 0,67 polyol 0,67The results are summarized in the following table.

With the combination diTMP glycerol 2 1 the colour change sets in late. The change to black after 120 minutes, however, sets in fairly soon.The best results have been found to be obtained using the combination diTMP diPET in a weight ratio of 2 1.Example IIThe same test procedure was used as in Example I, except that the organic stabilizer employed had been prepared from a mixture of, int. al, benzoylstearoyl methane and benzoylpalmitoyl methane, marketed by RhonePoulenc under the trade name Rhodiastab R 50.The amount of Rhodiastab R 50 was 0,34 parts per 100 parts of PVC.
