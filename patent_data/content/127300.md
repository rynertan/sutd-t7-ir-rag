# Method of detecting edge welds during resistance spot welding.

## Abstract
During a weld period in the formation of a resistance spot weld the weld parameters are monitored, and data represent ing the weld resistance curve and the power curve are acquired and stored for analysis by a suitable programmed computer. An edge weld geometry is detected by calculating, from the weld resistance and power curves, the weld energy during the period of expulsion, if any, divided by the cumulative energy between the onset of melting and the end of expul sion, establishing a measure of expulsion intensity based on the maximum degree of resistance inflection, and predicting an edge weld on the basis of a weighted sum of the energy value and the infection value.
