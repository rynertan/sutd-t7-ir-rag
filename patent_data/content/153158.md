# Sealed pivot joint.

## Abstract
A sealed pivot joint suitable for joining together the adja cent links of an endless belt, for example, a tank track. The joint has a bearing 10 rotatable on a pin 8 , and an elastic sleeve 20 whose extremities are in sealed relationship to the pin and bearing thereby preventing the ingress of abrasive material into, and the egress of lubricant from, the bearing surface 12 . The sleeve is maintained in circumferential tension by tension ing members 14, 16, 18 between the sleeve and the pin which act to prevent wrinkling of the sleeve when the pin and bearing are rotated relative to one another thereby reducing abrasive wear on the outer surface of the sleeve.
