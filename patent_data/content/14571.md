During insta lation of the stair mat 30, the edge cover 31 is fixed on the forward edge 103 of the step 100, as shown in Figure 3, by use of the adhesive sheet not shown cut to length from the double faced adhesive tae. The front edge of the tread mat 32 is placed on the tread side tongue 35 with the trim studs 43 projecting into tile punched holes 42 of the tread mat 32. Then snap cap 44 are snapped onto the trim stud5 43, so as to fill up the punching holes 42 of the tread mat 32, and connect the tread mat 32 and the edge cover 31 together.And after connecting of the tread mat 32 and the edge cover 31 together as shown in Figures 3 and 4, the punched holes 42 are filled up with the pile of the snap caps 44, and the front edge of the tread mat 32 is adjacent to the edge bead cushion 34 of the edge cover 3 Then an adhesive sheet not shown is attached on the under surface at the centre and rear of the tread, and the tread mat 30 is fixed onto the tread 101 of the step 100. The stair mat 30 may be fixed on the step 100, after the tread mat 32 is previously connected with the edge cover. Figure 6 shows a modification including the edge cover 50 and the connecting means 51. The edge cover 50 is provided with a plurality of stud holes 52 which are formed by punching at fixed spaces on the tread side tongue 35, for a plurality of connecting means 51, that is to say, for the trim studs 53 of the connecting means 51. The connecting means 51 comprises the trim studs 53 and snap caps t14 produced from synthetic resin. A trim stud 53 is put into each stud hole 52, projecting upwardly from the tinder surface to the upper surface of the tread side tongue 53. Tile remaining parts of the edge cover 50 and the connecting means 51 are designated by the same numerals as those used for the corresponding parts of the edge cover 31 and te connecting means 33 of the above mentioned stair mat 30. Figure 7 shows a further modified stair mat 60. The stair mat 60 comprise an edge cover 61, a tread mat 62 and a plurality of connecting means 62 removably connecting the edge cover bl and the tread nat 62. The edge cover 61 is provided with a hollow cavity 63 extending along the length of the edge bead cushion 34. which cavity is modified of the cavities 37, 38 of the edge cover 31 of the abovementioned stair mat 50. The connecting means 62 comprises sockets 64 being of synthetic resin and snap inserts 65. Each socket 64 is fixed integrally on the tread side tongue 35 of the edge cover 61 by fusion, projecting upwardly from the tread side tongue 35, at the same spacing as the punched holes 42. The snap inserts 65 which fit into bores 6 of the sockets 64, have pile 68 similar to the pile 41 of the tread mat 32 on the upper surfaces of their heads 67. The stair mat 60 is fixed on the step 100 in the same way as the above mentioned stair mat 30, and the parts of the construction of te stair mat 60 ae designated by the same nuinerals as tllose used for the corresponding parts of the stair mat 30. Figures 8 to 12 show a further modified stair mat 70, which is instal ed on the s airs 100 of a building. The stair mat 70 comprises an edge cover 71 produced from synthetic resin, which is set on the forward edge 103 of the step, a tread mat 72 removably connected to the edge cover 71, which is set on the tread 101 of the step 100, and the connecting means 73. In tlie edge cover 71, the edge bead cushion 74 set on the forward edge 103 of the step 100, the tread side tongue 75 integrally extended from the bottom rear portion of the edge bead cushion 74 and the riser side tongue 76 integrally extended fro lle bottom front portion of the edge bead cushion 74, are formed in one united body in an extruder from synthetic resin. The edge bead cushion 74 is formed as a flexible vube as shown in Figures 9 and 10, and is provided with a non skid top surface por .on 78 on the upper surface thereof. The edge bead cushion 74 can be changed to have various cross sectional shapes. The hollow portion 77 may be comprised of a plurality of apertures.If the tread side tongue 75 and the riser side tongue 76 are formed in L sbape in cross section, the edge bead cushion 74 may be arcuate in shape, being extruded on the upper surface of the tread side fixing tongue 75 in the extruder. It is to be desired that the tread side tongue 75 and the riser side tongue 76 are made thin. Owing to the construction like this, the installation may be firm, and after installation the exfoliation by warping can be prevented. The tread mat 2 is made by cutting a carpet in a semi cylindrical shape, which is set on the tread 101 of the st9p 100. The connecting means 73 comprises a fastener, that is to say, a strip 79 with thousands of tiny loops 81 and a strip 80 with thousands of tiny iiooks 82. The strip 79 with the tiny loops 81 is fixed on the tread side tongue 75 of the edge cover 71, and the strip 80 with the tiny hooks 82 is fixed on the under surface of the front edge of the tread mt 72.When the front edge of the tread mat 72 is set on the tread side tongue 75 of the edge cover 71, the hooks 82 of the strip 80 engage with the loops 81 of the strip 79. Then, during the installation of the stair mat 70 on the stair 100, adhesive agent is applied on the under surfaces of the edge bead cushion 74 and the tread side tongue 75, and on the rear surface of the riser sid tongue 76. The edge cover 71 is placed on the forward edge 103 of the step 100 so as to put the riser side tongue 76 against the riser 102 of the step 100. Then the tread side tongue 75 is pressed on the tread 101 of the step 100, and the riserside tongue 76 is pressed on the riser 102 of the step 100. After the edge cover 71 is fixed on the forward edge 103 of the step 100, the front edge of the tread mat 72 is placed on the tread side tongue 75 of the edge cover 71 adjacent to the edge bead cushion 74 of the edge cover 71. The tread mat 72 is connected with the edge cover so as to engage the tiny hooks 82 of the strip 80 with the tiny loops 81 of the strip 79 which is already fixed on the tread side fixing tongue 75. The rear edge of the tread mat 72 is fixed on the tread 101 of the step 100 by the use of the fastener 83. The fastener 83 comprises a strip 84 with thousands of tiny loops which is fIxed on the tread 101 of the step 100 and a strip 85 witch thousands of tiny hooks 86 which is fixed on the under surface of the tread mat 72. By the above mentionde working process, the stair mat 70 is fixed on the step 100. 5illce the edge cover 71 and the tread mat 72, making up the stair mat 703 are assemblable and removable by means of the fastener 73, the edge cover 71 or the tread mat 72 can be easily changed for another. Figure 13 shows a modified stair mat 90. The stair mat 90 has the means of fixing modified from the above mentioned stair mat 70. As shown in Figure 13, the edge cover 91 is provided with a groove 92 extending along the length of the tread side tongue 75 of the edge cover 91. The strip 79 is ad hered on the groove 92, being put into the groove 92.Thus the thickness of the fastener 74 may be apparentiy thin, which fixes the tread mat 72 on the tread side tongue 75. The stair mat 90 is fixed on the step 100 in the same way as the above mentioned stair mat 70. The parts of the stair mat 90 are designated by the same numerals as those used for the corresponding parts of the stair mat 70, and a description of these parts is omitted. In the edge cover 90, if a pressure sensitive adhesive tape with a release paper or an adhesive layer with a release paper is applied on the under surface of the tread side tongue 75 and on the rear surface of the riser side tongue, the installation of the edge cover 91 on the forward edge 103 of the step 100 is facilitated. Since in the above mentioned stair mat 90 the edge cover 91 and the tread mat 72 are nsseniblable and removable by means of the fastener 73, that is to say, the strip 79 with thousands of tiny loops and the strip 80 with thousands of tiny hooks, either of the edge cover 91 or the tread mat 72 can be easily and economically changed for another according to an extent of the abrasion, the damagc and the corruption. Oing to the stair mat 90, the forward edge 103 of the step 100 is covered, giving the effects of non skid and cushioning to the step 100. Being attended with it, a serious injury by the missed footing can be prevented. As mentioned above, the described stair mats of the present invention are suitable as mats installed on the stairs of a building, especially where deadening of the sound of footsteps is required.
