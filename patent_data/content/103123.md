## Description
FLAME RETARDANT COPOLYESTER CARBONATE COMPOSITIONS This invention is directed to an improved flame retardant polyester carbonate composition of an aromatic polyestercarbonate in admixture with an organic alkali metal salt of sulfonic acid or an organic alkaline earth metal salt of sulfonic acid or a mixture thereof which composition has in admixture therewith a fluorinated polyolefin in sufficient quantity to render the polyester carbonate composition non dripping. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known in the art to render polycarbonate resins flame retardant and non dripping by admixing therewith an organic alkali metal salt or an organic alkaline earth metal salt of sulfonic acid, and a fluorinated polyolefin ApplicationSerial No. 949 964 filed Oct. 10, 1978 and assigned to the same assignee as the instant application . However, polyestercarbonate resins are quite different from polycarbonate resins.Thus, for example, polyester carbonates have a higher heat distortion temperature under load generally frcm about 500F. to about 600F. higher than polycarbonates, and are usually more difficult to process because of their higher.intrinsic viscosity than polycarbonates. It is this difference in properties, especially the heat distortion temperature, that provides one of the main reasons for using polyester carbonates in place of polycarbpnates in certain applications. This is particularly true where there is a high temperature environment. In spite of the disadvantage of the more difficult processability of the polyester carbonate resin it is still preferred over the polycarbonate resin in these applications because of its higher heat distortion temperature. However, this main advantage of polyester carbonates makes it especially important that they be made flame retardant and non dripping since they are used in high temperature environments where the chances of ign ition and burning are increased. It is well known to those in the field that the area of modification of the physical properties of a polymer, e.g flame retardance, by the audition thereto of certain additives is largely an empirical art rather than a predictable science with little, if any, predictability on the effects a certain additive will have in a particular polymer system. Thus, while a particular additive may have one effect in one polymer system the same additive may well produce entinsy different results when used in another and different polymer system. Likewise, two rather closely related additives may produce entirely different results when admixed with the same polymer. The present situation is even more complicated in that two entirely dissimilar additives, i.e. i an organic alkali metal salt of sulfonic acid or an organic alkaline earth metal salt of sulfonic acid, and ii fluorinated polyolefin, are employed. There thus exists a need for flame retardant and nondripping aromatic polyester carbonate resins. DESCRIPTION OF TRE INVENTION It has surprisingly been discovered that an aromatic polyester carbonate can be made both flame retardant and nondripping by incorporating with the aromatic polyester carbonate i an organic alkali metal salt of sulfonic acid, an organic alkaline earth metal salt of a sulfonic acid or mixtures thereof and Cii a fluorinated polyolefin. The polyester carbonates which find use in the instant invention and the methods for their preparation are well known in the art as disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,030,331 3,169,121 4,194,038 and 4,15E,069 as well as in copending applicationSerial No. 33,389 filed April 26, 1979 and assigned to the same assignee as the instant application, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The polyester carbonates can generally be termed copolyesters containing carbonate groups, carboxylate groups, and aromatic carbocyclic groups in the polymer chain, in which at least some of the carboxylate groups and at least some of the carbonate groups are bonded directly to ring carbon atoms of the aromatic carbocyclic groups. These polyester carbonates are, in general, prepared by reacting a difunctional carboxylic acid or a reactive derivative of the acid sucri as the acid dihalide, a dihydric phenol and a carbonate precursor. The dihydric phenols useful in formulating the polyestercarbonates which are of use in the practice of the present invention are in general represented by the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein A represents an aromatic group such as phenylene, biphenylene, naphthylene, etc. E may be an alkylene or alkylidene group such as methylene, ethylene, propylene, propylidene, isopropylidene, butylene, butylidene, isobutylidene, amylene, isoamylene, amylidene, isoamylidene, etc. Where E is an alkylene or alkylidene group, it may also consist of two or more alkylene or alkylidene groups connected by a non alkylene or non alkylidene group such as an aromatic linkage, a tertiary amino linkage, an ether linkage, a carbonyl linkage, a siliconcontaining linkage, or by a sulfur containing linkage such as sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, etc.In addition, E may be a cycloaliphatic group e.g., cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, etc. a sulfur containing linkage, such as aulfide, sulfoxide or sulfone an ether linkage a carbonyl group a tertiary nitrogen group or a silicon containing linkage such as silane or siloxy.R represents hydrogen or a monovalent hydrocarbon group such as alkyl methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc. , aryl phenyl, naphthyl, etc. , aralkyl benzyl, ethylphenyl, etc. , alkaryl, or cycloaliphatic cyclopentyl, cyclohsryl , etc. . Y may be an inorganic atom such as halogen fluorine, bromine, chlorine, iodine , an inorganic group such as the n itro group, an organic group such as R above, or an oxy group such as OR, it being only necessary that Y be inert to and unaffected by the reactants and reaction conditions The letter m represents any integer from and including zero through the number of positions on A available for substitutuion p represents an integer from and including zero through the number of positions on E available for substitution t represents an integer equal to at least one a is either zero or one and u represents any integer including zero. In the dihydric phenol compound represented by Formula I above, when more than one Y substituent is present, they may be the same or different. The same hold true for the R substituent. Where 5 is zero in Formula I and u is not zero, the aromatic rings are directly joined with no intervening alkylene or other bridge. The positions of the hydroxyl groups and Y on the aromatic nuclear residues A can be varied in the ortho, meta, or para positions and the groupings can be in vicinal, asymmetrical or symmetrical relationship, where two or more ring carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon residue are substituted with Y and hydroxyl groups. Some nonlimiting examples of dihydric phenols falling within the scope of Formula I include 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxypheflyl propane bisphenol A 2,4 dihydroxydiphenylmethane bis 2 hydroxyphenylJmethane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 5 nitrophenyl methane bis 4 hydroxuy 2,6 dimethyl 3 methoxyphenyl mathane l,l bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 1, 1 bis 4 hydroxy 2 chlorophenyl ethane 2,2 bis 3 phenyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclohexylmethane and 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphanyl l phenylpropane. These dihydric phenols may be used alone or as mixtures of two or more different dihydric phenols. In general, any difunctional carboxylic acid or its reactive derivative such as the acid dihalide conventionally used in the preparation of polyesters may be used for the preparation of the polyester carbonates useful in formulating the flame retardant non dripping compositions of the present invention In general, the carboxylic acids which may be used are aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic aromatic carboxylic acids, or aromatic carboxylic acids. The aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their reactive derivatives such as the aromatic acid dihalides are preferred as they produce the aromatic polyester carbonates which are most useful in the practice of the present invention. These carboxylic acids may be represented by the general formulaEMI6.1 wherein R1 represents an alkylene, alkylidene or cycloaliphatic group in the same manner as set out above for E in Formula I an alkylene, alkylidene or cycloaliphatic group containing ethylenic unsaturation an aromatic radical such as phenylene, nathylena, biphenylene, substituted phenylene, etc. two or more aromatic groups connected through non aromatic linkages such as those defined by E in formula I or an aralkyl radical such as tolylene, xylene, etc. R2 is either a carboxyl or a hydroxyl group. The letter q represents one where R2 is a hydroxyl group and either zero or one wherein R2 is a carboxyl group. Thus the difunctional acid will either be a monohydroxy monocarboxylic acid or a dicarboxylic acid.For purposes of the present invention the dicarboxylic acids or their reactive derivatives such as the acid dihalides are preferred, with the aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their dihalides being more preferred. Thus, in these more preferred acids R2 is a carboxyl group and R1 is a divalent aromatic radical such as phenylene, naphthylene, biphenylene, substituted phenylene, etc. two or more aromatic groups connected through non aromatic linkages or a divalent aralkyl group.Some nonlimiting examples of suitable preferred aromatic and aliphatic aromatic dicarboxylic acids wtich may be used in preparing the polyester carbonates useful in the practice of the present invention include phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, homophthalic acid, o , m , and p phenylenediacetic acid the polynuclear aromatic acids such as diphenic acid, and l,4 naphthalic acid. These acids may be used either individually or as a mixture of two or more different acids. The carbonate precursor may be a carbonyl halide, a carbonate ester or a haloformate. The carbonyl halides which can be employed herein are carbonyl chloride, carbonyl bromide and mixtures thereof. Typical of carbonate esters which may be employed herein are diphenyl carbonate, di halophenyl carbonates such as di chlorophenyl carbonate, di bromophenyl carbonate, di trichlorophenyl carbonate, di tribromophenyl carbonate, etc. di alkylphenyl carbonates such as di tolyl carbonate, etc., di naphthyl carbonate, di chloronaphthyl carbonate, phenyl tolyl carbonate, chlorophenyl chloronaphthyl carbonate, etc., or mixtures thereof.The haloformates suitable for use herein include bishaloformates of dihydric phenols bischloroformates of hydroquinone, etc. or glycols bishaloformates of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, polyethylene glycol, etc. . Carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene, is preferred. Also present during the co reaction between the dihydric phenol, the carbonate precursor and the dicarboxylic acid or its reactive derivative are catalysts, molecular weight regulators, and acid acceptors. Examples of suitable motecular weight regulators include phenol, p tertiary butyl phenol, etc.Examples of suitable catalysts include tertiary amines, quaternary ammonium compounds, quaternary phosphonium compounds, etc. Examples of suitable acid acceptors include tertiary amines alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, etc. The polyester carbonates which are useful in the practice of the present invention are the aromatic polyester carbonates derived from dihydric phenols, aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their reactive derivatives such as the aromatic acid dihalides, e.g. dichlorides, and phosgene. A quite useful class of aromatic polyester carbonates are those derived from bisphenoA terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, or a mixture thereof or terephthaloyl dichloride, isophthaloyl chloride , or a mixture thereof and phosgene. If a mixture of terephthaloyl and isophthaloyl dichloride is utilized the ratio by weight of terephthaloyl dichloride to isophthaloyl chloride is from about 5 95 to 95 5. The instant invention is directed to novel flame retardant and non dripping compositions containing, in admixture a an aromatic polyester carbonate resin b at least one compound selected from organic alkali met salts of sulfonic acid and organic alkaline earth metal salts of sulfonic acid and c a fluorinated polyolefin. The fluorinated polyolefins used in this invention as drip retarding agents are commercially available or can be prepared by known processes. They are white solids obtained by polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene, for example, in aqueous media with free radical catalysts, e.g., sodium, potassium or ammonium peroxydisulfates at 100 to 1,000 psi at 0 200 C and preferably at 20 100 C See Brubaker, U.S. Patent 2,393,967, which is incorporated herein by reference. While not essential, it is preferred to use the fluorinated polyolefins in the form of relatively large particles. e.g., of average size of 0.3 to 0.7 mm, mostly 0.5 mm. These are better than the usual polytetrafluoroethylene powders which have particles of from 0.05 to 0.5 millimicrons in diameter.It is especially preferred to use the relatively large particle ize material because, it tends tc disperse readily in polymers and bond them together into fibrous materials. Such preferred polytetrafluoroethylenes are designated by ASTM as Type 3, and are available commercially from the E. I DuPont de Nemour and Company under the tradenaa Teflon. The amount of the fluorinated polyolefin used in the compositions of the present invention is a drip retarding amount.By this is meant an amount of fluorinated polyolefin effective to retard the dripping of flaming particles from a burning aromatic polyester carbonate formed article. Generally this amount ranges from about 0.01 to about 3 weight percent based on the weight of the aromatic polyester carbonate resin. Preferably the composition contains from about 0.02 to about 2 weight percer of the polyolefin based on the weight of the polyester carbonate, and more preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.50 weight percent of the polyolefin.

DESCRIPIICN OF THE PEEMlnERED EMBODIMENT The following examples are set forth to further illustrate the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention thereto. Unless otherwise specified, where parts or percents are mentioned, they are parts or percents by weight. EXAMPLE 1 Control To a.reactor fitted with a mechanical agitator are charged 6 liters of deionized water, 10 liters of methylene chloride, 1,910 grams 8.36 moles of bisphenol A, 24 milliliters of triethylamine, 3.4 grams of sodium gluconate and 65 grams 0.43 mole of p tertiary butyl phenol. This reaction mixture is stirred and to the stirred mixture are added, over a 15 minute period, a mixture of 890 grams of terephthaloyl dichloride and 160 grams of isophthaloyl dichloride as a 25 weight percent solids solution in methylene chloride.During the acid chloride addition the pH is maintained in the range of 8.5 to 11.5 by the addition of 25 aqueous s9dium hydroxide The resulting reaction mixture is then phosgenated by the introduction of phosgene at the rate of 36 granslminute for 15 minutes with the pH controlled at 9.5 to 12 by the addition of the aqueous sodium hydroxide.After phosgenatiom is terminated 6 liters of methylene chloride are added, the brine layer is separated by centrifuge and the resin solution is washed with aqueous acid and with water. The resin is steam precipitated and dried in a nitrogen fluid bed drier at approximately 240 F.

The pellets are then injection molded at about 6200F.into test samples measuring about 2 1 2 x.1 2 X 1 8 . Examples 2 7 illustrate compositions falling outside the scope of the instant invention because these compositions, while containing the alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of sulfonic acid, do not contain the fluorinated polyolefin.

The mixture is extruded and molded into test samples in the same manner as described in Example 1. The following example illustrates a composition of the instant invention which also optionally contains fiber glass. EXAMPLE 11 To the aromatic polyester carbonate prepared substantially in accordance with the procedure of Example 1 are added 0.5 parts by weight of a mixture of i the potassiumisalt of diphenyl sulfone 3 sulfonic acid and ii the dipotassium salt of diphenyl sulfone 3,31 disulfonic acid, 0.24 parts by weight of poLytetrafluoroethylene, and 1.5 parts by weight of fiber glass per hundred parts by weight of polyester carbonate resin. The mixture is extruded and molded into test samples in the same manner as described in Example 1 The test samples prepared in Examples 1 11 are subjected to a test procedure to determine the flammability and dripping characteristics of these samples.This test procedure is a modified ASTM D 3713. The modification consists in that only 5 samples of each lot are tested and only for a 60 second flame impingement time. In accordance with this modified test procedure materials so investigated are rated as either passing or failing based on the results obtained from the testing of 5 specimens. The criteria for passing or failing is briefly as follows Passing If a. sample extinguishes within 30 seconds after removal of the igniting flame and none of the specimens drip flaming particles which ignite absorbent cotton placed 12 below. Failing i Any one specimen failing to extinguish within 30 seconds after removal of the flame and or ii Any one specimen produces flaming droplets either during the period it is in contact with the flame or after removal of the flame igniting absorbent cotton placed 12 below. Furthermore, all 5 samples must pass in order to receive a passing rating. If any one of the 5 specimens fails, all five sample bars are considered as failing. The results of this test are set forth in Table I The samples produced in Examples 8 11 are also subjected to the following test procedures Beat Distortion Temperature Under Load DTUL of the molded samples was determined according to ASTM D 648modified by use of Example I type bars Notched Izod NI impact on the molded samples was determined according to ASTM D 256. The results of these tests are set forth in Table II. It is clear from the data in Table I that in order to obtain a passing rating under the procedures of ASTM D 3713 the polyester carbonate composition must contain both the fluorinatec polyolefin and the alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of sulfonic acid. However, it need not additionally contain glass fibersThis is in sharp contrast to polycarbonate compositions which in order to be rated passing under ASTM D 3713 must contain i a fluorinated polyolefin, iL an alkali or alkaline earth metal TABLE 1 EMI19.1 Parts SEP of SEP Parts SEP of SEP Fluo SEP Parts SEP of SEP ASTM SEP D 3713 tb Example SEP No. SEP Salt SEP Additive SEP Salt SEP Additive SEP rinated SEP Polyolefin SEP Fiber SEP Glass SEP Rating tb 1 SEP none SEP none SEP none SEP none SEP Fail tb 2 SEP STB SEP 0.25 SEP none SEP none SEP Fail tb 3 SEP STB SEP 0.5 SEP none SEP none SEP Fail tb 4 SEP STB SEP 0.75 SEP none SEP none SEP Fail tb 5 SEP KSS SEP 0.5 SEP none SEP none SEP Fail tb 6 SEP KSS SEP 0.5 SEP none SEP 1.5 SEP Fail tb 7 SEP KSS SEP 0.5 SEP none SEP 3.0 SEP Fail tb 8 SEP STB SEP 0.75 SEP 0.12 SEP none SEP Pass tb 9 SEP STB SEP 0.5 SEP 0.24 SEP none SEP Pass tb 10 SEP STB SEP 0.75 SEP 0.24 SEP none SEP Pass tb 11 SEP KSS SEP 0.5 SEP 0.24 SEP 1.5 SEP Pass tb STB is sodium 2,4,5 trichlorobenzenesulfonate.

The data in Table II illustrates that these characteristics of flame retardancy and non dripping arc achieved without any significant adverse effects upon the other advantageous physical properties of the aromatic polyester carbonate resin the DTUL of the resin of Example 1 is 323 F and the NI is 7.4 ft.lb. in. . As previously mentioned the composition of the instant invention may optionally contain fiber glass. By fiber glass, it is understood that glass silk, as well as all glass fiber materials derived therefrom including glass fiber fabrics, rovings, stable fibers and glass fiber mats are included. The length of the glass filaments and whether or not they are bundled into fibers and the fibers bundled in turn to yarns, ropes or rovings, or woven into mats, and the like, also are not critical to the invention However, when using fibrous glass filaments, they may first be formed and gathered into a bundle known as a strand. In order to bind the filaments into a strand so that the strand can be handled, a binder or binding agent is applied to the glass filaments. Subsequently, the strand can be chopped into various lengths as desired. It is convenient to use the strands in lengths of from about 1 8 to about I long, preferably less than 1 4 in length. Preferably, the composition contains from about 1 to about 50 weight percent of the glass fibers. It will thus be seen that the objects set forth hereinabove among those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained, and since certain changes may be made in carrying out the above process and in the compositions set forth without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matters contained herein shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. As used throughout this specification and claims, the minimum amount of residue from the dicarboxylic acid or dicarboxylic acid reactive derivative present in the copolyester carbonate is about 25 mole percent, the mole percentage based upon the moles of diphenol residue present in the copolyester carbonate. Since the reactions for preparing the polyosteroarbonate go essentially to completion, the mole percent of residue in the copolyestercarbonate is essentially the same as the mole percent of reactants. A range of about 25 to about 90 mole percent dicarboxylic acid or dicarboxylic acid reactive derivative residue is generally appropriate. A preferred range is from about 35 to about 80 mole percent.
