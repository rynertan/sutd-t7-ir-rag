## Description
This invention relates to well logging and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for determining and or using textural formation properties to obtain improved well logs. In the well logging art, there are a number of properties of subsurface formations which are considered commercially important, and which have been the object of continuing efforts to identify techniques for improving measurement and intepretation accuracy. For example, a form of the well known Archie equation relates the conductivity of the formation, σ , to the conductivity of the water in the formation, σ where where In many instances, the total porosity, From this simplified description, it will be understood that it is desirable to devise techniques for more accurately determining the water filled porosity and the cementation of formations surrounding a borehole, and it is among the objectives of the present invention to set forth such techniques. It has long been recognized in the well logging art that a knowledge of the dielectric permittivity of a formation surrounding a borehole would provide useful information concerning the nature of fluids in the formation, since there is a striking contrast between the dielectric constant of water about 80 and the dielectric constant of hydrocarbons about 5 . The development of the electromagnetic propagation types of devices, such as the electromagnetic propagation tool EPT described in U.S. Patent No. 3,944,910, assigned to the same assignee as the present application, provided an improved technique for determining formation dielectric permittivity, as well as conductivity, at shallow depths of investigation. In applying the measurements obtained with an electromagnetic propagation type of device, it would again be desirable to have more accurate indications of the formation water filled porosity and cementation which, in the case of the invaded zone, would provide useful information concerning the degree to which available hydrocarbons are capable of being flushed from the rock. Also, it would be desirable to have a means for better determining and interpreting the dielectric permittivity and conductivity as obtained from an electromagnetic propagation type of device, and it is among the further objects of the present invention to provide these improvements. It has been recognized that the textural nature of the formation matrix can play an important role in affecting the electrical properties of rocks, although there has been an absence of practical application in the well logging art. It is among the further objects of the present invention to devise well logging techniques which can be used for determination of the textural properties of a formation matrix, and to use these properties in obtaining other formation parameters. The invention is set out in method claim 1 and apparatus claim 18. Further embodiments are set out in the dependent claims. The present invention has particularly advantageous application in clean carbonate formations in which a salty drilling mud has been used. However, the invention can be used in other situations, for example with a clay correction, if clays are present in small amounts. Also, while the invention is well suited for use in conjunction with logging devices which measure invaded zone parameters, it also has application for use in conjunction with deeper investigation devices. The invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

FIG.s 18 and 19 respectively show dielectric permittivity and conductivity versus frequency obtained using a model which includes hydrocarbon. Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a representative embodiment of an apparatus in accordance with the present invention for investigating subsurface formations 31 traversed by a borehole 32. The borehole 32 is typically filled with a drilling fluid or mud which contains finely divided solids in suspension. The investigating apparatus or logging device 40 is suspended in the borehole 32 on an armored cable 33, the length of which substantially determines the depth of the device 40. The cable length is controlled by suitable means at the surface such as a drum and winch mechanism not shown . Circuitry 51, shown at the surface, although portions thereof may typically be downhole, represents processing circuitry for the various logging units of apparatus 40. The investigating apparatus 40 includes a suitable shallow investigation resistivity determining device such as a microresistivity device 41, which may be of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 3,760,260. As is known in the art, the device 41 may include skid sidewall 41a which takes measurements used to determine the conductivity σ The downhole investigating apparatus also includes a neutron exploring device 42 which may be, for example, of the type disclosed, in U.S Patent No. 3,483,376. The neutron count is received by a processing circuit in the overall circuitry 51 which includes a function former that operates in well known manner to produce a signal The investigating apparatus includes a further device 44 which is a gamma ray logging device for measuring the natural radioactivity of the formations. The device 44, as known in the art, may typically include a detector, for example a gamma ray counter, which measures the gamma radiation originating in the formations adjacent the detector. An output of circuitry 51 is a signal designated GR which represents the gamma ray log reading. If necessary and desired, a clay correction can be applied in the present invention, using the gamma ray log reading. An electromagnetic propagation tool EPT 46 is provided, and includes a pad member 46A that has transmitting and receiving antennas therein. Microwave electromagnetic energy is transmitted through the formations typically the invaded zone and formation characteristics are determined by measuring the travel time and attenuation of received energy. This type of logging tool is described in U.S. Patent No, 3,944,910. Measurements indicative of attenuation, designated ATT, and of travel time corresponding to phase designated t where the attenuation has been previously corrected for spread loss. The processing circuitry for developing these logged values is contained within the processing circuitry 51, and ε To keep the investigating apparatus 40 centered in the borehole, extendable wall engaging members 43B and 46B may be provided opposite the members 43A and 46A. For centering the upper portion of the investigating apparatus, centralizers 49 may also be provided. It will be understood that various alternative means can be provided for arranging, configuring, and mounting the devices shown, or similar devices. The signal outputs of block 51 are illustrated in FIG. 1 as being available to computing module 500 which, in the present embodiment, is implemented by a general purpose digital computer, such as a model PDP 11 sold by Digital Equipment Corp. It will be understood, however, that a suitable special purpose digital or analog computer could alternatively be employed. The outputs of the computing module 500, illustrated in FIG. 1, are signal values developed in accordance with techniques described hereinbelow. These signals are recorded as a function of depth on recorder 90, which generically represents graphical, electrical and other conventional storage techniques. While all of the measurements to be used in practising the invention are shown, for ease of explanation in the illustrative embodiments, as being derived from a single exploring device, it will be understood that these measurements could typically be derived from a plurality of exploring devices which are passed through the borehole at different times. In such case, the data from each run can be stored, such as on magnetic storage media, for subsequent processing consistent with the principles of the invention. Also, the data may be derived from a remote location, such as by transmission therefrom. Before further describing operation of the embodiments hereof, the background theory and underlying theory will be discussed There has previously been set forth the so called iterated dilute limit method of representing the electrical propeties of a mixture of materials see Sen, Scala, and Cohen A Self Similar Model For Sedimentary Rocks With Application To The Dielectric Constant Of Fused Glass Beads , Geophysics, Vol. 46, No. 5 . In this method, one starts with all water, and adds infinitesimal amounts of insulating e.g. quartz grains of a specified shape. Successive integrations are performed, up to a solid fraction 1 porosity of interest. Starting with water as a host ensures that the rock mixture remains conducting down to very low porosities. In the referenced Sen et al. paper, the expression set forth for the incremental complex dielectric constant, in a particular case wherein the grains are spherical, is where V and v are the total volume of water and rock, respectively, ε is the complex dielectric permittivity of the rock and differentiating 7 gives Using equation 8 in equation 6 gives Integrating expression 9 from ψ 0 to ψ 1 , with the boundary condition that ε It was noted that high aspect ratio plate shaped grains can give rise to a large value of the rock s dielectric permittivity. Because of their geometry, the platey grains collect charge, and the charge polarizations can have a profound effect on the complex dielectric constant of the rock. General expressions were developed for cases of particles of different shapes, sizes, and orientations. See Sen, Relation Of Certain Geometrical Features To The Dielectric Anomaly Of Rocks , Geophysics, Vol. 46, No. 12 and Mendelson and Cohen, The Effect of Grain Anisotropy On The Electrical Properties Of Sedimentary Rocks , Geophysics, Vol. 47, No. 2 . For a distribution of grain depolarization ratios L, the following expression was set forth the angular brackets denoting an average over the distribution of L values. As frequency decreases, the conductivity term is the major contribution to the complex dielectric constant. In the D.C. limit, equation 11 above gives and, by integration, gives Archie s law where σ For a single value of L, averaging is redundant, and the following expression is obtained by integrating equation 11 However, models with a single particle shape have been found to not provide an adequate representation of the formations. More general models, such as for an arbitrary probability distribution of grains of different aspect ratios, lead to forms of equation 11 which do not lend themselves well to integration and can lead to relationships with too many variables for efficiently representing the formation properties. Such general approaches have not led to a satisfactory model of the formation properties. In the model used in the present embodiment of the invention, the rock matrix is assumed to comprise two types of grains i.e. spherical grains and platey grains. The infinitesimal amounts of grains added to water at each step include both spherical grains and platey grains, which are ellipsoids of revolution in this model, with a fixed aspect ratio i.e., ratio of length to width . The grains are assumed to be uniformly distributed in orientation, so the model is isotropic. Accordingly, the bimodal model has two geometrical parameters the fraction p of the matrix which is platey grains, and the particle depolarization ratio, L which describes the electrical effect of the particle aspect ratio. The unity complement of L is δ 1 L, and this is the parameter used below. It is known that if L is the depolarization factor along the principal axis, L₁ L and L₂ L₃ 1 L₂ 2, and if a₁ , a₂ , and a₃ are the semi major axes, then for an oblate spheroid For spherical grains L 1 3. A simplified pictorial representation of the bimodal model geometry used in the embodiments hereof is shown in FIG. 2. The black circles and ovals represent grains, and the white space represents water. Each size of particle represents one step in the iterated dilute limit method. In the illustration of the FIGURE, a 3 step approximation i.e., 3 particle sizes of the actual method is shown. In the integration, each particle size is considered to see the effective medium resulting from the previous steps, rather than the actual particles involved in those steps. This effective medium approximation is valid if the particles added at each step are much larger than those of the preceding step. For the stated bimodal model, with a value of L 1 δ with a probability p for the platey grains, and a value L 1 3 with a probability 1 p for spherical grains, 8 above gives Expression 17 can be integrated by partial fractioning to give where the coefficients and complex coefficients are In the low frequency limit, expression 18 gives Archie s law e.g. equation 13 , but with Referring to FIG. 3, there are shown curves, based on the bimodal model of the relationship 18 , of dielectric permittivity vs. frequency and conductivity vs. frequency for a water filled rock sample from a carbonate that is primarily calcite. In this example the rock sample used had a water filled porosity, The dielectric measurements of the FIG. 3 example were made, at room temperature, by measuring the reflection and transmission characteristics of the sample in a sample cell using a network analyzer see M.S. Freedman et al., J. Phys. E Sci. Inst. 12,899, 1979 . The sample cell consisted of a section of coaxial waveguide in which the rock sample constituted the dielectric medium between inner and outer conductors of the waveguide. Teflon plugs at each end of the sample were used as seals to contain the water content in the sample. The dielectric constant and conductivity of the sample were computed using both forward and reverse scattering parameters. See, for example, Palaith Chang, Improved Accuracy For Dielectric Data , The Institute For Physics, 1983. In FIG. 3 the size of the uncertainty bar associated with each point was derived using the manufacturer s stated accuracy for the equipment at each frequency. FIG. 4 is another diagram which shows measured values of dielectric permittivity, ε , and conductivity, σ σ FIG. 5 illustrates the dependence on frequency of the method used in obtaining the bimodal model curves of FIG. 4. Curves are shown for four different carbonate primarily dolomite rock samples in this FIGURE, identified as sample numbers 3, 4, 5 and 7. In this particular example, measurements were made at 151 different frequencies for each sample. Accordingly, the so called quality of fit scale on the vertical axis of FIG. 5 goes up to a maximum value of 151. The plot shows the number of measurement frequencies at which the model value of dielectric permittivity fit inside the error bars. FIG. 6 illustrates the values of the platey grain fraction p and the depolarization complement δ at the local maxima of the quality of fit curves e.g. FIG. 5 for ten carbonate rock samples identified as sample numbers 1 through 13A sable 10 had been utilized in the FIG. 4 example . Each sample had two or more local maxima, which are connected by solid lines. The length of the horizontal bar associated with each point is indicative of the fitting frequency a wider bar indicating a higher frequency . The height of the vertical bar associated with each point is indicative of the relative value of the quality of fit a taller bar indicating a better fit . Sample 1 produced an anomolous result, with the largest maximum off the page for the scale shown. Platey grain fractions p of about .08 and depolarization complements δ of about .05 are representative. Referring to FIG. 7, there is shown a flow diagram of a routine for determining the water filled porosity, In FIG. 7, the block 711 represents the reading in of logged values for ε The block 712 represents the selection of the textural parameters p and δ of the bimodal model that is, the fraction of platey grains, and the unity complement of the platey grain polarization L which depends on the aspect ratio of the platey grains . If available, core measurements and or other information can be used to initially estimate the textural parameters, p and δ, such as from a plot like that of FIG. 6. If not, for a carbonate formation, an initial average value of p .08, δ .05 can be utilized. The block 713 is next entered, this block representing the inputting of fixed values for the dielectric permittivity of the matrix grain material, ε The block 715 represents the solving of the bimodal model relationship 18 for porosity Another quality check that can be performed in accordance with the present embodiment pertains to the invaded zone conductivity, σ FIG. 8 is a flow diagram of a routine for obtaining, as outputs, the water filled porosity, Accordingly, it is seen that in this embodiment there are three unknowns FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of a routine in accordance with a further embodiment of the invention. This embodiment is similar to that of FIG. 7 except that, in this case, the conductivity derived from the EPT device, σ In the FIG. 9 embodiment, it is assumed that salinity of the formation invaded zone water is unknown. However, at a given temperature, it is well known that both the conductivity and the dielectric permittivity of the water can be determined from the water salinity. Accordingly ε w and σ In the FIG. 9 embodiment the blocks 935, 940, 960 and 930 operate, in a manner similar to their counterparts 735, 740, 760 and 730, respectively, in FIG. 7, to compute a reconstructed σ and FIG. 10 illustrates an example of a log of water filled porosity FIG. 11 shows logs of the reconstructed generally invaded zone high frequency conductivity σ FIG. 2 had set forth a simplified pictorial representation of the bimodal model geometry. FIG.s 16 and 17 show further forms of the bimodal model geometry. In FIG. 16, chunks 1610 of the FIG. 2 material i.e. of spherical grains and platey grains of a single aspect ratio, in water, and having the properties described above , which are spheres in this example, are shown as having been added to water. This model has been found to provide an effective representation of sandstones. If the porosity due to the water between the chunks is designated ₁, and the porosity in the chunks is designated ₂, then the total porosity, , is ₁ ₂ 1 ₁ . The complex dielectric permittivity of the composite rock for this chunk model, designated can be represented as where ε ch is the complex dielectric permittivity of the spherical chunk material. Equations can then be developed, and solved, as above, as a function of porosity, electrical parameters, and textural parameters. In FIG. 17 there is shown a model in which spherical cores of matrix material are coated with a mixture of water and platey grains of a single aspect ratio and different sizes. The coated grains 1710 are added to water, as before. The complex dielectric permittivity of each coated grain, designated ε cg , can be represented as where V In the description so far, the simplifying assumption has been made that any hydrocarbon present is treated the same as the rock matrix material, since the conductivity and electric permittivity are in the same general ranges for these materials. As seen, very useful results can be obtained notwithstanding this simplification. Consider, next that a oil water matrix composite is built up in steps by adding infinitesimal amounts of spheres of matrix and oil into an effective host which is the resulting effective medium obtained at the previous step. The change dε in ε of the complex dielectric constant of the mixture at any stage, due to inclusion dv This is similar to equation 6 except that now there is an additional term representing hydrocarbon. In general dv gives Integrating eq. 51 with v where In the d.c. limit equation 54 gives The reason behind the equality n m 3 2 is that it was assumed that both the matrix and hydrocarbon inclusions are spherical. n is the saturation exponent. The results of the oil water matrix with spherical grains is next expanded to include a distribution of spheroidal rock grains and hydrocarbon inclusions i.e., different shapes. Applying the effective medium theory gives The angular brackets denote average over the shape distribution of the α where L where are shape factors depending on the distribution of shaped of matrix grains and hydrocarbon inclusions respectively. Integrating equation 58 with respect to x, and requiring that σ σ It is noted that m merely reflects the average value of the shape factors of the two non conducting phases i.e. hydrocarbon and matrix It is believed that m with m and n as two independent exponents equation 60 has m depending on S Returning to the complex dielectric constant, by integrating Eq. 57 it is found that where, For multi modal distributions one can partially factor the integrand in 61 where P If the matrix is made up of spherical grains having L 1 3, with probability p and plate like grains having L 1 δ, δ 1, with probability 1 p, then equation 62 becomes Next, equation 63 is cast as a sum, as stated above. P In FIG. 18 ε is plotted vs. frequency f ω 2π, and in FIG. 19 a is plotted vs. frequency. The material parameters are those appropriate for a limestone ε As was true for fully water saturated rocks, treated above, a comparison of the hydrocarbon containing cases for the unimodal spherical grains only model and the bimodal spherical grains and platey grains shows that the presence of platey grains can have a large effect on the frequency dispersion of ε and σ. It will be understood from the above that hydrocarbon inclusion can be considered in conjunction with the models hereof. The invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, but variations within the scope of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art. For example, corrections can be implemented to take account of the presence of clays. Further, while specific types of logging tools have been described for the purpose of obtaining measurements of electrical parameters, it will be understood that other types of tools, operating at other frequencies, can be used, consistent with the principles of the invention. Finally, it will be understood that wherever reference is made to conductivity, an appropriate reference to resistivity is implied, and vice versa.
