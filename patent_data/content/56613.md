# Protective enclosures having self contained air supply.

## Abstract
In general terms, a lightweight, flexible protective enclosure 1 or 32 is disclosed to protect a wearer from suffocation due to the presence of smoke or similar noxious fumes that are present in a contaminated environment. In one case, the enclosure 1 has an opened bottom so that the wearer s head and upper body can be received therein. Fastening means 14 are included by which to secure the enclosure 1 around the waist of the wearer and thereby prevent the contaminated environment from entering the enclosure. In a second case, the enclosure 32 has an opened side 40 so that the wearer s head can be received therein. Fastening means 48 are included by which to secure the opened side 40 against the chest of the wearer and thereby prevent the contaminated environment from entering the enclosure. When worn in the contaminated environment, the enclosure 1 or 32 is adapted to provide an air space 25 or 50 of generally conical configuration in which a reserve supply of air is contained and from which the wearer may temporarily breathe to prevent suffocation. Because of its flexible characteristic, the protective enclosure 1 or 32 may be folded into a compact package for convenient storage or distribution.
