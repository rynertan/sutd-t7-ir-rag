## Description
NOVEL PYRINDINES AND THEIR PREPARATION, FORMULATIONS AND USE This invention relates to a novel group of pyrindines. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to the synthesis of drugs, i.e. analgescs, capable of relieving the sensation of pain. Several of the currently available analgesics are limited in their use due to various undesirable side effects which frequently accompany their continued use. Such side effects include addiction and allergy. Illustrative of new analgesic drugs which have recently been discovered are the decahydroisoquinolines, particularly the 4a aryl trans decahyaroisoquinolines which are described in Belgian Patent No. 802,557. The present invention relates to a group of trans 4a aryl 2 substituted octahydro lH2pyrindines. Such compounds are somewhat structurally related to the aforementioned iscquinoline derivatives however, the compounds of formula I below have not heretofore been synthetically available. Simple unsubstituted pyrindine analogs are known in the literature.Volodina et al., for example, prepared certain octahydro 2 pyrindines, none of which were substituted at the 4a position Dokl, Akad. Nauk USSR 173 2 , 342 5 1967 cf. C.A. Vol. 67, 6034 1967 . Similarly,Prochazka et al. prepared a trans octahydro 2 pyrindine lacking a 4a substituent, Coll. Czech. Chem.Commun., 31 9 , 3824 8 1966 , Cf. C.A. Vol. 65, 13651 1966 . Recently, Zimmerman prepared the cis 4aaryl 2 substituted octahydro lH 2 pyrindines which are analgesics and are disclosed in Belgian Patent No.860,314. This invention provides trans 4a phenyl and substituted phenyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydrolH 2 pyrindines not heretofore known or available, and intermediates useful in their preparation. This invention relates to new bicylic compounds characterized as being octahydro lH 2pyrindines, alternatively referred to as hexahydro lH cyclopenta cApyridines. Specifically, the invention provides trans 4a aryl 2 substituted 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindines of the general formulaEMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1 C8 alkyl, CH2R3,EMI2.2 orEMI2.3 in which R3 is C2 C7 alkenyl, C3 C6 cycloalkyl, furyl, or tetrahydrofuryl R4 and R5 independently are hydrogen,C1 C3 alkyl, or halogen n is 0, 1, 2, or 3 m is 0 or 1, except that when m is 0, n is other than 0 X isCO, CHOH, CH CH, S, or 0, except that when n is O, X is other than S or O R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy, C1 C3 alkoxy, or r C1 C3 alkanoyloxy and the non toxic pharma ceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Additionally encompossed within the scope of formula I are intermediate compounds having the above formula wherein R1 isEMI3.1 in which Rn has the above defined meaning,EMI3.2 in which n, m, X, R4 and R5 have the above defined meaning. A preferred group of compounds of formula I wherein R1 is C1 C8 alkyl or CH2R3 in which R3 isC2 C7 alkenyl or C3 C6 cycloalkyl. A more preferred group of compounds within this latter preferred group are those of formula I wherein R2 is hydroxy methoxy.An especially preferred group of intermediate compounds are those of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen. The process for preparing the transcompounds of the general formulaEMI3.3 wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1 C8 alkyl, CH2R3, orEMI4.1 in which R3 is C2 C7 alkenyl, C3 C6 cycloalkyl, furyl, or tetrahydrofuryl R4 and R5 independently are hydrogen, C1 C3 alkyl, or halogen n is 0, 1, 2, or 3 m is 0 or 1, except that when m is 0, n is other than 0 X is CO, CHOH, CH CH, S, or 0, except that when n is 0, X is other than S or 0 R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy, C1 C3 alkoxy, orC1 C3 alkanoyloxy and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof which comprises reacting a compound of the general formulaEMI4.2 wherein R1 is hydrogen, C1 C8 alkyl, CH2R3, EMI4.3 or EMI5.1 in which R3 is C3 C6 cycloallsyl, furyl, or tetrahydrofuryl R4 and R5 independently are hydrogen, C1 C3 alkyl, or halogen n is 0, 1, 2, or 3 m is 0 or 1, except that when m is 0, n is other than 0 X is CO, CHOH, CH CH, S, or 0, except that when n is 0, X is other than S or 0 R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy, C1 C3 alkoxy, or C1 C3 alkanoyloxy with hydrogen and platinium oxide, followed by alkylation when R1 is hydrogen to obtain a compound of formula II in which Rj is defined as before, optionally de etherifying when R2 is C1 C3 alkoxy to obtain a compound of formula II in which R2 is hydroxy, and optionally acylating a compound of formula II in which R2 is hydroxy to obtain a compound of formula II in which R2 is C1 C3 alkanoyloxy, and, when desired, forming the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof by conventional means. As used throughout the present specification and in the appended claims, the term C1 C8 alkyl refers to both straight and branched chains of eight carbon atoms or less. Examples of typical C1 C8 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, pentyl, 3 methylpentyl, 1,2 dimethylpentyl, 2 methylbutyl, 3 ethylpentyl, noctyl, 2 methylheptyl, isoheptyl, 3 ethylhexyl, 1,3,3 trimethylpentyl, and related groups. The term CH2R3, in which R3 is C2 C7 alkenyl refers to both straight and branched alkenyl groups having eight or less carbon atoms, including groups such as allyl, 3 butenyl, 2 pentenyl, 3pentenyl, 2 methyl 2 butenyl, 3 methyl 3 pentenyl, 3 isohexenyl, 2 ethyl 3 butenyl, 4 hexenyl, 3methyl 2 pentenyl, 3 octenyl, 2 isooctenyl, 2isopropyl 3 butenyl, 2,3 dimethyl 2 butenyl, 5heptenyl, 6 octenyl, 2 methyl 3 heptenyl, and related alkenyl groups. Additionally included within the definition of R1 in formula I is the group represented by CH2R3 in which R3 is C3 C6 cycloalkyl. Such groups include cyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutylmethyl, cyclopentylmethyl and cyclohexylmethyl. R1 can also represent groups such as 2 tetrahydrofurylmethyl, 3 tetrahydrofurylmethyl, and 3 furylmethyl. In formula I , R1 can also be a group of the formulaEMI6.1 in which n is 0, 1, 2, or 3, m is 0 or 1, except that when m is 0, n is other than 0 X is CO, CHOH, CH CH, S or 0, except that when n is O, X is other than S or 0 and R4 and R5 independently are hydrogen, C1 C3 alkyl, or halogen. In such formula, the term C1 C3 alkyl includes methyl, ethyl and propyl. Halogen refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.Examples of typical R1 groups represented by this partial formula include benzyl, 2 phenylethyl, 3 phenylpropyl, 3 methylbenzyl, 4 chlorobenzyl, 2,4 dibromobenzyl, 2 2 methyl 5ethylphenyl ethyl, 3 4 isopropylphenyl propyl, benzoylmethyl, benzoylethyl, 4 iodobenzoylmethyl, 2 methyl 4 chlorobenzoylmethyl, 2 phenyl 2 hydroxyethyl, 3 phenyl 3 hydroxypropyl, 2 4 fluorophenyl 2 hydroxyethyl, phenoxymethyl, 3,5 diethylphenoxymethyl, 3 phenylthiopropyl, 2 methylphenylthiomethyl, 3,5 dichlorophenylthiomethyl, 3 chloro 5 bromophenylthiomethyl, and related groups. When R1 in formula I is hydrogen, the unsubstituted 2 position can be further reacted by acylation and reduction either when the n1,7a bond is reduced or separately with Zn acetic acid or catalytic hydrogenation , or alkylation particularly to obtain the group where R1 is CH2R3 in which R3 is C2 C7 alkenyl . Compounds of formula I as indicated by formula 11 1 which are thus readily provided by reducing the A1 a bond of a 4a aryl 2 substituted 3,4,4a,5,6,7 hexahydro 2 pyrindine of formula III according to the above described procedures include, among others 4a phenyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a 3 methoxyphenyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a 3 ethoxyphenyl 2 methyl 2,3,4,4a,5, 6,7, 7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a phenyl 2 ethyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a 3 isopropoxyphenyl 2 benzyl 2,3,4, 4a, 5,6,7, 7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a phenyl 2 isobutyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro 1H 2 pyrindine 4a 3 methoxyphenyl 2 4 ethylhexyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine and 4a 3 ethoxyphenyl 2 3 chlorobenzyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine. As was hereinbefore noted, very important intermediates for preparing all of the pyrindine derivatives of formula I are the 2 unsubstituted pyrindine derivatives, those in which R1 in formula 11 is hydrogen. Such compounds can be readily alkylated or acylated at the 2 position to provide pharmacologically active octahydropyrindines of formula I , or in the case of the N acylated derivatives, to provide intermediates which are easily converted to the active analgesics of formula I .It is therefore often desirable to prepare, according to the above described processes, 4a aryl 2 substi tuted 2, 3,4,4a, 5,6,7, 7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindines in which the 2 substituent is readily removable so as to provide the corresponding 2 unsubstituted octahydropyrindine derivatives. The N methyl and N benzyl groups are readily cleavable to afford the corresponding 2 unsubstituted pyrindine derivative. The 2 methyl pyrindine derivatives can be reacted with a haloformate ester such as phenyl chloroformate or ethyl chloroformate to afford the corresponding carbamate at the pyrindine 2 position. Such carbamate is then reacted with an aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide to effect cleavage of the 2 carbamate moiety and thus provide the corresponding 2 unsubstituted pyrindine derivative.Such method for the cleavage of an N methyl group is that of Abel Monen and Portoghese as described in J. Med. Chem., 15, 208 1972 . Similarly, the aforementioned 4a aryl 2 benzyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindines are readily converted to the corresponding 2 unsubstituted pyrindine derivative by simple debenzylation. Such debenzylation may be achieved by catalytic hydrogention, utilizing for instance a catalyst such as five percent palladium suspended on carbon. Such debenzylation reactions are quite general for preparing secondary amines and are described in detail by Hartung andSimonoff, Org. Reactions, 7, 277 1953 , and by Loenard and Fuji, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 85, 3719 1963 . As can readily be seen from the foregoing discussion, the following representative 2 unsubstituted pyrindine derivatives, formula II whereR1 is hydrogen, are also important intermediates for the preparation of the pyrindines of formula I . 4a phenyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a 3 methoxyphenyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a 3 ethoxyphenyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7aoctahydro lH 2 pyrindine and 4a 3 isopropoxyphenyl 2, 3,4, 4a, 5,6,7, 7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine. The 4a aryl 2 unsubstituted 2,3,4,4a,5, 6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindines thus prepared can be alkylated by normal procedures to provide pharmacologically active 2 substituted pyrindine derivatives, or can be acylated to provide intermediates which are readily converted to active analgesic drugs. For example, a 4a aryl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine can be alkylated at the 2 position by reaction with essentially any reactive derivative of an alkyl group. Such alkylating agents are compounds of the formula R1 Z in which R1 is as defined hereinabove and Z is any of a number of groups commonly referred to as good leaving groups.Groups most commonly known as good leaving groups include the halogens, particularly chlorine, bromine and iodine, para toluenesulfonyl tosyl , phenylsulfonyl, methanesulfonyl mesyl , para bromophenylsulfonyl brosyl , and azido. It will be noted that when reference is made herein to an alkylating agent having the formulaR1 Z, it is intended that the alkyl portion of such alkylating agent can be derivatized, for instance by unsaturated substituents, aryl substituents, and cycloalkyl substituents. The term alkylating agent having the formula R1 Z thus includes compounds such as methyl chloride, ethyl bromide, 5 methylheptyltosylate, allyl bromide, 4 hexenyl iodide, 3 ethyl 4 pentenyl brosylate, cyclopropylmethyl chloride, cyclobutylmethyl iodide, cyclohexylmethyl mesylate, 3 tetrahydrofurylmethyl bromide, 2 furylmethyl azide, 2phenylethyl chloride, 3 benzoylpropyl bromide, 2 3 chlorophenylthio ethyl azide, phenoxymethyl bromide, 3 isopropylphenylthiomethyl bromide, and related groups. Thus, a 4a aryl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octa hydro 1H 2 pyrindine can be reacted with an alkylating agent to provide the corresponding 4a aryl 2 substituted 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine. Such alkylation reaction is quite general and can be accomplished by reacting the appropriate 4a aryl octahydro lH 2 pyrindine with the appropriate alkylating agent, preferably in an unreactive organic solvent. The alkylating agent typically is utilized in excess amounts, for instance from about 0.5 to about 2.0 molar excess relative to the pyrindine derivative. Unreactive organic solvents commonly utilized in the reaction include ethers such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, as well as solvents such as benzene, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, nitromethane, and hexamethylphosphortriamide.A base is preferably incorporated in the alkylation reaction to act as an acid scavenger since the reaction of the pyrindine derivative and the alkylating agent generally is accompanied by the formation of an acid such as hydrochloric acid or para toluenesulfonic acid which may act to tie up any unreacted 2 pyrindine derivative as a salt. Bases commonly utilized as acid scavengers in such reaction include sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, triethylamine, and pyridine. Typically, about one equivalent amount of base is employed however, excessive amounts can be incorporated if desired.The alkylation reaction normally is carried out at an elevated temperature ranging from about 500C. to 2000C., and at such temperature, the reaction normally is substantially complete within about 1 to 10 hours however, longer reaction times are not detrimental and can be used if desired. The product typically is recovered by simply adding water to the reaction mixture and then extracting the product therefrom into a waterimmiscible organic solvent such as benzene, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, chloroform, or related solvents. Upon removal of the solvent from such extracts, for instance by evaporation under reduced pressure, there is obtained the product 4a aryl 2 substituted 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine, which compound exists either as an oil or as a solid at room temperature.The product so formed can be further purified if desired by standard procedures including chromatography, crystallization, distillation, or alternatively such pyrindine product can be converted to an acid addition salt by reaction with an inorganic or organic acid. Such salts routinely are highly crystalline solids and are readily recrystallized to provide a solid salt of high purity. If desired such salt can then be treated with a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium carbonate, thereby cleaving the salt to provide the purified 4a aryl 2 substituted 2,3,4,4a, 5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine as a free base. As herebefore indicated, the 2 unsubstituted pyrindine derivatives, namely the 4a aryl octahydrolH 2 pyrindines, can be converted to a 2 substituted pyrindine derivative which is either a pharmacologically useful agent per se, or one which can be readily converted to a pharmacologically useful agent. For example, reaction of a 4a aryl 2,3,4,4a, 5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine with an alkylating agent such as 2 benzoylethyl iodide provides the corresponding 4a aryl 2 2 benzoylethyl 2,3,4,4a, 5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine, an active analgesic.If desired, such compound can be reduced at the benzoyl carbonyl moiety, for instance by reaction with a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride, to afford the corresponding 4a aryl 2 3 hydroxy 3 phenyl propyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine, also a useful analgesic agent. Additionally, a 2 unsubstituted pyrindine derivative can be acylated with any of a number of acylating agents to provide an N acylated pyrindine derivative, a compound of formula I wherein R1 isEMI13.1 Such N acylated pyrindines, upon reduction of the carbonyl moiety, provide 2 substituted pyrindine derivatives of formula I which are active analgesics.Examples of commonly used acylating agents include acetyl chloride, pentanoylchloride, 4 hexenoyl chloride, cyclobutylformyl bromide, 2 tetrahydro furyl formyl chloride, benzoyl bromide, phenoxyacetyl iodide, 3,4 dimethylphenylacetyl chloride, 3 2fluorophenyl propionyl chloride, phenylthioacetyl bromide, 4 phenyl 3 butenoyl chloride, acetic anhydride, and hexanoic anhydride. The acylation of the 2unsubstituted pyrindine derivative with an acylating agent such as the aforementioned is carried out by reacting approximately equimolar quantities of the pyrindine derivative and the acylating agent in an unreactive organic solvent such as dichloromethane, ethanol, or tetrahydrofuran. The reaction typically utilizes a base such as sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, or propylene oxide to serve as an acid scavenger.The reaction is best carried out at a temperature of about 200C. to about 300C., and generally is complete within 1 to 8 hours. The product, for example a 4a aryl 2 acylated 2,3,4,4a, 5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine, is readily isolated by simply removing the reaction solvent by evaporation.The product so formed normally is not purified further, but rather is reduced immediately to provide a 4a aryl 2 substituted 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine of formula I . Such reduction of the N acyl carbonyl group can be accomplished by reaction of the acylated pyrindine derivative with a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride or by catalytic hydrogenation or upon reduction of the Al 7a bond with platinium oxide and hydrogen. It will additionally be recognized that still other modifications can be made on certain of the 4a aryl 2 substituted 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octa hydro lH 2 pyrindines of formula I . For example, while a 4a aryl pyrindine derivative wherein the aryl croup is a 3 hydroxyphenyl moiety can be prepared by starting with a 2 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 ethoxycarbonyl ..ethyl cyclonexar.one and modifying such compound according to the various processes discussed hereinabove, it might be preferable to prepare a 4a 3 methoxyphenyl 2 substituted 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine, and then convert the 3 methoxy group of such 4a aryl substituent to a hydroxy group.Such conversion is readily accomplished by reacting a 4a 3 methoxyphenyl pyrindine derivative with hydrobromic acid in acetic acid. Such reaction is quite general for the conversion of a methoxyphenyl group to a hydroxyphenyl group. The hydroxy group of such 4a 3 hydroxyphenyl pyrindines can, if desired, be acylated with common C1 C3 alkanoyl acylating agents, for instance acetyl chloride or propionyl anhydride, thereby providing the corresponding 4a 3 alkanoyloxyphenyl pyrindine derivatives. As hereinbefore pointed out, the 4a aryl2 substituted octahydro lH 2 pyrindine derivatives of formula I can be reacted with an organic or inorganic acid so as to provide a crystalline salt which can be purified by crystallization, and which then can be converted back to the pyrindine free base by treatment with a suitable base such as sodium hydroxide. Certain of the acid addition salts are encompassed within the scope of formula I .Specifically, there are included herein the nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the pyrindine bases which are described hereinabove. Such non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are prepared by reacting a a aryl 2 substituted octahydro lH 2 pyrindine of formula I with an organic or an inorganic acid.Acids commonly used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of formula I include the hydrogen halide acids such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, and hydrogen iodide, as well as acids such as sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, perchloric, phosphorous, nitrous, and related acids. Organic acids commonly used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the pyrindines of formula I include acetic, propionic, para toluenesulfonic, chloroacetic, maleic, tartaric, succinic, oxalic, citric, lactic, palmitic, stearic, benzoic, and related acids.The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of formula I can be conveniently prepared by simply dissolving a 4a aryl 2 substitutedoctahydro lH 2 pyrindine in a suitable solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetone, or ethanol, and adding to such solution either an equivalent amount or an excess of a suitable acid. The salt so formed normally crystallizes out of solution and can be recovered by filtration, and is accordingly ready for use as a pharmacological agent, or can be further purified by recrystallization from common solvents such as acetone and methanol. The following list of trans 4a aryl 2 substituted 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindines is representative of the compounds falling within the scope of formula 1 . 4a phenyl 2 3 ethylpentyl 2,3,4,4a,5, 6,7,7a octahydro 1H 2 pyrindine 4a 3 methoxyphenyl 2 n octyl 2,3,4,4a, 5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindinium bromide 4a 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 2 propenyl 2,3,4, 4a, 5,6,7, 7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a 3 propoxyphenyl 2 2,3 dimethyl4 hexenyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro 1H 2 pyrindine 4a phenyl 2 5 heptenyl 2, 3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindinium acetate 4a 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 cyclopentylmethyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro 1H 2 pyrindinium oxalate 4a 3 ethoxyphenyl 2 2 tetrahydrofuryl methyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a phenyl 2 2 phenoxyethyl 2,3,4,4a,5, 6,7, 7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 2 methylphenoxy methyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindinium succinate 4a 3 methoxyphenyl 2 3, 5 dichlorobenzoyl methyl 2,3,4, 4a, 5,6,7, 7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a 3 ethoxyphenyl 2 3 3 methyl 4bromophenyl 3 hydroxy propyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7aoctahydro lH 2 pyrindinium iodide 4a phenyl 2 3 2 ethyl 6 methylphenylthio propyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro 1H 2 pyrindinium perchlorate 4a 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 2 3,4 dibromo phenyl 2 hydroxy ethyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a phenyl 2 3 phenylthio propyl 2,3,4, 4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro 1H 2 pyridinium citrate 4a phenyl 2 3 2 isopropylphenyl propyl2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro 1H 2 pyrindinium maleate 4a 3 ethoxyphenyl 2 2 phenyl 2 hydroxy ethyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro 1H 2 pyrindinium phosphate 4a phenyl 2 2 4 chlorophenyl 2 hydroxy ethyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro 1H 2 pyrindinium methanesulfonate 4a 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 3 2 chloro 3 bromophenyl 3 hydroxypropyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7aoctahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a 3 propoxyphenyl 2 2 ethylbenzoylethyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro 1H 2 pyrindinium chloride 4a 3 ethoxyphenyl 2 3 2 chlorophenyl thio propyl 2,3,4, 4a, 5,6,7, 7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine 4a phenyl 2 3 2 ethyl 5 bromophenyl propyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindine and 4a 3 hydroxyphenyl 2 2 3, 5 diethyl phenoxy ethyl 2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindinium stearate. It will be noted that the compounds of formula I have two asymmetric centers, namely the 4a position and the 7a position. This invention comprehends both separated isomers and racemic mixtures of such isomers which are useful pharmacologically as analgesic agonist or antogonist drugs. However, only the trans isomers of formula I are intended thereby, namely, such that the 4a aryl group is oriented on the opposite side of the plane of the molecule from the 7a hydrogen atom. This invention accordingly comprehends the pharmacologically active individual optically active trans isomers, in addition to the racemic mixture of trans isomers.Such racemic pair of trans octahydropyrindines can be separated into its component stereoisomers by procedures well known in the art. In the event that all useful pharmacologic activity resides in one sterioisomer, the dl racemate is still useful in that it contains, as a constituent part, the pharmacologically active isomer. The process for preparing the 4a,7a trans isomers, formula II , comprises catalytic hydrogenation of a 4a aryl hexahydropyrindine, formula III , specifically a pyrindine having a double bond at the l,7a position. Such hydrogenation generally is carried out by reacting a 4a aryl 2 alkyl 3,4,4a, 5,6,7 hexahydro 2 pyrindine with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum oxide. The hydrogenation typically is carried out in a solvent such as methanol or ethanol, and routinely is complete within about one to eight hours when carried out at about 250C. under a hydrogen pressure of about 2.74 x 106 to about 5.48 x 106 dynes cm2. The hydrogenation typically provides a mixture of the l,7atrans isomer and the 1,7a cis isomer however, the trans isomer generally predominates.Separation of the isomers can be readily effected by salt formation and crystallization. For example the racemic mixture of octahydropyrindines can be converted to a suitable salt such as the pirate or maleate salt, and the cis racemate normally crystallizes first from solvents such as diethyl ether and diisopropyl ether, and can accordingly be separated from the trans by filtration.The trans racemate then can be recovered from the filtrate and purified by recrystallization. The preparation of the 4a aryl octahydropyrindines provided by formula I requires starting materials, many of which are hitherto unknown and not readily available. For example, the above described preferred method for preparing trans 4a aryl 2substituted octahydro lH 2 pyrindines requires the corresponding 4a aryl 2 substituted 3,4,4a,5,6,7hexahydro 2 pyrindines, i.e. A1t7a hexahydropyrindines. Such compounds can be prepared by condensing phenyl lithium or a 3 substituted phenyl lithium with a l alkyl 4 piperidone to provide the corresponding 1 alkyl 4 phenyl or substituted phenyl 4 hydroxypiperidine. Dehydration of the 4 hydroxypiperidine derivative affords a l alkyl 4 aryl 1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine. The tetrahydropyridine derivative next is reacted with a propylene dihalide such as 3chloropropylbromide to afford a l alkyl 4 aryl 4 3 halopropyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydropyridine, which is then readily cyclized by reaction with sodium iodide in acetonitrile to provide the corresponding 4a aryl2 alkyl 3,4,4a,5,6,7 hexahydro 1H 2 pyrindine. Certain of the 4a aryl 2 substituted octaAydro lH 2 pyrindines of formula I have found utility in the treatment of pain, and accordingly can be used to effect analgesia in a subject suffering from pain and in need of. treatment. Additionally, the pyrindine derivatives of formula I have been found to possess both analgesic agonist and analgesic antagonist properties, and as such are capable of producing analgesia in a mammal while at the same time, because of the analgesic antagonist activity, having a greatly decreased incidence of addiction liability. Such ability of the compounds disclosed herein to cause analgesic agonist as well as analgesic antagonist effects in mammals is thus responsible for a decrease in any addictive properties of a particular drug caused by its opiate like analgesic action.The compounds are thus particularly valuable since they produce analgesia with only minimal physical dependance liability. Certain of the compounds are additionally useful in combating the undesirable effects produced by opiates such as morphine. The analgesic activity possessed by the compounds of formula I has been determined by testing such compounds in standard animal assays routinely used to measure analgesic action attributable to test compounds. Such assays include the mouse writhing test and the rat tail jerk assay. The mouse writhing assay is carried out as follows Cox standard strain albino male mice, weighing 20 22 grams and fasted overnight, are used.Writhing, which is characterized by contraction of the abdominal musculature, extension of the hindlegs and rotation of the trunk is induced by the intraperitoneal administration of 55 mg kg of acetic acid 0.55 percent . Each treatment group consists of 5 mice. The total number of writhes for the treatment group is determined in a 10 minute observation period starting 5 minutes after acetic acid administration. Control groups have totals of 200 350 writhes per observation period.Control and experimental groups are compared and a percent inhibitionEMI22.1 tb calculated SEP as SEP follows tb SEP SEP Inhibition SEP SEP 100 SEP SEP SEP Experimental SEP total SEP SEP x SEP 100 tb SEP Control SEP total tb Test compounds are administered at 100 mg kg by the oral route at 30, 90, and 180 minutes and by the subcutaneous route at 30 minutes before the intraperitoneal administration of acetic acid. A second standard assay for analgesic activity is the rat tail jerk assay which is carried out as follows Female Sprague Dawley rats weighing 70 80 grams that have been fasted overnight are used.Following treatment with either the administration vehicle or the test compound, the animal is placed in a plexiglass holder. A nichrome resistance wire is located between two V shaped copper tubes that serve as a tail rest. The tail of the rat is placed in the tail rest and the nichrome wire is heated by passing electric AC current through it.Radiant heat from the wire becomes aversive to a normal rat within 6 7 seconds and the rat attempts to jerk away from the heat. The elapsed time from the onset of the current in the wire to body jerk of the rat is recorded as the tail jerk reaction time. The average tail jerk reaction time of a drug treated group is compared to the average reaction time of a vehicle treated control group usingStudent s t test for statistical significance.These are usually 5 animals per treatment group.The mean reaction time S.E. of a typical control group is 6.85 0.3 seconds. In the mouse writhing assay, the following E.D.50 ,s dose mg kg which decreases the number of writhing observations by 50 percent 30 minutes after administration compared to controls were obtained for the compounds of formula I and are shown inTable I. Also, in the rat tail jerk assay, the following E.D. s effective dose mg kg which causes a 2 second increase in reaction time determined after 30 minutes were obtained for the compounds of formula I and are also shown in Table I.

The 4a aryl 2 substituted 2,3,4,4a,5,6, 7,7a octahydro lH 2 pyrindines of formula I are thus useful in producing analgesia in mammals such as humans. Such compounds can be administered to a mammal by either the oral or the parenteral route.It generally is preferred to utilize a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of the pyrindine derivative when the dosage is by the oral route, since such salts are easily formulated for convenient oral administration. For example, one or more pharmacologically active compounds of formula I either as the free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, will be formulated for oral administration by admixing such compounds with any of a number of commonly used diluents, excipients, or carriers. Examples of such diluents and excipients commonly employed in pharmaceutical preparations include starch powder, sucrose, cellulose, magnesium stearate, lactose, calcium sulfate, sodium benzoate and related diluents. Such compositions can be molded into tablets or enclosed in telescoping gelatin capsules for convenient administration.If desired, the active compounds of formula I can additionally be combined with one or more other agents known to effect analgesia, such as caffeine, acetaminophen, and propoxyphene. The active compounds of formula I can additionally be formulated as sterile aqueous or non aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions for convenient parenteral administration. Non aqueous vehicles commonly utilized in such formulations include propylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, as well as various organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Useful aqueous solutions for oral and parenteral administration include isotonic saline solution. The precise dosage o active ingredient, that is the amount of one or more of the pharmacologically active 4a aryl 2 substituted octahydrolH 2 pyrindines of formula I administered to a mammal, such as a human subject for example, may be varied over a relatively wide range, it being necessary that the formulations should constitute a proportion of one or more of the active ingredients of formula I such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Such suitable dosage will depend on the particular therapeutic effect desired, on the particular route of administration being utilized, and on the duration of treatment, as well as the precise condition being treated.Typically the dosages of the active compounds of formula I will range from about 1.0 to about 25 mg. kg. of animal body weight per day, appropriately divided for administration from 1 to 4 times per day. Preferred oral dosages will generally range from about 2 to about 50 mg. kg. In order to demonstrate more fully the scope of the compounds of formula I and their starting materials, the following examples are provided by way of illustration.
