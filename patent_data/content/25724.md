# Method of making measurements on an object by means of a movable probe.

## Abstract
Method of making measurements on an object by means of a movable probe with an apparatus having said movable probe 110 and a pair of storage members 120, 130 , this method allowing to maintain simultaneously infor mation regarding the present position of the probe 110 and a position of said probe 110 at a past time. According to this method the present position information of the probe 110 is stored in one of the storage members 120, 130 and this present probe position information is transferred to the other storage member 130 in response to a control signal indicating contact with the object 200 . In this manner, said one storage member 120 continue to maintain the present position information of the probe 110 which may be mov ing, while an output device 140 which is coupled to the other storage member 130 is not affected by the change in said one storage member 120 . This method has applica tion to multi dimension measuring and single dimension measuring.
