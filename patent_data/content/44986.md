# Multi track recording head assembly with electromagnetic cross talk neutralization.

## Abstract
A high track density recording head assembly which eliminates cross talk in high track density recording sys tems by positioning very thin neutralization heads 26, 28 between each pair of adjacent recording heads 22, 24 . The neutralization heads 26, 28 are provided with air gaps aligned with the gaps in the adjacent heads and have coils 34, 36 wound to develop a polarity opposite to that in the adjacent recording head 22, 24 . The neutralization head flux thus produced cancels the recording head lateral fringing flux that is responsible for recording interference in the adjacent recording tracks.
