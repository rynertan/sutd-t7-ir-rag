## Description
Anti Androgenic Preparation for Oral Cavity AdministrationField of the Invention This invention relates to a pharmaceutical preparation containing a 16ss ethyl 17ss hydroxy estrane derivative, anti androgenically active compound, for administration in oral cavity and a method of preparation thereof.Description of Prior Arts 16ss ethyl 17ss hydroxy estrane derivatives employed in this invention are represented in the following formula,EMI1.1 wherein a dotted line at 10 position indicates a saturated bond or an unsaturated double bond, and A stands for a hydrogen atom, an ether residue, or an ester residue. USPatent 3856829 and European Patent Application 44495 .The compounds belonging to the formula I will be often described as estrane I in the following. Among them, 16ss ethyl 17ss hydroxy 4 estren 3 one, code number TSAA291 commonly called oxendolone is known as to be effective to remedy prostalomegaly and has been commercially employed in trade name Prostetin . However, because of its poor solubility in water, Prostetin has been pharmaceutically prepared in the form of an aqueous suspension for injecting into gluteal muscle of a patient. This administration method of injection brings a good absorption in vivo, but entails severe lasting pain around the injection site and needs a treatment by a professional practitioner because the administration method is injection.Consequently, there has been desired the development of other administration, ready to self medication. Summary of the Invention An object of this invention is to provide a pharmaceutical preparation of estrane I for efficient administration other than injection. Other objects of this invention will be apparent in the following descriptions. In accordance with this invention, these objects are attained by formulating estrane I into a preparation so that an administration unit may resist for a period longer than 30 minutes in a disintegration test defined below and by placing said prepared administration unit in oral cavity, in particular, in the upper gingival cavity so that estrane I may be absorbed through oral.mucous membrane of the site.Detailed Description of the Invention Extensive studies by inventors of this invention, in search of possible administration other than injection, e.g., routine oral route, rectum suppository, through oral cavity membrane, have firstly proved that bioavailability through the oral cavity membrane is greater and superior in terms of scarce fluctuation due to variation in estrane I , and this administration is easy to self medication, further is appropriate for industrial preparation with high efficiency. Secondly, the research on dependency of absorption in vivo upon retention time of a medicament in oral cavity has revealed that absorption is insufficient with a medicament having the retention time of less than 30 minutes. These observations above have led the particular disintegration test as described below to be a factor to define the present invention. A test sample a prepared administration unit is adhesively bonded on an internal surface of an auxiliary tube of small cylindrical shape made of transparent plastic, and the sample bonded tube is put on the round bottom of a cylindrical vessel made of transparent plastic with a capacity of 1000 mQ water.In operation, water in the vessel is warmed and kept at 37 0.50C. Then an agitator, inverse T shaped paddle type, is set to agitate the water 100 rpm , keeping some clearance above said sample loaded tube put on the bottom thereof.A disintegration time is measured at the temperature set as above by visual observation to determine how long a test sample resists in the warm water before its disintegration. Detail of the apparatus is as follows. a Vessel Said vessel, made of transparent plastic, is of 1000 mQ cylinder with round bottom, 160 175 mm in height and 50 52.5 mm in radius. The upper mouth thereof defines a peripheral flat flange to hold a lid. Said lid, transparent and circular with 140 mm diameter and 4 mm thick, has a groove like break extending with 12 mm wide from its periphery to the center defining a hole with 16 mm diameter. b Agitator The journal portion of the shaft has 6.0 10.5 mm in diameter and the portion for water submerging has 9.5 10.5 mm in diameter and 370 400 mm long in total. The paddle, mounted at the shaft bottom edge, is geometrically shaped from a circular plate having 83 mm in diameter and 3.0 5.0 mm thick, by two different parallel chords, a chord of 75 1 mm and of 42 1 mm. The intermediate portion between the above two parallel chords defines the dimension of said paddle and is mounted with the 42 mm chord being down side and through the shaft center. c Auxiliary Tube A transparent plastic made tube, 17 mm outer and 12 mm inner diameter and 20 mm long, is tipped with screw thread on both outer ends. Two short tubes with the same diameter dimensions and 2.5 mm long are likewise tipped with screw thread on either inner end to be couplable with the 20 mm tube ends. And two acid resistant nets, 0.29 mm wire and 0.42 mm opening, are tightly closed with screws at the both end mouths of the 20 mm tube. The equipment a , b and c above are based on the disintegration test and the dissolution test adopted in the Pharmaceutical Standards in Japan which is disclosed in the Pharmacopeia of Japan, 10th edition. And it is proved that a distintegration time observed above is comparable with time for a sample medicament unit to remain in oral cavity of an animal or human. Referring to embodied compounds of estrane I ,A at 17 position may be, in addition to be a hydrogen atom, an acyl radical, e.g., acetyl, propionyl, valeryl, isobutylyl, hexanoyl, heptanoyl, chloroacetyl, enanthyoyl, capryoyl, lauroyl, stearoyl, phenoxyacetyl and benzoyl or an alkyl, or an ether alkyl, e.g., methyl, ethyl, methoxymethyl, methoxyethyl, ethoxyethyl, propyl, butyl, benzyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrofuryl and tetrahydrothienyl further, acyl or alkyl radicals above may be other straight, branched, saturated or unsaturated ones than specified above. Referring to specifications for pharmaceutical preparation in this invention, an administration form may be tablet, pill, or suppository, so far as a prepared administration unit is provided with sufficiently long disintegration time as defined. The preparation is carried out by use of conventional procedures and formulating materials including release controller, vehicle, binder, lubricant, adsorber, and corrigent etc.as known conventionally. Examples of release controller are cellulose derivatives, e.g. hydroxyethyl , hydroxypropyl , hydroxypropylmethyl , carboxymethyl cellulose gelatin, arabic gum, amylopectin starch. A preparation comprising 20 60 of the estrane I , 7 30 of the release controller and other appropriate formulating materials, tabletted under 1300 2000 Kg cmÃª pressure into a size with 6 12 mm in diameter and 0.5 2.5 mm thick, may provide an adequate disintegration time of from 30 minutes to 10 hours.The requirement for disintegration time of from 30 min. to 10 hrs., preferably from 60 min. to 6 hrs., is attained chiefly by choice of release controller and determination of its formulation ratio. Percentages above and hereinafter are by weight. Examples of vehicle are corn starch, wheat starch, potato starch and other starch sugars, e.g. sucrose, lactose inorganic vehicles, e.g. calcium sulfate, calcium phosphate, sodium chloride, precipitated calcium carbonate. As for binder, sugars, starch, dextrin, arabic gum, tragacanth gum, sodium alginate, gelatin, gluten, and other natural binders methyl , ethyl , hydroxyethyl , hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and other cellulose derivatives polyvinyl pyrrolidone, alcohol, acetate, macrogol, and other synthetic macromolecular binders are available, and organic macromolecular vehicles or binders are preferable to this invention because they are capable of controlling disintegration of a preparation in aqueous surroundings which is brought about in the test procedure. Examples of lubricant are magnesium stearate, talc, synthetic aluminum silicate, ultra fine silicone oxide, higher aliphatic acid, higher alcohol, macrogol, hydrogen saturated vegetable oil, silicone oil, polyoxyethylene glycol aliphatic acid ester and paraffin.Adsorbents are, for example, ultra fine silicone oxide and active carbon. Corrigents are, for example, natural sweetner sucrose, glucose, fructose, sorbitol artificial sweetner saccharine. Organic acids for example, citric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid. Flavor chemical for example, Q menthol. Referring further to administration in oral cavity, any site therein, e.g. sublingual cavity, cavity between gingiva and cheek interior, cavity between gingiva and lip interior is allowable. However, conventional troches, sublingual tablets, when put in oral cavity, arouse foreign feel to patients and medicines above are soon chewed or swallowed before they stay for 30 min. or so in the mouth.Actually our experience has concluded that the best is to place an administration unit in the cavity between upper gingiva and upper lip interior. Also it is proved that this best site produces scarce foreign feel and no additional adhesive is necessary to hold and that a preparation placed there may stay so stably that a patient can even take a meal in the meantime. As for size and shape of administration unit, no restriction is provided with this invention and a sensory test in the form of tablet shows that a tablet having a size from 6 to 12 mm in diameter and from 0.5 to 2.5 mm in thickness will not trouble an adult in taking meal while he holds a tablet in his upper gingival cavity where the tablet will encounter with so less secreted mouth fluid. Accordingly, sufficient retention time until disappearance is attained on oral mucous membrane. The best preparation experienced in this invention is in the form of tablet with the shape above, which comprises 15 20 of hydroxypropyl or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, and 0.1 10 of natural sweetner e.g. glycyrrhizin and other materials, e.g. disintegration promoter, if necessary. Up to now, a few reports have disclosed the administration of medicament at the same cavity spot for instance, Abridgments of reports at 102nd annual convention of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan, 1982, page 601, 3W, 4 5 . But all these disclosures intend the remedy for local treatment on oral cavity area, instead of general treatment like this invention, and pharmaceutical entity disclosed therein is considered to be effective through gastrointestine absorption, instead of through oral membrane. In contrast, the uniqueness of our invention resides in administration in oral cavity for absorption through oral membrane with intention of general treatment.Embodiments of the Invention It is to be understood that embodiments of this invention described in the following are for illustration thereof and should not be construed to limit this invention.Experiment 1 Six different preparations A through F containing TSAA 291 were manufactured to exhibit various disintegration times according to the test method as described above. And these preparations were administered to beagle dogs at a dose of 50 mg dog of TSAA 291, placing an administration unit in their upper gingival cavity and periodically their blood was collected and blood concentrations thereof were measured to estimate the area under curve AUC .

CMC is calcium carboxy methyl cellulose.3. HPC is hydroxy propyl cellulose. Formulations for the preparations A to F were varied chiefly with respect to the content of the release controller hydroxy propyl cellulose . The Table 1 apparently indicates good agreement between disintegration time as measured above and disappearance time as measured at the administration site of beagle dogs. And it also proves that the shorter disintegration time gives the less absorption of TSAA 291 and the preparations capable of lasting for 30 min or more show sufficient absorption values.Experiment 2 Similar to the foregoing, two preparations X, Y having different disintegration times were manufactured and administered to rats in their sublingual cavity at a dose of 10 mg rat of TSAA 291 and AUC was estimated by periodic blood collections.
