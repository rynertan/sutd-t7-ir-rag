# Photoimaging compositions containing substituted cyclohexadienone compounds.

## Abstract
Photoimaging compositions comprising A a cyclohex adienone compound as defined, and B addition polymeriz able ethylenically unsaturated monomer. A polymer binder can be present in the compositions. The new imaging compositions are useful in photoimaging products such as proofing papers, printout papers, overlay films and photo polymerizable elements useful for printing and photoresist purposes. The compositions have improved thermal sta bility.
