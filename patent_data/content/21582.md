# Method of making coreless hollow filament bundles for separatory modules and bundles made by said method.

## Abstract
A method of making coreless hollow filament bundles comprises winding a hollow filament 20 around a drum 22 having a number of axially extending vanes 24. The winding is formed in layers, each layer being a helix and adjacent layers being wound in opposite directions axially of the drum so that all the turns of the helix forming one layer cross all the turns of the helices forming the adjacent layers. The winding is then slid along the drum so that it is axially collapsed and forms an annular rope around one end of the drum. The annular rope is then cut into segments, each segment being the length of rope between adjacent vanes 24. Each segment forms a filament bundle and the ends of the filament lengths in each bundle are potted in the usual way.
