# Method and apparatus for cooling a metal strip in a continuous annealing furnace.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for cooling a steel strip in a continuous annealing furnace, wherein the steel strip is continuously conveyed through a heating zone, a soaking zone, a primary cooling zone and, occasionally, an overaging zone and a secondary cooling zone, and cooling of the steel strip is carried out by roll cooling, in which the steel strip is brough into contact with and is turned around a rotatable roll which is con tinuously cooled by a cooling medium. The present inven tion is characterized in that a roll comprising a roll shaft 12 and a shrinkage fitted roll sheath 11 fixed to the roll shaft 12 is used for roll cooling and, further, in that the cooling medium is circulated around the roll shaft through a cooling medium circulating passage 15 which is formed on at least the inner surface of said roll sheath or the outer surface of said roll shaft 12 or both, and is then withdrawn from the roll shaft 12 . The cooling uniformity of a steel strip 1 as seen in the short width direction is improved by the present invention.
