# Electrolyte cell for the automatic and intermittent production of chlorine water.

## Abstract
For the electrolytic production of gaseous chlorine to be absorbed in water for obtaining chlorine water for use in small or modest quantities, the invention provides an electrolytic cell without a partition wall between the anode compartment and the cathode compartment which are otherwise physically separate from and in communication with one another adjacent their lower ends.
