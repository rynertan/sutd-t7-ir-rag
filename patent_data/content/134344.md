# The fluidized bed gasification of extracted coal.

## Abstract
Coal or similar carbonaceous solids are extracted by contacting the solids in an extraction zone 12 with an aqueous solution having a pH above 12.0 at a temperature between 65 C and 110 C for a period of time sufficient to remove bitumens from the coal into said aqueous solution and the extracted solids are then gasified at an elevated pressure and temperature in a fluidized bed gasification zone 60 wherein the density of the fluidized bed is maintained at a value above 160 kg mÂ³. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, water is removed from the aqueous solution in order to redeposit the extracted bitumens onto the solids prior to the gasification step.
