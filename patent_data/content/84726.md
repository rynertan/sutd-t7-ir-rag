# Monitoring gaseous ammonia concentration in flue gases.

## Abstract
A system is disclosed for monitoring the concentration of trace gaseous ammonia in flue gases by simultaneously measuring the temperature and optical transmission of a flue gas ammonia mixture, and computing the ammonia concentration from the temperature and optical trans mission measurements.
