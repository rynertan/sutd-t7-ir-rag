# A disc type cylinder lock.

## Abstract
A disc type cylinder lock comprises a positioning disc 6 slightly movable with in said inner cylinder. The positioning disc has a protroudent piece 12 which is able to enter and escape from a receiving hole 13 formed in said inner cylinder. The key hole 4 of said positioning disc is longer in a radial direction than said key holes of the locking tumbler discs. The positioning disc has a projection 10 on the periphery of said key hole. The key has a longitudinal guide groove and a recess at the terminal of the guide groove. When the key is initially rotated after full insertion thereof, a through groove is formed by aligned notches of said locking tumbler discs and the positioning disc. Upon the further rotation of the key, the side bar enters into said through groove , thereby said projection of the positioning disc enter into said recess of the key, and said protrudent piece of the positioning disc escape from said receiving hole of the inner cylinder. In this way, the inner cylinder can rotate to a predetermined extent with respect to the outer cylinder. Because it is impossible to rotate the inner cylinder unless the key is completely inserted, there is no anxiety that the key is pulled out in an unsuitable situation where all of the locking tumbler discs are not located on the complete unlocking position.

## Description
The present invention relates to a disc type cylinder lock which is capable of effecting locking and unlocking operations of an equipementsuch as a door and the like without any anxiety in which a key is pulled out by reversing locking tumbler discs that are at an incompletely unlocked position. In a disc type cylinder lock of the prior art, as disclosed in U.S. patent No. 2217047 and U.S. patent No. 2862380, discs inserted into an inner cylinder are only lockig tumbler discs which only perform locking and unlocking operations relative to inner and outer cylinders. However, such a disc arrangement cannot prevent the key from rotating in a state where insertion of the key is not yet accomplished, and consequently the innermost locking tumbler disc may be left in a non rotated position. For this reason, a through groove is never formed at peripheries of all of the locking tumbler discs, so that a side bar cannot move toward the inner cylinder, whereby the inner cylinder cannot be unlocked with respect to the outer cylinder. In such a situation of incomplete unlockig, as the key is unable to further rotate, an operator is liable to make misunderstanding that the unlocking operation is finished, and then the operator may undesirably pull out the key by reversely rotating the locking tumbler discs. If the key is pulled out in a state where key holes of the lockig tumbler discs are never aligned each other, at the next time of key insertion, the tip of the key is likely to impinge upon one or more locking tumbler discs which is not rotated at the first operation. In this instance, in order to completely insert the key up to the innermost locking tumbler disc, the operator must shaking the key at anytime when encountering with such an impingement condition, so that it is impossible to get a smooth lockig operation. On the other hand, in a detent mechanism of the prior art, an inner cylinder is provide with a radial hole in its rear end portion. A small detent ball and a compression coil spring are inserted into said radial hole. The detent ball engages with one of two recessions formed in the peripheral surface of an outer cylinder, when the inner cylinder is rotated to the unlocking position or the locking position. It is necessary to provide a surplus space for an exclusive use of the detent mechanism. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved disc type cylinder lock wherein a positioning disc is fitted in an inner cylinder in addition to conventional locking tumbler discs, so that all of the locking tumbler discs can not be rotated unless the key is completely inserted. Another object of the present invention is to an improved disc type cylinder lock which doesnot need any surplus space for an exclusive use of an additional detent mechanism. Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings. The drawings in combination show one embodiment of the present invention. The present invention will be descrided hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. A disc type cylinder lock according to the present invention comprises an outer cylinder 1 having a side bar receiving groove 16 in the inner surface thereof, an inner cylinder 2 fitted in said outer cylinder 1, a plurality of locking tumbler discs 5 inserted in said inner cylinde 2, a positioning disc 6 inserted into said inner cylinder 2, a side bar 7 disposed between the inner cylinder 2 nad the outer cylinder 1, and a key 3 to be inserted into both key holes 4 of said locking tumbler discs 5 and another key hole 4a of said positioning disc 6. The key holes 4 and 4a have substantially semicircular shape. The locking tumbler discs 5 have a notch 8 in a periphery thereof, and said a positioning disc has also a notch 8a in a periphery thereof. The positioning disc 6 is smaller than the locking tumbler discs 5 so that it can move in a radial direction within said inner cylinder 2. The side bar receiving groove 16 has a slanted cam surface 16a. When a rotational force is given to the inner cylinder 2 by the key 3, the side bar 7 abutts on the cam surface, and thereby the side bar 7 is moved in a radial direction through a longitudinal groove 23 formed in the inner cylinder 2. The key hole 4a of the positioning disc 6 is longer in a radial direction than said key hole 4 of the locking tumbler disc 5. The key 3 of semicircular section is provided with a plurality of key surfaces 3a on its side edge. The key surfaces 3a push the straight portions of the key hole 4 and 4a respectively, when the key is rotated after the complete insertion thereof. A protrudent piece 12 is provided on a periphery of said positioning disc 6. The protrudent piece 12 is able to enter into a protrudent piece receiving hole 13 formed in a periphery of said inner cylinder 2. The protrudent piece 12 has a slanted surface 12a, which abutts on an edge of the receiving hole 13 when a rotational force is given to the positioning disc 6 by the key 3. A projecting length of said protrudentpiece 12 is equivalent to a longitudinal difference between saidkey hole 4 and said key hole 4a. A projection 10 is formed on a periphery of said key hole 4a of the positioning disc 6. The key 3 is provided with a guide groove 18 on a side surface which extends longitudinally from the tip thereof. Said projection 10 passes through the recess 18, when the key 3 is inserted into said key hole 4a. The guide groove 18 has a a recess 11 at its terminal in which said projection 10 is engageable. Spacer plate 19 are interposed between the positioning disc 6 and the locking tumbler disc 5, and also between the locking tumbler discs 5, 5 each other. The spacer plates 19 prevent attendant movements produced among the locking tumbler discs 5. Each spacer palte 19 is provided with a stopper protrusion 20 on its periphery, which is engaged with a side opening 15 formed in the inner cylinder 2 so as to prevent rotation of the spacer plate 19 with respect to the inner cylinder 2. Each spacer plate 19 is provided with a notch 8b similar to said notches 8 and 8a on its periphery. The notch 8b alway communicates with said longitudinal opening 23 of the inner cylinder 2. The spacer plate 19 has a key hole 4b of circular shape. In the above disc type cylinder lock, when said key 3 is completely inserted, said projection 10 of the positioning disc 6 is brought to the position facing on said recess 11 of the key 3. Upon the initial rotation of the key 3 after such full insertion, said positioning disc 6 moves slightly in a radial direction through said longitudinal opening 23 of the inner cylinder 2, thereby said projection 10 of the positioning disc 6 fits in said recess 11 of the key 3 and said protrudent piece 12 escapes from said receiving hole 13 of the inner cylinder 2 such that the positioning disc 6 is entirely withdrawn into the inner cylinder 2. When the key 3 is further rotated, said locking tumbler discs 5 and said positioning disc 6 concomitantly rotate to a respectively predetermined extent with respect to the inner cylinder 2, thereby said notches 8 of the locking tumbler discs 5 and said notch 8a of the positioning disc 6 are aligned to said notch 8b of the spacer plate 19 so as to form a through groove 9 which communicates with said longitudinal opening 23 of the inner cylinder 2. A projecting portion 14 of the locking tumbler disc 5 and a projecting portion 14a of the positioning disc 6 can move within said side opening 15 of the inner cylinder 2, and they determine the rotation extent of said discs 5 and 6 respectively by abutting on side surface of said side opening 14. When said key 3 is further rotated, said side bar 7 can escape from said groove 16 of the outer cylinder 1 and enters in to said through groove 9, so that said inner cylinder is unlocked with respect to the outer cylinder 1. Thus, the inner cylinder 2 can be rotated by the key 3. When a stopper plate 24 fixed to a tip portion 2a of the inner cylinder 2 abuts agaisnt a stoppage projection 17 formed on the outer cylinder 1, the inner cylinder 2 stopps to rotate. At this time, a latch plate 25 is fixed to said tip portion 2a of the inner cylinder 2 moves to an unlocking position where it escapes from a latch plate receiver provided on a stationary member such as a box body or door jamb. In this way, as all of the locking tumbler discs 5 cannot be rotated unless the key 3 is completely inserted. there is no probability for the key 3 to be pulled out by reversely rotating the locking tumbler discs 5 in an unsuitable situation where unlocking operation is never completed. Accordingly, the disc type cylinder lock of the present invention can function always with good stability. The outer cylinder 1 is provided with a front edge rim 26 on the front portion of its inner priphery, and a recession 21a is formed in the rear surface of the front edge rim 26. A tip of said side bar 7 is engageable with the recession 21a, when the side bar 7 engages with both said groove 16 of the outer cylinder 1 and said longitudinal opening 23 of the inner cylinder 2, namely, when the side bar 7 is located at the locking position. Moreover, another recession 21b is formed in the rear surface of said front edge rim 26. The tip of said side bar 7 is engageable with the recession 21b, when the side bar 7 is brought to the unlocking position after engaging with both said through groove 9 and the longitudinal opening 23. The side bar 7 is pushed forwards by a compression coil spring 22 which is interposed between its rear end portion of small diameter and the inner bottom surface of said inner cylinder 2. A suitable detent mechanism is constituted by the side bar 7, the recession 21a, 21b and the coil spring 22. The detent mechanism is used for confirming terminations of the locking rotation and the unlocking rotaion of said inner cylinder 2. Namely, when said inner cylinder 2 is rotated to the unlocking position, the side bar 7 is advanced by said coil spring 22 and the tip of said side bar 7 engages with said recession 21b. It is feasible to confirm whether the unlocking operation is completely done or not by virtue of the clicking sound and the vibrational touch on fingertips, which are produced upon said engagement of the side bar 7 and the recession 21b. In the locking operation, when said inner cylinder 2 is rotated to the locking position, the side bar 7 is also advanced by said coil spring 22 and the tip of said side bar 7 engages with another recession 21b. It is also feasible to confirm whether the locking operation is completely done or not by means of the clicking sound and the vibrational touch on fingertips. which are produced upon said engagement of the side bar 7 and the recession 21b. Because said side bar 7 acts not only as a locking member but also as a part of the detent mechanism, it is unnecessary to provide a surplus space for an exclusive use of the detent mechanism. Therefore, it is easy to reduce dimensions of the disc type cylinder lock as a whole. As the number of appropriate parts for the detent mechanism is decreased, it is also easy to reduce the production cost of the disc type cylinder lock.
