# Process for production of hydrogenated hydrocarbon polymers and catalyst useful therefore.

## Abstract
An improved method for making petroleum resins resulting from the thermal polymerization of a steam cracked petroleum distillate fraction wherein the polymeric resin is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation decolorization characterized in that the catalyst is sulfided nickel 2 to 10 wt. tungsten 10 to 25 wt. disposed on a gamma alumina support to provide a fresh catalyst surface area ranging from 120 to 300 mÂ² g.
