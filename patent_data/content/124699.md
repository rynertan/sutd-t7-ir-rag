# Method of producing a sintered body without communicating porosity.

## Abstract
A powder metallurgical method of producing metal bodies using spherical powder, produced by inert gas atom ization, from magnetizable material with a particle size dis tribution closely approximating the so called Fuller curve for maximum density packing of spherical particles. Said powder is magnetized and filled into a form, which may take place before or after magnetisation, said mixed and magnetized powder then sintered in said form with the exclusion of air, to produce a sintered body without communicating porosity.
