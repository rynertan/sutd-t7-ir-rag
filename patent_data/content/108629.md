# MOISTURE MEASUREMENT DEVICE

## Abstract
The moisture content of pellets of polymer for moulding is controlled by comparison of its dielectric loss with that of a reference sample. A hopper through which the pellets pass 11,12 contains sensor s 13A and 13B each containing a sealed reference sample of known moisture content which is kept at the same temperature as that of the material flowing through the buffer. The sample container is annular and disposed between two annular plates to define capacitors which are connected in a bridge circuit 14. The pellets flow through the gaps between the annular plates and the container. A control circuit 15 controls a heating system 10A to increase or decrease the drying of the pellets flowing through the hopper.
