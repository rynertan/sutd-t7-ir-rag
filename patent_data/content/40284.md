## Description
Arrangement for the connection of electrical and or telephone cables to individual users. run from the floor.This invention concerns an arrangement for the con nection of electrical and or telephone cables to supply work tables, run from the floor.Electrical and or telephone cables are usually sup plied to work tables by installing outlets in the walls, or multiple outlet turrets in the floor, from which free cables then carry current to the equipment on the table. However, this solution is sufficiently advantageous only when effected during the construction phase. In already built loca tions, it requires significant modifications, as it also does in case tables must be moved from their original placement. Moreover, the free cables1 as well as the turrets emerging from the Ploor, obstruct the areas between tables and give rise to problems of esthetics and safety.The aim of this invention is thus to avoid the pro blems mentioned above by arranging the electrical and or telephone cables, the electrical outlets and the multiple outlet turrets in such way that, especially in old constructions, esthetics are pre served, pre existing floors must not be removed, no safety problems arise from obstructed areas between tables, and the tables may be freely plac ed in any desired arrangement with no difficulty in hooking up the resulting new connections.This invention solves this problem by placing elec trical and or telephone cables in prefabricated channels to be disposed on the floor and intercalat ed with strips of a rug, said channels being pro vided with covers with a suitable opening through which the cables extracted from a channel are pass ed to supply the individual users apparatus, said covered channels and said strips appearing as a continuous rug.According to this invention, the rug strips may be realized in hard rubber or even in other cheap ma terials like pessed Pelt, thread or hemp, provided they have the same thickness as the channels. These strips as well as the channel covers may be lined with moquette for esthetical purposes.According to this invention, the electrical and. or telephone cables or principal cables are made to join in a single point in the room a box from which branch cables proceed within a transverse channels toward individual longitudinal channels and thus toward the area where each work table is located.According to this invention, beneath each work table is a suitable floorboard shaped so that there is a free space between its lower side and the rug. The free space between said floorboard and the surPace of the rug underiieath allows for the cables to be arranged by drawing them out of the channels, as will be described below. On the upper side of the Bloorboard are one or more multiple outlet turrets Por supplying current to tha apparatus on the table.Moreover, the surPace of said floorboard has one or more openings corresponding to the ends of the table through which the cables are passed to con nect to the multiple outlet turrets.As shown by the above discussion, each table may occupy any position with respect to any of the can nels, provided that at least one area of the floor board covers a sufficient area of longitudinal chan nel to allow passage of the cables. To bring out the cables which run from the channel to the turret of each work table, the channel co 1 ver in the area of the desired is removed and re placed with a cover equipped with a suitable open ing through which the cables extracted from the channel are passed. The channel covers, as well as the substitute covers with l e op1tty for the ca bles, are applied to the channel using a known sys tem for example with stops inserted under pressure in gaskets glued to the sides of the channel ad next to its edges. IJaturally, screws or analogous and equivalent devices may be used instead of the stops.Said covers may also be covered with a la yer of surface finishing analogous to that of the rug. Finally,the apparatus on the table is in its turn connected to the turret on the floorboard by plug ginj in the lines. These lines may be left free or be passed through a tube fixed laterally to the ta ble, on the inside or outside.As a variation of this invention, the tables may be equipped at the manufacturer s with said floorboard, which may be an integral part of them, as well as the one or more multiple outlet turrets described above and the internal passage in the table opening directly on the top of the floorboard through which the cables are passed. For already built tables, Bloorboards are us3 of a size and shape suitable to the work tables themsel ves. Supplying current to work tables in already existing lorations does not require modiPications to the floor, since it is sufficient to use a rug as described above to arrange all the cables bran ching from a single point in the room represented by the box.The benefits arising from the arrangement according to this invention thus safety the aims set for it.In fact, Prom only one branch point, electrical and or telephone cables can be arranged in any type of room with no modifications, while preserving the esthetics and eliminating. at the same time hazards due to obstructed passages between work tables.Moreover, these may be moved into practically any position with no difficulty in the necessary elec trical connections.The object oP this invention is illustrated here with reference to a preferred embodiment represen ted in the attached non limiting, exemplifying de signs.Figure 1 shows a partially sectioned Pront view oP a work table equipped with a floorboardaccording to this invention, placed on a rug according to this invention.Figure P. shows a side view of a work table as in figure 1.
