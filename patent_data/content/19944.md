## Description
Device for rounding off the ends of the tibres of brushesThe present invention relates to a device for rounding off the ends of the fibres of brushes, more in particular fibres which are made from plastics.It is a known fact that in the production of brushes, after the fibres are planted, the free ends of the fibres are shaved with the purpose to work off the inequalities which arise when the fibres are being planted.It is also known that through this shaving, at the ends of the fibres sharp edges come into existence, which are not permissible for certain brush types.As a matter of fact, such sharp edges could, for instance in the case of tooth brushes, wound the gums, whereas in other cases, for instance in the case of hairbrushes, such sharp ends could cause hairs to be pulled out and or the skin of the haid to be injured.It is also known that, in order to avoid, for instance in the case of tooth brushes, any injuries, and in the case of hairbrushes, the pulling out of hairs, and to obtain a good massage of the head skin, the brush fibres must be rounded off after shaving them.Consequently, this invention relates to such a device for rounding off the fibre ends of brushes with fibres made from piastics, this device being extremely simple but very efficient.This device according to the invention mainly comprises a device for rounding off the ends of the fibres of brushes, in which there is used a disc moving along the fibre ends to be rounded off, which is provided with an appropriate abrasive and or a suitable profile, characterized in that the aforesaid disc is fixed on a rotative shaft which, apart from its rotation about its own axis, is made to move in a circle about a second axis, and the rotational speeds of the aforesaid shaft about its own axis, on the one hand, and about the aforesaid second axis, on the other hand, can be adjusted independently the one in relation to the other.With the purpose to throw more light on the characteristics of the invention, a preferred embodiment is described of a device according to the invention, reference being made to the attached drawing.This device mainly comprises a disc 1 that carries out the rounding off operation proper and that is set up opposite to the brush 2 the fibres of which are to be rounded off. The disc 1 is fixed on a shaft 3 which is rotatably mounted, so as to be free to rotate, in a housing 4 and is provided with a pinion 5, which is in constant mesh with a pinion 6 fixed itself on a shaft 7, which in its turn is rotatably mounted in a housing 8, a belt pulley 9 being fixed on the shaft 7.The housing 8 is also rotatably mounted in a second housing 10 and provided with a belt pulley 11 which is driven independently of the belt pulley 9.The housing 10, which is adjustable in height, is fixed on a slide 12, for instance by means of suitable bolts 13 14, this slide being capable of being appropriately moved, for instan ce by means of a suitable crank mechanism.On the side which is turned towards the brush 2, the disc 1 may be executed differently, depending on the kind of fibres, diameter of same and time available for rounding off the fibre ends.Thus the side of the disc 1 that faces the brush may be provided with hardened teeth, have a milled edge, be sandblasted or made rough in any way, or the aforesaid side may be covered with an abrasive, diamond grit, hard metal grit, file pieces, etc.The brush 2 is always maintained stopped, whilst the disc 1 will be moved in a given way in relation to the brush 2.A first motion of the disc 1 is obtained through the fact that it is driven around its axis 3, via the pinions 5 and 6, shaft 7 and belt pulley 9.A second motion of the disc 1 is obtained by turning the housing 4 together with the housing 8 by means of the belt pulley 11, resulting in an excentric rotation about the axis 7 being imparted to the disc 1 during its rotation about its axis 3.A third motion of the disc 1 is finally obtained through the reciprocating motion of the slide 12 according to the arrowP, resulting in the whole assembly 1 through 11 having a reciprocating motion under the brush 2.Due to the combination of the three aforesaid motions, and at the same time to the selection of the appropriate abrasive and or to the appropriate execution of the disc 1, there is obtained that the free ends of the fibres of the brush 2 are machined in a great number of directions in a very short time, in order to efficiently round off the ends of these fibres. The axis of the second rotating shaft will preferably run through the intersection or approximately through the intersection of the diagonals drawn in the rectangle of the brush body wherein fibres are planted.It is clear that by independently driving the belt pulleys 9 and 11 by means of individual motors, for instance individual motors with a continuous r.p.m. adjustment system, the relative speeds of the shafts 3 and 7 can be adjusted the one in relation to the other, in order that the result of the rounding off may be influenced.It is clear that the invention is by no means limited to the embodiment described as an example and illustrated by the attached drawing, but that such a device can be executed in various shapes and with various dimensions without going outside the scope of the invention.
