# HAND HELD ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES

## Abstract
A Hand Held Electrical Appliance, specifically an electric al hair dryer has a housing, insulated power supply conduc tors, heating element, motor and fan, switches and controls, and the necessary internal wiring and thermal and electrical insulation. The appliance has switch means which is sealed against water entry and has an actuator requiring continuous manual pressure to hold the switch in closed position. When the pressure is released, for example if the appliance is dropped, the switch means is open thereby avoiding risk of electric shock if for example the appliance, when connected to the supply, is immersed in water.
