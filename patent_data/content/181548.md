# Manifold and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A manifold, especially a supply or receiving tank in a heat exchanger, is provided as an extruded drawn tube 2 with outwards, longitudinally running protrusion part 3 . Fastening flanges 4 with a diameter larger than the width of the protrusion part are an integrated portion of the protru sion part. The manufacturing method comprises extrusion or drawing of the shaped tube 2 with protrusion part 3 , perforating of the protrusion part resulting in a plurality of apertures 32 which are transformed in one or more steps by cold deformation into fastening flanges 4 of desirable diameter, shape and length.
