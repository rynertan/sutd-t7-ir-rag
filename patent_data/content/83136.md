# Catadioptric objective.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a compact, high aperture, catadioptric objective. Such an objective comprises a negative lens, a main mirror disposed on the peripheral area of a surface of this lens, a positive front lens, a counter mirror facing the main mirror and disposed on the central area of a surface of the front lens, and a field lens adjacent to the negative lens. It is an object of the invention to provide a light weight, low cost structure for an objective of the above kind, without detoriating the advantageous optical characteristics. This object is achieved by disposing the field lens in spaced relation to the negative lens, while dimensioning the composite objective in such a manner that
