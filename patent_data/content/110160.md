# Floating point arithmetic operation system.

## Abstract
A floating point arithmetic operation system perform ing an arithmetic operation on two given operands X, Y and providing the result Z of the arithmetic operation, the op erands X and Y being each classified according to their attributes and at least part of the bits of the operand X, at least part of the bits of the operand Y or a predetermined set of bits being adopted as at least part of the result Z of the operation when the results of the classifications are one of predetermined combinations.
