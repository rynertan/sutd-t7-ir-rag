# Control method and control device for a down the hole rock drill.

## Abstract
When drilling deep boreholes with a down the hole drill 15 , the pressure and the flow of the motive fluid are controlled so that the impact velocity of the piston hammer of the drill is kept within narrow limits independently of the counter pressure in the borehole. For this purpose the quotient of pressure and flow can be held substantially constant.
