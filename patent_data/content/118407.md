# Bonded reinforced plastic structures.

## Abstract
A bonded reinforced plastic structure which comprises reinforced plastic parts of sheet molding compound or bulk molding compound, coated with a primer coat and bonded together with a thermoplastic block copolymer. The primer coat comprises a moisture curable polyisocyanate. The block copolymer comprises from 40 to 80 weight percent crystal line polyester or polyamide segments and 20 to 60 weight percent amorphous polyamide or polyether segments and has a crystalline melting point of at least 155 C. The bonded structure is adapted to survive the hot environment of paint curing ovens.
