# High flash point low surface energy solvent systems for polyimide conformal coatings.

## Abstract
An improved wire enamel consisting essentially of the following materials by weight wherein basis is wire enamel weight at least 50 by wt. of a polar organic solvent about 2 8 by wt. of a polyimide precursor which can be cured to yield a polyimide polymer about 0.5 to about 25 by weight of the substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent for the polyimide precursor having a surface tension and polarity greater than that of the halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon described below or a substituted aromatic hydrocarbon having a dipole moment less than or equal to the dipole moment of the halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon described below about 5 to 40 by wt of a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon and 0 to about 1 by wt. of an organosilane which increases the adhesion of the polyimide to an underlying substrate.
