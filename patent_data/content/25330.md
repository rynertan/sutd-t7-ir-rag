# METHOD OF REWRITING DATA IN A NON VOLATILE MEMORY, AND SYSTEM THEREFOR

## Abstract
The non volatile memory 1 is provided with a flag area 13 in which information a flag bit value indicating the initiation of an operation for the modification of the data content of the memory 1 is written prior to the rewriting operation, and in which information a different flag bit value indicating the completion of the modification operation is written after the rewriting operation, whereby an interruption in power which has occurred during rewriting can be readily detected by read ing out the information from the flag area 13 after the restora tion of power.
