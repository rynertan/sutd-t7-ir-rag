# Flame retention head assembly for fuel burners.

## Abstract
A flame retention head assembly for use in a fuel burner having a fuel nozzle 9 mounted coaxially within an air pipe 1 . This assembly comprises a continuosly contoured, outwardly diverging flame retention head 31 mounted concentrically within the air pipe 1 in front of the fuel nozzle 9 . This head 31 successively defines, starting from its inlet end an air and fuel mixture chamber 45 a first expansion chamber 53 a throttle 54 and a second expansion chamber 57 . A spinner plate 63 is mounted transversally across the inlet end of the head 31 . This plate 63 comprises a central ring provided with a central hole having a diameter substantially identical to the one of the fuel nozzle 9 , and a plurality of blades regularly distributed around the ring to cause air to enter and swirl into the mixture chamber 45 . A roundshaped deflector is also mounted concentrically transversally within the retention head 31 , to cause the air and fuel entering the head 31 through its inlet end to stay longer within the first or second expansion chamber 53, 57 . The second expansion chamber 57 is provided with circumferentially spaced air apertures to allow air to pass into the retention head 31 to sustain combustion therein.
