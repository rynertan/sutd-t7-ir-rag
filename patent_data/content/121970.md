# Apparatus for mounting a daisy wheel in a daisy wheel printer, and daisy wheel.

## Abstract
An apparatus for mounting a daisy wheel 3 on a shaft 2 driven by a motor 1 in a daisy wheel printer comprises a driving head 4 carried by the driven shaft at its free end, while the daisy wheel is provided with a coupling member 10 . This coupling member is adapted to be coupled in a rotation fixed manner with and to be removed from the driv ing head by moving the daisy wheel in a substantial radial direction. A locking means 11 is movable between a re lease position in which the daisy wheel is movable in a sub stantial radial direction with respect to the driving head and a working position in which the daisy wheel is locked on the driving head. A daisy wheel to be used in a printer with such an appa ratus comprises a central portion 7 and a number of ra dially extending spokes 8 carrying at their ends a letter, figure or a similar character. Two ribs 10 are formed in V shape on the one side of the daisy wheel.
