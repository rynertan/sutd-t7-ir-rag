# Brushless DC motor.

## Abstract
A brushless D. C. motor is disclosed having two bifilar winding wire pairs P1, P3 and P2, P4 with each bifilar pair forming alternate windings. Each winding P1 to P4 is switched by a transistor T1 T4 which has a back poled diode 45 connected in parallel therewith. A control circuit sequences energization of single windings with each winding energized being in a different bifilar pair than the next preceding energized winding whereby when a transistor is switched off the other winding of the bifilar pair and the associated back poled diode protect the transistor and provide an energy conserving heat eliminating path for the induced current. Each winding is further formed of a pair of subwindings having an angle of separation therebetween approximately half the angular separation between adjacent windings.
