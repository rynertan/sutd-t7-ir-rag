# A variable inlet area turbine.

## Abstract
A turbocharger for an internal combustion engine wherein a turbine wheel 18 in chamber 47 is driven by the engine s exhaust gases supplied to inlet volute 44 in troducing the gases to the chamber through radially extend ing annular inlet passage 45 containing stationary vanes 60 . The inlet area of passage 45 is selectively variable by moving a regulating ring part 61 slotted at 70 to receive the vanes axially relative to wall 46 of the passage. The ring part 61 is part of a thin walled regulating element 62 additionally comprising concentric tubular flanges 64, 67 . Flange 67 is in sliding contact with a stationary sealing ring 71 which prevents exhaust gases which may have en tered region 122 behind the ring part 61 from passing un der that ring part to the chamber 47 . Thus pressure builds up in region 122 compelling gases from the volute to pass between the ring part 61 and wall 46 , consequently the gases driving the turbine are substantially prevented from by passing the regulated inlet passage 45 .
