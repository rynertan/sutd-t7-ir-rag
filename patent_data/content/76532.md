# A process for the preparation of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide.

## Abstract
In continuous preparation of tertiary butyl hydroperox ide by the direct oxidation of isobutane in dense phase reaction mixture at supercritical temperature and pressure of the mixture, and under conditions relating to oxygen and isobutane content of the mixture, improvement in selectivity to tertiary butyl hydroperoxide is realized by a process which comprises conducting a plurality of such oxidation reactions each in one of a series of dense phase reaction zones by continuously introducing isobutane reactant into the first reaction mixture in the series, continuously introducing oxygen reactant into each reaction mixture of the series, and withdrawing a continuous flow from each mixture of the series and introducing this flow into the next mixture of the series, with the provision that the continuous flow with drawn from the last mixture of the series is taken from the process as tertiary butyl hydroperoxide.
