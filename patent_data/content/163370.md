# Actuator.

## Abstract
An actuator for use in robots or manipulators includes a thin walled inner cylinder 1 made of a rubber like elastic material and an extensible and contractible reinforcing braided structure 3 surrounding the inner cylinder. The actuator is contracted to obtain contractive force when pressurized fluid is supplied into the inner cylinder to expand it in its radial direction, while changing the braided angles of the braided structure. According to the invention, the inner cylinder includes initial compressive stresses in its inner portion to partially reduce circumferential tensile stresses in the cylinder on supplying the pressurized fluid to mitigate fatigue of the inner cylinder due to repeated circumferential tensile stresses, thereby greatly improving the durability in use of the actuator.

## Description
ACTUATOR This invention relates to an actuator. operable by fluid pressure. particularly suitable for actuating means for pneumatically driven robots or manipulators. The present inventors have investigated and developed such actuators operated in response to inner pressure to operate, for example, arms and handles of robots. Such an actuator includes a thin walled inner cylinder made of an elastomer such as rubber or the like and an extensible and contractible braided structure covering and reinforcing the inner cylinder. When the inner cylinder is supplied with pneumatic pressure, the inner cylinder expands to increase its diameter and simultaneously shortens its axial length to provide a suitable contracting force for arms or hands. In such an expanding operation of the inner cylinder, the braided structure is also expanded to increase its braided angles to what is called angles of repose .Such a movement of the braided structure to change its braided angles is referred to herein as pantograph movement . because the movement of rhombus patterns of elements forming the braided structure is like the movement of a pantograph. When fluid pressure is applied in a thin walled innner cylinder having an inner diamter r1 and an outer diameter r2, a circumferential stress at is indicated by the following equation.EMI2.1 where pl is internal pressure. The maximum and minimum stresses Qmax and vain . occur at r r1 and r r2 and are indicated as follows.EMI2.2 In the case of a typical thin walled inner cylinder having an inner diameter of 4mm and an outer diameter of 5mm, the ratio of the maximum to minimum stress is as much as 1.28 or a a . 1.28. It is max min understood that every time the internal pressure is applied into the cylinder. its inner surface is repeatedly subjected to the maximum stresses, resulting in fatigue failure of the cylinder so as to shorten its service life. It has therefore been desired for many years to obtain actuators which are rugged and durable in use. The present invention aims to provide an improved actuator highly durable in use for a very long period of time by a particular constitution of its inner cylinder, in order to avoid fatigue due to the inherent construction of the actuator. The present invention provides an actuator including a thin walled inner cylinder made of an elastic material. usually a rubber or rubber like elastic material, and an extensible and contractible reinforcing braided structure surrounding the inner cylinder, the actuator being contractible in its axial direction to obtain contractive force when pressurized fluid is supplied into the inner cylinder to expand it in its radial direction, while changing the braided angles of the braided structure, characterized in that the inner cylinder includes initial compressive stresses jn it s inner portion. In a preferred embodiment of the invention. the inner cylinder includes the initial compressive stresses caused by reversing the inner cylinder its inside for its outside after forming and vulcanizing. The invention will be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. la, lb and lc are perspective views illustrating steps for introducing initial compressive stresses into an inner cylinder of an actuator according to the invention Fig. 2 is a schematic illustration of distribution of initial circumferential stresses in an inner cylinder of an actuator according to the invention and Fig. 3 is a front elevation, partially in section, of an actuator according to the invention. Fig la illustrates a thin walled inner cylinder 1 immediately after it is formed and vulcanized and a mandrel 2 preferably made of silicone rubber. The thus formed and vulcanized inner cylinder 1 is removed from the mandrel 2 in the direction of the arrow in Fig. lb, while the inside of the cylinder 1 is being turned outside as shown in Fig. lb. In this manner, the inner cylinder 1 shown in Fig. lc has been reversed its inner surface for its outer surface. As a result, the inner cylinder 1 is under a particular stressed condition in which compressive stresses acting upon the inner portion of the cylinder balance with tensile stresses on the outer portion of the cylinder as shown schematically inFig. 2 illustrating a distribution of circumferential stresses. In this case, the maximum circumferential compressive stress a is approximately indicated as follows.EMI5.1 where E is the modulus of elasticity of the material of the inner cylinder, rl is the cylinder inner diameter and r2 is the cylinder outer diameter. In the case of an inner cylinder having inner and outer diameters of 4 and 5mm, the maximum circumferential compressive stress is a E x 0.2.Although the right side of this equation is actually minus. the minus sign is neglected because the stress is compressive. If the modulus of elasticity E of the material is 10 2 kgf cm . this initial compressive stress is approximately 2 kgf cm2. As above described, the maximum circumferential tensile stress a max isEMI5.2 at the inside of the cylinder, where P1 is the internal or operating pressure. The operating pressure 2 is usually less than 4 kgf cmê . When an operating pressure of 4 kgf cmê and inner and outer diameters of 4 and Smm are substituted in the above equation, the maximum tensile stress on the inside of the cylinder subjected to the maximum operating pressure of 2 4 kgf cm2is about 18 kgfXcm2. However, there is the initial compressive stress 2 kgf cmê at the inside of the cylinder, so that the maximum tensile stress is reduced to 16 kgf cmê . In other words, it is evident that the maximum tensile stress is reduced by more than 11 . Fig. 3 illustrates an actuator according to the invention comprising a thin walled inner cylinder 1 . The inner cylinder 1 is preferably made of a rubber or rubber like elastomer which is air impermeable and flexible. However. other materials equivalent thereto, for example various kinds of plastics may be used for this purpose. The actuator shown in Fig. 3 further comprises a reinforcing braided structure 3 extensibly and contractibly covering the inner cylinder 1 , nipples 4 tightly fitted in both ends of the inner cylinder 1, clamp sleeves 5 restraining the braided structure 3 to the inner cylinder 1, and a fitting 6 for applying the operating pressure p into the inner cylinder 1 . When an operating pressure p is applied into the inner cylinder ll through the fitting 6, the inner cylinder 1 is expanded and the braided structure is simultaneously expanded from the position shown by solid lines to that shown by phantom lines in Fig. 3 to enlarge the initial braided angles 6 to approximately 54044 of what is called angle of repose in the pantograph movement of the braided structure 2 so as to shorten the distance Q between the nipples 4. Tensile forces caused by the shortening of the nipples 4 of the actuator are of course applicable to operations of robots and manipulators. In the above embodiment, the initial compressive stresses have been introduced in the inner portion of the thin walled inner cylinder by the reversing of the cylinder so that its inside becomes its outside after forming and vulcanizing the inner cylinder. It is, however, clearly evident that initial stresses may be caused in the inner portion of the inner cylinder with the aid of particular compositions of agents in the course of vulcanizing or hardening the cylinder. As can be seen from the above description, according to the invention initial compressive stresses are caused in the inner portion of a thin walled inner cylinder of an actuator so as to partially reduce circumferential stresses in the cylinder on applying inner pressure into the inner cylinder to mitigate the fatigue of the inner cylinder due to repeated circumferential stresses, thereby greatly improving the durability of the actuator
