# Process for producing aluminum bearing grain oriented silicon steel strip.

## Abstract
A process for producing aluminium bearing grainorien ted silicon steel strip from a silicon steel slab containing up to 0.02 carbon, 0.01 to 0.1 aluminium, 2.7 to 4.0 sili con, and 0.002 to 0.02 nitrogen, the balance being iron and unavoidable impurities, said slab optionally containing at least one of 0.1 to 0.5 antimony and 0.01 to 1.0 copper, said process comprising recrystallization hot rolling said slab, said rolling being commenced when said slab has a temperature up to 1,250 C, and effected at a total reduction rate of at least 80 with a plurality of passes, including at least one pass having a reduction rate of at least 35 , until said steel has a temperature of 900 C strain accumulation finish hot rolling said steel at a total reduction rate of at least 40 and at a steel temperature up to 900 C annealing said hot rolled steel continuously at a temperature of 700 C to 950 C cold rolling said steel annealing said cold rolled steel con tinuously at a temperature of 700 C to 900 C for primary recrystallization and finish annealing said steel, an atmo sphere gas containing at least 30 of nitrogen being in troduced during the heating step of said finish annealing when a temperature of 800 C to 1,000 C prevails.
