# Low voltage serial to parallel to serial charge coupled device.

## Abstract
This serial to parallel to serial SPS charge coupled device CCD shift register memory has a serial output shift register 14 with stage gate electrode structures 30 to 36 that are interdigitated with the gate electrode structures of each last stage 38 of a plurality of parallel shift registers 12 to transfer interlaced data bits from the parallel shift registers to the serial output register in a sequential order. This is done without employing a fixed voltage midway between the highest clock voltage and reference potential in the parallel register in what is commonly called a midway store to regulate the transfer of data to the interdigitated gate electrode structures.
