# CIRCUIT MOUNTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An electrical circuit element 16 is maintained in place within the drop center 24 of a vehicle wheel 10 by encasing the circuit within a cylindrical plastic housing 14 which is formed into an arcuate shape. The housing is held in place by wires 18, 19 which are connected to the ends of an extension spring 22 which applies sufficient tension to keep the housing from moving during heavy braking or due to centrifugal force. The mounting assembly is configured to move to an out of the way position when contacted by a tire iron or by elements of a tire mounting machine to prevent damage to the circuit when a tire is mounted or demounted. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the circuit 16 is encased within a unitary annular member 56 .
