# Speech recognition apparatus.

## Abstract
A speech recognition apparatus has a parameter generator 2, 4 for sequentially generating acoustic parame ter data corresponding to input speech, a data generator 1, 8 for supplying at least one phoneme data having similarity higher than a predetermined value in each segment to a memory 12 on the basis of acoustic parameter data from the parameter generator 2, 4 , and recognition circuit 14 for recognizing the input speech based on the phoneme data stored in the memory 12 . This speech recognition apparatus further has a coefficient generator RAM for generating a compatibility coefficient between two continu ous phonemes, and a control circuit 10 for updating plural times the similarity data in the memory 12 with the com patibility coefficient relating to the corresponding phoneme data as a function.
