# Device for collecting molten metal break outs in casting of light metals.

## Abstract
A device is described for collecting molten metal break outs which may occur during direct chill casting of light metal, e.g. aluminum or aluminum alloy ingots. The device includes a water cooled mould 12 of the cross sectional shape of the ingot desired, this mould having a vertically moveable base portion 15 to support the ingot formed and being disposed above a pit 10 for receiving the resultant casting and means for applying water onto the freshly solidified surface of the ingot as it emerges from the mould downwardly into the pit. The novel feature consists of at least one hollow container 21 adjacent the side or sides of the ingot being formed, each container being packed with dry, highly heat absorptive, finely divided material 23 having a large surface to volume ratio. Each container has an open top positioned a short distance below the mould such as to catch a break out of molten metal at the exit of the mould.
