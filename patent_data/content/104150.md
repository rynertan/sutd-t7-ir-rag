# Three dimensional reticulated structure having tapered ends.

## Abstract
A three dimensional reticulated structure or space lattice structure is formed of metal rods 1 tapered at their ends so that the loss of cross section leads to a thickening of the tubular wall 2 of the rod, whereby it can be threaded at its ends 1a by removal of material without losing mechanical strength. This is preferably attained by coining through at least six successive passes in dies of increasingly smaller dimensions. The knots or junctions are bored metal cups 3 , said rods 1 converging into the bores thereof and being fixed simply by bolts 4 . A plug 7 of concrete reinforced with steel fibres closes the base of the cup 3 while allowing its reopening for inspection and maintenance, and provides further mechanical strength to the assembly.
