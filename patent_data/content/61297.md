# PENETRANT INSPECTION METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
During removal of excess fluorescent penetrant com position on a surface the surface may be heated and the consequential loss of sensitivity restored by application of a developer containing a sensitivity restorer, generally a solvent for the fluorescent dye. The penetrant composition is new and may be of simpler formulation than is now conventional. The developer composition is new and may contain the restorer, volatile carrier and, optionally, particu late developer and surfactant. In any developer composition for use with fluorescent penetrants it is desirable to include, in the developer a solution of a dye that absorbs blue and violet radiation but that is substantially transparent to ultraviolet and yellow radiation.
