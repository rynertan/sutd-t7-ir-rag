# Electron beam exposure apparatus.

## Abstract
An electron beam exposure apparatus includes an electromagnetic type deflector 7 for deflecting an electron beam 124 in accordance with an analog signal correspond ing to a digital signal which specifies an exposure region of a sample and an electrostatic type deflector 8 for deflect ing the electron beam to a desired position in the exposure region. A difference signal between the analog signal and a reference analog signal corresponding to the digital signal is taken out for compensating the amount of deflection of the electron beam in the electrostatic type deflector.
