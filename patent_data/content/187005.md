# Methods and apparatus for purifying liquid materials.

## Abstract
This invention relates to rotary processors and methods for purifying viscous liquid material by liquid liquid extraction. Material is introduced to extracting apparatus including a rotary processor 10 comprising at least one annular channel 18 on a rotor 12 and enclosed by a housing 16 to form a mixing passage 28 . Material is dragged forward by the rotating channel 18 from the passage inlet 34 past a blocking member 42 . Solvent introduced to the passage 28 , e.g. by spray means 44 , is carried downstream with and dispersed in material collected at a passage end wall 38 . In one embodiment the blocking member comprises a spreader 42 which spreads material as films 52 on the channel walls 20 . In another embodiment, sparging means 72 sparges solvent into a pool 76 of material collected upstream of the blocking member 70 . Separation of solvent from material may involve rotary devolatilizing or phase separating processors 100 , which may be arranged with the mixing processor for cocurrent or countercurrent, multi stage series operation.
