# Sieve plates and distillation columns.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to sieve plates made of po lymeric material suitable for use in distillation columns. The sieve plate of polymeric material comprises a a circular base provided with i a central axial aperture for receiving a shaft, ii an additional aperture for receiving a tubular member, and iii perforations of uniform average diameter which represent in total a free area of between 3 and 20 , b a flexible, flared lip around the circumference of the base to form a sealing contact with the inner walls of a column, and c means for retaining the sieve plate on a shaft. The sieve plate affords great flexibility because the number of plates and the spacing between the plates in a column can be adjusted as desired and the plates can be mass produced.
