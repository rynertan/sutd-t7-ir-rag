# Shaped articles of intractable polymers.

## Abstract
Shaped articles composed of polymers formed from residues which are not melt processable characterised in that the shaped article has been formed from a readily processable melt of a copolymer containing said residues together with in chain temperature labile residues and has been subse quently heated to remove the labile constituents with recom bination of the resultant polymeric residues. Preferably the processable melt should be in the form of an anisotropic melt so that the shaped article may be in oriented form prior to removal of the residues. Typically the shaped articles are articles of thin section composed of p hydroxybenzoic acid residues.
