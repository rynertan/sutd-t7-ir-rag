# METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR AUTOMATICALLY COMPENSATING FOR VARIATIONS IN OUTPUT RESPONSE CHARACTERISTICS OF SENSORS AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
This disclosure is concerned with a novel technique for automatically fitting the output response characteristic curve of a measurement sensor to that of an ideal or refer ence sensor through determination of output variations in response to the same input stimulus near one end or point of the curve, storing the differences for automatic correc tion of the measurement sensor output by effectively superimposing the curves at such end, determination of output variations at another end or point of the curve, and effectively relatively pivoting the measurement sensor out put curve about the said one end to cause substantial superposition of the other end or point of the curve and the span therebetween, thereby to provide stored signals for automatically correcting the output response of the mea surement sensor, when in subsequent measurement use, over the complete characteristic response curve between its ends or selected points.
