## Description
This invention relates to a knee joint prosthesis for permanent anchorage in the bone tissue of a knee joint in the human body. Various methods are already known for dealing with knee joint destruction and other joint diseases or malformations in joints in the human body through prosthetic surgical intervention. The joints which have then been objects of such prosthetic surgical intervention are primarily the knee joint, hip joint, elbow joint, shoulder joint, foot joint and finger joint. The present invention is not confined to any one of these joints but will hereinafter be described mainly in conjunction with knee joints, since it is there that there is a pronounced need to extend the indication range for knee joint replacement so that considerably younger patients than at the present time could be offered a solution to their knee problems. The disease caused defects concerned are rheumatic knee joint diseases and wear injuries that in the first instance affect joint cartilage and in the second instance underlying bone tissue which is worn away and gives rise to a varying degree of joint defect. A defect of this nature may be localized and affect only one or two of the three compartments of the knee joint as in the majority of cases of knee joint wear, but it may also be generalized as in rheumatic disease, when both the medial and the lateral knee joint compartments and also the femuro patellar joint involved in the same destructive process. In localized knee joint destruction, if the destruction is limited solely to the medial or lateral knee joint compartment, only this part is provided with a prosthesis, in which case it is customary to speak of a demiprosthetic procedure half joint prosthesis . If two or three compartments are involved in the arthrosis, it will usually be a matter of a total prosthesis. This is nearly always the case with rheumatic diseases. The disease caused defect found in connection with a joint destroying disease or wear injury is often extended in conjunction with prosthetic surgery to make room for the prosthesis and to create a mechanical lock between prosthesis and bone. The contour of the skeleton end is thus removed to fit more or less exactly into the for example multicornered box formed by the surrounding prosthesis. The surgical defect thus encroaches upon intact joint skeleton. The need of stabilization between the parts of the prosthesis varies from one defect situation to another. If the joint ligament apparatus is defective it is prior art knowledge to provide the opposed articulating joint replacements with a coupling in the form of a hinge or piston mechanism which replaces the stabilisation normally obtained through ligaments and cruciate ligaments. Such stabilized prostheses are however rather voluminous and increase the surgical defect. In the majority of cases, around 90 per cent of all knee joint destructions, the ligaments and cruciate ligaments are nevertheless so intact that no stabilized prosthesis is needed. All the same, for a moderate but not grave ligament injury some type of retention between the parts of the prosthesis may be necessary and can then be built into the prosthesis design. For example it is prior art knowledge to cup the articulation socket of the prosthesis and to adapt the joint head thereto. A prosthesis of this type is designated constrained. In a constrained prosthesis there is a good congruence between joint surfaces, implying good stability and less compression stress per unit of area but also increased friction between the joint surfaces and less possibility of movement in certain planes, e.g. translation. A constrained prosthesis retards movements and thus gives rise to strains in mobility planes that are not permitted by the prosthesis and this implies that the prosthesis absorbs constrained forces. This strain will be transmitted to the transition between prosthesis and bone. Experience shows that constrained prostheses have a very high loosening frequency which probably is due to the absorption of constrained forces which are thus transmitted to the transition between prosthesis and bone. Although a constrained prosthesis can be made less voluminous than the stabilized prosthesis the disadvantage of the high loosening frequency nevertheless remains. In recent times, therefore, a new type of prosthesis has been developed, namely a semi constrained or non constrained prosthesis. These prostheses have a surface geometry which in principle is characterized by a rounded joint ball which rests against a relatively flat joint socket and these types of prosthesis obviously impose rather high demands on the ligaments and cruciate ligaments for their stabilisation but in recompense the ligaments and musculature absorb the strain to which the prosthesis is subjected in all motional planes and the prosthesis will thus not brake the strain on account of its structure so that the constrained forces acting on the transition between prosthesis and bone will be reduced. The frequency of loosening is also significantly lower with this type of prosthesis than with the earlier type, but today the follow up time for semi constrained and non constrained prostheses is far too short to permit any definite conclusions to be reached with regard to the long term forecast for loosening frequency. One thing, however, is perfectly clear with regard to this type of prosthesis and that is that the contact surface between the parts of the prosthesis is reduced which leads to a greater load with compression forces per unit of area, which involves a risk of mechanical wear. In addition, exacting demands are imposed on the ligaments since the prosthesis is very little stabilized in its own structure. In summing up, it may therefore be said that a constrained prosthesis is exposed to a greater risk of loosening than a non constrained prosthesis, but the risk of loosening is by no means excluded in that the prosthesis is non constrained. Moreover, there is a greater risk of mechanical wear problems with non constrained prostheses. The problem of mechanical wear has naturally also been studied. On the basis of 15 years of clinical experience quite a lot is known about the behaviour of metals, plastics and ceramics as joint replacement materials. Tests have been performed on replacement of both joint socket and joint head with the same material, and different material combination possibilities have also been tried. Steel against steel, for example, has been found to be unfavourable, whereas ceramic against ceramic has proved to be a favourable combination in view of resistance to mechanical wear. This latter combination, however, appears to be advantageous only in ball and socket joints. Generally, metal against polyethylene is considered to be an acceptable combination, and it is probable that this particular combination will remain in the forefront of interest for at least another ten years. Polyethylene is biologically inert and has a beneficial elastic deformation that dampers peak forces. Polyethylene is also highly resistant to permanent deformation if the component has a thickness of at least 6 mm and if it is metal supported in relation to the bone surface. The issue being discussed today therefore is not whether or not the joint surface of the tibial component in a knee joint shall consist of polyethylene but is rather a matter of which metal should be combined with the polyethylene as a replacement material for the joint surface of the thigh bone end. No really certain alternative is, however, afforded here. Further studies of mechanical wear resistance, corrosion resistance, toxic effect etc. are required. Attempts have been made in various ways to increase the anchorage stability of the joint substitute in the bone tissue. More than twenty years of experience has now been gained of cement fixation with methyl acrylate of joint replacements, particularly in hip joints, and it is known that the forecast in the 10 year perspective is reasonable as regards clinical stability of prostheses inserted under optimal conditions. With a greater space of time after the reconstruction the risk of loosening nevertheless increases significantly and this can also be discerned at a relatively early stage. Radiological loosening, in fact, precedes the clinical loosening and can occasionally be seen several years before typical loosening discomfort is experienced by the patient. In view of the doubtful prognosis for cement fixed prostheses in the long term one is generally undisposed to use such replacements in young patients who not only can be expected to need the prosthesis for a very long time but also subject the bone prosthesis relation to greater strain on account of a higher level of activity. It is nevertheless also prior art knowledge to anchor joint replacements without cement. Freeman introduced his technique for cementless fixation of knee prostheses in 1976 and since then other designs such as PCA, Laskin, New Jersey, the Galante prosthesis and others have been presented. It is still all too early to arrive at any conclusions about the results of effects to fix knee joint replacements without bone cement but one may nevertheless dare to assert that there is very little evidence to support lasting unchanged stabilisation of the aforesaid types of prosthesis to underlying bone. All the signs indicate that most, if not all, of the types of prosthesis mentioned hereinbefore appear to be connective tissue anchored, i.e. surrounded by connective tissue that separates the prosthesis from the bone tissue. A connective tissue zone of this nature tends to grow under continued load. This leads to loosening. With regard to the occurrence of such a connective tissue zone, reference may be made to an article by Gerald A Lord et al, An Uncemented Total Hip Replacement , Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research No. 141, June 1979. From the above it is evident that there are several artificial knee joints on the market, but none of these has been shown to establish a long lasting stable anchorage to the host skeleton. An object of the present invention is therefore to achieve an improved knee joint prosthesis giving a solution to several of the problems mentioned hereinbefore and particularly to the problem of fixation. From FR A 2378505 an anchorage device for a joint prosthesis is previously known which comprises one fixture leg which forms a healing surface towards the surrounding bone tissue and a corresponding articulation device comprising connection means for connection of the articulation device to the fixture leg. However, in this case the fixture leg forms a comparatively thick square shaped member which means a problematic installation and big surgical defect in the femoral bone. A further object of the invention is therefore to be able to facilitate the surgical installation and reduce the surgical defect upon prosthetic surgery, i.e. to reduce the removal of intact bone tissue during the operation. Yet a further object of the invention is to be able to extend the indication range, especially for knee prosthetic surgery and to provide a joint replacement material that permits the introduction of artificial knee joints among far younger patients than at the present time. Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the following description. The invention is thus based on the osseointegration principle as previously described by Bra nemark and his colleagues with regard to jaw bone anchored dental bridges. The only implant that hitherto has been demonstrated to remain anchored via direct contact between bone and implant, osseointegration, is in fact Bra nemark s jaw bone anchored dental bridge. The anchorage of these dental bridges is based on the cornerstones of atraumatic insertion technique, anchorage portions of commercially pure titanium, unloaded healing phase of critical length and secondary operation with connection of load portions. The invention is then characterized in that the femoral anchorage device comprises at least two separate fixture screws insertable from the femur joint surface the fixture screws each having an internal thread, and the femoral articulation device comprises an articulatory surface rail part and a separate interconnecting L shaped element connected to said fixture screws by means of locking screws screwed into the internal thread of the fixture screws. A knee joint prosthesis of this kind then normally comprises two parts, namely one for each of the two opposing articulating bone ends in a knee joint, a femoral component and a tibial component. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention each of the parts of the prosthesis comprises such an anchorage device plus a connected articulation device. The articulation devices are then adapted to each other to permit the wanted freedom of movement between the bone ends. The actual articulation devices may have a slightly different design depending on the joint concerned. One part of the prosthesis may be provided with a fixed articulation device of metal with a rounded, more or less anatomically correct articulatory surface as that of the normal femoral condyle while the other adjacent articulatory surface device may consist of a polyethylene component fixed or movably disposed on a metal socket which in turn is connected to the anchorage device of the other part of the prosthesis for instance the tibial component . In an advantageous embodiment at least the anchorage devices are made of commercially pure titanium. Some advantageous embodiments of the invention in conjunction with a knee joint will be described in greater detail below. Through this invention the unreliability of fixation in earlier designs of knee prostheses can be eliminated. The invention gives a metal to bone anchorage of the replacement and in this respect the invention represents a radically new approach. A two seance operation is a prerequisite for lasting anchorage. It also provides an interval for tailoring the articulation device to fit in exactly at the host site which can be three dimensionally defined at the first operation by means of a casting procedure. This combination of operation technique and prosthesis design is completely unique. The invention also offers the advantage that no gross removal of healthy bone has to be performed to create a mechanical interlock between the reshaped skeletal end and the multicornered interior surfaces of a conventional prosthesis. Instead only small amounts of bone have to be removed to replace the joint surfaces with the technique described above. A decisive advantage with the invention is that it affords a possibility for retained skeleton fixation for a long time, which implies that it should be possible to increase the indication range for example for knee joint replacement so that considerably younger patients than at present can be offered this type of solution to their severe knee problems. At the present time, considerable doubts are entertained about inserting knee prostheses in patients less than 60 years of age. Through the solution of the fixation problems afforded by the invention there is justification for the hope that the indication range will be extended to also include patients less than 60 years of age. In the following the invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 6 illustrate a first embodiment and figures 7 11 a second, preferred embodiment. As evident from the preamble, the invention is based on the establishment of a permanent anchorage between the bone tissue in the knee joint and the prosthesis. To permit such a permanent anchorage, so called osseointegration, certain factors must be satisfied, namely atraumatic insertion technique, anchorage devices in a special tissue compatible material such as commercially pure titanium, an unloaded healing phase of critical length and a secondary operation with connection of the wanted replacement portion, i.e. a two seance procedure with an interlying unloaded healing period. As also mentioned in the introduction the osseointegration principle has been previously described in connection with jaw bone anchored dental bridges, see e.g. The implantation of the anchorage portions is performed in such a manner that the prerequisites for osseointegration are satisfied see above . This technique is, as evident from the above, in itself already known and will therefore not be described more closely here. Typical of the invention is that the anchorage devices are implanted in such a manner that the defective joint surface is left almost entirely intact at the first operation, i.e. the surgical defect is limited to only what is required for implantation of the anchorage devices. The patient remains mobile during the healing phase which is a condition for a functional joint. The anchorage devices can be operated in from the joint surface itself. It is true that the joint surface is interfered with, but this damage is so limited that it does not appreciably deteriorate the function of the joint during the healing phase. As the articulation portions are not connected during the healing phase it will be realized that the anchorage devices are not subjected to load during this phase. First during a second operation, which is carried out roughly 3 4 months after the first one, are the articulation portions coupled to the tibia and femur. During this procedure bone has to be removed to make room for the articulatory surface replacements. Illustrated in Fig. 1 is an example of anchorage devices for the tibia, partly a unicondylar 1a and a bicondylar version 1b , and which is arranged to be inserted from the front. The unicondylar anchorage device consists of and extended cylindrical rod 1 fitted with a side portion 2. The upper surface of the rod 1 is planed off and provided with an anchorage mechanism in the form of a dove tailed recess 3 which extends along the planed off side of the rod facing towards the surface of the joint and which is to permit connection from the front of the articulation device of the tibia. The side portion 2 is also provided with an anchoring mechanism in the form of the screw hole 4 for locking of the articulation device. The bicondylar anchorage device, see Fig. 1b, consists of two rod shaped anchorage portions which are interconnected with a disk shaped portion 5. It is also evident from Fig. 1b that the angle α between the anchorage portion and the interconnection portion 5 slightly exceeds 90 which is occasioned by the contour of the tibial condyles. The anchorage device for the tibia is also made of commercially pure titanium and arranged to be implanted in the tibia in a first operation so that an osseointegration takes place. Only after a healing phase of 3 4 months is are the articulation device or devices for the tibia connected. Here, the devices differ from one another medially and laterally since an artificial meniscus is inserted on the medial side in the joint for improved congruence. Laterally, there is no meniscus, the articulation portion then being provided with an anchorage mechanism for a solid polyethylene component with a slightly dished tibial condyle which leads directly to a rounded femoral condyle. Laterally, the joint is thus non constrained. The medial articulation portion is illustrated in Fig. 2 and consists in principle of a segment shaped metal socket 6 the upper surface of which is ground smooth and has a running groove in the form of two guide tracks 7 for steering of the artificial meniscus, Fig. 2b, and its lower surface, which faces towards the anchorage device, is also flat but has a connection piece in the form of a dove tailed rail 8 adapted to the recess 3 in the anchorage device and a screw hole 9 adapted to the hole 4 in the side portion of the anchorage device, see Fig. 2a. In the same way as the other devices, the articulation device of the tibia is preferably made of commercially pure titanium. In conjunction with Figs 1 and 2 the constructed design of the tibial component with its anchorage device and articulation device has now been illustrated. Shown in Figs 3 and 4 is how the two seance procedure is applied to the tibial component both unicondylarly and bicondylarly. Fig. 3 then shows the condition after the first operation with the anchorage devices inserted, seen partly from the articulation surface Fig. 3a and 3b and partly from the front Fig. 3c and 3d . Here too, the surgical defect is, as may be seen, very limited and the articulation surfaces of the tibia are completely intact apart from the recess 10 for a fixture 11 which is connected to the side portion of the anchorage device. Shown in Fig. 4 is the condition after the second operation, the end contour of the tibia being shown from the front after surgical removal of the end contour of the tibia which is necessary to make room for the articulation device replacement in the form of a metal socket and meniscus medially and of a flat non mobile tibial bearing component of polyethylene laterally. The metal socket is pushed onto the anchorage portion to the end position of the steering groove and fixed by means of a screw in the fixture. The metal socket is thus firmly anchored and is unable to move in any direction. Illustrated in Fig. 5 is the complete tibial component with connected meniscus medially in a view partly from the front Fig. 5 and partly from the articulatory surface Fig. 5b . As evident from Fig. 5 the outer contours of both the socket 6 and the meniscus agree with the end contour of the removed tibial condyle. The meniscus is nevertheless somewhat smaller so that it is able to move unobstructedly over the socket 6. In the following a second, preferred embodiment will be described with reference to Figures 6 10. Illustrated in Fig. 6 is an anchorage device for the femur which consists of titanium fixture screws 12 separately anchored into the bone tissue through an external screw thread. The fixtures are a further development of the fixtures developed by P I Bra nemark for dental bridges, but has been adapted to the specific requirements which must be satisfied for a knife joint. For reliable anchorage of the articulation device at least two fixture screws will usually be required, to which the articulation device will subsequently be connected. The placing of the fixtures is done very accurately with the aid of aligning instruments. The fixture screws 12 are made of commercially pure titanium. The fixture screws are tubular with an external thread which forms a healing surface against the bone tissue and an internal thread for connecting the articulation device. Figure 7 illustrates the corresponding articulation device for the femoral component, which in this case consists of two separate parts, an articulatory surface rail part 13, which has an L shaped socket 14, and an interconnecting L shaped element 15. Also the articulatory surface rail is anatomically designed and consists of commercially pure titanium. The interconnecting element 15 is connected to the fixture screws 12 by means of two locking screws 16 which are screwed into the tubular fixtures 12. The interconnecting element 15 has three further holes for locking the articulatory surface rail part 13, one hole 16a which is parallel to the fixture screws and two holes 17, 18 on the shorter angled part of the element which holes are perpendicular to the fixture screws. The articulatory surface socket 14 has corresponding guiding pins 19, 20, 21 for securing the articulation device in a plane parallel to the fixture screws as well as in a perpendicular plane. One of the guiding pins 20, 21 on the shorter angled socket part then being conical and the guiding pin 19 being spring actuated for locking the articulatory surface rail part 13 to the interconnecting element 15. Even in this embodiment the two seance procedure is applied to the femoral component. In a first operation the fixture screws 12 are implanted into one or each of the femoral condyles. In this operation there is only a limited surgical defect in the form of two drill holes. Only at the second operation seance, after the healing phase, is a removal 22 of the end contour of the femur carried out for adaption of the interconnecting element 15, see Fig. 8. The removal is effectuated by means of the fixture screws as references and is carried out down to the fixture screw ends so that there is a plane perpendicular to the fixtures. There is also a removal 13 in a perpendicular plane at the back of the femoral condyle to provide the base for the L shaped interconnecting element 15. The width of the removal is adapted to the width of the socket 14 of the articulatory surface rail part. Figure 8 is a section through an assembled femoral component illustrating the different parts, specifically also the guiding pin 19 actuated by means of a spring 24. The femoral component is entirely secured to the femur and can be removed only by destructing the articulatory surface. Illustrated in Fig. 9 is also a further embodiment of the tibia component based on two titanium fixture screws, one lateral 25 and one medial 26, as an anchorage device. The fixture screws are inserted from the front in a first operation so that an osseointegration takes place, see Fig. 9a. After a healing phase of 3 4 months the articulation device for the tibia is connected to the two titanium screws after a surgical removal of the end contour of the tibia to make room for the articulation device. Like the fixture screws in the femur, the tibial fixture screws 25 and 26 are also made of commercially pure titanium. The screws are tubular with an external thread which forms a healing surface against the bone tissue. The screws are smooth drilled internally and provided with a longitudinal slit 27 for the connection of the tibia articulation device. A medial, unicondylar articulation device is illustrated in Fig. 9b, seen from the front, and in Fig. 9c, seen from the articulation surface. The articulation device is connected to the titanium fixture screws and comprises a medial segment shaped metal socket 28, one cross beam 29 and two solid, cylindrical guiding rods 30, 31 inserted into the fixture screws. The articulation device is made as a single unit, preferably of commercially pure titanium. The medial guiding rod 31 is connected to the lower surface of the socket 28 by means of a longitudinal beam extending through the slit 27 in the titanium screw 26. Any torsional moment on the medial tibia socket 28 is compensated by the lateral fixture screw 25 via said cross beam 29. Figs. 9b and c illustrate a unicondylar version. It should be understood, however, that a bicondylar version is based on the same principle. In this case there is a medial as well as a lateral segment shaped metal socket connected by a cross beam. Each of the sockets are then connected to its guiding rod through a longitudinal, vertical beam extending through the fixture screw slit. Fig. 10 illustrates in different views a modified, unicondylar tibia component which is also based on titanium fixture screws as an anchorage device. In this case a tubular fixture screw 32, like screw 26, is inserted from the front in the first operation so that an osseointegration takes place. Only after the healing phase of 3 4 months there is a surgical removal of the end contour of the tibia to make room for the articulation device in the form of a flat metal socket 35 provided with a cylindrical, solid rod 33 connected to the socket via a longitudinal, vertical beam 34. The fixture screw 32 is used as an aligning reference during the surgical removal. The end contour of the tibia is removed to such an extent that there is a certain pretension between the socket 35 and the underlying bone tissue surface. As in this case there is only one transverse fixture screw 32 it might be necessary to provide the socket with an additional, peripheral vertical screw 36 inserted in the second operation to compensate for any torsional moment. The metal socket 35 is provided with an artificial meniscus 37 of polyethylene movably disposed on the plane upper surface of the tibia metal socket. The magnitude of the movement backwards is limited by a posterior edge 38 on the socket as illustrated in Fig. 10b. The invention is not limited to the embodiment described above but can be varied within the scope of the accompanying claims.
