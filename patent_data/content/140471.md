## Description
DISPOSA LE URI ARY AIID PECAL 7.ASTE CONTAI ENT PRflDI1CT BACKC,ROU lD OF HF Ir vE 1 Ior. The present invention relates to an entirely new concept of providing a disposable urinary and fecal waste containnent product. the product is particularly suitable for active adults and contains adult discharges of urine and fecal waste. The product has a high liquid impact capacity, high liquid retention, contains fecal waste without leakage and allows the skin of the wearer to remain Arv. disposable absorbent products have been known for some tine, including such products as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, wound dressings, bandages, incontinent pads, adult diaper and urinary containment products, and the like. these products incornorate an absorbent batt which is used to absorb and hold or contain body fluids. Initiallyr in manv of these products, especially diapers and sanitary napkins, the absorbent batt comprised what is termed wadding or plies of tissue. The wadding was disposed between a liquid imperneable backing and a liquid perneable facing and the plies of tissue were used to absorb and, hopefully, contain the liquid within the product. A diaper which utilizes such an absorbent batt is disclosed in U.S. Reissue Patent No. 26,151.The wadding type of product was replaced, for the most part, by an improved absorbent batt which comprises what is termed fluffed woodpulp fibers . This absorbent batt comprises a layer of individualized woodpulp fibers with the layer having substantial thickness. A diaper which incorporates such a fluffed woodpulp absorbent batt is described in U..S. Patent tlo. 2,78 ,OO3. This diaper had improved absorbent capacity and somewhat better containnent than a diaper using a wadding layer. Also, the fluffed woodpulp layer is quite soft, flexible, and conformable, and, hence, produces an improved diaper over diapers using waddinq as the absorbent layer.Though the fluffed woodpulp absorbent batts have improved capacity, the efficiency with which the capacity is used in a diaper or sanitary napkin is poor. The reason for this is that the fluid to be absorbed is generally deposited in a localized area within the absorbent batt, and the ability of the fluid to nove along the plane of the batt is poor. The fluid tends to follow a radial wicking path and consequently novels to the closest edge of the batt where it generally is no longer contained and the product leaks. U.S. Patent Ilo. 3,017,304 discloses an absorbent product which incorporates in the product a densified paper like layer. This paper like layer acts as a wic , i.e., liquid which is placed on the layer tends to move rapidly along the plane of the layer. When incorporated in conbination with fluffed woodpulp fiber, the resultant product uses the absorbent capacity of the fluffed woodpulp much nore efficiently.Diapers which incorporate this paperlike layer combined with fluffed woodpulp are disclosed and described in U.,. Patent lilos. 3,612,055 and 3,938,522. This concept of conbining wicking ability, or a capillary skin or layer, with fluffed woodpulp fibers has gained wide acceptance in many absorbent products including disposable diapers and sanitary napkins. Even though these products make much greater use of the capacity of the absorbent batt, they still do not totally contain the absorbed liquid. It is probable that these products will leak before the full capacity of the batt is used for the absorption or, at the very least, before the entire liquid void by the user is absorbed. This is especially true when pressure is placed on the batt while wet.For example, a baby sitting down on a previously wetted diaper will very often cause the batt to leak.An incontinent adult faces not only the problems of the infant but many other problens. First, the void of an adult generally is much higher in volume than that of an infant. Second, a bulge under clothing is accepted by society for an infant, but the ambulatory adult with an incontinence problem longs for a product which is not visible through ordinary clothing. Third, the proportions and shape of the legs and torso of the adult differs considerably from those of an infant. Therefore, a mere enlargement of an infant diaper, such as that shown inU.S. Patent 4,253,461 is not a satisfactory product.In the adult incontinent product marketplace, a product is needed which has a large storage capacity and which..will also retain fecal waste matter. such containers have been suggested, however these containers have been substantially rigid, have a tendency to dislodge and not be in the proper position and are quite uncomfortable. A product with a substantially large capacity with an ability to move liquid away from the void zone which is disposable, which is comfortable and which does not substantially show through wearing apparel is needed in the marketplace.A number of years ago, tsuperabsorbent materials , i.e., materials which will absorb many tines their weight of liquid, were developed. Since the development of such materials, attempts to incorporate then in absorbent products such as diapers to enhance the absorption perfornance of these products have been made. Theoreticalls, a mininun amount of superabsorbent incorporate in a product would make that product perform as well or better than the prior art products. Perhaps one of the first products to incorporate such a superabsorbent gated rial in a disposable diaper is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,670,31. This patent discloses an absorbent dressing comprising an absorbent layer sandwiched between a perneable facing and an impermeable hacking sheet.The absorbent layer contains water insoluble cross linked hydrocolloid polymer as the superabsorbent material.Even though superabsorbent materials have been available for some tine, they have not gained wide acceptance in absorbent products such as disposable diapers, and sanitary napkins. A primary reason for this lack of acceptance of superabsorbents is failure to develop a product capable of econonically utilizing the highly increased absorptive capacity of the superabsorbent material. In order to econonically utilize a superabsorbent, the liquid being absorbed must be readily accepted and placed in contact with the superabsorbent material. Furthernore, as the superabsorbent material absorbs liquid, it must be allowed to swell. If the superabsorbent is prevented from swelling, it will cease absorbing liquid. Hence, if the superabsorbent material is to function in absorbent products, such as diapers and sanitary napkins, wherein the liquid to be absorbed is placed in a small void area, the structure of the absorbent layer containing superabsorbent materials must have certain characteristics. Over the years, a number of techniques have been disclosed in an attempt to provide structures which make efficient use of the superabsorbent naterial. Such products are disclosed inU.S. Patent tWos. 4,103,062 4,102,340 and 4,235,237. In addition, methods for incorporating superabsorbents into suitable layers or suitable configurations which can be placed in an absorbent product, are disclosed in U.S.Patent flows. 4,186,165 4,3A0,057 and 4,364,992. To date, none of these products has net with any substantial connercial success.the present invention provides an entirely new disposable urinary and fecal waste containment product which possesses a large storage capacity which is soft and confortable, which can be designed so as not to be particularly apparent through normal clothing and which utilizes a substantial portion of the absorptive capacity of superabsorbent materials. In addition, the new absorbent product will contain absorbed liquid and deposited fecal waste matter even when pressure is placed upon the product during use. SU 1 l R OF THF I 7F TIO 1 The present invention provides a disposable urinarv and fecal waste containnent product. This product comprises a liquid nerneable substantially flexible shell having a depth of at least about 0.25 and having a front urinary portion and a rear fecal portion. The front portion generallv is narrower and has an area less than 70 of the area of the rear portion. the front portion has a first super structure placed in and substantially filling the front portion of the shell. It also has an absorbent medium which is in intimate contact with at least a portion of the superstructure. The sunerstructure is at least slightly compressible and capable of maintaining a void volume of liquid.The superstructure is selected from the group consisting of a fibrous web, a foam, entangled resilient fibers and mixtures thereof. The rear portion has a second superstructure which also is placed in and substantially fills the rear portion of the shell.This superstructure is at least slightly conpressible and has three dinensional characteristics which prevent movement of the fecal matter across the surface. It is selected from a group consisting of a fibrous web, an open celled foan, a fibrous pile structure, entangled resilient fibers, sliver knit, malivlieves, split corrugated web, tufted yarn, dimensioned needle punch or mixtures thereof.The second superstructure is secured in the rear portion of the shell.The shell is formed from a moldable substance which is liquid imperneable, is soft and flexible but when deformed by pressure returns substantially to its original configuration. For example, the shell may be a polyethylene foam shell which is formed fron a blown polyethvlene foam sheet which is subsequently subjected to molding by a thermal process.The shell generally has a boat like shape and ranges in thickness from about 1 64 to about 1 4 in thickness. mhe shell has a length which ranges from about 9 to about 22 . The width in the front portion measured fron one rim to another across the top space is from about 2 to about 7 and the width for the rear portion measured in the same manner is from about 3 to about 12 in the widest portion. The depth of the shell measured from a line extending across the width of the shell rim to the deepest portion across the width is at least .25 up to about 2 . The first superstructure, which is placed in the front portion of the shell, in one embodiment is a carded nonwoven web formed from a resilient fiber such as polyester.The web is corrugated and stabilized to prevent the corrugations from separating or flattening when the web is wet and has pressure placed upon it.The second superstructure placed in the rear portion of the shell is generally comprised of fibers which are substantially in the z direction as opposed to the x y plane. In one embodiment the corrugated web provided for the front portion is stabilized on both sides and is then slit horizontally 4 nlough the web to provide a pile like open web structure. This pile like structure provides sufficient friction to retain the fecal waste matter so that it does not tend to migrate out the side of the product.The absorbent medium placed in the front portion and optionally in the rear portion, is superabsorbent material, hydrophilic fibers, which are loosely compacted or formed into a nonwoven web, wadding, tissue, peat moss, mixtures thereof or the like.In a specific embodiment of the present invention, a liquid permeable fabric or web covers the open side of the front portion of the product. This cover or facing is sealed to the rim of the shell thereby entrapping the first superstructure and the absorbent medium whichthaxte been placed in the front portion of the shell. It should be pointed out that the front portion and rear portion of the shell are separated by a liquid impermeable barrier.If the urinary front portion does not have a facing or covering, the superstructure and, if necessary, the absorbent medium are affixed to the shell so as to remain in position even when wet. The second superstructure in the rear portion of the shell is preferably left open but is in any event secured in the shell so as to remain in position even when waste matter is deposited thereon.Optionally, the second superstructure may have associated therewith an absorbent medium as described above.The product of the present invention has a high innact capacity, i.e., the product receives and retains a relatively large quantity of liquid. Furthermore, the product does not leak or spill over. In other words, once liquid enters the product it remains entrapped within the product. The product also maintains its surface dry thereby keeping moisture away from the skin of the wearer. till further, the product retains fecal waste matter thus keeping it fron the clothing of the wearer. Also the product of the present invention permits air circulation in the region where the product is worn resulting in a high degree of comfort.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF HF.

DF.TAlLFD DE.SCRIPtIOtl OF It VElXmIO2 Figure 1 is a perspective view of a disposable urinary and fecal waste containment product 10 which has a polyethylene ethv lvinyl acetate foam shell 12 containing in the rear portion 14 a split portion of the corrugated web 11 and a sunerabsorbent containing fibrous web 13.The split corrugated web 11 and the superabsorbent containing web 13 are secured to the foam shell 12 in the rear portion 14 of the product. There is a segment of foam shell 18 which separates the front portion 16 from the rear portion 14. Contained in the front portion 16 of the shell is a corruqated web 15 which will be described in further detail later.The front portion 16 of the product 10 is covered by a liquid perneable facing 17 which is adhered to the rim 18 of the shell 12, thus the urinary pad portion 16 is secured within the shell 19. At least the rear portion 14 of the shell has a lip 19 formed so that the side wall extends inwardly and then outwardly to form the lip 19. when the user applies pressure on the lip, the confiquration of the side wall prevents the side from tilting outwardlv thereby preventing any leakage.The lenqth of the product J1 as shown in Figure 1 ranges from about 9 to about 22 . The length of the urinary portion L2 of the product ranges from about 4 to about 12 . The width of the rear portion 14 of the product is from about 3 to about 12 , whereas the width of the front portion of the product identified as W2 is from about 2 to about 7 . The widths of the front and rear portions are somewhat proportional to the length, that is, if the length is approaching 22 of the overall product, then the widths will be approaching 12 and 7 , whereas the lengthL2 also increases as the overall length of the product increases.Figure ln depicts in a perspective view another embodiment of the product lOA which has a urinary pad Portion 16A which is readily detachable from the shell 12A as shown inFigure 1A. The shell portion lSA for the urinary pad is formed of the sane foam as the shell 12A. This foam is a polyethylene ethylvinyl acetate liquid impermeable foam.Generally the foam shell ranges from about 1 64 to about l ss thick. The shell is preformed by a thermal molding process known in the art. The depth of the shell is at least about 1 4 and preferably from 1 2 to 1 . The depth of the shell for the urinary portion may he as deep as 2 .The depth of the shell is measured by placing a line across from one rim to another and measuring the deepest point across that line.Figure 2 is a perspective view of the underside of the shell. Jssongitudinal indentations 24 placed in the rear portion of the shell assist in permitting the exterior of the shell to expand slightly when pressure is placed upon it by the wearer s sitting on the product. mhe front portion of the shell 28 in this embodiment is provided with adhesive strips 21 which are protected by a release strip 23 which is removed prior to asplication of the product to the underclothing of the wearer. The shell 2O is liquid impermeable, flexible, preferably soft and is molded generally by a thermal molding process from. substances such as polyethylene, polypropylene, poly butylene, urethra f anus, styrofoam, etc. Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of a portion of a typical corrugated web 30 used in the front portion or urinary pad portion of the product of the present invention. This portion 30 of the web shows the web 34 in a corruqated form wherein superabsorbent 32 has been placed among the fibers of the web. The web has been stabilized by thermal bondinq of fusible fibers 36 which are in the blend of fibers forning the web 34.Figure 4 depicts a cross sectional view of another portion 40 of another corrugated web 42 suitable for use in the present invention. The corruqated web 42 is a fibrous web but does not contain any superabsorbent within the web fibers. Instead the superabsorhent 44 is placed between the corrugation folds of the web. Thus, as the webaccepts and retains a void volume of liquid the liquid is readily in contact with the superabsorbent. The corrugated web 42 is stabilized by a thin coating of adhesive 46 placed on one side of the corrugated web 42. The corrugated web 42 would he placed in urinary pad which is the front portion of the present invention with the open corrugations toward the facing surface.Figure 5 is a cross sectional view in still another portion 50 of a corrugated web 52. This corrugated web 52 contains two layers 54 and 56. the layer 54 is a fibrous layer which has a lower capillary pressure than the second layer 56. A corrugated web 52 is stabilized by fusible fibers 58 which when the web is exposed to a temperature which substantially melts these fibers the corrugations in the web are fused together at least partially. Figure 6 depicts an open cell foam 60 substantially rectangular in shape which can be placed in the front urinary pad section of the product of the present invention.Figure 7 is a cross sectional view of a fraction 70 of styrofoam beads 72 which forms the superstructure placed in the shell of the urinary pad portion of the present invention. These styrofoam beads 72 are placed in the shell so as to substantially fill the shell.Figure 8 is a perspective view of a multi layer web structure 80 wherein the first layer. 82 is of a lower density than is the second layer 84 and the second layer 84 is of.a lower density than is the third layer 86. This multi layered fibrous web would be placed in the shell of the urinary pad portion of the present product so that the first fibrous layer 82 is in contact with the facing. The rear portion of the product of the present invention identified as portion 14 requres a different kind of superstructure from that used in the urinarv pad portion.The superstructure of the fecal waste portion is at least slightly compressible and is capable of maintaining a small liquid void volume even when wet but it also requires that a pile like formation of fibers is used so as to provide sufficient surface friction to retard migration of fecal matter across the pad surface. In accordance therewith, in Figure 9, a cross sectional view of a section of corruqated web 90 is depicted. The web 92 is generally a fibrous web such as a polyester web which has been corrugated and stabilized typically by use of adhesives 94 on both sides of the web. The web is then split along 9A 9A and the web appears as is depicted inFigure 9A. In Figure 9A a portion of corrugated web 90A is provided which has been s ilized by adhesive 94A. The portions of corrugated fibers 92A provide a tufted pile like surface which is suitable to prevent migration of fecal matter when fecal matter is deposited thereon.Likewise in Figure 10 a suitable needle punch pile like fabric is provided wherein the substrate 102 either a scrim or batt of fibers contains fibers 104 which have been secured in the substrate 102 by a needle punch action. Thus, this fragment of product 100 is suitable for use in the rear portion of the product of the present invention.The liquid impermeable substantially flexible shell is formed from a moldable substance. The substance when molded should provide a liquid impermeable, substantially flexible shell with a thickness ranging from about l 64 inch to about 1 4 inch. The shell when deformed should substantially return to its original shape. Substances which provide these characteristics and which are moldable by pressure, or thermal molding, or the like, are suitable. Particularly suitable for use in the present invention is a polyethylene containing foam.The polyethylene containing foam shell is prepared by known thermal molding processing. The preferred formulation for forming the polyethylene containing foam material is identified as Volara, which is a polyethylene ethylvinyl acetate blend. The product is manufactured and sold by Voltek, Inc., Lawrence, Massachusetts. Preferably, the formulation is prepared in sheet form at approximately 1 8 in thickness. The sheet is subjected to thermal molding at a temperature of about 260to to form the foam shell. The shell is boat like in shape, but is not limited thereto. The length of the shell ranges from about 9 inches to about 22 inches, with a width from about 2 inches to about 7 inches in the front portion and about 3 to about 12 in the rear portion. The thickness of the shell ranges from about 1 64 to about 1 4 .The depth of the shell is measured by extending a line horizontally from one rim to another in the center of the front or rear portion. The depth is then measured from that line to the base of the foam shell on the longitudinal axis. This depth ranges from about 0.25 to about 2.0 . The foam shell nay be made of other suitable compositions, which are soft and flexible and are liquid impermeable. The superstructure of the front portion urinary portion may be comprised of one or more fibrous webs, a foam or one or more layers of foam, resilient fibers which are entangled, or mixtures thereof, or the like. A fibrous web aenerally is formed from svnthetic fibers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, polyamide fibers, hi conponent fibers, copolymers thereof, mixtures thereof and the like. However, cellulosic fibers such as rayon nay also be used. he fibers are placed in the web by known means such as by carding to form a web which is then stabilized if needed.Stabilization may he achieved by heat through bonding, adhesive bonding, point embossing with heat or adhesive or both , needle punching, use of water jets and the like. The stabilizing process is selected according to the fibers used and the process used to form the web. Other suitable procedures for forming a web include air laying, wet laying, spun bonding, laying of melt blown fibers, spread tow, and other known techni ques. A typically suitable web has a dry bulk of at least about lfl cc gm and a weight less than about 4 oz yd2.In a preferred embodiment, a fibrous web is corruqated and stabilized so as to prevent loss of corrugation when the fibrous web becomes wet. Corrugating or transverse folding of the we nay be carried out by procedures such as that in U.S. Patent 4,111,733. Generally, the web corrugations will range from about 3 to 6 or even 8 per inch of corrugated web, and the web thickness will he from about 1 4 to about 3 , preferably from about 1 2 to about 1 1 2 thick. One method of stabilizing the corrugations in the web is accomplished by using an adhesive which may be a latex binder or other known adhesive. The corrugated web is sprayed with the adhesive on one corrugated surface thereof, or if desired on both corrugated surfaces. The adhesive is cured and the web thus stabilized.Another method of stabilizing the web is by adding a small portion of fusible fibers to the web fibers before or after the web is made. These fusible fibers have a lower melting point than the remaininq fibers and when the corrugated web is subjected to temperatures sufficient to melt the fusible fibers, liqht bonding is provided between the corrugations.In one specific embodiment, a blend of staple polyester fibers with a minor portion of fusible fibers such as lower melt polyester fibers are carded to form. a web.The web is subsequently lightly bonded by passing hot air through the fibers making the fusible fibers tacky so as to stick to each other and the staple fibers to provide the desired degree of integrity to the corrugated web structure.Fibrous webs may be used in the urinary portion in noncorrugated form as well. For instance, a high loft, low density, stable fibrous web may be placed in the shell and either adhered to the shell wall or provided with a facing covering the web to provide a satisfactory urinary pad.If the desired thickness is not available in the web, nore than one layer of the web may be used but preferably the capillary pressure provided by each weL layer increases as the layers are placed away from the facing. In an example with three layers of fibrous webs, the top layer, that is the layer closest to the open side of the shell, has the lowest capillary pressure, the mid layer has a higher capillary pressure than the first layer but a lower capillary pressure than the third and last layer.What appears to be only a small difference in capillary pressure is all that is required for one layer to attract and drain liquid from an adjacent layer. The force causing a liquid to enter a cylindrical capillary is expressed by the equation P 2v cos e r wherein the force is represented by the capillary pressure andP is the capillary pressure, M is the surface tension of the liquid, 6 is the liquid fiber contact angle, and r is the capillary radius. with a given liquid, the pressure capillary force increases with the cosine of the liquid fiber contact angle reaching a maximum where the angle is zero and also increases with narrower capillary radii so that narrower capillaries will draw liquid from wider ones.The relative wickability between a first fibrous layer and a second layer is affected by both the relative densities of the layers and the relative wettability of the individual fibers in each layer. The individual fibers of the second layer preferably have substantially smaller liquid fiber contact angles than those of the first fibrous la overcoming the density difference and providing a significdnt overall increase in capillary pressure to absorb liquid into the second layer.The fibers of the second layer of fibers and any subsequent layer of fibers or particles and or the density of the layer are selected to create a significant difference in capillary pressure from the first fibrous layer.The second fibrous or particle layer is generally com prised of fibers having a lower liquid contact angle or wherein the layer is provided with a narrower capillary radii. examples of such fibers include hydrophilic fibers such as rayon fibers, cellulosic fibers, or peat moss, or mixtures thereof, or acrylic fibers, or the like. Cellulosic fibers include wood pulp fibers, cotton linters and the like.The wood pulp fibers generally are those that are used to form the fluff or fibrous batt layer in conventional absorbent products such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, etc. Other cellulosic fibers that night be used are rayon fibers, flax, hemp, jute, ramie, cotton, and the like. The fiber, or peat moss, or mixtures thereof are placed in such a way as to form a layer in which the particles are close to one another so as to promote wicking of liquid in the plane of the layer.The second laxer can be preformed and placed next to the first fibrous layer or, the particles fibers or peat floss or mixtures thereof can be air laid or wet laid, or otherwise combined with the first fibrous layer before any transverse foldinq or corrugating takes place. The multiple layer structure may be corrugated or simply used in its multiple layer form in ttse urinary portion.Another material suitable for making the superstructure of the urinary portion is a foam. The foam should be slightly compressible, reasonablsr flexible, and must he able to maintain a void volume, i.e., hold liquid reasonably when wet. The foam needs to be in a form that allows liquid to enter the entire foam structure and at the same time has at least some collapse resistance sufficient to maintain the void volume of the foam. z foan tvpe structure which in its unaltered form that is not satisfactory is a sponge. Although a sponge does have the collapse resistance and has the necessary void volume, a sponge tends not to provide adequate impact capacity.In other words, the liquid upon initial contact is not immediately entrapped in the void volume space. However, if a sponge is chopped up into pieces or if holes are put into the sponge, so as to permit the liquid to enter a void space initially, the sponge will perform satisfactorily.The foam may be placed in the front portion of the shell in sheet form whereupon if the sheet is sufficiently thick, only one is required, but if lavered it is preferable that there be a capillary difference between the layers as discussed hereinbefore. The foam may be placed in the shell in chopped pieces or perhaps in the form of beads such as styrofoam beads. The foam may be thick and cast into the shell so as to form fit the shell.Suitable foams include polyurethane foams, polystyrene foams, and the like.Entangled fibers may he used to provide the superstructure. These fibers should be resilient and have sufficient denier to provide the adequate void volune within the foan shell. The fibers may be frictionally entangled or oths ise entangled so as to provide the necessary void volume. Typical of fibers suitable for use are synthetic fibers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, nylon, hi component fibers, copolymers thereof, mixtures thereof and the like, or cellulosic fibers such as rayon fibers, and acrylic fibers.The superstructure for the urinary portion is selected so as to provide sufficient void volume to hold a normal liquid void and impact capacity to receive the liquid rapidly enough to prevent a run off. Also, the superstructure should retain the liquid even under normal pressure such as that provided by the wearer of the pad when sitting down or moving the legs thereby compressing the urinary pad.The first superstructure, i.e., the one nrovided for in the urinary pad portion, has been described in detail.roost of these superstructures will work as the second superstructure, i.e., the one for the fecal waste containnent portion of the product. Powever, it has been found that a superstructure which is fibrous having a pile like structure is particularly desirable. t pile like fibrous structure is obtained by providing a corrugated fibrous web stabilizing the web on both exterior sides of the web and then slitting the web as shown in Figure DA through the central portion of the corrugated web to provide a pile like fibrous structure. Other suitable fibrous structures include needle punch structures, sliver knit, malivlieves, tufted yarn, structure dimensioned needlepunch and the like.If it appeared desirable a facing could be placed over the superstructure of the fecal waste containment portion. over, generally it is preferred to retain the surface area of the pilea e superstructure for provision of the friction sufficient to prevent migration of the fecal waste matter. If a facing or covering is provided over the superstructure in the rear portion of the present product, the facing will be adhered to the rim of the shell so that the superstructure remains in place.If a facing or covering is not used then the superstructure should be secured in the shell so that even when wet the superstructure remains in place in the shell. secured ment can be acheived by thermal bonding, application of adhesive, and the like.The superstructure provided for the rear portion of the product need not provide the high liquid retention characteristics of the urinary portion of the product.However, it is desirable in the rear portion of the product to provide sone liquid retention characteristics so that any liquid waste associated with the fecal waste is readily received and retained in the product. In conjunction therewith, nod pulp fibers and other cellulosic materials such as those discussed in the urinary pad portion are suitable to use. A foam portion or a sponge like portion placed beneath the superstructure would assist in liquid retention. Any suitable means of retaining liquid at the base of the superstructure is satisfactory for use in the fecal waste containment portion of the present product. One means of providing an increase in the liquid capacity of the product whether it be the urinary portion or the fecal waste containment portion is the placement of superabsorbent in intimate contact with at least a portion of the superstructure.The superabsorbent, present either on the fibers of a web or placed in the folds of a corrugated web, or othenzise associated with the void volume portion of the superstructure, is generally a water insoluble, water swellahie polymeric substance capable of absorbing water in an amount which is at least 10 tines the weight of the substance in its dry form. The superabsorbent is in the form of fibers, spheres, particles, hits of f i 1 m globules, webs, filn or the like, or may he applied in the form of a liquid monomer solution which is subsequently polymerized.The superabsorbent prepared by polymerization of a monomer solution placed on fibers in a web is most frequently in the form of globules and bits of filmlike particles in the web structure.One type of superabsorbent material provides particles or fibers which laay be described chemically as having a backbone of natural or synthetic polymers with hydrophilic groups or polymers containing hydrophilic groups being chemically bonded to the backbone or an intimate mixture therewith. Included in this class of materials are such modified natural and regenerated polymers as polysac charides, including for example, cellulose and starch and regenerated cellulose which are modified by being carboxyalkylated, phosphonoalkylated, sulfoalkylated, or phosphorylated to render then highly hydrophilic. Such modified polymers may also be cross linked to improve their water insolubilitv.These same polysaccharides may also serve, for example, as the backbone on to which other polymer moieties may be bonded by graft copolynerization techniques. Such grafted polysaccharides and their method of manufacture are described in tl.S. Patent rlo. 4,109,033 to Chatterjee et al. and nay be described as polysaccharide chains having grafted thereon a hydrophilic chain of the general formula EMI22.1 wherein A and B are selected from the group consisting of OR3, 0 alkali metal , OHNH3, NH2, wherein R1, Rê, and R3 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkylene having 1 to 4 or more carbon atoms wherein r is an integer having a value of C to about 5000 or more, s is an integer having a value of 0 to about 5000 or nore, r plus s is at least 500, p is an integer having a value of o or 1, and q is an integer having a value of 1 to 4. mhe preferred hydrophilic chains are hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile chains and copolymers of polyacrylamide and polysodiun acrylate.In addition to the modified natural and regenerated polymers, the hvdrocolloid component flay comprise wholly synthetic hydrophilic particles. Examples of those now known in the art are polyacrylonitrile fibers which may be modified by grafting noieties thereon such as polyvinylalcohol chains, polyvinyl alcohol itself, hydrophilic polyurethane, poly alkyl phosphonates , partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamides e.g., poly fl N dimethylacrylarnide , sulfonated polystyrene, or a class of poly alkyleneoxide . These highly hydrophilic synthetic polymers may be nodified by other chemical treatments such as cross linking or hydrolysis. Further examples known in the art are the non ionic polymers such as polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene, and mixtures thereof which have been suitablv cross linked, either chemically or by irradiation. Still another nore recent type is a derivative of isobutylenenalic and acrylate monomers, such as sodium, potassium, annonium, or a combination of cations , acrylate, may be placed on the absorbing layer by spraying or otherwise placing a solution thereon, followed by polymerization ani cross linking, for example, by irradiation.In addition, naturally occurring materials such as gums may be used. Examples of such suitable guns include guar guns, acacia gums, locust bean guns and the like.The superabsorbent may be placed in the botton of the shell prior to the placing of the superstructure in the shell or it may he a part of the superstructure. If the superstructure is a fibrous web having substantially uniform density throughout, the superabsorbent is best placed between the fibrous web and the inside surface of the shell. Another alternative method of placing superabsorbent on or within a fibrous web, is by spraying a monomer solution on the fibrous web or perhaps even saturating the web with a monomer solution followed by polymerization and cross linking of the monomer. One typical way to polymerize the monomer is by use of irradiat ion.This places the superabsorbent substantially evenly throughout the fibrous web and affixes the superabsorbent in such a manner that the superabsorbent globules or particles are within a void volume sufficient to permit them to swell substantially to completion.If the web is corrugated or transversely folded, superabsorbent can be placed within the folds provided it is sufficiently associated with the void volume that the swelling of the superabsorbent can occur. If the web is a multiple layer web, it is desirable to associate the superabsorbent with the web having the highest capillary pressure. Another concept is the placement of superabsorbent in a pre established situation, such as within a moisture perneable bag to form a packet, or a pocket, or the like. If the superabsorbent is in the form of granules, it may be desirable to moisten the granules and then fix then in place either on the web or in the foam or at the surface of the shell, which will he in contact with the superstructure.In summation, the superstructure can be any structure which allows liquid to enter the structure rapidly, that retains the liquid, and provides collapse resistance so that the liquid is not pressed out of the superstructure.The product of the present invention does not require a facing or cover on either portion, but if no facing or covering is used, then it is necessary to secure the superstructure within the shell so that prior to or during use the superstructure does not separate itself front the shell. If, however, it is desirable to use a covering of facing, the covering or facing placed over the open side of the shell is liquid perneable and is readily sealable to the outer rim of the shell so as to entrap the superstructure in the shell. Suitable coverings or facings for the urinary portion include fabrics, nonwoven webs, perforated films, and the like. Preferably, the facing is a thermoplastic substance which can be heat sealed to the rim of the liquid impermeable shell. The product of the present invention is worn by the wearer in the crotch region, and for simplicity is secured to the underclothing of the wearer. Securement may be effected by adhesive lines or strips on the exterior of the shell or may simply secure itself to the underclothing by means of friction. If the product is to be secured by friction, a material for manufacturing the shell is selected which will provide sufficient friction or a material is coated on the exterior of the shell to provide such friction. Examples for the preparation of the present invention are as follows. These examples are not intended to be limiting in any way and extensions and modifications thereof, without departure from the spirit and scone of the invention, will become apparent fron these examples.Example IA soft flexible shell for the urinary portion is formed by thernoforning a polyethylene ethylvinylacetate blend foan sheet. The urinary portion shell has a length of 8 inches, a width at the widest point of 4 3 3 inches, and a width at the central portion at its narrowest point of 3 3 4 inches. The shell is 7 S inches deep at the center from. a line extending across the center fron the edge of each rim of the shell.The superstructure placed in the shell consists of a twolayer fibrous web which has been corrugated. The first fibrous layer comprises 5n by weight of the final corrugated web. It consists of 75 parts of polyester fibers with 25 parts of polyester hinder fibers. bhe polyester binder fibers have a lower melting point than the renaining polyester fibers. bhe average denier of the fibers is about 15. The web is formed by a conventional carding process providing a web having a weight of about 2 oz. per sq. yd. The second layer is carded directly onto the first layer and is formed from acrylic fibers having a denier of about 1.5 which are a blend of 40 parts of the acrylic fibers with 10 parts of the same binder fibers used in the first layer.The two layer web structure is corruqated and heat set at about 3150F, vhe corrugated two layer web is 3 4 high and has approximately 4.5 folds per inch of corrugation. A corrugated web has a weight of about 12 oz. per sq. yd. The absorbent medium provided for in this urinary portion of the present product is a blend of superabsorbent identified as 10.Se manufactured and sold by Mitsubishi Company, tokyi, Japan and mineral oil. Four parts of superabsorbent are admixed with one part of mineral oil.This blend is placed on the bottom fiber layer of the two layer web and between the folds to a depth of approximate lly 1 4 to 1 2 . The amount of the blend added is approximately 1 gram of the superabsorbent mineral oil blend per gram per superstructure.A nonwoven fabric made from biconponent fibers of polyester core and polyethylene sheath having a weight of about 0.5 oz. per sq. yd. is heat sealed to the rim of the shell of the urinary cushion of the product to provide a facing or covering for the front portion.The superstructure provided for the fecal waste con ainnent rear portion of the product is made by blending 40 by weight of polyester fibers with 40 by weight of acrylic fibers and 20 by weight of binder fibers and a web is formed by carding. The web has a basis weight of about 2 oz. per sq. yd. This web is corrugated to a height of about 1.5 having about six corrugations per inch. The corrugated web has a basis weight of 30 oz. per sq. yd. The acrylic fibers placed in the web provide the necessary absorbent medium in intimate contact with the superstructure of the fecal waste containment portion.The web is stabilized by application of a latex type adhesive identified as Rhoplex No1715 manufactured and sold by Rohm and Haas Corp., in an amount of about 2 gn per sq. yd. so as to stabilize the corruqated web against collapse or separation when wet. The web is stabilized on both sides and subsequently is slit horizontally to provide two sections of web each of which is approximately the same thickness, i.e., a thickness of about 3 4 . Additional adhesive is applied on the adhesive stabilized side of the corruqated web and the web is placed in and secured in the rear portion by the adhesive sticking to the shell. The urinary portion of the product is tested by adding 20cc per second assimulated urine liquid. After the addition of the liquid, the product is left in its receiving position, i.e., substantially horizontally for 5 seconds and then is turned so that the corrugations, if the superstructure is a corrugated product, are vertical. with a discharge of lflt cc the retention of the product exhibited is 98 . A discharge of 150cc exhibited a retention of 85 and a discharge of 200cc provides a retention of about 828. The fecal portion of the product proves satisfactory in that deposit of fecal waste matter exhibits immediate acceptance and retention of any liquid portion and retains the fecal matter substantially in the place of discharge without migration to another portion of the product or outside the product. It becomes readily apparent from the above example that the present invention provides a highly satisfactory product for use by incontinent adults who are active people. It is truly surprising that a structure can be provided which will hold at least 80 of a 20Occ discharge of urine after nerely 5 seconds contact time and sinul taneously retain normal discharge of fecal matter without soiling of surrounding clothing.From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concept of this invention.
