## Description
Process for the preparation of vaccines specific forLH and HCG and process for their detectionThis invention concerns a process of preparation of vaccines for the obtention of antibodies specific for luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin and a process for their detection.The search for safe anticonceptional vaccines is usually directed on mechanical devices used at the time of an intercourse or else rests on synthetic hormones destined to a daily use the pill . A long time sterilisation obtained by the creation of antibodies that would prevent the implantation of the egg is the subject of intense research endeavours but has met with little success. Also diagnostic tests detecting LH or HCG demand antibodies that are perfectly specific for these two hormones. It has been recognised that the fecundation of the ovule induces the secretion of a hormone, chorionic gonadotropin, whose presence is needed for the nidation of the egg and its perduration during the four first months of pregnancy. This glyco proteinic hormone is constituted of 2 distinct subunits, named the alpha subunit and the beta subunit.The alpha subunit is identical to the alpha subunit of the luteinizing hormone. The ss subunit is practically identical to the A subunit of the luteinizing hormone. Some differences in composition of amino acids, all along the chain, have been discovered, as well as a lengthening in the chain of 35 amino acids at the COOH level, which do not exist with LH. A description of the amino acid chain of the subunit of HCG was given in 1973 by Bahl, different from that given byMorgan, also in 1973, in that the Leu in position 35 is replaced by Val. In any case, the amino acid of position 55 in LH is Pro, different from one or the other of the two A.A. proposed for HCG see Immunological Fertility Regulation, 1962, BlackwellPubl., p. 39 .The existence of a sequence of 35 amino acids, hereinafter in abbreviation A.A. peculiar to HCG fostered the hope that this particular sequence would immunise a human being without creating any interference specific for LH. French patent of 11.12.81 deposited under NO 81.21.164 publication NO 25.16.078 , describing the synthesis of part of this peptide, goes in this direction.A publication anterior to this patent, already demonstrated that the antibodies created against this peptide did not inhibit the biologic activity of theHCG hormone. Another research endeavour, culminating by the patent of Bahl, was taken in France under NO 78.28528, with U.S. anteriority, the U.S. patent being asked on February 6th 1978 under NO 875,497. Bahl observed that 12 cysteines dotted the polypeptidic chain of the sub unit ss of HCG. In the abovementioned patent, a graduated or total destruction of the S S bridges, entailing a concommitant destruction of the tertiary structure of the protein, was supposed to produce an antigen whose antibodies would react almost exclusively with HCG, and not anymore with LH.It is now however recognised that the created antibodies, without reacting anymore with LH, also do not anymore react with HCG.This investigation strengthened the thesis that the antibodies created against HCG should, in order to be active against the biological properties of the hormone, react against some elements of the tertiary structure tridimentional of the protein.A main object of the invention is to solve this technical problem in a very simple way.According to the invention, antibodies specific forHCG and for LH are obtained by inoculation of oligopeptides specific for those hormones. The following oligopeptides, namely 9 HCG ss Arg Cyst Arg LH ss Trp Cyst Glx 57HCG Leu Val Ual Cyst Asn LH ss Pro Val Cyst Thr 90HCG Gln Cyst Ala Leu LH Arg Cyst Gly Pro 110HCG Cyst Asp Asp Pro Arg Phe Gln LH ss Cyst Glx Asx Ser Lys Gly OH located near a cysteine and specific for the hormoneLH and HCG are linked by disulfur bridges, either among themselves or upon a A subunit chain specific for LH and for HCG, or else upon oligopeptides containing a cysteine, that are common to the 2 hormones. Amino acids that are identical to the two oligopeptide chains, such as Cyst in 9, 57, 90 and 110,Val in 56 and Asp in 112 may be replaced by A.A. analogs or antimetabolites. The obtained complexes are used alone or coupled to proteins, polyssacharides, latex, bentonite, bacteria, red blood cells or other carriers and the coupled oligopeptides are then used as vaccines anti HCG or anti LH. The oligopeptide sensitised solid carriers are used in diagnostic tests for the detection of LH and of HCG.The subunit of HCG is constituted of a polypeptide whose amino acids bricks are known. To this must be added the sugar residues, whose points of attachment to the polypeptidic chain are known. Twelve cysteines are present along the chain, which form S S bridges among themselves. Together with the sugars and the hydrogen bonds, they determine the tertiary structure of the molecule. This tertiary structure is essential for the creation of specific antibodies. Indeed, the antibodies created by a HCG chain whose disulfur bridges have been completely broken do not react anymore with HCG and also not anymore with LH.On the other hand, a well conducted immunisation with HCG, practised over several months, brings about the creation of agglutinating antibodies that react initially with LH and HCG and which become more specific for HCG in the course of time. However, the immunisation practised with the 35 amino acids composing the COOH terminal of P HCG, which are particular to this hormone, brings in no case such a creation of specific agglutinating antibodies.Unexpectedly, it appeared that the creation of specific agglutinating antibodies, on one side forHCG, on the other for LH, could be obtained in a simple way by inoculating to the animal a synthetic peptide constituted of A Acids specific for LH or HCG, localised near the disulfur bridges. So, following an advantageous mode of realisation of the invention, this discovery consists in a process of preparation of anti HCG or enit LH vaccines, consisting in the use of oligopeptides specific for the sub unit A of LH orHCG, adjacent to cysteine groups, such as 1 HCG Pro Arg Cyst Arg Pro Pro 8 Pro Trp Cyst Glx Pro 2 HCG Leu Ual Val Cyst Asn Tyr LH ss Pro Val Cyst Thr Tyr 3 HCG ss Ser Cyst Gln Cyst Ala Leu Cyst Arg LH p Ser Cyst Arg Cyst Gly Pro Cyst Arg 4 HCG Thr Cyst Asp Asp Pro Arg Phe Gln Asp LH ss Thr Cyst Glx Asx Ser Lys Gly OH characterised in that these specific polypeptides are complexed upon themselves or between themselves by disulfur bridges, or else upon their own HCG or ss LH subunit or even upon oligopeptides, containing cysteine, whose amino acids are common for LH and HCG, among which one may single out,HCG LH Gly Cyst Prol Val Cyst IleHCG LH Ile Cyst Ala Gly Tyr Cyst ProHCG LH Pro Gly Cyst Pro Arg HCG LH EMI5.1 Cyst Gly Gly through disulfur bridges.These oligopeptides may of course be used separately or together. Preferentially, the oligopeptides bound together through disulfur bridges are used as vaccines.Another advantageous characteristic of the invention entails the sensitisation of red blood cells, bacteria, latex or other solid phase with these peptides, and their use in diagnostic tests used for the detection of LH or HCG. An examination of the polypeptidic chain or ss HCG and A LH shows differences in the peptide sequence at the following levels, near cysteines 9 HCG ss Pro Arg Cyst Arg LH Pro Trp Cyst Glx 57HCG Leu Val Val Cyst Isn LH ss l Pro Val Cyst Thr 88 90 93 HCG ss Cyst Gln Cyst jAla Leu Cyst LH Cyst Arg Cyst Gly Pro Cyst HCG Cyst Asp Asp JPro Arg Phe Gln AspLH Cyst Glx Asx 1Ser Lys Gly OH The amino acids located near the other cysteines are identical for the subunit ss of LH and HCG, namely 23 26 Gly Cyst Pro Val Cyst Ile 34 38 Ile Cyst Ala Gly Tyr Cyst Pro 72 Gly Cyst Pro 100 Asp Cyst Gly It is known that the primary amino acid chain of HCC, obtained after reduction with mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol or any other suitable reducing agent named SH6 in Bahl patent, 1978 fails to create neutralising antibodies either against HCG or againstLH whereas the intact tertiary structure authorises in rate but still real cases the formation of such antibodies 100 specific for HCG, and that the inoculation of the tertiary structure of LH may induce the production of antibodies 100S specific for LH. The inventor thought that these antibodies were directed against A.A. groups located close to a disulfur bridge, such as those existing in the native molecule. Short polypeptide chains such as those here above described are easily obtained by synthesis see French patent 81.221.64 or may be bought. They may be complexed between themselves or else complexed upon a denatured ss HCG chain. This denaturation is obtained by urea or guanidine acting jointly with a reducing agent such as mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol, as is described in the 8ahl patent.The ss subunit of HCG is isolated by dissociation of the HCG molecule in urea or guanidine and separation upon a column, according to known procedures, further described by Bahl. The splitting of the disulfur bridges of the A subunit of HCG is also known and is described by Bahl. It consists essentially in a treatment by a reducing agent in the presence of urea.Synthetic peptides are treated in the same way but the presence of urea or guanidine may be omitted. The SH polypeptides that are specific of LH or HCG peptides 7 to 10, 53 to 58, 88 to 93, and 110 to 115 are easily complexed among themselves through controlled reoxydation or else complexed upon SH oligopeptides that are common to LH and HCG 21 to 27, 33 to 39, 71 to 73 and 99 to 101 , or else they are fixed to the reduced t subunit of HCG.The generation of disulfure bridges is accomplished very simply by dialysing Spectra Por G, Cutt off 1000 the reagents at 40C against a phosphate isotonic buffer, or else ammonium carbonate, or other mineral salt solution or else by passing the mixture upon a suitable molecular sieve column e.g. sephadex G 10 in order to eliminate the reducing agent and the uncomplexed surnumerous oligopeptides. A treatment with an alkylating agent such as iodoacetamine is thereafter possible but not proven really necessary.The fixation of the oligopeptides upon a subunit of HCG presents the advantage not to need anymore subsequent attachments to carrier proteins the P HCG molecule is an excellent immunogen per se, that may, however, be coupled further to another carrier such as lysozyme, myristoyl dextran or tetanus toxoid. Single oligopeptides complexed among themselves through oxidation will be immunologically more active if coupled to a carrier protein. Useful products are bacteria, hemocyanin, tetanus toxoid, myristoyl dextran, lysozyme, or other.The immunogen specific for the subunit of LH and of HCG is thereafter used as a vaccine according to known procedures Freund complete adjuvant, Freund incomplete adjuvant, MDP, etc ... .An examination of the amino acids composing the specific oligopeptides 8 to 10 55 to 58 89 to 92 and 110 to 120 and an investigation of the specificity of the antibodies produced, further shows that theseA.A. are not fully specific, be it only due to the presence of the cystein bridges. In addition, the antibodies produced against the oligopeptides specific for one or the other hormone also show some interference between LH and HCG, respectively.Accordingly, a further object of the present invention is to solve the new technical problem lying in the elimination or the sharp reduction of the interfering level shown by the anti bodies produced against the specific oligopeptides without lowering their specificity.Preferably, another object of the present invention is to improve simultaneously the specificity of said antibodies produced against said specific oligopeptides.This new technical problem and said objects are achieved simultaneously for the first time according to the present invention, in an unexpected and unobvious manner. Thus, the present invention further provides a further improvement to the above invention process which is further characterized in that it comprises replacing one or several of the amino acids within the oligopeptides by unrelated amino acids or else by amino acid analogues or antimetabolites.With this further improved process, there can be achieved a further unexpected reduction in the level of interference shown by antibodies obtained against the oligopeptides, while improving simultaneously their specificity. By the expression unrelated amino acids or amino acid analogues or antimetabolites , it is intended notably the use of amino acids other than the amino acids naturally present at a given position of the oligopeptide. Thus, for instance, cysteine at the 9 position of the specific oligopeptide 8 to 10 of A HCG, which is therefore the amino acid naturally present at the 9 position, is replaced according to the invention by another amino acid which is unrelated, analogue, homologue or antimetabolite to it, which is therefore unnatural with respect to the so called original oligopeptide, as is the case for instance of 2 mercaptohistidine or of homocysteine.In this respect, a given amino acid can be replaced not only by a single amino acid but also by a group of two or more amino acids, thereby increasing the amino acid chain. The inventor has further unexpectedly observed that the inclusion of unnatural amino acids within the oligopeptides that will serve as haptens and antigens in a vaccine has further the advantage to stimulate the formation of antibodies against these oligopeptides.According to a particularly advantageous embodiment, the process according to the invention is further characterized in that it comprises the replacement, independently or in combination, of cysteine by 2 mercaptohistidine or homocysteine the valine by CA amino chloro butyric acid aspartic acid by asparagine CC amino succinamic acid or by L cysteic acid.According to another feature of the invention process, which is optional, said process is further characterized in that it comprises also replacing the amino acids that are adjacent to the above said specific oligopeptides and which are common to LH and HCG, such as, for example, Pro in positions 7 and 11, Tyr in position 59 and Thr in position 109, by amino acids analogs, homologs or antimetabolites, and then included in the respective oligopeptidic haptens.It must be underlined that among the specific oligopeptides of k HCG, such as 9Arg Cyst Arg 57Val Val Cyst Asn 90 Gln Cyst Ala Leu 110Cyst asp Asp Pro Arg Phe GlnOne notices several amino acids which are common to LH and to HCG, notably Cyst at the 9, 57, 90 and 110 position, Val at the 56 position and Asp at the 112 position.Thus, according to a further invention improvement, these amino acids can advantageously be replaced by other analogues, homologues or antimetabolites aminoacids, as well as amino acids which are adjacent to these specific oligopeptides and which are common toLH and to HCG.Thus, according to a further preferred invention embodiment, the process comprises replacing, independently or in combination, Pro by azetidine 2carboxylic acid Tyr by 3 fluorotyrosine Thr byO methyl threonine Ser preferably at the 87 position by phenylserine.According to an alternative embodiment of the invention process, other analogue, homologue or antiretabolite amino acids can also be used, these being easily determined by the man of the art. ror instance, Tyr can be replaced by para aminophenyl 81anne, Ser can be replaced by cyano alanine, Arg by homo arginine.As previously mentioned, by introducing one or several analogue, homologue or antimetabolite amino acids in lieu of the amino acids naturally present in the oligopeptides, it is unexpectedly and unobviously achieved a sharp reduction of the level of interference shown by the antibodies against said specific oligopeetides. Further, simultaneously and unexpectedly an enhancement of specificity is achieved by the antibodies created against them. Also, it has again been observed, in an unexpected and unobvious manner for one skilled in the art, that the replacement s performed according to the invention, further stimulate s the formation of antibodies against oligopeptides, these constituting a noticable result.Further purposes, features and advantages of the invention will appear clearly from the reading of the following description setting forth several invention examples given merely for illustrating the invention and which cannot therefore be construed as limiting the invention scope.EXAMPLE I 80 mg of k HCG are solubilised in 10 ml of 0.5 M Tris HCl at pH 8.5, containing 2 EDTA and 8 M urea.The oligopeptides Pro Arg Cyst Arg Pro Val Val Cyst Asn Tyr Cyst Gln Cyst Ala Leu and Cyst Asp Asp Pro Arg 4mg each were added to the solution and the reagents treated by 100 nM of DTT at RT during 30 . The mixture was thereafter dialysed Spectra Por G 1000 during 24 hours at 40C against 8 M urea, 0.5 M Tris HCl, pH 8.5.The dialysis medium was thereafter changed during 48H at 40C, using 1 NH4 2 CO3 at pH 7.5. The dialysis bag was then collected, frozen and lyophilised.Five hundred micrograms of the complexes were inoculated to 2 rabbits in Freund s complete adjuvant and the vaccine reinoculated 3 weeks later in Freund s incomplete adjuvant. Two weeks later, the titer inHCG specific agglutinating antibodies amounted in one rabbit to 1 3.200 and in the other rabbit to 1 400.No interference with LH could be detected through agglutination of sheep red blood cells sensitised withHCG, for the antiserum obtained from the second rabbit.EXAMPLE IIEight milligrams of the oligopeptides Pro Trp Cyst Clx Pro and Arg Cyst Gly Prol Cyst were mixed to the oligopeptides Gly Cyst Prol Val Cyst Ile 6.8 mg and Ile Cyst Ala Gly Tyr Cyst Prol 8.33 mg . Solubilisation was done in 2 ml of a solution that was 0.5 M in Tris HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 ó EDTA, 8 M urea and 100 nM mercaptoethanol. After 30 at R.T. the reagents were dialysed Spectra PorG, Cut off 1000 against a solution 8 M in urea and 0.5 M in Tris HCl, pH 7.5 during 24 H at 40C, then during 3B H at 40C against 1 NH4 2 C03. After dialysis, the complex was lyophilised. Recovery amounted to 53 .Twenty milligrams were coupled to rabbit red blood cells by a technic consisting in activating the red blood cells during 48 H at 370C with glutaraldehyde, then sensitising the erythrocytes by the peptides during 24 H at 370C, the vaccine so obtained was inoculated into 2 rabbits in Freund complete adjuvant.After 2 booster inoculations effectuated in Freund incomplete adjuvant, blood was withdrawn. an antibody level of 1 400 for LH was found with the first rabbit, of 1 1.600 with the second. HCG interference amounted respectively to 1 and 4 ,0. The antibodies thus obtained could be used for a diagnostic test for LH.EXAMPLE IIIFour oligopeptides specific for HCG, namelyPro Arg Cyst Arg Pro 4.7 mg Leu Val Cyst Asn Tyr 4.9 mg Cys Gln Cyst Ala Leu Cyst 2.2 mg Cyst Asp Asp Pro Arg Phe Gln Asp 10.5 mg were solubilised together in a solution 0.5 M in TrisHC1, pH 7.5, 2 ó in EDTA and 200 nM in DTT. After 30 at R.T., the solution was dialysed against 1 NH4 2C03 during 72 H at 40C and lyophilised. Ten mg of the product were coupled during 24 H at 37DC and pH 8.0 to a suspension of 50S E. Coli bacteria activated by 2.5 ó glutaraldehyde. After washing, a vaccine was prepared in Freund incomplete adjuvant.Two rabbits were inoculated with 0.5 my of the vaccine followed by a booster inoculation, taking place two months after the primo vaccination.The serum of the two animals was tested 15 days later in an hemaglutination inhibition test using sheep red blood cells sensitised with HCG. The titer in agglutinating antibodies was respectively 1 200 and 1 800 , with excellent specificity for HCG.EXAMPLE IVFive milligrams of the oligopeptide Ser Cyst Gln Cyst Ala Leu Cyst, specific for HCG and 25 mg of the COOH terminal peptide of HCG, Thr Cyst Asp Asp Pro Arg Phe Gln Asp Ser Ser Ser Lys Ala Pro were mixed and treated as in the preceding examples in order to create disulfur bridges.Two mg of the product of reaction were coupled to 2 mg hemocyanine through 1 g lutaraldehyde in 2 ml of a phosphate solution 0.1 M at pH 8.0. After dialysis and lyophilisation, the coupled oligopeptides were incorporated in a water in oil emulsion Freund complete adjuvant and inoculated in two rabbits, with a booster inoculation made 2 months later.The agglutinating antibodies formed were specific forHCG as shown by their capacity to aggregate latex sensitised by oligopeptides specific for HCG.EXAMPLE VThe oligopeptides 1 Arg mercaptohistidine Arg Azetidine carboxylic acid 2 Val Amino Chloro Butyric acid Cyst Asn 3 Gln mercaptohistidine Ala Leu 4 methyl Threonine Cyst Asp Cysteic acid Pro Arg Phe Gln Asp Ser Ser.were complexed in the amounts 5 mg, 5 mg, 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively and lyophilised, as per example 3.Ten mg of the product was coupled to oxidised myristoyl Dextran according to known procedures and used as a vaccine in F.C.A. Two rabbits were inoculated using 2.5 mg of peptide per animal. A booster inoculation in F.I.A. was practised 4 months later and the level of antibodies produced analysed 15 days later. Both rabbits had antibodies specific for HCG, at a level of 1 100 serum dilution in an agglutination test. No detectable interference reaction against LH could be put in evidence. Of course, the invention cannot be restricted to the above embodiments given by way of example. In particular, the invention includes in its scope all the means constituting technical equivalents to the abovesaid described means as well as any combinations thereof. Notably, the replacement of the natural amino acids by other amino acids analogue, homologue or antimetabolite can be combined at will, i.e. even fully.
