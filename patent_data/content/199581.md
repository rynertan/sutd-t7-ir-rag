# Overfill and spillage protection device.

## Abstract
An environmentally safe protection device is provided to contain and store both fill hose spillage and underground tank overfill of gasoline and diesel fuel. The containment and protection device has a fill tube and an auxiliary vapor return tube to accommodate Stage I Vapor Recovery. The contain ment device also has a reservoir to contain overfill from the underground tank and spillage from the fill hose. A special valve assembly automatically drains motor fuel from the reservoir into the underground tank when the tank is at least partially empty and prevents upward passage of motor fuel and vapors into the reservoir when the tank is overfilled. A dual lid arrangement is provided to prevent water and debris from contaminating the fuel in the reservoir.
