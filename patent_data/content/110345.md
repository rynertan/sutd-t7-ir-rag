# Variable magnification electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
A variable magnification electrostatic copying apparatus comprising a stationary transparent plate for placing thereon a document to be copied, an optical system including a first re flecting mirror assembly adapted to be moved reciprocally along the transparent plate, a second reflecting mirror assem bly adapted to be moved reciprocally at a speed one half of the moving speed of the first reflecting mirror assembly and a lens assembly to be held at any one of a plurality of positions corre sponding to a plurality of projecting ratios, and a projecting ra tio changing means for moving the lens assembly and the sec ond reflecting mirror assembly so as to change the projecting ratio of the optical system. The projecting ratio changing means includes a drive source, a control means for controlling the operation of the drive source, a setting member for moving the second reflecting mirror assembly, a first power trans mission system interposed between the drive source and the setting member and a second power transmission system in terposed between the drive source and the lens assembly. The second reflecting mirror assembly is moved through the first power transmission system and the setting member, and the lens assembly is moved through the second power trans mission system.
