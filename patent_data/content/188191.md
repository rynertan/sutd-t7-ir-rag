# Method for edge contouring lenses.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for edge contouring and severing a lens such as a contact lens of an elastomeric material such as a silicone elastomer from a workpiece containing the lens. The method most preferably employs two beam focusing means such as laser optics systems situated opposite each other which project a ring shaped beam of, e.g., 10.6 micron wavelength radiation from a carbon dioxide laser at a workpiece centered between the two beam focusing means. Such a laser beam is preferably directed at both surfaces of a workpiece to fully edge contour and sever a contact lens from the workpiece in a fast and efficient manner.
