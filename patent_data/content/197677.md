## Description
This invention relates to a novel liquid crystal substance and a liquid crystal composition containing the same, and more particularly it relates to a chiral liquid crystal substance having an optically active group and a chiral liquid crystal composition containing the same. As to liquid crystal display elements, TN type display mode has now been most widely employed, but TN type display elements are inferior in response speed to emissive display elements such as electroluminescence, plasma display, etc. hence various improvements therein have been attempted and nevertheless it does not appear that a large extent of improvement has been left behind. Thus, various liquid crystal display devices based on a different principle, in place of TN type display elements have been attempted, and among them there is a display mode utilizing a ferroelectric liquid crystal N.A. Clerk et al, Applied Phys. lett., Certain compounds used for such applications have already been known. The present inventors, too have filed patent applications directed thereto. For example, EP A 110299 discloses a compound expressed by the formula wherein R₁₁ represents an alkyl group or an alkoxy group R EP A 115693 discloses a compound expressed by the formula wherein R₁₁, R EP A 164814 discloses a compound expressed by the formula wherein R The present inventors have further made research on a liquid crystal substance suitable for utilizing the chiral smectic phase of these ferroelectric liquid crystals, and as a result have found that certain above compounds of A , B or C but whose benzene ring is substituted by a halogen atom, particularly fluorine atom as a lateral substituent have superior characteristics to those of A , B or C . Similar such halogenated compounds are disclosed in Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals , The present invention resides in wherein R₁ represents an optically active 1 methyl heptyloxy group R₂ represents a non optically active group which is an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, an acyl group or an alkoxycarbonyl group each of 4 to 18 carbon atoms X₁ represents a halogen atom m and n each represent 0 or 1 and m n is 1, The above compounds expressed by the following formulae Ia and Ib wherein R₃ Representative examples of the respective compounds have the following values of physical properties phase transition points shown in Tables 1 7. Compounds of the formula I which have three benzene rings have higher upper limit temperatures of Sc phase, and among these compounds, those having no unfavorably high melting points are useful as a main component for constituting liquid crystal compositions. Next, the effectiveness of having a halogen atom as a lateral substituent on the benzene ring will be described. Table 3 shown below illustrates the phase transition points and the spontaneous polarization values Ps of halogen substituted compounds and halogen unsubstituted compounds parent compounds . Such a halogen introduction reduces the melting points of the parent compounds in most cases, but raises them in some cases. As to the compounds of the types shown in Table 3, when the halogen is F or Cℓ, a preferred rise in the upper limit temperature of Sc phase is observed. Whereas when the halogen is Br, the upper limit temperature of Sc phase is notably reduced to make impossible its observation. The effectiveness of these halogens cannot be naturally anticipated, but it can be said that F and Cℓ have a particularly preferred effectiveness. As to the Ps value, it has been found that those of halogen substituted compounds increase to about twice those of halogen unsubstituted compounds. Table 4 shows other comparison examples of halogen substituted compounds and halogen unsubstituted ones. As to the compounds of these types, too, the presence of halogen atom reduces the melting points of the parent compounds in most cases, and raises the upper limit temperatures of Sc . The clearing point Ch I point generally lowers, but only this fact is a fact anticipated from the so far known rule. The Ps value is also raised, but the effectiveness in this case is not so notable as that in the case of the compounds of the types shown in Table 3. The compound of the formula I may be prepared through the following passageways Namely, it may be prepared by reacting an acid halide of substituted benzoic acids or substituted biphenylcarboxylic acids as expressed by the formula II with a substituted phenol or substituted phenyl phenol as expressed by the formula III , in a basic solvent such as pyridine. Among the acid halides of carboxylic acids II as one of the raw materials, those wherein X₁ 3 halogen and R₁ alkyloxy group as defined in claim 1 may be prepared using a known carboxylic acid I wherein X₁ H as raw material, according to the following steps Namely, a p alkoxy substituted benzoic acid or a p alkoxy substituted biphenylcarboxylic acid I is reacted with a halogenating agent such as bromine, chlorine, N,N dichloro p toluenesulfonamide. for introducing a halogen atom to prepare a compound 2 . However, among compounds II , those wherein X₁ 3 F are preferred to prepare according to the following steps In case of m 1, Among compounds of II , those wherein X₁ 2 halogen and R₁ alkyloxy group as defined in claim 1 may be prepared from known compound in the same manner as above. The substituted benzoic acids and substituted biphenylcarboxylic acids expressed by the formula II include the following compounds Further, the substituted phenols or substituted phenylphenols expressed by the formula III as another of the raw materials include the following compounds In the above formulas, R represents an alkyl group of 4 to 18C R , an optically active 1 methyl heptyl group atoms X₂, a halogen atom or hydrogen atom and n, 0 or 1. In the above formulas, preparation of compounds wherein X₂ H is known. The optically active ester liquid crystal compound of the present invention will be described in more detail by way of Examples. In the succeeding Examples are described only those using S type compounds as the optically active alcohol for the raw material, but even when R type optically active alcohols are used as the raw material, products having the same phase transition points as those in the S type case are obtained. This is also theoretically natural. However, the angle of rotation, the helical twist direction and the direction of the spontaneous polarization in the R type case are reverse to those in the S type case. Further, the values of elemental analysis of this compound accorded well with the calculated values as follows A liquid crystal composition consisting of the following liquid crystal compounds of the formula I of the present invention was prepared This liquid crystal composition was sealed in a cell of 2 µm thick provided with transparent electrodes coated with polyvinyl alcohol and subjected to parallel alignment by rubbing the surface, and the resulting liquid crystal element was placed between two crossed polarizers and an electric field of 15 V was impressed to observe change in the intensity of transmitted light. Response time was sought from the change in the intensity of transmitted light at that time to give about 180 µsec at 25 C. The above liquid crystal composition had an upper limit temperature of S
