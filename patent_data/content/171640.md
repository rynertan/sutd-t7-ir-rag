# CATALYST COMPOSITION FOR ULTRA HIGH TEMPERATURE OPERATION

## Abstract
A high temperature stable catalyst is made with fine particles of a base metal such as chromium, hafnium and niobium or their oxides dispersed throughout a matrix made of composite particles having at least one platinum group metal on a ceria promoted, high temperature chemically stabilised refractory oxide powder. The refractory oxide powder can be either alumina, alumina powder which has been calcined at a temperature near incipient alpha alumina formation, silica alumina or zirconia. The base metal or base metal oxide comprises about 15 to 90 by weight of the total weight and the platinum group metal comprises 0.05 to 10 by weight of the total weight. The catalyst composi tion can be applied as a washcoat to conventional substrates or it can be formed into shaped catalysts. The washcoat is made by mixing together one slip containing the composite particles with a second slip containing the base metal or base metal oxide particles.
