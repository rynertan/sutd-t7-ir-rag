# Method and apparatus for message compression in a facsimile communication system.

## Abstract
A coding process for a facsimile transmission system employs block coding and dither matrices of black and white picture elements, wherein each matrix represents a portion of a subject 22 . The subject is scanned to provide gray scale tone level data, and the data of continuous tone regions of the subject is represented by standardized patterns in matrix form. A run of identical patterns is counted in the scanning direction and a symbol incidating the number of such repetitions is placed in the code in lieu of the succession of code words representing individual ones of the repeating patterns. A second symbol is inserted into the code to indicate a succession of runs of repeating patterns in the same column now positioned in two or more rows. The second symbol is utilized in lieu of a repetition of code words corresponding to each of the repeated patterns. The two symbols provide for two dimensional compression of the length of the message for improved efficiency of transmis sion of pictorial data between the subject and a display of an image of the subject.
