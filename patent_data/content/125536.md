# THERMO MAGNETIC RECORDING MATERIALS SUPPORTING SMALL STABLE DOMAINS

## Abstract
Amorphous alloys of two materials having anti ferromagnetically coupled magnetization sublattices, and capable of deposition as a thin film supporting small stable domains for thermo magnetic recording. The thin film mat erial is an alloy of at least one rare earth element and a transition metal element. A stable domain of a few microns diameter, allowing highest density of information recording, is achieved by providing the lowest possible wall energy to the domain, with a resulting low anisotropy.
