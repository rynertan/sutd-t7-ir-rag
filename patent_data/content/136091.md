# Pressurized, ice storing chilled water system.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a sealed, pressurized thermal storage system which uses ice as the static thermal storage medium. The system is applicable to diverse cooling and storage requirements such as air conditioning and other relatively large scale cooling loads. The system has one or more ice storage chilled water heat exchangers 21 in a closed pressurized water circulation system 26 with the loads for circulating chilled water thereto. A refrigeration piping system 26 circulates refrigerant through the water heat exchanger s 21 for cooling the sealed water system and for making and storing ice along the refrigerant piping within the water heat exchanger. An overflow return circuit 27 compensates for pressure variations within the sealed water system 26 , e.g. to accommodate volume changes in the stored ice.
