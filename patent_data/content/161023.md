# Charge coupled semiconductor device with dynamic control.

## Abstract
In a CCD, especially in an image sensor device, the information density can be doubled in that the electrodes 21, 22, 31, 32... are switched separately between a clock signal and a reference signal. Clock signals and reference signals are obtained as output signals of a shift register 13 controlled by a multi phase clock, which is realized, for example, in C MOS technology. Information at the input terminal 107 of the first stage 101 of the shift register 13 determines, after having been passed on or not having been passed on depending upon the clock pulse signals of the register clock, the output signal of the next stages 101 of the shift register 13 and hence the voltage variation at the electrodes 21, 22, 31, 32... connected to the outputs 113 of the stages 101 .
