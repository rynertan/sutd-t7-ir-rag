## Description
Title PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to a process for the production of indoles and, more particularly to a process for the production of indoles which are described and claimed in UR Published Patent Application No. 2124210A. The indoles described and claimed in UK Published PatentApplication No. 2124210A exhibit selective vasoconstrictor activity and are indicated for use in the treatment of migraine.Various processes for their preparation are also described inUX Published Patent Application No. 2124210A. The present invention relates to a further process for the preparation of these indoles. Thus, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of indoles of the general formula I EMI1.1 whereinR1 represents a hydrogen atom or a C16 alkyl or C36 alkenyl group R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a C13 alkyl, C36 alkenyl, aryl, ar C1 4 alkyl or C57 cycloalkyl group R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a C13 alkyl group R4 and R5, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom or a C13 alkyl or propenyl group or R4 and R5 together form an aralkylidene group and Alk represents an alkylene chain containing two or three carbon atoms which may be unsubstituted or substituted by not more than two C13 alkyl groups, and physiologically acceptable salts and solvates e.g.hydrates thereof which comprises reacting an indole of general formula II EMI2.1 wherein X represents a leaving group and R3, R4,R5 and Alk are as defined for the general formula I or a protected derivative thereof with a compound of general formula III EMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined for general formula I . Examples of the leaving group X in the compounds of general formula II include a halogen atom e.g. a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a group OR6, where R6 represents a hydrocarbyl group such as an aryl group, e.g. phenyl. The aryl moiety may be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents such as halogen atoms or nitro cyano amino alkyl e.g. methyl alkoxy e.g. methoxy acyl, e.g. acetyl and alkoxycarbonyl e.g. ethoxycarbonyl groups. Preferably, X represents a group OR6, most preferably an aryloxy group especially phenoxy. The reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of a solvent and may be effected in an aqueous or non aqueous reaction medium. The reaction medium may thus comprise one or more organic solvents, such as ethers, e.g. cyclic ethers such as dioxan or tetrahydrofuran, and acyclic ethers such as diethylether amides e.g. N,N dimethylformamide or N methylpyrrolidone alcohols e.g. methanol or ethanol esters e.g. ethyl acetate nitriles e.g. acetonitrile halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. dichloromethane and tertiary amines e.g. triethylamine, or pyridine optionally in the presence of water. In some cases the amine of formula III may itself serve as the solvent. If desired the aminolysis may be effected in the presence of a base, such as an alkali metal bicarbonate or bicarbonate e.g. sodium or potassium carbonate or bicarbonate a tertiary amine e.g. triethylamine or pyridine an alkoxide e.g. sodium t butoxide orahydride e.g. sodium hydride . The reaction may conveniently be effected at a temperature of from 20 to 1500C. The following reactions, in any appropriate sequence, may if necessary and or desired be carried out subsequent to the above described process i conversion of one compound of general formula I or a salt or protected derivative thereof into another compound of general formula I ii removal of any protecting groups and iii conversion of a compound of general formula I or a salt thereof into a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate e.g. hydrate thereof. Thus, a compound of general formula I may be converted into another compound of general formula I using conventional procedures. For example, a compound of general formula I wherein one or more of R1, R2, R4 and R5 are alkyl groups may be prepared from the corresponding compounds of formula I wherein one or more of R1, R2, R4 and R5 represent hydrogen atoms, by reaction with a suitable alkylating agent such as a compound of formula RXY where Rx represents the desired R1, R2, R4 and R5 group and Y represents a leaving group such as a halogen atom or a tosylate group or a sulphate Rx 2504. Thus the alkylating agent may be for example an alkyl halide e.g. methyl or ethyl iodide , alkyl tosylate e.g. methyl tosylate or dialkylsulphate e.g.dimethylsulphate . The alkylation reaction may be conveniently carried out in an inert organic solvent such as an amide e.g. dimethylformamide , an ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran or an aromatic hydrocarbon e.g. toluene preferably in the presence of a base.Suitable bases include, for example, alkali metal hydrides, such as sodium hydride alkali metal amides, such as sodium amide alkali metal carbonates, such as sodium carbonate and alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium or potassium methoxide, ethoxide or t butoxide. Compounds of formula I wherein R1 represents an alkenyl group, R2 represents an alkenyl, aralkyl, or cycloalkyl group and or one or both of R4 and R5 represents propenyl, may be prepared similarly, using an appropriate compound of formula RxY or RX 2S04. The starting materials of general formula II wherein X represents a group OR6 may be prepared, for example by reduction of a compound of general formula IV EMI6.1 wherein X and R3 are as previously defined above and W is a group capable of being reduced to give the required AlkNR4R5 group orto give a protected derivative of AlkNR4R5 , or a salt or protected derivative thereof. Examples of the group W include the group TN02 where T is Alk or an alkenyl group corresponding to the group Alk CHR7 xCHR8CN AlkNR4COR5 and COCONR4R5 where R7 and R8 which may be the same or different each represents a hydrogen atom or a C13 alkyl group, x x is zero or 1, and R5 is part of the group R5 or the group ORC where Rc is an alkyl or aralkyl group . Suitable reducing agents include hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst e.g. rhodium on alumina or palladium on charcoal alkali metal or alkaline earth metal borohydrides or cyanoborohydrides e.g.sodium or calcium borohydride and metal hydrides such as lithium aluminium hydride. Examples of the group W and methods for its reduction are described in more detail in UK Published Patent Application No. 2124210A. A compound of formula II wherein X represents a halogen atom may be prepared, for example by reacting the corresponding sulphonic acid derivative or a salt thereof with a halogenating agent such as a phosphorus halide or oxyhalide in an inert organic solvent e.g.phosphorus pentachloride in dichloromethane. A sulphonic acid of formula II may be prepared for example by acid or base catalysed hydrolysis of an ester of formula II , i.e. a compound wherein X represents the group OR6. A compound of general formula II where X preferably does not represent a halogen atom, may also be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of general formula V EMI7.1 where Q is the group NR4R5 or a protected derivative thereof or a leaving group such as a halogen atom e.g. chlorine or bromine or an acyloxy group such as a carboxylic or sulphonic acyloxy group e.g. an acetoxy, dichloroacetoxy, p toluenesulphonyloxy or methanesulphonyloxy qroup . The reaction may be effected in an aqueous organic reaction medium, such as an aqueous alcohol or aqueous ether. Where Q is the group NR4R5 or a protected derivative thereof the reaction is desirably effected irr the presence of an acid catalyst. This general method is described in more detail in UK Published Patent ApplicationNo. 2124210A. Compounds of general formulae IV and V may be prepared by analogous methods to those described inUK Published Patent Application No. 2035310 and AChemistry of Heterocycl ic Compounds Indoles Part II Chapter VI edited by W J Hamilton 1972 WileyInterscience, New York, as well as UK PublishedPatent Application No. 2124210A. Compounds of general formulae II , IV and V as previously defined and also sulphonic acid of formula II wherein X is a hydrogen atom and salts thereof, are novel compounds and constitute a further aspect of the present invention. Compounds of general formula II exhibit potent andw selective vasoconstrictor activity as described for compounds of UK Published Patent Application No.2124210A. Thus compounds of general formula II selectively constrict the carotid arterial bed of the anaesthetised dog, whilst having a negligible effect on blood pressure. The selective vasoconstrictor action of compounds II has been demonstrated in vitro. It should be appreciated that in some of the above transformations it may be necessary or desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the molecule of the compound in question to avoid undesirable side reactions. For example, during any of the reaction sequences described above, it may be necessary to protect the group NR4R5 wherein R4 and or R5 represents hydrogen, by protonation or with a group easily removable at the end of the reaction sequence. Such groups may include, for example, aralkyl groups, such as benzyl, diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl or acyl groups such as N benzyloxycarbonyl or t butoxycarbonyl or phthaloyl. In some cases, it may also be desirable to protect the indole nitrogen with, for example, an aralkyl group such as benzyl. Subsequent cleavage of the protecting group may be achieved by conventional procedures. Thus an aralkyl group such as benzyl, may be cleaved by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a catalyst eg. palladium on charcoal or sodium and liquid ammonia an acyl group such asN benzyloxycarbonyl may be removed by hydrolysis with, for example, hydrogen bromide ih acetic acid or by reduction, for example by catalytic hydrogenation. The phthaloyl group may be removedbyhydrazinolysis e.g.by treatment with hydrazine hydrate or by treatment with a primary amine e.g. methylamine . Where it is desired to isolate a compound of formula I as a physiologically acceptable salt, for example as an acid addition salt, this may be achieved by treating the free base of general formula I , with an appropriate acid e.g. succinic or hydrochloric acid preferably with an equivalent amount in a suitable solvent e.g. aqueous ethanol . Referring to the general formula I , the alkyl groups in the general formula I may be straight chain or branched chain alkyl groups containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or in the case of R1, 1 to 6, preferably 1 to 3, carbon atoms. Examples of an alkyl group include methyl, ethyl, propyl and isopropyl groups.The alkenyl groups preferably contain 3 or 4 carbon atoms, examples of which include propenyl and butenyl groups. The cycloalkyl groups preferably contain 5 or 6 carbon atoms and examples include cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl groups. The ter m aryl, used as such or in the term aralkyl, preferably means phenyl. The alkyl moieties of the aralkyl groups preferably contain 1 or 2 carbon atoms. Examples of an aralkyl group include benzyl and phenethyl groups. The aralkylidene group is preferably an arylmethylidene group such as benzylidene. Suitable physiologically acceptable salts of the indoles of general formula I include acid addition salts formed with organic or inorganic acid for example hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulphates, fumarates, maleates and succinates.Other salts may be useful in the preparation of the compounds of general formula I e.g. creatinine sulphate adducts. A preferred class of compounds represented by the general formula I is that in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a C16 alkyl group and R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a C13 alkyl or ar C14 alkyl group. Another preferred class of compounds represented by the general formula I is that in which R3, represents a hydrogen atom. A further preferred class of compounds is that wherein, in the general formula I , R4 and R5, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom or a C13 alkyl group, for example, a methyl group. A preferred class of compounds falling within the scope of general formula I is that wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a C13 alkyl group e.g.a methyl group R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a C13 alkyl group, e.g. a methyl, ethyl or isopropyl group, or an ar Cl 2 alkyl group e.g. a benzyl group R3 represents a hydrogen atom and R4 and R5, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom or a C 1 3 alkyl group e.g. a methyl group and physiologically acceptable salts and solvates e.g.hydrates thereof.
