# Dehydration of alcohols, preferably ethanol, using a cyclohexane entrainer.

## Abstract
The present invention is a continuous process for producing substantially anhydrous alcohols from aqueous solutions by distilling the aqueous alcohol with cyclohexane in a drying column withdrawing a ternary azeotrope overhead and recoverying substantially anhydrous alcohol containing not more than 0.1 by weight of water from the base of the drying column. The overhead distillate is fed into a decanter maintained at a temperature below the boiling point of the distillate for at least 10 minutes to separate an organic hydrocarbon phase from an aqueous phase, and the organic hydrocarbon phase is recycled to the top of the drying column. The aqueous phase is fed into the lower half of a recovery column and an overhead distillate product containing predominantly organic compounds from the recovery column is recycled to the drying column. The invention not only obviates the use of toxic entrainers such as benzenes but dramatically reduces phase separation time in the decanter. Alcohols which may be dried by this process include ethyl alcohol.

## Description
DEHYDRATATION OF ETHANOL USING CYCLOHEXANE ENTRAINER the present inver.tiori relates to improvements in proceste for the rmoval of water from aqueous alcohols, preferably from alcohols which from azeotropic mixtures with water using cyclohexane as entrainer. Various methods have been suggested for drying alcohols whether obtained from fermentation or synthetic processess. ine such method is azeotropi distillation using an entrainer.several entrainers have been used for this purpose including, glycols and hydrocarbon solvents. Of the hydrocarbon solvents benzene has hitherto been the most widely used. Benzene, however, suffers from several disadvaritages. Firstly, the toxicity of benzene has rendered it unacceptable especially if such alcohols are to be used as potable spirits. Secondly, the rate of phase separation of azeotropic distillates containing benzene is ver slow. This latter drawback has been overcome by using n heptane in conjunction with benzene to form a quaternar azeotrope.However, such quaternary azeotropes containing n hepane not only fail to resolve the problem of toxicity but also take overhead a smaller amount of water relative to benzene thus reducing the efficiency of the drying process. An additional problem has also been noted with the separation of the aqueous and organic phases from the distillate fed into a decanter. In some instances, in spite of using high boil up ratios boil up ratio is the amount of azeotrope product taken overhead to tkie amount of dried final product removed from the base of the drying still the apparent rapid initial separation of the phases is deceptive in that the organic layer still contains a significant amount of water.This inefficiency becomes apparent if the organic phase recovered from the initial separation is allowed to stand in a cool environment for a few days when a further aqueous layer separates. Thus, substantially complete separation has only been achieved by allowing prolonged periods for separation of the phases. One example of such an entrainer is benzene but even in this case substantially complete separation has not been achieved in spite of allowing several hours for phase separation. It has now been found that by using cyclohexane as an entrainer under specific distillation conditions, the toxicity problems may be minimised and substantially complete separation of the aqueous phase may be achieved in a relatively short time. Accordingly, the present invention is a continuous process for producing substantially anhydrous alcohols from aqueous solutions thereof comprising distilling a mixture of aqueous alcohol and cyclohexane fed to the upper half of a drying column withdrawing a ternary azeotrope as an overhead distillate and continuously recovering substantially anhydrous alcohol containing not more than 0.1 by weight of water from the base of the drying column, feeding the distillate into a decanter maintained at a temperature below the boiling point of the distillate for at least 10 minutes to separate an organic hydrocarbon phase from an aqueous phase, recycling the organic hydrocarbon phase to the top of the drying column, feeding the aqueous phase containing at least 30g by weight of the feed to the drying column into the lower half of a recovery column, recycling an overhead distillate product containing predominantly organic compounds from the recovery column to the drying column to a point intermediate between the aqueous ethanol feed point and the top of the drying column, and removing water substantially free from organics from the base of the recovery column. The alcohols which may be dried by the process of the present invention are suitably saturated aliphatic alcohols containing 2 or 3 carbon atoms and is preferably ethyl alcohol. The feed to the drying column is a heterogeneous mixture of aqueous alcohol and cyclohexane. This mixture suitably contains between 80 and 90 by weight of alcohol, between 5 and 10 by weight of water and between 5 and 10 of cyclohexane. The drying column suitably contains more than 50 plates, preferably between 55 and 70 plates. The heterogeneous mixture of aqueous alcohol and cyclohexane is suitably fed into the drying column at a point between the 35th and 45th plate from the base or kettle of the column. Substantially anhydrous ethanol containing not more than 0.1 and preferably not more than 0.05 by weight of water is continually drawn from the base of the drying column. The ternary azeotropic distillate withdrawn overhead from the drying column suitably contains over 70 by weight of cyclohexane, between 15 and 20 by weight of alcohol and between 2 and 7 by weight of water. This azeotropic distillate is then fed into a decanter which is maintained at a temperature below the boiling point of the ternary azeotrope. If the alcohol is ethanol, the decanter is suitably maintained below 600c preferably between 35 and 5O0C. . The use of cyclohexane as an entrainer enables rapid separation of the organic hydrocarbon phase from the aqueous phase in the decanter. For example, in the case of a ternary mixture containing ethanol, water and cyclohexane, the aqueous phase separation commences immediately on starting the settling period and is rapidly completed.To achieve substantially complete separation between the aqueous and organic phases, the residence time of the overhead product from the distilla tion in the decanter is at least 10 minutes preferably between 12 3nd 120 minutes. On separation of these phases in the decanter, the organic i rdrocarbon phase contains for instance between 10 and 15 by weight of the alcohol in the case of ethanol and this phase is recycled to the top of the drying column. The aqueous phase from the decanter which contains more than 308 by weight of the feed to the drying column is fed to the lower part of the recovery column. The recovery column suitably contains between 30 and 40 plates. The aqueous phase from the decanter is preferably fed to a point between the 7th and 20th plate from the base of the column or the kettle. In this column, the organic c ontent of the aqueous phase is distilled as overheads preferably using a reflux ratio which is in tise range of between 5 1 and 10 1.The overhead distillate from the recovery column suitably containing over 70 alcohol and between 15 and 30 of the cyclohexane entrainer is recycled to be mixed with the feed to the drying column. Water, substantially free from organics, is removed from the base of the recovery column which may be discharged at waste. The invention is further illustrated with reference to the following examples.Comparative Test not according to the invention Ethanol water azeotrope 13.6 kg containing O.69kg of water and cyclohexane 1 kg were continuously fed over 31 hours onto the 40th plate of a 58 plate Oldershaw column 50 mm diameter drying still column. Ethanol cyclohexane water ternary azeotrope 61.6 kg containing 4.6 of water was taken overhead, condensed and the two phases which formed were separated in a decanter at 38 C. The residence time in the decanter of the total overhead product and the separated upper phase amounted to 6 minutes and 4 minutes respectively. Organic upper phase 56.3 kg, containing 3.8 w w of water was recycled from the decanter to the top of the drying column. This shows that the separation of water phase was not substantially complete. Dry ethanol final product 9.4 kg, containing 0.05 w w water and 1 ppm cyclohexane was collected from the base of the drying column. The boil up ratio viz 61.5 over 9.4 was 6.6 1. Aqueous phase 5.3 kg from the drying column decanter was fed onto the 10th plate of a 35 plate Oldershaw column 50 mm diameter recovery still. Ethanol cyclohexane water azeotrope mixture 4.7 kg was taken overhead using a reflux ratio of 7 1 and this was recycled and mixed with the feed to the drying column. Water 0.6 kg was removed from the base of the recovery column.Example Ethanol water azeotrope 4.8 kg containing 0.3 kg water and cyclohexane 0.75 kg were fed over 13 hours onto the 40th plate of a 58 plate Oldershaw column 50 mm diameter drying still. Ethanol cyclohexane water ternary azeotrope 12.5 kg containing 4.6 w w water was taken overhead, condensed and the two phases which formed were separated in a horizontal, cylindrical decanter at 15 C. The residence time in the decanter of the total overhead product and the separated upper phase amounted to ca. 27 and 19 minutes respectively. Organic phase 8.7 kg fromthe decanter, containing 0.2 w w of water, was recycled to the top of the drying column. Dry ethanol final product 4.6 kg containing 0.07 w w water was collected from the base of the drying column. The boil up ratio viz 12.5 over 4.6 was 2.7 1. Aqueous phase 3.8 kg fromthe drying column decanter was fed onto the 10th plate of a 35 plate Oldershaw column 50 mm diameter recovery still. Ethanol cyclohexane water azeotrope mixture 3.5 kg was taken overhead with reflux ratio of 7 1 and this was recycled and mixed with the feed to the drying still. Water 0.3 kg was removed from the base of the recovery column. Thus, a virtually complete removal of water was achieved as above by use of a relatively low boil up rate of 2.7 1 of final product compared with a boil up rate of 6.6 1 which was reqiired in Example 2 a . Thus, the energy consumption required for such ethanol drying may be virtually halved.
