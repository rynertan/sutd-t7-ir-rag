# SECONDARY CHANNEL METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A secondary data channel is described for use in a four wire communication system in which there is continuous wire between each of two coupling transformers at a first station and each of two coupling transformers at a second station. In accordance with the invention, the transformer windings at each station that are connected to the transmission line wires are equipped with center taps G that are connected to a sec ondary channel data set. By these means a secondary data sig nal can be transmitted from one station to another by applying a signal to the center taps of the two coupling transformers at one station and receiving such signals from the center taps of the two coupling transformers at the other station.
