# Method of manufacturing a bipolar transistor having emitter series resistors.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a bipolar transistor with emitter ballast resistors R . According to the invention, there are formed on a collector region 1, 2 beside each other a base window 4 and a strip shaped opening 5 . The strip shaped opening 5 is covered, the base doping is pro vided and oxide layers 9 of the same thickness are formed in the base window and in the strip shaped opening. After formation of the emitter fingers 12 , base contact windows 14 are formed within the base zone 8 and resistance win dows 15 are formed within the strip shaped opeining 5 , whereupon simultaneously base contact zones 17 and mu tually separated emitter ballast resistors R are formed in these windows. Application inter alia in transmitter transistors.
