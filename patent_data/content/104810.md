# FLAT ROOF WITH COVER AND HOLD DOWN DEVICES

## Abstract
A loosely laid water proof membrane of elastomeric material 11 covering a flat roof is combined with a series of hold down devices 14 for securing the membrane to the roof deck 12 against wind generated uplift forces. Each hold down device 16 comprises a disk 17 having a domed, downwardly concave, middle portion 17a and a surround ing, generally flat, transverse peripheral portion 17b the radial width of which is equal to between about 25 and 50 of the radius of the disc as a whole. The discs, with their concavities facing the membrane, are arranged on the latter at predetermined spacings, being fixed in place by metallic fasteners 18 driven through the domed portions and the membrane deeply into the roof deck. The concavity of each disc is filled with a sealant 20 , so that as each disc is pressed down upon tightening of the associated fastener, the sealant is pressed down against the membrane as well as inwardly against the fastener and outwardly against the peripheral portion of the disc. An elastomeric flat ring gasket 19 may also be located between each disc s peripheral portion and the underlying membrane.
