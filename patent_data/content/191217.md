## Description
This invention relates to a process for producing glycerides using an enzyme. More particularly, the present invention relates in one aspect to a process for synthesizing glycerides by reacting a fatty acid or a fatty acid ester with glycerol in the presence of a monoglyceride lipase and or a diglyceride lipase to produce glycerides containing little or no triglyceride and consisting substantially of monoglyceride and diglyceride and in another aspect to a process for synthesizing glycerides by reacting a fatty acid or a fatty acid ester with glycerol in the presence of such a lipase to produce glycerides completely or substantially free from triglyceride and diglyceride and consisting substantially of monoglyceride. Monoglycerides and diglycerides are useful as emulsifiers and antimicrobial agents. Lipases are enzymes which hydrolyse fats and oils and esters of fatty acids. However, it is known that under certain conditions, lipases cause esterification which is the reverse of hydrolysis thereby glycerides or esters can be synthesized from fatty acid and glycerol or from fatty acid and alcohol J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol., 10, 13 22, 1964 Proc. IV IFS Ferment. Technol. Today, 315 320, 1972, issued by Society of Fermentation Technology Japan Bull. Tech Gattefosse Rep., 76, 34 36, 1983 J. Am.

Soc., 61, 191 195, 1984 Japanese Patent Publication No. 7754 1976, Japanese Patent Publication No. 23535 1982, Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 118094 1984, Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 118095 1984, etc . The lipases used in this prior art and the most popular lipases are triacylglycerol lipases which are also called triglyceride lipases. These lipases have a specificity not only to triglycerides but also to diglycerides and monoglycerides, although the specificities to each glyceride are different. Glycerides synthesized by esterification using the action of these triglyceride lipases are usually a mixture of triglyceride, diglyceride, and monoglyceride and, even when these glycerides consist substantially of monoglyceride and diglyceride, the content of monoglyceride in the glyceride mixture is low. A paper by Tsujisaka et al in Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 489 1977 at pages 415 422 compares the actions of four lipases including crude A lipase derived from Penicillium cyclopium ATCC 34613, in the synthesis of glycerides. From the data presented in that paper, it is evident that A lipase exhibits only a narrow spectrum of activity in that it functions only on lauric and oleic acids and then only in the presence of proteins or buffer to maintain pH. A later paper by the same authors in J. Biochem. Monoglycerides and diglycerides are in wide use as emulsifiers for foods, cosmetics, medicines, etc. It is known that, in their ability to act as an emulsifier, monoglycerides are far superior to diglycerides and the presence of triglycerides is not desirable. Particular types of monoglycerides such as monolaurin, monocaprin and the like are in use as antimicrobial agents or antiseptic agents, e.g. for foods. In general, glycerides used as emulsifiers are required to contain at least about 90 mole of monoglycerides. Hence, in the conventional production of such glycerides, it has been necessary to subject a glyceride mixture to molecular distillation or the like to enhance the content of monoglycerides. The present invention seeks to provide a process for producing glycerides consisting substantially of monoglyceride and diglyceride, useful as emulsifiers and antimicrobial agents, as well as to provide a process for producing glycerides consisting substantially of monoglyceride. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided monoglycerides and diglycerides substantially free from triglycerides which comprises reacting glycerol with a fatty acid or an ester of a fatty acid and agitating the reaction mixture in the presence of a monoglyceride lipase and or a diglyceride lipase, characterised in that the lipase is enzyme II derived from Penicillium cyclopium. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for producing monoglycerides substantially free from triglycerides and diglycerides which comprises reacting glycerol with a fatty acid or an ester of a fatty acid and agitating the reaction mixture in the presence of a monoglyceride lipase and or a diglyceride lipase, characterised in that the lipase is enzyme II derived from Penicillium cyclopium, and that the reaction is carried out for 1 to 50 hours at an initial glycerol to raw material fatty acid or ester mole ratio from 0.2 50 1 in the presence of from 2 to 5,000 units of the lipase per mole of raw material fatty acid or ester thereof. The accompanying drawing illustrates a glyceride composition prepared according to the present process, analyzed using thin layer chromatography and a hydrogen flame ionization detector. In the drawing, MG is monoglyceride 1,2 DG is 1,2 diglyceride 1,3 DG is 1,3 diglyceride and FA is fatty acid. According to the present invention, a fatty acid or fatty acid ester is reacted with glycerol in the presence of a monoglyceride lipase and or a diglyceride lipase under appropriate conditions, whereby glycerides are synthesized completely or substantially free from triglyceride or substantially free from triglyceride and diglyceride. The lipase used in the present invention is an enzyme which can hydrolyse a monoglyceride wherein one of the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol is esterified with a fatty acid and or a diglyceride wherein the two hydroxyl groups at the 1,2 or 1,3 or 2,3 positions of glycerol are esterified with a fatty acid, but has little or no effect on triglycerides wherein all three hydroxyl groups of glycerol are esterified by fatty acid. The lipase used in the invention is enzyme II derived from Penicillium cyclopium an preferably derived from the Penicillium cyclopium deposited with the American Type Culture Collection under the Accession Number ATCC 34613. This strain is listed in the ATCC catalogue and is readily available. It is know that, besides producing a triglyceride lipase, Penicillium cyclopium produces a lipase having a specificity for monoglycerides and diglycerides J. Biochem., 87, 205 211, 1980 . However, the present inventors do not know any literature suggesting that said lipase is usable for the purpose of the present invention. To prepare a lipase for use in the present invention, a strain of Penicillium cyclopium capable of producing a lipase having a specificity for monoglycerides and or diglycerides is grown in a medium used in ordinary cultivation of microorganisms and the lipase accumulated in the cultivation mixture is collected. Purification of the lipase collected from the cultivation mixture can be conducted using known purification means however, for the purpose of the present invention, there is no need to purify the lipase. Only in the case where the crude lipase contains a triglyceride lipase must the triglyceride lipase be removed. Although a cultivation mixture obtained with the preferred Penicillium cyclopium ATCC 34613 contains a triglyceride lipase, this lipase can be separated and removed by subjecting a crude enzyme solution prepared form the cultivation mixture to chromatography, particularly preferably chromatography using DEAE Sepharose CL 6B. In the present invention, the preferred fatty acids are those having from 4 to 22 carbon atoms they may be saturated or unsaturated and may have straight or branched chains. The preferred esters are the methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, benzyl, amyl and vinyl esters of such fatty acids. Also useful are hydrolyzates of fats and oils obtained by physicochemical means such as an autoclave process, the Twitchell method, saponification and the like or by enzymatic means using a triglyceride lipase. Especially preferred fatty acids are, for example, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid, lauric acid, capric acid, caprylic acid, caproic acid and isostearic acid, and especially preferred esters are, for example, vinyl stearate, vinyl palmitate, vinyl laurate and vinyl caprate. According to the present invention, the proportions of product monoglycerides and diglycerides can be varied widely by selecting reaction conditions appropriately. Thus, the ratio of monoglycerides in the product glycerides can vary from about 50 molar ratio to substantially 100 . In order to synthesize a mixture of monoglycerides and diglycerides, it is preferred that the reaction time is 1 hour to 5 days, the amount of lipase is 2 to 10,000 units per mole of raw material fatty acid or ester thereof and the mole ratio of glycerol to raw material fatty acid or ester thereof is 0.2 200 1. In order to synthesize substantially only monoglycerides, it is necessary that the reaction time is 1 to 50 hours, the amount of lipase is 2 to 5, 000 units per mole of raw material fatty acid or ester thereof and the initial glycerol to raw material fatty acid or ester mole ratios 0. 2 50 1. In both cases, i.e. for producing a mixture of monoglycerides and diglycerides and for producing substantially only monoglycerides, it is preferred that the reaction temperature is from 20 to 55 C that the water content in the reaction mixture is 30 by weight or less and that the pH is maintained within the effective range for the lipase. The resulting glyceride product can be separated from the reaction mixture by extraction with an organic solvent such as petroleum ether or the like, followed by vacuum distillation or alkaline refining to remove fatty acids. Unreacted raw material can be used again as a raw material for glyceride synthesis. When the glycerides obtained contain a sufficiently high proportion of monoglyceride, the mixture In the accompanying drawing, there is shown a typical example of composition analysis for glycerides synthesized from oleic acid and glycerol according to the invention. After completion of the reaction between oleic acid and glycerol, the reaction mixture was subjected to extraction with petroleum ether and then the components in the resulting extract were analyzed employing thin layer chromatography on silica gel using a hydrogen flame ionization detector lactroscan TH 10 manufactured by Iatron Laboratories, Inc. . As is clear from the drawing, the components in the glyceride obtained are mostly a monoglyceride MG, namely, monoolein a 1,2 diglyceride 1,2 DG, namely, 1,2 diolein and a 1,3 diglyceride 1,3 DG, namely, 1,3 diolein are present in small amounts and no triglyceride namely, triolein was synthesized. In the drawing, FA implies unreacted oleic acid. The present invention will be explained in detail below by referring to Experiments and Examples. Analysis of glycerides synthesised as well as measurement of the proportion of a fatty acid or an ester thereof consumed in glyceride synthesis hereinunder this proportion is referred to as consumption rate were made as follows. Also, the definition of unit of lipase is given below. The reaction mixture was extracted with petroleum ether. The components in the resulting extract were subjected to a preparative silica gel thin layer plate PLK 5 manufactured by Whatman Co. . Development was conducted with petroleum ether diethyl ether acetic acid 80 30 1 by volume and spots were detected with iodine vapor. Each spot containing one glyceride was recovered and subjected to quantitative determination of each particular glyceride using a reagent composition Triglyceride G test Wako, manufactured by Wako Pure Chem. Ind., Ltd. for enzymatic triglyceride determination using a triglyceride lipase, glycerol kinase, glycerol 3 phosphate oxidase and peroxidase. The proportion of each molecule species was expressed as mole . The reaction mixture was extracted with petroleum ether and the components in the resulting extract were analyzed with the above mentioned thin layer chromatography using hydrogen flame ionization detector. The consumption rate of raw material fatty acid or ester thereof was expressed as percentile proportion of the sum of the peak area of glycerides obtained to the total peak area of glycerides obtained and unreacted fatty acid or ester thereof. 0.95 ml of 50 mM acetate buffer solution pH 5.6 containing 2.5 mM p nitrophenyllaurate and 2.0 Triton X 100 was mixed with 0.05 ml of an enzyme solution. Incubation was conducted for 15 min at 37 C and then 2.0 ml of acetone was added to quench the reaction. Thereafter, the amount of p nitrophenol liberated in the reaction was determined from an absorbance at 410 nm. The amount of lipase required for liberating 1 µ mole p nitrophenol per min in the above reaction was defined as 1 unit.

From the resulting cultivation mixture mycelia was removed by filtration. The resulting filtrate was subjected to ultrafiltration for concentration. The resulting concentrate was subjected to chromatography using DEAE Sepharose CL 6B manufactured by Pharmacia Co. to separate and remove a triglyceride lipase present and to obtain a purified lipase preparation. It was ascertained that this lipase preparation hydrolyzes monoglycerides and diglycerides but has little hydrolyzing activity on triglycerides. In the following, this lipase preparation was used.
