# Method of precisely locating the end of a dielectric optical waveguide in a waveguide coupling device.

## Abstract
A technique for aligning and coupling dielectric optical waveguides comprises threading the end of waveguide 20 through the central opening of a triad ball connector and forming by fusion a generally spherical glass bead 24 on the end of the waveguide using, for example, an electric arc. The waveguide is then drawn back so that the bead 24 contacts the balls of the triad connector to accurately locate the waveguide. The bead acts as a locating element and also has beneficial focussing properties.
