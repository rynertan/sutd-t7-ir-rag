# Potassium aluminum phosphate compositions, process for the preparation thereof as well as articles and coatings made from said compositions.

## Abstract
Self setting potassium aluminum phosphate composi tions of matter are prepared by forming an aqueous slurry of a potassium source, an aluminum source and a phosphate source mixing the slurry for a period of time sufficient to form a reactive, creamy mass having a viscosity of at least 2000 cps and setting or curing the reactive creamy mass. The product is porous, can be foamed or nonfoamed, adheres well to substrates and when foamed, can be lightweight.
