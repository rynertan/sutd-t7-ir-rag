# Flux for brazing aluminium and method of employing the same.

## Abstract
In the brazing of aluminium a flux composed of a mixture of alkali metal fluoaluminates, with or without admixed AlF₃, is employed. The flux has a composition of AlF₃ about 53 62 , KF about 35 44 and LiF about 2 7 , in terms of simple compounds. The flux has a liquidus temperature in the range of 490 560 C depending on its actual composition. The flux is of particular utility when brazing aluminium containing 0.4 2 magnesium and or having a low solidus temperature and is preferably em ployed in an atmosphere of a dry, inert gas.
