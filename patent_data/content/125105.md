# Immobilization of catalytically active microorganisms in agar gel fibers.

## Abstract
A process for immobilizing enzyme containing microbial cells by contacting such cells with an aqueous agar solution containing from about 1.0 to 8.0 sulfate moiety on a weight weight basis, contacting a solution of inorganic sodium salts with a stream of the cell mixture whereby agar fibers containing cells are formed and recovering the cell containing agar fibers produced.
