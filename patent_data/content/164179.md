## Description
ADHESIVES AND APPLICATIONS TH OF This invention relates to adhesives, and especially to adhesives for use in adhering interlinings to outer fabrics. It is common practice in the manufacture of articles of clothing incorporating interlining stiffeners, for example, in collars and cuffs and the facings of jackets and the like to adhere the interlining material to the outer fabrics by means of a thermoplastic adhesive thereby avoiding the necessity for sewing.The adhesive layer may be either discontinuous, in a regular or random form, or continuous, for example, as a film or web. One of the earliest used thermoplastic adhesives was low density polyethylene which was usually applied in powder form, for example, by scatter coating. The main disadvantage with this material is that relatively low bond strengths are achieved and the resultant bond has very poor resistance to dry cleaning solvents. Polyamides have also been widely used in adhering interlinings to fabrics. They have a better dry cleaning resistance than low density polyethylene but there are limitations on washing see for example Polymer Technology by D C Miles and J H Briston pages 609 to 630, Chemical Publishing Co., New York 1979 . These traditional adhesive systems operate by mechanical adhesion, that is to say the polymer flows and attaches itself around the fibres of the interlining and the outer fabric. This invention provides an adhesive that forms a chemical bond with many of the textile materials used as interlinings and as outer fabrics and also with various other substrates and therefore produces an extremely strong bond with good resistance to dry cleaning and washing. According to the invention the new polymer system as an adhesive for adhesive for adhering textile materials to textiles and other substrates comprises an engrafted terpolymer comprising units of ethylene, a C1 to C4 alkyl acrylate and an unsaturated acid, the terpoly er comprising from I to 40 parts by weight of alkyl acrylate, from 0.5 to 40 parts by weight of unsaturated acid and the residue,bei ethylene, the melt index D 1238 of the polymer being within the range of from 2 to 250g lOmin, preferably 5 to lOOg lOmin and even norse preferably 5 to 40g IOmin. The preferred alkyl acrylate for use in the terpolymer is ethyl acrylate because of its ease of handling and because the resultant terpolyier has overall good properties making it suitable as an adhesive. The preferred unsaturated acids used in the terpolymer are maleic and fabric acid, the former being preferred for use in the form of its anhydride. The terpolymers can be obtained in many forms and can be applied, for example, as dispersions, or as powders, films or granules for hot melt adhesives. Because of the presence of the unsaturated acid the polymer is unsaturated and it is possible to crosslink the polymer. This can be achieved using a wide variety of monomeric or polymeric cross linking agents, for example, etberified melamine and urea formaldehyde resins, urea and melamine formaldehyde resins, isocyanates, butyrals and formals, expoxides polyasines, polyamines, polyesters and vinyl alcohol polymers and copolymers.Alternatively, the crosslinking agent may comprise a blocking agent, for example, an isocyanate and a phenol. if one or both of the substrates to be joined has functional groups capable of reacting with the terpolymers, no additional cross linking agent may be needed. As such substrates there may be entiond ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer or polyvinyl butyral or formal substrates. The polymer may be obtained in a wide range of particle sizes, a satisfactory distribution ranging from I to 1000 microns. Liquid adhesive systems can best be obtained using particles below 100 microns and dispersing them in water using standard thickening agents, for example, sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose or a polyacrylate and dispersing agents. The techniques used are generally the same as in conventional paste techniques and the reactive components, of course, must be active at temperatures above those required to drive off the liquid phase of the system, for example, above 100C. If the polymer is to be applied by a powder point technique the particle size range is preferably from 1 to 250 microns and the polymer may be applied, for example, by an engraved roller technique or a rotary screen. For scatter coating the particles may be in the range from 1 to 1000 microns. The polymers may also be applied by hot melt printing using either an engraved roll or the rotary screen. This is preferably done using granules rather than powder, mainly for economic reasons but is possible to operate this technique using powder. The polymers may also be used as films, for example, in thicknesses of from 5 to 500 microns. Films may be co extruded, for example, with another polymer substrate capable of undergoing crosslinking with the adhesive polymer. As an alternative to the use of a film the polymers may be used as a mesh or net, formed, for example, by slitting or embossing the film along spaced parallel paths and then stretching the film in the direction perpendicular to the paths to cause the film to split in the weakened areas. By this means a mesh having rhombic openings can be obtained. When the polymers are applied as powders, pastes or as hot melt adhesives, there is usually no significant change in the hand of the laminated material. When the polymer is used in film form there may be some stiffening but generally this merely enhances the effect of the interlining. The polymers can be activated as adhesives at temperatures in the range of from 80 C to 180 C and can thus be used with little risk of discoloring or damaging one or more of the components of the structure being produced. In addition to being suitable for adhering textiles to textiles, which may either be the same or different, the polymers may also be used for adhering textiles to other substrates, for example, to netals, plastics, paper, foams or films, wood or glass and can also be used successfully in other fields, for example, adhesion of rubber or plastics to glass, where the reactive groups of the polymer, for example, the carboxyl groups or the double bonds can enter into a chemical reaction with one or other of, preferably both, of the materials to be bonded. The polymers of the invention can also be used as coating materials.
