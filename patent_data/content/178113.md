# Reagent for assaying creatine kinase.

## Abstract
A reagent system for assaying creatine kinase is disclosed. The reagent system consisting essentially of a first reagent comprising glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, Î² nicotin amideadenine dinucleotide phosphate , and adenosine di phosphate, and a second reagent comprising creatine phospha te, said second reagent being maintained at a pH of from 7.5 to 10, and at least one of said first reagent and said second reagent containing glucokinase and glucose. The creatine kinase assaying reagent exhibits remarkably improved stability in a dissolved state so that it can be prepared in large quantities and can be conventionally utilized to cope with urgent clinical examinations.
