# Catalytic process.

## Abstract
A catalytic process for hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds is carried out in a two phase aqueous organic medium, in which the catalytic complex is dissolved in the aqueous phase and to which is added an amphiphilic reagent to facilitate phase boundary crossing of dissolved species. Catalyst separation from reaction products is there by rendered more efficient. The catalytic complex is preferably formed in situ and contains a water soluble phosphine ligand, preferably a hydroxy or carboxy aryl phosphine.
