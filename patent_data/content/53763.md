# Composition for tread rubber of tires.

## Abstract
A composition for tread rubber of tires containing a synthetic isoprene rubber having a 3,4 bonding content of at least 15 by mole and an intrinsic viscosity of at least 2.0 in toluene at 30 C. The composition can provide a rubber having an improved frictional characteristic on wet road with an excellent rolling resistance characteristic, and is very useful as a tread rubber of tires.
