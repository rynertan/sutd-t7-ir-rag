# Machine tool having power controlled adjustable arbor set up for straddle milling.

## Abstract
A machine tool having a numerically controlled adjust able arbor for facilitating different straddle milling opera tions on random workpieces without the need for manual adjustment of the cutter width comprises a frame which carried a power station thereon. The power station has a rotary driven spindle which is journaled within a quill which is movable out from and into the power station under nu merical control. A bifurcated arbor, configured of a pair of coaxial shafts which are in sleeved engagement with each other so as to be axially movable to and from each other while rotating co jointly with each other, is coupled at one end to the power station spindle and is journaled at its distal end in a fixed arbor support. Each shaft of the bifurcated arbor carries a straddle milling cutter thereon in spaced apart relationship with the cutter on the other arbor mem ber. By controlling the axial movement of the power station quill, the separation between straddle milling cutters can be controlled accordingly without the need for operator inter vention.
