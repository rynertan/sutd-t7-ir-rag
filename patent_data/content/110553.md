# Series vibration damper with non symmetrical curve.

## Abstract
A series vibration damper assembly 10 which includes a control device that will allow the damper to react differ ently in the coast direction than in the drive direction. The vibration damper assembly includes a housing having in wardly offset drive straps, a hub 13 having radial arms 19 aligned with the drive straps 34, 39 in a static condition, a plurality of spring separators positioned between the hub arms and separating damper springs received between the hub arms. The improvement of the present invention relates to a curved bypass thrust member 25 secured to each hub arm and projecting through two damper springs and the spring separator to abut the next spring separator and pre vent compression of the two springs in the coast direction.
