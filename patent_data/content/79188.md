# Magneto optic rotator.

## Abstract
A single, continuous strand of fiber optic material 32 is wrapped about a mandrel 70 to form oval shaped loops having parallel sides 82, 84, 88, 92 and curved ends 78, 83, 86, 90. A magnet 100 is positioned so that its B field is substantially parallel to the straight portions 82, 84, 88, 92 of the loops. As light propogates through these straight portions 82, 84, 88, 92 of the loops, its direction of polarization is rotated in accordance with the Faraday effect. The curved portions 78, 83, 86, 90 are formed to create sufficient linear birefrigence to provide a phase difference ot 180 degrees between light in the two orthogonal polarization modes of the fiber 32. This causes the Faraday rotations in each of the straight portions 82, 84, 88, 92 to add, rather than cancel. The magneto optic rotator of the present invention is useful in a variety of applications such as an optical isolator, a modulator, and a magnetometer.
