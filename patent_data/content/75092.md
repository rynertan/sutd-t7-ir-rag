# Charge coupled device ripple adder.

## Abstract
A ripple adder is implemented as a charge coupled device in such a manner that each carry bit propagates between succeeding full adder stages substantially simul taneously as each stage computes the sum of its two bits, so that the addition in each full adder stage may be carried out in parallel rather than in succession. The i
