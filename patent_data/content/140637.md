# Distillation column.

## Abstract
Dual interrelated distillation columns are disclosed where in the heat for a first column is transferred by thermal conduc tion through a common wall or surface to a second column to increase efficiency and decrease waste of energy. In one em bodiment, the first heat generating column is a cylindrical col umn, and the second column is an annular column concentric to the first column. This concentric arrangement permits the heat generated in the first column to flow outwardly into the second column, thereby improving its efficiency and reducing the heat loss. Typically, the inner first column is a high pres sure rectifying column, and the outer concentric column is a stripping column. In an alternate embodiment, the inner col umn can simply be a portion of a high pressure distillation process, and the outer column is a portion of a lower pressure distillation column. In alternative embodiments, the rectifying apparatus can assume a variety of shapes such as a plurality of packed tubes which extend through the stripping column or a corrugated configuration or rectangular configuration as de sired.
