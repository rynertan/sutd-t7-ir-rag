# Focus detector.

## Abstract
Electro optical focus detection apparatus for providing a signal indicative of the magnitude and polarity of focus error in a light beam impinging on a surface, such as a recording surface in a recording or playback system. The detector includes a beam splitter 20 for dividing the beam reflected from the recording surface 16 into two reflected beams 24,30 of equal power, and includes an aperture 26 placed in the path of the two reflected beams. The first reflected beam converges at a focal point 24 before encountering the aperture 26 and the second reflected beam converges at a focal point 30 after encountering the aperture, both beams thereafter impinging upon separate photodetector elements 28a,28b . The aperture 26 reduces the light incident on the photodetectors 28a,28b from both reflected beams, and the apparatus is so configured that the powers of the reflected beams incident on the photodetector elements are identical when the original beam is in focus on the recording surface. When the original beam moves out of focus with the recording surface 16 , both focal points 24,30 of the reflected beams move in the same direction, to provide an increase in the light falling on one of the photodetector elements and a decrease in light falling on the other, such that the differential output 36 derived from the photodetector elements 28a,28b provides a signal indicative of the magnitude and polarity of the focus error.
