# High pressure hydraulic systems.

## Abstract
In a high pressure hydraulic system a slave unit 3 is supplied with fluid from a source 1 through a control valve assembly 8 . The assembly 8 has valve means 25 to control flow between ports 19, 22 communicating with the source 1 and slave unit 3 . The valve means 25 has two members 26, 27 , a first member 26 controlling flow through the first port 19 in response to a spring 29 , a solenoid, and the pressure differential, the solenoid being unable to move the member 26 against a significant pressure differential, and a second member 27 controlling flow through the second port 22 in dependence on the first member 26 , the pressure differential and a spring 34 . The first port 19 has an elastomeric seal 28 preventing leakage when the port is closed. The system has particular advantages when it is used as a vehicle suspension levelling system, in which an electronic control system controls the supply of fluid from an accumulator 1 through a manifold 7 and control valve assemblies 8, 9, 10 to hydraulic suspension struts 3, 4, 5, 6 in accordance with ride height signals.
