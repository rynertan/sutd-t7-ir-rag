# Signal sampling system.

## Abstract
A signal sampling system includes a combined digital and analog acquisition time base for accurately sampling and displaying an extremely short duration electrical event superimposed on a long time duration signal. The signal sampling system comprising a digital 42 and an analog delay generator 44 is intended for use in stimulus re sponse situations, and both stimulus and response signals are synchronized with the clock 40 of the digital portion of the time base. The system may be operated under micro processor control, providing both flexibility and programm ability, in turn permitting not only acquisition of waveforms that start and stop at arbitrary points with extreme precision, but signal averaging or smoothing as well.
