## Description
MILBEMYCIN D DERIVATIVES. THEIR PREPARATION AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM The present invention relates to a series of new derivatives of the compound known as milbemycin D, to a process for their preparation and to pharmaceutical, veterinary, agricultural and horticultural compositions containing them. Milbemycin D was disclosed in U.S. Patent No.4,346.171. where it was referred to as compoundB 41D , and may be represented by the formula I EMI1.1 Milbemycin D was found to have valuable anthelmintic and acaricidal activities and was prepared by cultivation of the StreDtomvces strain B 41 146. which had been deposited at the Fermentation ResearchInstitute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology,Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan, whence it is available under the accession number FERM 1438. We have now discovered a series of derivatives of milbemycin D having good anthelmintic, acaricidal and insecticidal activities, which are, in certain test systems, significantly better than the corresponding activities of milbemycin D itself. The compounds of the present invention are the 5 milbemycin D half esters of dibasic acids and salts thereof. These half esters may be represented by the formula II EMI2.1 in which R represents a straight chain alkylene group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. a vinylene group or a group of formulaEMI3.1 in which X represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The invention further provides a process for producing the compounds of the invention by reacting milbemycin D with a dibasic acid of formula HOOC R COOH in which R is as defined above or with a functional equivalent thereof, one carboxy group in said acid or equivalent being optionally protected a if necessary removing the protecting group and, if necessary, salifying the product. The invention also provides an acaricidal, anthelmintic and insecticidal composition for pharmaceutical, veterinary, agricultural or horticultural use and comprising, as active ingredient, at least one of the compounds of the invention in admixture with a carrier or diluent. The invention also provides a method of protecting plants or non human animals from damage by acarids, helminths or insects. by applying to said animals. seeds, said plants or a locus including the same at least one compound of the present invention. In the compounds of formula II , where R represents an alkylene group, it may be a methylene. ethylene, trimethylene or tetramethylene group, more preferably an ethylene or trimethylene group. Where R represents a substituted or unsubstituted phenylene group of formula EMI4.1 and X represents an alkyl group, this may be a straight or branched chain group having from 1 to 6, more preferably from 1 to 4, carbon atoms, such as a methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or isobutyl group, more preferably a methyl group. However, X most preferably represents a hydrogen atom. Compounds of formula II are able to form salts, for example alkali metal salts, such as lithium, sodium or potassium salts alkaline earth metal salts. such as calcium or barium salts other metal salts, such as magnesium salts salts with basic amino acids, such as lysine or arginine ammonium salts and salts with organic amines, such as cyclohexylamine, diisopropylamine, triethylamine, aniline, N,N dimethyl aniline or pyridine. Of these, the sodium and potassium salts are particularly preferred since water soluble salts, such as the sodium salt, are well absorbed into the animal body. The most preferred compounds of the invention are compounds of formula II in which R represents an ethylene, trimethylene, vinylene or o phenylene group and their sodium and potassium salts. Compounds of formula II may be prepared by reaction of milbemycin D, having the aforementioned formula I , with a dibasic acid of formula HOOC R COOH in which R is as defined above or with a functional equivalent of said acid. Suitable functional equivalents include any of those commonly used for conventional esterification reactions, such as the acid halides preferably the mono acid halide , mixed anhydrides with monocarboxylic acids and internal anhydrides. Preferred acids and functional equivalents are compounds of formula III EMI5.1 i.e. the internal anhydrides, and compounds of formula IV Y CO R COOH IV in which R is as defined above Y represents a hydroxy group, a halogen atom or a C2 C5 alkylcarboxy group and the group COOH is optionally protected Where the functional equivalent is a mono acid halide, the remaining carboxyl group of the dicarboxylic acid is preferably protected with a conventional protecting group, such as an alkyl e.g. t butyl , aralkyl e.g. benzhydryl or haloalkyl e.g. 2,2,2 trichloroethyl group. Of the dicarboxylic acids and functional equivalents thereof, we prefer to use either the mono acid halide in which the remaining carboxyl group has been protected or the internal anhydride, most preferably the internal anhydride, which may be represented by the formula III . The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a base and of an inert solvent. Examples of suitable bases include organic amines, such as triethylamine, pyridine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, N,N dimethylaniline, 115 diazabicyclo 4,3,O nonene 5 or 1,8 diazabicyclo 5,410 undecene 7. There is no particular limitation on the nature of the solvent employed in this reaction, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction.Suitable solvents include hydrocarbons, such as hexane, benzene, toluene or xylene ethers, such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran and halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride or chloroform. In general, the reaction temperature may vary over a wide range, although a relatively low temperature is normally preferred. in order to minimise side reactions. Accordingly, a suitable temperature range is from 10 to 500C, more preferably about room temperature. At a reaction temperature within this range, the reaction will normally require a period of from 1 to 50 hours. Where a mono acid halide whose carboxyl group is protected is employed as the functional equivalent. the protecting group may be removed by conventional means, the precise reaction depending upon the nature of the group. For example, where the group is an alkyl or aralkyl group, this may be removed by treating the product with an acid or, where it is a haloalkyl group, it may be removed by reaction with zinc acetic acid. After completion of the reaction, the desired product may be recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional means. for example by pouring the reaction mixture into ice water and then extracting the product with a water immiscible organic solvent. After drying the organic extract and distilling off the solvent, the resulting residue can, if necessary, be further purified by such conventional techniques as recrystallisation and or column chromatography. Salts of the compounds of formula Il can readily be prepared by reacting the compound of formula II with an appropriate alkali or base. For example. in the case of the preferred sodium and potassium salts, these may be prepared by reacting the compound with a hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of sodium or potassium, preferably sodium or potassium bicarbonate. The compounds of the invention have a strong acaricidal activity against, for example, adults, imagos and eggs of Tetranychus, Panonychus and rust mites, which are parasitic to fruit trees, vegetables and flowers. They are also active against Ixodidac,Dermanysside and SarcoPtidae, which are parasitic to animals. Further, they are active against exoparasites, such as Oestrus, Lucilia, HYpoderma, GautroPhilus, lice and fleas, which are parasitic to animals and birds domestic insects, such as cockroaches and houseflies and various harmful insects in agricultural and horticultural areas, such as aphids and larvalLepidoptera. They are also effective against Meloidoqyne in the soil and Phizoglyphus.They are also effective against insects of the orders Coleoptera, Homoptera, HeteroPtera, DiPtera, Thysanoptera,OrthoPtera, Anoplura, Siphonaptera, MalloPhaqe, Thysanura, Isoptera, PsocoPtera, and Hymenoptera. The compounds of the invention equally can be used to control other plant damaging insects, particularly insects that damage plants by eating them. The compounds can be used to protect both ornamental plants and productive plants, particularly cotton e.g. against Spodoptera littoralis and Heliothis virescens . as well as vegetable crops e.g. against LePtinotarsa decemlineata and MYZUS Persicae and rice crops e.g.against Chilo suppressalis and LaodelPhax . The activity of the compounds of the invention is pronounced, both systemically and by contact.Accordingly, the compounds are very effective against sucking insects, especially sucking insects of the orderHomoPtera and most particularly the family Aphididae such as APhis fabae, APhis craccivora and Mvzus persicae , which are difficult to control with known compositions. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be used to treat all manner of plants as well as the seeds from which such plants are grown and the environment containing such plants to protect them from insects such as those exemplified above. Such plants include cereals e.g. maize or rice . vegetables e.g. potatoes or soybeans , fruits and other plants e.g. cotton . The compounds of the invention can similarly be used to protect animals from a variety of ectoparasites, by applying the compounds to the animals or to the animals environment, e.g. livestock housing, animal boxes, abattoirs, pasture land and other grasslands, as well as to any other places liable to be infested. The compounds may also be applied to external parts of the animals, preferably before they are infested. Moreover, the compounds of the invention are effective against various parasitical helminths. These parasites can attack livestock, poultry and pet animals such as pigs, sheep, goats, cows, horses, dogs, cats and fowl and can cause grave economic damage. Among the helminths, the nematodes in particular often cause serious infection. Typical genera of nematodes which are parasitic on these animals and against which the compounds of the invention are effective include Haemonchus, Trichostronpylus. Ostertagia, Nematodirus, Cooperia, Ascaris, Bunostomum, Oesophagostomum, Chabertia Trichuris Stronqylus, Trichonema, Dictyocaulus. Capillaria, Heterakis, Toxocara, Ascaridia, Oxvuris, Ancylostoma, Uncinaria, Toxascaris and Parascaris. Certain species of the genera Nematodirus, CooPeria and Oesophagostomum attack the intestines, while certain species of the genera Haemonchus and Ostertaaia parasitize the stomach, and parasites belonging to the genus Dictyocaulus are found in the lungs. Parasites belonging to the families Filariidae and Setariidae are found in internal tissues and organs, for example, the heart, the blood vessels, the subcutaneous tissues and the lymphatic vessels. The compounds of the invention are active against all these parasites. The compounds of the invention are also effective against parasites which infect humans. Typical of the parasites which may most commonly be found in the digestive tracts of human beings are parasites of the genera Ancylostoma. Necator, Ascaris, Stronoyloides, Trichinella, CaPillaria, Trichuris and Enterobius. The compounds are also active against parasites of the genera Wuchereria, Brusia, Onchocerca and Loa of the family Filariidae which are found in blood, tissues and organs other than the digestive tract and are medically important . parasites of the genus Dracunculus and parasites of the genera Stronayloides and Trichinella. which especially infect the exointestinal canal. The form of the compositions of the invention and the nature of the carriers or diluents employed in them will vary depending upon the intended use of the composition. For example. where the compounds of the invention are to be employed as anthelmintics, they are preferably administered orally, parenterally or topically and the form of compositions chosen will be appropriate to the intended route of administration. For oral administration, the composition of the invention is preferably in the form of a liquid drink comprising a non toxic solution or suspension, preferably aqueous, of the active compound in admixture with a suspending agent such as bentonite , a wetting.agent or other diluents. The drink, in general, also contains an anti foaming agent. The active compound would normally be present in the drink in an amount of from 0.01 to 0.5 by weight, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.1 by weight. Compositions for oral administration may also be in the form of dry solids, preferably in unit dosage form.such as capsules, pills or tablets containing the desired amount of the active compound. These compositions may be prepared by mixing the active compound uniformly with suitable diluents. fillers, disintegrators and or binding agents, for example starch, lactose, talc, magnesium stearate and vegetable gum. The weight and contents of the preparation will vary widely, depending upon the nature of the animal to be treated, the degree of infection, the nature of the parasite and the body weight of the animal to be treated. The compounds may also be administered as an additive to animal feedstuffs, in which case they may be dispersed uniformly in the feedstuffs, used as a top dressing or used in the form of pellets. The content of active compound in the feedstuff is preferably from 0.0001 to 0.02 , in order to achieve the desired anthelmintic activity. For parenteral administration, the compound of the invention is preferably dissolved or suspended in a liquid vehicle, preferably a vegetable oil, such as peanut oil or cottonseed oil. Where the compound is a salt of a compound of formula II , the liquid vehicle may be water or another aqueous medium. Depending upon the animal to be treated, the injection may be subcutaneous or into the proventriculus, a muscle or the trachea. Such preparations would normally contain the active compound at a concentration of from 0.05 to 50 by weight. The compounds of the invention may also be administered topically in admixture with a suitable carrier, such as a hydrocarbon solvent. Such preparations would be applied directly to the outside of the animal by spraying e.g. by a hand spray or in spray races , by dipping e.g. in a plunge dip , by a pour on solution or. by manual methods e.g. hand dressing . The dose of active compound may be varied, depending upon the nature of the animal to be treated, and the nature and degree of parasitic infection. However, best results for oral administration are achieved when the dose is from 0.01 to 100 mg, more preferably from 0.5 to 50 mg, per 1 kg body weight. The compound may be administered in a single dose or in divided doses for a relatively short period, such as from 1 to 5 days. Where the composition of the invention is intended for agricultural or horticultural use, a variety of forms and formulations are possible. For example, it may be formulated as dusts. coarse dusts, soluble powders, microgranules, fine microgranules, wettable powders, dilute emulsions, emulsifiable concentrates, aqueous or oily suspensions or solutions which may be directly sprayable or for dilution , aerosols or capsules in, for example, polymeric substances. The carrier employed may be natural or synthetic and organic or inorganic it is generally employed to assist the active compound to reach the substrate to be treated, and to make it easier to store, transport or handle the active compound. Solid, liquid and gaseous carriers may be employed, chosen from carriers well known in the art for use with compositions of this type. Such formulations may be prepared by conventional means, e.g. by intimate mixing and or grinding of the active ingredients s with the carrier or diluent, e.g.solvent, solid carrier or, optionally, surface active agent. Suitable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably the C8 to C12 fractions from petroleum distillation, such as xylene mixtures or substituted naphthalenes esters of phthalic acid, such as dibutyl or dioctyl phthalate aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or the paraffins alcohols and glycols or esters thereof, such as ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether or ethylene glycol monoethyl ether ketones, such as cyclohexanone strongly polar solvents. such as N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulphoxide or N,N dimethylformamide optionally epoxidized vegetable oils, such as epoxidized coconut oil or soybean oil and water. Solid carriers, which may be used, for example, in dusts and dispersible powders, include natural mineral fillers, such as calcite, talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. In order to improve the physical properties of the composition, it is also possible to add highly dispersed silicic acid or highly dispersed absorbent polymers. Suitable granulated adsorptive carriers may be porous such as pumice, ground brick, sepiolite or bentonite or non porous such as calcite or sand . A wide variety of pregranulated materials, organic or inorganic. may also be used examples include dolomite and ground plant residues. Surface actve agents which may be used are well known in the art and may be non ionic, cationic or anionic agents having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. Mixtures of such agents may also be used. Compositions may also contain stabilizers, anti foaming agents, viscosity regulators, binders or adhesives or any combination thereof, as well as fertilizers or other active substances to achieve special effects. Pesticidal compositions will generally contain from 0.01 to 99 , more preferably from 0.1 to 95 , by weight of the active compound from 1 to 99.998 of a solid or liquid additive and from 0 to 25 , more preferably from 0.1 to 25 , of a surface active agent.Whereas commercial products are generally sold as concentrated compositions, they are generally diluted by the end user to a concentration of from 0.001 to 0.0001 by weight from 10 to 1 ppm .
