# Magnetic recording apparatus.

## Abstract
Magnetic recording apparatus wherein a latent magnetic image is produced on a magnetic recording medium which is composed of a ferromagnetic layer to be magnetized along a predetermined direction before forming the latent magnetic image and a magnetic layer of high permeability to be turned to paramagnetic by being subject to the heat of its heating head to its Curie point or above which are respectively laminated to the opposite sides of a base layer, the heating head being playced at the opposite side of the ferromagnetic layer not so as to make a contact thereto thereby to make the cleaning of the heating head unnecessary substantially while keeping the latent magnetic image to be of high quality. In the magnetic recording medium, direct current magnetic field of the opposite direction to the magnetized direction of the ferromagnetic layer or alternating current magnetic field the phase of which is reverse at positions corresponding to opposite ends of at least a paramagnetized part is applied to the paramagnetized part of the high permeable magnetic layer thereby to form a magnetic latent image on the ferromagnetic layer by the leakage of the magnetic flux from the paramagnetized part to the ferromagnetic layer.
