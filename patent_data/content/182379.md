# PLATING POLY ARYLENE SULFIDE SURFACES

## Abstract
Poly arylene sulfide substrates are laser treated, i.e., treated with a beam of laser radiation, and then contacted with plating solution. In a specific embodiment, laser treat ment imparts a specific pattern on the poly arylene sulfide substrate, which is then subjected to an electroless plating solution to give a printed circuit board.
