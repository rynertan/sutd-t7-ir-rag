# High temperature liquid crystal substances having four rings and liquid crystal compositions containing the same.

## Abstract
Liquid crystal compounds which exhibit a liquid crystal phase within a broad temperature range and have a high clearing point and nevertheless a low viscosity, and liquid crystal compositions containing the same are provided, which liquid crystal compounds have positive dielectric anisotropy values and are expressed by the general formula
