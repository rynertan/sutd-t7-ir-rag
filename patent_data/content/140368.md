## Description
The present invention relates to a read only memory device, the content of which can be programmed electrically, that is, a programmable read only memory device hereinafter simply called as a P ROM . More particularly, the present invention relates to a test circuit for checking whether or not programming data into P ROM can be conducted without failure. Recently, P ROM has been gained an extremely wide range of applications in the field of data processing and control because of its advantage in that a user can freely program the data thereinto. So called junction destruction type and fuse type P ROM s are well known as bipolar P ROM s. The junction destruction type P ROM includes memory cells arrayed in a matrix form and each consisting of one bipolar transistor of a base open type, which has a collector and an emitter connected to one row line and one column line, respectively. To program data in the P ROM of this type is performed by supplying a considerably large programming current to the selected memory cell to destroy, i.e., short circuit the base emitter junction of the cell transistor. As a result, the transistor of the programmed memory cell operates merely as a diode to allow a reading out current to flow from the column line to the row line in data read out operation. On the other hand, the base emitter junction of the transistor in the non programmed memory cells prevents the current from flowing from the column to row lines. In the fuse type P ROM, each memory cell consists of a fuse and a diode connected in series between each column line and each row line. The data program in this type is carried out by supplying a programming current to the selected memory cell to melt the fuse. In the read out operation, the reading out current does not flow from the selected column line to the selected row line, when the programmed memory cell is disposed at the intersection of the selected column and row lines. If the selected memory cell is not programmed, the reading out current flows between the column and row lines. The fuse type P ROM is, however, disadvantageous in that the melted fuse is scattered over the surface of the P ROM chip to adversely affect the electrical performances of the P ROM. The junction destraction type P ROM is preferable in this respect. It will be apparent that a P ROM without any programmed cell should be offered to users. Accordingly, any defectiveness in the P ROM does not appear until the programming is done by the user, who finds that the data program cannot be correctly performed. The mal function of peripheral circuits or the defect in the memory cells themselves may make the data program impossible. However, even where the peripheral circuits and the memory cells have no defect, there occurs a phenomenon that the data program cannot be correctly carried out to the P ROM of the junction destruction type. This phenomenon becomes remarkable as the memory capacity of the P ROM increases. It has been discovered that the cause of the phenomenon is a parasitic thyristor effect based on a particular geometrical relationship among the programmed and unprogrammed cells in the memory cell array. The parasitic thyristor effect occurs when the programmed and unprogrammed cells determined by the user take the particular geometrical relationship. A memory cell according to the preamble part of claim 1 is disclosed in EP A 0 055 918. This reference relates to programmable read only memory employing base open transistors as memory cells in which further a test cell arrangement including two test word lines is provided. The tests to be performed are to check the defectiveness of a memory cell array and operations of peripheral circuits such as address decoders, an output circuit and so on, and it is not apparent in which way the occurrence of parasitic effects may be checked. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a programmable read only memory device in which the occurrence of a parasitic thyristor effect is detectable. This object is achieved by a memory circuit having the features of claim 1 the dependent claims are related to further developments of the invention. The P ROM according to the present invention is thus provided with the test circuit for detecting the occurrence of a parasitic thyristor effect. According to the inventors finding, the paracitic thyristor effect occurs in four memory cells which are disposed at the respective intersections of the adjacent two row lines and the adjacent two column lines, when first and second memory cells positioned on one diagonal line are programmed and third and fourth memory cells positioned on the other diagonal line are not yet programmed. The first and second transistors respectively constituting the first and second memory cells then operate merely as diodes. When the third memory cell is to be programmed, the row and column lines between which the third memory cell is coupled are selected to supply a programming current to the third memory cell through the selected column line. It should be noted that the diodes of the first and second memory cells and the fourth transistor constituting the fourth memory cell are coupled in series between the selected row and column lines. The collectors of the second and fourth transistors are common to form the column line to which the second and fourth memory cells are connected, and hence the device structure of the part including the second and fourth transistors is equivalent to a P N P N thyristor structure. In other words, a parasitic lateral transistor formed of the base of the second transistor with the emitter being short circuited to the base by programming, the common collector and the base of the fourth transistor and a vertical transistor formed by the common collector, the base and the emitter of the fourth transistor consitutes the parasitic thyristor. If the product of current gains of these lateral and vertical transistors is more than 1, the parasitic thyristor is made conductive by the programming current. As a result, the programming current supplied to the selected column line flows, not through the selected third transistor to be programmed, but through the first, second and fourth transistors to the selected row line. The program of the third memory cell is thereby impossible. With the test circuit according to the present invention, the first additional row line is selected by the third means and the second one of the column lines is selected by the second means. A current is supplied to the second one of the column lines. Since the first additional row line is disconnected from the second one of the column lines, the current does not flow to the first additional row line if the thyristor effect does not occur. However, if the parasitic thyristor formed by the second diode and the additional transistor is made conductive, the current will flow from the second column line to the first additional row line through the first and second diodes and the additional transistor. This means that the parasitic thyristor effect may also occur in the memory cell array upon the data programming by the user. Thus, the defectiveness in the P ROM caused by the parasitic thyristor effect can be detected prior to the shipment of P ROMs. It is favorable that the first and second diodes are formed of the base collector junction of a transistor. Further, the distance between the anode region of the second diode and the base region of the additional transistor is favorably shorter than that between the base regions of the adjacent two memory cells connected to the same row lines in order to increase the sensitivity of detecting the parasitic thyristor effect by the test circuit. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which With reference to Figs. 1 to 5, the defectiveness in the data programming caused by a parasitic thyristor effect made clear by the inventor will be described in detail in order to facilitate the understanding of the features and advantages of the present invention. Fig. 1 shows one memory cell in a P ROM of the junction destruction type, which consists of one NPN transistor Q. The transistor Q has a collector region 1 of an N type, a base region 2 of a P type and an emitter region 3 of an N type, as shown in Figs. 1B and 1C. The collector 1 is connected to one row line X and the emitter 3 is connected to one column line Y, but the base 2 is in an open state, as shown in Fig. 1A. The transistor Q is programmed by supplying a programming current PI from the column line Y to the row line X through the transistor Q. The base emitter junction of the transistor Q is subjected to be destroyed, i.e., to be short circuited by the programming current PI. On the other hand, the base collector junction is not destroyed, since the programming current PI flows thereinto in a forward bias direction. As a result, the programmed transistor Q operates as a diode formed of the base collector junction. The equivalent circuit, a plan view and a cross sectional view of the programmed memory cell are shown in Figs. 2A, 2B and 2C, respectively. In Fig. 2A, a resistor R connected between the emitter and base of the transistor Q represents the short circuit of the base emitter junction. Further, fat lines written across the base emitter junction in Figs. 2B and 2C also indicate the short circuit thereof. Referring to Fig. 3, there is shown a memory cell array 10 in the P ROM of the junction destruction type. The memory cell array 10 includes a plurality of row and column lines X₁ to X More specifically, the collectors of the transistors Q₁₁ and Q₁₂ and Q₁₃ to Q In Fig. 5, a transistor PQ₁ is a parasitic lateral PNP transistor formed of the P type region 212, N type region 211 and P type region 222, and a transistor PQ₂ is a vertical NPN transistor formed of the N type region 211, P type region 222 and N type region 223 which is equivalent to the transistor Q₂₂ . If the product of current gains of the transistors PQ₁ and PQ₂ is more than 1, the parasitic thyristor 150 constituted by the transistors PQ₁ and PQ₂ is made conductive by a programming power to be used for programming the transistor Q₁₁. As a result, the programming current fed from the column line Y₁ flows through the parasitic thyristor 150 and the transistor Q₁₂ into the row line X₁. In other words, the programming of the transistor Q₁₁ is not carried out. The product of current gains of the transistors PQ₁ and PQ₂ may be designed to be less than 1 by lengthening the distance between the base regions of the adjacent two cell transistors and or doping impuries serving as a life time killer into the respective N type regions operating as the row lines. However, the distance between the base regions as well as the doping quantity of the impurities are deviated from the designed value due to the variation in the manufacturing conditions of the device. In addition, the distance between the base regions should be made short in order to obtain a large memory capacity. This means that the current gain of the parasitic lateral transistor PQ₁ is increased. Accordingly, it is not guaranteed that the parasitic thyristor effect is prevented. The parasitic thyristor effect does not appear until the user carries out the data programming. In order to previously remove P ROMs in which the parasitic thyristor effect may occur, a test cell array 200 is provided in P ROM according to an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig. 6. The test cell array 200 is disposed separately from the memory cell array 10 for the user s use, and includes two additional row lines X Fig. 7 shows a partial plan view of the device structure in the test cell array 200 and a portion of the memory cell array 10. The cross sectional views along the lines A A and B B of Fig. 7 are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. An N type region 250 serves as the collector regions of the transistor Q As apparent from Fig. 9, a pair of diode and transistor which are adjacent to each other, i.e., D₂₁ and Q In the test mode, the column line Y₁ and the first additional row line X Moreover, as apparent from Fig. 7, the distance between the anode region 257, 260, 263, .... of the respective diode D₂₁ to D In a case where the column line Y₃ and the first additional row line X Fig. 10 shows a block diagram of a P ROM according to the present invention. This P ROM is formed as an integrated circuit device 300 which has row address signal input terminalsRA₁ to RA In a test mode for testing whether the parasitic thyristor effect occurs or not in the test cell array 200, any one of the row lines X₁ to X Since the second additional row line X As described above in detail, the present invention provides a P ROM in which the defectiveness in the data programming operation caused by the parasitic thyristor effect is detected before the user performs the data programming. Furthermore, the embodiment of Fig. 10 may be modified in that the memory cell array 10 and the test cell array 200 may be provided plurally to output a plurality of data simultaneously.
