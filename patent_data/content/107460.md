# METHOD OF CONSTRUCTING CONCRETE STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A concrete structure is constructed by attaching metal nets 8 to opposite sides of support members 2 to form a frame work. Concrete is poured into the framework and the support member is removed after the concrete has set. The nets 8 are attached by pins 9 extending into holes in the support members 2, or by lugs 19 pressed out ofthe support members 2, for example.
