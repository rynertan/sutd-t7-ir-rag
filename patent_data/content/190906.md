# Apparatus for transferring articles.

## Abstract
An apparatus for transferring articles comprises a first conveyor 3 for conveying articles 1 at a constant speed, a detecting unit 4 disposed at a predetermined location above the first conveyor 3 and arranged to detect the articles being conveyed therealong, a second conveyor 5 for conveying at a variable speed uniformly spaced trays 2 , the second conveyor being disposed generally below a delivery end of the first conveyor so that articles are deposited on the trays. A rotary encoder 8 is coupled to the second conveyor and a control device 10 receives informa tion from the detecting unit 4 , information from the rotary encoder 8 , and information concerning desired locations where articles are intended to be placed on the trays. The control device 10 controls the speed of the second con veyor on the basis of such information, whereby the articles are automatically transferred onto the trays at said desired location.
