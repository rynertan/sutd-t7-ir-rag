## Description
THERMALLY STABLE POLYOLEFIN COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION The present invention relates to a polyolefin composition comprising a polyolefin and an inorganic filler, which has improved thermal oxidative stability.The invention further relates to a process for thermally stabilizing a polyolefin composition. While compositions of polyolefins incorporated with inorganic fillers have been developed and put into practice in order to improve mechanical properties and thermal properties of the polyolefins, their thermal properties are not adequate. There have heretofore been proposed many methods of improving properties of polyolefin compositions containing inorganic fillers.Those proposed are, for example, a method to improve physical properties, such as impact strength, of molded products by incorporating a thermally stable filler obtained by coating a powder of an inorganic compound with a fatty acid ester of a polyhydric alcohol Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 49254 1977 , a method to improve rigidity, impact resistance, thermal aging resistance and heat resisting properties of molded products by adding an inorganic filler based on barium sulfate, talc etc., together with a glycerin fatty acid ester to a crystalline polypropylene resin Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 80345 1977 and so forth However, heat resistant stability cannot be fully improved with these known methods. This invention seeks to overcome these disadvantages inherent in the hitherto known polyolefin compositions containing inorganic fillers, and is based on the discovery that incorporation of stabilizing amounts of a phenol type antioxidant, a sulfur type antioxidant and a fatty acid ester of a neopentyl type polyhydric alcohol into a mixture of a polyolefin and an inorganic filler provides a polyolefin composition protected from coloring and having excellent heat stability. In other words, it is a thermally stable polyolefin composition which comprises a polyolefin, an inorganic filler and thermally stabilizing amounts of each of A a hindered phenol type antioxidant, B a sulfur type antioxidant and C a fatty acid ester of a neopentyl type polyhydric alcohol. The amounts of A , B and C are preferably about 0.01 to about 5 parts by weight, about 0.02 to about 10 parts by weight and about 0.05 to about 5 parts by weight respectively per 100 parts by weight of a mixture of polyolefin and inorganic filler. The polyolefin in the present invention can be a homopolymer of an alpha olefin having 2 to 6 carbon atoms or a copolymer thereof, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene l, poly 4 methyl pentene l, an ethylene propylene random copolymer, an ethylene propylene block copolymer, etc. The inorganic filler in the present inventioncan be any of the various fillers used as fillers for polyolefins, for example, silicate minerals, such as ta , asbestos, mica powder, kaolin, pagodite, diatomaceous earth, calcium silicate, magnesium silicate, aluminum silicate, etc. sulfates such as barium.sulfate, calcium sulfate, etc. metal oxides such as titanium oxide, silica, alumina, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, etc. hydroxides such as aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, etc. and carbonates such as calcium carbonate, magensium carbonate, etc. The particle size of the inorganic filler is suitably such that the average particle diameter is in the range of 0.1 to 30, especially that of 1 to 15 cm being preferred for its good dispersibility. The hindered phenol type antioxidant employed in the present invention is a compound having a structure in which a tertiary alkyl group is introduced into the ortho position to the OH group of the phenol derivative, and can be, for example, 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene, tetrakis tmethylene 3 3 ,5 ditert butyl hydroxyphenyl propionate methane, 1,1,3 tris 2methyl 4 hydroxy 5 tert butylphenyl butane, 2,6 di tert butyl p cresol, 2,2 methylenebis methyl 6 tert butylphenol , 4,4 butylidenebis 3 methyl 6 tert butyl phenol , 4,4 thiobis 3methyl 6 tert butylphenol , stearyl beta 3,5 di tert butyl 4hydroxyphenol propionate, 1,3,5 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4hydroxybenzyl isocyanurate, 2,4 bis n octylthio 6 4hydroxy 3,5 di tert butylanilino 1,3,5 triazine, 2,4 bis 4hydroxy 3,5 di tert butylphenoxy 6 n octylthio 1,3,Striazine and so forth. The sulfur type antioxidant employed in the present invention can be a sulfide, especially an ester of sulfide carboxylic acid or an ester of a hydroxyl substituted sulfide, and preferred examples of the ester of the sulfide carboxylic acid include dimyristyl thiodipropionate, distearyl thiodipropionate, dilauryl thiodipropionate, lauryl stearyl thiodipropionate, diabietyl thiodipropionate, etc. The fatty acid ester of the neopentyl type polyhydric alcohol employed in accordance with the present invention can be, for example, an ester or partial ester of pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane, trimethylolethane, neopenetyl glycol, dipentaerythritol, dineopentyl glycol or the like, either alone or as mixtures thereof, with a saturated fatty acid having 6 to 22, preferably 12 to 18, carbon atoms, for exmaple, lauric acid, tridecylic acid, myristic acid, pentadecylic acid, palmitic acid, hepta decylic acid, stearic acid or the like, either alone or as a mixture thereof. The fatty acid ester of the neopentyl type polyhydric alcohol may be in the structure of either a complete ester in which all the hydroxyl groups in the alcohol are ester bonded or a partial ester in which a part of the hydroxyl groups are ester bonded, or a mixture thereof, among which especially preferred is a single ester which is a di or higher ester or a mixture the average degree of esterification of which equals to a diester or higher. A representative example of the fatty acid ester of the neopentyl type polyhydric alcohol used in the present invention is stearic acid ester of pentaerylthritol. The mixing proportion of the polyolefin and the inorganic filler in the thermally stable polyolefin composition in accordance with the present invention is about 5 to about 150 parts by weight, preferably 25 to 100 parts by weight, of the inorganic filler per 100 parts by weight of the polyolefin. Further, the mixing proportion of the hindered phenol type antioxidant, the sulfur type antioxidant and the fatty acid ester of the neopentyl type polyhydric alcohol is preferably about 0.01 to about 5 parts by weight, and especially about 0.02 to about 2 parts by weight, of the hindered phenol type antioxidant, preferably about 0.02 to about 10 parts by weight, and especially about 0.03 to about 4 parts per weight, of the sulfur type antioxidant and preferably about 0.05 to about 5 parts by weight, especially about 0.2 to about 2 parts by weight of the fatty acid ester of the neopentyl type polyhydric alcohol are used per 100 parts by weight of a mixture of the polyolefin and the inorganic filler. The thermally stable polyolefin composition in accordance with the present invention may be obtained by mixing and kneading the aforementioned polyolefin, inorganic filler, hindered phenol type antioxidant, sulfur type antioxidant and fatty acid ester of the neopentyl type polyhydric alcohol at the above specified mixing proportion. The kneading method, for example, the order of mixing and the manner of mixing, is not especially restricted and conventional kneading methods may be applied. For example, a method to simultaneously mix the respective ingredients using a mixer such as a Henschel mixer, twin cylinder mixer, ribbon blender, tumbler, etc. and melt knead the resulting mixture using a Banbury mixer, monoaxial or multi axial extruder, etc., is employed on the industrial basis.Alternatively, it is also possible to employ a method to add the inorganic filler and the fatty acid ester of the neopentyl type polyhydric alcohol to a composition obtained by melt kneading the polyolefin and the antioxidants, and mix them, followed by melt kneading, or a method to mix and melt knead the fatty acid ester of the neopentyl type polyhydric alcohol, the respective antioxidants and a part of the polyolefin to obtain a composition and successively add the remainder of the polyolefin and the inorganic filler thereto, followed by melt kneading. The composition in accordance with the present invention can contain other additives conventionally employed for polyolefins, such as a pigment, ultraviolet absorber, antistatic agent, neutralizing agent, etc. The polyolefin compositions of this invention can be employed in the manufacture of articles for use in the automotive industry, such as fender filler plates, fan belt shields and in the appliance industry, such as for fan blades for dishwashers and the like. The present invention will be more particularly described in the following Examples and Comparative Examples.Examples 1 3 and Comparative Examples 1 4 One hundred parts by weight of a crystalline polypropylene powder having a melt flow rate of 11.0 was mixed with 67 parts by weight of a talc powder of an average particle diameter of 12fi , and 100 parts by weight each of this mixture was mixed with a hindered phenol type antioxidant tl,3,5 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl iso cyanurate , a sulfur type antioxidant dimyristyl thiodipropionate and stearic acid ester of pentaerythritol main component stearic acid diester at the mixing proportion specified in Table 1, followed by mixing in a Henschel mixer.
