# Balanced active mixer circuit.

## Abstract
A singly balanced active mixer circuit is disclosed for developing an IF signal by combining a RF signal and a local oscillator LO signal. The RF and LO signals are applied to a strip transmission line ring 100 which pro vides balanced components of the LO signal to a pair of active devices 120, 121 arranged in a singly balanced active mixer. The active devices 120, 121 are coupled directly, or via a balanced PI network 129 131 to the primary winding of an output transformer 132 for applica tion to the following IF stage of the radio receiver. The singly balanced active mixer circuit may be advantageously utilized in a radio having a receiver with broadband front end RF selectivity.
