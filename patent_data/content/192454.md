# Process for preparing High strength cellulosic fibers.

## Abstract
High strength, high modulus cellulose triacetate fibers are produced by spinning a 30 50 by weight solution of cellulose triacetate having an acetyl content of at least 42.5 and an inherent viscosity of at least 5 from a solvent mixture comprising nitric acid and another solvent having a molecu lar weight of less than 160 in a mol ratio of 1 3 through an air gap into a coagulating bath.
