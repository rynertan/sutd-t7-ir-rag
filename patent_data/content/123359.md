# Electroacoustic transducer unit with reduced resonant frequency and mechanical spring with negative stiffness, preferably used in such a transducer unit.

## Abstract
An electroacoustic tranducer unit comprises an elec troacoustic transducer including a diaphragm. This may be for example an electrodynamic transducer with a diaphragm 1 , a magnet system 2 with an air gap 3 , a voice coil former 4 such a voice coil 5 arranged on this coil former in the air gap 3 of the magnet system 2 . The transducer unit com prises means for reducing the resonant frequency of the transducer in the form of mechanical springs with negative spring stiffness 9 and 10 , which springs are each coupled between a stationary part 11 or 8 respectively of the trans ducer unit and movable part, for example the voice coil former 4 or the diaphragm 1 of the transducer. Further, the transducer unit comprises a control device 42 for correcting the position of the diaphragm 1 under the influence of a control signal 43 generated by the control device. The mechanical spring with negative spring stiffness comprises two blade springs of which both ends are coupled to each other and which, under the influence of a compressive force F which acts in a direction along an imaginary line through both ends of the mechanical spring, are each bent in one or two opposite directions. Such springs may also be employed for different purposes.
