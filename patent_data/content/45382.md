# A method of operating an ink jet printer and a drop on demand ink jet printer.

## Abstract
The drawing shows part of the print head and associated drive circuitry of an ink jet printer. The head comprises a tubular piezo electric transducer 11, 12, 13b driven from a periodic source 37 running at the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric cavity 17 or from a clock source 46 gated by print signals. During driving by source 37 the transducer is energized with a series of pulses for a preselected short time period delay 39 and at a repetition rate substantially equal to a resonant frequency of the ink cavity 17 . This effectively purges any entrapped air from the ink system. Except during purging, the transducer operates asynchronously in drop on demand mode in response to discrete binary print signals. Purging is accomplished automatically as a part of the start up operation and also if, during operation, the velocity Vâ‚… of the ink droplets 26 , as sensed by a sensor 41 , drops below a preselected reference value V
