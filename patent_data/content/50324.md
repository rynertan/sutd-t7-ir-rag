# Method and apparatus for producing high purity silicon from flames of alkalimetal and silicon halide.

## Abstract
Vaporized silicon tetrachloride is mixed with vaporized sodium in an exothermic reaction producing liquid silicon droplets and gaseous sodium chloride which are subsequently separated in an efficient manner. Separation of the silicon from the salt by products is performed by a jet impaction separation technique wherein the products of the complete reaction between sodium and silicon tetrachloride are made to exit from a small hole 24 in the reactor 12 into a region held at a pressure less than half of the reactor pressure, A supersonic jet is thus formed which impinges upon a surface so that the direction of flow of the gas changes abruptly. The silicon droplets, however, are carried by their large forward momentum onto the surface where they are deposited. The salt vapor is then made to flow away from the depositing area and is passed over cooled surfaces where it is made to condense. Modifications of the basic technique allow the silicon to be collected in a variety of physical configurations including pellet form, crystal form, sheet form and ingot form.

## Description
Background of the invention 1. Field of the inventionThis invention relates to a method and apparatus for producing high purity silicon from a flame of sodium and silicon tetrachloride and separating the liquid sodium from the sodium chloride by products in an efficient and contamination free manner.2. Description of the prior ArtA variety of attempts have been made recently to produce inexpensive yet high quality semiconductor and photovoltaic silicon for commercial purposes. The Hemlock process starts with SiH2Cl2 to produce a semiconductor grade silicon in rod form. The Battelle Memorial Institute process employs silicon tetrachloride and zinc in a fluidized bed to produce solar grade silicon in pellet form.The Union Carbide Corporation has a process involving the decomposition of SiH4 to produce semiconductor silicon in powdered form. The foregoing processes all suffer from at least one of the following problems Firstly, the end product silicon is relatively expensive or, secondly, the effectiveness of the process has not been demonstrated or, thirdly, there remains a high level of unacceptable impurities in the final silicon products.The Preparation of mono and poly crystalline silicon by techniques involving the reaction of silicon tetrachloride with a metal reductant such as sodium are known in the art. Thus, for example, U S A 4 102 767 discloses the preparation of single crystals of silicon from a poly crystalline sheet or mass formed from the reaction of silicon tetrachloride and sodium in an arc furnace. U S A 4 102 765 similarly discloses the preparation of high purity silicon by tangentially projecting a silicon halide and an alkali metal into a reaction chamber after the aforementioned reactants have been injected into an electric arc heater. The projection of the reaction mixtures causes the silicon to separate from the metal halide salt, after which the silicon is deposited on a downwardly extending surface to permit it to flow into an associated receptacle. U S A 4 102 765 relies on centrifugal force for the separation of the salt from the purified silicon.The above techniques have their drawbacks, as the operating temperatures of over 1800 OK tend to cause the reaction apparatus to break down with high frequency. Also, the sodium chloride by product of the reaction is difficult to separate from the silicon and the silicon is therefore of insufficient purity for contemporary uses such as photovoltaic applications. Moreover, the energy requirements of the arc heaters used to heat large amounts of arc gas and subsequently the reactants are unnecessary. It is likely that none of the earlier experimental work recognized the exothermic nature of the reaction and its significance.Additionally, research by the present inventors has attempted to learn if the sodium silicon tetrachloride reaction could be controlled so as to produce inexpensive high purity silicon. Some of the initial experimental and theoretical results were reported in the reports of limited distribution. The earliest report is entitled Silicon Halide Alkali Metal Flames as a Source of SolarGrade Silicon by D.B. Olson and R.K. Gould issued April 1979 and identified as Serial No. DOE JPL 954777 79 7 distribution category UC 63 . Also of interest is theU.S. Department of Energy Report entitled Development of a Model and Computer Code to Describe Solar Grade SiliconProduction Processes by R. Srivastava and R.K. Gould dated May 1979 under Serial No. DOE JPL 954 862 6.Further experimentation indicated that the process could be made viable, and in particular, that cheap and effective separation of the silicon from the salt could be achieved.Summary of the inventionIn accordance with the present invention, a method and apparatus for preparing purified silicon is disclosed.The method comprises vaporizing a silicon halide, such as silicon tetrachloride, and an appropriate reducing metal such as sodium, and mixing the two vaporized materials in a reaction chamber to form the reaction products of gaseous sodium chloride and liquid silicon. The reaction may take place at a temperature approximating the melting point of silicon, and, in one embodiment may range from approximately 1412 1600 OC. 112 C is the inventor s best es stmate of the initial melting point of Si and is used herein merely to suggest that point. The reaction is performed at pressures which may range up to about one atmosphere absolute , and preferably ranges from 0.1 0.5 atmospheres.Under these moderate pressures, the silicon liquifies, while the sodium salt remains in the gaseous state. Other impurities form salts such as BCl3 and PCl3 which are separated from the Si. Experiments show that many common impurities such as B and P concentrate in salt rather than Si resulting in a more pure Si than otherwise might be expected.A further feature of the present method relates to the collection of the liquid silicon. The liquid silicon is released from the reaction chamber through a small hole, into a separation chamber maintained at a pressure of less than one half that of the reactor, so that the reaction products form a supersonic jet. While a supersonic jet is preferred it may be possible for the process to work in the subsonic range just below the supersonic and therefore.the use of the ter supersonic is meant to comprehend the marginal subsonic range as well. The preferred pressure range of the separation chamber is from 0.001 0.1 atmosphere. The supersonic jet is then caused to impinge upon a surface whereupon the silicon droplets in the jet deposit and purified liquid silicon is collected.The salt vapor easily separates from the silicon jet, and can be drawn off by the action of an appropriate pumping means, or by the circulation of a sweeper gas medium.The apparatus of the present invention comprises a reactor having reactant inlet ports for the injection of the gaseous reactants, and electrical heating means for raising and maintaining the temperature of said reactor within the range set forth above. Heat from the preheating means is required only at a start up phase of the process and not after the process has been initiated. The reactor includes an exit port or nozzle means of a size effective to promote the formation of the supersonic jet of said liquid silicon. The present apparatus includes a separate means which may, in one embodiment, comprise a heated surface against which the supersonic jet of said liquid silicon may impinge. Preferably, the separator means is maintained in an atmosphere having a pressure lower than that of said reactor means all as set forth with reference to the method above. Separation of the liquid silicon and the vaporized salt occurs by the impaction of the silicon droplets upon the separator means which may, in one embodiment, be maintained at a predetermined distance from said nozzle means related to the orifice size of the latter.The apparatus of the present invention further includes a collection means for receiving the separated liquid silicon. The collection means may comprise a crucible or dish, or a planar surface or any other vessel of suitable geometry.The apparatus of the present invention is adapted for operation in either the vertical or horizontal position. In one embodiment, the apparatus may be disposed so that the supersonic jet containing liquid silicon droplets is forced to flow in the horizontal direction against the separator means causing the droplets to condense to the liquid phase. In this embodiment, the separated liquid silicon flows downward, aided by the force of gravity, and is collected in an appropriate collection means, while the salt by product, in the gaseous form, flows upward and away from the point of impaction on the surface of the separator means and is subsequently condensed.In a yet further embodiment, the reactor means may define a plurality of nozzle means, in the instance where the reactor is of sufficient size, to facilitate commercial scale production of purified silicon. Alternatively the nozzle means may comprise an elongated slit or a plurality of slots.The apparatus and method described herein not only permit an expensive high purity silicon to be produced, but also allows for the silicon to be collected in a variety of convenient forms, including pellets, single crystals, sheets and ingots.Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for preparing high purity silicon from the reaction of a silicon halide and an alkali metal, whereby the separation of the silicon product from the resulting alkali salt results in the recovery of a high purity consolidated metallic silicon product. The separation process is also a purification process since impurities such as B and P are simultaneously removed as salts from the Si. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus as aforesaid which operates with a high throughput and efficiently at a reduced energy expenditure.It is a yet further object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus as aforesaid which facilitates the collection of the purified silicon product in a variety of forms, such as pellets, single crystals, sheets and ingots.Other objects and advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the ensuing description which proceeds with reference to the following illustrative drawings.Brief description of the drawingsFigure 1 illustrates a prior art apparatus in which the silicon particles are collected in a simple hollow crucible.Figure 2 illustrates an apparatus in which the collector includes a stationary impact surface near the reaction exhaust.Figure 3 is a schematic illustration of the set of preferred operating conditions of the invention.Figure 4 is a schematic representation of the energy balances of the process.Figure 5 is a flow diagram of the process according to one embodiment of the invention.Figure 6 illustrates the basic jet impaction process in which the liquid silicon is separated from the salt vapor and other impurities.

However, SiCl4 and Na are believed to be the only economical materials suitable for use in this invention. In one embodiment silicon tetrachloride and sodium are vaporized at about one atmosphere, at temperatures of 60 OC and 900 OC respectively. The vaporation of the reactants provides an opportunity to prepurify them, and also supplies the enthalpy to keep the reaction temperature well above the dew point of the salt by product.The vapors of the reactants are mixed in the reactor means or reaction chamber which operates at a wall temperature ranging from about 1412 OC to 1600 OC, and an ambient pressure of from about 0.1 to about 0.5 atmospheres. In a particular embodiment, the reactor may be operated at a temperature of 1500 OC and a pressure of 0.25 atmospheres. The reaction that occurs between the silicon halide and the alkali metal is extremely rapid and exothermic. For example, the reaction between silicon tetrachloride and sodium in the vapor state proceeds as follows. 4Na SiCl4 Si 4NaClThis reaction exhibits heats of reaction at 298 K and 1800 K which are Ash298 235 Kcal mol 1 and ash1800 110 Kcal mol respectively. The adiabatic flame temperature, depending on pressure, lies in the range 2200 2500 K, but the intense thermal emission from the silicon droplet fume in actual systems quickly drops the temperature. The preferred operating range of the reactor means facilitates the separation of the reaction products, as the sodium chloride and other im purity chlorides such als BC13 and PCl3 remain in the vaporized or gaseous state, while the silicon exists as a liquid.Were the reaction to take place in a cool reactor means, sodium chloride would condense, and silicon and sodium chloride would then rapidly freeze so that the resulting product would be a very fine brown powder made up of 90 by weight salt particles and 10 by weight submicron sized silicon particles.After the reaction products are formed in the reactor means, the liquid silicon in a droplet fume mixed with sodium chloride vapor exhausts from the reactor means through the orifice of a nozzle means discussed in greater detail later on, into a silicon collection region or separation chamber maintained at a pressure less than one half that of the pressure of the reactor means, so that the silicon stream forms a supersonic jet. The supersonic jet of liquid silicon attains a speed approximately 5 x 10 cm sec 1 or greater Mach Number Greater than 1.0 and impinges upon a liquid silicon surface, where the silicon droplets are collected by impaction.The reduced pressure of the separation zone compared to the pressure in the reactor contributes to the formation of the supersonic jet, and may, in one embodiment, range in pressure from 0.001 to 0.1 atmosphere. In a preferred embodiment, the ambient pressure in this separation region was 0.02 atmosphere. As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the supersonic jet of liquid silicon droplets impinged upon a separator means located in spaced apart, adjacent disposition to the nozzle means of the reactor. The jet has, assuming chemical equilibrium, a temperature of about 1177 OC, at which temperature, the silicon is frozen, and a velocity of 1.0 x 105 cm s 1 is attained.Just before reaching the separation means, however, the jet passes through a strong shock after which, it approaches equilibrium, about two thirds of the silicon is remelted, and a gas temperature of about 1412 OC is attained and a pressure somewhat less than half that of the reactor means prevails. More particularly, the se parator means is heated to a surface temperature of from 1412 to 1500 C, and in particular, a temperature range of 1420 OC is favorably maintained. The foregoing condi tions cause a rapidly growing, partially fused deposit of silicon to develop, fed by the impacting silicon drop lets from the jet.In the instance where a collector means or collector surface is maintained apart from the separator means, if the collector surface is maintained at a temperature of about 1412 C, a deposit of liquid silicon continually flows with assistance from gravity or from the jet away from the impaction area on the se paration means, and deposits on the collection means. Since the molten silicon product is held at lower pressu res and is flushed with chlorine containing by product gases which tend to volatize most contaminants, it is believed that further purification occurs here. The so dium chloride, which remains a gas throughout the jet expansion and silicon collection steps is easily diverted from the product, and may in one embodiment, be permitted to condence on the walls of the water cooled vacuum en velope that surrounds the process vessel. Figures 3 and 4 further illustrate and describe, in gra phical form, a nominal set of operating parameters of the process of the present invention. Figure 5 is a flow diagram of the process. The nominal parameters of the jet impaction described above, are also illustrated in Figure 6.An apparatus 10 representative of an early model made by the inventors is illustrated in Figure 1. Vaporous sodium is led into the reaction chamber of reactor 12 through inlet tube 20. Similarly, vaporous silicon tetrachloride is introduced into the reaction chamber through tube 22. Reactor 12 is constructed from graphite to withstand the high temperatures of operation. Initially, pre heaters 16 are energized to prevent an initial build up of products in a cold reactor. The product of the reaction, namely, liquid silicon droplets, and the vaporous salt exit through nozzle 24. The liquid silicon is collected in crucible 14 and the gaseous salt drawn off and condensed.Insulation 18 is provided to contain the heat of the exothermic reaction.Though theoretically operable, the apparatus of Figure 1 is unable to separate the silicon from the salt vapor to permit silicon of the desired purity to be recovered. It is believed that the force of the stream of liquid silicon exiting from nozzle 24 becomes dissipated, and that this inhibits the collection of pure silicon.In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus for producing high purity silicon comprises a reactor means having a nozzle means disposed thereon for the outflow of a jet of salt vapor containing liquid silicon, a separator means located near but separated by a distance from said nozzle means to receive the super sonic jet of liquid silicon on its surface, and a separate collection means disposed adjacent to said separator means to receive the liquid silicon after it impacts said separator means.An apparatus in accordance with the invention 30 is illustrated in Figure 2 where a separate surface 40 is placed near but separated from nozzle 24 by a predetermined distance so that the jet of liquid silicon may impinge upon it. Silicon is separated from the salt by impaction upon separator surface 40, and is forced to flow into a silicon collector by gravity or by the shear force exhibited by salt vapors passing over it.In the embodiment of Figure 2, separator surface 40 is located on a pedestal 42 placed in the center of a silicon collector crucible 14. Experiments with this separa tor collector combination indicate that high separation efficiencies i.e. ratio of silicon separated and collected to silicon produced in the reactor in the neighbor hood of 80 or more are possible. By contrast, the deep crucible approach illustrated in Figure 1 showed separation efficiencies of less than 50 .The embodiment of Figure 2 is housed within a process vessel 32 having a viewing port 34 therein. Power to the preheat element 16 is applied through contact 36. A pump, not shown in that figure but shown in other figures is connected to outlet pipe 38 and serves to draw off noncondensible gases such as small amounts of unreactedSiCl4 or argon used to direct flows or sweep viewing ports clean. Heat shields 44 insulate the device.The apparatus of the present invention utilizes the separator means or separator surface 40, maintaining it at a specific distance from the orifice of the nozzle means.Preferably, the separator means 40 may be disposed a distance of less than 10 nozzle means orifice diameters away from the nozzle means, in order to retain the favorable effects of impaction of the supersonic jet of liquid silicon upon the surface of the separator means. For example, the orifice diameter of the nozzle means may range from about 0.3 to about 1.4 centimeters, while the distance between the nozzle means and the separator means may range from about 1.0 to 10.0 centimeters. More particularly, the orifice diameter of the nozzle means may be 0.7 centimeters, and the distance between the nozzle means and the separator means may be 3.5 centimeters. Naturally, the foregoing dimensions are presented for purposes of illustration and not limitation, as a variety of orifice diameters and distances between the nozzle means and the separator means may be chosen within the scope of the present invention.Figure 6 illustrates the basic features of the exiting jet 120 as it impinges on a silicon target 128. The jet. 120 in the pre shock zone 122 includes NaCl and other chloride impurities in the gaseous state and silicon in the crystalline or liquid state. As the jet approaches target 128 it forms a shock wave 124 and passes into post shock zone 126. The silicon in post shock zone 126 is either crystalline or liquid and is carried by its forward momentum onto target 128 where it is deposited. The gaseous NaCl and other chloride impurities are carried away as a gas 130 and subsequently collected or disposed of as a by product.As discussed earlier, the separator means may be disposed apart from the collector means, as illustrated in Figure 2, or may operate in combination therewith. Likewise, the present apparatus may be constructed for operation in either the vertical or horizontal plane. An apparatus illustrating vertical operation of the present invention has been shown in Figure 2. Horizontal operation of the invention is illustrated by the apparatus 50 of Figure 7. Referring now to Figure 7, reactor nozzle 24 is disposed in the horizontal plane so that the supersonic stream of liquid silicon impinges upon a separate means comprising a tilted or vertical plate 52. As shown in Figure 8A, plate 52 may be flat, or alternatively could assume a variety of shapes, such as a V or single Chevron shape, illustrated by plate 54 in Figure 8B.Further, other shapes would include a multiple Chevron crosssectional shape 56 illustrated in Figure 8C, and a semicircular trough shape illustrated by plate 58 in Figure 8D.In the operation of the apparatus 50 in the horizontal plane, the supersonic jet of the reaction products separates, as the salt vapor tends to flow upward along the separator surface, while the liquid silicon flows downward under the force of gravity into a silicon collector means, such as collector 60 illustrated in Figure 7. The employment of an apparatus 50 disposed in the horizontal plane confers certain advantages upon the present invention, specifically 1 Sodium which inadvertently condenses in the sodium delivery line will not easily drop into the reactor causing large pressure bursts as the drops evaporate and react 2 Small amounts of silicon which collect in the reactor and become impure due to long residence times will not as readily fall or be forced into the collected silicon but can be made to collect in a sump in the reactor 12 3 The salt vapor tends to flow upward along the surface of plate 52.Thus considerably longer times can be made available for the silicon droplets to reach the separator surface than was required in the previons verti cal arrangement thereby increasing separator efficiency and, 4 Since the silicon flows downwardly as a thin liquid film while salt vapor flows upwardly away from the silicon, the silicon can be made to have an additional opportunity for volatile impurities to evaporate from it.This can be achieved by having a small sweeper flow of inert gas 62, such as argon or other inert gases pass over the silicon film below the point at which the jet strikes the separator surface. The inert gas helps to rapidly dilute and sweep away impurity vapors evaporating from the silicon film. Additional advantages can be made of this small sweeper flow if a small amount of chlorine or fluorine is added to it to halogenate and thus make volatile any of the common impurities typically found in silicon e.g. As, Al, B, P, transition elements .The present apparatus has been described with a reactor means defining a single nozzle means. As noted earlier, in the instance where the nozzle means has an orifice diameter of 0.7 centimeters, silicon flow rates of 0.5 kilogram per hour have been achieved. It has been found that optimal nozzle orifice size contributes to the efficiency of the separation of sodium products. Larger orifices have been found to be undesirable as a way of increasing the rate of production of the silicon product.Thus a further embodiment 70 of the present invention comprises the provisions of a plurality of nozzle means on a reactor means of sufficient size, so that larger, commercial scale production of the purified silicon product is possible. Referring now to Figure 9, a plurality of nozzle means 72 are provided which may impinge upon a plurality of correspondingly disposed separator means.In this way, larger quantities of purified silicon per unit time may be produced. Alternatively a greater volume of production can be achieved by using a nozzle or a plurality of nozzles having a slot like shape. The embodiment of Figure 12 which will be discussed later includes a slot like orifice having a long and a short dimension.The apparatus of the present invention can be utilized to prepare silicon in a variety of forms. Thus, the silicon may be prepared in the forms of an ingot, single crystals, a poly crystalline sheet, and the like. In order to produce silicon in ingot form with a vertically disposed apparatus 80 such as that illustrated in Figure 10 the crucible collector 14 and pedestal separator 42 of Figure 2 would be replaced by a shallow funnel shaped separator 84. The exit tube of the funnel 84 would allow silicon to flow or drop under the influence of gravity into a collector in which the silicon liquid would accumulate. The silicon would be allowed to solidify once full. Provision for removing the charged mold and inserting an empty replacement via a gate valve air lock would allow continuous operation.The efficiency of the funnel shaped separator embodiment can be increased by placing a fixed separator surface above the funnel to provide a non moving separator target.Ingot information can also be achieved by use of the apparatus illustrated in Figure 7. According to that embodiment, the downwardly flowing silicon is collected in heated mold 60. The form of the heated mold 60 dictates the exact dimensions of the ingot formed.A convenient product form for continuous Czochrolski processes is a pellet form of poly crystalline silicon.Pellets 92 can be produced by using the vertical configuration of Figure 10 with a funnel shaped separator 84 similar to the funnel shaped separator 84 previously described. An acceptable form of the separator is illustrated in Figure 10. The exit tube from the funnel 84 would preferably have a diameter of 1 mm or less so that droplets with amass of 0.5 gms or less would drop from the end of the funnel estimated from surface tension .These droplets would be allowed to solidify either by splat cooling or in a large cooled silicon collector or solidified during their fall through a shot tower. In the horizontal configuration of Figure 7 the silicon would drop from the low end of the separator plate 52..Droplet size could be minimized by placing fine quartz or graphite fibers at the end of the separator from which the silicon would drip.The use of flames of sodium and silicon tetrachloride to produce single crystal rods or boules can be done using the apparatus 100 illustrated in Figure 11. In that embodiment, a vertical configuration apparatus such as described in Figure 2 is used in which a separator itself is a growing single crystal 102 of the silicon. The single crystal 102 is withdrawn as it grows so that the separation surface onto which the silicon is deposited, in this case the top of the growing crystal, is kept a constant distance from the reactor exit orifice 24. Careful temperature control is needed to maintain the top of the silicon crystal rods at the melting point.That temperature control can be obtained by 1 careful control of the reactor wall temperature 2 addition of excess silicon tetrachloride to the reactor 3 addition of an inert gas, such as argon, to the reactor and 4 radiant heating of the rod from the electrical hea ters 16 placed around the reactor 12 and crucible 14.The process is similar in some respects to the Vernueil flame process for producing single crystals of metal oxides such as ruby. The boule sits upon a pedestal 106 which moves downwardly under the influence of threaded rod 104. A prime mover, typically a conventional motor, not shown, is used to drive rod 104. A plurality of salt condensation plates 108 help to take the salt out of the vapor phase to the liquid phase for collection.A sheet form of silicon product 112 is desirable for use in fabricating photovoltaic cells. A relatively uncomplicated technique to produce such sheets 112 from a sodium silicon tetrachloride flame is illustrated as apparatus 110 in Figure 12. According to this embodiment the separator would comprise a moving sheet 114 of a suitable substrate material e.g. mullite, graphite . A thin layer of silicon 112 would be sprayed upon the substrate sheet 114. The thickness of the silicon sheet 112 is controlled by the rate of speed at which the substrate sheet 114 passes through the jet 116, the rate of silicon production and the separation efficiency.There are many advantages to the sheet process that are not found in other prior art methods. Specifically, high rates of production are possible through the present process and contamination of the silicon is minimized by the lack of silicon reservoirs and or dies otherwise normally required. Also the rapid deposition of the silicon implies that the cooling rates of the deposited silicon can be rapid, thus preventing contamination of the silicon by the substrate material. For this process, rates of sheet formation can be expected to be in the order of meters per hour as opposed to centimeters per hour for other sheet processes.The embodiment of Figure 12 lends itself to the continous manufacture of solid state devices such as diodes, transistors and solar cells. Doping of the silicon can be continuously controlled during manufacture.The preferred embodiment of the invention comprehends introducing Na and SiCl4 into the reactor in the vaporized state. However, it is also within the scope of the invention to introduce the materials into the reactor in a mist form.The nozzles have been described or illustrated as being circular or slot like. They may also be used individually or in groups as required by the volume demands of the system. It is further likely that other geometric shapes may be satisfactory too and it should be understood that the basic teaching of the present invention is not necessarily limited to any specific shape.The preferred speed of the jet is in the supersonic range as previously described. However, it is possible that the desired effect may also be achieved with a jet just on the edge of the supersonic range i.e. in the subsonic range . The term supersonic as employed in this disclosure is therefore intended to include subsonic velocities on the edge of the supersonic range that achieve the same results.It will be appreciated that a major benefit of the pre sent invention is that the separation process is also a purification process that gets rid of impurities such as B and P as chloride salts along with the NaCl.The following part of the description are preferred embodiments 1 to 36 already drafted in the form of claims. 1.
