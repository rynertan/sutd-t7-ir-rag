# Automatic tool changer for machine tools.

## Abstract
An automatic tool changer for machine tools in which a tool changer drum 40 is rotatably mounted on a machine tool for rotation about an axis 42 which is perpendicular to the spindle axis thereof. A plurality of tool changer arms 46 are swingably mounted on the tool changer drum 40 for swinging movement along radii of the drum 40 between a storage position parallel to the plane 50 of the drum 40 and a transfer position perpendicular to the plane 50 of the drum 40 . A pneumatic cylinder 90 is used to index the tool changer drum 40 to place any selected tool changer arm 46 in the ready position 92 . Another pneumatic cylinder 96 is used to swing the ready tool changer arm 46 . Before the tool transfer operation, the spindle is moved to a tool transfer position in which the swinging movement of the tool changer arm 46 either places a toolholder in the spindle or removes a toolholder therefrom.
