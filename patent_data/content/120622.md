# Placement and retrieval of downhole gauges.

## Abstract
In the placement and retrieval of gauges employed to measure temperature, pressure and other parameters in a well bore, there is used a gauge receptacle means 10 incorporated in a pipe string 6,8 , including a substantially tubular outer housing 90 having a substantially tubular inner housing 170 substantially coaxially therein, the inner housing being supported in the outer housing by a plurality of support rings 100,132,150,160 having longitudinally extending apertures 102 therethrough. The inner housing has a landing nipple 110 profiled therein, whereby a locking mandrel 190 having a gauge holder 280 secured thereto may be run into the pipe string on a wireline, and locked into the inner housing after which the wireline may be retracted. The locking mandrel may also be subsequently unlocked and retrieved with the gauge holder by wireline.
