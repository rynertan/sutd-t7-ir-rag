# Programmable clock rate generator.

## Abstract
A clock rate generator is described which can be programmed to provide an output clock that is N M times the rate of a standard clock where N and M are integers. The generator comprises a counter 20 , a programmable mem ory 30 , reset logic 40 and a clocking control 50 . A standard clock is applied to the counter 20 so that the counter 20 is advanced by one for each clock bit. The output of the counter is connected to the input lines of the programmable memory 30 where a pattern of binary ones and zeros are stored. The output of the programmable memory 30 is applied to the clocking control 50 to combine successive bits of the same polarity. The divisor M is determined by the number of standard clock counts between successive resets of the counter 20 . The multiplier N is determined by the number of output cycles from the clocking control 50 between successive resets of the counter.
