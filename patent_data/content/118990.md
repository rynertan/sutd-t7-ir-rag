# WINE STABILIZATION USING IMMOBILIZED PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS OR TANNIC ACID

## Abstract
A process for stabilizing wine is characterized by a immobilizing tannic acid or a phenolic compound b contacting a wine having components which causes haze formation upon heating with the immobolized tannic acid or the immobilized phenolic compound for a period sufficient to remove the desired amount of haze compo nents and c separating the treated wine from the immobilized tannic acid or the immobilized phenolic compound.
