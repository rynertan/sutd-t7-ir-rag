# Process for the batch fabrication of plasma display panels.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for the batch fabrication of plasma display panels. The process uses a multiple processing technique in which a series of individual plate patterns 13 to 20 are simultaneously formed on a large master bottom plate 11 . When the master plate processing is completed and inspected, non defective individual top plates 23 25, 28 30 with associated tubulation members are provided and placed over respective non defective plate patterns on the master plate and edge sealed. The master plate is then divided into individual panels by conventional glass separation techniques such as cutting, scribing, etc. and the individual panels thus formed are completed by bakeout, backfill with an ionizable gas, and tubulation tip off. This process permits plasma display panel fabrication in a batch mode using conventional fabrication techniques, permitting multiple plasma panel fabrications in a single process cycle.
