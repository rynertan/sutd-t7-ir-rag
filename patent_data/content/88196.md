# SWITCH OPERATING DEVICE AND TABLE LAMP INCORPORATING SUCH DEVICE

## Abstract
A table lamp incorporates a switch 64 operating de vice consisting of two members 4, 30 , one member 1 being located in the base 1 of the lamp and the other in the stem 11 . The stem 11 is mounted in the base 1 for rotational movement between first and second positions representing on off positions of the lamp switch. The member 4 located in the base 1 includes a horizontal annular portion 60 from which projects two upwardly di rected triangular shaped cam surfaces 61, 62 positioned at either end of a diameter of the annulus. One end of a spring loaded plunger 65 projects through the annular portion 60 between the cam surfaces 61, 62 and the other end acts, when depressed, to close the contacts in a micro switch 64 located in the base 1 . The other member 30 located in the stem 11 , includes a surface adjacent and parallel to the annular portion from which depend two spring loaded plungers 35, 36 spaced apart to co operate with the cam surfaces 61, 62 such that rotation of the stem 11 with respect to the base 1 causes movement of the plungers 35, 36 over the cams 61, 62 from one side to the other i.e. between the first and second positions. A stop means 54, 70 is provided to restrict the degree of rotational movement. A third plunger 50 depends from the surface of the second member 30 and is positioned such that when the members are in the first position it acts to depress the plunger 65 in the first member 4 so that the switch 64 is on , and when the members are in the second position it is out of contact with said plunger so that the switch 64 is off .
