## Description
PROCESS AND COMPOSITION FOR EXTRUSION OF ZIEGLER NATTA CATALYZED OLEFIN POLYMERS This invention relates to anti gel compounds useful for reducing optical degradation phenomena in extruded polyolefin film. The compounds also are useful for preventing corrosion during high temperature processing of polyolefin film. Polyolefin resins such as polyethylene have been used for a number of years for the preparation of films by extrusion processes. Unlike high pressure, free radical polymerized polyethylenes, low pressure, low density polyethylenes prepared in the presence of Ziegler Natta catalysts commonly develop gel like defects when extruded, e.g., vhen extruded as blown films. In a blown film process, polyethylene pellets or granules are melted and extruded from an annular die to form a film envelope. In the extruder and die system, there are typically dead spots or hangup areas where molten polyethylene does not move rapidly, resulting in long heat histories for portions of the melt. As portions of the polymer are flushed from these hangup areas, they cause optical degradation phenomena in the film, known as pinstriping and gel streaking . By pinstriping is meant haze bands resulting from accumulations of micro gels which are aligned in the machine direction during the film forming process. By gel streaking is meant surface roughness in the form of the inclusion, either singularly or in rows, of v shaped gels arrovheads or chevrons , streaks of soft gels1 or, in extreme cases, film texture completely permeated by coft gels. Such optical degradation phenomena not only detract from film optical and mechanical strength properties, but also can cause severe problems vith respect to maintaining bubble geometry during the film forming process. Because of the fact that the extrusion processes usually involve the use of relatively high extrusion temperatures and prolonged extrusion times, in commercial practice, various anti oxidants, such as hindered phenolics, are admixed with the polyolefin resin, to prevent undesirable degradation of the polymer during the preparation of the film. When such anti osidants are used, however, with the film forming grades of polyolefins in certain types of extrusion equipment, the antioxidants appear to pronounce, if not create, gel streaking and pinstriping in the products thus formed. Many solutions have been proposed to eliminate gelstreaking and pinstriping. For example, it is known to physically remove the catalyst residue, prior to extrusion, by leaching the reaction product of polymer and catalyst with alcohols, aqueous acid, water, or treating the polymer and catalyst with propylene oxide followed by an alcohol or water wasE and the like. Such treatments usually produce white polymers initially, but a yellow or tan color returns when thepolymers arf subjected to molding and or heating operations. In order to avoid this undesirable color formation, it is usually necessary to use a second or even a third clean up procedure requiring the use of large quantities of deactivating materials. Another practice in the art involves drying the after treated polymer prior to fabrication.Because they usually must be repeated several times in order to obtain a polymer having acceptable color upon exposure to heat, such clean up procedures are both expensive and time consuming. Illustrative of such prior art treatments are those disclosed in U.S. patents 3,925,341 3,962,199 3,247,351 4,029,877 4,117,219 3,299,027 3,923,760 3,308,105 and 4,098,990. Other treatments disclosed in the prior art involve the addition of compounds to the polymer prior to fabrication in order to complex with the harmful components in the catalyst residue and deactivate them. Illustrative of these prior art treatments are those disclosed in Canadian patent 961,998,U.S. patent 4,013,622 and in U.S. patent 3,773,743. For example, U.S. patent 3,773,743 discloses a method for improving the stability and color of olefin polymers by deactivating their Ziegler Natta catalyst residues. This method involves high temperature 1900C 2500C processing with hydroxyl compounds E20 and primary alcohols and with an organic base such as an alkyl amine aryl amine Li, Ca and Zn salts of carboxylic acids trialkyl phosphites and metal alkoxides. The concentration disclosed for the hydroxy source is the range of 0.5 to 1.5 weight percent and a concentration of 50 to 2500 parts per million ppm is disclosed for the organic base. At the processing temperatures disclosed, some of the organic bases and the hydroxy sources would be volatile and cause foaming of the product if the processing were not done in a way to remove volatiles, e.g., as in devolatilizing esters. In high temperature processing of Ziegler Natta catalyzed polyolefin resins, such as in slot cast or blown film extrusion, it has been observed that the chloride catalyst residue present in the resins may cause corrosion of the processing equip ment. For example, corrosion pitting has been observed on both the chill roll and internal adaptor and die surfaces during slot cast film extrusion. Internal adaptor and die surfaces of blown film extrusion equipment also are subject to corrosion.Deactivation of the catalyst residue has been required in a costly separate step prior to high temperature 2100C processing of the resin. An object of the present invention is to provide a ftlm forking extrudable composition comprising a Ziegler Natta catalyzed polyolefin and an extruded film made from such extrudable composition, which film is free from gel streaking. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein Ziegler Natta catalyzed polyolefin film forming compositions may be extruded without optical degradation phenomenon appearing within the extruded film. Another object of the present invention is to provide an anti gel compound, which when added to Ziegler Natta catalyzed polyolefins is useful in removing or reacting with the chloride residue in said polyolefins to prevent gel streaking or pinstriping from occurring in subsequent extrusion processes. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for extruding tubular blown polyolefin film substantially free of Ziegler Natta chloride residues. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for producing, at high temperatures 2100t , an extruded film, sheet or molded articles made from Ziegler Natta catalyzed polyolefin resin, which process is substantially free from corrosion. This invention is based on the discovery that an optical degradation phenomenon, known as gel streaking and pinstriping, present in extruded Ziegler Natta catalyzed polyolefins, can be substantially prevented through the addition of small amounts of an organic compound of high molecular weight and relatively low volatility. The organic compound comprises a hydrogen chloride acceptor having a molecular weight greater than 180 with less than 5 by weight volatiles at 180 CC as measured by thermal evolution analysis TEA .According to the present invention, the incidence of gel streaking or pinstriping in the film during the extrusion of low pressure, low density ethylene hydrocarbon polymer resin is minimized through the use of a composition comprising a majority of a low pressure, low density ethylene hydrocarbon polymer resin and a minor amount of an anti oxidant and a hydrogen chloride acceptor as defined herein. This invention also relates to an improved method of extruding lov pressure, low density ethylene hydrocarbon polymer resins which comprise incorporating minor amounts of an anti oxidant and a hydrogen chloride acceptor into said resin prior to extrusion thereof. In one aspect, the present invention relates to an extrudable film forming composition which, when extruded, forms a film essentially devoid of gel streaking and pinstriping, the film forming extrudable composition comprising a polyolefin resin, an anti oxidant and anti gel compound. The polyolefin resin contains chloride residue from a Ziegler Natta catalyst used in its preparation. The anti oxidant is present in an amount sufficient to prevent oxidation of the film during extrusion processing and subsequent storage thereof. The anti gel compound is present in an amount sufficient to neutralize the chloride residue in the polyolefin, which amount also should be at least about 0.8 times the amount of anti oxidant present. Preferably, the amount of anti gel compound is at least equal to the amount of anti oxidant present. The amount of anti gel compound necessary to neutralize the chloride residue should be greater than about 5 times, preferably greater than about 10 times, and most preferably greater than about 20 times the amount of chloride residue present. When the ratio becomes too high, particularly at the higher chloride levels, e.g., at 200 ppm chloride residue, the anti gel compound can exude to the polymer air interface and adversely affect polyolefin surface properties such as sealing, treatability and coefficient of friction. Belov a 5 to 1 ratio, the amount of anti gel compound may not be sufficient to neutralize the chloride residue ro retard gel streaking etc. Chloride residue from a Ziegler Natta catalyst is typically present in a concentration between about 5 and about 500 ppm based upon the polyolefin. Chloride residue concentrations between about 5 and about 50 ppm are typical for polyethylene and chloride residue concentrations between about 10 and about 500 ppm are typical for nolypropylene and polybutene made vith Ziegler Natta catalysts. Anti oxidants in a concentration of 20 to 500 ppm are typically added to polyethylene resin compositions. And concentrations of 200 to 5000 ppm of anti oxidant are typically added to polypropylene or polybutene resin compositions. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for extruding a film forming polyolefin resin based composition into film. The resin based composition comprises aZiegler Natta catalyzed film grade polyolefin resin which contains n chloride residue in the range of between about 5 and about 500 ppm and anti oxidant in the range of between about 20 and about 5000 ppm based upon the polyolefin resin. The resin based Ocoposition is susceptible to gel streaking during formation of the film. This invention is based upon the discovery that such a process may be inproved by extruding the resin based comvosition into the film in the presence of an acid acceptor.The acid acceptor is typically present in a concentration between about 25 and 1O,000 ppm, based upon the weight of the polyolefin resin and has a molecular weight 180 with 5 by weight volatiles at 180 C as measured by TEA. In still another aspect, this invention relates to the discovery that high temperature above 2 0tC processing ofZiegler Natta catalyzed polyolefin resin containing a chloride catalyst residue into film can be accomplished without corrosion of the processing equipment by incorporating an acid acceptor as defined herein into the polyolefin resin composition to be processed. The concentration of acid acceptor required to prevent corrosion is between about 25 and 10,000 ppm, based upon the polyolefin resin. The acid acceptor is uniformly dispersed in the polyolefin based extrusion composition. The dispersion can be effected by various dispersion techniques commonly employed by those skilled in the art of preparing extrudable composition. The acid acceptor could be introduced into the polyolefin either by directly dry blending with a granular polyolefin e.g., polyethylene via a V type blender or by mixing via a Benschel type intensive mixer. The acid acceptor also could be hot compounded into the polyolefin to make master batch for final letdown using conventional hot processing equipment such as a Banbury mixer, a Werner Pfleiderer twin screw mixing extruder or a single screw mixer extruder that has pelletization equipment on the head of the extruder. The Acid Acceptor The acid acceptor comprises a fatty acid amine of the formula EMI8.1 wherein R is C12 24 alkyl or alkylene is hydrogen, lower alkyl, an alkanol, 1,3 propylenel dia ine or an ethoxy group of the formula C C O E, wherein x is an integer between 2 and 5 and R is R or The fatty acid amine used in this invention is normally either liquid or solid at room temperature, has a molecular weight above about 180, and has less than about 5X by eight volatiles at 1800C as measured by TEA. Below molecular weights of 180, volatility becomes a problem, resulting in bloom on the surface of the film or causes plate out or smoking on high temperature extrusion. This can adversely affect such properties as sealing, treatability and surface characteristics, in general. Increased volatility also can be manifested in foaling of the film extrudate and lensing in the blown film bubble. Too high a molecular weight simply requires more antigel compounds. Surface properties also can be affected. Suitable fatty acid amines according to the nresent invention include a saturated fatty acid amine such as lauryl amine, mystearyl amine, palmityl amine, stearyl amine, arachidyl amine, behenyl amine and the like a monounsaturated fatty acid such as oleyl amine and erucyl amine a di saturated fatty acid amine such as di lauryl amine, di mystearyl amine, dipalmityl amine, di stearyl amine, di arachidyl amine, di behenyl amine a di monounsaturated fatty acid amine such as di oleyl amine and di erucyl amine a mixed saturated and mono unsaturated fatty acid amine such as lauryl oleyl amine, lauryl stearyl amine, oleyl erucyl anine and the like lauryl, mystearyl, palmityl stearyl, arachidyl, behenyl, oleyl or erucyl methanol, ethanol propanol or butanol amines dimethanol, diethanol, dipropanol or dibutanol lauryl, mystearyl, palmityl, stearyl, arachidyl, behenyl, oleyl or erucyl amines dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl or dibutyl lauryl, mystearyl, palmityl, stearyl, arachidyl, behenyl, oleyl or erucyl amines alkoxylated lauryl, mystearyl, palmityl, stearyl, arachidyl, behenyl, oleyl or erucyl amines derived using 2 to 10 mols of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or butylene oxide and N lauryl, mystearyl, palmityl, stearyl, arachidyl, behenyl, oleyl, or erucyl 1,3 propylene diamine.

The hindered phenolic anti oxidants may be used individually or in various combinations with one another or the secondary stabilizers in the compositios of the present invention. Other additives include slip agents such as fatty acid amides, inorganic antiblocks such as finely divided silica or calcium carbonate, cling agents, fillers or colorants. Extrudable Comositions The extrudable compositions of the present invention may be used in any of the forms of such compositions which are commonly employed in the extruded film arts, such as compounds modified with various slip and anti block additives for specific end use applications. These extrudable compositions are thermoplastic in nature. In addition to the olefin polymer, anti gel compounds, anti oxidant, the compositions of the present invention may contain other adjuvant materials which are commonly employed in olefin polymer based extrudable film compositions Such other adjuvants would include plasticizers, fillers, pigments, lubricants, slip agents, modifiers and similar materials. The fillers which may be used in the olefin polymer based extrudable compositions of the present invention are the fillers which are commonly used with such polymers. The fillers are used in amounts which correspond to about 1 to 20 percent by weight, based on the weight of the olefin polymer. Such fillers vould include materials such as carbon black, titanium dioxide, clays, diatomaceous earth, calcium silicates and others known in the art. The plasticizers which may be employed in the olefin polymer based extrudable compositions of the present invention are the plasticizers which are commonly used with such polymers.The plasticizers are used in amounts which would correspond to about 1 to 25 percent by weight based on the weight of olefin polymer. Such plasticizers would include materials such as phthalates, phosphates, adipates, azelates, amine based polyols, and a number of other similar products. The lubricants which are commonly employed in the olefin polymer based extrudable compositions are the lubricants which are commonly used with such polymers. The lubricants are used in amounts.which correspond to about 0.02 to 0.2 percent by weight of lubricant agent based on the weight of the oleo in polymer. Examples of such lubricants are fatty acid amides such as stearamide, oleamide, behenamide and erucamide. Extruding Conditions The extrudable coiditions of the present invention are particularly designed for use in equipment utilized for tubular film, cast film and extrusion coating products. Such equipment may have hold up areas or areas of stagnation that retard the flov of extrudate therethrough, leads to the development of gel streaking and pinstriping in the absence of the use of the anti gel additives of the present invention. In such equipment the polyolefin based extrudable compositions are subjected to extrusion temperatures of about 275 to 650 F, and preferably about 375 t o 650 F, under varying conditions of head pressure, and for periods of time of about 0.5 to 10 minutes. The film is usually prepared in sheets which are about 0.1 to 10 mils thick. According to the present invention, the polyolefin resin compositions are not exposed to post reactor high tempera ture compounding or finishing which could introduce hydroperoxides into the composition prior to film extrusion. Instead the acid accevtor is added via a master batch or by directly dry blending it into the granular polyolefin resin prior to extrusion thereof.Another advantage of this invention is that gas treatment e.g., with propylene oxide after polymerization of the resin is not required nor are subsequent alcohol washes to remove the propylene oxide or ethylene oxide gas nor the subsequent drying process to remove the alcohol. Also unnecessary are the need for devolatilization of alcohols of water which could be added to neutralize and break down catalyst residue. Another advantage of the present invention is that the fatty acid amines may be incorporated into the polyolefin based resin composition without adversely affecting other additives normally used in such compositions such as hindered phenolic anti oxidants and phosphites, slip anti block materials such as fatty amides, silica or calcium carbonate. The fatty acid amines do not adversely interact vith these other additives nor do they cause such problems as discoloration and odor. Still another advantage of the present invention relates to high temperature extrusion of Ziegler Natta catalyzed polyolefin resin, i.e., at temperatures above about 2100C up to 300DC. The Ziegler Natta catalyst residue, primarily chlorides present in such polyolefin resins, is liberated as hydrogen chloride during such high temperature processing. The liberated hydrogen chloride can cause removal of chrome plating or corrosion of equipment, both in the adaptor and die sections, as well as on the chill rolls used in high te verature slot cast film extrusion. The hydrogen chloride also will adversely affect the metal and chrome plated surfaces in blow molding and injection molding equipment.The fatty acid amines of this invention eutralize the catalyst residues and consequently prevent adverse corrosion effects in processing equipment or on a chill roll. The solubility of the fatty acid amines in the polyolefins enables the to reach the catalyst sites to break down and neutralize the chloride residue. The following examples are illustrative of the present invention and are not intended as a limitation of the scope thereof.

Fraser et al. The properties of the ethylene 1 butene l copolymer resins were determined by the following methods Density was determined according to ASTM D 1505. A plaque was conditioned for one hour at 100 CC to approach equili 3 brium crystallinity. Density is reported as gms cm3. elt Index MI uas determined according to ASTM D 1238, Condition E. It was measured at 190 CC and 44 psi and reported as grams 10 minutes. Flow Index HLMI was measured according to ASTM D 1238, Condition F. It was measured at 10 times the weight used in the melt index test above and reported as grams per 10 minutes. Melt Flow Ratio MFR was calculated as Flow Index Nelt Index. Ti, Al and Si catalyst residues in the ethylene butene1 copolyner in ppm vas measured by induction coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. C1 catalyst residue in the ethylevne butene l copolymer in ppm was measured by a Dohrmann micro coulometric titration system. One of the ethylene butene l copolymer resins, designated A, had the folloving properties a melt index of 3 1.0 a KF2 of 28 a density of 0.918 gmtcm and a catalyst residue in ppn of Ti 2, A1 73, Si 56 and C1 13. The other ethylene butene l copolymer resin, designated B, had the following properties a melt index of 2.0 a MFR of 28 a density of 0,918 gm cm3 and a catalyst residue in ppm of Ti 3, A1 89, Si 97 and C1 16. Either resin A or resin B was used in the resin compositions of all the subsequent examples herein. Preparation of Polymer Resin Compositions One of two methods to prepare polymer resin compositions vas employed in the examples. In one method, the components vere dry blended in a roll drum for 20 minutes at room temperature with a virgin resin. In the other method, the components vere compounded into a masterbatch concentrate utilizing a Banbury batch mixer coupled to a FarrelBirmingham single screw extruder melt pump. The components vere mixed in the Banbury mixer for 4 to 5 minutes, dropped at 260 F, and extruded through an extruder melt pump using a throat temperature of 220 F, a barrel temperature of 3000F, and a die temperature of 3000F. Example 2 A series of experiments were run to demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of a fatty acid amine in polyolefin based filr extrusion compositions in order to prevent the formation of gel streaks pinstriping in tho extruded film.Table I below summarizes the results for a number of control formulations which did not contain the fatty acid amine antigel compound of this invention. The control formulations were prepared by one of the methods described hereinabove. After the formulations were prepared, films vere extruded in a tubular etrusion devce for various periods of time to assess gel fdrmation. The film was extruded at 3 lbs hr vith a 3850F melts temperature using a l inch Killion 24 to 1 length to diameter extruder equipped with a 1 1 4 inch die with a 0.30 inch gap. No nitrogen purge vas used on the extrusion hopper. The extruded films were approximately 1.5 mils thick.During extrusion, the films were examined periodically for gel streak formation and pinstriping. Table I hereinbelow sets forth the resin compositions that were employed and the results that were stained with respect to gel streak formation pinstriping. The number symbols used to designate the visual appearance of the film with respect to gel streaking pinstriping have the folloving meanings 0 clear of gel streaking pinstriping 1 slight gel streaking pinstriping 2 moderate gel streaking pinstriping 3 severe gel streakinglpinstriping A review of the information disclosed in Table I shows that the control formulations for runs 2 11 exhibited gel streaking pinstriping in the extruded films in the presence of hindered phenolic anti oxidants.

A 5 mg.sample is heated under nitrogen at 320C min up to 3000C.As the sample heats, evolved gases are swept by nitrogen to a flame ionization detector. Calibration with C20 standards permits translation of instrument output into volatile weight. Normalizing by sample weight and multiplying by 100 gives height percent volatiles. The TEA volatiles for the fatty acid amines useful in this invention are all below about 5 by weight, as shown in Table V below TABLE V Additive Volatilitv Using TEA Additive Weight Loss at 1800C 2 diethanol lauryl amine 3.112 diethanol mystearyl amine 2.30 diethanol stearyl amine 0.06 Example 5 A series of tests was run to demonstrate that the addition of the fatty acid amine to the extrudable film compositions does not adversely affect the physical properties of the extruded film to any substantial degree. Films made fromResin A based composition vere evaluated in a discoloration and coefficient of friction test and films made from Resin B based pomposition were evaluated in a roll blocking test. In the coefficient of friction test, the extrusion conditions were as follows Resin A based cpmpositions were extruded on a 2 1 2 inch diameter 24 to 1 length to diameterEgan extruder equipped with a 6 inch diameter Sano die having a 100 mil die gap. The extrusion rate was about 85 lbslhr with a melt temperature of about 3900F. The extruded films were approximately 1.5 mils thick. Table VI below sets forth the Resin A based compositions used for the coefficient of friction comparisons. The cDoefficient of friction is measured by ASTM D 1894 63. The data indicates that film made from a formulation containing a tatty acid amine did not have any significantly different coefficient of friction, as compared to a control formulation which did not contain the fatty acid amine, but was othervise the same, in terms of composition, as the other formulation.
