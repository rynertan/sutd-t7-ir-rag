# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A CROSSLINKED POLYMERIZATE FOR DENTAL PURPOSES

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for producing a cross linked polymerizate which can be employed in the dental field and with high swelling rate by copolymerization of at least one monomer with at least one crosslinking agent with at least two isolated double bonds, characterized in that for increasing the swelling rate, a surface layer of the obtained partially crosslinked polymerizate particles is subjected to a structure disaggregation by incorporating a non crosslinking monomer and subsequent polymerization thereof and or by physical action.
