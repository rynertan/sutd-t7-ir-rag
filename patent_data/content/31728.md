# Method and apparatus for electronically aligning active elements of an imaging array with an optical system.

## Abstract
An imaging apparatus includes an array 20 of light responsive elements 28 outputs from which are utilized in generating data representative of an object such as a che que 12 . The apparatus includes an optical system having a lens 32 for directing light from the cheque 12 on to a predetermined number of the linght responsive elements 28 , which number is less than the total number of elements in the array 20 . Switch means are provided for adjustably selecting a particular group of elements 28 substantially corresponding to the elements upon which light from the cheque 12 impinges. The method of selecting said particular group of ele ments involves selecting successive groups of contiguous elements 28 until the outputs of the first and last elements of such a group are found to be substantially equal.
