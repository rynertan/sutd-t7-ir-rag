# DELAYED CO INITIATION PROCESS FOR PREPARING POLYOL BLENDS

## Abstract
A delayed co initiation process for preparing polyol blends comprising a epoxidizing a first initiator compound to obtain a poly ol with a predetermined equivalent weight and b adding a second initiator which may be the same as or different from the first and epoxidizing to obtain a polyol with a predetermined equivalent weight based upon the second initiator. The resultant polyols are used in the preparation of poly urethane foams.
