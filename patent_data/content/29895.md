# Improved case construction for multi stage pump.

## Abstract
A double case, multi stage, centrifugal pump 10 having a plurality of impellers 60 mounted on a common shaft 16 at axially spaced pump stages. The first pump stage is housed within a unitary forward case section 22 of a three section inner case assembly 14 . Subsequent stages are housed within two rearward case sections 24 and 26 disposed in axial joint forming relationship with each other and radial joint forming relationship with the forward case section 22 . The inner case assembly is supported within an outer case assembly 12 which provides a suction chamber 38 sur rounding the forward case section and a discharge chamber 40 surrounding the rearward case sections 24 and 26 , the inner and outer case assemblies being constructed in such manner that the pressure in the discharge chamber sealably forces the inner case sections together during operation of the pump.
