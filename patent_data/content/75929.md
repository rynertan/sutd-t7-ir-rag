## Description
THE RECTIFlCATJON OF ETHANOLAMJNES Brief Summary of the InventionTechnical Field This invention relates to a process for the rectification of ethanolamines, in particular it is directed to the separation of ethanolamines which have essentially the same boiling point and thus are very difficult to separate directly. In particular, the invention is concerned with the effective separation of hydroxyethylpiperazine from aminoethylethanolamine.Background Art Until the development of a process for the manufacture of ethyleneamines by the amination of monoethanolamine, process streams which contain mixtures of aminoethylethanolamine and hydroxyethylpiperazine either did not exist, or if they did exist, both constituted very minor impurities in process streams. However, the development of the manufacture of ethyleneamines from monoethanolamine generated process streams which resulted in large quantities of aminoethylethanolamine containing small quantities of hydroxyethylpiperazine. Both compounds are known at pressures above 8 millimeters of mercury absolute to have boiling points which are extremely close.Indeed above 300 millimeters of mercury absolute aminoethylethanolamine has a lower boiling point and thus is the more volatile constituent. If one attempts to effect separation of the more v408tiAe aminoethylethanolamine at pressures above 300 millimeters of mercury absolute, then two problems will develop. First, the distillatro a t such pressures of such a mixture would result in boiling the more abundant aminoethylethanolamine away from the hydroxyethylpiperazine. Consequently, the desired separation would not be economically effected.The other problem is that aminoethylethanolamine degrades rapidly at temperatures above 1800C and to effect disti4bet, of aminoethylethanotamine at pressures above 300 millimeters mercury absolute, a temperature qf 1900C and above would be required. The consequence would be undesirable degradation of aminoethylethanolamine. It was also found that the boiling point of aminoethylethanolamine and hydroxyethylpiperazine are essentially the same at pressures in the range of 100 to 300 millimeters mercury absolute. This means that if one desires to separate the two by rectification it must be accomplished at some other pressure. The similariti es in polarity of hydroxyethylpiperazine and aminoethylethanolamine make their separation by extraction or other extractive distillation procedures very difficult.First of all, an appropriate extractive agent or solvent which is selective with respect to either one of the compounds has not been developed. The separation of these two compounds can be effected in the laboratory. Either one can be separated from the other by gas chromatographic spinning band columns and by other laboratory distillation techniques. However to date, the prior art has been unable to achieve commercially viable technique for the separation of these two chemicals particularly when the amount of the hydroxyethylpiperazine in admixture with the aminoethylethanolamine is about 1 20th by weight of the aminoethylethanolamine.Disclosure of Invention There is described herein a process for the effective separation of hydroxyethylpiperazine from admixture with aminoethylethanolamine which comprises feeding a composition containing a mixture of them to a distillation column containing in its interiorSulzer Packing BX to provide about 50 theoretical distillation stages therein, effecting distillation of the mixture whereby to cause the hydroxyethylpiperazine to become separated from the major amount of the aminoethylethanolamine and be recovered in the overhead from said column and thereafter recovering from said column the mixture containing the predominant amount of the aminoethylethanolamine therein, substantially free of the hydroxyethylpiperazine. One of the surprising developments of this invention yaws the determination that at a pressure below 100 millimeters mercury absolute hydroxyethylpiperazine was more volatile than aminoethylethanolamine, and that this differene in 40 mbar volatility was commercially exploitable below 30 millimeters mercury absolute. As pointed out previously, it is known that when in admixture with 400 mbar one another, at pressures greater than 300 millimeters mercury absolute, aminoethylethanolamine 133 400 is more volatile, and at pressures between 190 to 300 millimeters mercury absolute, they both had essentially the same boiling point.Once it was 133 mbar determined that at a pressure below 100 millimeters mercury absolute hydroxyethylpiperazine has the lower boiling point, it is now possible to effect efficient separation of the hydroxyethylpiperazine from the aminoethylethanolamine without at the same time distilling a substantial quantity of the aminoethylethanolamine therewith. However, the very difficult problem developed in that in order to achieve this separation on a commercial scale, it was necessary to provide in the distillation column at least 50 theoretical stages yet only exhibit a35mbar millimeter differential pressure across the length of the column.At fb miltimeters mercury absolute, hydroxyethylpiperazine has a boiling point of l220C and aminoethylethanolamine has a boiling point of 126 C. Thus the close proximity of their boiling points coupled with the low available pressure limitations in effecting the distillation, one is left with very tight constraints in effectuating the separation. Normal distillation trays have been determined as not being capable of providing the necessary limited 50 theoretical distillation stages to achieve the appropriate pressure differential in the distillation column. After considerable evaluation and examination of this problem, it was determined that essentially only one type of column internal distillation aid could be utilized in order to meet the stringent requirements set forth above.Sulzer Packing BX as an internal distillation aid in a distillation column of appropriate size has been established as a commercially valuable technique by which to achieve most effective separation of hydroxyethylpiperazine from aminoethylethanolamine. Detailed Description Sulzer Packing BX is a wire mesh packing in which the wire mesh is held on its edge in a direction essentially parallel to the flow within the column. The wire mesh is woven as a screen and is crimped appropriately with perforations punched therein at appropriate locations to allow for appropriate flow and liquid spreading therein.Sulzer Packing BX is obtainable from KochEngineering Co., Inc., 4111E, 37th Street, Wichita, Kansas, 67220. It was originally developed by the Sulrer Brothers Ltd., Switzerland. This packing has been widely employed for effecting rectification and its employment in rectification columns is well documented. The operation of the rectification column in order to separate the hydroxyethylpiperazine from the aminoethylethanolamine is practiced according to standard distillation practices and no claim in that respect is made herein as part of this invention. In practicing the distillation process of this invention, an amount of the Sulzer Packing BX is placed in the column in order to achieve the 50 theoretical stages. Another constraint in the sizing of the column and the selection of the distillation aids is the temperature that would exist at the bottom of the column should it be kept at about 30 millimeters of mercury absolute. In order to effect distiTiation of the 1hdroxyethylpiperazine with a column base at 30 lOO mil imeters of mercury absolute, the temperature at the base of the column would have to be about 1800C, depending largely on the volatility of the components in the feed other than aminoethylethanolamine and hydroxyethylpiperazine. At that temperature, as pointed out previously, aminoethylethanolamine approaches a degradation condition.Therefore, it is desirable that the pressure, upon which the temperaturte is dependent, at at at the base of the column be below 30 millimeters of mercury absolute, or not higher than 100 millimeters of mercury absolute.By operating the column below 30 millimeters of mercury absolute, there then develops a natural limitation as to what the pressure can be at the head of the column. Such natural limitations which exist are those attending the selection of equipment necessary to effect the desired vacuum and the cost, of operating such equipment. As a rule, it is more desirable to have the head ,pf the column at a pressure of at least about 3 mi limeters mercury absolute, most desirably in the area of about 5 millimeters mercury absolute. Operating under these constraints, the size of the distillation zone within the column in which the 50 theoretical stages exist would be about 40 feet in length.However, this is not to suggest that one could n1o2t utilize more of the distillation aid than the 40 feet number. More of such distillation aid as the Sulzer Packing BX can be employed but such would not provide any significant improvement in achieving the desired separation between hydroxyethylpiperazine and aminoet hylet hanol amine. Thus, in the practice of this invent ion, any reference to the amount of packing which is employed in the column is only intended for the purposes of generalizing what is employable to achieve the objectives of the invention and this invention should not be limited to any particular number limitations herein set forth. EXAMPLE l 6 in Into a rectification column having a l v çth 6 m 50 mm 4,2 m of 20 feet, a column diameter of 2 inches and 14 feet 50 theoretical distillation stages of SulzerPacking BX therein was fed an amine composition consisting of0.08 percent by weight diethylenetriamine,0.4 percent by weight aminoethylpiperazine, 1.65 percent by weight hydroxyethylpiperazine, 28.85 percent by weight aminoethylethanolamine, 55.47 percent by weight diethanolamine, 11.80percent b weight triethanolamine and 1.75 percent by weight heavies, i.e., heavies include dihydroxyethylpiperazine, dihydroxyethylethylenediamine and other higher molecular weight ethyleneamines, at a feed rate of 500 grams per hour.
