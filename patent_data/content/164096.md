# LATERAL BIDIRECTIONAL POWER FET WITH NOTCHED MULTI CHANNEL STACKING

## Abstract
A lateral bidirectional power FET 2 has a common drift region 6 between first and second stacks 8, 10 of alternating conductivity type layers 12 17 and 18 23 . A notch 38 extends vertically downwardly into the drift region and laterally separates the stacks above the drift region. The stacks include a plurality of channel containing regions 12 14 and 18 20 interleaved with a plurality of source regions 15 17 and 21 13 . In the ON state, bidirectional current flows serially through the source regions and channels of each stack and through the drift region. In the OFF state, voltage is dropped across the plurality of junctions in series in the stacks, and the respective junctions with the drift region.
