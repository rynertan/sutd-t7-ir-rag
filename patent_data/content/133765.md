# Making rings from tube or bar stock.

## Abstract
Rings are made from tube stock 10 or bar stock by cold rolling successive end portions 78 of the latter between profile rolling elements 42, 44 of a plurality of rollers which also include parting tool elements 40 for making a parting groove, also by cold rolling. The parting groove is formed, by the parting tool elements whilst the profile rolling operation takes place during the latter part of the parting groove forming operation. With bar stock, a bore is made through the end portion of the stock, e.g. after the parting groove is formed, the latter having a depth just insufficient for final parting off, which takes place during subsequent machining of the bore of the ring. A locating groove 76, 80 is also formed, by means of a grooving tool 74 , simultaneously with the rolling operation.
