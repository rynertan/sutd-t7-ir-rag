# Semiconductor laser devices.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser device comprises a first pho todetector 5 formed on one major surface of a semiconductor substrate 1 , a semiconductor laser chip 3 mounted on the major surface adjacent to the first photodetector 5 , and a sec ond photodetector 8 formed on the major surface adjacent to the first photodetector 5 and on the side thereof opposite to the semiconductor laser chip 3 .
