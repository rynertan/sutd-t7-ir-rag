# Procaryotic carbonyl hydrolases, methods, DNA, vectors and transformed hosts for producing them, and detergent compositions containing them.

## Abstract
Methods and vectors are provided for the production of procaryotic carbonyl hydrolases in recombinant systems. DNA which encodes such hydrolases are mutated at predetermined regions by known methods or by a novel point mutagenesis method in order to generate mutant hydrolases. Particular point mutations in carbonyl hydrolases such as subtilisin result in modifications of oxidation stability, Km, Kcat, Kcat Km ratio substrate specificity, specific activity or pH activity profiles. These mutated hydrolases are particularly useful in laundry compositions. Mutations in the genes encoding the subtilisin or neutral protease of bacillus yield substantially normally sporu lating bacillus strains which are incapable of excreting subtil isin or neutral protease. Such strains are useful in the recombi nant synthesis of heterologous proteins.
