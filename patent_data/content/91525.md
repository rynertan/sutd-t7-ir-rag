## Description
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to new phosphonoalkanoylamino acids of the general formula I EMI1.1 in which R1 and R2, which are the same or different, are each selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted lower alkyl, a lower alkenyl, an optionally substituted aryl and an optionally substituted aralkyl radical n is O or 1 R3 is a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted lower alkyl, a lower alkenyl, an optionally substituted aryl or an optionally substituted aralkyl group and a R4 is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl or a phenyllower alkyl radical R5 and R6, which are the same or different, are each selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted lower alkyl or an aryl radical and R7 is selected from the group consisting of OR8, NRg or SR1o, wherein R8 and R10 are each selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl, an optionally substituted aryl, or an optionally substituted aralkyl radical and R9 is a hydrogen atom, a hydroxy or lower alkyl radical or the residue of an amino acid or b R4 and R5 are part of a four , five or sixmembered optionally substituted heterocyclic ring as a connected bridge of 2 to 4 atoms of carbon or carbon and either nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen and R6 and R7 are each as defined in a with the proviso that when R3 is a hydrogen atom, n is 0, the heterocyclic ring is an unsubstituted pyrrolidine, R6 is a hydrogen atom, and R7 is OR8, at least one of R1, R2 and R8 is an optionally substituted aryl radical or c R5 and R6 are selected to form a side chain of an d amino acid, where N R4 CR5R6COR7 is an t amino acid residue, for example one classified as essential with respect to its growth effect on rates, with the proviso that i whenR3 is hydrogen and n is 0, the amino acid residue is not alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine or phenylala nine, and ii when R3 is hydrogen and n is 1, the K amino acid residue is not aspartic acid or d R5 and R6 are part of a cycloalkyl ring of from 3 to 6 carbon atoms as, for example, when the N R4 CR5R6COR7 moiety of c is the l aminocyclopentanecarboxylate residue and R4 and R7, where appropriate, are each as defined in a and to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the formula I . As used herein, the expression lower alkyl includes straight chain, branched chain and cycloalkyl grqups having up to seven carbon atoms for example, dimethyl, ethyl propyl, isopropyl, butyl, Sec. butyl, tert. butyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. In the straight and branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbons the C1 to C4 members, and especially the C1 to C2 members are preferred. Cyclopentyl or, cyclohexyl radicals are the preferred cycloalkyl groups. The salts include the metal salts, preferably the alkali and alkaline earth metal salts, and especially the sodium, potassium, lithium and calcium salts. Other salts that may be mentioned are the ammonium and quarternary ammonium salts. When R4 ad R5 form part of a connected bridge, ic R6 is a hydrogen atom, the heterocyclic ring can contain unsaturation as exemplified by moieties such asEMI3.1 and or can be substituted at any of the carbon atoms in the bridge as exemplified by moieties such asEMI3.2 wherein X is CH2, O, S or NH and R11 and R12, which are the same or different, are each selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a hydroxy, lower alkyl, a cycloalkyl, an optionally substituted aryl, an optionally substituted aralkyl an alkyoxy, an aryloxy or a sulphenyl radical. When a sulphur atom is present in the heterocyclic ring or substituents it can be in the oxidation state of 2, 4 or 6 as a sulphide, sulphoxide or sulphone. When R4 and R5 are bridged, a five membered heterocyclic ring is preferred, for example thiazolidine or pyrrolidine and especially thiazolidine. When n is 1 and N R4 CR5R6COR7 is the residue of qz a amino acid, arginine, phenylalanine, leucine, methionine and lysine are preferred. It is to be understood that this invention encompasses the isomeric forms of the compounds as vell as racemic mixtures thereof. The pure isomeric forms can be synthesized from the corresponding optically active constituents or the racemic mixtures separated by techniques well known in the art. The compounds of this invention are antihypertensive agents and are particularly useful for the reduction of angiotensin related hypertension. Present indications are that they are also likely to be useful as antibacterial, anticancer and antiviral agents. Angiotensin converting enzyme is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the C terminal l histidyl l leucine residue of angiotensin I to produce the octapeptide angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor.Inhibitors of angiotensin converting eniyme can reduce or alleviate hypertension. Based on the similarity of this enzyme to the zinc dependent carboxypeptidase A, a series of angiotens in converting enzyme inhibitors containing a mercaptoalkanoyl moiety were developed D.W. Cushman, H.S. Cheung, E.F.Sabo and M.A. Ondetti, Biochem., 16, 5484 1977 . In compounds of this type the sulphydryl group chelates with the zinc atom at the active site of the metalloenzyme. Phosphoryl groups are also known to provide a strong zinc binding function in the inhibition of metalloenzymes C. Kam, N.Nishino and J.C. Powers, Biochem., 18, 3032 1979 . SeveralN phosphoryl dipeptides R.E.Galardy, Biochem. Biophys. Res.Chom., 97, 94 1980 E.D. Thorsett, A.A. Patchett, E.E.Harris and A.L. Maycock, European Patent No. , phosphonoacyl prolines M.A. Ondetti and E.W.Petrillo, U.S. Patent No. 4,151,172 Apr. 24 1979 and phosphinylacyl prolines E.W. Petrollo, U.S. Patent No. are known to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme. The preferred compounds of formula I , which are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, are those wherein n is 1 at least one of R, and R2 is a hydrogen atom R3 is a methyl group R4 and R5 form part of a pyrrolidine or thiazolidine ring and especially thiazolidine R6 is a hydrogen atom and R7 forms part of a carboxylic acid or ester OR8 .The phosphonoalkanoyl amino acids of this invention are superior to the mercaptoalkanoyl amino acid inhibitors, because they lack the toxicity associated with the presence of the sulphydryl group Lancet, 1980, 129 Compounds of the formula I , which contain a phosphorus carbon bond, are more stable than the N phosphorylated dipeptides and related compounds of the formulaEMI5.1 where X is NH, O or S, which are susceptible to hydrolysis see T.C. Bruice and S.J. Benkovic Bioorganic Mechanisms Vol II, W.A. Benjamin, New York, 1966, Chapter 5 . Of the known phosphonoacyl prolines, l phosphonoacetyl l proline was the most potent inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme. Either lengthening or substituting the acyl side chain diminished the activity E.W. Petrillo, M.A. Ondetti, D.W. Cushman, E.R.Weaver and J E. Heikes, Abst 176th Meeting Amer.Chem. Soc., Sept 1978, MEDI 27 . Thus U.S. Patent No. 4,151, 172, Apr. 24, 1979 claims that n equals 0 is preferred for compounds of the general formula I, where R4 and R5 forms a pyrrolidine ring. However, phosphonoacyl prolines and the new compounds described herein are even more effective antihypertensives when the acyl side chain is both lengthened as well as substituted i.e. compounds of formula I where n is 1 andR3 is methyl are preferred. Incorporation of a thiazolidine ring into these agents also represents an advantage over the proline series by increasing the lipid solubility of the compound and increasing penetration across the blood brain barrier. When n is 1, the compounds of this invention can be prepared by I reacting a trialkyl or triallylphosphite of the formulaEMI6.1 with a 2 substituted acrylic acid of the formulaEMI6.2 to form a triester of the formulaEMI6.3 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are each as defined in claim 1 and R is a lower alkyl, aryl, or aralkyl radical II hydrolysing the thus formed triester with a base to form a diester of the formulaEMI6.4 and III reacting the thus formed diester with a compound of the formulaEMI6.5 in the presence of a condensing agent, thereby to form a compound according to claim 1. The 2 substituted acrylic acid may be,for example, methacrylic acid, and the condensing agent dicyclohexyl carbodiimide. The trialkylphosphites can be prepared by standard techniques see Vogels Textbook of Practical OrganicChemistry , Fourth Edition, Longmans, 1978, page 405, andT.R.Herrin, J.S. Fairgrieve, R.R.Bower, N.L. Shiplowitz, andJ.C.H. Mao, J.Med. Chem., 20, 660 1977 . Compounds of the formula IV, where R7 does not contain a hydroxyl, hydroxyamino or sulphydryl radical, are preferred. Especially preferred are compounds where R7 forms a lower alkyl or aralkyl ester such as methyl, ethyl, t butyl or phenylmethyl, which can be easily removed by base or acid catalyzed hydrolysis, or by catalytic hydrogenation as exemplified in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry Ed. J.F.W.McOmie, Plenum Press London, 1973 and the references therein. Compounds of the formula III can also be activated, for example by formation of the acid chloride. Subsequent acylation of compounds of the formula IV with this activated acid then yields compounds of the formula I . When n is 1, compounds of the formula I can also be prepared by carrying out the condensation of the trialkylphosphite and 2 substituted acrylic acid in the presence of an amine of the general formula IV where R7 is preferably an alkoxy oramino group. This procedure avoids the intet mediate hydrolysis and acylation reactions of the two step process. Compounds of the formula IV where R7 is OR8, can be prepared from the corresponding amino acids by the standard techniques of esterification, as exemplified by G.Jolles, G.Poiget, J.Robert, B.Terlain and J.P. Thomas, Bull. Soc. Chem.France, 1965, 2252 R.E.Neuman and E.L. Smith, J.Biol. Chem., 193, 97 1951 D.J. Hanahan and R Vercamer, J.Amer. Chem.Soc., 76, 1906 1954 and S Ratner and H.T.Clarke, J. Amer.Chem. Soc., 59, 200 1937 . When R7 in formula IV is NHR9 or SR10 the compounds can be prepared by reaction of the corresponding amine or sulphydryl compound with lower alkyl esters, acylhalides or anhydrides of the amino acid, as exemplified by R.W.Chambers and F.H. Carpenter, J.Amer. Chem. Soc., 77, 1522 1955 and D.P.N. Satchell, Quart. Rev., 17, 182 1963 or by reacting amino acids in the presence of a coupling reagent like dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. During this process other reactive centres in the amino acid may be protected, with easily removable groups, by the standard techniques utilized in peptide chemistry. Compounds of the Formula IV, where R4 and R5 form part of a heterocyclic ring which is substituted or contains an alkene group can be prepared by a variety of procedures including the condensation of cysteine with aldehydes or ketones as exemplified by B.Paul and W. Korytnyk, 3. Med. Chem., 19, 1002 1976 and V.M. Kulkarni and H.P.Tipnis, Curr. Sci., 41, 637 1972 reduction of pyrrole carboxylic acids or alkylation, halogenation, oxidation or dehydration of hydroxy prolines, for example see S.S. Kerwar,A.M. Felix, R.J. Marcel, I. Tsai and R.A. Salvador, J. Biol.Chem., 251, 503 1976 and R.H. Andreatta, V.Nair, A.V.Robertson and W.R.J. Simpson, Aust. J. Chem., 20, 1494 1967 and other standard processes well known in the art. When a sulphide group is present in compounds of the formula I or IV , for example as a thiazolidine ring, it can be converted to the corresponding sulphoxide or sulphone by oxidation using standard techniques as exemplified by Organic FunctionalGroup Preparations S.R. Sandler and W.Karo, Academic Press,London, 1968, Vol. 1, Chapters 19 and 20. When n is zero, the compounds of this invention can be prepared by substituting intermediates of the formula V wherein R is lower alkyl, aryl or aralkyl for compounds of the formula II EMI8.1 Compounds of the formula V can be prepared by the standardMichaelis Arbuzov reactions of a trialkyl or triallylphosphite and an haloester as illustrated by L. Maier and M.M.Crutchfield, Phosphorous and Sulfur, 5, 45 1978 and the references therein. The alkoxyphosphinyl groups in compounds of the general formula I can be selectively converted to the corresponding phosphoric acids by hydrolysis in acid, catalytic hydrogenation or by treatment with trimethyl halosilanes, e.g.as illustrated by T.R. Herrin, J.S. Fairgrieve, R.R.Bower,N.L. Shipkowitz and J.C.H. Mao, J. Med. Chem., 20, 660 1977 C.E. McKenna and J. Schmidhauser, J.C.S. Chem. Comm., 1979, 739 and the references therein. The compounds of the general formula I, wherein R7 is an ester group, can also be prepared by esterification of the corresponding carboxylic acids, using standard techniques.Esterification of this carboxylic acid can also be carried out with simultaneous acid hydrolysis of the alkoxyphosphinyl groups. Similarly when R7 in formula I is part of a carboxylic acid or ester group, it can be converted to an amide, hydroxamic acid or thioester by standard procedures. For antihypertensiveftactivity a single dose, or preferably two to four divided daily doses, provided on a basis of 0.5 to 500 mg. per kilogram per day, is appropriate to bring about a reduction in elevated blood pressure. The animal model experiments described by Patchett et al., Nature, 288, 280283, 1980 provide a valuable guide. The composition is preferably administered subcutaneously, intramusculary, intravenously or intraperitoneally, but it can also be administered orally with a dose of 1 to 500 mg per kilogram per day, preferably about 10 to 100 mg per kilogram per day. The compound or compounds of formula I can be formulated as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration. Sterile solutions or suspensions can be used for parenteral use. About 1.0 to 500 mg of a compound or compounds of formula I can be compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavour, etc., in a conventional unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active substance is selected so as to provide a dosage in the range indicated.
