# Disengaging apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus includes a pivoted hook 12 having its pivot point 16 and its engaging point 20 substantially vertically aligned, the hook being positioned between a pair of plates 14 and having an integral counterweight 28 extending laterally from the engaging point 20 . A first link 54 is pivotally attached at one end to the lateral extension 28 and at the other end is pivotally attached to the first end of a second link 58 which is mounted for rotation about a fixed point 62 . Under load the links are in a first extended position but under light or no load condi tion the hook 12 and link 58 can each rotate about their respective pivots 16 and 62 to cause a constant radius engaging surface of the hook to rotate about its axis at point 16 thereby disengaging the hook from a ring or the like to which it is attached. Additionally, a stop and locking member may be provided to prevent accidental release of the hook.
