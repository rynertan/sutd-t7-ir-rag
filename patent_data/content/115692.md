# Improvements in or relating to wall fixings.

## Abstract
A fixing device is disclosed for use on hard surfaces such as exterior walls, wood, glass or metal for supporting elements, particularly elongate elements, against such sur faces. The fixing device comprises in combination a holding member, for example a plastics plant tie 35, 36 cable grip or pipe clasp, and a portion of an adhesive composition of putty consistency 41 . The holding member has a cup por tion 34 which defines a socket 32 . The composition is a filled hardenable adhesive composition including an ad hesive component such as epoxide resin and a hardener component such as a mercaptan amine accelerated poly amide hardener which are separately present in the com position in pre determined proportions such that the com position is workable by hand to mix the components and activate a hardening reaction. In use, a portion of the com position may be separated from a ribbon and mixed be tween the fingers to form a pellet 41 which is pressed into the socket 32 of the holding member to fill the socket, the device then being pressed onto a hard surface 42 and time allowed for the composition to become rock hard and bond to the surface.
