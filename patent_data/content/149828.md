## Description
The invention relates to a novel impact resistant ethylene propylene block copolymer C , comprising a homopolymeric propylene part consisting of at least 98 wt of propylene groups, and a copolymeric ethylene propylene part, the weight ratio between the homopolymeric propylene part and the copolymeric ethylene propylene part being from 3 2 up to a ratio of less than 4 1, preferably from 7 3 up to a ratio of less than 4 1, which contains a total amount of 14 20 wt ethylene groups characterized in that its Izod value measured according to ISO R 180 at 296 K is at least 30 kJ m², preferably at least 40 kJ m² and in particular at least 50 kJ m², for instance 50 100 kJ m², in that its E modulus measured according to ASTM D790 at 296 K is at least 900 N mm², preferably at least 1000 N mm², and in particular at least 1100 N mm², for instance 1100 1300 N mm², and in that its melt index measured according to ASTM D 1238 at 503 K and 21.6 N is 4 20 dg min, preferably 4 12 dg min, particularly 4 9 dg min. The ethylene content is determined by means of IR analysis of the polymer in melted condition. The Izod value is determined on an injection moulded test sheet and the E modulus on a compression moulded test sheet with a thickness of 1.6 mm. The homopolymeric propylene part is understood to mean a part of the block copolymer consisting of at least 98 wt of propylene groups. The copolymeric ethylene propylene part is understood to mean a part of the block copolymer consisting of at least 90 wt substantially randomly distributed ethylene groups and propylene groups. This very special combination of a high impact resistance, as well as a high rigidity, along with good flow properties has so far been unknown for ethylene propylene block copolymers. Block copolymers similar to those of the invention are known from EP A 94818 and EP A 77532 but these prior art copolymers do not meet the impact properties in combination with the stiffness of the block copolymers of the present invention. The impact resistant ethylene propylene block copolymer according to the invention preferably contains per 10⁶ parts by weight block copolymer at least 50 parts by weight of one or more compounds of zinc and or cadmium, calculated as zinc and or cadmium atoms. Preference is given to the presence of zinc compounds. Very suitable zinc compounds in this connection are zinc stearate and zinc hexanoate. The invention also comprises a process for preparing a impact resistant ethylene propylene block copolymer C , characterized The kneading treatment can be effected in various ways. It implies the exertion of mechanical forces on the starting ethylene propylene block copolymer e.g. by means of a kneading and or transport screw of e.g. extruding or injection moulding equipment or by means of a rolling device. Preference is given to single screw or multi screw kneading, which kneading operation can be repeated more than once, and in which one or more of the kneading operations can be followed by extrusion. The duration of the kneading treatment is at least 1 4 minute, particularly at least 1 minute. If the kneading treatment consists of more than one kneading operation, there may be a longer period of time between two kneading operations. Thus in first kneading operation a pre product for instance a granulate can be prepared, subsequently be transported to another place and finally be processed in a second kneading operation according to the invention to form an end product according to the invention. The presence of free radicals in the process according to the invention can be realized in any suitable manner. A suitable manner consists in the addition, before and or during the said kneading treatment, of a total amount of 10 20000 parts by weight of one or more peroxides per 10⁶ parts by weight starting ethylene propylene block copolymer to the substance or substances subjected or to be subjected to the kneading treatment. Preference is given to using peroxides having at the average temperature of a kneading operation a half time value less than 1 5 of the duration of the relative kneading treatment. Suitable peroxides are di t butylperoxyisopropyl benzene, 1,1 di t butylperoxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane, 1,1 di t butylperoxycyclohexane, t butylperoxyisopropylcarbonate, t butylperoxybenzoate, di cumylperoxide, di t butylperoxide, 2,2 di t butylperoxybutane, di benzoylperoxide, 2,5 di methylhexane 2,5 di t butylperoxide and 2,5 di methylhexyn 2,5 di t butylperoxide. Another suitable manner for realizing the presence of free radicals is the high energy irradiation, for instance electron radiation or gamma radiation, of the starting ethylene propylene block copolymer subjected or to be subjected to the kneading treatment, preferably in the almost complete absence of stabilizers, at a dose of 0.1 4 Mrad. All kinds of combinations of the use of peroxides and of the said irradiation are suitable as well. The kneading treatment according to the invention is preferably effected in whole or in part in the presence of at least 50 parts by weight of one or more zinc and or cadmium compounds, calculated as zinc and or cadmium atoms, per 10⁶ parts by weight starting ethylene propylene block copolymer. Other additives, too, may be present or be added during this kneading tratment, for instance heat stabilizers, UV stabilizers and nucleation agents. Very suitable fillers for ethylene propylene block copolymers according to the invention are chalk, with by preference an average particle size of below 2 µm, and talcum, with by preference an average particle size of below 5 µm. Suitable are quantities of filler of below 25 wt . A higher weight percentage filler quickly leads to very bad mechanical properties of the copolymer filler mixture compared with the pure copolymers. The impact resistant ethylene propylene block copolymers according to the invention are very suitable for use in car bumpers, front ends, spoilers, liners, motor car underside coats and wheel arch lining for motor cars. The invention is further elucidated by means of the following examples and the comparative experiment. A homopolymeric propylene prepolymer having a melt index measured according to ASTM D 1238 at 503 K and 21.6 N of 11.9 dg min is produced. Subsequently ethylene and propylene are polymerized in the presence of this propylene prepolymer to form a powdery starting ethylene propylene block copolymer with a weight ratio between the homopolymeric propylene part and the copolymeric ethylene propylene part of 27 10, with a total content of ethylene groups of 15 wt and with a melt index measured according to ASTM D 1238 at 503 K and 21.6 N of 0.85 dg min. This starting ethylene propylene block copolymer is then provided with 0.05 wt zinc stearate, 0.05 wt calcium stearate, 0.1 Irganox B 225 a trade name and trade product of Ciba Geigy and 0.024 wt di t butylperoxyisopropyl benzene calculated in respect of the final mixture. The starting ethylene propylene block copolymer provided with these additives is subsequently kneaded in a single screw kneader at 523 K for 1.5 minutes and then extruded to form granulate. This granulate has A homopolymeric propylene prepolymer with a melt index measured according to ASTM D 1238 at 503 K and 21.6 N of 64.6 dg min is produced. Subsequently ethylene and propylene are polymerized in the presence of this propylene prepolymer to form a starting ethylene propylene block copolymer with a weight ratio between the homopolymeric propylene part and the copolymeric ethylene propylene part of 27 10, with a total content of ethylene groups of 15 wt and with a melt index measured according to ASTM D 1238 at 503 K and 21.6 N of 5.2 dg min. This starting ethylene propylene block copolymer is subsequently provided with 0.05 wt zinc stearate, 0.05 wt calcium stearate, 0.1 wt Irganox B 225 a trade name and trade product of Ciba Geigy calculated in respect of the final mixture. The starting ethylene propylene block copolymer provided with these additives now without peroxide is subsequently kneaded in a single screw at 523 K for 1.5 minutes and then extruded to form granulate. This granulate has
