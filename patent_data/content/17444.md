# Electrode drive and nozzle system for automatic air carbon arc cutting and gouging torch.

## Abstract
An automatic air carbon arc cutting and gouging torch having drive means for the elongated electrode consisting of opposed wheels 30, 56 biased toward the electrode for frictional contact to drive the electrode by driving one of the wheels. Each wheel can be adjusted about a pivot 44,58 point to compensate for curvature o the electrode, changes in diameter, or mis aligned joints in successive electrodes. The torch includes an improved nozzle 70 to conduct both current and process air to the electrode thus lowering the operating temperature of the torch.
