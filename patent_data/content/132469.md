With reference to Figure 1, the rotary motor of the present invention, generally designated by reference numeral 10, comprises a rotor 12 supported in an internal chamber 14 formed in a housing 16. An energy input assembly not shown in Figure 1 is provided to cause orbital movement of the rotor 12 within the internal chamber 14, thereby causing the centroid of the rotor 12 to follow an oval shaped path. An orbital coupling assembly 18 is provided to cause rotational movement of an output shaft 20, in response to orbital movement of the rotor 12. The internal chamber 14 is defined by a flat front wall 22 and a parallel back wall 24, between which extends a peripheral wall 26.Disposed within the internal chamber 14, and supported by the housing 16, is the rotor 12. The rotor 12 has parallel first and second face surfaces 28 and 30 which clearingly engage, respectively, the front wall 22 and back wall 24 of the housing 16. These face surfaces 28 and 30 are interrupted by a central aperture 32, leading to an interior cavity 34. Suppcrted by the rotor 12 within the interior cavity 34 is the orbital coupling assembly 18. As best shown in Figures 6 through 12, the rotor 12 has first, second and third lobes 36, 38 and 40. The end of the lobes are apices of an equilateral triangle having a circumscribed circle not shown of radius R. The centroid of this equilateral triangle is hereinafter referred to as the rotor centroid 42, and is disposed at a distanceR from the end of each lobe. Extending through the rotor centroid 42 and perpendicular to the first and second face surfaces 28 and 30, is a first rotational axis 44, as shown in Figure 1. Extending between its first and second face surfaces 28 and 30 the rotor 12 has a first side surface 46 between Ehe first and second lobes 36 and 38. It has also a second side surface 48 between the second and third lobes 38 and 40 and a third side surface 49 shown in Figures 6 through 12 between the third and first lobes 40 and 36. These side surfaces are shown as arcuate and convex in cross section. In an alternative embodiment, shown inFigure 15, the side surfaces are configured as follows. Adjacent the first lobe 36, the first side surface consists of a convex section 120 which extends in a counterclockwise direction toward the second lobe 38. Adjacent the second lobe 38 the first side surface consists of a concave section 122 shorter than the convex section 120 and having a smaller radius of curvature than the convex section 120. The profile of the first side surface 46 is invariant in profile between the first and second sue surfaces 28 and 30. The second and third side surfaces 48 and 49 extend respectively from the second lobe 38 to the third lobe 40 and from the third lobe 40 to the first lobe 36 in like manner. The interior cavity of the rotor 12 is of fixed, circular cross section and is defined by an internal rotor wall 54 axially symmetric about the first rotational axis 44. Extending into the interior cavity 12 from the second face surface is an annular flange section 56, shown in Figure 1.The flange section 56 is characterized by a converter engagement surface 57. The orbital coupling assembly 18 is disposed within the internal cavity 34 of the rotor 12, and comprises a circular converter member 58 and a rotary converter member 60. The circular converter member 58 is cylindrical, centered on a third rotational axis 62 which is parallel to the first rotational axis 44, and is spaced therefrom by a selected distance B. The circular converter member 58 is characterized by a flange engaging section 64, best shown in the cross sectional view of Figure 4 , and an integral central section 66 best shown in the crosssectional view of Figure 3 . It has a non integral gear section 68 best shown in Figure 2 which is engaged with the central section 66 in a manner to be described hereafter. With reference to Figure 4, the flangeengaging section 64 of the circular converter member 58 has a circular eccentric aperture 70 centered on the first rotational axis 44 and therefore offset from the center of symmetry of the flange engaging section 64 by a distance B. The eccentric aperture 70 is so sized that the flange engaging section 64 is in peripheral contact with the converter engagement surface 57 of the flange section 56 of the rotor 12.A bearing 72 is disposed at the area of this contact, so as to maintain the two sections in sliding contact. Turning to Figure 1, the central section 66 of the circular converter member 58 has a central section cavity 74, with its axis on the third rotational axis 62, and having a converter engagement surface 75. The e rotary converter member 60 is received within this central section cavity 74, in a manner to be described. Turning now to Figure 2, the gear section 68 of the circular converter member 58 is an annularshaped member having a circular, internal gear track 76 and a coaxial circular external gear track 78.Both gear tracks 76 and 78 are centered on the third rotational axis 62. The gear section 68 nonintegrally contacts the central section 66 so that the respective sections are independently rotatable about the third rotational axis 62. As best shown in Figures 1 and 2, the external gear track 78 of the gear section 68 is tangentially engaged with a circular rotor gear track 80 which extends around the periphery of the internal rotor wall 54. The internal gear track 76 is engaged with the rotary converter member 60. The rotary converter member 60 comprises an eccentric section 82 and a concentric section 84.The eccentric section 82, best shown in Figure 3, is cylindrical and centered on the third rotational axis 62. The eccentric section 82 is received within the central section cavity 74 of the circular converter member 58 the converter engagement surface 75 of the central section 66 of the circular converter member 58 is maintained in sliding engagement with the eccentric section 82 by means of a bearing 86, shown in Figure 3. As best shown in Figures 1 and 2, the concentric section 84 of the rotary converter member 60 is integral with the eccentric section 82 and comprises a cylindrical member symmetrical about a second rotational axis 88. The second rotational axis is parallel to the first and second rotational axes 44 and 62 and is spaced from the third rotational axis 62 by a selected distance A. The concentric section 84 comprises circular external gear track 90, coaxial with the second rotational axis and tangentially engaged with the internal gear track 76 of the circular converter member 68. The applicable gear ratios for these gear tracks will be described later. As best shown in Figures 1 and 4, the output shaft 20 is integral and coaxial with the concentric section 84 of the rotary converter member 60. The output shaft 20 comprises a first section 92 and a second section 94. The first section 92 extends with play through an aperture in the front wall 22 and the second section 94 extends with play through an aperture in the back wall 24 of the housing 16. Bearings not shown are provided in each aperture in order to slidingly support the sections of the output shaft 20. Because the position of the output shaft 20 is fixed by the housing 16, and because the rotary converter member 60 is integral with the output shaft 20, the eccentric section 82 of the rotary converter member 20 is free only to rotate about the second rotational axis 88, which is the rotational axis of the output shaft 20. Because the eccentric section 82 is received symmetrically within the circular converter member 58, at the central section cavity 74 thereof, this constraint on the motion of the eccentric section 82 likewise constrains the circular converter member 58 to rotate in a circular orbit about the second rotational axis 88. The practical consequences of thin constraint will be discussed hereafter. In order to describe the contour of the internal chamber 14 of the housing 16, a brief synopsis of the operation of the rotary motor 10 is necessary. As shown in Figures 6 through 12, , it ii conteuplated that the rotor 12 wall move about the internal chamber 14 in such a way that all three lobes 36, 28 and 40 remain continuously in contact with the walls defining the internal chamber 14. During operation of the rotary motor 10, the rotor 12 will rotate about its own rotor centroid 42 and will also follow an oval sllaved orbit about the internal chamber, with the rotor centroid 42 following the path shown in Figures 6 through 12. In order to convert this motion into useful work, it is contemplated that the motion of the rotor 12 will be converted into circular orbital movement of the circular converter member 58 about the second rotational axis 88, and rotation of the circular orbital converter 58 about the third rotational axis 62. This movement will then be used to drive rotation of the output shaft 20 by way of the rotary converter member 60. Referring to Figure 1, it will be recalled that the circular converter member 58 is constrained to move in a circular orbit about the second rotational axis 88, as discussed above. Given the necessary circular orbital movement of the circular converter member 58, the path followed by the rotor 12, which is engaged with the circular converter member 58, may be determined. The necessary path of the rotor 12 will in turn determine the shape of the internal chamber 14. Figures 5 and 13 show the configuration of the rotary motor 10 after the rotor centroid 42 has travelled through an arbitrary angle a from the position shown in Figure 4.The angle a is measured with respect to any arbitrary xaxis with the z axis taken as the second rotational axis 88. Rcferrin to Figure 13, it will be noted that the bearing surface 72 is characterized by the property that the rotor centroid 42 moves through an angle a about the third rotational axis 62 in response to movement of the circular converter member 58 through an angle a about the first rotational axis. Given this, if the second rotational axis is regarded as th z axis, these geometrical relationships require that the rotor centroid 42 follow the path x A B cos a y A B sin a In order to determine the shape of the internal chamber 14 the rate of rotation of the rotor 12 about its own axis, relative to its rate of orbital rotation, must be selected. Additionally, the initial position of the lobes of the rotor 12 must be chosen. For purposes of the preferred embodiment the third lobe 40 will be assumed to be disposed along the x axis wheii a O it should be uncicrstood, however, that other initial conditions could be selected. For purposes of the preferred embodiment, the rotor 12 will be caused to rotate about its rotor centroid 42 at 1 3 of the rate at which the third rotational axis 62 orbits about the internal chamber 14. Because the rotor 12 has three identical side surfaces, this constraint means that each complete orbital rotation of the rotor centroid 42 brings a new side surface into the same position occupied by the adjacent side surface one orbit before. By examining the geometry shown in Figure 14 it will be appreciated that the constraints discussed above are such that the line connecting the rotor centroid 42 to the extremity of the third lobe 40 will travel through an angle a 3 when the third rotational axis 62 travels through an angle a about the second rotational axis 88. In three orbital revolutions of the rotor centroid 42 about the axis 88, the third lobe 40 will trace out the contour of the internal chamber 14.The equations of the internal chamber 14 are therefore defined by adding the coordinates of the rotor centroid 42 to the coordinates of the third lobe 40, relative to the rotor centroid 42 x A B cos a R cos a 3 y A B sin a R sin a 3 where a ranges between 0 and 6 X, the equivalent of 3 orbital revolutions of the rotor centroid 42. With reference to Figures 6 through 12, the energy input assembly comprises a fuel inlet 110, providing a fluid communication between a source of air fuel mixture not shown and the internal chamber 14, and an exhaust outlet 112, which provides fluid communication between the internal chamber 14 and an exhaust conduit not shown . The inlet 110 and outlet 112 are formed in the front wall 22 of the housing 16.If desired, an additional inlet output pair may be formed in the opposite side of the internal chamber 14, in the back wall 24. There is also a spark plug 114. The operation of the energy input assembly may be understood by examining in series the movements of the rotor 12 about the internal chamber 14. In Figure 6, the angle a 0 and the first face surface 28 of the rotor 12 is about to move, as the rotor 12 rotates in a counterclockwise direction, so as to uncover the fuel inlet 110 and place it in fluid communication with the internal chamber 14. After the fuel inlet 110 is uncovered. reduction in pressure caused by the increasing volume of the internal chamber 14 causes air fuel mixture to enter the internal chamber 14, where it is confined by the third side surface Cf the rotor 12 and the walls of the internal chamber 14. In Figure 7, the rotor 12 has travelled to the position where the angle a 90 , and air fuel mixture 116 is about to begin to fill the cavity defined by the third side surface of the rotor 12 and the walls of the internal chamber 17. Figures 8 and 9 show the rotor 12 at the angles a 1800 and a 2700 respectively, as the volume of the cavity, and the amount of fuel admitted thereto, increases.The volume of this cavity is at a maximum at a 360e, as shown in Figure 10. As the rotor 12 continues to rotate in a counterclockwise direction, the inlet port 110 closes as the face surface 28 moves into overlying relation with the inlet ports simultaneously the cavity defined by the third side surface 49 and the walls of the internal chamber 14 decreases in volume until an approximate minimum is reached at a 6300, Shown inFigure 11. At this point the air fuel mixture 116 previously admitted to the cavity is highly compressed.At least one spark plug 114 is activated at this point, causing the air fuel mixture 116 to ignite and explosively expand, driving counterclockwise rotation of the rotor 12. Timing means are provided to actuate the spark plug 114 at appropriate intervals. As the rotor 12 continues to rotate in a counterclockwise direction, the first face surface 28 uncovers the exhaust outlet, 112 so as to place it in fluid communication with the integral chamber 14. The previously combusted airfuel mixture, now shown as exhaust 118, may flow out of the internal chamber 14 through the exhaust outlet 112, as is shown in Figure 12, where the angle n 9900. As the rotor 12 continues to rotate, exhaust is eliminated from the cavity defined by the third side surface 49 and the walls of the internal chamber 14.At a 10800, after three complete rotations of the rotor centroid 42, the third lobe 40 has returned to the position shown in Figure 6, and the exhaust outlet 112 has practically been closed with respect to the internal chamber 114 by movement of the first face surface 28 into overlying relation with the exhaust outlet 112.The cycle just described may then be repeated. It will be noted that opening and closing of the fuel inlet 110 and exhaust outlet 112 is provided for by motion of the first face surface 28 with respect to the front wall 22 of the internal chamber 14. Unlike the case with conventional reciprocating internal combustion engines, there is no need for valves, valve trains or reciprocating parts.Further, it will be noted that each cavity defined by the side surfaces of the rotor 12 is out of fluid communication with.the inlet 110 and outlet 112 while air fuel mixture is being ignited in that cavity. Thus, there is no danger of leakage through the ports during combustion carried out in the rotary motor 10. The operational sequence of the rotary motor 10 has just been described with reference to the cavity defined by the third side surface 49 and the walls of the internal chamber 14. However, it will be understood that at the same time, the same process is occurring wit the cavities defined by the first side surface 46 and the second side surface 48.The sequence of events involving the cavity defined by the first side surface 46 occur 3600 ahead of the corresponding events in the cavity defined by the third side surface 49 te sequence of events involving the second side surface 48 occur 3600 behind the corresponding events involving the cavity defined by the third side surface 49. For example, air fuel mixture injected into the cavity defined by the first side surface 46 is at a maximum volume at a 0 shown in Figure 6 , which is 360 ahead of the point when the maximum volume is reached for the cavity defined by the third side surface 49, at n 3600 shown inFigure 10 . Thus, it will be understood that there will be three ignitions of air fuel mixture, and thus three power strokes, in the course of one rotation of the rotor 12 about its rotor centroid 42. Seals are provided for each of the lobes 36, 38 and 40, in order to separate the cavicics de fined by each pair of lobe extremities and the peripheral wall 26 of the internal chamber 14. It will be noted that the cavity defined by each side surface of the rotor 12 reaches a maximum volume such as the volume occupied by the fuel 116 in Figure 10 , which is greater than the maximum cavity volume possible with a rotor of the same size, in an epitrochoidal internal chamber of the type known in the prior art. The cavity simultaneously provides a relatively small surface area in relation to volume, which minimize dissipation of heat into the housing 16 and permits optimal use of the combustion cycle for production of useful work. The rotary motor 10 of the present invclltionn offers a better compression ratio, and thus better engine efficiency than prior art rotary engines employing an epitrochoidal internal chamber. Additionally, the compression ratio attainable with the rotary motor 10 may be tailored to any desired level, including a diesel compression ratio, by appropriate sizing of the side surf aces of the rotor 12.It will also be noted that the three power strokes during a single rotor rotation offcrs a marked advantage over conventional internal combustion engines, which offer only one power stroke for each pair of reciprocating engine motions. As the rotor 12 is driven around the internal chamber 14 by successive ignitions of air fuel mixture by the spark plug 114, the external gear track 78 and the bearing 72 constrain the rotor 12 so that the rotor centroid 12 follows the oval shaped path shown in Figures 6 through 12. As previously discussed, this orbital movement of the rotor centroid 42 causes the circular converter member 58 to follow a circular orbit around the second rotational axis 88, which in turn drives the rotary converter member 60, by way of the bearing 86 and the internal gear track 76, to likewise rotate about the second rotational axis 88. with reference to Figure 2, counterclockwise orbital movement of the rotor 12 around the oval shaped orbit, plus counterclockwime rotation of the rotor 12 about the rotor centroid 42, causes the rotor gear track 80 to travel in a counterclockwise direction. Because the rotor gear track 80 is tallgentially cJ0cja jed with tic extel llal clear track 78 of the circular converter member 58, this movement in turn drives the external gear track 78, and thus the integral internal gear track 78 in a clockwise direction.Because the internal gear track 78 is in turn tangentially engaged with the external gear track 90 of the rotary converter member 60, clockwise motion of the internal gear track 78 in turn drives counterclockwise motion of the external gear track 90, and thus drives counterclockwise rotaiton of the concentric section 81 and thus the coaxial output shaft 20. This rotational motion of the output shaft 20 may be conventionally be applied to produce useful work. In order to determine the necessary gearing for the gear tracks 76, 78, 80 and 90, the radii of these gears will be designated respectively by the variables R , R,B, R80 and Rgo. With reference to Figures 1 and 2, the teeth of gear track 90 mesh with those of gear track 76, and the center of gear track 90 is symmetrical about the second rotational axis 88. The gear track 76 is symmetrical about the third rotational axis 62. Because the third rotational axis 62 is spaced by a distance A from the second rotational axis 88, this means that R9v A R76. The teeth of the gear track 78 mesh with the teeth of the gear track 80, and the center of the gear track 78 is symmetrical about the third rotational axis 62. The teeth of the gear track 80 are symmetrical about the first rotational axis 44. Because the third rotational axis 62 is spaced by a distance B from the first rotational axis 44, this means that R7 8 B Ro. With conLinucd reference to Figure 2, movement of the rotor 12, and the rotor gear track 80, drives the external gear track 78 in motion characterized as the sum of two rotational components al a and w b . The quantity tll a corresponds to the speed of the gear track 78 about the third rotational axis 62 the quantity w b corresponds to the rotational speed of the third rotational axis 62 about the first rotational axis 44a which occurs as the gear track 78 rolls around the inside of the gear track 80. The value of a may be calculated by use of the conventional relationship between gear size and gear speed for stationary meshed gears a 0 R7 8 a R8 0 so that a EMI17.1 SEP Ra SEP 0 tb SEP 8 SEP SEP 0 SEP SEP SEP . tb SEP R7 SEP 8 tb When gear track 78 rolls around the qear track 80 one time the gear ti ack 78 will have rotate about iLs OWI1 axis byEMI18.1 SEP SEP SEP 1 tb R7 SEP 8 tb revolutions. The rotor 12 is rotating at 1 3 the angular speed of output shaft 20 and external gear track 90 the gear track 78 rolls around the rotor gear track 80 at the same rotational speed as that of the external gear track 90. Therefore, the gear track 78 rolls around the external gear track 80 three times for each revolution of the rotor 12.Accordingly,EMI18.2 tb b SEP R8 SEP 0 tb SEP 3 SEP SEP SEP SEP 1 tb R7 SEP 8 tb Because 7 8 w a t b , therefore EMI18.3 SEP 4R8 SEP 0 tb 7 SEP SEP 8 SEP SEP 8 SEP 0 SEP SEP SEP 3 . tb R7 SEP 8 tb Because the gear track 78 is integral with the gear track 76, the two tracks therefore have the same angular velocity.

It should be understood that the foregoing values of A, B and R and R8 0 have been selected for purposes os example, and that the present invention may be practiced over a range of values for these constants. While a rotary engine having an internal chamber defined by the equations, x A B cos Cx K cos alpha 3 y A B sin a lt sin a 3 and a three lobed rotor, represent the preferred embodiment it should be noted that the present invention is not limited to a three lobed rotor, or to the particular internal chamber shape suitable for use with.such a three lobed rotor. More generally, in accordance with the present invention, a rotor may feature M lobes, where M is an integer greater than or equal.to 2. When the lobes are interconnected, they will form an equilateral polygon of M sides, if M is greater than 2, or a straight line if M equals 2. With such a rotor, the internal chamber will be defined by the equations. x A B cos a R cos a M y A B sin a R sin a M Where a ranges between 0 and 2nM radians, and where A,B andR are arbitrary constants. The foregoing internal shape is based on the constraint that the rotor centroid travels around the housing in the same direction that the rotor rotates about its centroid. However, it should be understood that another family of internal chamber shapes, suitable for use in practising the present invention, may be derived by prescribing that the rotor centroid travels around the internal chamber in a direction opposite to the direction of rotation of the rotor about its centroid. In this event, the pertinent equations for the internal chamber would be x A B cos a R cos a M y A B sin a R sin a M where a ranges between 0 and 2 M radius, and where A, B and R are arbitrary constants. The characteristic shape of such an internal chamber 124, having three lobes, is shown in Figure 16.A two lobed rotor 126 is utilized with such an internal chamber shape. In the embodiment shown in Figure 16, the rotor centroid 128 travels around a path which consists of a circle. The operation and construction of the output shaft, energy input assembly and orbital coupling assembly employed in such a generalized rotor and in internal chamber shape are the same as that previously described with reference to the three lobed rotor, and will not be repeated.
