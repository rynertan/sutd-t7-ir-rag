## Abstract
Process and device for the preparation of a product containing ammonium orthophosphate, and product obtained by this process. Phosphoric acid and gaseous ammonia are put together by means of a two phase spraying device A provided with two coaxial ducts 1 and 2 through the outer one 1 of which the ammonia and through the inner one 2 of which the phosphoric acid is passed. The axial outflow rate of the phosphoric acid from the spraying device is from 1 10 m sec. the axial outflow rate of the ammonia therefrom is from 200 1000 m sec. N.T.P. and the two flows are discharged within a cylindrical reaction zone B which is coaxial with the spraying device and has a diameter D of 2 4 times the diameter of the outer ammonia discharge durt of the spraying device and a length of 10 25 times said diameter D. The reaction zone debouches in a collecting space. A homogeneous product substantially free of ammonium polyphosphate is obtained.
