# Method for returning a movable part to the original point.

## Abstract
A method of returning a movable top guide 16 to the original point as defined by a frame 10 of a machine body. The method comprises the steps of first moving in one direc tion the top guide 16 to the frame at a high speed, moving the opposite direction the top guide 16 away from the frame 10 at an intermediate speed for a prescribed length of time after an overrun switch 26 set at a point a little beyond the original point is rendered nonconductive, moving in one direction the top guide 16 to the frame 10 at a low speed and stopping the movement of the top guide 16 when the original point 24 switch provided at the original point is rendered nonconductive.
