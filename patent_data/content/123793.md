# Room temperature curable resin composition.

## Abstract
A resin composition curable at room temperature and useful, for example, as a coating agent, an adhesive and a sealing agent. The composition consists essentially of A a polymer having both carboxyl and tertiary amino groups, the polymer being the reaction product of a 1 a vinyl polymer having both carboxylic anhydride and carboxyl groups with a 2 a compound having both at least one group containing an active hydrogen capable of reacting with the carboxylic anhydride group in the polymer a 1 and at least one tertiary amino group, and B a polyepoxy compound.
