# Ski with three dimensional running surface.

## Abstract
A ski with three dimensional running surface with a plurality of protuberances inclined with respect to the bottom plane of the running surface by rising towards the rear end 14 of the ski and the surface further characterized by a longitudinal pattern comprising a gliding region beginning near the front end 10 of the ski, wherein the protuberances 16a, 18a terminate in convexly shaped, drop off edges a transition region, where in the protuberances 20a terminate in straight, drop off edges, followed by a kick region roughly in the center of the ski s camber, wherein the protuberances 22 terminate in concavely shaped, drop off edges, followed by a second transition region protuberances 20b and a rear glide region protuberances 18b, 16b extending to near the rear end 14 of the ski.
