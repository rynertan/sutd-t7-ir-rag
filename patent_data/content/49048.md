# Fluorescent activated, spatially quantitative light detector.

## Abstract
A detector for sensing radiation reflected from an information bearing surface comprises a rod having a fluorescent dye dispersed throughout a generally trans parent medium and a photodetector at one end of the rod to respond to reradiated fluorescent light. The re flected radiation incident on the detector is absorbed by said dye and reradiated at the fluorescent wavelength, the reradiated light reaching the photodetector causing an output signal to be generated representing part of the said information.
