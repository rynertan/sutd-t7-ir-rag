# Transmission shifting mechanism.

## Abstract
A shifting mechanism 10 for a change gear trans mission is provided. The shifting mechanism includes a plurality of axially shiftable shift rails 16, 18, 20 and 22 each of which carry shift forks 24, 26, 28 and 30 for axial move ment therewith. Each of the shift rails is provided with a shift notch 34 and a interlock notch 44 all of which will align when the shift rails are in the axially centered neutral posi tions thereof. A shift shaft shift finger assembly 76 extends generally transversely to the shift rails and is mounted in the shift mechanism housing 12 for axial movement along and rotational movement about its axis 122 . The shift shaft 84 ts axially movable in the space partially defined by the peripheral surfaces of the interlock notches. The shift shaft shift finger assembly defines a gap 118 having a width 120 which is greater than the thickness 42 of one shift rail but less than the thickness of two shift rails and which is aligned with the shift finger 100 fixed for axial and rotation al movement with the shift shaft 84 whereby alignment of the shift finger 100 with a selected shift rail will align the gap 118 with the selected shift rail allowing axial move ment of the selected shift rail from the axially nondisplaced position thereof and will lock the remaining shift rails in the axially nondisplaced positions thereof. A single detent shaft 66 cooperates with neutral detents 46 and in gear detents 48 provided in the shift rails and an adjustable resilient detent mechanism 180 and or collars 158 and 160 provide verification of proper alignment of the shift finger with the middle 18 or 20 shift rails.
