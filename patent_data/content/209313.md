# CLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION CIRCUIT FOR A TIMER

## Abstract
A timing system Fig. 1 ordinarily includes a timer circuit 24 , a source 11, 14 of first clock pulses for advancing the timer circuit, and a circuit 16, 18 for reading out the timer circuit in delayed synchronizism with the clock pulses. In order to allow the timer circuit to be advanced by second clock pulses from a second source 29 , where the second clock pulses are asynchronous with respect to the first clock pulses, there is provided a synchronizing or storage circuit 32 for storing an indication of the occurrence of each second clock source pulse. The timer circuit is advanced only when there are present the stored indication and the next occurring first clock pulse. The stored indication thereafter is erased, in anticipation of receipt of the next occurring second clock pulse.
