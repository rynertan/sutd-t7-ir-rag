# Overwrap casing and method of preparing it.

## Abstract
This relates to the encasing of shirred casing strands for the purpose of maintaining the shape thereof during soaking and subsequent to the soaking until such casing strands are applied to a stuffing horn. Each casing strand is encased in an overwrap casing which is applied in tubular form and preferably is in the form of netting. The overwrap casing is shaped at least at one end of the casing strand to define closure panels by twisting the overwrap casing at that end of the associated casing strand so as to reduce the diameter of the overwrap casing and to facilitate the reverse folding of the over wrap casing. The opposite end of the overwrap casing may be closed in a similar manner or by a simple gathering of the material of the overwrap casing and the application of a conventional clip. This abstract forms no part of the specification of this application and is not to be construed as limiting the claims of the ap plication.
