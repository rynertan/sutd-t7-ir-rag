## Description
Process for the purification of zinc sulphate solutions This invention is concerned with the removal of impurities from aqueous zinc sulphate solutions and,more particularly, with the purification of impure zinc sulphate solutions such as those generated in an electrolytic zinc plant prior to the recovery of zinc therefrom by electrolysis. The hydrometallurgical process for recovery of zinc from roasted zinc sulphide concentrates requires that the zinc sulphate leach liquor generated in the process must be of a very high purity before an electrowinning operation can be carried out efficiently and economically. The common dissolved metallic impurity elements present in the leach liquor, such as copper,cadmium,cobalt and nickel, can be very effectively removed by addition of zinc dust to the impure solution, this process being known as cementation. We have now developed a method of enhancing the efficiency of the cementation process. The treatment according to the invention may be carried out prior to the cementation process or between two stages of a multi stage cementation process. According to the present invention there is provided a method of purifying an impure zinc sulphate solution from an electrolytic zinc plant of certain dissolved metals, such as copper,cadmium,cobalt and nickel,by cementation with zinc dust, characterized by a step in which the impure solution is contacted with a solid prior to purification by cementation with zinc dust, the said solid possessing at least one of the properties of adsorption and absorption.Hereinafter the said solid is referred to as the absorbent. The invention may include any of the following preferred embodiments. the amount of absorbent used lies in the range 100 milligrams to 10 grams per litre of impure zinc sulphate solution. the step incorporates two stages, the impure solution being contacted with the absorbent in the first stage, followed by a second stage in which the absorbent is separated from the said solution. the absorbent is contacted with the said solution at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solution at atmospheric pressure. the absorbent is contacted with the said solution for no longer than 2 hours. the absorbent is contacted with the said solution in at least one of the following vessels stirred tank reactor, fluidized bed reactor, static bed reactor, and a moving bed reactor wherein the bed moves either continuously or intermittently. after contact with the said solution the loaded absorbent is separated from the solution by at least one of the following means filtration, centrifugation, classification, settling and thickening. the absorbent consists of at least one member of the group activated carbon, carbon, diatomaceous earth, bentonite, limestone, basic zinc sulphate, metal hydroxide precipitate. the absorbent removes organic compounds from the said solution. the absorbent removes inorganic ions from the said solution. the absorbent acts as a carrier to remove particulate material from the said solution. the absorbent acts as a carrier to remove colloidal material from the said solution. contact of the absorbent with the said solution is made prior to the first stage of a multi stage cementation process. contact of the absorbent with the said solution is made between two stages of a multi stage cementation process. the absorbent is contacted with the said solution in a batchwise fashion. the absorbent is contacted with the said solution in a continuous fashion. the absorbent is contacted with the said solution in a counter current fashion.Background to the Invention The hydrometallurgical process for recovery of zinc from roasted zinc sulphide concentrates requires that the zinc sulphate leach liquor generated in the process must be of a very high purity before an electrowinning operation can be carried out efficiently and economically. The common dissolved metallic impurity elements present in the leach liquor such as copper, cadmium, cobalt and nickel can be very effectively removed by addition of zinc dust to the impure solution, in a process known as cementation. The term zinc dust is used hereinafter to describe zinc powder or other particulate zinc which contains a significant concentration of metallic zinc either with or without accompanying a zinc oxide b other metals such as lead, copper, or cadmium, or c other contaminants, present in lesser concentration than the metallic zinc. The previously mentioned elements, which are more electropositive than zinc, are displaced from solution with the formation of a precipitate called a cementate. The ease with which cementation can be carried out depends on the impurity element being removed, and it is well known that cobalt, in particular, is difficult to remove with zinc dust unless an activating agent such as antimony or arsenic is also present. The use of two additives together has proved very effective. For example, the use of arsenic with copper to facilitate cobalt removal is disclosed in B.P.126,296, and, more recently, the use of antimony and cadmium together in solution to aid cobalt and nickel removal is disclosed in Aust. Patent 90737 82. The cementation step may contain more than one stage, with different elements being removed to varying extents in each of the stages of the cementation step. Cementation is regarded essentially as an electrochemical process whereby the impurity metal is displaced from solution by an equivalent quantity of the less electropositive metal and both anodic and cathodic sites must exist near or on the precipitant surface. The structure of the deposit often determines the areas of these sites and therefore the kinetics of the reaction.The nature of the surface deposit obtained during a cementation reaction is similar to that produced during an electrolytic deposition process, but in cementation reactions the current density is not an independent variable so that the reaction rate is more often influenced by the deposit. For example, a dendritic deposit will enhance the kinetics of the reaction, while conversely, a tight coherent deposit would impede ionic diffusion and reduce the reaction rate. Chemicals that are capable of modifying the surface structure of electrolytic deposits would therefore be expected to have an influence on cementation kinetics. An organic chemical that is sometimes employed to improve the morphology of electrodeposited zinc is 2naphthol. Unless rapidly destroyed, traces of this compound or its decomposition products could also contaminate solution entering the cementation step. An additional group of chemicals that are very commonly used in hydrometallurgy are flocculants. Although mostly used to aid the thickening property of pulps, flocculants also have been found to improve the quality of zinc electro deposits under certain circumstances. It is unlikely that all the flocculant added to various sections of an electrolytic zinc plant to aid solids settling will be totally entrained in solids discarded from the circuit, for example, as leach residues. In many cases flocculants are constructed of high molecular weight polymeric chains and are inherently difficult to destroy chemically or physically. Therefore it might be expected that there will always exist a low concentration, for example 0.01 to 10 ppm, of flocculant in many solutions in an electrolytic zinc plant.Therefore it is possible that the performance of the cementation step could be affected by flocculants added elsewhere in the electrolytic zinc plant circuit. Flocculants have been added to a cementation process to ensure the cementation of smooth surfaced particles which do not adhere to each other and from which gas bubbles are easily detached Australian patent 473,591 . Other surface active agents have also been used to stabilize zinc dust cementates German patent 1,023,229 . It would therefore be expected that 2naphthol, flocculants, and their decomposition products would have a benign effect on cementation. Surprisingly this is not the case.Detailed Description of the Invention The applicants have found that the presence of certain organic impurities in an impure zinc sulphate solution subsequent to the neutral leach stage severely retards the rate of removal of copper, cobalt and cadmium during cementation with zinc dust. Addition of a finely divided solid such as ground limestone or activated carbon to remove these organic impurities by absorption leads to significant improvements in the rates of cementation of cobalt, cadmium, and nickel. The present invention is based on this discovery. The inhibiting effect of very small concentrations of flocculant on the removal of copper, cobalt, and cadmium in a two stage zinc dust cementation step see Aust. Patent 90737 82 is shown in Examples 1 and 2. In the second stage both non ionic and anionic polyacrylamide flocculants slow the rate of cobalt removal while the anionic flocculant appears to inhibit cadmium removal. In the first stage Example 1 , the anionic flocculant decreases the rates of copper precipitation and cadmium reversion or resolution to a small extent. The flocculants used were polyacrylamide materials manufactured by Allied Colloids under the Magnafloc brand. Magnafloc is a registered Trade Mark.The non ionic flocculant used was Magnafloc R 351, while the anionic flocculant used was Magnafloc R 155. The removal of flocculant with a finely divided solid absorbent results in a significant improvement in cementation. This is one feature of the present invention. It is shown in Example 3 that the removal of flocculant with activated carbon results in an improvement in the rate of cobalt removal. Other finely divided solids that may be used to remove flocculant include ground limestone and basic zinc sulphate, as shown in Example 4, although these absorbents were not as effective as activated carbon and are required in greater quantities. This is another feature of the present invention. The above list of absorbents is not limiting as other absorbents, for example bentonite and diamtomaceous earth, may also be used for the same purpose. Other organic contaminants, such as 2 naphthol or its derivatives which would be expected to have a similar effect as flocculants on cementation kinetics, are also removed by a similar treatment. This is a further feature of the present invention. The benefit of activated carbon pre treatment has also been demonstrated during continuous pilot plant operation of a two stage zinc dust cementation section Example 5 . This work also showed clearly that lower final nickel concentrations could be achieved as well as significant reductions in the cobalt and cadmium concentrations. This is a further feature of the present invention. The results of small scale electrodeposition tests on pilot plant solutions from the two stage zinc dust cementation section indicate that a significant improvement in current efficiency can be expected when the solution is treated with activated carbon prior to cementation Example 5 . This is another very advantageous feature of the present invention. The pilot plant tests have also shown that treatment with activated carbon and subsequent filtration resulted in significant removal of residual iron from the neutral leach liquor and a decrease in the iron level in the final purified solution prior to electrolysis. This is another feature of the present invention. By removing flocclant it is possible to use less zinc dust for the same degree of cementation of the dissolved metals. Thus, as shown in Example 6, if R 155 flocculant is present in solution at a level of 3 ppm, and the solution is not pre treated with activated carbon, more than twice the amount of zinc dust and antimony would be necessary to achieve the same final concentrations of cobalt and cadmium. This is a further important feature of the present invention. Flocculant levels as low as 0.3 ppm also produce a significant detrimental effect on cobalt purification, which can be overcome by an activated carbon treatment see Example 7 . This is a further feature of the present invention. The beneficial effect of activated carbon treatment can also be demonstrated for alternative zinc dust purification procedures. In Examples 8 a 8tod four different procedures were tested on solution to which known amounts of flocculants were added and the degree of cobalt removal was measured in the presence and absence of an activated carbon pre treatment. In each case the removal of cobalt is improved when the solution is reacted first with activated carbon and filtered. It is important to note that, even when very fine zinc dust is used, the rate of cobalt removal is greater when the solution containing the flocculant is also treated with activated carbon prior to purification see Example 8 c .The general application of the process to zinc dust purification methods employed by the majority of theWorld s zinc producers is an important feature of the present invention.Examples The process of the present invention is illustrated by the following non limiting examples. Solutions used in the laboratory batch tests were produced during operation of a 0.5 tonne of zinc per day capacity pilot plant the design and operation of this plant is described by I.G. Matthew, C.J. Haigh and R V. Paramenter in a paper entitled Initial PilotEvaluation of the Low contaminant Jarosite Process presented at the Third International HydrometallurgicalSymposium, 112th AIME Annual Meeting, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A., 6 March, 1983 . As part of the pilot plant operation a new improved two stage zinc dust cementation step Aust. Patent 90737 82 was tested. The use of finely divided activated carbon to remove impurities prior to this step was also tested in the plant on a continuous basis and the current efficiency for zinc electrodeposition from solution so produced was measured in small scale electrolytic cells.Example 1 This example illustrates the adverse effect that flocculant exerts on the decopperization stage first stage of the cementation process described inAustralian Patent 90737 82. In this stage copper is precipitated from solution and cadmium, which precipitates initially, reverts and completely re enters solution. Zinc dust 25 mesh Tyler, 0.228 gram litre was reacted batchwise with a stirred neutral leach thickener overflow solution 4 litres at 85 C for 1 hour.

For each of Test Nos. 1 6, listed below, decopperized solution 4 litres was treated with 15 millilitres of zinc plant spent electrolyte to achieve a pH250 of 4.0 and then with potassium antimonyl tartrate to give an antimony concentration of 1 mg L.

After filtration of the loaded carbon on a plate and frame filter press the solution was decopperized by addition of a 1.4 x stoichiometric quantity of zinc dust at 85 C in a series of three reactors. After filtration of the copper rich product, further zinc dust 2.0 g L and Sb 1 to 2 mg L was added and cobalt, cadmium, nickel and remaining traces of copper were removed in the second stage at 750C in a series of three reactors followed by another filter press. An additional 0.5 to 0.6 g L of zinc dust was added to the final reactor.Deliberate additions of flocculant were not made during this test but bothMagnafloc R 155 and R 351 flocculants were routinely used in preceding sections of the pilot plant to assist in settlement of solids. Test electrolyses of the final solution from the cementation section produced with the activated carbon treatment step in operation were conducted in pilot electrolytic cells using a current density of 500 amp m2 and a deposition time of 48 hours. The deposited zinc showed excellent physical properties and optimum crystal morphology as well as being deposited with an overall average current efficiency of 94.5 to 95 . This value exceeds the best current efficiencies obtained on present Risdon Zinc Plant cell feed solutions which lie in the range of 90 to 93 . Example 6 This example shows that the harmful effect of flocculant can be partly overcome by employing increased levels of zinc dust and antimony. More importantly, it shows that if the activated carbon treatment step is not used more than twice the amount of zinc dust and antimony would be necessary to achieve the same final concentrations of cobalt and cadmium.

In Examples 7 and 8 c the zinc dust was considerably finer with a median particle diameter of 9.7 Fm. similar to that in use at the Balen Wezel plant of Societe des Mines et Foundries de Zinc de la Vieille Montagne, Societe Anonyme. The activated carbon used in Examples 7 and 8 a 8 d was the coarse grade material 55 200 meshTyler . It was added to the solution to which the flocculant had been added previously at a level of 300 mg L, stirred with the solution for 15 minutes at room temperature, and then removed by filtration.
