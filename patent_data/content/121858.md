# Fumes control system for electric arc furnaces.

## Abstract
A fumes control system for use with a furnace having a top chargeable furnace vessel 10 mounted on a first support 16 with means 6 for charging the furnace adjacent to the vessel and means 24 for collecting the melt from the furnace adapted to overlie a second support 28 defining a tapping site adjacent to the furnace vessel 10 . The fumes control sys tem comprises a housing 30 covering the top and sides of the furnace in sealing engagement with the first and second supports 16, 28 and is adapted to entirely enc ose the fur nace and collecting means. The fumes control system further comprises exhaust means 40, 50 with dampers 44, 54 asso ciated therewith, which dampers are interconnected via con trol means to selectively exhaust fumes generated during charging, melting refining and tapping operations at the re spective sites.
