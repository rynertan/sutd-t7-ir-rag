# Improved rate of absorbency of substrate containing in situ polymerized monomers.

## Abstract
An improvement in a process for producing an absorbent composite wherein a solution of acrylic or methacrylic acid salts are applied to a substrate and irradiated to form a water swellable polymer in situ within such substrate. The compo nent comprises saturating the irradiated substrate with an aqueous liquid and then drying to a moisture content of less than 20 per cent by weight whereby the dried substrate exhibits rapid absorption properties.
