## Description
PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR THE AUTOMATIC ENAMELLING ANDPAINTING, IN DIFFERENT COLORS, OF PIECES OF CERA1J1IC , METAL OR OTHER MATERIALS, IN PARTICULAR CERAL.IC SANITARYFIXTURES, ELECTRO DOZ IESTIC APPLIANCES, AND THE LIKE. This invention relates to a process and an apparatus for the automatic enamelling, in different colors, of pieces of ceramic material, metal material or others, in particular ceramic sanitary fixtures, electro domestic appliances and the like. At present the color enamelling or painting of sanitary fixtures made of ceramic material and of electro domestio appliances made of metal material, is generally effected on mass produced series or sets of pieces to be enameled, a first series of which, as composed for example of ceramic wash basins, may receive a blue enamel, a second series, for example of w.c. bowls, also of ceramic material, may be white painted, and so on. These differently colored series of pieces are produced, enameled and finished to be then stored by the manufacturer according to a production plan which may result in great quantities of stored up pieces that are likely to remain as dead or unsold stocks, owing to the fact that the customer of that manufacturer may request enameled items differently colored from the pieces in stock. Moreover, the method of enamelling pieces in series which may also be great in number, is rather complicated and requires relatively long times, particularly when it is necessary to change from one spray gun to another spray gun of which the former delivers an enamel spray of a certain color and the latter a spray of enamel of another color.Also, it is not to be excluded the fact that some of the enamel spraying guns being remained for even a short time at rest may, when operated again, be unable to work due to their nozzles being plugged by lacquer that has set meanwhile. The main object of this invention is to avoid the above and other disadvantages by providing a process for automatic enameling, using different colors or lacquers or paints or the like, of pieces of ceramic metal or other materials, such as sanitary fixtures, electro domestic appliances, etc., characterized in that, during the travel effected through a spraybooth by a chain conveyor carrying in succession different pieces to be enameled, which may also be arranged in small series of pieces equal to, or different from one another, such as for example alternate pieces of w.c. bowls, bidets, and wash basins, at least one robot conveniently programmed from a central computing system and provided with a gripper means or the like at its wrist, automatically grips froa a suitable magazine a spray gun that will spray the above mentioned series of successive or alternate pieces with enamel of the color required by them, the gun being connected to a tank containing this particular color of enamel, in order to have said pieces enameled with that required color in 9 quick manner the robot, once enameling with said color is completed, bringing the used spray gun back to the associated magazine, then gripping another spray gun connected to a corresponding tank of another color, bringing it into position in the spraybooth and performing the enameling treatment on the piece or pieces designed to be coverd with enamel of that color, the different automatized steps taking place in succession according to a program more specifically, the robot gripper chooses from an associated magazine a single spray gun corresponding to the desired color, brings it into position in the spraybooth, remains in this position the time necessary for the spray operation to be completed, while accomplishing some appropriate movement to this end, then the robot gripper moves back to the magazine to hand over the used spray gun thereto, and, if necessary, it grips another spray gun using a different oolor of lacquer from the preceding one to automatically enamel therewith another or other pieces concerned, the process being oon wted in a rapid, automatic manner so as to permit the corresponding piece s to be enameled with the same color in very reduced times. The method described above may be modified in many ways as to the details of construction and handling of the apparatus consisting of the spraybooth, the work carrying carrousel conveyor, the handling robot, the spray gun magazine, and the computer which may be either an individual unit particular to this plant section, or a unit common to the whole plant, all of these possible variations and modifications being intended to fall within the scope of the invention so long as they are based on the inventive principle as set forth herein before. The method as noted above, provides that the spray guns, when at rest, are arranged in a suitable holding magazine from which the guns, one at a time, depending on the color required at that given tizae for that given piece s being treated, are taken as a function of the movements accomplished by the robatwhich is controlled from the computerized system by a particular software controlling all of the executions necessary for changing the spray guns. When at rest, the spray guns are periodically operated, for example each 20 to 90 s or 2 3 times in., in order to keep ir spray nozzles free from any lumps of hardened material and, thus, ready to work at any time moreover, at regular periods of time, each gun head is mechanically cleaned by means of 9 rotary or reciprocating brush. With the process of the invention it is possible to identify each piece under treatment through cameras capable of checking the shape characteristics of a piece to be enameled so that instructions can be imparted to the robot enabling it to go and choose the spray gun that will deliver the enamel of the color intended for the piece under control, at that time. For the identification of the piece s to be enameled, each piece can be provided with suitable means capable of informing the related devices in order to choose the color with which the piece is to be enameled or the identificat ion of the piece is mane via television cameras which send first to the computer, and then to a switching line, the information of the color to be utilized at that time. The automatic apparatus for enameling a great variety of pieces in the desired colors as set forth above is to be intended as making a part of a complete production line of which the apparatus of the invention is one of the operating sections said production line may include, in succession, apparatus for shaping the pieces to be ensmel ed, baking means for the shaped products, then the apparatus of the invention and, finally, drying means for the finished pieces.Instead of an individual processor or computer unit for controlling operation of the enameling robot, the spraybooth and the carrousel conveyor carrying the pieces to be enameled, the entire plant, comprising this particular and distinguishing section, may include a common computerized system which controls all of the various plant sections and, therefore, also the section comprising the automatized enameling spraybooth. It has already been mentioned that the described enameling process of the invention, and the apparatus for carrying out thereof, which ensure rapidity of the controls and, thus, speed of the working steps.connected with the various robot movements, of the pieces to be enameled and of all the spraybooth movable parts, permit a manufacturer to plan its production on customer order thereby to avoid blind production programs leading to store burdening stocks of pieces that are likely to become obsolete and therefore unsoldable in a short period of time.It is clear that the speed of work and the adaptability of the enameling means to operate such that dead stocks are avoided and a new, highly favourable production range can be established, cannot be a mere statement but results from the provision of automatisms, even of complicated design, which are to perform ,within and for the required times, those specific actions which enable to achieve the above objective, in particular the automatic enameling, also of individual pieces, with paints sprayed precisely on the piece or pieces ordered by a customer. The above and further features of the invention will now be described in full detail in connection with the accompanying drawings which show, by way of a non restrictive example, a preferred form of an automatic enameling plant according to the invention. In the drawings Figure 1 is a diagrammatic plan view showing the main parts of the patented apparatus for carrying out the automatic enameling process according to the invention Figure 2 is an enlarged scale view showing, on the right and the left sides, the robot pulse provided with gripper means, and, at the center, in diagrammatic form, the same robot utilized for gripping, one at a time, the spray guns delivering each a particular color Figure 3 is a diagrammatic side view of a structure for holding the spray guns when at rest, the spray guns being arranged in 9 line that, in this case, is at an angle of 450 to the floor and Figure 4 is a diagrammatic side view showing the part of the plant section making the subject matter of the invention, when the robot has already chosen a spray gun from which there will be delivered, according to a computerized program, precisely the color intended for that piece which is under treatment. Referring now to the above figures and at first to figure 1, there is shown at s an automatic apparatus adapted for carrying out the continuous enamelling process of the invention, said apparatus A including an enamelling spraybooth B through which are made to pass, one after the other, pieces C1, C2, C . . . .C6...C8...C11 to be 3 treated, which pieces are supported on respective supportsD, in this case there being eleven supports D secured to the chain t2 of a carrousel conveyor which is moved in the clockwise direction of arrow X in a manner knows.In this case the pieces to be automatically enameled in colors that may be the same or different, enter the apparatus in the direction of arrow Y, when the pieces are to be treated, and come out of the apparatus in the direction of arrow Z, when the pieces have been treated. Shown at F is a robot which operates on commands and information from a computer X in which 10 is an hydraulic station, 14 the computer itself and 16 a control board. 18 is the head of robot F and 20 the wnist thereof. G is a special magazine in which are arranged spray guns 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 connected to enamel tanks 41, 42, 44, 46 48, 50 respectively. It is noted that the spray guns 30,32,34...40 are arranged so as to lie in a line whose axis is sloping with respect to the horizontal plane of magazine G, this line being preferably inclined by 45 in order to make for the robot F to work under easier conditions when it has to choose that spray gun, from among the set of six, which is connected to the tank containing the color intended for enameling thhtpiece, among the various pieces on carrousel conveyor, whi h must be enameled expressly with that color. Reference is made now to figure 2 which showy on an enlarged scale, the parts of the robot adapted for gripping the spray guns 30 to 40, one at the time, as mentioned above. Shown at a is the robot wrist20 equipped with gripper P. The gripper P has jaws designed to open or close, on command issuing from individual computerized system or from a central processing unit of the whole plant not showns , to release or grip the shank 51 of that spray gun chosen from among the set of six such guns being shown by way of example in the drawings. Diagrammatically shown at b is the part of robot F comprising the head 55 from which the entire electro mechanical impulsion is derived and is transmitted to the robot wrist to enable it to perform all of such movements and handling actions as are necessary to result, in this case, and briefly , in moving said robot wristto near the robot programmed and robot operated spray gun, gripping said spray gun by gripper P and transferring the gun that has been released from the gripper of device 55 to be passed to gripper P on pulse 20 of the arm of robot F.As it should be apparent, when the robot y has attained the position F1 and assumed the proper posture, it will, by its wris olding the concerned spray gun, point said gun at the surface of a concerned piece C6 in the example shown a w.c. bowl which latter is, in a manner known, submitted to congruent movements so that these movements combined with the movements of the robot wrist 20 cause the entire surface of the piece C6, which is to be enameled with paint sprayed by thatgun,to be effectively and completely treated as required Assuming now that,after the thus enameled piece C6 has been carried out of the spraybooth B on carrousel conveyor 12, the next piece C5 is to be enameled the same color as the piece C6 then, no movement of any significance will be effected by the robot F and, when C has attained the position previous 5 ly occupied by C6, the surface of C will be sprayed by 5 the spray gun held by the robot grigper P, in the same color as before. Assume now that following to the pieceC6 having been carried out of spraybooth B which pieceC6 has for example been enameled the same red color as the preceding piece C7 the next entering piece C5 is to be enameled in green color. Than, once the piece C5 is in its correct initial posture, the arm of robot F moves congruently in response to instruction issued from individual system P, or the CPU not shown , to hand back the spray gun using the red er.amel mçpEed from a respective tank, e.g. tank 44, said gun, e.Z . gun 34, being received in the gripper of device 55. Then, the gripper P at the robot wrist grips another spray gun, e.g. the gun 40 connected with tank 50 containing the green enamel.In accomplishing the instructions from the center system, the robot.brings the spray gun 40 into position so that when the carrousel conveyor has stopped with the piece Cn facing thX spray gun 40, the spraying with green enamel directed on to the piece C is started and all of such handling movements 5 take place as are necessary to achieve the painting operation under the best conditions of treatment. When ename ing is achieved on piece C5 the same procedure as described above is repeated, with the movements of the carrousel conveyor 12, the robot F and the spray guns being at any time such as to enable the best work finishing to be obtained. however, an important feature is the identification of each work piece from both the points of view of the profile thereof and the enamel with which it is to be covered, and this again with the purpose of achieving an automatic and quick enameling operation that permits dead stocks to be avoided and work to be practically made on customer order. This identification of the various pieces that are presented, one by one, in the enznelltng spraybooth X, can advantageously take place by the use of a television camera capable of identifying the piece. to be enameled in order to transmit correct information to robot F, so that the robot, which is holding the selected spray gun namely the spray gun due to deliver the selected enamel , will be enabled to perform in a continuous manner the program already entered for each type of concerned piece. Each piece to be enameled may be provided with suitable magnetic means or targets capable of transmitting messages to the center system which enable the robot to select those spray guns that deliver precisely the colors with which the pieces are to be enameled as a matter of fact, said spray guns being working one at a time. From a technical point of view, the apparatus of the invention will obviously form one section of the line of production of the piece, which line can go from the step of compQ c ting the ceramic earths to form the piece, through the step of drying the enamel sprayed on the formed pieces up to the final step of forwarding the finished pieces to the customer. It is to be remembered that when the spray guns are at rest, or during the time when only one of them is used and the other ones are inactive, these inutilized guns, as arranged in magazine C, are periodically say each 20 to 120e or 2 3 times min operated so as to clear the respective çrw nozzles from material that is likely to set therein and to cause plugging of the spray channels.In this way the delivery nozzles are at any time kept free and ready for use. Moreover, an automatic brushing operation provides for mechanical cleaning of each gun head. Figure 4 is a diagrammatic side view of the apparatusA in figure 1 so that the parts shown in figure 4 are the same, and are designated by the same references, as in figure 1. From the above, it should be apparent that the disadvantages mentioned at the beginning, especially in relation to the fact of having to store quantities even high in number of enameled ceramic pieces or electrodomestic appliances, or the like, treated in enameling spraybooths, are avoided by the present invention, which pro vides for the described plant iutomatization enabling a manufacturer to achieve a business production that is substaçtially dependent on customer demand, rather than on trade reckoning which shows often to be unrealistic. If for example a customer desires to have, obviously with urgency, a set of five pieces each, of white, green, red, violet and yellow wash basins, this request can be satisfied promptly by delivering to the customer precisely those pieces jua in the restricted number of items as ordered. As already said, modifications may be made to both the automatic enamelling process of the invention and the apparatus for carrying out thereof, and may be in relation to either the steps of the process or the mechanical electrical and electronic parts of the apparatus, without departing from the spirit and scope of the panted invention.
