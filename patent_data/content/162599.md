# Level control for a fluidized bed.

## Abstract
Fluidized bed apparatus for use in applying a coating, having a relatively lesser density, to particles, having rela tively greater densities by causing passage of a gaseous at mosphere through a bed of the particles. The apparatus includes an enclosure holding a bed of the particles and means for causing flowing of the gaseous atmosphere car rying a material for forming the coating through the bed of particles to be fluidized. The apparatus further includes means 40 for adding seed particles 41 to the bed and weir tube means 56 removing coated particles from the bed when the contents of the bed achieves a predetermined level. Finally, the apparatus includes discharge means receiving the coated particles from the tube means and conveying them to a collection location 62 remote from the enclosure.
