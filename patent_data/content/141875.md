## Description
Process and composition for treating edible products This invention relates to a process and compo ition for treating edible products to maintain color and also to preserve the freshness thereof, for example, fish, meat, meat products and fruits and vegetables. It is highly desirable to preserve the freshness and color of edible products. For example, myoglobin, h moglobin and other like compounds found in meat are commonly believed to be responsible for the red and red purple color of fresh meat. Upon exposure to air these compounds are oxidized to oxymyoglobin and oxyhemoglobin which are bright red in olor. Exposure to air over prolonged periods results in further oxidation to metmyoglobin and methemoglobin which are brown or grey in color and which detract from the appearance d saleability of the meat. Conventional meat color preserving agents are known, such as ascorbic acid and or nicotinic acid, which function by reacting with the myoglobin and hemoglobin either before or after they are oxidized to form a color which is relatively stable over longer periods of time. However, continued exposure to the air will cause a further oxidation reaction with a resultant undesirable change in the color of the meat product to brown or grey. At the same time, it is well known that fresh meat products are susceptible to spoilage on storage. In order to keep fresh meat products from rapid spoilage, it is customary to keep them refrigerated so that the rate of bacterial growth is retarded. It is naturally desirable to provide a composition which is effective to still further retard bacterial growth and maintain the freshness of edible products. Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide a composition which effectively treats edible products to maintain a desirable color. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a composition as aforesaid which retards bacterial growth and maintains freshness. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a composition which is inexpensive, easy to apply and which is based on materials which may be safely used in edible products. Further objects and advantages of the present invention will appear from the ensuing discussion. In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that the composition of the present invention effectively achieves the foregoing objects and advantages in a simple, convenient and expeditious manner. The composition of the present invention effectively treats edible products to maintain the desirable color thereof, to maintain freshness and to retard bacterial growth. The composition consists essentially of 10 to 40 of each of the following components a a material selected from the group consisting of ascorbic acid, the sodium and potassium salts thereof and mixtures thereof b a material selected from the group consisting of citric acid, the sodium and potassium salts thereof and mixtures thereof c a material selected from the group consisting of sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and mixtures thereof and d a material selected from the group consisting .of sodium and potassium sulfite, bisulfite and 7metabisulfite and mixtures thereof. In accordance with the present invention a composition as aforesaid is applied to the edible product in an effective amount and is preferably applied to the product in an amount of from 1 4 ounce to 2 pounds per hundred pounds of product being treated. The composition of the present invention may be effectively used in preserving the color and freshness of fresh meats and meat products and finds its greatest utility in this application however, its use is not limited thereto and it may also be used to treat aged and cured meats, fish, fruits and vegetables. In accordance with the present invention, the product to be treated, such as cuts of meat or whole carcasses, may be treated by dusting the exposed surfaces with the composition of the present invention or by spraying the surfaces with a solution thereof. For carcasses, treatment may be accomplished by injecting a solution of the composition of theDresent invention into the arteries and veins.For ground meat, the treating materials may be applied to the exposed surface of the ground meat or added to the meat before or during grinding to permit distribution thereof throughout the ground mass. It is preferred in accordance with the present invention that the components thereof be thoroughly mixed together before application to the product. In accordance with the present invention, the ascorbic acid component may be ascorbic acid itself and or the sodium and or potassium salts thereof. Similarly, the citric acid component may be the citric acid itself and or the sodium and or potassium salts thereof, i.e., sodium or potassium citrate. Either sodium and or potassium carbonate may be employed.The sulfite component may be a sulfite, bisulfite and or metabisulfite of sodium and or potassium. The amounts of the components of the present invention are as stated hereinabove. Preferably, substantially equal quantities of each of the components are employed. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a suitable quantity of ground meat is first ground and mixed with a suitable quantity of the composition of the present invention and the mixture reground. In accordance with an alternate embodiment for red meats, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables, a suitable quantity of the composition of the present invention is dissolved in water and the edible meat product sprayed with the aqueous solution. Naturally, alternate methods of application of the composition of the present invention may be readily employed. Naturally, additional freshness or color preservatives may, if desired, be added to the product such as nitrates or nitrites, phosphates, nicotinic acid or other known color or freshness preservatives. The surprising feature of the composition of the present invention is the synergistic combination of the components thereof which effectively preserves color and freshness and retards bacterial growth for an inordinately long period of time far beyond what would normally be anticipated. The foregoing will be more clearly apparent from the examples which form a part of the present specification. EXAMPLE I A composition of the present invention was formulated by mixing together equal amounts of sodium bisulfite, ascorbic acid, citric acid and sodium carbonate. Fifty pounds of fresh red hamburger was first ground and then thoroughly mixed with two ounces of the foregoing mixture. The mixture was then reground and stored in a refrigerated condition at a temperature of approximately 350F. The resultant meat retained its bright red color and freshness for approximately two weeks. Untreated meat darkened after about one week and at the end of the two week period was quite dark and no longer fresh.EXAMPLE II Two ounces of the composition of Example I were thoroughly dissolved in two quarts of water. The composition was sprayed on various samples of poultry and red meats. The resultant sprayed samples were stored in a refrigerated condition as inExample I and maintained their color and freshness for approximately two weeks. Comparable materials lost their color after about one week and were no longer fresh after the two week period.EXAMPLE III A piece of veal which had started to discolor was tested in a variety of ways. Firstly, a portion of this material was treated with two ounces of a composition containing equal amounts of ascorbic acid, citric acid and sodium carbonate. The material was stored in the refrigerated condition at about 350F. After about three days, the material showed clear signs of decay. Another portion of this material was treated with two ounces of sodium bisulfite only L..der the same conditions and showed clear signs of decay after five days. A third sample was treated with two ounces of the composition ofExample I as aforesaid. The material showed no signs of decay after two weeks of storage.EXAMPLE IV A variety of experiments were conducted with a variety of. compositions on beef which had been previously stored to the point where the meat was starting to discolor. Composition A was 1 10 of an ounce each of ascorbic acid, citric acid and sodium bisulfite. The material thus treated showed clear signs of decay after five days storage in the refrigerated condition at approximately 350fez Composition B represented 1 10 of an ounce each of ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfite. The treatment conditions were the same as above and the material showed clear signs of decay after three days storage. Composition D represented 1 10 of an ounce of sodium carbonate. The meat showed clear signs of decay after three days storage. Composition E represented 1 10 of an ounce each of sodium carbonate, ascorbic acid and citric acid. The material showed clear signs of decay after five days. Composition F represented the composition of the present invention with 1 10 of an ounce each of sodium bisulfite, citric acid, ascorbic acid and sodium carbonate. The material showed no signs of decay after two weeks storage.EXAMPLE V Example I was substantially repeated using potassium bisulfite, potassium carbonate, potassium citrate and potassium ascorbate. The same excellent results were obtained as in Example I.EXAMPLE VI In this example, eleven individual packages of beef were prepared, cut into approximately 1 cubes. The beef had previously been stored for a period of 7 days. Each cube was treated witb one tenth ounce of the composition of the present invention containing equal amounts of ascorbic acid, citric acid, sodium carbonate and sodium bisulfite. Daily an unopen package was removed, ground under sterile conditions with sterile phosphate buffer, serially diluted and tested for aerobic plate count and coliform count. All samples were held under refrigerated conditions at approximately 350F during the course of the study. In accordance with this study, a bacterial population of below 1,000,000 per milliliter is the generally recommended standard for beef. The results are shown in the following table. TABLF. I Aerobic Coliform Color Odor Count 350F Contamination 1 Initial Count Good Good 220,000 1 2 24 hr. Count Good Good 240,000 9 3 48 hr. Count Good Good 240,000 4 4 72 hr. Count Turning Brown Good 260,000 4 5 96 hr. Count Turning Brown Good 250,000 1 6 120 hr. Count Turning Brown Good 280,000 1 7 144 hr. Count Brownish Red Good 12,000,000 1 8 168 hr. Count Brownish Red Good 16,000,000 1 9 192 hr. Count Brownish Red Good 20,000,000 1 10 216 hr. Count Brownish Red Good 150,000 1 1l 240 hr.Count Brownish Red Good 600,000 1 The results of the study clearly showed that the preservative maintained the bacterial population well below the 1,000,000 count per milliliter generally recommended as a standard for beef for the first six days of the study. This was supported by organalyptic testing. After five days the counts increased markedly to the tenth day. Coliform counts did not seem a factor. Spurious coliform counts on the second, third and fourth days were believed to have resulted from contai iination during the packaging of the samples. On the tenth and eleventh days, the counts again dropped so that the particular packages in question may have received more of the preservatives. The foregoing data clearly shows that the composition of the present invention is capable of maintaining acceptable bacterial counts for at least six days and possibly longer even after the meat has been previously stored for an extended period of time when the meat is held at normal refrigeration temperatures.EXAMPLE VII Several compositions were formulated having the following bases Composition I. Sodium Bisulfite Sodium Carbonate Equal Parts Ascorbic Acid Composition II. Sodium Bisulfite Sodium Carbonate Equal Parts Citric Acid Composition III. Sodium Bisulfite Sodium Carbonate Citric Acid Equal Parts Ascorbic Acid Composition IV. Sodium Bisulfite 85 Sodium Carbonate 10 Citric Acid 5 Composition V. Sodium Bisulfite 85 Sodium Carbonate 10 Citric Acid 24 Ascorbic Acid 24 A variety of experiments were conducted with beef. All experiments were conducted on the same piece of beef. The samples were cut into equal quantities and two ounces of each of the compositions were used to treat each portion of meat. All portions of meat were stored under identical refrigerated conditions and the condition of each portion evaluated daily for a period of sixteen days. The results are shown in the following table. TABLE II Color of Meat Treated With Formula Day I II III IV V 1 Good Good Good Good Good 2 Good Good Good Good Good 3 Good Brown Good Good Good 4 Brown Dark Brown Good Good Good 5 Dark Brown Decayed Good Brown Good 6 Decayed Good Dark Brown Good 7 Good Decayed Brown 8 Good Dark Brown 9 Good Decayed 10 3ood 11 Good 12 Good 13 Good 14 Good 15 Good 15 Good Sample III is the comoosition of the present invention.It can be seen that the meat treated with the composition of the present invention retained its good color characteristics for the full sixteen days of the test. The meat treated with Sample I, sodium bisulfite, sodium carbonate and ascorbic acid only, retained its good color for only three days. On the fourth day it was brown, the fifth day it was dark brown and on the sixth day it had decayed. The meat treated with Formula II, the formula without ascorbic acid, retained its good color for only two days.The meat turned brown on the third day, on the fourth day it turned dark brown and on the fifth day it was decayed. The meat treated with Formula IV retained its good color for four days. The meat turned brown on the fifth day, dark brown on the sixth day and had decayed on the seventh day. The meat treated with Formula V retained its good color for six days. On the seventh day it turned brown, on the eighth day it turned dark brown and on the ninth day it had decayed. EXAMPLE VIII A three pound piece of fresh codfish and.a three pound piece of fresh bluefish were cut into equal portions. A two pound portion of fresh scallops was divided into equal portions. Thirty grams of the composition of Example I was thoroughly dissolved in one quart of water. One of the portions of codfish, one of the portions of bluefish and one of the portions of scallops were left untreated and one treated with a fine spray of the aqueous composition so that the treated materials were thoroughly wetted. The treated and untreated materials were stored under ambient conditions. All untreated samples were spoiled in two days. All treated samples maintained their freshness for 25 days under the ambient conditions of storage.
