# Bacterial detection by nucleic acid hybridization, labeled probes and test kit therefore.

## Abstract
A nucleic acid hybridization method for detecting bacteria in a test sample, such as a mammalian body fluid e.g., for de tecting bacteriuria , employing a polynucleotide probe com prising a base sequence of at least a portion of one of the strands of a tuf or fus gene. Resulting hybridization between the probe and single stranded genomic nucleic acids released from bacteria in the sample indicates bacterial presence and can be detected by employing labeled probes or otherwise de tecting duplex formation. The method is particularly applicable to the screening of urine samples for the presence of bacteria belonging to the families Enterobacteriaceae, Psuedomonada ceae, and Streptococcaceae and particularly those of the gen era Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus, Psuedomo nas, and Streptococcus. The method provides a unique, direct, and rapid means for detecting the presence of bacteria without the need for conventional microbiological culturing.
