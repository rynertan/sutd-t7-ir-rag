## Abstract
A method of and a device for providing a concentric layer of wire material on a cable C , in which a number of wires G are taken simultaneously and in a tangential direction off a common rotating feed reel 27 on which the wires G are wound parallel to one another. The wires G are guided into the axial direction, are spread in the circumferential direction and are wrapped around the cable C , which passes through a ho low shaft 11 supporting the feed reel 27 . The method can be used both for armouring cables and for providing a screen ing.
