# VITERBI DECODER COMPRISING A MAJORITY CIRCUIT IN PRODUCING A DECODED SIGNAL

## Abstract
In a Viterbi decoder for use in producing a decoded signal by correcting and decoding convolutional codes, a majority circuit 46 is connected to a path memory 45 . At each of time slots for the respective convolutional codes, the majority circuit decides a decoded datum of the decoded signal by a majority of information bits memorized in the path memory as representative of survivor paths of a predetermined number of the time slots which include the above mentioned each of the time slots as a latest one of the predetermined number of the time slots.
