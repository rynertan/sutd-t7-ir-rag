## Description
COPULYCARBONATES OF PHENOLPHTHALEIN POLYCARBONATES AND OTHER POLYCARBONATES Polycarbonate resins have been known to the polymer arts for some time. Such resins are notably tough and rigid and have high softening temperatures.Polycarbonates of particular interest to the polymer arts are the polycarbonates cf the bisphenol A type diols. Also known are the phenolphthalein polycarbonates and the polycarbonates of similar trityldiols.Such polycarbonates are characterized by softening points significantly higher than the softening points of the more common polycarbonates of bisphenol A type diols. As taught in U.S. Patent No. 3,036,036, copolymers of phenolphthalein and other diols have been produced wherein the copolymers possess somewhat higher softening points characteristic of the phenolphthalein homopolymer polycarbonates. Unfortunately, the higher softening property attributable to the presence of the phenolphthalein in the polycarbonate has been achieved only by sacrificing some property attributable to the other diol of the copolymer. For example, in the case of phenolphthalein bisphenol A copolycarbonates, an increase of softening point resulting from an increase of phenolphthalein content is accompanied by a loss of impact strength resulting from the decrease of the bisphenol A content. Because different applications require different balances of softening point and impact resistance, it has been necessary to program a different polymerization procedure and or apparatus for each copolymer having a different concentration of phenolphthalein type diol and bisphenol A or other type of diol. In carrying out such polymerization runs, it is necessary to remove residual polymer from polymerization equipment between runs in which different polymers are being prepared. In view of the costliness of such practices, it would be highly desirable to provide a more economical method for making a more heat resistant copolymer carbonate containing phenolphthalein type diols while retaining the greater toughness characteristic of the polycarbonates of bisphenol A type diols. This invention is directed to a normally solid copolycarbonate of from 5 to 95 weight percent of a first polycarbonate of at least 5 mole percent of a trityldiol represented by one of the following formulas EMI3.1 EMI4.1 wherein each R is independently H, C1, Br, I, NO2, or an alkyl group having from one to six carbon atoms and from 5 to 95 weight percent of a second polycarbonate of at least 5 mole percent of a diol other than a trityldiol, the weight percentages being based on the diol content of the copolycarbonate. For the purpose of this invention, the term copolycarbonate shall mean a polymer of at least two different polycarbonates which copolycarbonate is prepared by reacting the polycarbonates.The terms polycarbonate of a trityldiol or trityldiol polycarbonate shall mean homopolymers and copolymers of trityldiols with themselves or other diols whereinThe diols are linked together through carbonate linkages. This invention is also directed to a process for preparing a normally solid copolycarbonate which comprises contacting a normally solid trityldiol polycarbonate with at least one other normally solid polycarbonate under conditions of shear and or temperature sufficient to cause reaction of the polycarbonates to form a copolycarbonate of the polycarbonates. Preferably the resulting copolycarbonate is essentially a single polymeric species. The copolycarbonate of this invention is similar in many respects to a polycarbonate copolymer containing similar proportions of the trityldiol and the other diol. As used herein, the term polycarbonate copolymer shall mean a copolymer prepared by copolymerization of one diol with a different diol in the presence of phosgene or a similar carbonate generating agent. Surprisingly, however, copolycarbonates of this invention exhibit generally better impact resistance and flame resistance than possessed by polycarbonate copolymers of the same diols. The copolycarbonates produced in the practice of this invention are suitably employed in most of the applications in which polycarbonates have previously been utilized. Applications of particular interest for the utilization of the copolybonates of this invention are as follows aircraft parts, e.g., glazing, light covers, interior assemblies, engine shrouds, windows and other transparencies automobile parts, e.g., air filters, fan shrouds, exterior components housings for electrical motors and appliances, business and office equipment, photographic equipment. In general, such copolycarbonates are particularly useful for applications requiring higher heat resistance than possessed by the homopolymers of bisphenol A and similar diols.

For purposes of this invention, the trityldiols are advantageously phenolphthalein and derivatives thereof, with phenolphthalein being preferred. All of the foregoing trityldiols may be prepared by known methods, for example, phenolphthalein by reacting phthalic anhydride with a monohydric phenol, phenolsulfonephthalein by reacting ortho sulfobenzoic anhydride with monohydric phenol, phthalidein by reacting bis p hydroxyphenyl toluic acid hydrated phenolphthalein with sulfuric acid, phenolphthalimidine by reacting phenolphthalein with aqueous ammonia, and fluorescein by condensing phthalic anhydride with resorcinol or a halogenated resorcinol. Of course, some of the derivatives of the forementioned compound may be made by halogenation or nitration of such compounds as is known to the art. In addition to the trityldiol, the trityldiol polycarbonate can contain residues of other diols which are generally free of aliphatic unsaturation. Such diols and similar polyhydroxy compounds can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic as such compounds are described in more detail hereinafter.In order that the trityldiol polycarbonates exhibit the desired high softening temperatures characteristic of their homopolymers, such polycarbonates advantageously contain at least 5 mole percent, usually from 10 up to 95 mole percent, and advantageously from 18 to 68 mole percent and preferably from 18 to 41 mole percent of the trityldiol based on the total diol of the trityldiol polycarbonate.For the same reason, the other diol is advantageously aromatic, preferably a bis 4 hydroxyphenyl alkylidene such as bisphenol A. While molecular weight of the trityldiol polycarbonate is not particularly critical, it is advantageous to make the polycarbonate such that it is normally solid at room temperature.Usually the weight average molecular weight Mw of the trityldiol polycarbonate as determined by gel permeation chromatography is from 6,000 to 50,000, advantageously from 24,000 to 35,000, and preferably from 24,000 to 29,000. The trityldiol polycarbonates are readily prepared by phosgenating the trityldiol or mixtures thereof in the presence or absence of one or more other diols as defined hereinafter. Alternatively, the trityldiol can be reacted with the bischlorofomate derivatives of one or more of such other diols.Detailed descriptions of methods for preparing the trityldiol polycarbonates are set forth in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,036,036 3,036,037 3,036,038 and 3,036,039. The polycaitonates of other diols herein called other polycarbonates are polycarbonates of diols other than the trityldiols described hereinbefore. Suitable other polycarbonates include homopolymers and copolymers of such other diols.Preferably, such other diols are aromatic diols such as the dihydric phenols represented by the formula EMI9.1 wherein A is an aromatic group such as, for example, phenylene, biphenylene, naphthenylene, or anthracenylene E is alkylene or alkylidene such as, for example, methylene, ethylene, ethylidene, propylene, propylidene, isopropylidene, butylene, butylidene, isobutylidene, amylene, isoamylene, amylidene, or isoamylidene or E may be cycloalkylene such as, for example, cyclopentylene, cyclohexylene, a sulfur containing linkage such as sulfide, sulfoxide or sulfone, an ether linkage, a carbonyl group, a tertiary nitrogen group, or a silicone containing linkage such as silane or siloxy R is hydrogen or a monovalent hydrocarbon group such as alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, or cycloaliphatic Y is chlorine, bromine, fluorine, or R wherein R is defined above m is any whole number from and including zero through the number of positions on A available for substitution p is any whole number from and including zero through the number of available positions on E t is a whole number equal to at least one s is either zero or one and u is any whole number including zero. Examples of such dihydric phenols include 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A , 2,4 dihydroxydiphenylmethane, bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane, and l,l bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane. The aromatic diols are preferred primarily because polyc arbonates thereof have generally higher softening points than polycarbonates of non aromatic diols.The preferred dihydric phenols are the bis 4 hydroxyphenyl alkylidenes often called bisphenol A type diols including their aromatically substituted derivatives. Therefore suitable but less preferred other diols include dihydroxy aliphatic or cycloaliphatic compounds which are essentially free of aliphatic unsaturation. For example, such suitable dihydroxy compounds include alpha propylene glycol, 1, 4 cyclohexanediol, 1,3 cyclopentanediol, hexamethylene glycol, decamethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, or triethylene glycol. The foregoing other polycarbonates usually contain at least 5 mole percent of one or more of the aforementioned dihydric phenols, advantageously at least 25 mole percent and preferably from 50 to 100 mole percent of dihydric phenol based on the total diol of said other polycarbonate. For the purposes of this invention, it is understood that the aforementioned mole percentages of diol for both the trityldiol polycarbonate and the other polycarbonate are based on total diol residue of the polycarbonate, i.e., pertain only to the diol residue resulting from the removal of the hydroxyl hydrogens of the diol and do not include the linking carbonyl groups.While not critical, the weight average molecular weight Mw of said other polycarbonate as determined by gel permeation chromatography is generally in the range from 6000 to 50,000, advantageously from 20,000 to 40,000, and preferably from 28,000 to 33,000.Preferably such other polycarbonates are prepared by a conventional technique involving the reaction of the other diol or a mixture of such other diols with a carbonyl halide such as phosgene in an organic solution containing a base such as pyridine. The copolycarbonates of this invention ad vantageouslir comprise from 5 to 95 weight percent, preferably from 25 to 75 weight percent, of one or more of the aforementioned trityldiol polycarbonates and advantageously from 95 t9 5 weight percent, preferably from 75 to 25 weight percent, of one or more of the aforementioned other polycarbonate, said weight percentages being based on diol content. By the terminology weight percentage based on diol content is meant a percentage that is determined by dividing the weight of diol residue of the particular polycarbonate by the total weight of diol residue of the copolycarbonate. Although not critical, the weight average molecular weight Mw of said copolycarbonate as determined by gel permeation chromatography is usually in the range from 6,000 to 50,000, advantageously from 20,000 to 40,000, preferably from 23,000 to 30,000. Preferred copolycarbonates, particularly wherein phenolphthalein is the trityldiol, bisphenol A is the other diol and the copolycarbonate contains less than 50 mole percent based on total diol of phenolphthalein, have yellowness indices no greater than 35, preferably no more than 20, as determined by ASTM D 1925 70. Preferred copolycarbonates also exhibit Vicat softening points as determined by ASTM D 648 56 of from 1500C to 2500C, advantageously from 1550C to 200 C and preferably from 180 C to 2000C. The preferred copolycarbonates are further characterized by excellent clarity, e.g., those exhibiting a light transmission of at least 50 , advantageously at least 70 , and preferably at least 80 as determined according to ASTM D 1003 61. It is further understood that the copolycarbonates of this invention may be the reaction product of more than two polycarbonates. For example, a copolycarbonate may be prepared from a homopolycarbonate of bisphenol A, and two polycarbonate copolymers of phenolphthalein and bisphenol A, each polycarbonate copolymer having a different concentration of phenolphthalein and bisphenol A. Other combinations are also suitable. Advantageously such copolycarbonates are the reaction products of polycarbonates of phenolphthalein and substituted phenolphthaleins as described hereinbefore and polycarbonates of bsphenol A and analogues thereof as described hereinbefore and in U.S. Patent 3,169,121. Preferably1 such copolycarbonates are reaction products of polycarbonate copolymers of phenolphthalein and bisphenol A and polycarbonate homopolymers of bisphenol A. The copolycarbonate of the present invention is prepared by reacting the trityldiol polycarbonate with the other polycarbonate. Preferably, such reaction is carried out by intimately mixing such polycarbonates under conditions of shear and temperature until the resulting reaction product is essentially a single polymeric species. Characteristically, such a preferred copolycarbonate, which is essentially a single polymeric species, exhibits a single glass transition temperature when the copolycarbonate is subjected to an increasing temperature scan using a differential scanning colorimeter.This glass transition temperature for the copolycarbonate normally lies between the glass transition temperatures of the original polycarbonates used to make the copolycarbonate. Advantageously, such reaction is carried out in a mixing apparatus capcS S oOt providing a low to moderate shear from 100 to reciprocal seconds, preferably from 600 to 3000 reciprocal seconds. Such apparatus include screw type extruders and screw type mixers, preferably twin scew extruders.During such shearing, it is desirable to maintain the reaction mixture in a heat plastified state.Advantageously, such temperatures range from 250 to 3750C, preferably from 280 to 3400C. Residence time of the reactants in the mixing apparatus will vary depending on temperature and shear. Generally, however, residence times are normally from 0.5 to 2 minutes, preferably from 0.5 to 1 minute, when the aforementioned conditions of shear and temperature are used. In suitable, but less preferred methods, such copolycarbonates are prepared at little or no shear by mixing the aforementioned polycarbonates in solution, for example, in methylene chloride or other suitable solvent and subsequently evaporating off the solvent, e.g., in a devolatilization process. Alternatively, the polycarbonates, in granular form, may be dry blended and then molded under conditions providing little or no shear as in a compression molding apparatus, a gear pump or a melt index apparatus. In such devolatilization or molding processes, however, it is necessary in order to achieve reaction that temperatures from 2900 to 3700C, preferably from 3000 to 3200C, be employed. Preferably, during the devolatilizing process, the solution blended polycarbonates are subjected to some minimal shear as in a devolatilizing screw extruder. The copolycarbonate of the present invention can be converted into moldings, films, fibers and coatings. They can be combined with various organic and inorganic reinforcing agents and fillers, for example minerals, and also substances producing special effects, pigments, dye stuffs, stabilizers against damage by ultraviolet light, heat treatment, and oxidation, lubricants, antistatic agents and other additives. They can be employed in numerous applications in which bisphenol A polycarbonates have also been used. In addition they can, in particular, be employed in applications whierein a high softening point and good resistance to impact and flame are important. The following examples are given to further illustrate the invention. Examples 1, 2, and 3 and Comparative Runs A, B, C, and D A 500 g portion of commercial bisphenol A polycarbonate homopolymer having a weight average molecular weight Mw of 32,000 and sold in granular form under the trademark LEXAN 141 by General Electric are dissolved in sufficient methylene chloride to form a 10 weight percent polymer solution. A dry powder is prepared from this solution by adding excess hexane to the methylene chloride polymer solution, filtering the resulting precipitate and washing the filtered precipitate with hexane and drying.A 50 g portion of the bisphenol A polycarbonate powder thus obtained and a 50 g portion of a powder of bisphenol A phenolphthalein polycarbonate copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 7800 and containing the monomeric species in a 1 1 weight ratio 58.36 40.64 on a mole basis of bisphenol A to phenolphthalein are dry blended using a simple roll mixer. The powdered mixture is then compressed at room temperature into cakes 2 1 4 inch 5.7 cm diameter x 1 4 inch 6.3 mm thick using a cylinder with a piston mold and a hydraulic press. After drying at 1300C for four hours, the cakes are placed between aluminum sheets and inserted between the platens of a hydraulic press held at 4200F 2160C . An initial force of 5 tons 4536 kilograms is applied to the cake for a period of three minutes.The polymer mixture of the cake is first melted, then cooled and finally recovered as solid, hazy disc having a thickness of approximately 1 16 inch 1.6 mm . The discs are cut into strips of 1 4 inch 6.3 mm width, and 5 grams of the cut strip is placed in a melt index apparatus ASTM D 1238 from which the orifice has been removed and its lower outlet plugged. The melt index apparatus is heated to 5300F 2770C and the ram is inserted and a l kilogram weight is placed on the ram. After 5 minutes the steel plug in the lower outlet is removed and hot polymer melt is forced immediately from the barrel. The foregoing heat treatment in the melt indexer is repeated two more times employing heating periods of 15 and 30 minutes. Samples of polymer used and obtained in each step of Example 1 are analyzed by gel permeation chromatography The results of the analysis of molecular weight distribution and the appearance of each polymer sample is reported inTable I.

Polymer Science,Vol A Z, p. 835 1964 . As evidenced by the foregoing data, Comparative Runs A and B are polymers having relatively narrow molecular weight distributions as represented by MW Mn but significantly different average molecular weights as represented by Mz, Mw andComparative Runs C and D show that mixtures of the two polymers result in a broadening of molecular weight distribution from 2.64 2.77 to 4.24 4.35.Examples 1, 2 and 3 show that as the mixture is heated at 530 F 2770C for a period of time the molecular weight distribution begins to narrow to the point as shown in Example 3 wherein the distribution is narrower than it is for either of the two starting polymers. The Mw of Example 3 being 16100, which is between the Mw s of the starting materials, plus the narrowing of molecular weight distribution from Comparative Run C to Example 3 indicate that reaction between the polymer starting materials has occurred. It is believed that the reaction products of Examples 1 3 either approach or are essentially single polymer species in the same sense that the polymers of Comparative RunsA and B are single polymer species.Example 4 and Comparative Run E A mixture containing 50.4 weight percent bisphenol A polycarbonate homopolymer sold under the trademark MERLON M50 F 1000 by Mobay Chemical and 49.6 weight percent of bisphenol A phenolphthalein polycarbonate copolymer described in Examples 1, 2 and 3 is prepared by dry blending granules of the two polycarbonates. This mixture is starve fed in granular form to a 0.8 inch 2 cm twin screw mixing extruder Welding Engineers using the following conditions barrel temperature feed to die profile, 4800F 2490C , 6000F 3160C , 6200 3270C , 6200F 3270C , 5750F 3020C motor, amps 40 and screw speed, rpm 150. The screw configuration of the extruder is such that each screw has a cylindrical section approximately midway between the feed port and the die and a reverse flight section near the die.The remainder of the screws comprise normal forward flight sections. The resulting extrudate is then molded into tensile bars on a molding machine Newberry Model HI 30 RS using the following conditions barrel temperature nozzle to feed profile 580 F 3040C , 6050F 3180C , 5900F 3100C and mold temperature, face cavity, 180 1800F 82 820C . The tensile bars are tested for impact resistance, softening temperature, yield strength, yield elongation, molecular weight, clarity and color. For purposes of comparison, test bars are prepared in a similar manner by molding a bisphenol A phenolphthalein polycarbonate copolymer containing the same amount of phenolphthalein and bisphenol A as the aforementioned molded bars. These comparative bars are also tested and the results are recorded in Table II.
