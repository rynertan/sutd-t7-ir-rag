# Method of and apparatus for manufacturing paper stringer tape for slide fastener.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus 10 for manufacturing a pair of paper stringer tapes 11 , 11 for slide fasteners from a pair of blank paper strips 11, 11 of a continuous length. The blank paper strips 11, 11 are fed longitudinally through a guide roller assembly 14, 15, 16, 17 . A pair of parallel spaced engraving wheels 20, 20 is spring biased against one guide roller 16 of the guide roller assembly. As the paper strips 11, 11 pass between the one guide roller 16 and the respective engraving wheels 20, 20 , a pair of continuous folding lines 21, 21 of a constant depth is engraved on the blank paper strips 11, 11 along the respective inner longitudinal margin 11a, 11a thereof. The inner longitudinal margin 11a of each paper strip 11 is folded on the folding line 21 to provide a doubled edge on which a row of thermoplastic coupling elements 33 is to be mounted.
