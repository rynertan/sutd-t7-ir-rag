## Description
I. C. ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS The invention relates to improvements in, and in the operation of, internal combustion engines running on hydrocarbon fuels. The object of the invention te to provide a means to reduce the noxious products of ctistion in the exhaust gas and to increase the overall efficiency of the engine by improving combustion, thus reducing fuel consumption It is known that, in present day motor car engines and other internal combustion engines, a good part of the fuel fed into the induction passages and combustion chamber is not fully burned.This is due partly to inefficient atomisation and vaporisation of the fuel before it enters the combustion chamber and partly to the mixture of air fuel not being constant under different running condition On account of the heavy nature of the fuels and other limitations, complete vaporisation of the fuel is not achieved in present day carburettors. The invention provides a method of improving fuel utilisation, and reducing noxious exhaust emissions, in an internal combustion engine having a carburettor for feeding a fuel air mixture to a mixture inlet tract1 said method comprising admitting to the inlet tract, to be carried to the engine after mixing with the fuel air mixture, a flow of hydrogen and a catalyst for the combusstion, the catalyst being a catalytic metal as such or as a compound in particulate form or as a solution. Provision may also be made for admitting and directing at least one stream of a heated gas air, recirculated exhaust gas or a mixture thereof to the mixture inlet tract to impinge upon and mix turbulently with the flow of fuel air mixture to vaporize fuel droplets therein, and in any event the hydrogen and catalyst or the catalyst alone may be carried in a stream of a carrier gas, heated or not. The invention provides further an internal combustion engine having a carburettor for feeding fuel air mixture to a mixture inlet, in which engine the mixture inlet has means for feeding said hydrogen and catalyst and, where used, carrier gas and or extra, heated gas streams to the mixture inlet and thence into the combustion chamber or chambers of the engine. Use of catalysts in solution, with extra, heated air or other gas streams is the subject of my earlier U.K. patentNo. 1 431 893 to which reference may be made for further discussion. The hydrogen may be fed from a separate source, but is conveniently generated in situ by reaction of steam with a suitable metal, in particular iron as filings or in other suitable, divided form. Conveniently the hydrogen is generated in and the catalyst fed from a single unit from which the hydrogen and catalyst pass together via a passageway to the mixture inlet together with any flow of carrier gas. A solid or other catalyst may for example be entrained in a flow of gas to such a passageway, which may conveniently be provided in a carburettor to inlet manifold gasket, without need for any other special parts in the engine. Specific catalysts are the following, in the form of the elements or as compounds as convenient clearly for example sodium or potassium is used as a compound Nickel Zinc Potassium Manganese Cobalt Aluminium Iron Antimony Sodium Copper Tin Boron ChromiumCopper in particular is good, for example as copper oxideCuO, admitted as such or as a compound converted in the combustion chambers. Such conversion is referred to in my earlier patent already cited, using a solution of a copper compound the catalyst. A heat exchanger may be provided to heat extra air by means of heat in the exhaust gases. For example the heat exchanger may be an air inlet tube passing through the interior of the exhaust system or alternatively or in addition wrapped round a pipe through which the exhaust gases pass. Alternatively or in addition, heating elements particularly electrical heating elements may be used, whether for heating gasps or for generating steam. Suitably inlets for a gas to act as a carrier gas for catalyst or to form gas streams as described above are provided with a non return valve set to admit the gas at a predetermined inlet depreasion below atmospheric pressure. Thus, heated air or exhaust gas or mixture, with a combustion catalyst and hydrogen, can be introduced into the induction passages of the engine. This gives rise to physical and chemical actions producing certain desired effects discussed further below. Extra streams, for example, drawn in by the depression present in the inlet manifold, may be one or more in number, and clash with considerable force, on entering the induction passages, with the air fuel mixture coming from the carburettor. The resulting turbulence causes breaking up of the fuel into finer droplets thus improving on the process of atomisation set up originally by the carburettor.Heat, acquired for example by passage of the air through tubing passing through the exhaust manifold, accelerates the vapourisation process so that, by the time the fuel enters the combustion chanber, it is in such a vaporised state that it is easily ignited and burns more fully. The introduction of air can ensure that sufficient oxygen is present at all times for efficient combustion to take place. Thus, with better atomisation, vaporisation, sufficient oxygen and the chemical action provided, the result is improved combustion and lowering or elimination of the noxious products of combustion besides improvement in petrol consumption. Embodiments of the invention are described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a side view of a device for attachment to an engine to carry the invention into effect Fig. 2 is a top view 9 . the device Fig. 3 is a view of the device from below Fig. 4 is a view of the inlet and exhaust manifold Trade Name of a Morris 1100 car modified to take the device of the preceding figures Fig. 5 is a view of a modified carburettor to manifold gasket for feeding catalyst particles Fig. 6 is a schematic partially sectional view of the device installed in an engine. In the drawings Fig. 4 there is shown a view of the manifolds of a Morris 1100 car engine modified to take the above device. The inlet manifold 1 carries the carburettor seating 2 and is joined to the exhaust manifold 3 at a hot spot 4. A mounting box S is secured to the exhaust manifold. This mounting box carries the device by means of a mounting plate seen for example in Fig. 1 referenced 6. This mounting plate carries two small closed chambers, chamber 7 for heated air alone and chamber 8 for a tube 9 carrying particulate catalyst for example copper oxide and exposed to a second stream of heated air. The heating of the air is effected by coils of copper tubing 10 and 11, well seen in Figs. 1 and 3.Air enters these tubes through metering jets 12 tube 10 and 13 tube 11 . It also enters the catalyst tube through a metering jet 14. The disposition of the device is best seen inFig. 6 which shows only a single coil, corresponding to coil 11 of the device of Fig. 1, but shows well the position within the path of the exhaust gases in the manifold. The Fig. shows also how the outlet nozzles, which are the inlet passages of the generai statement of invention earlier in this specification, pass through a plate 17 where the manifolds join at the hot spot 4, the nozzle from chamber 7 being referenced 15 and that from chamber 8 being referenced 16. Sundry variations of the construction, some shown in the drawings and others not, are of course possible.For example in Fig. 1 heated air additional to that drawn from the outside through the tube of catalyst particles is fed to the chamber in which the tube is mounted whereas this construction is not shown in Fig. 6.The supply of catalyst from a tube mounted on the device itself is indeed optional and may be superseded, or as shown in Fig. 6 supplemented, by a tube such as 9 with a metering jet 14 Fig. 5 mounted in a modified carburettor to manifold gasket 18. Further, an optional connection to a container for liquid or vaporous catalysts may be made to any of the metering jets 12, 13, 14 and 14 to supplement the solid catalyst, for example with catalysts such as those disclosed iX my U.K. Patent No. 1,431,893 U.S.Patent No. 3929118, Japanese laid open applicationNo. 18986 73, Belgian Patent No. 800,841, FrenchApplication No. 73 21499, Canadian Patent ApplicationNo. 206377 . A further optional feature with a coil 19 and metering jet 20 for supplying heated air to the reservoir 21 for such liquid or vaporous catalysts is also shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen from tha drawings how in the various constructions, air charged with fuel passes from the carburettor the base of which is shown at 2 in Fig. 6, impinges upon extra air drawn in as streams from the jets 15 and 16 and mixes turbulently with them spreading the catalyst particles throughout the charge as it passes to the engine through the inlet passages, the entrance to one of which is shown at 231 in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 also shows a small portion of the cylinder block of the engine at 24 and an optional water jacket 25 which is fed with hot water from the engine for use in severe climates to assist vaporisation. Alternatively, in hot climates, the water jacket may be fed with water from the cool part of the circulatory system of the engine and serve to prevent volutnetric expansion due to excessive heat from the engine interfering with the atomisation of fuel droplets. The metering jets can be provided with a solenoid valve or other control device and are cylinders made of copper or steel with a centre passage and ball valve and spring to ensure that there is air taken in only under inlet depression. Air is sucked in by manifold depression through the jets the diameter of which in the particular example is 0.3 mm but can vary for example from 0.1 to 0.5 mm or 1 mm. The use of an air feed to the chamber containing the catalyst tube is preferred so that a gentle flow of air through the tube itself carrying the required very small amount of particles is th2n fed into the engine by a larger flow of heated air passing through the chamber and entraining the air emerging from a tube which is perforated or otherwise formed to allow the air to pass.An alternative construction is simply to have a perforated tube containing a catalyst in the chamber without air bering drawn into the interior of the tube, sufficient catalyst being entrained by air, from a coil of copper tube such as 10, passing partly into the tube and carrying particles out of it. The very small amounts of catalysts required in any case mean that a tube lasts many weeks but it is made to be readily screwed out of the plate 6 for replacement or refilling as convenient. It is envisaged that disposable catalyst tubes may be made available. With respect to the carburettors of the engine, a slight adjustment or modification may be necessary, because of the improvement in the combustion process and the requirement for less fusel. do this in the case ofSU Trade Mark carburettors, the size of the needle is altered to limit or cut down the fuel coming through the jet opening. Alternatively, the jet opening can be modified to give the same result. In the case of other down draft carburettors, e.g. Solex, ZenithStromberg, Weber all Trademarks , all that is required is to have a smaller jet opening. All the above drawings relate specifically to the introduction of the catalyst. The supply of the hydrogen which is from a cylinder in these instances though it could alternatively be from a steam fed generator as in Fig. 7 below, is made as convenient, specifically for sample a tapping and inlet not shown to the chamber 8 Figs. 1 etc. so that it passes in with the catalyst. In Fig. 7 of the accompanying drawings is shown a unitary attachment for an engine designed to supply a stream of air containing entrained catalyst particles together with hydrogen gas to a special carburettor to manifold gasket and thus to the inlet tract of the engine, without other modification of the engine. The unit consists of two connected chambers 21 and 22 joined by bars 23 of which two are shown. Chamber 21 contains a replaceable catalyst containing tube 24 held within an outer tube 25. This catalyst tube receives air through an opening 26 and the resulting air flow, drawn in by the suction of the engine, passes from the tube through an outlet 27 and tube 28 to a mixing chamber 29 attached to chamber 22. Also provided in the chamber21 is a water container 30 fed as required by an inlet tube 31. This container is heated by electric elements 32 but may alternatively or in addition be heated by exhaust gas. Such gas may be passed through a simple straight through tube, such as tube 33 shown, but may alternatively be passed through a tube wrapped around the water container. Whichever means of heating is used, steam passes from the water container through a tube to chamber 22,where it passes through a bed 35 of iron filings or the like in which hydrogen is generated. The hydrogen then passes through a tube 36 to a water trap 37 and thence to the mixing chamber 29. In chamber 21 is shown an optional coiled tube 38 through which air may pass from an inlet 39 through the tube itself and thence to Chamber 22 and the mixing chamber 29 after being heated in the chamber 21. Vents 40 and 41 are provided in the chambers 21 and 22 respectively to ensure that no build up of gas pressure within them can occur. The unit as shown therefore passes a mixture of steam, hydrogen, and catalyst particles entrained in an air flow, together with extra heated air if required to the engine and gives the benefits discussed earlier in relation to the other embodiments.
