# Combustor for gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
The combustor employs an array of fuel injectors 19 arranged in the mouth plane of the combustor flame tube 15 17 . Each injector 19 has a baffle plate 44 through which the injector nozzle 33 projects, the baffle plate 44 having axial holes 49 for atomisation air to intercept and atomise radial fuel jets from the injector nozzle 33 . Cooling of the flame tube 15 17 is performed by full coverage impingement and effusion without disturbing the cooling film by entry and penetration of transverse air jets. Flame stabilisation is achieved under all required operating conditions by the ra dial fuel axial air atomisation in conjunction with the baffle plates 44 . Comprehensive combustion mixing and dilution is achieved by the uniformly distributed supply of up to 90 of the total air supplied to the combustor around and through the baffle plates. There is a resultant economy in the air used for cooling, a uniformity of temperature distribution, stability of operation, and minimal emission of oxides of nitrogen.
