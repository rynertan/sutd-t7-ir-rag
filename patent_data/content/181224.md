## Description
This invention relates to capillary viscometers. More specifically, it relates to differential pressure capillary viscometers which may be used alone to measure the viscosity of fluids or together with a chromatograph to obtain accurate viscosity information for determining molecular weight distributions. Accurate measurements of fluid viscosity are important in many industries. A capillary viscometer is often used to measure the absolute viscosity of a given fluid. For many purposes, however, it is necessary to know the relative viscosity of two fluids. Relative viscosity is often determined experimentally by measuring the absolute viscosity of each fluid separately with a capillary viscometer and then calculating the ratio. Relative viscosity is of particular importance in polymer research and manufacturing since it can be used to measure molecular weights and to determine molecular weight distributions, which provide important information relating to the physical properties of polymers. A comparison of the viscosity behavior of too polymers of the same molecular weight, for example, is used as a measure of the degree of branching. One of the oldest means used to obtain such information is to measure the viscosity of a known concentration of a polymer in a solvent. By utilizing the ratio of the viscosity of the polymer solvent solution, η where is the mathematical symbol meaning limit of the quantity when the concentration C approaches zero Prior art viscometers have been designed to measure viscosities in a number of ways. An early device used a single capillary of known diameter and length. Both the volume rate of flow of the solution and the pressure drop for flow through the capillary are measured. The pressure drop is usually measured by an electrical signal generated by a pressure transducer. The various viscosities are then calculated from the known geometrical parameters of the capillary. These types of prior art viscometers have proved to be inaccurate because of signal to noise problems in the signal generated by the pressure transducer. Part of this problem is due to high frequency pumping noise and back pressure fluctuations. The former is caused by the reciprocating action of the high frequency pumps commonly used to move solvent and polymer solution through the viscometer. Back pressure fluctuations cause flow rate fluctuations and occur when the sample solution goes through various high resistant elements such as end frits, valves, connectors and the capillary tube itself. A significant part of this problem is due to actual flow rate fluctuations. These can occur for a number of reasons such as whenever the polymer sample is injected into the solvent stream. Sample injection upsets the flow rate, and noise is generated which hinders accurate viscosity measurement. Accordingly, measuring viscosity independent of flow rate fluctuations is critical to accurate viscosity readings. Viscosity measurements are also very sensitive to temperature fluctuations. These can occur then the temperature of the solvent supply is not controlled carefully and is affected by environmental temperature changes. Sample injection can also cause temperature upsets. Measuring viscosity independent of temperature fluctuations is therefore important in obtaining accurate viscosity measurements. An improved viscometer described in U.S. Patent 3,808,877, granted May 7, 1974, to David E. Blair and assigned to the present applicant sought to solve some of these problems. The Blair viscometer used a flow restrictor between the solvent supply and capillary to try to maintain the flow rates constant. Also, it measured relative viscosity by taking separate pressure drop measurements, first when polymer solution and then When pure solvent flowed through the capillary. In its preferred embodiment, two capillary tubes were arranged in parallel, one filled with polymer solution and the other only with solvent. In another version, the two tubes were connected in series, with pure solvent flowing through one and polymer solution through the other, and the pressure drop across each was measured. In each case, the capillary tubes had to be exactly matched so as to be identical in diameter and length. Otherwise, the pressure drops across both would not be equal for a given flow rate. If, however, the capillaries were not maintained at the identical temperature, they became unmatched in pressure drop, which resulted in lower sensitivity. Fluctuations in flow rate as well as temperature also adversely affected the accuracy of Blair s relative viscosity measurements. A capillary viscometer which is similar to Blair s preferred parallel arrangement for measuring the differential pressure across a capillary bridge is described in U.S. Patent 4,463,598 granted August 7, 1984, to Max A. Haney. This device, as in the case of Blair s, requires the capillaries to be matched. Also, Haney, like Blair, does not compensate for flow rate and temperature fluctuations in real time when it measures the differential pressure drops. Consequently, neither Blair nor Haney provides viscosity measurements independent of flow rate and temperature fluctuations. A more accurate viscometer is also needed in size exclusion chromatography SEC such as gel permeation chromatography GPC analysis. This technique has become widely used because of its ability to separate polymeric materials in a dilute solution according to molecular size. It utilizes columns containing porous packings which are capable of separating the molecules in a multicomponent polymer sample according to their size. The polymer components migrate through the column at different velocities and elute separately from the column at different times. The largest polymer molecules elute first and the smallest molecules last. By detecting the amount of polymer fractions in the eluant, a GPC elution curve is generated which reflects the molecular weight distribution of the multicomponent polymer sample. In a GPC device, a detector is commonly used for providing the weight concentration profile of the elution curve. The polymer sample concentration profile is commonly obtained by using a differential refractometer. Molecular weight information is provided indirectly by the time of elution also referred to as retention time of the different polymer components in the sample. By using standardized correlations, which are often not available, the molecular weight distribution of the polymer sample could be calculated. One major drawback with this type of instrument is that it does not directly measure the molecular weight of polymer molecules as they elute from the GPC columns. Also, there is no calibration of the GPC peak retention times with the polymer molecular weight. Rather, it is necessary to assume some relationship between retention times and molecular weights over a wide range of different polymer structures. Quite obviously, a detector which will provide a means for measuring molecular weight directly is preferable. A continuous capillary type viscometer was proposed for GPC analysis by A. C. Ouano in J. Polym. Sci. Part A 1, These GPC viscosity detectors, however, remain inaccurate because the pressure drop ΔP signals are still subject to flow rate and temperature fluctuations. While the improvements described in Blair in U.S. Patent 3,808,877 might help somewhat in GPC analysis as suggested by Haney in U.S. Patent 4,463,598, there remains a need for an accurate means for measuring viscosity which is truly independent of fluctuations in flow rate and temperature. The present invention overcomes the problems associated with the prior art devices by eliminating the need for matched capillaries and by eliminating the dependence of the relative viscosity measurement on fluctuations in flow rate and temperature. The present invention provides a method for measuring either the intrinsic or inherent viscosity of a solute in solution with a solvent which is independent of flow rate and temperature fluctuation, the method comprising the steps of The present invention also provides apparatus for accomplishing this process comprising The invention may also be employed with GPC or other SEC analysis means to obtain information on the molecular weight distribution of polymer material. The invention may also be used as an in line process monitor or as a stand alone viscometer. While the present invention is described herein with reference particularly to polymer solvent solutions, it should be understood that the invention may be used with other sample and referencing liquids wherever accurate viscosity measurements are needed. Thus, the viscosity of other sample liquids may be readily calculated from the relative viscosity measurement where the viscosity of the referencing liquid is known. The present invention utilizes two capillaries arranged in series. A pressure transducer is connected across each capillary to monitor simultaneously the pressure drop of fluid flowing through each tube. The pressure drop measured across the first, or analytical capillary, will correspond to the sample liquid, in this case, the polymer solvent solution, ΔP The signals of the pressure drop across the analytical capillary, ΔP Real time signal processing of the simultaneous pressure drops across the analytical and reference capillaries eliminates the effects of flow rate and temperature fluctuations in the capillaries. The real time signal processing means can be accomplished using an analog divider as described in Burr Brown Operation Amplifier Design and Applications 1971 McGraw Hill p. 279 or by a high speed computer which reads the signals ΔP The pressure drop ΔP signal generated by the pressure transducer is related to the viscosity of fluid flowing through the capillary in accordance with the following relationship The problem can be eliminated when an analog divider or computer based real time signal processor is used to generate the net signal, S . S will be determined as follows G₁ or G₂ is initially adjusted while pumping one fluid through the system so that After this adjustment, S is now a direct measure of the relative viscosity of the fluids flowing throught the capillaries and is independent of flow rate. Also, this problem can be eliminated when a differential logarithmic amplifier is used since the net signal S will be determined as follows where as noted earlier η By adjusting the gains in each ΔP signal electronically so as to match G₁ K₁ and G₂ K₂, the net signal will equal the natural logarithm of the relative viscosity where polymer weight concentration C can be determined by a detector such as the differential refractometer located in the fluid flow path. The signal output is independent of flow rate and temperature fluctuations and responds only to the polymer viscosity. Moreover, there is no need to match the capillaries. The invention can best be described with reference to the following figures, in which FIG 1 illustrates one embodiment of the viscometer of the present invention which can be used in batch sample viscosity determinations. Two capillaries are arranged in series. The first is the reference capillary Connected across each respective capillary are pressure transducers Solvent is introduced from a reservoir Solvent is pumped to the reference capillary through a flow resistor A third flow resistor A concentration detector In operation, the viscometer of FIG 1 will generate two separate signal detector traces for recording. The signals from pressure transducers The flow rate independence of this viscometer has been demonstrated by intentionally varying the flow rate. As shown in FIG 3, the amplitudes of the viscosity traces remain essentially unchanged as the flow rate is nearly doubled. The sample used in FIG 3 was polystyrene having a molecular weight of 4000 in THF solvent at 2 percent weight concentration. The middle three amplitude spikes from the output of differential logarithmic amplifier are essentially identically as the flow rate is increased from 0.60 ml min to 1.0 ml min. A decrease in amplitude begins to occur as the flow rate is further increased to 1.25 ml min right and 1.5 ml min left . In prior art devices, the amplitude of the viscosity signal would have approximately doubled with a doubling in flow rate. FIG 4 illustrates a second embodiment of the viscometer of the present invention where like elements are designated by the same reference numerals. The viscometer here is used as a GPC viscosity detector, but it should be understood that other separation devices could also be used. A GPC column set While the operation of the GPC viscosity detector will be described with reference to the schematic of FIG 4, it should be understood that the viscometer of FIG 1 could have been used also, modified only by adding a GPC or other SEC column set between the sample injection loop A multicomponent polymer mixture sample is injected through sample loop The ΔP viscosity detection traces will also occur at the corresponding retention time since each component will generate a pressure drop signal across the analytical capillary The ΔP signals are fed to a differential logarithmic amplifier which will process them as explained above and generate traces corresponding to the natural logarithm of the relative viscosity ℓn η FIG 5 graphically illustrates these recorded traces for 3 component polystyrene mixture of 0.25 percent weight concentration in THF solvent flowing at the rate of 2 ml min. The top recording shows the concentration profile of the repeated GPC separation of the 3 component mixture as detected by a differential refractometer. The bottom trace records the same GPC separation, but with the viscometer signal of the log amplifier output. The viscometer response is shown, as expected, as being highly biased in favoring the detection of the high molecular weight component. The close similarity of the traces for repeat GPC runs demonstrates the good reproducibility of the viscometer for GPC and other SEC applications. This is due to the fine baseline stability as shown in the lower trace which is due in turn to the removal of the dependence on flow rate and temperature upsets and variations. Flow rate independence is more clearly demonstrated in FIG 6 in which the same three component polystyrene mixture is used but at slower flow rates. In the traces at the left a flow rate of 1.5 ml min is used while at the right, 1.0 ml min. As expected, the separation spreads out with longer elution times at the slower flow rate. The viscosity responses i.e., the height of the ℓn η The foregoing also illustrates the independence of the present invention to temperature fluctuations. As noted earlier, temperature control is important in conventional capillary viscometers since small temperature variations in the liquids can greatly affect the accuracy of the viscosity measurements. No special temperature controls are necessary with the present invention. Due to the real time signal processing and the capillary arrangements, temperature fluctuations do not affect the accuracy of the viscosity measurement. This is because the liquid in the analytical and reference capillaries will essentially be at the same temperature each time the relative viscosity signal is processed in real time from the simultaneous pressure drops across each capillary. While several embodiments and applications of the present invention have been shown and described, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art that many more modifications and applications are possible without departing from the invention, the scope of which is defined by the following claims. In the apparatus, the solution supply means may comprise a valve for introducing the solute sample, and a restricted flow by pass around the valve to provide continuous solvent flow during switching of the valve. Thus, in the method of determining the molecular weight distribution of polymer materials, the step of passing the sample through column means further comprises introducing the sample into the solvent through the valve. Also in the said method, a dilution means may be employed between the capillary tubes to ensure that essentially only solvent flows through the second capillary tube while the pressure drops across both capillary tubes are being measured. The apparatus may further comprise a flow resistor before the first capillary tube and a flow resistor after the second capillary tube. In the method of measuring the viscosity of a sample liquid, the reference liquid is preferably a solvent for the sample liquid. The viscosity of the reference liquid is preferably a known value.
