# Settling device for hair combs.

## Abstract
The invention foresees a small base 1 equipped with parallel vertical seats 3 for upright settling hair combs. It avoids the fortuitous laying of the combs on shelves and thinghs which causes hampering and may turn out to be polluting the room, by a means to be positioned on a shelf or wall allowing battery positioning so as to be promptly caught out.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1 Hair comb settling device characterized by the fact that a differently shaped base can be used, to directly accomodate on a shelf or to be equipped with means to fit on the wall, which on the upper shelf foresees a system of parallel vertical splits apt to act as accommodation seats in upright position of the combs for hair. 2 Hair comb settling device, according to the previous claim, characterized by the fact that, in a version, the accommodation seats are foreseen at regular intervals. 3 Hair comb settling device, according to the previous claims, characterized by the fact that, in a version, the accommodation seats are foreseen at different intervals in order to suit the catching space of devices having different shape and, therefore, different catching features. 4 Hair comb settling device, as per the above claims, characterized by the fact that the version foresees a monolithic settler 1 in wood essences, with continuous lower base having five reliefs 2 determining four parallel seats 3 and corresponding upper openings 4 for inserting the combs in upright position.

## Description
Settling device for hair combs .The invention refers to a settling device for hair combs to be lodged on a shelf or a wall, which substantially allows a battery positioning apt to be easily noticed and promptly taken up.This permits immediate operation when choosing the comb to use each tme and its prompt employ.The problem at present has not been solved and the combs are ge nerally laid down in battery freely on leaning shelves in bath rooms or where alternatively the body is cured. This occasional settling the combs on shelves and things implies the necessity of large space, is hampering and particularly turns out polluting the room. To try and limit these inconveniences, in limited space settlings and few employ devices, one prefers to insert the combs into the bristles of the hair brushes. This solution reduces the device encumbering, avoids the direct contact of the combs with shelves and things, and pre s ets them for catbh condition, but it turns out to begot hygienic, irrational in disposition and polluting the two devices thus put in contact.The invented device permits the solution of the problem through the use of a separate means of positioning which reduces the incumbering volume to the minimum rationally admissible, separates the comb both in the cumulative and in the singular sense from the surrounding room, prepares t in advance ih its natural selection position and for being taken out. This is possible thro ugh the circumstances that a small base is used which can be differently shaped, to directly position on a shelf and to equip with a fitting means to the wall which, on a higher shelf, foresees a system of vertical parallel splits at regular intervals, fit to act as positioning upright seats for hair combs.In a version, the positioning seat are foreseen at regular intervals in another version, they are foreseen atdifferent inter vals to allow space suiting for different shaped devices and, therefore, with several features of catch.A not limiting form of execution and, therefore, merely indicative is illustrated by the drawings of Tablet, where fig. 1 is the perspective view of a settling device equipped with four positioning seats foreseen with equal intervals. The accomodation of two combs can be noticed in the sad device. The upright position of the combs and the interval foreseen between them permits an easy insertion and the manual catch on their back. Fig. 2 is the longitudinal section of the settling device showing a comb in the accommodation seat. Fig. 3 is the side view of the same device. The version foresees a monolithic device 1 in wood essences with continuous lower base with five reliefs2 determining four seats 3 in parallel and corresponding upper openings 4 for the comb in sertion in upright position.In particular, settling devices are foreseen in wood essences, ceramic materials and porcelain, metal and plastic materials pro duced according to the conventional proceedings. The settling device shape, the number and shape of the positioning seats, the interval graduation, the materials that can be used either singularly or differently combined or integrated, may be optional.The accomodation seats, in particular, may be set in alternative to the parallel position.
