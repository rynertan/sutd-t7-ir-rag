## Description
Combination locks with decorative faceplatesField of the inventionThis invention relates to articles of luggage hardware, more particularly combination locks and the like. A combination lock for use on a luggage case may, for example, include a lock casing containing the locking mechanism and a faceplate member having openings through which portions of combination manipulating elements, such as dials, project.Background ArtGenerally, a lock of the above type, when attached to a wall portion of a luggage or like article, has only the faceplate member exposed on the exterior of the article and the lock casing fits in an opening in the wall portion, so that it is normally obscured from view. Clearly, for aesthetic reasons, the faceplate member should have an attractive appearance.Lock manufacturers are presented with certain problems in massproducing locks of the above nature. Since the outer appearance of the faceplate member is of relevance, these members may have to be discarded if there are surface blemishes. This can be costly where such blemishes are only discovered after a number of processing operations have been completed. Further, the faceplate is frequently provided with through bores for screws by which the lock is attached to the luggage article see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,123,923 to Bako, issuedNovember 7, 1978 and the bores and projecting screw heads may be considered to detract from the overall appearance of the faceplate.Additionally, while basically the same locking mechanism may be suitable for diverse applications, it may be necessary, in order to meet individual customer requirements, to provide locks of different appearance by varying the faceplate design. Disclosure of the inventionIt is an object of the present invention to meet a long felt, and yet unfulfilled need in the industry for a combination lock construction which lends itself to adaption of the faceplate to meet individual customer preferences, while economizing on the number of manufactured items required for adapting the outer appearance of the lock. The present invention is particularly directed toward this end.This object is achieved by providing a fceplate member for an article of luggage hardware such as a combination lock wherein part of the outer surface of said member is covered with a metallic sheet, characterised in that the outer surface of said member has a raised bordering rim, said metallic sheet fits within said rim, and said rim and said sheet have different surface finishes which are selected to complement each other in appearance.In practice, the faceplzte member, with the possible exception of the outer surface, may be electroplated metal and the covering sheets may be of anodized aluminium, dyed in a range of different colors. Thus, a faceplate member may be produced which has a distinctive bi metallic appearance. The selected cover sheet may be adhered to the outer surface of the faceplate member with a metal to metal adhesive.The cover sheets may have cutouts to align with openings in the faceplate member which receive the combination dials, and where the outer surface of the faceplate member has a raised bordering rim, the thickness of the sheet is preferably equal to the height of the rim.For locks which are used in conjunction with a pivotal hasp and which have a manual actuator on the faceplate surface for operating a hasp engaging and disengaging member, the outer surfaces of the hasp and actuator may also be covered with similar covering sheets.Faceplate members made in accordance with the invention have a number of advantageous features.The outer surface of the faceplate1nembeIS need not be finished to the same accuracy as previously, since the surface is covered by a metallic sheet. The faceplate member can, for example, be automatically die cast without the nefd for special finishing.By having in stock cover sheets of different outer appearance, identical faceplate members can be used to produce locks of widely varying appearance, so that a lock manufacturer can use the same model faceplate member to fulfill individual customer preferences as to the surface finish and appearance. Additionally, since the surface of the faceplate member is covered, blemishes need not lead to rejection of the faceplate member and unsightly items, such as screws heads, if used, can be covered.Further, surfaces subject to wear, such as the edge surfaces of a manual actuator where applicable can have a relatively hard metal finish, for example, a chromium plated finish, while the cover sheet can be selected to give the faceplate member as a whole a dominant appearance of a softer metal.In manufacture, if the faceplate member is to be electroplated, the outer surface of the faceplate can be masked during the plating process so as to economize on the plating metal.Additional aspects of the invention will be apparent from the following description and claims taken in conjunction with the attached drawing. Brief description of the drawingThe single figure of the drawing is an exploded perspective view of a combination lock made in accordance with the invention.Mode for carrying out the inventionThe illustrated lock 10 is of the type used in conjunction with a pivotal hasp 12. Lock 10 includes a die cast faceplate member 14 and a casing 16 attached in known manner to the rear of the faceplate member and housing the locking mechanism.The locking mechanism may be of the type disclosed in the aforementioned patent.Only those elements of the lock relevant to the instant invention will be described herein in detail.Faceplate member 14 includes openings for receiving combination dials 18, 20, 22, opening 24 for the hasp and a further opening for a manual actuator 26 which moves a latching member 28 of the lock between hasp engaging and disengaging positions when the lock is on combinatipn. Faceplate member 14 may be cast with depending posts 30, only one of which is shown by,which the lock is attached, for example, to one wall section of a luggage article in known manner.Alternatively, openings may be provided through the faceplate member for attachment screws, rivets or the like.Outer surface 32 of member 14 is cast with a raised bordering rim 34 and rims 36, 38, 40, 42 and 44 surrounding the respective dial openings and the hasp and actuator openings. All of the rims are of substantially equal height.After casting, the faceplate member may be electroplated, for example chromium plated, but the surface 32, except for the raised rims may be left unplated, for example by masking the surface during the plating process.A metal sheet 46 is adhered by any suitable metal to metal adhesive on the upper surface 32 of the faceplate member.It is within the scope of the invention for the outer surface 48 of sheet 46 to be finished so as to provide the same surface appearance to that of the remainder of the faceplate member, or to provide a different appearance so that the lock has a distinctive, bi metallic look. Sheet 46 may, for example, be aluminium and its upper surface 48 may be brushed and may be anodized and dyed any suitable color, so that surface 48 has an appearance which complements the appearance of the remainder of member 14. Sheet 46 may, for example, be chosen from a range of sheets each having a different surface finish for example, the range may include anodized aluminium sheets dyed different colors.The dimensions of sheet 46 may be such that it covers substantially the entire area of surface 32 within the bordering rim 34 and sheet 46 is provided with cutouts, as shown, to receive the respective rims 36, 38, 40, 42 and 44. Preferably, the thickness of sheet 46 is such that when the sheet is secured on surface 32, it has a height substantially equal to the height of the raised rims. Actuator 26 and hasp 12 may also be die cast with raised bordering rims and the upper surfaces of these members may also be provided with metallic covering sheets 50, 52, 54 made from the same material as sheet 46 and adhered to the respective surfaces.Alternatively, different surface finishes may be used for the covering sheets of the hasp and actuator, or the hasp and actuator may be left absent of covering sheets and electroplated over their entire surfaces. If the manual actuator, for example is chromium plated, this has the advantage that its edge surface, which in use is subject to wear by continual manual pressure, has a relatively hard, wear resistant finish, while, by suitable selection of the cover sheets, the dominant appearance of the lock may be that of a softer metal. The covering sheets may for example, have a gold color which provides a distinctive contrast with the chromium plated surfaces.It will be appreciated, that simply by selecting an alternative sheet 46 from an available range, while using the same faceplate member and other lock components, the appearance of the lock can be varied widely. Thus, a lock manufacturer can make up locks of different appearance from the same basic components in order to meet individual customer preferences.While the invention has been described in relation to a lock used in conjunction with a pivoting hasp and which includes a manual actuator for moving a hasp engaging member, the invention is not restricted to this application. and may be used in other forms of combination locks and other articles df luggage hprdware. For example, the invention may be used in a combination lock in which the hasp engages through openings in the side wall of the lock casing and in which a locking member, such as pivotal bolt is moved between locking and unlocking positions simply by manipulating the combination dials. In this case, the faceplate member would only have openings for the dials. The invention may also be used in other luggage hardware articles, such as hasp assemblies per se, manual latch actuator assemblies, and handle mounting studs, for example. Other modifications are also possible within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
