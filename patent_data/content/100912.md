## Description
This invention relates to the use of a specific hot melt adhesive composition as an intermediate adhesive layer in laminating two polymers. The hot melt adhesive composition is based on a certain kind of styrene type hydrocarbon modified polyolefin which exhibits excellent bonding performance when an aromatic polymer is laminated to a polyolefin, and to its use in laminating an aromatic polymer to a polyolefin. Aromatic polymers such as polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate and polyphenylene oxide have been used extensively as food containers, packaging materials, sundries, automotive interior finishing materials, and materials for industrial machinery. In applications which require chemical resistance, water resistance, oil resistance, hot water resistance, heat resistance, heat sealability and gas barrier property, particularly in foodstuff applications, attempts have been made to laminate a polyolefin such as polyethylene or polypropylene to the aromatic polymer in order to impart and or improve these properties. Adhesives having excellent bonding performance have not been developed, and no laminate has been obtained which has excellent adhesive property. For example, when an alpha,beta unsaturated carboxylic acid grafted polyolefin or an epoxy group containing polyolefin, known as an ordinary adhesive polyolefin, is used as an adhesive for laminating a polyolefin to a styrene type polymer, no excellent bonding property can be obtained. Likewise, no excellent bonding property can be obtained when such a modified polyolefin is directly laminated onto a styrene type polymer. With the foregoing background, the present inventors have made extensive investigations in order to develop an adhesive having good adhesive properties which serves as an intermediate adhesive layer in the lamination of an aromatic polymer to a polyolefin, and consequently found that a modified polyolefin with specified properties having a styrene type hydrocarbon graft copolymerized therewith meets the above purpose. According to this invention, there is provided the use of a hot melt adhesive composition comprising a styrene type hydrocarbon modified polyolefin c composed of 100 parts by weight of a crystalline ethylene type polymer a having a degree of crystallinity of 15 to 70 , an intrinsic viscosity η of 0.75 to 3 dl g, a weight average molecular weight The hot melt adhesive composition used according to this invention has excellent adhesion both to polyolefins and aromatic polymers, and serves greatly to supply polyolefin aromatic polymer laminates having excellent chemical resistance, water resistance, hot water resistance, oil resistance, gas barrier property, etc. The hot melt adhesive composition used according to this invention is based on a modified polyolefin obtained by graft copolymerizing a specified polyolefin with a styrene type hydrocarbon. The base polyolefin a constituting the styrene type hydrocarbon grafted modified polyolefin has a degree of crystallinity of 15 to 70 . A polyolefin having a degree of crystallinity of less than 10 tends to give an adhesive composition having low heat resistance. The degree of crystallinity , as used in the present specification and the appended claims, denotes one measured by an X ray diffraction method at 23 C. The base polyolefin a further has an intrinsic viscosity η , measured at 135 C in decalin, of 0.75 to 3 dl g, and a density of 0.84 to 0.96 g cm³. The base polyolefin a should desirably have as narrow a molecular weight distribution as possible. Very desirably, its molecular weight distribution expressed in terms of the ratio of its weight distribution expressed in terms of the ratio of its weight average molecular weight The molecular weight distribution expressed by the ratio of the weight average molecular weight The polyolefins used as the base polyolefin a in this invention are ethylene type polymers including polyethylene, ethylene alpha olefin copolymers with an ethylene content of at least 75 mole such as ethylene propylene copolymer, an ethylene butene 1 copolymer, an ethylene hexene 1 copolymer, an ethylene 4 methyl 1 pentene copolymer, an ethylene hexene 1 copolymer, an ethylene octene 1 copolymer, and an ethylene decene 1 copolymer, and ethylene vinyl monomer copolymers the total vinyl monomer content being not more than 15 mole such as an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, an ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer, an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer, a partially neutralized salt of an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer, an ethylene methyacrylic acid copolymer, a partially neutralized salt of an ethylene methyacrylic acid copolymer, an ethyl acrylate butyl acrylate copolymer, a partially neutralized salt of an ethyl acrylate butyl acrylate copolymer, an ethylene methacrylic acid butyl methacrylate copolymer, a partially neutralized salt of an ethylene methacrylic acid butyl methacrylate copolymer, an ethylene maleic anhydride ethyl acrylate copolymer, and an ethylene maleic anhydride butyl acrylate copolymer. Commercially available ethylene vinyl monomer copolymers obtained by high pressure radical polymerization generally have a molecular weight distribution, Also useful as the base polyolefin used in this invention are grafted products of the aforesaid ethylene alpha olefin copolymers of ethylene vinyl monomer copolymers and at least one unsaturated carboxylic acid the grafted polymers contain not more than 3 mole , preferably not more than 1 mole , more preferably not more than 0.5 mole , of the unsaturated carboxylic acid . The unsaturated carboxylic acid is selected from the group consisting of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, unsaturated dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, allylsuccinic acid, mesaconic acid, glutaconic acid, Nadic acid, methyl Nadic acid, tetraanhydrophthalic acid and methylhexahydrophthalic acid, and unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydrides such as maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, allysuccinic anhydride, glutaconic anhydride, Nadic anhydride, methyl Nadic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride and methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride. These polymers are especially useful when in the production of a laminated article, a polymer having barrier properties, such as a polyamide or an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer, it is used as one layer. The styrene type hydrocarbon b to be grafted to the base polyolefin a described above is styrene or a styrene derivative having 1 to 3, preferably 1 to 2, especially preferably one one, lower alkyl substituent at the vinyl group portion and or the benzene ring portion of styrene. Typical examples are compounds represented by the following general formula where R¹, R² and R³, independently from each other, represent a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group. The term lower as used herein means that a group or a compound qualified by this term has not more than 4, preferably not more than 3, carbon atoms. Thus, the lower alkyl group may be linear or branched, and include, for example, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl and t butyl. Desirably, in formula I , at least one of R¹, R² and R³ is a hydrogen atom, and the remainder are lower alkyl groups. Specific examples of the compounds of formula I include alpha methylstyrene, beta methylstyrene, o methylstyrene, m methylstyrene, p methylstyrene, m ethylstyrene, p ethylstyrene, o isopropylstyrene, m isopropyistyrene and p isopropyistyrene. Of these styrene type hydrocarbons b , styrene, m methylstyrene and p methylstyrene are particularly preferred. The amount of the styrene type hydrocarbon b bound to the base polyolefin a is 0.2 to 5 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the base polyolefin a . The graft copolymerization of the styrene type hydrocarbon b onto the base polyolefin a can be performed by methods know As required, the above graft copolymerization may be carried out in the presence of a radical initiator. Examples of the radical initiators include organic peroxides and organic peresters, such as benzoyl peroxide, dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, di tert butyl peroxide, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di peroxybenzoate hexane 3, 1,4 bis tert butylperoxdisopropyl benzene, lauroyl peroxide, tert butyl peracetate, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di tert butylperoxy hexyne 3, 2,5 di tert butylperoxy hexane, tert butyl perbenzoate, tert butyl perphenylacetate, tert butyl perisobutyrate, tert butylper sec octoate, tert butyl perpivalate, cumyl perpivalate and tert butyl perdiethylacetate and azo compounds such as azobisisobutyronitrile and dimethyl azoisobutyrate. Preferred among these are dialkyl peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide, di tert butyl peroxide, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di tert butylperoxy hexyne 3, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di tert butylperoxy hexane, and 1,4 bis tert butylperoxyisopropyl benzene. The amount of the radical initiator used is not critical. In the case of graft copolymerization in the molten state, the suitable amount of the radical initiator is 0.01 to 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the base polyolefin a , and in the case of graft copolymerization in solution, it is 0.01 to 100 parts by weight. The termperature used in the graft copolymerization varies depending upon the method of graft copolymerization employed. Generally, in the case of graft copolymerization in the molten state, temperatures at which the base polyolefin and the styrene type hydrocarbon are melted, usually about 150 to about 350 C, preferably about 180 to about 320 C, are used. In the case of graft copolymerization in solution, the suitable temperature is generally about 80 to 200 C, preferably 100 to 180 C. In the graft copolymerization, the styrene type hydrocarbon b is used in an amount of 0.20 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the base polyolefin a . The preferred amount is 0.20 to 80 parts by weight, particularly 0.25 to 60 parts by weight. In the heat molten state, the graft copolymerization can be achieved by feeding the polyolefin a , the styrene type hydrocarbon and the radical initiator into an extruder, and maintaining the mixture at the above specified temperature range for about 0.5 to about 10 minutes. Ideally, all the styrene type hydrocarbon charged should be grafted to the base polyolefin in the graft copolymerization. The modified polyolefin c used in this invention may contain some amount of a homopolymer of the styrene type hydrocarbon as a by product. As the content of the homopolymer of the styrene type hydrocarbon increases, the bonding performance of the resulting modified polyolefin a is reduced. Desirably, therefore, the content of such a homopolymer is limited to not more than 200 mole , preferably not more than 180 mole , more preferably not more than 150 mole , based on the amount of the styrene type hydrocarbon bonded to the polyolefin by graft copolymerization. The amount of the styrene type hydrocarbon bonded to the base polyolefin a by graft copolymerization is calculated from the absorption intensity ratio of an aromatic proton and an aliphatic proton based on TMS in H NMR. The styrene type hydrocarbon modified polyolefin c produced as above should have an intrinsic viscosity η , measured as stated hereinabove at 135 C in decalin, of 0.7 to 3 dl g. The modified polyolefin c should have a degree of crystallinity of 10 to 70 . Desirably, the modified polyolefin c has a narrow molecular weight distribution corresponding to the base polyolefin used. Conveniently, the The modified polyolefin c has a density of 0.84 to 0.96 g cm³. In order for the modified polyolefin c to be advantageously used as a hot melt adhesive, it has a melt viscosity at 230 C of 10 to 0.5 x 10⁵ Pa.s. The hot melt adhesive composition may be composed substantially only of the styrene type hydrocarbon grafted polyolefin c . If desired, the adhesive composition may further include various additives such as antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers, antistatic agents, pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, fillers, slip agents, lubricants, fire retardants, and antiblocking agents. Examples of the antioxides are 2,6 di t butyl p cresol, o t butyl p cresol, tetrakis methylene 3 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate methane, beta naphthylamine and p phenylenediamine. Examples of the ultraviolet absorbers are 2,4 dihydroxybenzophenone, 2 2 hydroxy 3 ,5 di t butyl phenyl 5 chlorobenzotriazole. 2 2 hydroxy 3 t butyl 5 methylphenyl 5 chlorobenzotriazole and bis 2,2 ,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidine sebacate. Examples of the antistatic agents are lauryl diethanolamine, palmityl diethanolamine, stearyl diethanolamine, oleyl diethanolamine, benenyl diethanolamine, polyoxyethylene alkylamines, stearyl monoglyceride, and 2 hydroxy 4 n octoxybenzophenone. Examples of colorants including pigments and dyes are carbon black, titanium white, cadmium yellow and copper phthalocyanine blue. Examples of the nucleating agents are aluminium p tert butylbenzoate, dibenzylidene sorbitol and aluminium hydroxy di p t butylbenzoate. Examples of the fillers are glass fibers, carbon fibers, talc, clay, silica, calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide and calcium. Examples of the slip agents are stearamide, oleamide and erucamide. Examples of the lubricants are calcium stearate, zinc stearate, aluminium stearate, magnesium stearate and polyethylene wax. Examples of the fire retardants are antimony oxide, decabromobiphenyl ether, and bis 3,5 dibromo 4 bromopropyloxyphenyl sulfone. An example of the antiblocking agents is silicon dioxide. The amounts of these additives may be selected from suitable amounts which do not adversely affect the objects of this invention. For example based on the total weight of the resins a and b , the suitable amounts are about 0.01 to about 5 be weight for the antioxidants about 0.01 to about 5 by weight for the ultraviolet absorbers about 0.01 to about 1 by weight for the antistatic agents about 0.01 to about 5 by weight for the coloring agents about 0.01 to about 5 by weights for the nucleating agents about 0.1 to about 60 by weight for the fillers about 0.01 to about 1 by weight for the slip agents about 0.01 to about 1 by weight for the lubricants about 0.1 to about 50 by weight for the fire retardants and about 0.01 to about 30 by weight for the antiblocking agents. The hot melt adhesive composition used according to this invention has excellent adhesion to polyolefins, aromatic polymers and chlorine containing polymers. According to another aspect of this invention, there is provided a laminated article composed of at least three layers, i.e., The aromatic polymers , as used herein, denote polymers obtained from vinyl type monomers having an aromatic ring as at least one component by such polymerization reactions as radical polymerization, anionic polymerization, cationic polymerization or Ziegler type polymerization, and polymers obtained from compounds having an aromatic ring as at least one component by polycondensation or addition condensation reaction. Examples of the aromatic polymers are shown below. The chlorine containing polymers denote and include, for example, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinylidene chloride. These polymers may be foamed polymers. These aromatic polymers may be foamed polymers. Preferred among these are general purpose polystyrene, HI polystyrene, AS resin, ABS resin, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate isophthalate, polycyclohexylene dimenthylene terephthalate, polycyclohexylene terephthalate isophthalate, grafted polyphenylene oxide, modified polyphenylene oxide, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, and polyvinylidene chloride. As required, these aromatic polymers and chlorine containing polymers are molded into a desired shape such as a bottle, sheet or film and constitute the aforesaid first and or second polymer layer. The polyolefin constituting the first polymer layer may be the same as those exemplified hereinabove with regard to the base polyolefin used in the production of the hot melt adhesive composition of this invention. It may also be molded into a desired shape such as a bottle, sheet or film, and constitute the first polymer layer. The first and second polymer layers may be laminated through the adhesive composition used in the invention as an interlayer by, for example, a multilayer T die sheet or multilayer film molding method which comprises feeding the component polymers of the respective layers separately into three extruders, and associating the molten polymers at a single die, or by a tandem method in which the molten polymers are heat fused outside the die. The thickness of the adhesive composition used in the invention as an intermediate adhesive layer is not critical, and can be varied widely according to the types of thicknesses of the first and second layer polymers. Usually it may be 1 to 500 µm, preferably 2 to 100 µm. The thickness of the first polymer layer and the thickness of the second polymer layer are neither critical, and can be varied according to the end use of the final laminate. Generally, each of the first and second polymer layers may have a thickness of 5 µm to 50 mm, preferably 8 µm to 40 mm. The laminated article obtained by using the adhesive composition is suitable for use as flexible and rigid packaging materials because of its excellent strength, barrier properties, flavour retaining properties, and secondary processability vacuum moldability, blister moldability . When styrene type hydrocarbon modified polyolefins obtained by using unsaturated carboxylic acid grafted polyolefins as polyolefins a , or blends of the styrene type hydrocarbon modified polyolefins and unsaturated carboxylic acid grafting polyolefins are used in the adhesive layer, a polyamide or an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer can be used as the first or second polymer layer, and this is convenient for some purposes.
