## Description
Title Yeast Copper Metallothionein Gene Field of the Invention This invention relates to cloning of a gene coding for Yeast Copper Metallothionein. Background Information Metallothioneins are low molecular weight, cysteinerich proteins which bind transition metals. They are present in vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and lower eukaryotes and are largely evolutionarily conserved. Metallothioneins, metallo.hicnein like proteins and metallothionein producing microorganisms, can be used to chelate transition metals, such as metals found in industrial waste streams and mining and mineral processing fluids. In addition, they can be used in the treatment of metals poisoning, such as by pissing a subject s plasma throngh columns having a metallothionein bound thereto. Fogel et al., Proc. Natal. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.79 5342 5346 1982 , report isolation and cloning of yeast rDNA fragments that confer copper resistance Cu on otherwise copper sensitive cut cells. Each cloned fragment is composed of tandemly iterated 1.95 kb DNA segments. The smallest fragment found to confer copper resistance is a 1.25 kb Sau3A Sau3A fragment having an XbaI site and a Kp I site. Butt, J. Cell. Biochem., Sup 7A, 147 1983 report construction of a DNA library from copper resistant yeast in YEpl3 and transformation of Cus cells to Cur cells by certain of the plasmids. SUMMARY OF THE INTENTION The invention resides in discovery of a gene from the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can code for YeastCopper Metallothionein Cu Mt , a cysteine and serine rich, metallothionein like protein, and its promoter region. In particular the invention is an isolated structural gene derived from yeast which can code for Cu Mt, and mutants and genetically engineered derivatives thereof. Another aspect of the invention is an isolated gene expression unit comprising the Cu Mt promoter and the isolated structural gene and mutants and genetically engineered derivatives thereof. Another aspect of the invention is an isolated gene promoter region comprising the Yeast Copper Metallothionein promoter s u mutants and geneticaÃy engineered derivatives thereof. Yet another aspect of the invention is recombinantDNA molecules comprising the described DNA fragments, exemplified by plasmids YEpl, YEp2, YRp20, YEp29 and YEp36. DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE Fig. 1 is a restriction endonuclease cleavage map ofYeast DNA fragments carrying a gene expression unit ofCu Mt. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The DNA fragments of the invention are isolatable from copper resistant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as double stranded DNA dsDNA molecules. The invention includes said dsDNA molecules as well as equivalents thereof. Such equivalents include, but are not limited to, single stranded DNA having the same or substantially the same nucleotide sequence as one strand of the dsDNA, messenger RNA mRNA transcripts and DNA and RNA molecules having different codons coding for the same or substantially the same amino acids. By gene expression unit is meant a structural gene and regulatory sequences required for expression of the structural gene. Copper resistant Cur yeast strains resistant to 1.0 mM CuSO4 in synthetic medium can be made from laboratory yeast strains, most of which, if not all, are s copper sensitive Cu sensitive to 0.5 mM CuSO4 in synthetic medium , by growing up such yeast cells in increasing concentrations of CuSO4 and selecting Cur survivors. The DNA fragments of the invention can be isolated from Cur yeast strains by restricting Cu chromosomalDNA and assaying resulting fragments for hybridization toRNA transcripts from Cu strains but not significantly S to RNA transcripts from Cu strains. Alternatively, the fragments can be assayed for hybridization to complementary DNA probes prepared by reverse transcription of mRNA transcripts from Cur and Cus strains. The fragments can be cloned in vectors, including cosmid, plasmid and phage vectors, in yeast and other eukaryotes and in prokaryotes, by known techniques. TheCu Mt structural gene can be expresed from its natural promoter or from a heterologous promoter. Exemplary of vectors useful for cloning the fragments in yeast, and for expressing the structural gene from its natural promoter, are yeast plasmids YEpl3 ATCC 37115 and YRpl7 ATCC 37078 , both of which are widely available. YEpl3 is a pBR322 derivative which carries the 2u plasmid origin of replication and the yeast leucine gene for selection purposes. See Broach et al., Gene 8 121 133 1979 . YRpl7 contains the Trp replicator and the yeast Ura3 gene for selection purposes and the pBR322 origin of replication. Other vectors are, of course, also useful. In particular embodiments, four Sau3A Sau3A fragments of chromosomal DNA from Cu SC 3 strains ura3 trpl his3 gal2 gallO of approximately 1350 bp were cloned intoYEpl3. One other Sau3A fragment was cloned into YRpl7.The four YEpl3 derivatives are identified as YEpl7 YEp2,YEp29 and YEp36 the YRpl7 derivative is identified asYRp20. The YEp36 insert has been partially sequenced as follows 10 20 30 5 GGATCCCATT ACCGACATTT GGGCGCTATA 40 50 60 CGTGCATATG TTCATGTATG TATCTGTATT 70 80 90 TAAAACACTT TTGTATTATT TTTCCTCATA 100 110 120 TATGTGTATA GGTTTATACG GATGATTTAA 130 140 150 TTATTACTTC ACCACCCTTT ATTTCAGGCT 160 170 180 GATATCTTAG CCTTGTTACT AGTTAGAAAA 190 200 210 AGACATTTTT GCTGTCAGTC ACTGTCAAGA 220 230 240 GATTCTTTTG CTGGCATTTC TTCTAGAAGC 250 260 270 AAAAAGAGCG ATGCGTCTTT TCCGCTGAAC 280 290 300 CGTTCCAGCA AAAAAGACTA CCAACGCAAT 310 320 330ATGGATTGTC AGAATCATAT AAAAGAGAAG 340 350 360CAAATAACTC CTTGTCTTGT ATCAATTGCA 370 380 390TTATAATATC TTCTTGTTAG TGCAATATCA 400 410 420TATAGAAGTC ATCGAAATAG ATATTAAGAA 430 440 450 AAACAAACTG TACAATCAAT CAATCAA TCA 460 470 480TCACATAAAA TGTTCAGCGA ATTAATTAAC 490 500 510TTCCAAAATG AAGGTCATGA GTGCCAATGC 520 530 540CAATGTGGTA GCTGCAAAAA TAATGAACAA 550 560 570TGCCAAAAAT CATGTAGCTG TCCAACGGGG 580 590 600TGTAACAGCG ACGACAAATG CCCTTGCGGT 610 620 630AACAAGTCTG AAGAAACCAA GAAGTCATGC 640 650 660 TGCTCTGGGA AATGAAACGA ATAGTCTTTA 670 680 690ATATATTCAT CTAACTATTT GCTGTTTTTA 700 710 720ATTTTTAAAA GGAGAAGGAA GTTTAATCGA 730 740 750CGATTCTACT CAGTTTGAGT ACACTTATGT 760 770 780ATTTTGTTTA GATACTTTGT TAATTTATAG 790 800 810GTATACGTTA ATAATTAAGA AAAGGAAATA 820 830 840 AAGTATCTCC ATATGTCGCC CCAAGAATAA 850 860 870 AATATTATTA GCAAATTCTA GTTTGCCTAA 880 890 900 CTTACAACTC TGTATAGAAT CCCCAGATTT 910 920 930 CGGATAAAAA AAAEAAB AGCTATTCAT 940 GGTACC 3 Based on the sequence, it appears that the GoldbergHogness Box approximately comprises base pairs 361 to 368. The initiation codon begins at base pair 460. The single reading frame codes for a 60 amino acid protein which contains 12 cysteine and 8 serine residues. Results of S1 mapping experiments indicate that transcription initiates at about base pair 401. Based on an estimated size of mature poly A Cu Mt mRNA of about 540 bases, it appears that the 3 end of the Cu Mt sequence is in the region of base pair 835, the poly A tail comprising approximately 100 residues. The tDrmination colon beains at base pair 643. The promoter region appears to begin about 10 bp upstream 51 of a Xbal restriction endonuclease site at bp 232. The inserts in YEp29 and YEp36 appear to be identical but in different orientation. The inserts in YEpl andYEp2 appear to be similar te YEp29 and YEp36 although YEpl and 2 are not cleaved by BamHI. All of the five clones bear close homology in a XbaI KPnI fragment which contains approximately 705 bp. Restriction endonuclease mapping of the YEp36 andYRp20 inserts is shown in Figure 1. Based on the sequence data, above, it appears that the sites in the YEp36 insert are 3 to the following indicated bases BamHI 1 DdeI 157 Sau3A 1 HinfI 211,312 AluI 521, 557 RsaI 431 XbaI 232 KPnI 936 BbvI was also found to cut the insert. These and other restriction sites can be located by the sequence data. For example, the sequence shows BbvI sites 3 to bases 509, 544 and 617. The YRp20 insert is about 2,250 bp. As shown in Fig. 1, it has in common with the YEp36 insert the Sau3A 1 , XbaI, KDnI, Sau3A 1350 and BamHI 1350 restriction sites.The region of the YRp20 insert upstream of the Sau3A 1 site contains a TaqI site about 475 bp upstream of the Sau3A 1 site, a KpnI site about 690 bp upstream 5 of the Sau3A 1 site and a Sau3A site about 905 bp upstream 5 of the Sau3A 1 site. It is to be understood that the above sequence and restriction site data are substantially accurate, that is, actual sequences and restriction sites may differ to the extent that the activity of the molecules or of portions thereof are not materially altered. The upstream regulatory regions, the structural gene, any any other fragment of the Sau3ASau3A inserts an be isolated from yeast chromosomal DNA or other yeast DNA sequence comprising such fragment by known techniques.These include, for example, restricting the yeast DNA upstream and downstream of the fragment and, if necessary, digesting the restriction fragment with a nuclease.Deoxynucleotides can be added or deleted to place the fragment into correct reading frame. A convenient site upstream of the structural gene in the YEp36 insert is the RsaI site at bp 431. Downstream of the structural gene, the KpnI site can be used. Other convenient sites are present and can be identified from the sequence of the insert. By way of further example, in the YEp36 insert, theSau3A KpnI fragment and the DdeI K nI fragment comprise the entire gene expression unit the Sau3A pnI fragment, the XbaI KPnI fragment and the RsaI KpnI fragment all comprise the entire structural gene the Sau3A KpnI fragment, the Sau3A RsaI fragment about 431 bp and theDdeI RsaI fragment about 274 bp all comprise the Cu Mt promoter region. Such and other fragments can be fused to other DNA molecules, such as cloning and expression vectors, to prepare recombinant DNA molecules, by known techniques. Substantially similar fragments can be isolated from the other inserts, although, as noted previously, the YRp20 insert apparently lacks the DdeI 157 site and the YEpl and 29 inserts are not cleaved by BamBI. The Cu Mt structural gene can be expressed from its own or another heterologous promoter region. Cu Mt so produced can be used to extract metal ions from waste streams and mining fluids, including leachates. It can also be used in the treatment of metals poisoning such as by passing a subject s plasma through a Cu Mt containing adsorbent. Such uses can be readily practiced by techniques known in the art. The Cu Mt regulatory region, including the promoter region, can be used to express the Cu Mt or heterologous structural genes. It is advantageous because it is a strong, amplifiable promoter which can be regulated by copper ions. Mutants and genetically engineered derivatives of the various DNA molecules of the invention can be prepared by known techniques including, for example, such conventional techniques as chemical or irradiation mutagenesis as well as recombinant DNA techniques such as altering the DNA sequences by adding, deleting or substituting bases. In the following examples of the invention, which are illustrative, and not limiting, all temperatures are in degrees Celsius. All materials used, including the restriction enzymes, are commercially available and were used as per vendors instructions. The yeast strain, S. cerevisiae SC 3 provided by Dr.William Bergman, University of Maryland, BaltimoreCounty , was grown in synthetic media which contained 0.67 yeast nitrogen base, 2 glucose and appropriate amino acids and pyrimidines, substantially as described bySherman et al., Methods in Yeast Genetics LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York 1981 .Transformations were carried out substantially by the procedure of Tschumper et al., Gene 10 157 166 1980 . EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Cur Strains Yeast cultures were grown in 0.5 mM CuSO4 for several generations in synthetic media. This concentration of CuSO4 is sublethal to the SC 3 strain and 50 of the cells survived. The copper sulfate concentration was increased to 1.0 mM and growth was allowed for several generations. Most of the cells in the culture died at 1.0 mM CuSO4 the survivors 0.196 , which adapted to 1 mM CuSO4, were plated on synthetic medium plates containing 1 mM CuSO4. The Cur strains were maintained in the presence of 1 mM Cuss. Similarly, the Cus strains were selected from the parent culture by replica plating to synthetic medium plates containing C.1 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.3 mM and 0.5 mM CuSO4. The strains whose growth was retarded at 0.2 mM CuSO4 and which did not grow at all above 0.3 mM were selected and s designated as Cu Rapidly growing single colonies were isolated and theCu Mt content of the strains were estimated by 35Scysteine incorporation and subsequent analysis of the protein by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as follows. The appropriate yeast strain was grown in synthetic medium 7 to mid log phase lox10 cells ml in the presence or 35 absence of CuSO4. Prior to addition of 35S cysteine 790 Ci mmol , the cells were washed with distilled water, suspended in fresh media without copper and pulsed for 15 30 min with 35S cysteine 50 uCi 30 ml culture . The cells were centrifuged at 300Cxg for 5 min and pellets were washed with cold distilled water. The pellets were then suspended in 0.25 ml in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube 1 M sorbitol, 10 mM tris HCl pH 8 , 1 mM ethylenediametetraacetate EDTA , 1 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride PMSF and 10 mM mercaptoethanol.Spheroplasts were prepared by adding 20 uL of Zymolyase 60,00G hydroxwlase solution Miles Labobor ator les , Elkhardt, IN 2 mg ml for 45 min at 37O A non ironic detergent, NP 40, was added to a final concentration of 0.4 and the suspension was kept at 4 for 30 min after brief vortexing. The suspension was centrifuged in a microfuge for 5 min. The supernatant was treated with 0.3M iodoacetic acid 1 10 of volume, pH 8 for 45 min and made 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS and 8 M urea by the addition of solid urea crystals. Protein concentrations were estimated by the B Pad dye method.Protein5 were analyzed by 8 M urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described by LeStourgeon et al., Arch. Biochem.Biophys. 155 144 158 1973 , except that SDS was omitted from the gel and the buffer. 100 ug of protein was analyzed per gel slot. The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The gel was fixed with Autoflour National Diagnostics for one hour, dried under vaccuum and autoradiographed. Cur strains produced large s amounts of Cu Mt. Cus strains produced relatively very small amounts. EXM1PLE 2 Isolation and Cloninq of Cu Mt Gene A. Complementary DNA cDNA probes were prepared as follows. Yeast strains, grown in 1.0 mM CuSO4 Cu s and Cus grown in absence of CuSO4 were grown in synthetic media to a density of 2x107 celis ml at 30 . Immediately before harvesting, the cultures were made 100 ug ml in cycloheximide and then transferred to cold, centrifuge bottles and centrifuged at 2000xg for 5 min. Cell pellets were suspended in 7.5 ml liter pellet 8 M guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mM sodium acetate and 1 mM dithiothreitol.All the procedures were performed at 40 in glassware which was rinsed with 0.1 diethyl pyrocarbonate DEPT and baked at 250 overnight. Ten g of glass beads were added to the suspension and the cells were sheared in a Virtis bead beater for three 15 sec pulses. The suspension was filtered and the filtrate was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000xg. Poly A containing RNA was purified from supernatant by the procedure ofChirgirin et al., Biochem. 18 5294 5299 1979 . Poly 32A containing RNA was labelled with P dCTP 7000 Ci mfi.ol by synthesizing cDNA with reverse transcriptase, as described by Wickens et al., J. Biol. Chem.253 2483 2495 1978 . Radioactive cDNA was used as a probe to isolate the copper induceÃa genes of yeast. On average, the specific activity of the probes was 1 x 108 cpm ug poly A RNA. B. Yeast chromosomal DNA fragments were prepared as r follows. Yeast DNA was isolated from Cu SC 3 strains as described by Sherman et al., Cold Spring HarborLaboratory, New York, 1981. Three mg of the DNA were digested to completion with Sau3A 1000 units, 4 hr, 37 . The fragments were fractionated into two sets of 60 fractions by preparative 1 agarose gel electrophoresis. C. Cu Mt containing fragments were isolated and cloned as follows. After electrophoresis, the fractions were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was cut in half to separate the two sets of fractions. 32Each filter was hybridized to a P labelled cDNA probe from the Cur or Cus yeast strains. One fraction, in the range of 1350 bp, which hydridized with the Cur cDNA s but not the Cu DNA was cloned into BamHI sites in YEpl3 and YRpl7. Of approximately 500 clones, eight hybridized with the duplicate nitrocellulose filter. The procedure is described by Maniatis, Molecular Cloning. A LaboratoryManual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York 1982. Five of the eight clones, YEpl, YEp2, YEp29, YEp36 and YRp20, were subsequently confirmed to carry theSau3A fragment containing the Cu Mt gene expression unit by RNA hydridization, restriction mapping and transformation of Cus cells. EXAMPLE 3 Transformation of Cus to Cur Phenotype Copper sensitive yeast strains were transformed withYEpl3, YEp36 and YRp20. The transformants were grown for three days in normal plates and then transferred to plates containing 1 mM CuSO4 and grown for another three days. Cus strains transformed with YEpl3 no DNA insert did not grow at all in 1 Si CUSO4, while the transform.ants of YEp36 and YRp20 grew rapidly in 1 mM CuSO4. Protein analysis of YEp36 transformants grown in the presence of 1 mM CuSO4 indicated that they produced abundant quantities of mRNA which cross hydridized with the DNA insert from YEp36 and also induced expression of large quantities of Cu Mt. EXAMPLE 4 Expression of Heterologous Gene from Cu Mt Promoter Plasmid YEp36 was digested with Sau3A and RsaI to release a 431 bp fragment carrying the Cu Mt promoter region. The Sau3A RsaI fragment was cloned upstream of the GalK structural gene from E. coli in pYSK7 54. The plasmid, pYSK7 54, has BamHI and HpaI sites upstream of the GalK gene, which sites were used for insertion of theCu Mt promoter. The plasmid also has the pBR322 origin of replication for replication in E. coli and the arsl and cen3 regions for replication in yeast. The resultant construct was used to transform a GalK strain of S. cerevisiae. Transformants showed high gaiactokinase activity in the presence of sub lethal amounts of CuSO4. While the preferred embodiments of the invention are fully disclosed by the above, it is two be understood that the invention is not limited to the precise constructions disclosed herein but rather includes all embodiments and modifications coming within the scope of the following claims.
