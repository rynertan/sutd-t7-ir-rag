## Description
DUAL SURFACE MATERIALS According to Plueddemann, in the chapter on silylating agents in Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology , 3rd edition, volume 20, page 962 et seq., silylation is the displacement of active hydrogen from an organic molecule by a silyl group. Plueddemann further states that The active hydrogen is usually OH, NH, or SH, and the silylating agent is usually a trimethylsilyl halide or a nitrogen functional compound. A mixture of silylating agents may be used a mixture of trimethylchlorosilane and hexamethyldisilazane is more reactive than either reagent alone, and the by products combine to form neutral ammonium chloride. Thus, what Plueddemann has described is what those skilled in the art regard as the normal way to silylate organic molecules using reactive silanes. It has been beneficial to industry to have this approach available to alter organic molecules to achieve certain new molecules. See, for example, Poole, C. F.,Recent Advances in Silylation of Organic Compounds for GasChromatography, Chapter 4, Handbook of Derivatives forChromatography , K. Blau and G. King, Heyden, London, 1977, pages 152 200. Those skilled in the art have extrapolated silylation of organic molecules to silylation of inorganic molecules and materials as well.For example, it is known that silicas, used as fillers for compounded rubbers, could be treated with reactive silanes such trimethylchloro silane and or hexamethyldisilazane to.place trimethylsilyl groups on the surface of such silicas This treatment arises through the reaction of the hydroxls on the silica with the reactive silanes. See, for example, Hertl, W. and Hair,M.L., Reaction of Hexamethyldisilazane with Silica , J. of Phys. Chem., Voluine 75, No. 14, 1971 and Chmiaoweic, J. andMarrow, B.A., ZAlkylation of Silica Surfaces , J. of Coll.and Inter. Sci., Volume 94, No. 2, August 1983 and Boksanyi,L., Liardon, 0. and Kovats, E., Advances in Coll. and Inter.Sci., 6 1976 , pages 95 to 137. Porous support materials used in liquid or thin layer chromatography applications also benefit by silylation techniques. Such materials have a very large surface area within their porous interior, so that the exterior surface accounts for less than one percent of the total surface area.Such materials can be in either particulate or nonparticulate forms e. g., coatings . It is common in this art to use reactive silanes to treat such materials to remove accessible reactive hydroxyl groups on the entire surface including that of the porous interior to improve the chromatographic properties of polar molecules. See, for example, 1. R. Snyder and J. J. Kirkland, Introduction toModern Liquid Chromatography, 2nd edition, Wiley Tnterscience, N.Y. 1979. A more significant advance in the silylation art came about by the use of reactive silanes which also contained organofunctional groups to silylate surfaces. The desired result was to create a material having a novel end use which was dependent on the type of organofunctional group included in the silylating silane. For example, inU.S. Patent No. 4,379,931, issued on April 12, 1983,Plueddemann used unique reactive silanes, for exampleEMI2.1 to treat various particulate materials which were then used to extract metal ions from solution. For most of the practical applications known in the prior art, the preferred mode of silylation is that which is carried out in solution. There are, however, some silylation applications wherein the silylation reaction is carried out from the vapor phase. It can be concluded, therefore, that it is generally known in the art to use various reactive silanes to react with hydroxyls on the surfaces of various materials. What is disclosed in this invention is the use of stable but rapidly reacting silanes to react with the hydroxyls on the exterior surfaces of porous materials, and then the use of a second reactive silane to react with the hydroxyls on the porous interior surface of the porous material to provide a dual surface material in the sense that the silicon containing groups attached to the exterior surface are different than the silicon containing groups on the surface of the porous interior of the material. Further, it is contemplated that the silicon containing groups covalently bonded to the exterior surface of the porous material will be predominantly those obtained from the rapidly reacting silane while the silicon containing groups covalently bonded to the interior surface of the porous material will be predominantly those obtained from the second reactive silane. It is believed by the inventors herein that. such dual surface materials are unique, having never been disclosed anywhere in the published literature. Such dual surface materials may be prepared by selecting dual groups that independently adjust transport properties to, and chemical activities of, the dual surface materials. Thus, it is an object of this invention to provide a method for preparing a composition having a dual surface, the method comprising I contacting a hydroxyl bearing porous material with less than a stoichiometric equivalent, based on the hydroxyl content of the porous material, of a rapidly reacting silane II allowing the mixture from I to react and form covalent bonds by reaction with the exterior surface hydroxyl groups thereby treating the porous material exterior surface . III thereafter, contacting and mixing the treated porous material from 11 with a reactive silane, different than the silane of steps I and II , for a period of time to allow the reactive silane, or its silanol bearing hydrolysis product, to diffuse into the interior of the porous material and covalently bond by reaction with hydroxyl groups on the interior surface of the porous material, and IV subsequently isolating the dual surface porous material from the mixture of III . It is a further object of this invention to provide a composition of matter consisting of a porous material having covalently bonded to its exterior surface, nonsilanol containing silicon groups and having covalently bonded to the surface of its porous interior, siliconcontaining groups which are different from those bonded to the exterior surface. Thus, the ultimate goal of this invention is to provide a method which will give a composition that has a dual surface. What is meant by dual surface for purposes of this invention is that the silicon containing groups covalently bonded by a siloxy bond to the exterior surface of the porous material are different in nature than the silicon containing groups covalently bonded by siloxy bonds to the porous interior surface of the porous materials. This goal can be achieved by first reacting the porous material with a small amount of a stable, rapidly reacting silane to treat the exterior surface of the porous material with little or no diffusion of the silane in its rapidly reacting form into the pores and therefore, little or no treatment within the pores by the rapidly reacting silane, and then, reacting the so treated porous material with an excess of a second reactive silane different from the first silane, and allowing the reactive silane, or its silanol bearing hydrolysis product, to diffuse into the pores and covalently bond to the interior surface. This invention differs from another approach, in that, in a co pending application entitled Porous MaterialsHaving a Dual Surface , filed on even date herewith, the inventors prepared dual surface porous materials by using an unstable, highly reactive silane intermediate in the first step of the method as opposed to the use of a stable, rapidly reacting silane used in the first step of this inventive method. There is one major factor that allows the inventive method to produce the inventive compositions herein. The rapidly reacting silanes are chosen so that they react very rapidly with the exterior surface hydroxyls of the porous materials, and therefore, their physical entry into the pores is severely limited while the exterior hydroxyls are being treated. In this inventive method then, the first phase of the process requires two steps. The first step, i.e. step I , requires contacting a porous material with a rapidly reacting silane, and step 11 requires allowing the rapidly reacting silane to react with the porous material to obtain a treated porous material. It should be obvious from the discussion above to those skilled in the art that steps I and II can occur virtually simultaneously. Step III is then carried out by contacting the treated porous material with a second reactive silane, or its silanol bearing hydrolysis product, and allowing the reactive silane, or its hydrolysis product, to diffuse into the pores and react with the hydroxyls therein. Subsequently, the desired end product is isolated from the reaction mixture by some means. For purposes of this invention, in steps I and it , the rapidly reacting silanes are selected from those that are known in the art to react very rapidly with hydroxyl groups. Such silanes are those whose rate of reaction, with surface hydroxyls of hydroxylated porous materials, is fast enough that the silanes do not have time to significantly diffuse into the porous interior of the porous material.Thus, factors which influence the selection of the silanes that are useful in the first steps of the inventive method are the leaving groups, which should be selected from those which generally display a rapid rate of reaction with hydroxyl groupsr the type of substitution on the silane such that the leaving groups on the silane are compatible, i.e.non reactive, with any organofunctional group on the silane molecule so that the highly reactive silane is stable in the absence of hydroxyl groups the properties that one desires from the permanent groups that are left on the silane molecule after covalent attachment to the exterior surface and the combination of groups substituted on silicon such that steric hinderance will not too severely slow the rate of reaction with the exterior.hydroxyl groups. The rapidly reacting silanes useful in the first step of this invention are those silanes selected from a group consisting of i disubstituted amides wherein the amides are selected from a group consisting of a N,N disubstituted amides having the general formulaEMI6.1 and b N,O disubstituted amides having the general formulaEMI7.1 wherein in said formulae, R is selected from hydrogen, allyl , vinyl and Q wherein Q is selected from a group consisting of a alkyl groups having less than twenty carbon atoms, b aryl groups having less than twenty carbon atoms, c CH2 2CF3, d CH2 3Cl, iv e CH2 3SR iv f CH2 3NR2 g CH2 3N R CH2 2N RiV 2, EMI7.2 j CH2 3OC O C CH3 CH2 CH2 EMI7.3 wherein R is independently selected from methyl, ethyl and phenyl groups R is selected from methyl, ethyl and phenyl groups R is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group of from 1 to 6 carbon iv atoms or hydrogen R is selected from methyl, ethyl and phenyl groups a b has a value of 3 and neither a nor b has a value of zero ii substituted amines wherein the amines are selected from a group consisting of a N,N,N trisubstituted amines having the general formula RV Rvi CSi NR 2 d and b heterocyclic amines, wherein the heterocyclic amines are selected from the group consistingEMI8.1 wherein in said formulae Rv and RViii are each independently selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, allyl, vinyl and Q wherein O is selected from a group consisting of a alkyl groups having less than twenty carbon atoms, b aryl groups having less than twenty carbon atoms, c CH2 2CF3, ix d CH2 3SR ix, e cH2 3NR2 ix ix f CR2 3N R CH2 2N R 2 EMI8.2 i CH2 30C O C CH3 CH2 andEMI8.3 wherein RVi is independently selected from methyl, ethyl and phenyl groups Rvii is independently selected from methyl, ethyl and phenyl groups Rix is independently selected from alkyl groups of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and phenyl groups c d has a value of 3 and neither c nor d has a value of zero and iii thioethers selected from the group consisting of a thioethers having the general formula RXR2xiSiSR and b thioethers having the general formula RXR2xlSi 2S wherein in said formulae, Rx is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen, allyl, vinyl and Q wherein Q is selected from a group consisting of a alkyl groups having less than twenty carbon atoms, b aryl groups having less than twenty carbon atoms, c CH2 2CF3, a CH2 3SRXiii d CH2 3SR e CH2 3NR2xiii, xiii CH2 3N Rxiii CH2 2N Rxiii 2 xiii f CH2 3N R CH2 2N R EMI9.1 i CH2 30C O C CH3 CH2 CH2 EMI9.2 wherein Rxi is independently selected from methyl, ethyl and phenyl groups Rxii and Rxiii are each independently selected from alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms and phenyl. The porous materials found useful in this invention are those materials which are porous solids having hydroxyl groups on their surfaces. Such materials for example are silica, silica gel, alumina, stannia, titania, zirconia, and the like. Also, these materials can be porous glass, porous ceramic or plastic as long as the material has, or will form, hydroxyl groups on its surface. The form of the porous material is not overly critical. Particulate porous materials, as well as filaments, slabs, discs, blocks, spheres, films and other such forms can be used in this invention Also contemplated within the scope of this invention is the treatment of particulate materials by the process of this invention, and the subsequent forming of the treated particulate materials into slabs, discs, blocks, spheres, films, membranes, sheets, and the like. Preferred for this invention are the porous metalloid and metallic oxides such as silica, alumina, stannia and titania in all of their related forms. Most preferred are the silicas. Also contemplated within the scope of this invention are porous mixed metallic oxides such as Na20 Alp03 5SiO2 nH20, wherein n is the moles of water of hydration, and the like. Preferred for this invention is the method whereby the rapidly reacting silane is gradually added to a rapidly stirred solvent which is in direct contact with the porous material. The rapidly reacting silane makes immediate contact with the porous material and decreases the chances of non uniform use of the reactive silane intermediate. Also contemplated within the scope of this invention is the method wherein steps I and II are carried out in the vapor phase by causing the vapors of the reactive silane to contact and react with the porous material. For example, the porous material is placed in a vacuum reactor and dried under vacuum. The rapidly reacting silane is then allowed to enter the vacuum chamber as a vapor and contact the porous material and after a certain contact time, the byproducts of the reactions are removed by vacuum, the vacuum is released, and the porous material removed from the chamber. As steps I and II are carried out, it is preferred that the stoichiometry of the reaction between the rapidly reacting silane and the surface hydroxyls is a starved stoichiometry, in the sense that there is used much less rapidly reacting silane than would be necessary to react with all of the hydroxyls available on the entire surface of the porous material.Thus, by using this starved stoichiometry, one enhances the chances that all of the exterior surface hydroxyls that are accessible will be reacted with the rapidly reacting silane but the porous interior hydroxyls will not, owing to the fact that there simply is not enough rapidly reacting silane to react with all of the hydroxyls of the porous material, and not all of the surface hydroxyls are available for reaction since once the surface hydroxyls are contacted by the silane and reacted with them, the effects of steric hinderance start to reduce the number of surface hydroxyls that are accessible by the silane.Thus, it is obvious that the material resulting from steps I and II has little or no reactant on the interior surface hydroxyls and therefore, when the treated product from steps I and II is subjected to step III of this inventive process, the moiety resulting from the second reactive silane will be found on the interior surfaces of the pores, resulting in a purer dual surface material. Steps I and II can be carried out in a period of time of from 1 minute to 24 hours. Generally, for purposes of this invention, it is preferred to carry out steps tI and Il over about a 30 minute to 6 hour time period to ensure that the exterior surface of the porous material is uniformly treated. The temperature at which steps I and II are carried out is not narrowly critical and can range from OOC to 400 C. Preferred is a room temperature to 2000C reaction mixture temperature. The amount of rapidly reacting silane useful in this invention depends on the number of exterior surface hydroxyls to be reacted. Typically, a stoichiometric equivalent to the exterior surface hydroxyls plus some excess of the rapidly reacting silane is required to treat the surface hydroxyls because of the potential side reactions involved. Typically, 50 to 1000 excess is used. This excess is with respect to the exterior hydroxyl groups. With respect to the total hydroxyls on both the exterior and interior surfaces, the amount of the rapidly reacting silane usually amounts to about .001 to 1 . If it is desirable to achieve a somewhat thicker exterior surface treatment, then obviously, somewhat more rapidly reacting silane should be used. Silanes such as N l,l,l trifluoropropyldimethyl silyl N methylacetamide can be used to provide a hydrophobic environment for the exterior surface. N vinyldimethyl silyl N methylacetamide is an excellent silane to use in this invention because it leaves the vinyldimethylsilyl group on the exterior surface of the porous material. The vinyl group is valuable because once the vinyl group is attached to the surface of the porous material, conventional organic reactions can be used to add to the vinyl group thus creating yet another type of group on the surface of the porous material.For example, when the porous material is treated with N vinyldimethylsilyl N methylacetamide, one can add HSCH2COOH to the resulting vinyl dimethyl silyl to give a surface group such as HOOCCH2S CH2 2 CH3 2SiOSi . Using bis dimethylsilyl N methylacetamide gives a surface treatment such as H CH3 2SiOSi which can also be further reacted with unsaturated molecules to provide further modifications to the surface of the porous material through silicon hydride addition to unsaturated compounds. In the second phase of the method, i.e. step III , the material obtained by steps I and II is contacted with a reactive silane. It should be noted that steps I and II deal with a rapidly reacting silane n while step III deals with a reactive silane . For purposes of this invention, what is meant by reactive silane is that the silane will react with the surface hydroxyls. This reaction is preferably carried out in bulk solution as the reactive silanes are often neither reactive enough nor volatile enough to use as vapors. Thus, the reactants are mixed together in a solvent solution, with or without, heating. The object of step III is to permit the diffusion of the reactive silane into the pores of the porous material and to allow reaction of this silane with the hydroxyl groups that are covalently bonded to the interior surface. In many instances, it is actually the silanol bearing hydrolysis product of the reactive silane which reacts with the interior surface hydroxyl groups. Such hydrolysis products form from adsorbed water in the porous material. Since the accessible exterior surface hydroxyls of the porous material have been effectively removed by the rapidly reacting silane in steps I and it , the reactive silane does not have available to it accessible reactive sites on the exterior surface of the porous material. Thus, the reactive silane has only the hydroxyls remaining on the interior surfaces of the porous material available for reaction. Therefore, step III must be carried out for a sufficient period of time to allow for the diffusion of the reactive silane into the pores and reaction of the silanes with the interior hydroxyl groups therein or hydrolysis of the silane and then diffusion of the hydrolyzate into the pore to react . Some of the more highly reactive silanes do not require hydrolysis prior to reaction with the interior hydroxyl groups and may also be used as vapors. Step III can be carried out for a period of time of from several minutes to several hours. As indicated above, this phase of the process depends on the rate of hydrolysis of the reactive silane and the rate of diffusion of the silane, or its hydrolysis product, into the pores of the porous material. Preferred for this invention is a reaction time for step III of from 10 minutes to 24 hours.Most preferred is a time of 1 to 6 hours. The temperature at which step III is carried out is more critical than steps I and II , yet it is not narrowly critical. As one would expect, increased temperatures enhance the rate of reaction. Increasing the temperature does not appear to promote too many undesirable side reactions. Thus, the temperature used in step III can range from 0 C to 3000C. Most preferred is the reflux temperature of the reaction at about 700C to 1200C. The amount of reactive silane useful in this invention depends on how many of the surface hydroxyls of the pore interior one wishes to treat. An excess of the reactive silane may be used as this reactive silane does not displace any of the exterior surface groups obtained by steps I and II . Typically, a stoichiometric quantity, based on reactive hydroxyls of the pore surfaces, is used in step herein. If the reactive silane is very sluggish e.g., organosilanol , then the reaction should be catalyzed with acid or base, with the proviso that the minimum catalysis required for completion of the reaction be used. The time and temperature of such catalyzed silylations must be carefully adjusted by trial and error to attain adequate interior coverage before the displacement of the covalently bound external group begins. The reactive silanes useful in step III of this invention are those kinds of silanes which are recognized as conventional silylation reagents. Thus, the silanes that are defined as useful in steps I and II of this invention are also useful in this step of the invention as long as the silanes are chosen such that the silane used in steps I and II is not the same as the silane chosen in step III and vice versa. Other useful silanes are the common silanes such as those having the general formula RXV4 Sixe wherein Rxv is independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, phenyl, vinyl and allyl X is a hydrolyzable radical selected from chlorine, alkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, acetoxy, amine and amido radicals and e has a value of 1, 2 or 3. Such silanes and the processeS for their manufacture are known in the art and it does not appear that such processes need be set forth in detail herein. Specific silanes which are useful herein include trimethylchlorosilane dimethyldichlorosilane hexamethyldisilazane N,N bis trimethylsilyl urea N trimethylsilyldiethylamine N trimethylsilylimidazole N,O bis trimethylsilyl acetamide N,O bis trimethylsilyl tri fluoroacetamideli N methyl N trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide t butyldimethylsilylimidazole N trimethylsilylacetamide N trimethylsilylpiperidine hexamethyldisilthiane O trimethylsilylacetate O trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetate N trimethylsilyldimethylamine N trimethylsilylmorpholine N trimethylsilylpyrrolidine and N trimethylsilylacetanilide. Yet another aspect of this invention is the use in step III of organofunctional silanes to silylate the porous material. Such silanes useful in this invention include, for example, alpha methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane 4 aminopropylitriethoxysilane gamma beta aminoethyl amino propyl trimethoxysilane gamma glycidoxypropyl3tri methoxysilane beta 3, 4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxy silane beta mercaptoethyl trimethoxysilane gamma mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane gamma chloropropylitrimethoxysilane CH2 CHC6H4CH2NR CH2 2NHeoCH3 HCl CR3O 3Si CR2 3N CR3 2C18H37Cl CH3 3Si C112 3N CH3 2C12R25Cl e CH3O 3Si CR2 3NCH3 C12H25 EMI16.1 CH3O 3Si CH2 9CR3 CH3O 3Si CH2 19CH3 and the like.These silanes will impart a variety of useful chemical properties to the porous interior surface which can be usefully combined with valuable transport properties of the exterior surface groups. For example, the exterior groups may enhance the ion selectivity of chelating groups covalently bonded to the interior surface. When it is determined that the reaction in step III is essentially finished, the product is typically isolated from the reaction mixture. Thus, step IV of this process is the isolation of such products from the reaction mixture. This can be accomplished in a number of ways. For example, the liquid can be decanted, the porous material washed and the liquid decanted, successively, or the reaction mixture can be filtered to remove the liquid from the solid product. The final product can be used in this form or it can be dried. If the final product is other than particulate in form, it can be used as is or it can be further shaped and formed without losing beneficial properties. If the material is in a particulate form it can be used as is or it can be compressed, sintered, or otherwise formed. It is also contemplated within the scope of this invention to prepare a dual surface porous material by eliminating step III of the defined process. The elimination of step III of the process results in an intermediate product wherein the surface of the porous material is first treated by steps I and II to provide a treated porous material having nonsilanol containing silicon groups on the exterior surface and hydroxyl groups on the porous interior surface. Thus, this invention also consists of a method of preparing a dual surface porous material which comprises A contacting a hydroxyl bearing porous material with less than a stoichiometric equivalent, based on the hydroxyl content of the porous material, of a rapidly reacting silane B allowing the mixture from A to react and form covalent bonds by reaction with the exterior surface hydroxyl groups thereby treating the porous material exterior surface C subsequently isolating the dual surface porous material from the mixture B . Also included within the scope of this invention are the compositions which are intermediates. These compositions consist of a porous material having reacted to its exterior surface, nonsilanol containing silicon groups, and whose porous interior surface contains hydroxyls. These intermediates are useful products for the method disclosed supra for providing dual surface materials using reactive silanes to treat the interior pore surfaces. The dual surface porous materials of this invention are useful for chelating metals from solution, among other things. The materials, whose surfaces are capable of further modification, such as H CH3 2SiO and CH2 CH CH3 2SiO are useful intermediates in the preparation of other surfacemodified porous materials. Now, so that those skilled in the art mayappreciate and understand the invention described herein, the following examples are offered for illustration purposes only. The examples should not be construed as limiting the invention as defined in the claims.Example 1 Porous silica gel discs were prepared by pressing 0.5 gms of silica gel obtained from J. T. Baker Co.,Phillipsburg, N.J., U.S.A. 83405 1 chromatographic beads, 2 60 200 mesh, 60 angstrom units pore diameter, 300 m gm in a 1 1 4 inch die for 30 seconds at 30,000 psi. The discs were broken in half and cleaned by heating in a Lindberg Box furnace for 4 hours at 5000C. The disc halves were then stored for a minimum of 24 hours in a moist carbostat to rehydroxylate the surface while retaining the cleanliness of the disc half. The carbostat is an aluminum dessicator containing aluminum shot. Its cleanliness had been assured by regenerating the shot at 5000C for four hours in theLindberg furnace prior to use.Rehydroxylation conditions were attained by placing a pan of distilled water in the carbostat. For the silylation reaction of step I and step II , 1,1, 1 trifluoropropyldimethyisilyl N methylacetamide was used. Two halves of the cleaned and rehydroxylated discs weighing 0.25 gms each were placed in an ultrahigh vacuum reactor designed and built by the inventors herein. The need for ultrahigh vacuum can be appreciated by considering that at a pressure 10 6 torr, an otherwise clean surface can be covered by a monolayer of residual gas molecules, mostly water and hydrocarbons, in about two seconds. In the case of partially dehydroxylated silica, this leads to uncontrolled rehydroxylation prior to silylation, as well as, interference by the chemisorbed organics.This is not a critical factor in the silylation reactions on the porous material in a commercialization mode, but this is a fairly critical factor in attempting to establish what affect the silylation reactions have on the porous material for the purpose of establishing that the invention herein is operative. The half discs were dried at 2000C for 2 hours under vacuum, and then the reactor was cooled to room temperature and the source of the vacuum was shut off and the vaporous silane indicated above was allowed to enter the chamber containing the half discs for 8 seconds. This time of exposure was calculated based on the approximate number of hydroxyls on the exterior surface of the discs to provide exterior treatment but little or no interior pore treatment.After 8 seconds of flow time, the silane flow was shut off and the silane was allowed to react with the hydroxyls of the discs for a period of 30 minutes. The system was then evacuated overnight about 16 hours to a pressure of 10 torr. The half discs were then exposed to a second reactive silane, trimethylsilyl N methylacetamide, by introducing the Vaporous silane into the chamber for a period of thirty seconds. The silane and porous material were allowed to contact and react for 30 minutes. No pressure drop occurred after shutting off the flow of silane, suggesting that saturation of the silica discs had occurred.After a two hour evacuation to remove excess reagent and the unreacted silane, the two half discs were removed. One half disc was ground in an alumina mortar and pestle and analyzed for bulk carbon and fluorine, while the other half disc was analyzed using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis ESCA . The carbon to silicon and fluorine to silicon atomic ratios measured by ESCA were corrected for carbon blank and for thin layer effects on the measured composition.ESCA detects about the first 50 angstrom units of thickness of material and thus it essentially detects only the exterior treatment in as much as the silica gel used in this example had a pore diameter of about 60 angstrom units The corrected carbon to silicon and fluorine to silicon ratios were then used to infer the mole percents of CF3CH2CH2 CH3 2Si and CH3 3Si on the exterior surface of the silica gel. The mole percents were determined for the interior surface by the use of the bulk weight percent carbon and fluorine in the usual manner and correcting for the amounts detected in a similar but untreated silica gel disc. Bulk analysis is appropriate for such characterization because the interior surface accounts for more than 99 of the total surface area in porous materials. The analysis showed that the silica gel had been treated 100 with CF3CH2CH2 CH3 2Si on the exterior surface and 97 CH3 3Si treatment on its interior pores.Example 2 When the steps in example 1 were essentially repeated but the exterior surface was treated with trimethylsilyl N methylacetamide and the interior surface was treated with l,l,l trif luoropropyldimethylsi lyl N methyl acetamide, the result was that the surface was treated to 90 with CH3 3Si groups and the interior surface was treated with 34 of CF3CH2CH2 CH3 2Si groups.
