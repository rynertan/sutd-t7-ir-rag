# Isocyanato terminated polysulfide polymers and processes for their preparation.

## Abstract
Fully and partially arylamine terminated polysulfide polymers and processes for their preparation and use are disclosed. The fully arylamine terminated products are cur able with polyisocyanates to high molecular weight polymers which are useful in molding and casting as well as in sealants. The partially arylamine terminated polymers may be further reacted with polyisocyanates to form thiol terminated polysulfide polymers containing urea chain segments. These compounds are curable in the same manner as standard polysulfide polymers to form firmer polymers. The partially arylamine terminated polymers may also be chain extended using isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymers. These block copolymers may be cured by standard SH terminated polysulfide polymer curing methods to prepare sealants of exceptional resiliency and weather resistance.
