# Low profile prosthetic xenograft heart valve.

## Abstract
Prosthetic heart valves having a low profile are disclosed which comprise an annular, right cylindrical, metal stent covered with fabric around which a glutaraldehyde stabilized pericardial valving element is attached. The valving element is formed of three leaflets, each having a plateau on a truncated triangle extending higher at the center than at the edges, and formed as a cylinder having a diameter substan tially equal to the diameter of the stent. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the stent has upright legs which have radiused upper tips which are approximately one half the width of prior art stent legs. These narrow tipped stent legs reduce stress induced in the leaflets by curvature of the leaflets around the tips of the stent legs in the closed position, extending the service life of the valve. Tabs are added to the tips of the stent legs to add structural strength. These tabs can be tapered or straight but their bottom portions must be narrower than the stent legs. The tabs have a plurality of holes in them through which coaptation stitches are passed. The coaptation stitch can be two separate stitches, one in a first plane and one in a second plane at 90 to the first plane, or, in the preferred embodi ment, a single figure eight stitch passing through the holes in the tab in a plane coincident with the long axis of the stent leg.
