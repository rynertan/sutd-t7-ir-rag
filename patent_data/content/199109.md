## Description
This invention relates to MESFETs Metal Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors in pull up and pull down configuration where a diode is used to bootstrap the gate to source voltage. MISFET Metal Insulated Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor bootstrap circuits using capacitors to increase gate to source voltage are known. For example, in US A 3 898 479 a bootstrap capacitor is used to increase the gate voltage of an active load MISFET to a value in excess of the drain voltage. This allows rapid switching of the transistor. Similar circuits are found in US A 3,774,055 and 4,443,720. The insulating layer between the gate and substrate allows large bootstrap voltages to be used with MOSFETs because no current can flow into the channel from the gate. Current injected through the gate in a FET would have a substantial detrimental impact on circuits incorporating the MOSFET since it would cause a voltage drop on the source resistance and therefore decrease the device current. This would alter the expected MOSFET I V characteristics. In a MESFET, the absence of the insulating layer requires that great care is taken in designing a bootstrap circuit with a capacitor. Further, capacitors take up inordinately large chip area and are relatively difficult to process. Active load MESFETs have not been provided with bootstrap capacitors. Instead, the gate and source have simply been shorted See Figure 1 . An active load bootstrap MESFET which does not employ a capacitor and is otherwise area conservative, would be a highly desirable component which could enhance logic circuit performance. This object is achieved by the invention as characterized in claim 1. The invention is a bootstrap MESFET including a conductive path between drain and gate, and a diode connected between the gate and source wherein the diode is slightly forward biased allowing current to flow only toward the source. The diode increases the gate to source voltage thus increasing the drain current and enhancing the drive capability of circuits employing the bootstrap MESFETs as an active pull up or pull down device. Further details and improvements of the invention are described in the subclaims. Additional diodes may be placed in series along the conductive path, with the diodes slightly forward biased to allow current to only flow along the conductive path toward the source. The diodes are preferably Schottky diodes. The MESFET is preferably a depletion mode device with a gallium arsenide substrate. Methods of enhancing MESFET logic families corresponding to the operation of the above bootstrap MESFET are also disclosed. Circuit 10 of Figure 2 depicts the first embodiment of the present invention. A MESFET 12 includes drain region 14, source region 16, gate 18, conductive path 20 extending between drain 14 and gate 18 and bootstrap diode 22 connected between gate 18 and source 16 with the forward current direction of diode 22 being towards source 16. Circuit 10 also typically includes an output node 24. Placing diode 22 as shown in Figure 2 eases circuit design requirements. If diode 22 were reversed, voltage V The relationship of the saturation drain current I For N channel depletion mode operation i.e.,normally on MESFET the gate threshold voltage V This increased current will enhance the drive capabilities of MESFET logic circuits employing circuit 10. The present invention may further include one or more additional diodes connected in series along conductive path 20. The additional diodes should allow substantial current to only flow from the drain region 14 to the source region 16. All diodes along conductive path 20 should be slightly forward biased, i.e., forward biased but biased to less than the barrier voltage of the diodes. See the discussion below regarding equation 4 for further information regarding biasing the diodes. Circuit 26 of figure 3 displays one additional diode 28. Figure 3 also superimposes two diodes 30 and 32 in series between drain 14 and source 16. Diodes 30 and 32 represent equivalent circuit models of the gate drain and gate source junctions, respectively, of MESFET 12. Note that diode 30 is always reversed biased and no current will be injected in the channel region 34 see Figure 6 through diode 30. Diode 32, however, can become forward biased under certain conditions. If diode 32 is forward biased current could be injected into channel 34 through gate 18, which, as discussed above, will substantially alter the I V characteristics of MESFET 12. In order to preserve the general shape of the I V characteristics of MESFET 12, diode 32 should not conduct substantial current and is preferably reverse biased. A convenient method of insuring that diode 32 will not conduct substantial current is to choose MESFET 12 so that the turn on voltage V Further, in order for MESFET 12 to function as an an active load without currents from the voltage source V In particular, the maximum voltage between drain 14 and source 16 must be greater than or equal to the sum of the turn on voltages for the diodes along conductive path 20 and the bootstrap diodes. That is V In figure 3, i 2 however, i can be virtually any number. Typically i will be four or less. As V Generally all diodes such as 22 and 28 will be the same, however, equation 4 could be satisfied with such diodes being different. In selecting diodes for the bypass conductive path one is still constrained by the preferred relationship of the barrier voltages of diodes 22 and 32. Thus the area of diode 22 should be several times larger than area of diode 32. Thus the area of diode 22 should be several times larger than area of diode 32. Figures 4a, 4b, 5, 6 and 7 show plan views of a convenient integrated circuit incorporating the circuit of Figure 3 and three different cross sectional views. Corresponding structures between Figures 4 and 4b, and Figure 3 are like numbered. Schottky metal 3b can be, for example, TiW Si Figure 8 shows a DCFL i.e. direct coupled FET logic NOR gate with bootstrap diode 50 and additional diode 52. MESFET 54 serves as an active load with MESFET 56 serving as a switch. The ouput is taken at node 58. Figure 9a shows the performance of the circuit of Figure 8 with the standard active load of Figure 1 substituted for the bootstrap active load shown in Figure 8. Figure 9a depicts an input voltage 60 applied to the gate of MESFET 56 and the output voltage 62 at node 58 of the next gate in the chain. At the .45 midrange of the vertical axis the response time is just over 1 nanosecond. In Figure 9b the performance of the circuit Figure 8 with bootstrap is shown and the response time at the midrange of .45 of input voltage 60 compared to output voltage 62 is substantially less than 1 nanosecond. The time shift between signal 60 and 62 is equal to two gate delays. In fact a gate delay improvement of approximately 14 was observed. The following is a list of parameters used in generating the data shown in Figures 9a and 9b Figure 10 shows a Schottky diode FET logic SDFL NOR gate with bootstrap. Similar components between Figures 8 and 10 are like numbered. MESFET 64 serves as a current source. Figures 11a and 11b show a comparison similar to that made in Figures 9a and 9b between an SDFL NOR gate with and without, respectively, bootstrap. Input and ouput voltages are again numbered 60 and 62, respectively. The gate speed is again seen to increase and the increase was approximately 15 percent. The following is a list of parameters used in generating the data shown in Figures 11a and 11b Figure 12 shows a SDFL inverter with bootstrap. The operation of the circuit of Figure 12 was compared both with and without bootstrap. Similar components between Figures 10 and 12 are like numbered. Additional diodes 66 and 68 are placed along conductive path 20. The computer simulation results of this comparison of the SDFL inverter both with and without bootstrap are shown respectively in Figures 13a and 13b. Input and output voltages are numbered 60 and 62, respectively. The speed improvement with bootstrap in this case was approximately 18 . The following is a list of parameters used in generating the data shown in Figures 13a and 13b The power dissipated by the circuits simulated with and without bootstrap is kept at the same level respectively. Enhanced performance similar to that described immediately above is expected with all MESFET logic familites and with all MESFET logic gates.
