## Description
TITLE A Coating Composition Based On Acrylic Polymer Blends, Articles Coated Therewith, And Process For Preparing Said Coated Articles. BACXGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to coating compositions.In particular, it is directed toward lacquers whose principal film forming ingredients are two component blends of acrylic polymers, as disclosed in ZimmtUnited States Patent 3,823,205 issued July 9, 1974, which lacquers contain certain ultraviolet light stabilizers selected to diminish the degradation effects of the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight. Sunlight is composed of electromagnetic radiation with energy in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum. When the ultraviolet portion of sunlight falls upon a clear surface coating, the energy may be partially or wholly absorbed by the coating. In many instances, the energy absorbed initiates a photochemicalreactionwhich causes discoloration and or physical failure of the coating.Pigmented surface coatings also suffer from ultraviolet degradation, The inclusion of an ultraviolet light stabilizer can increase the useful life of both clear and pigmented coatings. Ultraviolet light stabilizers protect the coatings by absorbing the destructive, high energy ultraviolet rays and converting such energy into non destructive heat energy. Rowever, these stabilizers tend to be quite selective as to their protective action for and in certain coating compositions and vary in effectiveness over different substrates. For this reason, they must be carefully chosen. Acrylic lacquer finishes are widely used on the exterior of automobiles and trucks. It has been found that an excellent appearance along with depth of color and metallic glamour can be obtained by applying a clear or transparent coat over the conventional colored or pigmented coat. However, the weatherability and durability of these clear coats have been found to be poor. Checking, cracking and flaking of the clear coat occur after relatively short periods of exposure to outdoor weathering, giving the automobile or truck an unsightly appearance. Refinishing of these weathered clear coats is difficult and expensive, since the clear coat must be sanded to remove cracked and flaked clear coat before a refinish coat can be applied. In an effort to retard or substantially reduce checking, cracking and flaking of the clear coat, conventional ultraviolet light stabilizers have been added to the clear coat. Also, the combination of a transparent pigment and an ultraviolet light screener has been added to the clear coat, as suggested byLaBerge United States Patent 3,407,156 issued October 22, 1968. In each of the above cases, the durability and weatherability of the clear coat was increased for a relatively small length of time but not to the extent required for a practical automotive or truck finish.There exists a felt need for acrylic lacquers effectively stabilized against ultraviolet radiation for use in a clear coat color coat system. Ultraviolet stabilizers have traditionally been used only in those coating compositions which are utilized as topcoats. The problem with thi s procedure has been the tendency of the stabilizer to leach out of the topcoat and escape into the atmosphere, leaving the topcoat susceptible to weathering. The composition of this invention has a preferred utility of being used as a clear coat color coat finish and particularly as the color coat of such a finish. It is theorized that th ultraviolet light stabilizer will migrate from the color coat into the clear coat, thereby protecting the clear coat against weathering. The preferred finish is one in which both the clear coat and the color coat contain one or more ultraviolet light stabilizers. Some of the stabilizer will be consumed from the clear surface through leaching, evaporation, and photochemical reaction. The high concentration of stabilizer in the color coat will serve as a reservoir and replenish the lost stabilizer through diffusion from the color coat to the clear coat. Acrylic lacquers prepared according to the teachings of Zimmt United States Patent 3,823,205 give finishes having excellent air dry gloss and higher water spot free temperatures and lower craze free temperatures than finishes formed from compositions whose film forming components are conventional polymer systems. These advantages make the Zimmt lacquers useful as automotive lacquers. The novel compositions of this invention, consisting essentially of the Zimmt lacquers and carefully selected ultraviolet light stabilizers, are even more useful, particularly when utilized in clear coat color coat finishes as described. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Acrylic lacquers are prepared according to the teachings of Zimmt United States Patent 3,823,205. The lacquer may be either clear or pigmented, depending upon its intended use. These lacquers contain about 1 20 by weight, and preferably about 5 8 by weight, based on the binder of the coatings, i.e., on the weight of the film forming acrylic blends, of ultraviolet light stabilizer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A coating composition has been developed in which selected ultraviolet light stabilizers are incorporated into acrylic lacquers prepared by the method disclosed in Zimmt United States Patent 3,823,205. The teachings of the Zimmt patent are hereby incorporated by reference Th principal film forming ingredients in these lacquers are two component blends of acrylic polymers. One component of these blends Component A , making up at least 5 of the blends total weights, can be poly methyl methacrylate , poly ethyl methacrylate , poly propyl methacrylate , poly isopropyl methacrylate or a copolymer of methyl methacrylate with at least one of an alkyl acrylate whose alkyl group contains 1 through 20 carbon atoms, an alkyl methacrylate whose alkyl group contains 2 through 18 carbon atoms, or styrene.Mixtures of these can be also used. The other component of the blends ComponentB , also making up at least 5 o the blends total weights, is a two monomeric component copolymer of methyl methacrylate with at least one of an alkyl acrylate whose alkyl group contains 1 through 10 carbon atoms or an alkyl methacrylate whose alkyl group contains 4 through 18 carbon atoms. Mixtures of these can also be used. The differences in glass transition temperature between Component A and Component B is at least 300C. One preferred acrylic lacquer is a solution in which Component A is at least one of 1 poly methyl methacrylate , 2 poly ethyl methacrylate , 3 poly propyl methacrylate , 4 poly isopropyl methacrylate , 5 a copolymer composed only of methyl methacrylate and at least one of an alkyl acrylate whose alkyl group contains 1 through 20 carbon atoms, an alkyl methacrylate whose alkyl group contains 2 through 18 carbon atoms, or styrene, or 6 mixtures of these andComponent B is at least one of 1 a copolymer composed only of methyl methacrylate and an alkyl acrylate whose alkyl group contains 1 through 10 carbon atoms or an alkyl methacrylate whose alkyl group contains 4 through 18 carbon atoms, or 2 mixtures of said copolymers and the solution contains an inert organic solvent for the above polymers. In another acrylic lacquer, particularly preferred, Component A of the blend is poly methyl methacrylate and Component B is at least one of 1 a methyl methacrylate methyl acrylate copolymer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 70 30 to 40 60 respectively, 2 a methyl methacrylate ethyl acrylate copolymer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 80 20 to 40 60 respectively, 3 a methyl methacrylate butyl acrylate copolymer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 85 15 to 65 35 respectively, 4 a methyl methacrylate 2 ethylhexyl acrylate co polymer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 90 10 to 70 30 respectively, 5 a methyl methacrylate octyl methacrylate copolymer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 85 15 to 65 35 respectively, or 6 a methyl methacrylate lauryl methacrylate copoly mer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 90 10 to 75 25 respectively. The lacquers are prepared by first selectingComponent A and Component B and their concentrations according to the properties desired of the finish and then thoroughly mixing solutions or dispersions of these components in organic liquids, together with such other adjuncts as appear desirable. Illustrative of organic liquids which can be used are toluene, ketones such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, alcohols such as ethanol and 2 propanol, or mixtures of these. Before use, the compositions are thinned to application viscosity with customary lacquer solvents. These compositions will ordinarily have solids contents of from about 20 to 40 , by weight, of the total composition. Well known standard solution polymerization techniques and conventional catalysts are used in the preparation of Components A and B. It is generally desirable to add a plasticizer to the compositions. Plasticizers compatible with poly methyl methacrylate , such as dibutyl phthalate, bis methylcyclohexyl phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate, tributyl citrate, polyester plasticizers and alkyd resins are satisfactory. Whichever plasticizer is used, it is ordinarily present at a concentration of from about 2 through about 25 , by weight, of the solids of the composition. The acrylic lacquer can contain an alkyd resin and a cellulose acetate butyrate resin. If it is to be employed as a color coat, the lacquer contains pigment in a pigment to binder eight ratio of about 1 100 to about 150 100. Any of the conventional pigments used in coating compositions, including metallic flake pigments, can be used. If the lacquer is to be employed as a clear coat, it may contain transparent pigments, i.e., pigments having the same or similar refractive index as the binder of the clear coat which are of a small particle size of about 0.015 50 microns.Typical pigments that can be used in a pigment tobinder weight ratio of about 1 100 to 10 100 include inorganic siliceous pigments such as silica pigments.These pigments have a refractive index of about 1.41.6. One or more ultraviolet light stabilizers ar2 selected from the following Triazoles such as 2 phenyl 4 2 4 dihydroxy benzoyl triazoles, substituted benzotriazoles such as hydroxyphenyltriazoles such as 2 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl benzotriazole, 2 2 hydroxyphenyl benzo triazole, 2 2 hydroxy 5 octylphenyl naphthotriazole Triazines such as 3,5 dialkyl 4 hydroxyphenyl derivatives of triazine, sulfur containing derivatives of diallyl 4 hydroxyphenyltriazines, hydroxyphenyl1,3,5 triazines and such triazines containing sulfonic acid groups, aryl 1,3,5 triazines, orthohydroxyaryl striazine Benzoates such as dibenzoate of diphenylolpropane, t butyl benzoate of diphenylolpropane, nonyl phenyl benzoate, octyl phenyl benzoate, resorcinol dibenzoate. Other ultraviolet light stabilizers that can be used include lower alkyl thiomethylene containing phenols, substituted benzenes such as 1,3 bis 2 hydroxybenzoyl benzene, metal derivatives of 3,5, di tbutyl 4 hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, asymmetrical oxalic acid diarylamides, alkylhydroxyphenylthioalkanoic acid esters, dialkylhydroxyphenylalkanoic acid esters of di and tri pentaerythritol, phenyl and naphthlenesubstituted oxalic acid diamides, methyl 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propionate, bis 2 hydroxy phenyl diisopropylbenzene, 3,5 dibromo 2 hydroxyacetophenone, ester derivatives of 4,4 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl pentanoic acid wherein there is at least one unsubstituted position ortho to the aromatic hydroxyl groups, organophosphorus sulfides such as bis diphenylphosphinothioyl monosulfide and bisEdiphenylphosphino thioyl disulfide, 4 benzoyl 6 dialkylhydroxybenzyl resorcinol, bis 3 hydroxy 4 benzoylphenoxy diphenylsi lane, bis 3 hydroxy 4 benzoylphenoxy dialkylsilane, 1,8 naphthalimides, 6 cyano , diphenylacrylic acid derivatives, bis 2 benzoxazolyl alkanes, bis 2 napthoxazolyl alkanes, methylene malonitriles containing aryl and heterocyclic substitutes, alkylenebis dithio carbamate, 4 benzoyl 3 hydroxyphenoxyethyl acrylate, 4benzoyl 3 hydroxyphenoxyethyl methacrylate, aryl or alkyl substituted acrylonitriles, 3 methyl 5 isopropylphenyl 6 hydroxycoumarone. Particularly useful ultraviolet light stabilizers that can be used are hindered amines of bipiperidyl derivatives such as those disclosed in Murayama et al.,U.S. Patent 4,061,616, issued December 6, 1977, column 2, line 65, through column 4, line 2, and nickel com pounds such as 1 phenyl 3 methyl 4 decanoylpyrazolate 5 7 Ni, bisLj heny3dithiocarbamato7LNi IS , and others listed in the above patent, column 8, line 44 through line 55. Acrylic lacquers prepared in the manner described and containing about 1 20 by weight, and preferably about 5 8 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of selected ultraviolet light stabilizers prove particularly useful in the clear coat color coat finishes described. The lacquers can be applied to a variety of substrates, such as glass, plastics, metal, and the like, by spraying, dipping or brushing. Although the wet films can be air dried without sacrificing gloss, it is preferred that they be baked at temperatures of from about 1050C. to about 1650C. for about 20 to 30 minutes.
