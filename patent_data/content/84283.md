# Improved steering effort sensor apparatus.

## Abstract
A sensor arrangement 12 features a rolling element 16 and cam groove arrangement 18 which induces a displacement via which a switch 14 may be closed to indicate that torque is being applied via a steering wheel 1 to an upper section 2 of a steering shaft arrangement and which provides an essentially instantaneous drive connec tion between the upper 2 and a lower 4 section of the steering shaft arrangement thus maintaining a desirable degree of torsional rigidity.
