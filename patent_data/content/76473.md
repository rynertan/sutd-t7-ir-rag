# Aqueous developable photopolymer compositions containing terpolymer binder.

## Abstract
Compatible, aqueous developable photopolymerizable composition consisting essentially of a 22 to 32 by wt. of a monomeric compound having at least two terminal ethylenic groups, b 0.1 to 5.0 by wt of a photoinitiator or initiator system, c 40 to 80 by wt of a binder system which is the reaction product of 1 65 to 87 parts by wt of a terpolymer of methylmethacrylate, butylmethacrylate and methacrylic acid as defined, 2 5 to 20 parts by wt of a polyamide resin and 3 5 to 20 parts by wt of a copolymer of vinyl pyrrolidone and vinyl acetate, d 0.03 to 0.10 by wt of a thermal polymeriza tion inhibitor, and optionally up to 18 by wt of a plasticizer and up to 2.0 by wt of a tertiary amine capable of salt formation with a carboxylic acid. Aqueous developable photopolymerizable elements comprise a support bearing a layer of the composition. Relief printing plates can be prepared by imagewise exposing and developing the ele ments.
