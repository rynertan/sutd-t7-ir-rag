# NUCLEOTIDE HYBRIDIZATION ASSAY FOR PROTOZOAN PARASITES

## Abstract
The present invention provides a method for detection of protozoan parasites in blood or other specimen from their mammalian hosts. The method comprises nucleic acid hybridization of repetitive nuclear DNA fragments of the parasites. Hybridization probes have been prepared for this purpose by cloning the repetitive nuclear elements that are species specific in appropriate vectors. The sensitivity of these probes has been increased by further sub cloning to make them capable of cascade hybridization. The assay is highly specific and sensitive for detection of disease causing protozoan parasites of the commonly occurring Trypanoso matidae of the genus Leishmania and genus Trypanosoma, as well as for malaria causing protozoan and other parasitic microorganism of mammals.
