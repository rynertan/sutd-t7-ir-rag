# Method of and apparatus for processing a radiation image.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for processing a radiation image in a radiation image recording system in which a stimulable phosphor is stimulated with a scanning stimulat ing ray and the light emitted from the stimulable phosphor upon stimulation by the stimulating ray is detected by a detec tor which gives an output to be processed and used for record ing a visible image on a recording material. In the processing of the detected output, an operation represented by a formula S Sorg F X is conducted at every scanning point, where Sorg is the origi nal image signal detected by the detector, Sus is an unsharp mask signal corresponding to a super low spatial frequency, X is Sorg Sus, and F X is a monotone increasing function which satisfies the condition of F X₁ F X₂ O for arbitrary values X₁, X₂ of X X₁ X₂ and in which there exists at least one certain value X₀ of X which satisfies the condition of F X₁ F X₂ when X₁ X₀ X₂ .
