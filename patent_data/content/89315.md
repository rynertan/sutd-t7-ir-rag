## Description
Pyrazolone compounds and a process for their manufactureThis invention relates to pyrazolone compounds a process for their manufacture and their use in photographic material.Substituted pyrazolone compounds which are used as colour couplers in colour photographic materials have long been known. These compounds are useful as the magenta coupling components in tri pack colour photographic materials.Use of pyrazolone compounds in the photographic field is described for example in the Theory of the Photographic Process 4th edn.ed.T.H. James. p. 356 358. However most of these pyrazolone compounds are difficult and expensive to manufacture, because of the need to incorporate into the pyrazolone molecule the features giving good colour absorption to the dye produced by coupler.Recently, there has been interest in photographic materials which comprise mixtures of colour couplers to give monochrome images, for example as described in European Patent application 25,775. In such materials it is no longer necessary for the dyes produced from each coupler to have the single sharp absorption maximum necessary in colour negatives. Thus we have found new pyrazolone compounds which have a high secondary absorption in the blue region of the visible spectrum which are useful in chromogenic monochrome negative material, moreover they are easy and cheap to manufacture. Use of these compounds in chromogenic monochrome materials results in useful economies, not only because of the easy synthesis of these compounds, but also because of the reduction of the coating weight of the yellow coupler present in the assembly to give an overall neutral density. According to the present invention there is provided a pyrazolone compound of the formulaEMI2.1 where Y is CR1R2R3, wherein R1, R2 and R3 are each independently alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl which groups are unsubstituted or substituted, or two or three of the groups R1, R2 and R3 form a 5 or 6 membered monocylic or polycylic ring system which is unsubstituted or substituted, X is hydrogen or a leaving group and Q is hydrogen, amidino, alkyl or aryl which groups are unsubstituted or substituted, there being present in Y or Q a ballasting group which comprises 10 to 30 carbon atoms.Further objects of the present invention are a process for the preparation of these pyrazolone compounds and a photographic material containing these compounds.Y in the compounds of the formula 1 is a tertiary group of the formulaEMI2.2 Independently from one another, R1, R2 and R3 are alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl. These groups may be further substituted.Preferred alkyl groups are long chain alkyl groups, preferably having 10 to 20 carbon atoms such as decyl, dodecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl, nonadecyl and eicosyl as well as isomers thereof. These long chain alkyl groups act as a ballasting group and preferably one of R1, R2 and R3 represents a ballasting alkyl group. 3 It is also possible that R1, R2 or R3 represents a group which comprises a ballasting group. Such groups are preferably of the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R is alkyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, R is alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, x is 0, 1 or 2, and n is 1 or 2. Preferably, if n is 1, R is a long chain alkyl group of 10 to 20 carbon atoms, pentadecyl e.g., and, if n is 2, R is preferably alkyl having up to 10 carbon atoms such as t amyl. Another group which comprises a ballasting group is a substituted phenyl radical such as long chain alkyl or thioalkyl substituted phenyl, where the alkyl moieties contain preferably 10 to 20 carbon atoms. If R1, R2 and R3 are a non ballasting alkyl group, then this alkyl group preferably comprises 1 to 10 and, more preferably 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or pentyl. Suitable aryl groups R1, R2 and R3 are phenyl, and naphthyl, e.g. Benzyl, phenylethyl and benzhydryl are preferred aralkyl radicals R1, R2 and R3. In the meaning of alkaryl, R1, R2 and R3 preferably represent a phenyl radical which is substituted by preferably 1 or 2 alkyl groups which has have each 1 to 10 carbon atoms.such as methyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, octyl and decyl as well as isomers thereof.Further substituents on these groups R1, R2 and R3 comprise alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulphonyl, arylsulphonyl, where the alkyl moieties preferably contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms and aryl preferably denotes phenyl, carboxylic ester,preferably alkyl ester, having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group or amide, sulphonamido and halogen such as chlorine or bromine. Two of R1, R2 and R3 or all of R1, R2 and R3 form ring systems which are mono or polycyclic. Preferably, these ring systems contain 5 or 6 ring atoms per ring , preferably carbon atoms, and are e.g. cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl which may be further substituted by alkyl groups such as methyl, propyl, i propyl, butyl or t butyl. Preferred polycyclic ring systems contain 2 or 3, preferably saturated rings and are e.g. decalinyl, tetradecahydrophe nanthrenyl, tetradecahydroanthracenyl, adamantyl, bicycloheptyl and camphanyl. These ring systems may also be further substituted by alkyl groups preferably each having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl or i propyl. Such systems also act as ballasting groups.X is hydrogen or a leaving group which leaves the pyrazolone ring system when coupling with the oxidation product of a developing agent. Suitable leaving groups are essentially those which are commonly used in photographic colour couplers, e.g. 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic rings of the formulaEMI4.1 W represents the non metallic atoms necessary to complete the ring system which may be further substituted by alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, where the alkyl moieties preferably contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms and aryl preferably denotes phenyl, or by carboxylic acid or amido groups. Suitable ring systems are e.g. inidazole, pyrazole, triazole and dimethylimidazol. Other suitable leaving groups are SR5, OR5 and OCOR5, where R5 is alkyl, preferably having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, aryl, preferably phenyl, or a heterocyclic system such as triazole or tetrazole, which systems may be further substituted by alkyl having preferably 1 to 5 carbon atoms.

This is to render the coupler and the dye formed therefrom substantive to the photographic layer in which it was coated, and to give oil solubility to the coupler. A particularly suitable ballasting group is the di tert amylphenoxy group. The high secondary density of the dyes formed by the couplers of the present invention is believed to be caused by the presence of the tertiary substituent Y in the 3 position of the pyrazolone ring.In suitable compounds of the formula 1 R1, R2 and R3 are each independently alkyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, phenyl, naphthyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, benzhydryl or phenyl substituted by 1 or 2 alkyl groups each having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, these radicals being unsubstituted or substituted by alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio, alkylsulphonyl, arylsulphonyl, carboxylic ester or amide, sulphonamido or halogen.Preferably, R1, R2 and R3 are each independently unsubstituted or substituted by alkyl alkoxy, alkylthio or alkylsulphonyl, the alkyl moieties each having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, phenyl, phenoxy, phenylthio, phenylsulphonyl, carboxylic alkyl ester having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, carboxylic amide, sulphonamido, chlorine or bromine.

A particularly suitable solvent is ethanol together with an acetic acid catalyst and at reflux temperature.Alternatively and additionally the condensation of the keto ester of formula 11 and the hydrazine of formula 12 may be facilitated if certain of the substituent groups are present in protected forms.An example is the protection of a hydroxyl group as an ester during the condensation with subsequent liberation of the free hydroxyl group.A further modification is, for example, the presence of a nitro group during the condensation, which can subsequently be reduced and reacted to form amide or sulphonamide groups.The coulour photographic material of the present invention is of particular use as chromogenic monochrome film material wherein after imagewise exposure and colour development the dye formed from the colour coupler or couplers present in the material form a monochrome image from which black and white prints may be obtained. When the photographic silver halide material of the present invention after imagewise exposure is processed to form a dye image from the pyrazolone colour coupler the photographic material which comprises in a layer thereof a compound of formula 1 is processed after exposure by a colour development process using a primary aromatic amine colour developing agent of known type. As usual in colour development processes the primary aromatic amine developing agent reduces the latent silver image to form a silver image and becomes oxidised, and the oxidised colour developer couples with the pyrazolone colour coupler of formula 1 to form reddish dye image.After the colour development reaction to form the dye image the unexposed silver halide in the photographic material is removed using a silver halide solvent and the silver image is removed using a silver bleach bath. The silver halide and the silver may be removed by use of a single bleach fix blix bath.Suitable primary aromatic amine colour developing agents are p phenylenediamine compounds, for example 4 amino N, N dimethylaniline hydrochloride, 4 amino N,N diethylaniline hydrochloride, 4 amino 3 methyl N,N diethylaniline hydrochloride and p aminophenol compounds for example a p aminophenol itself and 2,6 dichloro 4aminophenol.The following Examples will serve to illustrate the invention m.p. means melting point .Example 1 a 3 t Butyl l 4 nitrophenyl pyrazolone 2 ene 5 ene Ethyl pivaloyl acetate 4.55 g and 4 nitrophenyl hydrazine 3.82 g are fused at 13O0C and heated for 10 minutes.
