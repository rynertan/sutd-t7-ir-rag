# A reagent and a method for the extraction of copper from an ammoniacal copper solution.

## Abstract
Copper can be extracted from an ammoniacal copper solution by contacting said solution with an organic phase containing a first extraction reagent consisting of a betadiketone as well as a second extraction reagent consist ing of a hydroxy oxime, a hydroxy quinoline, or an alkylaryl sulphonamido quinoline. Alternatively, the copper solution can first be contacted with an organic phase containing the first extraction agent, and subsequently be contacted with an organic phase containing the second extraction reagent. It is possible to reach a low percentage of copper in the aqueous solution by using a low number of extraction steps.
