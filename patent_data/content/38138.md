# Gasification of solid carbonaceous material for use in a turbine generator power installation.

## Abstract
Coke, oil shale residue, tar sands or preferably coal is gasified with oxygen and steam to produce syngas, part of which is catalytically converted into dimethyl ether and the remainder of wich is used directly in fired turbines for electric power generation. The dimethyl ether is stored and then used in fired turbines to gene rate electric power during periods of high power de mand.
