# Halftone image recording method and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A halftone image is reproduced and recorded by photo electrically scanning an original in the following manner. One of the density range, hue range and coordinate range of the original or an image, which has been obtained by modifying the original as desired, is divided into a suitable number of regions having a prescribed width. One of plural kinds of halftone signals of different halftone shapes is then selected for each of the thus divided regions in accordance with a region signal corresponding to the same divided region, whereby a halftone image containing plural kinds of dot shapes is recorded. An apparatus for practising the above method is also described.
