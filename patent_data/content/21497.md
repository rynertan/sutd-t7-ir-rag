## Description
SYNTHESIS OF POLYOXYALYLENE GLYCOL MONOALKYL FTJIERS Technical Field Commercial processes for producing monoalkyl ethers of polyoxyalkylene glycols condense the corresponding alkylene oxide with a primary alcohol to produce compounds having varying oxyalkylene chain lengths. For example, the condensation of lauryl alcohol with ethylene oxide will yield a lauryl ethoxylate having a Poisson distribution of chain lengths. For some applications, it is desirable and neces sary to have monoalkyl ethers of polyoxyalkylene glycols with a homogeneous oxyalkylene chain length. U.S. Patent 4,067,961, Laughlin, January 10, 1978, discloses the use of monodecyl tetraoxyethylene glycol and monodecyl per1ta oxyethylene glycol as spermicides in contraceptive devices. British Patent 1,462,134, Collins, January 19, 1977, discloses the superiority of a narrowly defied range of monoalkyl ethers, especially monodecyl tetraoxyethylene glycol, in cleaning organic hydrophobic soils from synthetic fabrics. Homogeneous monoalkyl ethers have been Produced by two general types of reactions, by the reaction of an alkyl paratoluenesulfonate with a polyalkylene glycol, or by a Williamson ether synthesis reaction using an alkyl bromide and an alkali metal polyoxyalkylene glycoxide. In Williamson ether syntheses, the alkoxylate is usually formed by the reaction of glycol with alkali metal or alkali metal hydroxide to generate theglycoxide, followed by reaction with an alkyl halide, all in R nonaqueous medium. Q raditional Williamson ether synthesis reactions have the disadvantages of requiring the handling of large amounts of sodium or sodium hydrides and producing products contaminated with lower alkoxylogs and with dialkylated products. Recently, Williamson ether syntheses have been performed using phase transfer techniques. A heterogeneous reaction mixture, usually having an organic solvent phase and a concentrated aqueous hydroxide phase, together with a phase transfer catalyst has been used to prepare ethers under mild conditions. Although aqueous conditions can be used and reaction conditions are relatively mild, phase transfer catalysis conditions have the disadvantage of generally requiring the use of a solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, benzene, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfoxide, as well as the use of a catalyst which must ultimately be separated from the product. Typical phase transfer catalysts are tetrasubstituted ammonium halides and sulfates Q , e.g. tetrabutylammonium bromide or bisulfate, or benzyltriethylammonium chloride. Crown ethers. and cryptands have also been used as phase transfer catalysts. It has been suggested in tlie literature that phase transfer monoalkylation reactions involving diacids could be performed by strict control of the pH of the reaction mixture or by chemical reaction of the catalyst to poison it.However, the acidity of the polyoxyalkylene glycols is too low to take advantage of the pH effect. Additionally, a full equivalent of would be required. The present invention reflects the discovery that under Williamson phase transfer extractive alkylation conditions, a polyoxyalkylene glycol performs not only as a reactant, but also as its own phase transfer catalyst.Through the present invention, monoalkyl ethers of polyoxyalkylene glycols having homogeneous chain lengths are conveniently produced in high yields and excellent purity under phase transfer extractive alkylation conditions using purely stoichiometric control of the reactants. Additionally, the reaction proceeds without using extraneous organic solvents or extraneous phase transfer catalysts so that isolation and purification procedures can be greatly simplified. Background Art Recent Williamson ether syntheses have been performed using phase transfer techniques with heterogeneous reaction mixtures, organic solvent and concentrated aqueous hydroxide, and a phase transfer catalyst. Freedman, et al., Tet. Tor., 3251 1975 . The phase transfer catalyst forms an ion pair with the water soluble organically insoluble alkoxide which preferentially partitions into the organic layer where reaction occurs. The strict exclusion of water required by the traditional Williamson procedure is not necessary and reaction conditions are relatively mild.The most widely used phase transfer catalysts are tetraalkylammonium salts, although crown ethers, cryptands, open chain polyethers Yanagida, et al., Bull.

Ltr., 2893 1977 and Lehmkuhl, et al., Synthesis, 184 1977 have also been used as catalysts. Brandstrom, in Adv. in Phys. Org. Chem., 15, 267 1977 , suggests the use of extractive alkylation conditions a 1 1 mole ratio of catalyst reactant instead of phase transfer catalytic conditions a 1 20 mole ratio of catalyst reactant to achieve selective alkylation of diacids. However, production of pure monoalkyl compound is achieved either by chemical reaction of catalyst, present in stoichiometric aa opposed to catalytic amounts, with halide to poison it, or by strict pH control. U.S. 4,061,682, Dubois, et al., Dec. 12, 1977, discloses the preparation of symmetrical ethers using alkyl or aryl halides, sulfates or sulfonates in the presence of an aqueous alkali or alkaline earth hydroxide, carboxylate salt and a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium catalyst. U.S. 3,914,320, Gordon, Oct. 21, 1975, also relates to the preparation of symmetrical ethers using halogenated hydrocarbons, alkali metal hydroxide and a quaternary salt catalyst.

Several older patents teach the preparation of monoalkylethoxylates through reaction of alkali metal hydroxide, alkyl or aralkyl halide, and polyol the reaction conditions are non aqueous.

None of the workers in the art appear to have appreciated the benefits and requirements of Applicant s solvent free etherification process. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention encompasses a solvent free method for preparing monoalkyl ethers of polyoxyalkylene glycols selected from the group consisting of polyoxyethylene glycols, polyoxypropylene glycols and mixed polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycols comprising mixing the polyoxyalkylene glycol with a concentrated aqueous solution of a metal hydroxide, contacting said mixture with an organohalide in a mole ratio of glycol to halide greater than about 2 1 and a mole ratio of hydroxide to halide greater than about 1 1, and recovering the monoalkyl polyoxyalkylene glycol ether.The outstand ing features of this invention are that monoethers of glycols can be easily prepared through purely stoichiometric control of the reactants and that extraneous solvents and catalysts are not needed for the process. Additionally, typical phase transfer catalysts and solvents can greatly decrease the yield of final product. The process of the present invention can be illustrated by the reaction of decyl bromide with tetraoxyethylene glycol to obtain monodecyl tetraoxyethylene glycol EMI6.1 By polyoxyalkylene glycol as used herein is meant a compound of the general formula HO CnH2nO XH wherein n is 2 or 3. The glycol can be of uniform n, for example polyoxyethylene glycol n 2 and polyoxypropylene glycol n 3 , or the glycol can have an n of mixed inte gers, i.e. a mixture of oxyalkylene components, for example HO C2H4O a CH6Ob C2H4O a H. The polyoxy alkylene glycols used wherein are polyoxyethylene glycols, polyoxypropylene glycols and mixed polyoxyethylene poly oxypropylene glycols. The most preferred glycols are polyoxyethylene glycols.The number of oxyalkylene units in the glycol x can be 2 or greater, e.g. monoalkyl ethers of dioxyethylene glycol and dodecaoxyethylene glycol can be easily obtained. The metal hydroxide used herein is typically an alkali metal hydroxide or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, for example. The preferred metal hydroxides are alkali metal hydroxides and the most preferred hydroxides are sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The organohalides used herein can be any convenient organic halide that does not undergo base catalyzed reactions. Straight chain alkyl halides of chain lengthC2 and greater which have a melting point below the temperature at which the reaction of the glycol hydroxide mixture with the halide is to be performed are the preferred organohalides. Typical halides include ethyl chloride, dodecyl bromide, and stearyl iodide. The preferred alkyl halides are of chain length C5 C15 and the most preferred are of chain length C8 C14. The present invention can also be used to extend polyoxyalkylene glycol chain lengths by reaction of shorter chain polyoxyalkylene glycols with a terminal dihalopolyoxyalkylene ether. For example, a polyoxyethylene glycol of the above general formula having 9 oxyalkylene units x 9 can be prepared from two glycols having 3 oxyalkylene units x 3 through reaction with Cl C2lI4O 2CH2CHzCl. The terminal dihalopolyoxyalkylene ether is of the general formula Y CnH2nO xC2HnY whereinY is halogen. As with the polyoxyalkylene glycols, the polyoxyalkylene ether portion of the terminal dihalopolyoxyalkylene ether can also have uniform or mixed n, oxyalkylene groups. The preferred dihalo ethers have n 2 or 3 or mixtures, i.e. polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene, or mixed polyoxyethylene propylene.The preferred halides are the chloride and the bromide and the preferred dihalo ethers are dihalopolyoxyethylene ethers. By comprising as used herein is meant that other steps and materials can be used and present so long as they do not adversely affect the desirable characteristics of the invention. Thus the term comprising encompasses the more restrictive terms consisting essentially of and consisting of. The following general procedure is applicable to the preparation of any monoalkyl ether of a polyoxyalkylene glycol. A mixture of concentrated aqueous metal hydroxide and glycol is heated for about one half hour in an oil bath at the temperature at which the reaction is to be performed. The mixture is stirred while a stream of argon flushes air from. the system. Alkyl halide is added and the reaction is allowed to proceed for the desired time.After cooling, the mixture is diluted with water, extracted exhaustively with any suitable organic solvent, e.g. ether, toluene or benzene, dried over a suitable drying agent, e.g. magnesium sulfate, filtered and stripped on a rotary evaporator. The metal hydroxide is typically used in concentrated aqueous solution, preferably greater than about 30 by weight and most preferably 50 or greater by weight. The greater the amount of water present in the reaction mixture, the slower the rate of reaction and the more side products formed. The metal hydroxide is used at a mole ratio of hydroxide alkyl halide of greater than about 1 1. The yield of pure monoalkyl alkyoxylate is substantially unaffected with any more than about a 5 molar excess of hydroxide as compared to alkyl halide 1.05 1 . Since the rate of the reaction will increase with increasing molar amounts of hydroxide, a mole ratio of hydroxide halide of greater than about 5 1 increases the rate of reaction significantly. however, because it is easier to remove and recover unreacted glycol in subsequent purification procedures where less base is used, the pre ferred hydroxide halide mole ratio is from about 1.05 1 to about 2 1. The mixing of glycol and hydroxide can take place in any convenient manner that will effect an intimate mixture of the components. Typically, mechanical agitation by stirring is adequate. After the hydroxide and glycol are mixed, air is flushed from the system by inert gas sparging argon is convenient. Unless air is removed from the reaction vessel, there is a tendency to form undesirable side products. The agitation of the inert gas flush also provides some mixing of the glycol and hydroxide. After the reaction vessel and mixture are sparged, the organohalide, preferably an alkyl halide, is added.The alkyl halide is most preferably primary since secondary alkyl halides are subject to elimination reactions giving undesirable side products. The most preferred alkyl halides are alkyl bromides and chlorides. Alkyl compounds having soft leaving grcups such as iodides can be used in the reactions of the present invention but they tend to have undesirable hydrolysis and elimination reactions which give side products. Generally the alkyl chlorides and the alkyl bromides are equally desirable, but at at mole ratios of glycolalkyl halide of from about 2 1 to about 5 1, alkyl chlorides are preferred since alkyl bromides have a greater tendency to form dialkyl ethers instead of pure monoalkyl ethers. The mole ratio of glycol alkyl halide is greater than about 2 1, preferably greater than about 5 1 and is most preferably greater than about 10 1. The alkyl halide is added to the concentrated aqueous hydroxide glycol mixture in the reaction vessel.It is to be understood that the reaction mixture is a two phase system after the addition of the halIde. The reaction of halide with glycol proceeds as the glycol functions as its own phase transfer catalyst by which an ion pair of glycol and glycoxide passes into the halide phase for reaction. Mechanical agitation is generally desirable to promote thorough mixing of the reactants, but such agitation does not affect the rate of the phase transfer reaction. Where the mole ratio of glycol alkyl halide is greater than about 10 1 and the ratio of hydroxide alkyl halide is greater than about about 1.05 1, there are substantially no side reactions or production of dialkyl ethers. The reaction of alkyl halide and glycol is convenient to carry out, requiring only the mixing of glycol and sodium hydroxide solution with the halide, followed by heating for, routinely, 8 to 24 hours at a convenient temperature, usually in the range of 600C to 1200C, but typically 1000C. The product can be recovered and purified using standard synthetic techniques. Typical recovery.and purification procedures include solvent partition for extraction of the monoalkyl ether, drying, filtration, solvent stripping and further purification techniques. Where longer chain polyoxyalkylene glycols are being prepared from shorter chain polyoxyalkylene glycols and terminal dihalopolyoxyalkylene glycol ethers, the same procedures are followed as in synthesizing the monoalkyl ethers. Additionally, monoalkyl ethers of ethylene glycol can be prepared using the same procedures as are used in preparing monoalkyl ethers of polyoxyalkylene glycols.
