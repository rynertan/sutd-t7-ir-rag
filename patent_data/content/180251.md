# IMPROVED DEBRIS SYSTEM FOR STREET SWEEPERS

## Abstract
A street sweeper has floating support apparatus for supporting both a pick up broom and a pair of laterally and forwardly disposed gutter brushes beneath a sweeper framework and for providing controlled broom and brush pressures on the surface being swept. A ball bushing and vertical shaft provide gutter brush suspension and spherical bearings and support arms provide pick up room suspen sion. The gutter brushes and pick up broom are directly dri ven by hydraulic motors mounted on their respective sus pension structures. Debris is directed inwardly on the swept surface by the gutter brushes toward the path of the pick up broom. Laterally disposed dirt shoes lie adjacent the ends of the pick up broom to prevent debris from flowing around the ends of the broom, whereby debris is further guided in wardly toward the pick up broom for propulsion toward an elevator for transfer into a framework mounted debris hopper.
