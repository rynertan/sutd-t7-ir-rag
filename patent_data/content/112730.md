# A stepper motor control system.

## Abstract
A stepper motor control system for rotating a stepper mo tor by a desired amount of movement, comprising a first ROM ROM₃ for storing acceleration control data, a second ROM ROM₄ for storing deceleration control data, and a change point control circuit for controlling a change point period be tween acceleration and deceleration, whereby, the accelera tion is smoothy joined to the deceleration through the change point period so that the rotor of the stepper motor stops in stantly and accurately at the target position.
