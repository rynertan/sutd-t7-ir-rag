# A DEVICE FOR ROTATIVELY DRIVING AN AWNING CONTROL ROD

## Abstract
The invention relates to the technical field of the sunshade awning control, and in particular to a device for rotatively driving an awning control rod. The technical problem on which the present invention is based is to provide such a device with fully automatic operation features in order to avoid the need for any manual effort, as well as with a simple low cost construction, so that additionally to being convenient to use it can find wide spread application potentials. The problem is solved by the provision of a device comprising a substantially closed body 7,7a rotatably engageable with one end of an awning 1 control rod 2 and at least one handgrip 8,23a enabling an operator to handle a said body 7,7a , as well as an internally mounted electric motor 16,16a , a reduction gear 14,14a connecting said electric motor 16,16a to said rod 2 and including a number of gear pairs defining a high step down ratio, members 17,17a for supplying an electric current to said electric motor, and control elements 19,19a for said electric motor 16,16a enabling an operator to selectively control the motor direction of rotation.
