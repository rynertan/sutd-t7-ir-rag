# Joystick controller.

## Abstract
A joystick controller in which a conventional handle 20 is moveable radially with respect to its axis relative to an axial pivot location from the nominal rest position of the handle 20 is disclosed. A plurality of pressure actuated switches 46 49 are disposed in a common plane normal to the axis of the handle 20 in its rest position. The switches 46 49 cir cumscribe the approximate pivot location of the handle 20 . A deformable resilient annular member 58 is superimposed over the switches 46 49 . The annular member 58 is fixed to the handle 20 so that displacement of the handle 20 from its rest position causes an arcuate portion 74 of the annular member 58 to press against at least one of the switches 46 49 . The annular member 58 thus actuates selected switches 46 49 depending on the direction in which the handle 20 is displaced by the operator.
