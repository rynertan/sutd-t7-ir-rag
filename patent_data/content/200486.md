## Description
This invention relates to articles which are composite structures and a method therefore, the articles comprising a polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE fibril matrix in which is enmeshed and immobilized viable cells. The articles are useful, for example, as industrial catalysts in organic synthesis, fermentation, and removal of chemical pollutants. In the United States high tech goals are becoming precise. In a recently issued report see report summary in Chem. Eng. News, Membrane research has been ongoing since the early 1900 s. For example, binding of enzymes to suitable insoluble substrates to render the resultant product commercially useful is known. Such immobilization techniques for microbial cells and enzymes have been classified into three methods carrier binding method, cross linking method, and trapping method by I. Chibata in Basic Biology of New Developments in Biotechnology , A. Hollaender et al., editors, Plenum Press, NY, 1983, pp. 465 496. Chibata supra, at p. 469 has cautioned that these immobilizations should be carried out under very mild conditions to avoid the inactivation of enzymes. It is known that living cells, which contain such enzymes, are even more sensitive than the enzymes, because the conditions that destroy the efficacy of the enzyme will cause the death of the living cell even more easily. Membrane technology is reviewed by D.C. Warren in New Frontiers in Membrane Technology and Chromatography Applications for Biotechnology , Analytical Chemistry, It is also known in the art to immobilize living cells encased in continuous domains such as alginic acid and polymers. Enzymes adsorbed onto inorganic particulates and then dispersed throughout the interstices of a network of interconnected, interwoven fibers of PTFE fibrilated PTFE have been described in U.S. Patent No. 3,766,013. This patent further teaches that particulate material modified by surface adsorption of enzymes can be mixed with PTFE and the mixture fibrillated into a coherent mass. The ability to fibrilate polytetrafluoroethylene emulsion and mix particulate material with it and then convert the product to a porous sheet has been described in U.S. Patent No. 4,194,040, and methods for making such fibrillated polymers have been reported in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,864,124 and 4,153,661. Recently, enthusiasm for immobilizing enzymes has been summarized by T. H. Maugh II in A Renewed Interest in Immobilized Enzymes , Science, 223, 474 476 1984 . Immobilization of microorganisms on supports such as agar, alginate, carrageenan, cellulose, polyacrylate, and polyamide has been described by S. Birnbaum, P. Larson, and K. Mosbach in Solid Phase Biochemistry, W. H. Scouten, Ed., Wiley, 1983, vol. 66, chapter 15. U.S. Patent No. 4,434,231 describes processes for embedding microorganisms within a matrix of a polymer gel, and U.S. Patent No. 4,452,892 teaches immobilization of biologically active material in a hydrogel on a support. U.S. Patent No. 4,456,685 discloses polyurethane foams to which are bound aspartase producing microorganisms. Confining microbials to one side of a membrane filter in a dialyzer has been reported by W W Tso and W P Fung, Biotechnol. Lett., Briefly, the present invention provides articles which can be in the form of microporous films, composite sheets, fibers, granules and the like comprising a fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE matrix containing enmeshed and immobilized therein viable cells capable of their usual and continuous biochemical and biological performances. For example, yeast can convert sugar solution to alcohol and Bacillus can convert sugar solution to carboxylic acids. In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for the preparation of the above described articles comprising trapping, enmeshing, and immobilizing viable cells within a fibrillated PTFE matrix. In the present invention viable cells are immobilized by entrapment in a fibrillated polytetrafluoroethylene network which constitutes a composite sheet. Despite the work intensive nature of the method and the extraordinarily high localized pressure during processing, the resultant viable cells, generally isolated individually and restrained on all sides by a cage of fibrillated PTFE, surprisingly and unexpectedly, remain viable. In such microporous constructions, each immobilized viable cell can be in intimate contact with moving nutrient solution this is in contrast to gelled polymers as in prior art constructions, through which nutrient must diffuse only very slowly. Consequently, local concentration of viable cell products are kept low and the viable cells continues to thrive as if in a medium in which the cells waste products are removed continuously. The system acts like a reactive zone in which the viable cells are captive and the organism waste products which may be useful products of commerce are continuously removed. In another embodiment, the nutrients for the viable cells may be toxic or environmentally undesirable and are converted to an environmentally acceptable product s by the organism. In the present application The present invention provides a composite structure comprising Viable cells, particularly microorganisms, that are of special interest in this invention are unicellular organisms although multicellular organisms are also included. These organisms are by nature complex cells capable of conducting all the biochemical reactions necessary to their existance, nutrition, and reproduction. Examples of microorganisms that are useful in the present invention are Examples of microorganisms which are especially useful in this invention are The size of the viable cells can be within a broad range of 0.1 to 25 micrometers in diameter when dry. Preferably, the particle diameter size range of the viable cells is 0.1 to 15 micrometers. The viable cells are capable of surviving calendering procedures involving localized pressures in the range of 1000 mega pascals MPa to 3000 MPa and heat in the range of 30 to 45 C. The viable cells can have a sorptive capacity in the range of 2 to 20 grams of water per gram of dry cells. It is surprising that viable cells can survive the rigorous conditions necessary to prepare the fibrillated PTFE fibril matrix of the present invention. The PTFE composites can vary in thickness in the range of 0.2mm to 10mm. The composites are usually in the form of a sheet, which is very conformable and can be fashioned into any shape e.g., bent i.e., even wound around a rod 4 mm in diameter , corrugated, tubular, etc. . Various shapes can be prepared by extruding, wrapping, or bending the calendered PTFE sheets with particulate therein. Bioactive materials of the present invention can be prepared from microbiological cells and PTFE emulsion via a variation of the work intensive procedure described in U.S. Patent No. 4,153,661. As described in the method of U.S. Patent No. 4,153,661, the viable cells can be pre mixed with a diluent which can function, for example, as support, host, nutrient, or processing aid. Representative diluents can be calcium carbonate, kaolin, starch, sugar, polyethylene, zeolites, chitin, Sephadex , cellulosics, vermiculite, clay, and the like. These diluent materials can be present in an amount in the range of 0 to 14.995 parts per part of PTFE, provided that the viable cells plus diluent do not exceed 15 parts particulate to 1 part PTFE. These ranges are desirable to achieve a preferred tensile strength of at least 1.7 MPa in the composite structure. The present invention provides a novel composite structure and method therefore, the composite structure preferably being a uniformly porous, high void volume composite sheet comprised of viable cells distributed uniformly throughout a matrix formed of interentangled, fibrillated PTFE fibrils. In such a structure almost all of the cells are separate one from another and each is isolated in a cage that restrains the cell on all sides by a fibrillated mesh of PTFE microfibers. The preferred novel sheet of the invention has a high tensile strength of at least 1.7 MPa 250 PSI , and even as high as 13.6 MPa 2000 PSI , and is substantially uniformly porous, making it suited for use as a filtering material for pollution control, for preparation of specific chemicals, for example, antibiotics, and generation of usual fermentation products such as ethanol, acetone, and butyl alcohol, and even hormones, and for many other purposes which can be envisioned in the art for such materials. The method requires neither organic lubricants nor extraction of a removable additive material to produce porosity. The method involves first blending the viable cells with a PTFE aqueous dispersion into a damp paste and then adding sufficient lubricant water to exceed the absorptive capacity of the solids in the mixture yet maintain a putty like consistency. The resultant putty like mass is then intensively mixed at a temperature between 5 and 70 C, preferably between 20 and 40 C to fibrillate initially the PTFE particles and, while maintaining the same water content, the resultant mass is biaxially calendered between heated calendering rolls maintained at about 5 to 70 C, preferably 30 to about 40 C to cause further fibrillation, producing a composite sheet which, optionally, is then dried. The exact temperatures used are dictated by the sensitivity of the cells. The desired thickness of the film 0.2 to 10 mm is determined by the final spacing of the rollers. Biaxial calendering is accomplished by rotating a calendered sheet at 90 to the calendering machine direction and repeating the calendering operation with a reduction of the space between the calendering rolls or including folding the calendered sheet on itself before rotating or both. Such calendering provides uniform multidirectional fibril formation, imparting a high degree of tensile strength in the resultant sheet. The dried resultant composite comprises viable cells and PTFE fibrils in a weight ratio of about 0.005 1 to 15 1 viable cells material to PTFE fibrils. For the most part, the PTFE fibrils will have a diameter in the range of about 250 Å to 2500 Å. The composite is preferably characterized by having a tensile strength of at least 1.7 MPa. Depending on the nature of the viable cells in the construction, the article can be stored dried or hydrated. These are several key steps which are required in the method of the invention to produce the unique high tensile strength PTFE composite of the invention. The initial intensive mixing is accomplished at a temperature between about 5 and 70 C, preferably at an elevated temperature between 20 and about 40 C or the sheet will not have a sufficiently high tensile strength. Additionally, the water content of the putty like mass being processed should be maintained above or near the absorptive capacity of the solids therein or else proper fibrillation will not occur. The viability of films of the invention made from dried yeast has been demonstrated. It has been shown qualitatively that when these composite membranes are placed in conventional glucose nutrient solutions, conversion to ethanol begins soon thereafter, i.e. after three hours the aqueous solution contained 0.15 ethanol as determined by chromatographic analysis . Viable cells in the PTFE microfiber mesh can be in their natural environment, i.e., in the aqueous media on which they feed. This combination of physical integrity and natural efficacy permits maximal versatility in design of apparatus for applications. Before preparing the composite sheet of the invention it may be desirable to remove certain additives in commercially available PTFE. For example, Teflon emulsion 30 B Dupont contains about 60 weight percent PTFE and 8 weight percent surfactant. To minimize any possible undesirable or toxic effect of such surfactant or other additives already present in commercially available emulsions, the PTFE enmeshed product is washed thoroughly to remove such materials see Example 1, below . Composite films of the invention are excellent surface filters for viable cells as small as E. coli and even pseudomonads. It is anticipated that this technology may be a general method for immobilization of all viable cells perhaps with cell diameters of at least 0.1 micrometer. The articles of this invention are useful as industrial catalysts in continuous and batch operations in such processes as organic synthesis, fermentation, removal of chemical pollutants and the like, manufacture of many items of commerce such as ethanol, carboxylic acids, antibiotics, hormones and other biochemicals. It is also anticipated that the composite structures of the present invention will have applications such as photobiogeneration of H₂ and O₂ from H₂O collection of heavy metals from aqueous solution selective oxidation of organic feedstocks, and generation of the usual fermentation products such as acetone, ethanol, or butyl alcohol. Objects and advantages of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples, but the particular materials and amounts thereof recited in these examples, as well as other conditions and details, should not be construed to unduly limit this invention. In the following EXAMPLES, all temperatures are stated in degrees Centigrade. To 25 g of powdered Since the original commercially available polytetrafluoroethylene emulsion and the resultant film made therefrom contained about 8 polyalkyleneoxide hydrocarbon soap for stabilization, this soap was removed by immersion of the composite film in a water bath through which warm less than 40 C water was circulated slowly for about 18 hours. Samples of the soap free film 0.025 cm thick water swollen or air dried under tension were cut in the form of circles 44.2 square cm in area and then positioned on the macroporous plate of an Amicon Danvers, MA 402 Model 3155 ultrafiltration cell. Tap water 1.2L that was previously sterilized by boiling was made to permeate the reactive membrane film under 0.68 atmospheres of hydrodynamic pressure. The rate of flow, F ml min through the membrance film decreased with the total volume V L of water permeating the film as given by the expression The membrane film was then permeated by 1.4 L of freshly distilled water, during which time the flow rate at 0.68 atmosphere remained constant, F 19 ml min. The distilled water was then replaced by 1 glucose 0.06 M in distilled water and the flow rate F 13.8 ml min at 0.68 atmosphere remained constant. The percent alcohol generated see TABLE I below during passage of the glucose solution through the reactive membrane film containing the trapped yeast cells was determined by gas chromatography of the filtrate and was found to be independent of the total volume of 1 glucose solution but very dependent upon residence time, t, in the reaction zone, where The date of TABLE I show that the percent conversion of reactant to product is a linear function of the residence time t . FIGS. 3 to 6 of the Drawing show that almost all microbiological cells 85 are isolated individually and immobilized in individual compartments by PTFE microfibers 15 . It can be seen that the yeast cells are isolated in the microporous PTFE fiber enclosures. The cells are uniformly distributed both vertically and horizontally in linear planes that parallel the surface of the composite film. When wet, the cells are fully swollen and the physical appearance and texture of the film is that of a rubber like sheet but when dried under tension, the film texture and appearance is that of kid leather. A thin strip was cut from a PTFE microporous membrane as used in EXAMPLE 1 and inserted in a standard nutrient solution kept at 27 C such that the cells at the cut edge of the strip were free to escape from the membrane. These cells multiplied rapidly and generated copious quantities of carbon dioxide indicating continued cell viability. The yeast cells remained viable even after the composite film was used for one week as a reactive membrane. To 8 g of powdered The data of TABLE II show that the percent conversion of reactant to product is a function of residence time. Again, photographs of SEM images of freeze fractured samples after use in the example above showed that the microorganisms were isolated and trapped in the open, micropore structure of the PTFE membrane film. Strips cut from the PTFE miroporous membranes used in EXAMPLE 3 were immersed in a nutrient solution and the viable cells at the cut edge of the strip, which were free to escape from the membrane, multiplied rapidly indicating the viability of the microorganisms even after fabrication and a week of use as a reactive membrane film. A wet mass 18.7 g of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 0.203 g dry Pseudomonas per gram of wet mass was mixed with 16 g of Sephadex Pharmacia Fine Chemicals Co., Sweden that contained 50 water. To this mixture was added dropwise with constant stirring 8 g of Teflon 30 B aqueous emulsion, which contained 60 weight percent PTFE and 8 weight percent non ionic soap. The mixture was converted to a tough membrane at room temperature by a work intensive procedure using an ordinary rubber mill as described previously. The membrane obtained thereby was tumbled in a water bath for 24 hours to remove the soap solution. A circular sample 44.2 cm² x 0.2 cm thick 8.82 cm³ was cut from the water swollen membrane. Another sample was used to determine that the water swollen sample contained 2.1 g water per gram of dry composite, i.e., the weight of Pseudomonas in the 8.8 cm³ of membrane was The 8.8 cm³ membrane was fitted to a Amicon ultrafiltration cell with 430 ml capacity. Four hundred and twenty ml of distilled water was forced at 0.3 MPa 45 PSIG through the membrane. The rate of flow at this pressure was 2.5 cm³ hr. Hence, the residence time was 3.5 hours. An additional 420 ml of distilled water was allowed to permeate through the membrane over a period of 28 days via gravity feed. A 1 solution by weight of trypticase soy broth was allowed to permeate the membrane for three additional days followed by 420 ml of distilled water. The reservoir was then charged with an aqueous solution of 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid 21 parts per million which was forced at 0.28 MPa 41 PSIG through the membrane 8.8 cm³ at the rate of 8 ml hr. Thus, the residence time in the membrane was 1.1 hours. The amount of 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2, 4, 5 T in the eluate was determined by gas chromatography. The percent efficiency of removal at this residence time is given in TABLE III below as a function of days in operation. This data show that even Pseudomonas cells which were not conditioned to tolerate 2,4,5 T, after exposure to the membrane can be utilized to remove the toxicant 2,4,5 T for a period of at least 4 days. Additional trials showed that 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid was not removed when Sephadex alone was used as the only component other than PTFE in a composite membrane. Various modifications and alterations of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention, and it should be understood that this invention is not to be unduly limited to the illustrative embodiments set forth herein.
