# Method for production of mature asexual cacao embryos.

## Abstract
A method of producing mature cacao embryos involves culturing zygotic embryos in a basal medium with auxin and sugar to initiate asexual embryos, proliferating the embryos in the medium with low sugar content, and increasing the size and maturity of the embryos without germination and with increased sugar content in the medium.
