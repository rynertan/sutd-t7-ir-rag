# A vehicle step and ramp assembly.

## Abstract
The vehicle footboard or inclined loading platform com prises a rectangular frame 1 , to the top part of which is fixed a transiting platform 8 , that slides in a direction perpendicular to the side of the vehicle, in guides 3 made in the bottom of the chassis thereof. The said frame 1 is provided bilaterally with racks 7 that mesh with corresponding pinions that are also inserted underneath the vehicle and are powered by an electric motor in such a way as to cause the footboard to project partially or almost fully. The said transiting platform 8 , hinged to the front of the frame 1 , is able to adopt two extreme positions the first, resting on the partially projecting frame, constitutes a step, whilst the second, with the frame almost fully projecting, forms an inclined loading platform that can be positioned on a slant with respect to the frame, the latter, in turn, being automatically inclinable towards the ground level.
