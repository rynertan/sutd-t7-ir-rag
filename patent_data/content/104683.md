# Process for coating an electrically conductive substrate and an aqueous composition containing a cationic binder.

## Abstract
A process is provided for coating an electrically conduc tive substrate with an aqueous coating composition contain ing a cationic binder wherein the binder is obtained by polymerization of 100 parts by weight of a specified monom er mixture in the presence of a specified ethylenically unsaturated polyester resin, the degree of unsaturation being between 0,1 and 5,0 equivalents per 1000 molecular weight units and the maximum degree being dependent on the molecular weight and the weight proportion of the polyester. The invention also pertains to the aqueous coating composition as such.
