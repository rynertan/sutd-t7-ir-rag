# Drill motor assembly with gimbal normality and clamp up capability.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a drilling apparatus 10 having a drilling member 20 that is rotatable about an axis 45 for drilling a bore in a workpiece 12 . The drilling apparatus 10 includes a spindle 22 which drives the drilling member 20 and advances it toward and against the workpiece surface 32 . The gimbal member 18 normalizes the drilling member 20 as the bore is drilled. The gimbal member 18 guides the drilling member 20 toward a drilling point 48 which is positioned on a datum plane 44 that is substantially tangent to the surface of the workpiece 32 . As the bore is drilled, the guiding member 18 guides the drilling member 20 so that the drilling axis 45 remains substantially normal to the drilling point 48 at all times while the bore is drilled.
