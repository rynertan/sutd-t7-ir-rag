# Demand valve for a breathing apparatus.

## Abstract
There is described herein a commutator feeding device for an air distributor, comprising a transducer apt for con trolling the movement of a shutter element for feeding prefixed quantities of air into a chamber 3 of said distrib utor, successive to a pressure variation taking place inside said chamber, said transducer being activated following the shifting of a deformable membrane. The device comprises a spring 15 , disposed inside a small piston 16 , apt for resting on said membrane, said small piston being provided with radial stakes 18 each one of which is apt for resting on the active surface of a corresponding helicoidal profile cam 20 , with manually operable actioning means being predisposed for controlling the rotation of said small piston around its own axis and hence, the axial shifting of the small piston itself, in the spring compressing sense.
