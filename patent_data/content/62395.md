# Bead puzzle.

## Abstract
A puzzle comprises at least two relatively rotatable members 10, 12 in contact with one another and pivoted together about an axis 14 normal to their contact plane. Exterior surfaces of the members are formed with tracks 16A, 16B having their entry and exit points disposed equiangularly about said axis 14 and equidistant there from in said contact plane. Accordingly relative rotation of the members in equi angular steps brings about align ment of the several tracks in different configurations. A multiplicity of movable elements 18 substantially fill the tracks and are displaceable therealong when the tracks in the first member are aligned with those in the second. The puzzle may in its initial position have circu lar tracks each filled with beads of a different colour or marking, the puzzle being manipulated to randomise the beads and then to return them to their original pattern or to form another intended pattern.
