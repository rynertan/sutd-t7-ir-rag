## Description
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic light sensitive material, and more particularly to a silver halide photographic light sensitive material which contains a cyan coupler excellent in the solubility as well as in the dispersion stability and which is capable of giving a satisfactorily color reproducible and well preservable dye image. The formation of a dye image by use of a silver halide color photographic light sensitive material is generally carried out in the manner that an aromatic primary amine color developing agent itself, when reducing the light exposed silver halide particles of a silver halide color photographic light sensitive material, is oxidized, and the oxidized product reacts with a coupler that is in advance contained in the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material to thereby form a dye. And as the coupler, because the color reproduction is usually carried out by the color subtractive process, three different couplers i.e., yellow, magenta and cyan couplers are used. These couplers each is normally dissolved into a substantially water insoluble high boiling organic solvent or at need together with an auxiliary solvent, and the resulting solution is then added to a silver halide emulsion. Fundamental requirements for the nature of these couplers are that the coupler shall Those conventionally known cyan couplers include 2,5 diacylaminophenol type cyan couplers which are phenol compounds the second and fifth positions of which are substituted by acylamino radicals, as described in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 2,985,826, Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection hereinafter referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 112038 1975, 109630 1978 and 163537 1980. When such a 2,5 diacylaminophenol type cyan coupler is used in a silver halide light sensitive material, because of its very small secondary absorption in the spectral wavelength range of from 400 to 450nm, the light sensitive material becomes better in the blue color reproduction as well as in the color restoration cyan dye loss is prevented , and further becomes better improved on the dark discoloration resistance such as the resistance to heat and moisture, so that the light sensitive material can be largely improved on the cyan dye image. However, the use of a 2,5 diacylaminophenol type cyan coupler can not sufficiently satisfy the foregoing fundamental nature requirements because the coupler has the disadvantages that 1 its special minimum density in the wavelength range of from 450 to 480nm is so high and its lightness is so low that its color reproducible range becomes narrow, while its absorption in the wavelength range of from 500 to 550nm is so high that its green color reproduction becomes poor, 2 its resistance to light is insufficient, and 3 its solubility and dispersion ability are unsatisfactory. It is therefore a first object of the present invention to provide a silver halide photographic light sensitive material containing a cyan coupler which is excellent in the spectral absorption characteristic and capable of forming a clear dye image with good color tone in a wide color reproduction range. It is a second object of the present invention to provide a silve halide photographic light sensitive material which is improved so as to have well balanced resistances to light, heat and moisture, and capable of forming a well preservable dye image. It is a third object of the present invention to provide a silver halide photographic light sensitive material containing a cyan coupler which is excellent in the solubility, dispersibility and dispersion stability. We have now found that the above objects of the present invention can be accomplished by a silver halide photographic light sensitive material comprising a support having thereon at least one silver halide emulsion layer containing in combination at least one of those cyan couplers having the following Formula I , 1a or 1b and at least one of those cyan couplers having the following Formula II In the present invention, the alkyl radical represented by R₂ includes those in the straight chain or branched chain form, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and octyl. The preferred cyan couplers having Formula I in the present invention include those compounds having the following Formula III The radical represented by R₈, when the n is equal to 0, is an alkyl and, when the n is equal to or more than 1, is preferred an aryl. The further preferred radical represented by R₈ is a phenyl radical having substituents as, when the n is equal to or more than 1, phenyl or phenyl radical having a single or a plurality of substituents selected from the group of radicals preferably t butyl, t amyl, octyl , alkyl sulfonamido radicals preferably butyl sulfonamido, octyl sulfonamido, dodecyl sulfonamido, aryl sulfonamido radicals preferably phenyl sulfonamido , aminosulfonamido radicals preferably dimethylaminosulfonamido , or alkylcarbonyl radicals preferably methyloxycarbonyl, butyloxycarbonyl . R₉ represents a straight chain or branched chain alkylene radical having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and more preferably from 1 to 12 atoms. Z₃ is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, or a radical that can be split off by the reaction of the coupler with the oxidized product of an aromatic primary amine type color developing agent, the radical being preferably a chlorine atom or a fluorine atom. The following are typical examples of the cyan coupler having Formula I , but the present invention is not limited thereto. The cyan couplers having Formula II are more preferably those compounds having the following Formula IV The Formulas I , II , III and IV , the radicals that can be split off by the reaction of these couplers with the oxidized product of the aromatic primary amine type color developing agents represented by Z₁, Z₂, Z₃ and Z₄ are all known to those skilled in the art. Any of these radicals changes the reactivity of the coupler or is split from the coupler to fulfill its development inhibiting, bleach inhibiting and color compensation functions to thereby advantageously act in the coupler containing layers or other layers of the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material. Typical examples of such radicals include, for example, alkoxy radicals, aryloxy radicals, arylazo radicals, thioether, carbamoyloxy radical, acyloxy radicals, imido radical, sulfonamido radical, thiocyano radical or heterocyclic radicals such as, e.g., oxazolyl, diazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl . The particularly preferred examples represented by Z are a hydrogen atom or a chlorine atom. The following are typical examples of those cyan couplers having Formula II , but the present invention is not limited thereto. In the case of using in combination the cyan coupler having Formula I , Ia and Ib and the cyan coupler having Formula II , there may be used at least one of these cyan couplers having formula I , Ia or Ib and at least one of these cyan couplers having Formula II in an arbitrary proportion in the combination thereof, but it is desirable that of the total amount of the cyan couplers the cyan coupler having Formula I , Ia or Ib be used in the quantity so as to account for from 30 to 90 moles , and more preferably from 50 to 90 mole . The silver halide color photographic light sensitive material of the present invention is allowed to be of any construction as long as it comprises a support having thereon at least one silver halide emulsion layer, and no particular restrictions are placed on the number of and the coating order of silver halide emulsion layers and non light sensitive layers. Typical examples of the light sensitive material include color positive or negative films, color photographic printing papers, color slides, and those light sensitive materials for special use such as for graphic arts use, radiography use, and high resolution applications, and particularly suitable for use as color photographic printing papers. Most of the foregoing silver halide emulsion layers and nonlight sensitive layers are usually comprised of hydrophilic binder containing hydrophilic colloidal layers. As the hydrophilic binder, there may be preferably used gelatin or gelatin derivatives such as acylated gelatin, guanidylated gelatin, carbamylated gelatin, cyanoethanolated gelatin, and esterified gelatin. These cyan couplers having Formulas I , Ia or Ib and II may be incorporated by the application of the method for use in ordinary cyan dye forming couplers thereto into silver halide emulsion layers, the layers being coated on a support, thereby forming a photographic element. The photographic element is allowed to be either a monochromatic element or multicolour element. In the case of the multicolor element, the cyan coupler is usually incorporated into the red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, but may be allowed in a nonlight sensitive emulsion layer or emulsion layer that is sensitive to three primary color regions excluding the red. Each component unit capable of forming a dye image is a single or one of a plurality of emulsion layers, having sensitivity to each given spectral region. The cyan coupler having formula I , Ia , Ib or II may be incorporated into an emulsion in accordance with any of conventionally known methods. For example, the cyan coupler is dissolved separately into such a single high boiling organic solvent as a phthalate dibutyl phthalate , a phosphate tricresyl phosphate or a N,N diaIkyl substituted amide N,N diethyl laurylamide and into such a single low boiling organic solvent as butyl acetate or butyl propionate, or dissolved into, if necessary, a mixture of the high boiling and low boiling organic solvents. After that, the solution is mixed with an aqueous gelatin solution containing a surfactant, and then emulsified to be dispersed by use of a high speed mixer, a colloid mill or a ultrasonic disperser. The resulting dispersed liquid is subsequently added to a silver halide, whereby a silver halide emulsion for use in the present invention can be prepared. The cyan coupler having formula I , Ia , Ib or II may be added to the silver halide emulsion usually within the quantity range of from 0.05 to 2 moles per mole of silver halide, and preferably from 0.1 to 1 mole per mole of silver halide. In the case where the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material of the present invention is a multicolor element, all the layers including the above image forming component unit layers required for the photographic element may be coated in various orders as is known to those skilled in the art. The typical multicolor photographic element is one that comprises a support having thereon a cyan dye image formable component unit consisting of at least one red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a cyan dye forming coupler at least one of the cyan dye forming couplers is the cyan coupler having Formula I and at least further one of the cyan couplers is the cyan coupler having Formula II a magenta dye image formable component unit consisting of at least one green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one magenta dye forming coupler and a yellow dye image formable component unit consisting of at least one blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one yellow dye forming coupler. The photographic element may have additional layers such nonlight sensitive layers as filter layers, interlayers, a protective layer, an antihalation layer, and a subbing layer. As the yellow dye forming coupler there may be suitably used those compounds having the following Formula V Further, particularly preferred as the yellow coupler capable of forming a dye image are those compounds having the following Formula VI These are as described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,778,658, 2,875,057, 2.908,573, 3,227,155, 3,227,550, 2,253,924, 3,265,506, 3,277,155, 3,341,331, 3,369,895, 3,384,657, 3,408,194, 3,415,652, 3,447,928, 3,551,155, 3,582,322, 3,725,072, 3,894,875, West German OLS Patent Nos. 1,547,868, 2,057,941, 2,162,899, 2,163,812, 2,213,461, 2,219,917, 2,261,361, 2,263,875, Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 13576 1974, Japanese Patent O.P.I.

As the magenta dye image forming coupler, there may be preferably used those couplers having the following Formula VII These are as described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 2,600,788, 3,061,432, 3,062,653, 3,217,269, 3,311,476, 3,152,896, 3,419,391, 3,519,429, 3,555,318, 3,684,514, 3,888,680, 3,907,571, 3,928,044, 3,930,861, 3,930,866, 3,933,500, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 29639 1974, 111631 1974, 129538 1974, 13041 1975, 58922 1977, 62454 1980, 118034 1980, 38043 1981, British Patent No. 1,247,493, Belgian Patent Nos. 769,116 and 792,525, West German Patent No. 2,156,111, Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 60479 1971. The following are typical examples of the yellow and magenta dye image forming couplers which are suitably usable in the present invention, but the present invention is not limited thereto. Any of these yellow dye forming couplers and magenta dye forming couplers may be incorporated into a silver halide emulsion layer within the quantity range of from 0.05 to 2 moles per mole of silver halide. For the support of the light sensitive material of the present invention, any of these materials may be used such as, for example, baryta paper, polyethylene coated paper, polypropylene synthetic paper, a transparent support material provided with a reflective layer or material, a glass plate, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, polyester film such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide film, polycarbonate film, and polystyrene film. These support materials may be arbitrarily selected according to the purpose for which is used the silver halide photographic light sensitive material of the present invention. The coating process for use in coating the silver halide emulsion layers and nonlight sensitive layers of the light sensitive material of the present invention includes such various processes as the dipping coating process, air doctor coating process, curtain coating process, and hopper coating process. The silver halide used for the silver halide emulsion includes those arbitrarily used for ordinary silver halide emulsions silver bromide, silver chloride, silver iodobromide, silver chlorobromide, and silver chloroiodobromide. The particles of these silver halides are allowed to be either coarse grained or fine grained, and be of either wide or narrow particle size distribution. The crystal of these silver halide particles may be either regular or twin, and those having an arbitrary proportion of its 100 face to 111 face can be used. Further the crystal structure of these silver halide particles may be either homogeneous from the inside to the outside thereof or heterogeneous between the inside and the outside thereof. Furthermore, these silver halides may be either of the type of forming a latent image mainly on the surface of the particles thereof or of the type of forming it inside the particles thereof. In addition, these silver halides may be prepared by any of the neutral method, ammoniacal method and acid method, and silver halide particles produced by any of the simultaneous mixing method, sequential mixing method and conversion method may be applied. The silver halide emulsion used in the present invention can be chemically sensitized by the single or combined use of sulfur sensitizers such as, e.g., aryl thiocarbamide, thiourea, cystine active or inert selenium sensitizers reduction sensitizers such as, e.g., stannous salts or polyamides noble metallic sensitizers including such gold sensitizers as sodium aurithiocyanate, potassium chloroaurate, 2 aurosulfo benzothiazolemethyl chloride, water soluble salt sensitizers such as of ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, and ammonium chloropalladate, potassium chloropalladate and sodium chloropalladite. Into the silver halide emulsion used in the invention may be incorporated various known photographic additives such as those described in, e.g., Research Disclosure No. 17643, Dec. 1978. The silver halide emulsion used in the invention, in order to be provided with sensitivity to the necessary wavelength region for a red sensitive emulsion, is spectrally sensitized by the addition thereto of an appropriately selected sensitizing dye. As the spectral sensitizer, various sensitizing dyes may be used singly or in combination. Advantageously applicable spectral sensitizers to the invention include such typical cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, and complex cyanine dyes as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,269,234, 2,270,378 2,442,710 and 2,454,620. Other additives may also be arbitrarily incorporated into the silver halide emulsion layers and nonlight sensitive layers of the silver halide photographic light sensitive material of the present invention, the additives including antifoggants, antistain agents, brightening agents, antistatic agents, hardening agents, plasticizers, wetting agents, and ultraviolet absorbing agents, as described in Research Disclosure No. 17643. The thus constructed silver halide photographic light sensitive material of the present invention, after being exposed to light, is then developed by the color development process including various photographic processing procedures. The preferred color developer liquid is one that contains an aromatic primary amine type color developing agent as the principal component thereof, the color developing agent being typified by p phenylenediamine type compounds including, for example, diethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, monomethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, dimethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, 2 amino 5 diethylaminotoluene hydrochloride, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N dodecylamino toluene, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N β methanesulfonamidoethyl aminotoluene sulfate,4 N ethyl N β methanesulfonamidoethylamino aniline, 4 N ethyl N β hydroxyethylamino aniline, and 2 amino 5 N ethyl β methoxyethyl aminotoluene. These color developing agents may be used singly or in combination, or used together with hydroquinone. Further, the color developer liquid contains generally alkali agents such as sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or sodium sulfite, and may also contain various additives including such halogenated alkaline metals as, e.g., potassium bromide, and development control agents such as, e.g., hydrazinic acid. The silver halide photographic light sensitive material of the present invention may contain in the hydrophilic colloidal layers thereof the foregoing color developing agent as it is or in the form of the precursor thereof. The color developing agent precursor is a compound capable of producing a color developing agent under an alkaline condition, the precursor including aromatic aldehyde derivative Schiff s base type precursors, multivalent metallic ion complex precursors, phthalic acid imide derivative precursors, phosphoric acid imide derivation precursors, sugar amine reaction product precursors and urethane type precursors. These aromatic primary amine color developing agent precursors are, as described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,342,599, 2,507,114, 2,695,234, 3,719,492, British Patent No. 803,783, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 135628 1978 and 79035 1979, and Research Disclosure Nos. 15,159, 12,146 and 13,924. Any of these aromatic primary amine color developing agents of precursors thereof should be added in a quantity enough to obtain a sufficient color formation during the development process. The quantity largely differs according to the kind of the light sensitive material used, but is used within the range of from 0.1 mole to 5 moles, and preferably from 0.5 mole to 3 moles per mole of light sensitive silver halide. These color developing agents or precursors may be used singly or in combination. Into the photographic light sensitive material may be incorporated any of the foregoing compounds in the form of a solution of it dissolved into an appropriate solvent such as water, methanol, ethanol or acetone, or in the form of a dispersed liquid of it with use of a high boiling organic solvent such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, or tricresyl phosphate, or in the form of it impregnated into a latex polymer as described in Research Disclosure No. 14850. The silver halide photographic light sensitive material of the present invention, after color development, is usually subjected to a bleach fix bath processing or to separate bleaching and fixing treatments and then washed in water. As the bleaching agent, there may be used many compounds, among which multivalent metallic compounds such as of iron III , cobalt III , and tin II , especially complex salts of these metallic cations with organic acids, such as, for example, metallic complex salts, ferricyanates or dichromates of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, aminopolycarboxylic acids such as N hydroxyethyl ethylenediaminediacetic acid, malonic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, diglycolic acid, and dithioglycolic acid, may be used singly or in combination. According to the silver halide photographic light sensitive material of the present invention, the solubility, dispersibility and dispersion stability of the cyan coupler contained in the silver halide emulsion layer are so good that no such a trouble as deposition of the coupler will occur. The cyan coupler is excellent in the spectral absorbing characteristic as well as in the color tone and capable of forming a clear dye image in an extensive color reproduction range particularly a cyan dye image having the maximum absorption in the wavelength range of from 640 to 660nm and having little or no absorption in the regions of from 400 to 450nm, from 450 to 480nm, and from 500 to 550nm, so that the coupler produces very excellent blue and green color reproductions with very satisfactory lightness with no trouble at all. Besides, the formed dye image is also excellent in the resistance to light, heat and moisture as well as in its preservability. The present invention will be illustrated further in detail in reference to examples below, but embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto. The cyan couplers of formula I and II given in Table 1 and the following comparative couplers were used and 10g of each of these couplers was added to a mixture of 5ml of dibutyl phthalate with 30ml of ethyl acetate, and completely dissolved by heating to 60 C. This solution was mixed with 5ml of an aqueous 10 solution of Alkanol B alkyl naphthalenesulfonate, manufactured by DuPont and 200ml of an aqueous 5 gelatin solution, and this mixture was emulsified by means of a colloid mill to prepare a coupler dispersed liquid. The thus dispersed liquids each was added to 500g of a silver chlorobromide containing 80 mole silver bromide emulsion, and the resulting emulsion was coated on a polyethylene coated paper support and then dried, whereby 13 different monochromatic photographic elements were prepared These samples were exposed through an optical wedge to light and subsequently processed in the baths given below in accordance with the following steps The thus processed samples each was tested for the spectral reflection characteristics and preservability thereof in the following manners Spectral reflection characteristics tests The results obtained in i v are given together in Table 1. As apparent from the results shown in Table 1, the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material samples of the present invention have little undesirable absorptions in 550nm and 420nm and low reflection minimum densities as compared to the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material samples containing compounds having Formula I alone, thus resulting in the formation of a dye image having a high lightness and satisfactory spectral reflection characteristics. This is quite an unexpected multiplied effect obtained due to the use of the cyan couplers having Formula II . And the formed dye image displays very satisfactory results in respect of the resistance to light and dark stability. The cyan couplers of formula I and II and the comparative couplers shown in Table 1 were used, and 0.1 mole of each of the couplers was added to and dissolved by heating to 60 C into a mixture liquid of 20ml of dibutyl phthalate and ethyl acetate. The necessary quantity of the ethyl acetate for the dissolution was measured. The results are as shown in Table 2. The thus obtained coupler solutions each was then mixed with the same aqueous Alkanol B solution as in Example 1 and an aqueous gelatin solution, and the mixture was emulsified by means of a colloid mill to thereby prepare a coupler dispersed liquid. The coupler dispersed liquid was subsequently added to 1000 ml of a red sensitive silver chlorobromide emulsion containing 70 mole of silver bromide containing photographic additives such as a hardening agent, coating aid, whereby a coating liquid for making a red sensitive emulsion layer. These coupler dispersed liquid containing silver halide emulsion coating liquids each, being kept at a temperature of 40 C, was flowed at a rate of 2 liters per minute for 48 hours through stainless tubing with its internal diameter of 5 cm by use of a circulation pump, and the time of a deposit beginning to attach to the inside wall of the tubing and the attached quantity of the deposit two days later were measured. The obtained results are as given in Table 2. As apparent from the results shown in Table 2, the cyan couplers are very excellent in the solubility, dispersibility and dispersion stability. The following layers were coated on a polyethylene coated paper support in the described order from the support sidee to thereby prepare multicolor photographic element samples. A yellow coupler containing blue sensitive silver halide emulsion a silver chlorobromide emulsion containing 90 mole of silver bromide and 300 g of gelatin per mole of silver halide and also containing 0.5 mole per mole of silver halide of an yellow coupler YC 1 dissolved into dibutyl phthalate and dispersed into the emulsion is coated so that the coating quantity of gelatin is 2 g m², and then dried. A first interlayer a gelatin layer of 1.5 g of gelatin m² . A magenta coupler containing green sensitive silver halide emulsion a silver chlorobromide emulsion containing 80 mole of silver bromide and 400 g of gelatin per mole of silver halide and also containing 0.3 mole per mole of silver halide of the following magenta coupler MC 1 dissolved into dibutyl phthalate and dispersed into the emulsion is coated so that the coating quantity of gelatin is 2 g m², and then dried. An ultraviolet absorbing agent containing second interlayer containing the following ultraviolet absorbing agent UV 1 a solution of the agent dissolved into 20 g of dibutyl phthalate is dispersed into gelatin, and the dispersed liquid is coated so that the coating quantity of the agent is 0.6 g m² and that of gelatin is 1.5 g m², and then dried. . Cyan coupler containing red sensitive silver halide emulsions silver chlorobromide emulsion containing 80 mole of silver bromide and 300 g of gelatin per mole of silver halide, into parts of which emulsion are dispersed separately dibutyl phthalate solutions of exemplified couplers having Formula I and II , respectively, and into the other parts of which emulsion are dispersed separately the same comparative couplers 1 and 2 as in Example 1, respectively, the individual quantities of the respective couplers are given in mole to the total amount of all the cyan couplers in Table 3 , the emulsions containing 0.4 mole per mole of silver halide of the above couplers, respectively each is coated so that the coating quantity of gelatin is 20 g m², and then dried. A protective layer a gelatin layer of 1.5 g of gelatin m² . The thus prepared samples 29 42 each was exposed to blue, green, and red lights through a wedge by use of a sensitometer Model KS 7, manufactured by Konishiroku Photo Ind. Co., Ltd. , and then processed in the following baths in accordance with the processing steps given below The thus processed samples were tested for the evaluation of the color reproducible region thereof and for the dye image preservability thereof. In accordance with the method for representing colors by the L , u and v systems specified by the Japanese Industrial Standard JIS Z 8729 1980, a chromaticity diagram of u and v , when L is equal to 50, was prepared for each of the samples to thereby evaluate the color reproducible region as integrated value from the relative areas formed by the yellow, magenta and cyan dyes. Further, the color area formed by the formed cyan and magenta dyes was regarded as the blue reproduced region, the color area formed by the formed cyan and yellow dyes as the green reproduced region, and the color area formed by the formed magenta and yellow dyes as the red reproduced region, and these respective color reproduced regions were evaluated from the relative areas thereof. The formed yellow Y , magenta M and cyan C dye images were tested for the light stability and the dark stability in the same manners as in Example 1. The results obtained from the above tests are as given together in Table 3. As apparent from Table 3, the multicolor photographic elements which use the cyan couplers of formula I and II show much improved blue color reproductions with clear dye images formed in a wide color reproduction region without any adverse effect on the green color reproduction, and further show well balanced degree of cyan magenta yellow discoloration, thus showing much improved dye image stability on the whole. Monochromatic photographic element samples were prepared in the same manners as in previous examples with the exception that Exemplified Couplers I 16, II 4 and II 5 were used in place of the I 5, II 3 and II 1, respectively, and Comparative Couplers 4, 5 and 6 in place of the Comparative Couplers 1, 2 and 3. The thus obtained different samples were used for the same tests as in Example 1. As a result, the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material samples of the present invention have less undesirable absorptions in 550 nm and 420 nm and lower reflection minimum densities than do the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material samples containing those of Formula I alone, so that the samples of the present invention form high lightness and satisfactory spectral reflection characteristics having dye images. And the formed dye images display very satisfactory light stability and dark stability characteristics. Similar multicolor photographic element samples to the multicolor photographic element samples of Example 3 were prepared in the same manners as in Example 3 with the exception that the exemplified couplers were replaced by those used In Example 4, respectively, and the YC 1, MC 1 and UV 1 were replaced by the following YC 2, MC 2 and UV 2, respectively. The thus obtained different samples were subjected to the same tests as in Example 3. As a result, the samples containing cyan couplers of formula I and II show improved red, green and blue color reproductions, particularly the conspicuous improvement on the blue color reproduction, with clear dye image formed in a wide color reproduction region, and also show well balanced degree of cyan magenta yellow discoloration, thus showing much improved image preservability on the whole.
