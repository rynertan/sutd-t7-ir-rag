# Method for producing glass preform for optical fiber.

## Abstract
A method for producing a glass preform 1 for an optical fiber comprising forming a fine glass particle mass 1 by flame hydrolysis of a glass raw material, dehydrating the fine glass particle mass 1 in an oxygen atmosphere containing chlorine or a chlorine containing compound at such temper ature that the soot preform 1 is not considerably shrunk and heating the soot preform at a temperature at which the soot preform is sintered and made transparent, the glass preform 1 produced by which method contains less hydroxyl groups, structural defects and an optical fiber fabricated from said glass preform 1 has stable light transmission characteristics for a long time.
