# 3 Allyl 7,8 dihydroxy 6 halo 1 4 hydroxyphenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 3 benzazepine derivatives, process for preparing them and compositions containing them.

## Abstract
The invention provides 3 allyl 7,8 dihydroxy 6 halo 1 4 hydroxyphenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 3 benzazepine derivatives, O alkanoyl esters thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of these compounds. These compounds have a unique cardiovascular effect in that they are potent renal vasodilators and also induce bradycardia. The invention therefore includes pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds. The compounds of the invention can be prepared by reacting an appropriate ether of the desired compound in which all three hydroxy groups are etherified, with an ether cleaving agent, with optional subsequent O acylation and or salt formation.
