# Mechanism for raising and lowering a seat for handicapped persons.

## Abstract
A mechanism for raising and lowering a seat, especially designed for handicapped persons, comprises two supporting arms A , B which have one end coupled to the seat E at the front and rear edges respectively of the seat. At their other ends, the supporting arms A , B cooperate with respective fixed points 1 , 2 . At least one of the supporting arms is cou pled to a driving member and the two supporting arms A , B are interconnected at a point between their ends. With a view to obtaining a compact but stable mechanism guiding the seat in a physiologically correct path of movement during its raising and lowering, the supporting arms A , B have a direct pivotal interconnection D , and one B of the supporting arms is connected to the associated fixed point 2 by a radius arm F .
