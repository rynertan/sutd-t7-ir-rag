## Description
METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PERTUSSIS COMPONENT VACCINE AND COSSINED VACCINE OF PERTUSSIS NTICCN, DIPHTHERIA TOXOID AND TETANUS TOXOID The present invention relates to a method for the production of a pertussis component vaccine and a combined vaccine of pertussis antigen, diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid.More particularly, it relates to an improved method for the production of a pertussis component vaccine by mixing a highly purified F HA Filamentous Hemagglutinirx or a toxoid thereof which is obtained from a culture of Boretella pertussis by a specific method as described hereinafter and a highly purified toxoid of LPF HA Leucocytosis Promoting Factor Hemagglutinin which is obtained from a culture of B. pertussis by a known method or a specific method as described hereinafter, and to a combined vaccine of pertussis antigen, diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid wherein the above improved pertussis component vaccine is used as the pertussis antigen component. Pertussis is one of the infectious diseases and appears frequently in babies and children and hence is very important disease in view of public health. Particularly, babies suffered from this disease occasionally show very heavy symptom and sometimes result in death. It is well known that this disease can be protected by a previous vaccination, and for such a purpose, there is widely used an inactivated vaccine prepared from whole cells of B. pertussis phase I. However, the inactivated vaccine containing whole cells has significant side reaction, and hence, inoculation of vaccine had been prohibited temporarily in the past The disease in babies and children caused by B. pertussis is still one of the most important social problems, and hence, it has been required to develop pertussis vaccine with no side reaction. Sato et al. had succeeded in the production of precipitated purified pertussis vaccine which is an epochal component vaccine and had been found based on basic study on protective antigens cf. Japanese Patent Publication No. 5203 f982 . This vaccine comprises mainly as the protective antigens HA fraction containing F HA and LPF HA and shows excellent protective effect with little side reaction such as fever, and hence, it has already practically been used. This precipitated pertussis vaccine is prepared b inoculating B. pertussis phase I in an appropriate medium, subjecting it to a static culture at about 350C for 5 days, centrifuging the culture broth, separating the supernatant fluid, adding ammonium sulfate to the supernatant fluid so as to become about 50 saturation or adding alcohol thereto, separating the resulting precipitates by centrifuging at 10,000 r.p.m. for 30 minutes, extracting the precipitates with a buffer supplemented with sodium chloride, subjecting the extract to a sucrose density gradient centrifugation in a usual manner to collect the pertussis HA fraction and remove endotoxin fraction, and then treating the resulting HA fraction with formalin to make detoxification. This vaccine is called as a component vaccine cf.Sato Y., et all The Lancet , 122 i26 1984 . However, as is seen in this iiterature, it contains F HA and LPF HA as the main pertussis vaccine component as well as other components. Moreover, it is recognized that the amount of such components can not freely be controlled, and hence it should rather be called as acellular vaccine The vaccine prepared by the Sato et al. is further mixed with diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid, and optionally treated with an aluminum adjuvant and further mixed with a stabilizer such as gelatin, glucose, etc. to obtain precipitated purified pertussis antigens, diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid.Recently, however, there have been issued various clinical reports of topical reactions such as redness, swelling, induration, etc., and hence the vaccine is not necessarily complete. Furthermore, there has been noticed the role of F ER and LPF HA which are produced by B. pertussis phase I strain as an infection protecting antigen, and the important role has been reported in various literatures cf. Sato, Y . et awl Infect. Immun., 31, 1223 1231 1981 Sator Y. et al. Seminars in Infectious Diseases IV, Bacterial Vaccine, 380 385 1982 . In order to use the F HA and LPF HA as the component of pertussis vaccine without undesirable side effect such as local reactions, it is important to highly purify them, and further, it is also important to be able to be produced simply and in a large quantity for the purpose of producing the antigen in an amount sufficient to use as G vaccine. It is known that F HA can be isolated and purified by subjecting the supernatant of B. pertussis culture to fractionation with ammonium sulfate, subjecting the resultant to a sucrose density gradient centrifugation, followed by gel filtration twice cf. Sato, Y. et al. Infect. Immun., 9, 801 1974 1. However, this method recuires a plenty of steps and hence is very complicated, and further gives the desired F HA only in a low yield, and hence, this method can not be used in an inaustral scale. It is also known to purify B. pertussis F HA by an ion exchange chromatography and a gel filtration cf. Ssai, H. et al. Infect. Immun., 25, 460 1979 . However, according to this method, the desired F HA is obtained only in a low yield, and further, it is very difficult to remove undesirable B. pertussis endotoxin, and hence, this method can not practically be used, either. Other known methods are a combination of hydroxyapatite adsorption chromatography, haptoglobin affinity chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and gel filtration cf. Cowell, J. L. et al. Seminars in InfectiousDiseases IV, Bacterial Vaccine, 37, 1 1982 . However, this method requires a plenty of steps and hence is complicated, and further, the F HA is obtained only in a low yield. Besides, the used hydroxyapatite is very expensive. From these many drawbacks, the above methods are not suitable for producing F HA in an industrial scale. There have also been known some methods for the separation and purification of LPF HA, for instance, a method comprising salting out a culture medium of B.pertussis with ammonium sulfate, extracting and analyzing, and then subjecting the thus obtained material to ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration cf. Arai, i. et al. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 444, 765 1976 or a method by sucrose concentration gradient centrifugation cf.Sato, Y. et al. Infect. Immun., 6, 897 704 1972 .According to such known methods, however, it is very hard to obtain the desired LPF HA which shows single band in the purification analysis by electrophoresis, and its yield is very low. In order to obtain the desired highly pure LPF FA in a comparatively large amount, it is also proposed that a supernatant of culture media of B. pertussis is passed through a column packed with hydroxyapatite to adsorb LPF HA thereon, followed by washing, eluting and then subjecting to affinity chromatography with concanavalin A Sepharose ConA Sepharose, manufactured by Pharmacia cf. Yajima, M. et al. J. Biochem., 83, 295 303 1978 . However, the affinity chromatography using concanavalin A as a ligand not only has an affinity with LPF HA but also can adsorb saccharides, glycolipids and also other glycoproteins, and hence, it adsorbs other pertussis cell components such as cell membrane components, which results in difficulty of Isolation of the desired highly pure LPF HA.Moreover, the treatment with a column of hydroxyapatite takes a long time, which may result in lowering of LPF HA activity, and further, because of expense of hydroxyapatite, the desiredLPF HA is hardly obtainable in a low cost in an industrial scale. Thus, it is not suitable as an affinity chromatography for LPF HA. Since it has recently been found that human hapto globin binds specifically to LPF HA, it has been tried to purify LPF HA by an affinity chromatography using as a ligand the human haptoglobin instead of the above concanavalin cf. Irons, L. et al. Biochimica et BiophisicaActa, 580, 175 185 1979 , and Cowell, J. et al. Seminars in Infectious Diseases IV, Bacterial Vaccine, 371 379 1982 . There has also been proposed a method for collecting LPF HA which comprises fracturing mechanically B.pertussis cells, extracting LPF HA from the cell components, subjecting it to ammonium sulfate fractionation, and then, subjecting the thus obtained material to affinity chromatography using as a ligand plasma sialoproteins such as haptoglobin or ceruloplasmin, or sialoproteins such as salivary mucin cf. British Patent First Publication 2,015,531 . These methods by affinity chromatography using as a ligand haptoglobin, etc. are expected as an industrial method for producing a purified LPF HA. Thus, there is never known any method for the production of F HA having satisfactory purity in an industrial scale, and as to LPF EA, only the above method by affinity chromatography using as a ligand haptoglobin is known as an industrially acceptable method. An object or the present invention is to provide an improved industrial method for producing a pertussis component vaccine which does not show undesirable side effect by using highly purified F HA and LPF HA. Another object of the invention is to provide a method for producing a combined vaccine of pertussis antigen, diphtheria toxoid and tetanus tooid by using the pertussis component vaccine. The pertussis component vaccine of the present invention is produced by mixing a highly purified F HA which is obtained by the steps of treating a culture of B. pertussis with a cellulose sultate gel, a polysaccharide gel chemically bound with dextran sulfate, or a crosslinked polysaccharide sulfate gel, thereby adsorbing F HA on the gel, and then eluting F HA from the gel, with a highly purified LPF HA which is obtained by affinity chromatography using as a ligand haptoglobin as disclosed in GB A 2,015,531 or by an improved method found by some of the present inventors as described hereinafter.The combined vaccine of the present invention can be prepared by mixing the above pertussis component vaccine with diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid. The desired highly purified F HA is prepared by the following methods, which are described in JapanesePatent Application Nos. 75314 1984, 84778 1984 and 91631 1984. That is, B. pertussis is cultured in a conventional medium, such as Cohen Wheeler medium or StainerScholte medium, in a usual manner, such as stationary culture, shake culture, or spinner culture this is synonym of shaking culture, aeration culture, and aeratIon spinner culture . The culture broth thus obtained is subjected to centrifugation to remove the cells and the supernatant is separated out. Alternatively, the cells are fractured and thereafter the mixture is subjected to. centrifugation and the supernatant is separated out. The supernatant is subjected to the specific purification by gel adsorption chromatography as it stands or after partially purified by a conventional method.The previous purification such as salting out, extraction, ultracentrifugation, etc. is not necessarily applied, but the supernatant can be directly subjected to chromatography with cellulose sulfate gel, a polysaccharide gel chemically bound with dextrane sulfate, or a crosslinked polysaccharide sulfate gel, and hence, the purification can be done in a simple step. The sulfuric acid ester of cellulose used as the cellulose sulfate gel in the present invention is obtained by sulfating a cellulose, preferably a crystalline cellulose or cellulose having crystalline area and non crystalliije area. The sulfuric acid ester of cellulose thus obtained retains well the original shape preferably spherical shape of the starting material and is insoluble in an aqueous medium and has excellent physical stability, and hence, is suitable as a gel of chromatography. These starting celluloses are commercially available, for example, Abicel manufactured by Asahi Kasci, Japan , Cellulofine GC 15,GH 25, GC 100, or GC 200 manufactured by Chisso Corp.,Japan .The sulfation of the cellulose can be carriea out by a conventional method, for example, by treating a gel of cellulose with chlorosulfonic acid, anhydrous sulfuric acid, or other sulfating agent in an organic solvent e.g.pyridine . The polysaccharide gel chemically bound with aextran sulfate is produced by chemically binding a dextran sulfate to a polysaccharide gel derivative. Various products of the dextran sulfate are commercially available, among which the products used usually for biological purposes are preferably used. The polysaccharide gel derivative includes gel derivatives which are prepared by subjecting a polysaccharide e.g. agarose, dextran, cellulose, etc. to conventional treatments for giving properties suitable for using as a carrier for chromatography, such as crystallization purification treatment, three dimensional crosslinking, molding, etc. These products are also commercially available and include, for example, an agarose gel such as Sepharose manufactured by Pharmacia, Sweden , a dextran gel such as Sephadex manufactured by Pharmacia , a cellulose gel such as Abicel manufactured by Asahi Kasei, Japan . The chemical binding of the dextran sulfate and che polysaccharide can be done b various methods, for example, by a method of Anderson et al. using cyanobromide cf. Japanese Patent First PublicationNo. 114018 1977 , or a method using cyanobromide and also lysine as a spacer cf. Bryan M. Turner et a l. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 659, 7 14 1981 . One product of dextran sulfate agarose gel is already on the market, for example, Dextrane sulfate Sepharose CL 4B manufactured byPharmacia . The sulfuric acid ester of a crosslinked polysaccharine includes a sulfuric acid ester of polysaccharides, such as dextran, celluloses, agarose, which is crosslinked with a crosslinking agent, such as epichlorohydrin, dichlorohydrin, dibrcmohydrin, ethylene glycol bisepoxypropyl ether. The crosslinked polysaccharides are commercially available, for example, crosslinked dextrans such as Sephadex G 10, G 25, G 50, and G 100 manufactured by Pharmacia, Sweden , crosslinked agaroses such asSepharose CL 2B, CL 4B, and CL 6B manufactured DyPharmacia , and crosslinked celluloses such as CellulofineGCL 25, GCL 90 manufactured by Chisso Corp., Japan .The sulfation of the crosslinked polysaccharide can be carried out by a conventional method, for example, by treating a gei of the crosslinked polysaccharide with chlorosulfonic acid, anhydrous sulfuric acid, or other sulfating agent in an organic solvent e.g. pyridine . The isolation and purification of F HA from a culture of B. pertussis with these gels are carried out in the following manner. The cellulose sulfate gel, dextran sulfate polysaccharide gel and crosslinked polysaccharide sulfate gel are previously equilibrated with an appropriate buffer having a neutral pH e.g. pH 6 9 , a specific conductivity of about 5 to 25 mS cm, such as 0.2 M soaium chloride added 0.01H phosphase buffer, and then used for adsorption ofF HA mS cm Millisiemens pro cm . The purification treatments such as adsorption of F A onto the cellulose sulfate gel or other gels, washing of the gels adsorbing the F HA and elution of the F HA can be carried out by a conventional industrially employed operation such as batch method or column method. In case of batch method, the cellulose sulfate gel or other gels are added to culture of B. pertussis, and the mixture is gently stirred at pH 6.0 9.0, at a temperature of 0 300C for 10 to 60 minutes, whereby F HA is adsorbed onto the gels. The culture of B. pertussis used in the above method is usually regulated to a specific conductivity in the range of 5.0 to 25.0 ms cm by concentrating or diluting it. A supernatant of the culture solution may also be used as it stands, when it has the specific conductivity range as mentioned above. After completion cf adsorption, the culture gel mixture is added onto a filter, and the gel is separated from the filtrate by suction. The separated gel is washed by suction with an appropriate buffer having a specific con ductivity of about 5 to 25 mS cm and a pH of about 5.0 to 10.0, for example, 0.2 Al sodium chloride added 0.02 MMcIlvaine s buffer, 0.2 M sodium chloride added 0.01 M phosphate buffer, or 0.2 M sodium chloride added 0.01 MTris HC1 buffer, etc.Thereafter, the adsorbed F HA is eluted with an appropriate buffer having a pH of about 5.0 to 10.0 and a specific conductivity of about 25 to 130 mS cm larger specific conductivity than that or the above buffer for washing , such as, for example, 1.5 M sodium chlorideadded McIlvaine s buffer, 1.5 M sodium chloride added phosphate buffer, etc. In case of column method, the starting solution to be treated, the buffer for washing and the buffer for elution are the same as those used in the batch method as mentioned above. The speed of passing the solution is controlled in the range of about 10 ml cm2 hour to 500 ml cm2 hour. According to the above purification method, theF HA in the culture of B. pertussis is specifically remarkably adsorbed, and hence, the purification degree of F HA becomes several ten folds and further the recovery rate ofF HA reaches to more than 75 , in some conditions, to from more than 90 to almost 100 . Beside, the purified F HA has so high specific activity as about 3.7 11 x 104 HA unit mg protein, usually 4 8 x 104 HA unit mg protein measured by a chicken blood cell ayglutination test, cf. Sato, Y. et al. Infect. Immun., 7, 929 999 1973 , and when it is shown in ELISA activity, it has 0.9 1.3 xF HA Ab ELISA unit mg protein measured by F HA. ELISA method, cf. Sato, Y. et al. Infect. Immun., 41, 313 320 1983 , and further, forms a single band in a polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis analysis pH 4.5 , andB. pertussis endotoxin is almost completely removed. According to the above purification method, the desired F HA can be isolated from the starting culture of B.pertussis in a high yield and high purity with very simple operation. Besides, the chromatography adsorbent can be prepared in a low cost and also can be used repeatedly without deterioration. Accordingly, the method is excellent from economical viewpoint. Thus, the above purification method is very excellent as an industrial method for product tion of a highly purified F HA. If necessary, the purification may be combined with conventional purification methods, such as sucrose density gradient ultracentrirugation, ion exchange chromatography, etc. The purified F HA thus obtained is very pure and hence can be used as a starting material for producing the final vaccine as it stands, but may optionally be used after being converted into a toxoid by a conventional method using formalin. The purified LPF HA may be obtained by the method as disclosed in GB A 2,015,531 but is preferably prepared by the following purification method. Cne method is as follows cf. Japanese PatentApplication No. 206598 1983, U.S. Serial No. 666,172 . The starting culture medium obtained by culturingB. pertussis in a usual manner is subjected to an affinity chromatography using a denatured ceruloplasmin as a ligand, whereby the endotoxins of B. pertussis are removed off during the purification of LPF HA to give a highly purifiedLPF HA in a high yield. The denatured ceruloplasmin used in the prFfFca tion is obtained by denaturing ceruloplasmin of animal origin by various methods, for example, by heating ceruloplasmin at 60 to 85 C for 1 to 24 hours, or by treating ceruloplasmin with a denaturing agent, such as a sulfide e.g. sodium sulfide, ammonium sulfide, etc. , L ascorbic acid, a reducing sugar e.g. D glucose,D galactose, D mannose, D fructose, maltose, lactose, etc. , a reducing agent e.g. acetaldehyde, formic acid, oxalic acid, mercaptoethanol, diethyldithiocarbamate, etc. , a cyano compound e.g. sodium cyanide, sodium thiocyanate, potassium thiocyanate, etc. , a chelating agent e.g. EDTA, nitrotriacetic acid NTA , triethylenetetramine hexascetic acid TTHA , etc. , whereby the copper ion Cu contained in ceruloplasmin is reduced or a part or whole of the copper ion is isolated and removed. The above denaturing means may be applied to alone or in combination of two or more, and the denaturing may be applied to after immobilizing ceruloplasmin i.e, a ligand into a matrix i.e a suppoting carrier . The denaturing can easily be carried out by dialyzing one volume of a 0.1 to 0.5 w v solution ot ceruloplasmin in physiological saline solution against 10 to 200 volume of the following butter. That is, in case of using sodium sulfide, anirnonium sulfide, or sodium cyanide as the denaturing agent, a 0.01 to 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 0.01 to 1.0 M of the denaturing agent pH 6.0 8.0 is used, and the dialysis is carried out at 0 to 600C for 1 to 10 hours.In case of using L ascorbic acid or ruducing sugars as the denaturing agent, a 0.01 to 0.1 M acetate buffer containing 0.01 to 1.0M of the denaturing agent pH 4,0 6.0 is used, and the dialysis is carried out at 0 to 150C for 24 to 36 hours. In case of using acetaldehyde, formic acid, oxalic acid, mercaptoethanol, diethyldithiocarbamate, or the like as the denaturing agent, a 0.01 to 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 0.01 to 0.1 M of the denaturing agent pE u.0 8.0 is used, and the dialysis is carried out at O to 300C for 0.5 to 3 hours.In case of using thiocyanates as the denaturing agent, 0.01 to 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 0.1 to 3.0 M of the denaturing agent pH 6.0 8.0 is used, and the dialysis is carried out at 0 to 300C for 0.5 to 5.0 hours. In case of using EDTA, NTA, TTHA as the denaturing agent, a 0.01 to 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 0.01 to 1.0 M of the denaturing agent pH 6.0 8.0 is used, and the dialysis is carried out at O to 30 C for 0.5 to 5.0 hours. The starting ceruloplasmin is commercally available, or may be obtained by subjecting blood plasma to alcohol fractionation by Cohn method as Fraction IV, or may be obtained by separating from human or other animals blood and then purifying. The affinity chromatography of culture media of B.pertussis with the above denatured ceruloplasmin is usually carried out in the following manner. An affinity gel is prepared by the method of Axe n et al. lcf. Axewn et al. Nature, 214, 1302 i304 1967 , i.e. by immobilizing the denatured ceruloplasmin into a matrix of cepharose, agarose, cellulose, or dextran, etc.which are activated with cyano bromide. The affinity gel is contacted with the culture media of B. pertussis in column method or batch system, whereby LPF HA contained in the media is adsorbed onto the gel, followed by washing the gel with an appropriate buffer to remove contaminants and ten eluding LPF HA with an eluent. The starting culture media of B pertussis include the same as used for the purification of F HA as mentioned hereinbefore, for example, culture media obtained by culturing B. pertussis phase I strain in a conventional liquid medium, such as Cohen Wheeler medium or StainerScholte medium, in a usual manner, such as stationary culture, shake culture, or spinner culture. Preferably, the culture media are subjected to centrifugation or filtration in order to remove cells. Besides, the solution passed through in the purification of F HA as disclosed hereinbefore may also be used as the starting material.According to this purification method of LPF HA, the culture can be applied to the affinity chromÅatographs as they stand, i.e. without subjecting to various pre treatmerits such as salting out, extracting, dialysis, ultracentrifugation, concentration, equilibration, or the like, and hence, the procedure is very simple. According to a column method, the affinity gel is packed into a column, and the starting culture medium of B.pertussis is passed through the column at G flow rate of 10 ml cm2 hour to 500 ml cm2 hour. According to a batch method, the culture medium ofB. pertussis is entered into a vessel, and thereto is directly added the affinity gel, and the mixture is stirred for about 30 minutes to about 3 hours, preferably for about one hour. The amount of the affinity gel is not critical, but usually, 0.1 ml of affinity gel is used for adsorbing 10,000 to 20,000 fug of LPF HA in protein amount . Washing of the LPF HA adsorbed affinity gel is usually carried out with a bufrer having a pH a.o 9.0 and a specific conductivity of 10 to 150 mS cm. For example, by using a 0.01 to 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.0 8.0 containing 0.1 to 1.0 M sodium chloride, the washing is carried out by flowing the buffer in a volume of several tens to 100 times as much as the volume of the column in case of the column method, or by treating with the buffer in a volume of several to several hundreds times as much as the volume of gel in the batch method. By the washing, endotoxin of B. pertussis contained in the starting material is effectively removed. This is also one of the characteristics of the purification jttethod, which is superior to the conventional purification methods. After the above washing step, the LPF HA adsorbed onto the ligand is eluted in a usual manner by using conventional eluents, such as chaotropic salts e.g. salts which can release chaotropic ions such as I , Cm04 , CF3COO , SCN , CCl3COO , etc. , ethylene glycol, dioxane, urea, guanidine hydrochloride, EDTA, or the like. According to the affinity chromatograpy of this method, the desired product can be obtained in a high yield such as more than 90 in case of the starting material having a pH 4.0 to 10.0. The LPF HA obtained by the above method has a high purity as more than 90 , occasionally more than 95 in the analysis by electrophoresis, pH 4.5 . Besides, the product has a specific activity of 0.9 1.6 x. 1C5 LPF HpELISA uniting of protein, usually 1.1 1.2 x 105 LPF HpELISA unit mg of protein measured by ELISA analysis, cf. Sato et al. Symposium on Toxins, Proceeding of the 28thSymposium on Toxins, 141 144 1981 , which can not be achieved by the conventional purification methods.Superiority of the product is also clear from the results in biological activities tests of the LPF HA product, such asLimurus test and pyrogen test in rabbit. That is, in case of this purification method, the undesirable endotoxin is almost completely removed. Besides, the above method has an advantage that there can be avoided the problems such as hepatitis virus and other infectious factors which are observed in case of using human blood plasma components. For instance, in case of using a ceruloplasmin denatured by heat treatment, the specific adsorbability ofLPF HA and capacity of the adsorption are significantly enhanced, and further, the hepatitis virus or the like is effectively rerncvea. Moreover, in case of using as the ligand a ceruloplasmin denatured by l ascorbic acid, sodium cyanide etc., even if the denatured ceruloplasmin is heat treated at 600C for 10 15 hours, the gel can show sufficient purification capacity as like as the product not subjected to the heat treatment. Besides, even when a ceruloplasmin subjected to heat treatment at 600C for 10 hours is further treated with a denaturing agent e.g.l ascorbic acid or sodium cyanide , the denatured product can show the same or more properties as the product denatured with the denaturing agent without subjecting to the heat treatment. Thus, the above method is also excellent in view of no danger of contamination of hepatitis virus or the like and further sufficient removal of endo toxin of B. pertussis. The affinity chromatography wherein the denatured ceruloplasmin as obtained above is used as the ligand can give the desired LPF HA in a high yield and high purity from the starting culture medium of B. pertussis by a simple procedure. Besides, the affinity gel can repeatedly be used for several tens to several hundreds of times or more, which is advantageous in view of low cost. The method of the present invention is also advantageous in that endotoxin ofB. pertussis can almost be removed. Accordingly, the above first purification method is very useful as an industrial method for obtaining a highly pure LPF HA. Besides, theLPF HA thus obtained is highly pure and does not contain other proteins, lipids and saccharides as well as endotoxin, and hence, is useful for the preparation of the desired pertussis vaccine. The second method for preparing LPF HA in a high purity is done by using gels such as a cellulose sulfate gel, a polysaccharide gel chemically bound with dextrane sulfate, or a crosslinked polysaccharide sulfate gel cf.Japanese Patent Application Nos. 150,945 1984, 175710 1984 and 190744 1984 which are the same as used for the purification of F HA as described herinbefore. The method comprises the steps of treating a culture of B. pertussis with the gels, thereby adsorbing LPF HA on the gels, followed by eluting LPA HA. The starting culture of B. pertussis used in the second method is the same as that used in the purification method of F HA or that used in the first purification method of LPF HA as described hereinbefore. The purification method of LPF HA using the cellulose sulfate gel and other gels is carried out as follows. The starting LPF HA containing solution may be prepared by centrifuging a culture of B pertussis, diluting the supernatant with distilled water or a buffer so as to become a specific conductivity of 0.1 to 5.0 ms cm, and then subjecting to the adsorption treatment.However, since the supernatant contains usually F HA which has also affinity to the cellulose sulfate gel and other gelds, the supernatant may be subjected to chromatography with cellulose sulfate gel or other gels under the conditions that LPF HA is not adsorbed but F HA is adsorbed wherein the starting solution regulated to z specific conductivity of 5.0 25.0 mS cm and 5 5 9 is passed through G column packed with a cellulose sulfate gel or other gels, which is equilibrated with a buffer of specific conductivity of 5.0 25.0 mS cm and pE 5 9 , and then the fraction passed through the column which does not contain F HA and contains a large amount of LPF HA is subjected to the adsorption treatment. The puri Ication treatment comprising adsorption of LPF HA onto the cellulose sulk ate gel or other gels, washing of the gels adsorbing the LPF HA and elution of the LPF HA can be carried out by a conventional industrially employed operation such as batch method or column method.In case of column method, the cellulose sulfate gel or other gels are packed in a column, and it is previously equlibrated by passing through an appropriate buffer having a specific conductivity of 0.1 to 5.0 mS cm and a pH of 5.0 to 9.0, for example a 0.02 M McIlvaine s buffer pH 5.2 , and then it is used for the adsorption of LPF HA. In the adsorption, the LPF HA containing solution is usually regulated to a pH of 5.0 to 9.0 and a specific conductivity of 0.5 to 5.0 msicmt and then passed through the column packed with the cellulose sulfate gel or other gel to adscrb LPF HA. Thereafter, the column is washed with the same buffer as used for the above equilibration, by which contaminated materials are washed cut. The elution or LPF HA is usually carried out by passing through an appropriate buffer having a pH of 5.0 to 9.0 and a specific conductivity of 5.0 mS cm or more, preferably by stepwise elution or salt concentration gradient elution. That is, when a diluted supernatant obtained by centrifugation cf a culture of B. pertussis is used as the starting material, F ER is also adsorbed together with LPF HA in the above adsorption step, ane hence, it is necessary to elute LPF HA under the condition that can elute LPF HA but not F HA. It is as follows.Firstly, an appropriate buffer having a pH of 5 to 9 and G spcific conductivity of 5 to 100 mS cm, preferably 50 to 60 mS cm for example, a 0.7 M sodium chloride added 0.02 M Mcllvaine s buffer is passed through the column, by which a fraction containing LPF HA is recovered. Thereafter, a buffer having a specific conductivity of larder than that ofi the above buffer for elution e.g. a specific conductivity of 100 to 300 mS cm is passed through, by which F HA and other impur ties are eluted out, followed by equilibrating the cellulose sulfate gel or other gel in order to re use the gel. The most preferable elution is carried out by a salt concentration gradient elution method. In case cf using an LPF HA containing solution, from which F HA is previously removed, the elution is carried out by using a buffer having such a salt concentration gradient as a specific conductivity of 0.5 300 mS cm for example, a 0.02 M McIlvaine s buffer pH 5.2 having a sodium chloride concentration gradient of 0 94.0 M to obtain an LPF HA containing fraction, by which a highly purified LPF HA can be obtained. According to the above purification method, the purification degree of LPF HA becomes several ten folds and further the recovery rate of LPF HA reaches to from more than 80 to almost 100 . Beside, the purified LPF HA has so high specific activity as 0.8 0.9 x 105 LPF Hp ELISA unit mg protein, and further, forms a single band in a polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis analysis pH 4.5 , which means that B. pertussis endotoxin is almost completely removed. Thus, according to the above purification method, the desired LPF HA can be isolated from the starting culture of B. pertussis in a high yield and high purity with very simple operation, and the chromatography adsorbed can be prepared in a low cost and also can be used repeatedly without deterioration, and hence the method is excellent from economical viewpoint. Accordingly, this second purification method is very excellent as an industrial method for production of a highly purified LPF HA. If necessary, the purification may be combined with conventional purification methods, such as sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, ion exchange chromatography, etc. The purified LPF HA thus obtained is very pure and does not contain other proteins, lipids, saccharides, etc., and further, endotoxin is almost completely removed, and hence, it can be used as a starting material for producing the final vaccine. For preparing a vaccine, the purifiedLPF HA is used after being converted into a toxoid by a conventional method using formalin in the presence or absence of an amino acid. The pertussis component vaccine of the present invention can be prepared by simply mixing the highly pureF HA or a toxoid thereof and a toxoid of the highly pureLPF HA ln a ratio of amounts of both components which can give a minimum amount of an antigen necessary for human body. The conversion of LPF HA into a toxoid thereof may be done either before or after it is mixed with F HA. For instance, formalin is added to LPF HA or a mixture thereof with F HA in an amount of 0.1 to 1.0 , and the mixture is allowed to stand at 220 to 400C for 7 to 35 days, and thereafter, formalin is added thereto in an amount of 0.2 , and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature forI to 3 days, optionally with shaking in some occasion, by which the toxicity of LPF HA is lowered.After confirming the lowering of toxicity, the mixture is regulated to a suitable protein content, usually the final protein nitrogen content of 10 to 20 Xg ml. Thereafter, the mixture is optionally mixed with a conventional adjuvant such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, and further a stabilizer such as gelatin or glucose and also a perserv ative such as thimerosal is added thereto and the pH is regulated to the range of 5.4 to 7.4 to give the desired pertussis component vaccine. When LPF HA is alone previously converted into a toxoid, it is mixed with the highly pure F HA or a toxoid thereof. The combined vaccine can be prepared by mixing the pertussis component vaccine with diphtheria toxoid the final concentration 30 Lf ml and tetanus toxoid the final concentration 5 Lf ml . The vaccines thus obtained may be lyophilized to obtain the product. The present invention is Illustrated by the following Preparations and Examples, but should not be construed to be limited thereto.

Preparation 7 Preparation of human ceruloplasmin Cohn s Fraction IV 1 obtained by alcohol fraction of human plasma is used as the starting material. The starting material is subjected to the purification method ofMorell et al. cf. J. Biol. Chem., 244, 3494 1967 to separate human ceruloplasmin. That is, the Cohn s Fraction IV l is subjected to an ion exchange chromatography with DEAE Sepharose CL 6B, and it is subjected to an affinity chromatography with a hemoglobin Sepharose gel in order to remove the possible contamination of haptoglobin. Thereafter, the solution is saltea out with ammonium sulfate and then dialyzed against 0.025 M acetate buffer pH 5.25 to obtain crystalline human ceruloplasmin. Preparation of denatured ceruloplasmin The crystalline ceruloplasmin obtained above is denatured in a similar manner to the procedure described inMorell et al., Science, 127, 588 1963 to prepare the following various denatured ceruloplasmins. 1 Ceruloplasmin denatured with sodium cyanide A 1 w v aqueous solution of crystalline ceruloplasmin 50 ml is dialyzed against a phosphate buffer pit. 7.4, ionic strength 0.2 containing 0.05 M sodium cyanide 5.0 liters at 40C for 12 hours to give a sodium cyanidedenatured ceruloplasmin which looses 90 of oxidase activity. 2 Heat treatment of sodium cyanid denatured ceruloplasmin A 1 w v aqueous solution of sodium cyanidedenatured ceruloplasmin is prepared in the same manner as described in the above 1 . The solution 50 ml is dialyzed against 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 5.0 liters . After the dialysis, the denatured ceruloplasmincontaining solution is heated at 600C for 10 hours. 3 Ceruloplasmin denatured with L ascorbic acid A 1 w v aqueous solution of crystalline ceruloplasmin is dialyzed against an acetate buffer pH 5.2, ionic strength 1.2 5.0 liters containing L ascorbic acid 5 mg ml at 4 C for 36 hours to give an L ascorbic aciddenatured ceruloplasmin which show 65.5 oxidase activity. 4 Ceruloplasmin denatured by heat treatment A 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.5 100 ml containing 5 w v of a crystalline ceruloplasmin is heattreated at 600C for 15 hours. 5 Heat treated ceruloplasmin denatured withL ascorbic acid Cohnls Fraction IV 1 obtained by alcoholic fractionation of human plasma is heated on a bath at bO C for 10 hours. The solution is treated in the same manner as described by Morell et al. cf. Science, 127, 588 1963 to give a heat treated crystalline ceruloplasmin. The heat treated crystalline ceruloplasmin thus obtained is treated in the same manner as described in the above 3 to give a heat treated ceruloplasmin denatured with L ascorbic acid. Preparation of affinity gel The above various denatured ceruloplasmins as 2 ligand are subjected to coupling reaction with CKBr activated Sepharose 4B manufactured by Pharmacia to prepare affinity gels in the following manner. CNBr activated Sepharose 4B 1.5 g is swollen by dipping in 1.0 mM hydrochloric acid 3.0 liters for 15 minutes, and then 1.0 mM hydrochloric acid is removed by suction on a glass filter to give a swollen Sepharose gel 5.25 ml . Separately, a ligand protein amount 150 mg is dissolved in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 8.3, 75 ml containing 0.5 M sodium chloride, and thereto is added the above prepared swollen Sepharose gel 5.25 ml . The mixture is gently stirred at room temperature for 2 hours to complete the coupling reaction. After the coupling reaction, the reaction mixture is washed with the same sodium carbonate buffer as above 150 ml four times, and thereto is added 1.0 M ethanolamine pH 8.0, 150 ml , and the mixture is again reacted with gently stirring for 2 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is washed with the same sodium carbonate buffer 150 ml four times to remove ethanolamine.The resulting gel is washed with 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 8.0 containing 1.0 M sodium chloride 150 ml three times, and further with 0.1 M borate buffer pH 8.0 containing 1.0 M sodium chloride 150 ml three times. The washing with the acetate buffer and the borate buffer are mutually repeated each three times to give various denatured ceruloplasmin Sepharose affinity gels. Purification of LPF HA by column method The affinity gel 20 ml prepared above is packed in a column 28 mmd x 32 mm , and the same starting material 5.0 liters as used in the above Preparation 6 is passed through the column at room temperature at a flow rate of 150 ml cm2 hour. Thereafter, a 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 1,500 ml containing 1.0 M sodium chloride is passed through the column at the same flow rate as above to wash the column. After the washing, an eluent 100 ml consisting of 0.1 M phosphate buffer p 7.5 containing 1.0 M sodium chloride and 3.0 M sodium thiocyanate is passed through the column at a flow rate of 35.0 ml cm2 hour in order to elute LPF HA. There are disclosed in Table 7 the analytical data of the LPF HA fraction and experimental data in the cases of using affinity gels wherein the various denatured ceruloplasmins are used as the ligand. As is clear from the results, in case of using various denatured ceruloplasmins as the ligand, the LPF HA obtained has a high purity and a high specific activity.

The test was carried out by a modification of the method of Munoz, J.J. et al. tct. J. Reticuloendotherial Society, 27, 259 268 1980 . That is, dd F, SPF mice 4 week age, one group 10 mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injection of each vaccine 0.5 ml , and after two weeks, the same vaccine 0.025 ml was subcuraneously innoculated into the footpad of mice inducing injection .After the innoculation, the increased thickness of the footpad of mice was measured at a fixed interval with Dial thickness guage, and the average value in each group of 10 mice was shown as the degree of swelling. The results are shown in the accompanying Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows a graph of plotting of the degree of swelling measured at 1st, 3rd, 7th, 10th and 14th day after the inducing injection of each vaccine. As is clear from the results, the vaccines E toG of the present invention showed significantly lower swelling of the footpad of mice lower side effect in comparison with an old product and the commercially available products B to D which are accellula vaccine. The tested vaccines are as follows A ... Cell vaccine a combined vaccine of pertussis and diphtheria toxoid an old commercial product B ... Precipitated purified pertussis antigen diphtheria toxoid tetanus toxoid combined vaccine a commercially available product C ... The same above D ... The same above E ... The vaccine of Example 1 F ... The vaccine of Example 4 G ... The vaccine of Example ô H ... PBS sodium chloride added phosphate buffer containing 0.2 mg of aluminum pH 6.7 reference Note The commercially available products , C and D are sold by each different companies. Thus, the present invention can provide improved pertussls component vaccine and combined vaccine of pertussis antigen diphtheria toxoid tetanus tooid which have.no side effect such as topical reaction in industrial scale with less expense because the starting F HA and LPF HA can be obtained easily and in high yield and high purity.
