# Stable bleaching compositions.

## Abstract
This invention provides stable peroxyacid bleaching compositions comprising a a surface active peroxyacid and b at least one surfactant which forms a mixed micelle in aqueous solution with said peroxyacid wherein said aqueous solution contains a detergent concentration of about 0.1 to 3.0 grams liter. Buffers and other typical cleaning adjuncts known to those skilled in the art may be included. The invention also provides a method of stabilizing the decomposition rate of surface active peroxyacids.
