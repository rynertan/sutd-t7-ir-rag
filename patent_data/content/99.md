# Thermal energy storage material.

## Abstract
A thermal energy storage material comprising at least one hydrated inorganic salt having a transition temperature to the anhydrous or a less hydrated form in the range 10 to 100 C for example, sodium sulphate decahydrate , the salt being dispersed and suspended in a water insoluble hydrogel formed from a water soluble synthetic polymer having pendant carboxylic or sulphonic acid groups cross linked with cations of a polyvalent metal for example, aluminium or magnesium .
