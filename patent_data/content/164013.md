# Elastomeric shear shaft coupling.

## Abstract
An elastomeric shear shaft coupling is disclosed for connecting two rotatable shafts 12, 14 in end to end rela tionship. The coupling includes hubs 16, 26 for mounting on the opposed ends of the shafts 12, 14 and a flexible ele ment 50 extending between the opposed hubs 16, 26 . Clamping members 52, 54, 44, 46 and suitable fasteners 56 are used to secure the element 50 to the hubs 16, 26 for transmitting the torque developed by the driving shaft 12 to the driven shaft 14 . The flexible element 50 has a bead 80 of harder material than the body of the element 50 , disposed within or at the margins 58 of the element 50 in the locus of clamping, and is reinforced with a matrix of plies 60 or layers of a suitable fabric material.
