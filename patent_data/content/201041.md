## Description
LIQUID SEASONING COMPOSITIONSThis invention refers to Liquid condimental compositions comprising edible flavorings and or edible colorings seasoning, flavoring, or coloring of foods and beverages using liquid spice flavorings and colorings foods and beverages so flavored, seasoned, or colored. The seasoning or flavoring, e.g., spicing, of foods has been accomplished in the following manner a. Ground Spices. This has been the traditional approach, and is still used as the primary method in the home kitchen. In more advanced technological applications, such as commercial food processing, it has been replaced by employment of spice oleoresins, which offer cleanliness and uniformity. b. Oleoresins have traditionally been used in the following forms 1. Directly. Oleoresin paprika, for example, is mixed with salad oil, and added to vinegar to make a separating salad dressing. 2. As dispersions on salt or dextrose. In the case of a French dressing, black pepper oleoresin may be dispersed on salt and added to the vinegar with agitation in the presence of the oil and paprika oleoresin mixture. The black pepper oleoresin will, for the most part, be dissolved into the oil phase if agitation is sufficient. 3. Black pepper oleoresin may alternatively be added to the food in a liquid form, according to i. U.S. Pat Nos. 2,680,690 and 2,626,218 Johnson and Schumm , wherein the oleoresin black pepper is claimed to be dissolved in anhydrous organic acids, such as lactic. This approach suffers from three disadvantages in practice 1 Not all of the pepper essential oil is soluble, and two phase systems result which cannot be evenly incorporated into the food.Flavor variation results. 2 The liquid pepper is not readily dispersible in oil phase systems. ii. U.S. Pat. No. 2,860,054 Yanick utilizes less organic acid than the above, and substitutes therefor ethyl alcohol and an acetate moity. This invention has the advantage over the Johnson Schumm developments in contributing less acidity to the food, but shares their other disadvantages, and in addition may change in composition due to evaporation of alcohol. iii. U.S. Pat. No. 3,464,831 Ziegler discloses a method of making a liquid black pepper extract from a liquid black pepper oleoresin by separating the oleoresin into a liquid oil fraction and a solid fraction by applying a physical force to the oleoresin, such that the said liquid oil fraction contains liquid volatile oil, liquid non volatile oil and dissolved piperine, and the solid fraction consists essentially of at least 60 by weight piperine. The liquid oil fraction constitutes the liquid pepper extract of the invention. iv. U.S. Pat. No. 3,906,116 Quesnel et al , discloses a method for preparing an aqueous emulsion of pepper oleoresin by forming an oleoresin solution or colloidal solution of the pepper oleoresin in a diluent. There is then admixed with the solution under agitation conditions a preformed mixture of an emulsion stabilizer, at least one of an edible or essential oil and then adding thereto an aqueous solution or dispersion of an emulsion stabilizer to form a final mixture. Thereafter the final mixture is emulsified. v. U.S. Pat. No. 4,284,657 Stanton describes an aqueous based fluidized oleoresin composition which contains 10 to 20 percent by weight of a natural oleoresin from about 10 to 20 percent by weight of a surfactant, from about 0.25 to 2 percent by weight of an edible hydrophilic gum, from about 0.025 to 1 percent by weight of phosphoric acid and at least about 60 by weight of water. The disadvantages of this composition include at least the following 1 the high water content limits its oil dispersibility 2 The composition has to be preserved against microbial growth 3 the piperine content crystallizes on storage and requires dissolution, with heat and or agitation, in the finished food product. To be completely utilized by human taste buds, the piperine must be completely dissolved in the ultimate food to which it has been added. vi. U.S. Pat. No. 4,285,981 to Todd et al discloses a homogeneous liquid condimental composition which is dispersible in both oil and water, and consists essentially of lecithin, tartaric esters of monoand diglycerides and, in one embodiment oleoresin black pepper. Disadvantages of this composition include 1 limited dispersibility in water and 2 lack of heat stability upon dispersion in an aqueous system. 4. Oleoresins may be mixed with Polysorbate 80USP in an amount sufficient to dissolve them and to emulsify them in aqueous systems generally the amount is more than 200 by weight of the oleoresin , and added to the aqueous phase of the system. These mixtures cannot be added to the oil phase. In addition,Polysorbate 80, even in trace amounts, will break the emulsions present in naturally emulsified systems such as mayonnaise. The Polysorbate itself has objectionable flavors, may contain a toxic substance known as 1,4 dioxane, and often it accelerates the development of rancid and other off flavors. 5. The oleoresins may be spray dried, using gums, and added to the food after mixing with sugar, starch, or water. Spray dried products have great stability, but are expensive to produce, cannot be made from some oleoresins, and a significant portion of the volatile flavor is lost in the spray drying process. It is apparent from the foregoing that improved, economic, efficient, and more universally utilizable food and beverage flavoring, seasoning, and or coloring systems, which are not characterized by inherent shortcomings and deficiencies of available prior art systems, would be highly desirable and would fulfill a long felt need in the art. Such systems are provided by the present invention. The primary object of this invention is to provide a condlmental system which is dispersible in both oil and water phases of a food or beverage. A second objective of this invention is to provide a single formulation which is compatible with spice oleoresins, essential oils, and natural and synthetic flavorings and colorings used in foods, beverages, or in other applications where humans or animals require non toxic dispersing agents in the substances ingested or exposed to the oral cavity. A third objective of this invention is to overcome the deficiencies in the prior art related to the use of oleoresin black pepper, and at the same time make the water and oil dispersible black pepper flavoring composition compatible with other water and oil dispersible spice flavoring compositions, essential oils, and food colorings.A fourth objective is to provide a condimental system which has no functional effect in the food other than the dispersion of the condiment at the time of incorporation and which, for example, does not affect the usual or natural emulsions or particle aggregation in the food. A fifth objective is to provide a condimental system which is compatible with the various additives found in commercial oleoresins, such as lactic acid, mono and di glycerides, and vegetable oils. A sixth objective is to provide a single system which will distribute flavorings or coloring between the water and oil phases of a food, depending upon the affinity of the flavor or coloring for the oil or water phase. A seventh objective is to provide a single system which will serve to flavor and color juices and beverages, especially those in which pulp or a cloud is present. An eighth objective is to provide a condimental system which has improved heat stability after dispersion in an aqueous system. Additional objectives are To provide a liquid flavoring system which is compatible with ail spice and herb oleoresins and essential oils. To provide a spice flavoring system in which any desirable mixture of flavors can be added to the food or beverage as a single liquid. To provide a liquid flavor which will not precipitate, separate, or stratify on standing and shipping. To provide a flavoring system which will not contribute off flavors to the food because of its ingredients, or because its ingredients are pro oxidants. To provide a flavoring system which can be added to the oil phase, the water phase, or both phases simultaneously in the preparation of the food or beverage. To provide a flavoring system which can be used in conjunction with special applications, such as in conjunction with the coloring of pickles covered with a flavored salt brine or sugar syrup.To provide a flavoring and coloring system which is not dependent upon the pH of the food or beverage. To provide a liquid flavoring system which is more economical than those presently in use. Still other objects will be apparent to one skilled in the art and additional objects will become apparent hereinafter. All of the foregoing and additional objects are achieved by the provision of the flavoring, seasoning, or coloring compositions of the present invention and the foods and beverages flavored, seasoned, or colored therewith.

The present invention relates to a homogenous liquid condimental composition consisting essentially of 1 tartaric and esters of mono and diglyceride 2 an edible fat or oil or mixtures thereof, wherein such edible fat or oil is miscible in 1 and preferably in additix 3 one or more condiments selected from edible flavorings and edible colorings, when one such condiment is oleoresin black pepper, benzyl alcohol is present in a weight ratio of benzyl alcohol to oleoresin black pepper of at least 2 3. The ratio by weight of 1 plus 2 to 3 is at least about 1 9, preferably between about 1 9 to about 99 1, more preferably between about 1 9 to about 9 1, and most preferably between about 3 7 to about 7 3. The ratio by weight of 1 to 2 is preferably between about 1 4 to about 4 1, more preferably between about 2 3 to about 3 2, and most preferably 1 1. When one such condiment is oleoresin black pepper, benzyl alcohol is present in a weight ratio of benzyl alcohol to oleoresin black pepper of at least 2 3, preferably between about 2 3 and about 9 1, more preferably between about 9 11 and about 11 9, and most preferably about 1 1. The condiment portion 3 should comprise at least one condiment from the group consisting of a spice oleoresins, b essential oils, and c edible colorings. It is preferable that ingredients 1 , 2 and 3 be present in a weight ratio of about 1 1 0.5, respectively. The present invention further relates to foods or beverages seasoned, flavored or colored with the condimental composition. Although the weight ratio of 1 and 2 combined to condiment 3 in the composition is at least 1 9, preferably between about 1 9 and about 99 1, more preferably between about 1 9 to about 9 1, and most preferably between about 3 7 to about 7 3, and the weight ratio of 1 to 2 is preferably between about 2 3 to about 3 2, and most preferably about 1 1, the upper and lower limits can vary substantially depending on the results desired by simple experimentation. Similarly, when one of the condiments is oleoresin black pepper, the weight ratio of benzyl alcohol to oleoresin black pepper is at least 2 3, preferably between about 2 3 and about 3 2, more preferably between about 9 11 and about 11 9, and most preferably about 1 1, the upper and lower limits can vary substantially depending on the results desired by simple experimentation.By varying the ratios, one can alter the dispersibility of the seasoning composition, the cost of the product and the physical properties of the seasoning composition, i.e. liquid versus solid. Notwithstanding the above variations, the various ratios depend upon the compatibility of the particular dispersing system and the condiment portion. Although it is the primary intent of this invention to provide a liquid condimental composition useful in flavoring or coloring foods and beverages and which is dispersible in both oil and water, it is readily apparent that such a condimental composition may, under certain conditions and weight ratios of components, be a solid. Such a solid condimental composition is intended to be within the scope of the invention, if it is useful in flavoring or coloring foods and beverages and is dispersible in both oil and water. The following examples are given by way of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting.As used in these examples, the term oleoresin black pepper denotes a mixture of oleoresin black pepper and benzyl alcohol in a 50 50 weight ratio.

The scallions were then added and the resultant oriental oil vinegar salad dressing was refrigerated.The w o flavors imparted flavor to both the oil and aqueous phases of the salad dressing.Such a distribution of w o flavor between the oil and water phases is one of the purposes of this invention.The utility of this aspect of the invention is considerable, as will be apparent to a food technologist. 4. Minestrone Soup The minestrone soup was prepared according to the following recipe Ingredients Wt. Water 51.650Potatoes, diced 9.900Zucchini, cut 8.970Kidney beans cooked 8.330Cabbage, shredded 5.000Lima beans, green, cooked 4.210 Macaroni, elbow, dried 3.670Carrot, diced 3.530Tomato Paste 2.450Salt Pork 1.900Salt 0.250Parsley, minced 0.100Black Pepper w o Flavor 0.010Celery w o Flavor 0.005Origanum w o Flavor 0.004Basil w o Flavor 0.006Garlic w o Flavor 0.005Onion w o Flavor 0.010 100.000 The salt pork, parsley and water were combined and heated for about 10 minutes. The tomato paste was added and the mixture was cooked for 15 minutes.The cabbage was then added and the mixture was cooked for another 10 minutes. The beans were added and the mixture was brought to a boil. Upon reaching boil, the macaroni and salt were added and the mixture was cooked until the macaroni was tender. The w o flavors were then added and the resultant minestrone soup was hot packed into jars and retorted at 2500 for 15 minutes. 5. Creamy Italian Dressing The creamy italian dressing was prepared according to the following recipe Ingredients Wt. Corn oil 47.975Water 37.480Vinegar, 100 grain 6.000Sour cream powder 4.000Sugar, superfine 1.000Salt 1.000Cultured non fat milk solids 1.000Egg yolk solids 0.500Polysorbate 60 0.400Xanthum gum 0.250Parsley flakes 0.200Propylene glycol alginate 0.100Basil w o Flavor 0.030Black Pepper w o Flavor 0.030Origanum w o Flavor 0.020Garlic w o Flavor 0.010Onion w o Flavor 0.005 100.000 The water, vinegar and w o flavors were combined and mixed. The gums were dispersed in the corn oil and added to the aqueous mixture under agitation.The dry ingredients were then added and the entire mixture was homogenized for about 5 minutes. The parsley flakes were then mixed in and the resultant creamy Italian dressing was refrigerated. 6. Beverages and Juices As pointed out in the prior description of the invention, the w o flavors are not water soluble, but rather are only water dispersible. Upon standing in water alone, they will tend to separate. This is particularly true if the w o flavor contains oleoresins which contain large amounts of vegetable oils. However, this invention provides such b fine dispersion of the oleoresins that they may be used to flavor and color beverages, including juices, containing sufficient suspended matter cloud or fibers to absorb the dispersed w o flavor .A spiced tomato juice drink was prepared according to the following recipe Ingredients Wt. Tomato Juice, no additives 98.955Salt, granulated 1.000Debittered celery w o flavor 0.040Black pepper w o flavor 0.005 100.000 All ingredients were combined and mixed well.The resultant spiced tomato juice drink can be pasteurized 1950F for 30 seconds and packed into a suitable container. Neither the debittered celery nor black pepper w o flavor were observed to separate from the juice. It is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the exact details of operation or exact compounds, compositions, methods, or procedures shown and described, as obvious modifications and equivalents will be apparent to one skilled in the art.
