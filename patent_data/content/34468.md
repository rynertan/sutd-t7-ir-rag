## Description
Improvements in and relating to the joining of tubes This invention relates to the joining together by brazing or soldering of metal tubing. Lengths of metal tubing are frequently joined together by soldering or brazing in which joining means, commonly known in the art as fittings, unions or couplings herein simply referred to as couplings are utilised. Such couplings usually comprise two or more sockets with each socket formed to receive, with marginal clearance, an end portion of a length of tubing and carrying in an annular groove or recess around its inner surface a brazing alloy or a soldering alloy. In use, an end portion of tubing is inserted into a socket and upon heating of the coupling and the said end portion, molten brazing alloy or soldering alloy flows by capillary action between the inner surface of the socket and the outer surface of the tubing the jointing surfaces to produce, on cooling a strong and durable joint. In one simple embodiment, a coupling may be used for joining two sections of tubing in a substantially straight line, both sections of tubing having the same nominal external diameter.More complex couplings may involve the use of bends or elbows and or reducing bores and or means for joining more than two sections of tubing, for example, take the form of tee, cross or Y pieces. We have now found that the brazing alloy or soldering alloy may be replaced with thermoplastic brazing or soldering material. According to one aspect of the present invention, therefore, a coupling as hereinbefore defined comprises at least two sockets, each socket having one or more indentations, for example grooves or recesses formed in its inner surface with each indentation groove or recess carrying a deposit comprising a thermoplastic brazing or soldering material. The internal diameter of each socket should generally be such that it fits over a section of tubing with a tolerance so that the brazing or soldering composition will, when molten, flow by capillary action between the jointing surfaces .Naturally, the brazing or soldering composition should not project from the groove or recess into the socket to an extent greater than that which will permit the entry of a section of tubing of the appropriate size. Each groove or recess may take the form of a peripherally continuous or discontinuous annulus, that is to say, an endless or broken groove or recess, or it may take another form, for example that of a continuous or discontinuous helix or a spiral or a series or pattern of recesses may be used. Furthermore, we have found that the internal cross sectional profile of the groove or recess may have a significant effect on the ease of carrying out the jointing operation and on the quality of the joint when formed. Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary or desirable to have a groove which is relatively broad d shallow whereas a relatively deeper and or narrower groove or, for example, a groove having an arcuate inner cross sectional profile may be preferred.Each indentation may have a part circular cross sectional shape selected from the group consisting of a semi circular segment of a circle having a chord coterminus with the inner surface of the socket andhaving a length less than the diameter of the said circle. Other modifications to the internal cross sectional profile are within the scope of the invention. One factor which may limit the choice of profile is the desired thickness of the socket walls.Where the socket walls are insufficiently thick to accept a groove or recess formed therein by removal of metal, the groove or recess may be rolled or otherwise formed in the socket wall.In such a case the existence of a groove or recess will be reflected in the external shape of the socket wall. Thermoplastic brazing compositions suitable for use with couplings according to the present invention are described in our co pending British patent application No. 36655 78 filed on 13th September 1978 claiming priority from British PatentApplication No. 38738 77 filed on 16th September 1977, and comprise aJPixture of particulate brazing alloy and a thermoplastic material, optionally with the addition of flux. Thermoplastic soldering compositions suitable for use with couplings according to the present invention are described in our copending British patent Application No. 8010889 filed on 1stApril 1980 and comprising a particulate soldering metal or alloy or oxide s reducible to said metal or alloy, a flux which may have thermoplastic properties and, if necessary, a thermoplastic binder. In more detail, couplings according to the present invention consist essentially of one or more short, hollow, open ended cylinders forming a ring, tee, Y , or cross, for example, defining two or more sockets adapted to receive with marginal clearance the end portions of sections of tubing which it is desired to join together, the extent to which a section of tubing can be inserted into a socket being limited by an internal annular shoulder, each socket having in its inner surface and between its open end and said shoulder one or more essentially annular grooves or recesses, each of said grooves or recesses carrying a deposit comprising a thermoplastic brazing material or thermoplastic soldering material. Couplings according to the present invention may very simply be made by assembling and or machining a blank that is, devoid of brazing or soldering material coupling and then inserting into each groove or recess thermoplastic brazing material or thermoplastic soldering material by extrusion moulding for example. Brazing or soldering operations may be carried out in a similar fashion to that using prior art couplings, that is to say, by inserting the ends of sections of tubing into the coupling, suitable cleaning and other preliminary operations having first been carried out and applying heat, for example from a blowlamp, to melt and burn away the thermoplastic material, melt flux if used, and melt the brazing or soldering alloy which then flows by capillary action between the jointing surfaces to form, on cooling a strong and durable joint. The need for any separate fluxing operation is thus avoided. We have found that the thermoplastic material is very satisfactorily chased out from the grooves or recess and away from the jointing surfaces on application of heat and does not in any way interfere with the successful formation of a joint. The temperature to which it is necessary to heat the 0 coupling is generally in the range 200 300 C for soldering and greater than about 4500C for brazing operations. One form of straight coupling in accordance with the invention is shown by way of example in the accompanying drawing. The drawing shows a straight coupling partially sectioned having a copper tube 1 formed with two semi circular cross sectioned annular grooves 2. Each groove is filed with a thermoplastic brazing or soldering material 3. The copper tube 1 is divided longitudinally into two sockets by an internally extending flange 4 which limits the distance a length of tube can be inserted into the tube.
