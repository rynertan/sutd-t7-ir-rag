# Method and apparatus for treatment in counter current of suspended particles with a liquid.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for treating in counter current of suspended particles with a liquid, whereby the particles and the liquid are transferred in opposite directions through a contact zone 1 which, at some places, spaced in axial di rection, is stirred 4, 5 in planes perpendicular to the centre line of the contact zone, in which the contact zone is one continuous space and that the volume fraction of the solid matter in the contact zone is maintained at a value between 0.20 and 0.55.
