# TUNGSTEN HALOGEN LAMP INCLUDING DIFFUSING MEANS AS PART THEREOF

## Abstract
A low wattage tungsten halogen lamp having a base, a tungsten halogen capsule secured to the base, the capsule including a first envelope and a filament structure axially located within the first envelope. A second envelope is located substantially about the first envelope and is secured to the base of the lamp. The lamp further includes light diffusing means located within the lamp for diffusing the light emitted by the filament structure. The light diffusing means includes diffusing surfaces formed within the first and second envelopes. The preferable method of forming the diffusing surfaces is by chemical etching.
