## Description
Mouth piece for a grit blasting device with suction remove. The inveniton relates to a mouth piece for a device like a grit blasting device with suction remove, which mouth piece consists of a member preferably annular or cylindrical, that has been fastened, or by means of clamps has been connected, to the inlet of a suction channel of a grit blasting device and in this annular part around the central orifice a wreath of hair or one of more brushes has been placed. Generally known is the technique of sand blasting articles Under great force sand is spouted or blasted against an object, which causes undesired particles to be removed from the surface. Sand blasting technique has been develloped further. At this moment most of the devices used, utilize a suction device, to directly suck away the material which has been used to blast with. This removal is of great importance becausewhen sand of other materials, with which can be blasted efficiently, are regularely inhaled, it will in time cause damage to a persons health. At present a generally known technique is, that by means of the suction mouth of the grit blasting device the stream of grit material is directed onto the surface of the object and removed from the object through the same mouth such a device is known as a grit blasting device with suctionremove or a suction grit blasting device . It has the advantage, that when the suction mouth has a wreath of hair or brushes or has been closed by other means, all the material which has been blasted onto the object together with the surface particles, which have been loosened from it, will be sucked away before they can come into the surrounding air and therefore cannot become detrimental to the health. An extra advantage is, that the grit can be recaptured, cleaned and re used, which is of an economical interest, because the present used grit has a greater effectiveness but is more expensive than the sand, which had been generally used and which is always available. Suction grit blasting devices are very usefull to gritblast flat surfaces However when edges or rough surfaces have to be grit blasted, then the brushes around the suction mouth will not remain completely closed. The aim of the invention is a mouth piece with which it is possible to grit blast edges and surfaces on which there are ribbons, by means of a suction grit blasting device while the grit cannot escape through the crefice between the hairs or brushes. This aim of the invention has been attained by inserting a deformable piece, for example a cylindrical case, inside the wreath of hair around the inlet orifice. With this piece, it is possible to grit blast edges, because when the brushes no longer form an air tight surrounding of the inlet, the deformable piece will serve as a tight sleeve. By preference the deformable piece is a bellows with one or more annular grooves or constrictions. The outlet of the bellows is pliable and for this reason will be better adaptable to edges. Therefore, the deformable piece is preferably made of an elastic material, such as rubber, leather of plastic, and should be slightly conical to obtain the best flow of the sucked off grit material. By means of the drawings the invention will be explained.In the drawings are Fig. 1 a cross section of the mouth piece on the outlet of a sucktion gritblasting device Fig. 2 a side view of the mouth piece as shown in figure 1, placed on the edge of an object to be grit blasted. Figure 1, the cross section, shows a mouth piece 1 clamped onto the suction inlet orifice 2 of the suction channel 3 of a grit blasting device. The suction channel 3 encompasses an elbow piece 4 to which is connected a flexible hose not shown in the drawings . In the elbow piece 4 a nozzle 5 is fixed through which the grit material can be blown under high pressure. The mouth piece consists of an annular member 6, which is double walled and in which, between the outer wall 7 and the inner wall 8, two annular brushes 9 and 10 can be clamped.The annular component 6 is made out of plastic, which makes the walls slightly deformable, so that the brushes can be better fastened into it, The brushes 9 and 10 consist of hairs, which are fastened into an annular metalic clamp 12. The inner wall 8 of the annular component 6 has a rim 13 which points towards the inside and against which one end of a deformable member or bellows 14 can be fastened by means of a clamping ring 15. The deformable component or bellows 14 has two constrictions 16 and 17. In figure 2 is shown, how the bellows takes over the function of the wreath of hair when an edge 18 of an object 19 has to be grit blasted. The hair 11 of the brushes will be separated at two places due to the edge 18 of the object 19.This causes a crevice 20, which will be so large that the grit can easily escape. By pressing the mouth piece firmly against the edge 18, the deformable component of bellows 14 will try to envellope the edge 18. Through the very small remaining opening 21 hardly any grit will escape because the suction force of the suction gritblasting device is normally large enough to minimize the loss.
