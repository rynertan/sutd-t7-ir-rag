# Methane conversion.

## Abstract
Methane is converted to higher hydrocarbons, particu larly ethylene and ethane, and most desirably ethylene, by contacting a feed comprising methane, such as natural gas, and a free oxygen containing gas, such as oxygen or air, with a solid contact material, comprising a a component comprising at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Group IA and Group IIA metals b a component comprising at least one material se lected from the group consisting of phosphate radicals and compounds containing phosphate radicals and c , optionally, at least one material selected from the group consisting of halogen ions and compounds containing halogen ions, under oxidative conversion conditions sufficient to con vert the methane to the higher hydrocarbons.
