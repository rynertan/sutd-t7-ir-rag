## Description
Description Erasable Ink Composition And Process For Forming Erasable ScriptTechnical Field This invention relates to an ink composition that is erasable. The composition can include colorant, thermoplastic elastomer, plasticizer, solvent, lubricant, resin as well as other conventional ingredients known to those skilled in the art. Script formed with this ink can be erased using a conventional pencil eraser. The invention also relates to a process of forming erasable script.Background Art Erasable writing compositions are well known in the art. They can be dispensed through ball point writing instruments as well as other writing devices. The compositions are designed to facilitate removal of script before affixed to a substrate, like paper. For a writing medium to be erasable, the writing composition must temporarily prevent penetration of the substrate by colorant. If penetration i not inhibited, the substrate can be damaged before the writing composition is erased.This erasable feature has necessitated undesirable rheological properties for prior art compositions. Rheological properties of commercial erasable ink compositions inhibit delivery of a uniform layer of ink to substrates. Simply, commercially available erasable ink compositions used in ball point pens have the disadvantage of not producing a uniform script. Those compositions are hard to start. Ink intensity varies with writing speed script is not sharp. Typically, this script is characterized by filaments of ink which detract from line sharpness. Such defects apparently result from undesirable rheological properties of the commercially available ink compositions. The rheology widely deviates from Newtonian behavior. Known commercial erasable ink compositions have undesirable rheological properties. U.S. patent No.4,097,290 to Muller et al. relates to an erasable ink composition which contains natural rubber or rubber which essentially duplicates the chemical structure of natural rubber. It also contains a volatile low boiling point organic solvent as well as a high boiling point organic solvent. The composition operates by rapid evaporation of the low boiling solvent when the composition is applied to substrates. The viscosity of the mixture increases and penetration of the remaining natural rubber and colorant is minimized because the remaining residue thickens.Then, the high boiling solvent evaporates and the pigment rubber adheres to and penetrates into the substrate. Then, the ink is no longer erasable. Another known commercialized erasable ink composition also possesses the aforementioned disadvantages. U.S. patent No. 3,875,105 to Daugherty et al. teaches an erasable ink composition containing a low boiling solvent, a polyvinyl methyl ether and a colorant. Specific concentrations are taught for these components. When the composition is applied to a substrate, such as paper, the solvent quickly evaporates to effect an increase in viscosity. The polyvinyl methyl ether is only soluble in the solvent. When the solvent evaporates, the ether precipitates to capture colorant. Consequently the colorant remains on the paper and does not penetrate it. Both of these commercial compositions effect radical changes in rheological properties with respect to conventional inks. These commercial compositions rely upon this effect to acheive temporary erasability of the ink composition. The present invention seeks to overcome the disadvantages of such compositions. Prior art compositions rely on radical changes in the rheological properties of the compositions which necessitate wide deviation from Newtonian behavior. Rather, the present invention is directed to an erasable ink composition which can approach Newtonian behavior, that is, water like behavior. Simply, the composition of the present invention can flow on application of a small force and for which its rate of flow is approximately directly proportional to the applied force.Summary of the Invention This discovery relates to an erasable ink composition that can be erased using a pencil eraser. The erasable ink can be used in conventional ball point pens. The composition contains colorant, a novel combination of a thermoplastic elastomer and plasticizer components and solvent. The combination of the thermoplastic elastomer and plasticizer is important to the composition. Other ingredients can include resins, lubricants and dispersants. The colorant and solvent are conventional the interaction of all the components is not conventional. The invention also relates to a process for forming erasable script.Nomenclature A lexicon has been used herein to identify and refer to the various types of components used in the erasable ink composition of the present invention. These components are colorant, thermoplastic elastomer, plasticizer, solvent, resin and lubricant, which are defined as follows Colorant means a solid insoluble coloring material such as a pigment, dispersions thereof or means a dyestuff. If possible, these materials are identified by a color index number.Thermoplastic elastomer means those materials which have rubber like characteristics at ambient temperature e.g., 10 F to 1200 F but can be melted and processed at elevated temperatures e.g., 2500 F to 5000 F . The elastomers are soluble in innocuous solvents ana bond colorant. The elastomers include block copolymers as well as thermoplastic elastomers having like properties but not homopolymers or random copolymers.Plasticizer means a high boiling point solvent or softening agent, usually liquid, lauded to the elastomer to facilitate processing or to increase flexibility or toughness. The plasticizer is incompatible with the elastomer.Solvent means a substance capable of dissolving the thermoplastic elastomer. Resin means a solid to liquid low molecular weight modifier for the elastomer.Lubricant means an ink additive that increases slip or decreases friction during use of the erasable ink composition.Other terms are conventional.Disclosure of the Invention The present invention relates to an erasable ink composition comprising a thermoplastic elastomer block copolymer in which the end groups are composed of non elastomeric blocks which act as physical cross links in the absence of specific solvents and when the material is below the Tgt glass transition temperature, of the non elastomer block, a plasticizer which is incompatible or of limited compatibility with the thermoplasticelastomer copolymer in the absence of a solvent, a solvent which acts as a solvent for the copolymer and is at least compatible with the plasticizer to produce a uniformly dispersed composition that flows on application of a small force, and a colorant, said composition when applied to Åa porous substrate as an ink causes evaporation of said solvent without significant penetration of the composition into the porous substrate to produce a colored script comprising the copolymer and the incompatible plasticizer which is erasable without smearing and in which the plasticizer gradually bleeds out of the copolymer due to its incompatibility and the copolymer physically cross links in time to form a non erasable permanent colored script. The invention also relates to a process of forming an erasable ink script which, within time, becomes permanent and non erasable which comprises applying to a porous substrate by suitable means a composition comprising a thermoplastic elastomer block copolymer in which the end groups comprise non elastomeric thermoplastic blocks containing physically cross linkable groups, a plasticizer which is incompatible with or of limited compatibility with the thermoplastic elastomer copolymer in the absence of a solvent, a colorant, a solvent which acts as a solvent for the thermoplasticelastomer copolymer and is at least compatible with the plasticizer to produce a uniformly disbursed composition that flows on application of a small force, evaporating the solvent from the composition after it has been applied to the porous substrate without significant penetration of the composition into the porous substrate to produce a colored script comprising the copolymer and the incompatible plasticizer which is erasable without smearing, permitting the incompatible plasticizer to gradually bleed out of the copolymer into the porous substrate and permitting the copolymer to gradually physically cross link to form a non erasable colored script. Concentration ranges for the colorant is from about 0.1 to about 60 , for the thermoplastic elastomer is from about 8 to about 30 for the plasticizer is from about 10 to about 35 and for the solvent is from about 10 to about 40 , all percent by weight of the composition. Henceforth, concentrations are percent or parts by weight of the composition. The combination can further comprise resin in an amount up to about 12 , lubricant in an amount up to about 8 and dispersant in an amount up to about 2 . Concentrations for other components are well known to those skilled in the art. It has not been possible to discern the causes or physical changes that occur when the ink is written on paper that effect erasability. The mechanism by which the erasable ink composition of this invention effects temporary erasability is just not known. This mechanism is not crucial to the advantageous practice of this invention. The following discussion merely postulates what is believed to be a mechanism that could describe the interaction of components to effect temporary erasability. For ink to be erased from a substrate, the ink must not wet or penetrate it. Paper, a common substrate, is a pervious mat of fibers. The surface of the paper has pores or capillary interstices of randomly oriented paper fibers. As long as the colorant in the ink does not enter the pores, the ink can be erased. Once colorant penetrates the pores of the paper, the colorant anchors within the paper and it can only be removed by abrasion of that porous surface. Even after damaging the paper in this manner, a residual stain from the anchored colorant can remain. To avoid damaging the substrate when removing ink and to prevent residual stain, penetration of colorant into paper pores is controlled. Control is believed to be affected by regulating the solubility parameter for the plasticizer in the initially homogeneous composition of thermoplastic elastomer, plasticizer and solvent. The elastomer and plasticizer are of limited compatibility.Solubility of the elastomer is affected by the type of plasticizer, weight ratio of plasticizer to elastomer and, most particularly, by.the selection of a solvent having an appropriate solubility parameter. Before evaporation of solvent, it functions to make the mixture homogeneous and to prevent elastomer from crosslinking. When the composition is placed on the substrate, the solvent evaporates. Rate of evaporation determines the period during which the ink composition is erasable. Once the solvent has evaporated, the remainder of the composition becomes incompatible. Then, the plasticizer is squeezed out of the incompatible mixture.The plasticizer, which is incompatible with the elastomer, begins to bleed into the pores of the paper. Although colorant is bonded to the elastomer, some bleeds or secretes with the plasticizer. This impregnation stains the paper. Bleeding is complete after from about 24 to 72 hours and the ink is no longer erasable without damaging the paper. This period varies with the choice of plasticizer and its concentration relative to the elastomer. While the bleeding is occurring, a certain amount of cold flow is believed to take place and the bulk ink film creeps or sags into the paper crevices where it is inaccessible to erasure. Thereafter, the ink is anchored to the paper and is permanent script. The colorant is a conventional component of the composition that functions to provide color to the ink.Typically the colorant is pigment, which contains insoluble particles. An advantageous concentration range is between about 20 to about 30 for pigments. Particle size for the pigment should be less than 5 microns.Pigment dispersions can also be used in a concentration range between about 1 and about 50 . Pigment can be dispersed in the thermoplastic elastomer or in any of the necessary plasticizers or resins. Dyestuffs can be used in a concentration range between about 0.18 and about 68. Typical colorants that can be used in this novel composition include Phthalocyanine Blue PB 15 , 50 Pigment Blue 15 in Rosin, Pure Blue Oleate Solvent Blue 5 , 70 Victoria Blue Pigment Blue 1 in StyreneEthylene Butylene Styrene, 60 Victoria Blue in StyreneEthylene Butylene Styrene, 40 Victoria Blue in DioctylAdipate, 50 Permanent Red 2B Pigment Red 48 in StyreneEthylene Butylene Styrene, 40 Carbon Black Pigment Black 6 in Dioctyl Adipate, Quinacridone Red PR 122 , WatchungRed B PB 48 1 , Watchung Red Y PB 48 2 RadiantRed Orange, Perylene Red PR 177 , Carbon Blacks,Permanent Yellow PY 14, 15 or 16 , Carbazole Violet PV 23 , Victoria Blue PV 1 , Rhodamine PMA PV 1 , Violet 36, Oleate of Solvent Blue 4, Victoria Pure Blue BO Oleate or Methyl Violet Oleate.Other conventional colorants known to those skilled in this art can also be used in formulating the erasable ink. The combination of two other components is critical and important. Their use produces an unexpected result. These components are the thermoplastic elastomer and the plasticizer. The thermoplastic elastomer is a block copolymer and differs fundamentally in molecular structure from the typical plastic or commercial rubber homopolymers or random copolymers . The block copolymer has chains of at least three blocks, an elastomeric block in the center and a thermoplastic block on each end. The homopolymers or copolymers do not have such a molecular structure. These synthetic ink components determine characteristics of flow, stability and erasability, which relate to performance of the erasable ink composition. Writing performance of a ball point pen is dependent on a consistent delivery of a uniform layer of ink to the ball surface at all writing speeds. In the simplest case Q ink film thickness F ink drive force K geometry of point viscosity For a non pressurized, non erasable ball point pen, F is equal to the force of gravity. Viscosity is a measure of resistance to flow and is about 50 150 poise for non erasable ink. It is constant at all normal writing speeds. For the normal, non erasable ball point pen ink, such a viscosity range closely resembles behavior ofNewtonian fluids. As a result, such pens deliver a uniform layer of ink at usual writing speeds and produce a uniform script. Defects of the commercially available erasable inks are believed to be due to the necessarily undesirable rheology of commercial erasable inks. They have much higher viscosity than non erasable inks and show wide deviations from Newtonian behavior, and, furthermore, viscosity is not a donstant factor throughout the normal range of writing speeds. As a consequence of this difficult behavior, commercial erasable ball point pens are pressurized. This facilitates delivery of the composition to the tip of the pen. Pressure is required because the force of gravity is inadequate to overcome the ink s resistance to flow. Inks having viscosity in the range of 540 to 4000 poises require pressure up to 200 psig. Under these conditions, the commericial inks filament and splatter to produce non sharp script at normal writing speeds. However, the present invention results in an erasable ink composition that unexpectedly a does not have the rheological deficiencies noted for commercial erasable ball point pen ink, and b the composition can function in pens with or without pressurization.When pressure is applied to the composition, the greatest pressure required is 100 psig. This novel composition can function at lower viscosities and without thixotropy decreasing viscosity with increasing writing speed compared to commercial erasable inks. Thermoplastic elastomers have been found to uniquely and advantageously adapt to conflicting demands of erasable inks. The erasable ink of the present invention can more nearly approximate Newtonian flow characteristics of normal, non erdsable ball point pen ink. This is achieved by judicious selection of thermoplastic elastomer solvents and plasticizer. The function of the elastomer is to bind colorant when the ink dries. The plasticizer functions in conjunction with the solvent to control rheology thereby facilitating delivery of erasable ink from a pen. When wet with solvent, the plasticizer may also function as a co solvent for the elastomer. When dry or in the absence of solvent, the plasticizer functions to carry enough colorant to the substrate to make permanent script. According to the present invention, the thermoplastic elastomer is a block copolymer of styrene butadiene styrene, styrene isoprene styrene or styrene ethylene butylene styrene block copolymers. Other thermoplastic elastomers of like properties are known to those skilled in the art and can also be used. The latter block copolymer has an ethylene butylene midblock, that is, a polyolefin midblock. It is a styrene diene styrene copolymer in which the chemical structure of the diene component has been modified by partial hydrogenation. It is obtained by selectively hydrogenating polystyrene polybutadiene polystyrene where the polybutadiene has a relatively high 1,2 cis configuration. The polyolefin midblock copolymer is more important than other block copolymers. It has surprisingly excellent resistance to degradation by oxygen, ozone, ultraviolet light, temperature and moisture. These block copolymers, having selectively hydrogenated conjugated diene blocks, are described inU.S. patent No. 3,595,942 and in U.S. reissue patent No.27,145. Those patent disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference. The advantageous concentration range for these block copolymers is from about 10 to about 20 . The effect of plasticizers on rheology and properties of the thermoplastic elastomer based erasable ball point pen ink was unexpected. The plasticizers of the present invention were neither known to be plasticizers for the thermo plastic rubber nor knows to be solvents for it. It has also been discovered that plasticizers are important and inhibit gellation of high solids content thermoplastic elastomer solutions, which are suitable for erasable ink formulations. For example, known plasticizers for thermoplastic elastomers aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon oils will cause such solutions to gel to a solid while equivalent or lesser amounts of plasticizers of this invention will allow indefinite liquidity of such solutions with essentially no change in viscosity during storage.Aliphatic esters are advantageous for this purpose, such as butyl stearate or dioctyl adipate, although aromatic esters, such as. dioctyl phthalate are useful. Viscosity varies with admixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. The solvent effect of a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents and ester plasticizers on thermoplastic estomers produces a fluid have a stable viscosity ranging from about 48 poise to about 500 poise that is suitable for an erasable ball point pen ink when suitably colored. Any of the inks in this viscosity range can be dispensed from a pressurized or non pressurized ball point pen. Suitable pressure should be employed, that is, lower pressure for lower viscosity inks and higher pressures for higher viscosity inks. The greatest pressure required is about 100 psig. The lower viscosity inks of the present invention can be dispensed from a non pressurized ball point pen cartridge in a manner similar to normal ball point ink. Best initial erasure can be obtained by maintaining the thermoplastic elastomer to plasticizer weight ratio between about 0.1 and about 1.5. Good delayed erasure resistance, however, is obtained above the thermoplastic elastomer to plasticizer weight ratio of about 1.5. The script becomes non erasable to smear prone above a weight ratio of about 3. Thus, a variety of erasure properties can be obtained on a single type of paper by varying the ratio of thermoplastic elastomer to plasticizer or the ink can be tailored for acceptable erasure properties on a wide variety of papers by the same mechanism. Different plasticizers, or mixtures of plasticizers, also affect erasure properties. Dioctyl adipate or a mixture of it with a polyterpene resin is advantageous. It has the widest range of erasure properties on commercially available writing papers. The plasticizer is advantageously an ester whic can be aliphatic or aromatic, for example, dioctyl phthalate, dioctyl adipate, decylbutyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, octyldecyl phthalate, butylbenzyl phthalate, dioctyl azaleate, dioctyl sebacate, butyl stearate, tricresyl phosphate, straight chain phthalate esters or polymeric ester plasticizer. The plasticizer improves erasability and improves lubricity for a ball point pen.The advantageous concentration range is from about 15 to about 26 . Some hydrocarbon plasticizers are also useful paraffinic oil, aromatic or naphthenic oil. Though the unexpected results of plasticizers and solvents on the properties of thermoplastic elastomers, various useful erasable ball point ink formulations can be easily made with selected colorants to provide a variety of appealing, erasable colored script in accordance with the teachings of this application by those skilled in the art. Solvent is included in the composition. It functions to dissolve the elastomer along with the plasticizer. The solvent can be aromatic or aliphatic or mixtures thereof. The erasable formulations result from solutions of the thermoplastic elastomer whose multicomponent Hildebrand solubility parameter ranges from about 7 to about 10 cal. cm3 1 2 Some of these solvents or mixtures, thereof, preferentially dissolve the olefin phase of the block copolymer, others favor the styrene blocks. The nature of the solution helps to retard the penetration of ink into paper fibers, permitting erasure. Exemplary solvents are alcohols, ethers, esters, hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, lactol spirits, heptane, methyl cyclohexane, isoparaffinic solvents, toluene, high boiling aromatic solvents, xylene, ethyl benzene, ketones, butyl acetate or methyl cellosolve.The advantageous concentration range is between about 10 and about 30 . Other components are useful but optional in the composition of the present invention. They include resins, lubricants and dispersants. The resin is preferably a solid plasticizer for the elastomer. It functions to delay erasability and control change in the physical characteristics of wet ink. Other conventional additives including driers, waxes, antioxidants, surface energy reducing agents, thickeners, gellants, defoamers, wetting agents, inhibitors, stabilizing agents, and shorteners known to persons of ordinary skill in the art can also be included. Those other ingredients should not affect the novel rheological properties of this inventive erasable ink composition. According to the invention, suitable resins are cyclized rubber, glycerol esters of abietic acid, polyterpene resins, methyl styrene vinyl toluene copolymers, aromatic hydrocarbon resins, polystyrene resins, coumarone indene resins or polyterpene.oligomers. The thermoplastic polyterpene resin is advantageous. The resin tends to alter both the gel like system of the present invention and its adhesion, thereby promoting greater penetration into the substrate. This penetration effects increasing erasure resistance as the time for paper contact progresses. The advantageous concentration range is up to about 10 . The inventive composition can also include a dispersant such as alkylated polyvinyl pyrolidone. The concentration is up to about 2 .

It can consist of two operations vehicle preparation and color dispersion.Vehicle preparation is conventional and can comprise merely dissolving the vehicle in a solvent.Color dispersion is usually done in conventional ball mills. Other operations known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be included in this manufacture. The erasable ink of the present invention is most suitable for ball point pens. The ink can flow under gravitational forces or under pressure. Means can be provided for applying to the ink a pressure exceeding atmospheric pressure. This can include confining compressed or liquified gas, such as air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and freon above the erasable ink in an ink cartridge. This can also include enclosing a substance which makes a gas when warmed. Mechanical means can also generate the pressure. Pressure can be atmospheric, mechanical, chemical or from a gas. Examples The following examples illustrate the novel erasable ink formulation. As pointed out above, it has not been possible to discern what causes erasability nor the mechanism of the components that effects it. However, the effect of different blends of colorant, elastomer, plasticizer and solvent on erasability can be demonstrated. These examples are merely illustrative of the formulations and are not considered to limit the present invention.
