# DEVICE FOR FORMING PATTERNS FROM AEROSOL CONTAINER

## Abstract
A marking device for mounting on the valve stem of a pressurized dispenser having a valve actuated by said valve stem, said container having a marking material and a propellant medium therein, said marking device comprising a mark forming member, provided with an axial bore, said mark forming member being adapted to be connected with the valve stem so that there is provided communication between the axial bore and a dispensing passage in the valve stem when the valve stem is actuated so as to dispense the marking material from the mark forming member, said mark forming member having a surface for contacting an object to be marked, said surface having disposed therein one or a plurality of open grooves extending radially from the axial bore to the outer periphery of the surface, characterized by the fact that said grooves 19 19 have facing side walls 21, 22 21 , 22 angularly disposed with respect to each other so as to diverge in the direction of the surface 20 20 in which the grooves 19, 19 are disposed.
