# An adaptive system for the attenuation of an intentional disturbance applied to a phased array type radar with mechanical scanning.

## Abstract
System for the cancellation of directional disturbances jammers by means of processing the signals received from the radiating elements of a phased array radar planar antenna. For the formation of the radiating beam in a certain direction all the radiating elements are not combined amongst themselves some of these are combined separately in order to form auxiliary beams that allow the estimation of the disturbance which is present in the main beam and its removal from it. The system according to the invention does not therefore require the placement of auxiliary antennas around the main antenna and, much less, the use of multiple processing channels in the case when it is desired to control in amplitude and phase all the elementary radiators of the phased array. The signal coming from the main channel, with the effects of the disturbance removed can be further processed with the usual techniques that are used with radar receivers to detect the presence of targets and evaluate their kinemat ic parameters.

## Description
An Adaptive System for the Attenuation of an Intentional DisturbanceApplied to a Phased Array Type Radar With Mechanical Scanning DESCRIPTIONThe performance of a phased array radar can be notably reduced by the reception, from its antenna side lobes, of disturbances that originate from different directions in space jammer . The purpose of the present invention is that of providing a system for the spatial filtering of these disturbances.Up to now two methods of notably different complexity and performance have been adopted.The first method which is an extension of the one used for radar antennas having mechanical scanning, consists in the placing around the phased array antenna one or more auxiliary antennas that in turn receive the disturbances. In Figure 1 is presented an example of such a method that considers two auxiliary antennas with phased centers 0 and 0 placed 1 2 near a phased array antenna with phase center 0. Signals al and a that 2 come frome these auxiliary antennas are first multiplied by appropriate coefficients weights that modify their phase and amplitude and then are added to each other.The resulting signal, that is an estimate of the received disturbances from the phased array antenna is removed at the output of the lattcr malting it therefore . e Of disrbances. Thet is also equivalent to a reduction in gain of the main antenna in the directions from which come the disturbances themselves.This method requires the use of a number of antenna at least equal to the number of jammers that are to be filtered, of an equal number of receiving channels that make available the received signals in the frequency band most suitable for their processing and of an equal number of circuits for the weight calculations.The performance of a system of this kind is limited by the non null distances CO and OO between the phase centers of the main antenna and the 1 2 auxiliary antennas that cause a decorrelation between the signals main and auxiliary produced by a one and only same disturbance J that travels diverse distances and strikes the various antennas with a diverse phase.This decorrelation also increases with the increase of the disturber band.In the case of figure 1 the time delay of the received wave of the two phase centers 0 and Ol is equal to 00 Sin e Cos f c where c is equal to the velocity of light and 8 and T are tne polar angular coordinates of the jammer with respect to a reference system fixed with the antenna plane.An analogous delay is obtained for the waves received from the phase centers 0 and O. Such time delays, proportioned to the disturber band, produce a phase displacement and therefore decorrelation between the main and auxiliary signals with a resulting reduction of the cancellation system performance. Such decorrelation phenomena can be reduced by decreasing the distance between the auxiliary antenna and the main antenna.Nevertheless, in the case of figure 1 the auxiliary antennas can be, at the most, brought near to the edge of the main antenna.A second method consists in the modification of the amplitudes and phases of the received signals of all the elementary radiators of which the phased array antenna is equipped and then combining then such as tc still have a beam in a specified direction of interest and at the same fme spatially filtering the disturbances reducing the gain iri their di ectiori jf origin. This method even though it allows Me callceilaci rl 3f greater number of disturbances, requires an extremely elevated equal to the number of elementary radiators of the phased array number of processing channels and circuits for the calculation of the weights.Instead, the system which is the object of the present invention allows the spatial filtering of the disturbances using, in order to form the auxiliary signals, some of the radiating elements of the phased array antenna. Therefore, the afore mentioned distances between the phase centers of the antennas main and auxiliary are inferior to those of the first method and allow for the obtaining of higher cancellation values.Moreover, the system according to the present invention requires few cancellation circuits as many as are the auxiliary antennas used in alternative to the second method that requires a number equal to the elementary radiators of the phased array antenna.The present invention will now be described with reference to one of its actually preferred realization form and presented as a non limitative illustration on the basis of the figures of the enclosed designs, in which Figure 1 shows the general arrangement of a system for the cancellation of disturbances in a phased array radar by means of external auxiliary antennas Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the system for the cancellation of disturbances utilizing auxiliary antennas internal to the phased array.Figure 3 shows criteria for the choice of the radiating elements of the phased array to form two auxiliary beams of the cancellation system and details of block 6 shown in figure 2.Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the disturbance cancellation system with two auxiliary channels.Figure 5 shows the block diagram of the circuit for the estimation of the disturbances in the main channel block 24 Figure 4 .In figure 2 is shown the principle outline that permits the power reduction relative Lu LIie dil et .,iondl dist ur banccs received from the side lobes of a phased array antenna.The radar antenna is made up of a planar phased array 1 that can either be fixed or mechanically rotating in the azimuth direction.The signals intercepted by all the elementary antennas 2 with the exclusion of those necessary for the formation of the auxiliary beams are linearly combined, that is, are multiplied by weights independent of the received signals and then summed by means of block 5 to furnish in reception the principal signal s.The weights of the linear combinations are normally obtained by means of phase shifters located after the small antennas 2. The main beam can explore the space surrounding the antenna either by means of an eventual mechanical rotation of the array or controlled by a suitable time law of the phase shifters associated to antenna 2.Some of the radiating elements of the phased array do not participate in the formation of the main beam but are combined separately in order to form by means of block 6 auxiliary beams having a gain comparable to the average level of the lateral lobes of the main beam. By means of system 7 the auxiliary beams furnish signals a1, a2, a n that permit the cancellation of the disturbances present in the main channel.The radiating elements that make up the auxiliary beams only receive, while those that contribute to the formation of the main beam both receive and transmit.Consequently, it is necessary by means of duplexer 3 to decouple transmitter 4 from receiving chains 5 and 7.Block 4 can be a high power transmitter or else an amplifier driver for the single radiating elements according to whether the phased array is either active or else passive.An example of how to choose the radiating elements for forming two auxiliary beams and obtaining signals a ann a is shown in figure 3. It is first necessary to establish how many radiating elements have to be combined together in order to obtain an auxiliary beam that has a gain level comparable to that of the side lobes of the main beam. For example, assume that the phased array antenna could have a total number M of elements equal to 3000, to which corresponds a main beam with gain G of about 40 dB G lr M . Let us also assume that the level of the side lobe is 23 dB below the gain of the main lobe.Then to form an auxiliary beam that has a 17 dB gain it is sufficient to combine 16 radiating elements. Successive y,it will be established how many auxiliary beams one wishes to create.The number of auxiliary beams is equal to the number of disturbances that are to be cancelled and to the cancellation performance that one wishes to obtain such a number nevertheless should not be so high as to defocus the main beam.Still remaining is the need to establish the position of the groups of the radiating elements that make up the auxiliary beams.These positions should be very close to the main antenna phase center in order to reduce the decorrelation effect, by distance difference, whose reference is made by illustrating Figure 1.Nevertheless, it is also necessary that the auxiliary antennas be sufficiently distanced between themselves such that electromagnetic coupling phenomena that could make them functionally interdependent not be formed and therefore unable to separately cancel disturbances that are different between themselves.Finally, the choice of the number of auxiliary beams and their position is made case by case as a function of the type of phased array which is available and the cancellation performances that one wishes to obtain on a pre established disturbance configuration.The Igral r cEivc d by the radiating c,ror.ts he auxiliary beam are first amplified by devices 8 and 9 and therefore converted to a frequency that in general can be different from that one relative to the successive intermediate frequency stages, by means of the local oscillators 11 and 13 and the batteries of mixer 10 and 12.The signals, prior to being summed by means of devices 16 and 17, are phase shifted by means of phase shifter batteries 14 and 15 in order to create auxiliary beams having a radiation diagram that shifts in time with the main beam and therefore always covers its side lobes.In figure 4 is presented in detail the structure of block 7 in which is noted the presence of an adaptive cancellation loop whose purpose is to minimize the effect of the disturbance on the main channel.The cancellation should be accomplished by an adaptive mode, realizing the fact that the direction of origin and the disturbance intensity are not known and that the spatial configuration of the antenna jammer is not stationary in time due to the antenna rotation, the variation of the antenna side lobes and the movement of the jammers themselves .This objective is obtained by means of disturbance estimator 24 that utilizes the output s1 signal and the signals of the two auxiliary channels al and a2.The diagrams of figure 4 and of the successive figure 5 can be easily generalized if the auxiliary antennas are more than two.In order to obtain signals free of disturbances the estimator output is subtracted from signals of the main channel by means of block 25. Pass band filter 26 is adapted to the useful signal to be displayed, that is,to the echo originating from the target. This is useful for frequency filtering the disturbances that generally have a power spectrum with a band greater than the radar receiver.The processing of singals s, a and a is carried out by analogical means, it should nevertheless be noted thae These are no limitations of principle TC zne use ol digi al recnniq ss. The processing is carried out at an intermediate frequency in order to reduce the possibility of functioning error of the estimator of which will be spoken of when illustrating figure 5.This also allows the direct use of signal s available in the radar system, moreover, mixer 22 and local oscillator 23 could be not necessary because they are already present in the radar system prior to block 7.Figure 5 illustrates in detail the diagram of block 24, that is, the disturbance estimator that works on channel s.The output signal of estimator 24 is obtained by summing, by means of adder 33, the signals coming from beams a1 and a2. The amplitudes and the phases of these signals are suitably modified by means of mixer 31 and 32 that respectively receive the output signals from the two narrow band filters 28 and 30.The signals at the output of these two narrow band filters are non other than the correlation between the feedback signal s and the signals originating from beams a1 and a2.In fact, the correlations are obtained by respectively multiplying signals s with al and s with a2 by means of mixer 27 and 29 and then a time integration by means of filter 28 and 30 that have a time constant much longer than the jammer s smallest variational period, that is, a band much more narrower than that filter 26. Moreover, the estimation of the disturbance operating on s is non other than the sum of the received signals from the auxiliary beams a1 and a2 multiplied by correlation coefficients between the auxiliary beams themselves and the residual of cancellation s .The presence of the two auxiliary channels a1 and a in estimator 24 permits the effects produced by two independent disturbances to be evaluated separately, or better, to evaluate with greater precision the effect produced from a single jammer. The cancellation system therefore ar a p that increase with the number of auxiliary antenn and as such can counter a greater number of jammers or else, in a more efficient manner, a sole disturber with a wide functioning band.What has been previously stated can be generalized to the case of more auxiliary antennas and to a minor number of disturbers.The last can be thought of as being made up of a number equal to that of the auxiliary antennas, but having a smaller operating band.The reason for the insertion of the disturbance cancellation system 7 figure 2 at the intermediate frequency stage will be now clarified.In principle the disturbance cancellation can be carried out on the video signals that have a carrier at null frequency consequently, the cross correlators of figure 5 can be implemented with low pass filters rather than with pass band filters.Nevertheless, this type of realization is very sensitive to continuous undesired components drifts that can be produced by mixers 27 and 29.These drifts alter the optimum value of the correlation coefficients that multiply al and a2 and therefore drastically reduce the system cancellation. A means of filtering the drifts consists in realizing the cross correlators with pass band filters that do not allow the passage of the continuous components and therefore making the entire system function at an intermediate frequency.It is moreover observed that an ulterior realization form can also be obtained with reflector type antennas having purely mechanical scanning.In this case the auxiliary antennas come out of small apertures made in the internal parts of the reflector.The present invention has been described with reference to its actual preferred realization form but it should be understood that in practice variations and modifications can be introduced by an expert in the field without leaving the protection bounds of the present industrial patent.
