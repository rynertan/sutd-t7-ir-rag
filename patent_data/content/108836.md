## Description
ARTICLES DESTINATED FOR DEVICES COMPRISING A FUEL ENGINE AND USE OF A POLYAMIDE FOR SUCH ARTICLES The invention relates to articles destinated for devices which comprise a fuel engine. Articles made of polyamide materials are commonly known in the art.Such articles can however only be used to a very limited extend for applications in devices which comprise a fuel engine, i.e. in applications in which the articles are destinated to be subjected to increased temperatures, to stresses and or to environments that are generally detrimental for polyamides like fuel ingredients such as in particular methanol and certain ion species such as in particular combinations of zinc and chloride ions .It has now been found surprisingly that when using certain specific polyamide polymers for said applications, the stated drawbacks are considerably reduced or even avoided. The polyamides used in accordance with this invention for making articles destinated for a device comprising a fuel engine are polymers of tetramethylene diamine and adipic acid or copolymers there of with other amide and or ester forming compounds. The polymers can contain additives normally used wit polyamides, such as stabilizers, antioxidants, sliding agents, whitening agents etc. In addition to tetramethylene diamine and adipic acid, up to 20 wt of other amide and or ester forming compounds may have been incorporated in the polymer. The polymers may in particular consist of polytetramethylene adipamide which is being referred to as nylon 4,6 as a homopolymer or substantially homopolymer, or of copolymers of tetramethylene diamine and adipic acid with up to 20 wt. of lactams such as caprolactam and lauric lactam, amino acids, other diamines such as hexamethylene diamine, other dicarboxylic acids such as svocinic acid, sebacic acid, isophtalic acid and terephtalic acid and or diols such as ethyleneglycol. The used polymers should preferably have a relative viscosity value, as measured at 20 OC on a solution in 96 sulfuric acid containig I g of polyamide in 100 ml of solution, of at least 2 and first preferably between 3 and 5. The use of the polyamides in accordance with the invention is specifically recommended for Articles which are destinated to be subjected to increased temperatures or stress, and in particular articles which are destinated to be subjected to stress under increased temperature this is for instance the case for machine or vehicle parts under the hood of or close to a combustion engine. Articles which are destinated to be subjected to alcohol containing environments, such as in particular methanol this is for instance the case for articles which are liable to come in contact with alcohol in particular methanol containing engine fuels. Articles which are destinated to be subjected to zinc and or chloride ion environments this is for instance the case for machine or vehicle parts which are placed in an environment where there are also galvanized Zn metal parts and a medium which contains chloride ions for instance see water road salts etc . The use of the polyamides according to the invention is very particularly recommended for articles which are destinated to be subjected to stresses of more than 3 N mm2 under alcohol and or zinc chloride containing environments. The expression device which comprises a fuel engine as used in this specification is intented to include any kind of device, either stationary, movable or self propelled which is provided with a fuel engine such expression is in particular intented to cover fuel engine machines and devices of any kind, and fuel engine bearing or propelled vehicles of any kind such as motor cars, air planes, boats etc.The invention will be now elucidated in more detail by means of examples of specific polyamide materials, having regard to the unexpected properties thereof in respect of the scope of articles for which they are destinated in accordance with this invention. Example 1 Hot water steam and thermal stability of injection moulded polyamide test bars. The hot water steam stability and the thermal stability of nylon 4.6 was compared to that of nylon 6 and nylon 6.6 using the, ISOR 527 standard test method. Test bars for the tensile strength measurements were injection moulded from samples of the following unstabilised polyamides Nylon 6 Ultramid B3 which is a trade mark of BASF Nylon 6.6 Ultramid A3 which is a trade mark of BASF Nylon 4.6 a polytetramethylene adipamide sample having a relative viscosity value 3.4. The test bars were moulded using a standard laboratory injection moulding machine. For nylon 6 and nylon 6.6 the moulding conditions were in accordance with those set forth by the supplier.For nylon 4.6 a nozzle temperature of 310 OC and a mould temperature of 80 OC were used, and an injection pressure of 1500 atm. and an after injection pressure of 370 atm. The ageing of the testbars was carried out in an autoclave at 120 OC under water steam atmosphere under nitrogen pressure for the hot water steam stability test and in an air oven at 1200 for the thermal stability tests the time after which tensile strength fell to 50 of its initial value was determined. The results of these measurements are represented in table 1.Table 1 Hot water steam thermal stability stability time to decrease time to decrease of tensile strength of tensile strength to 50 to 50 Nylon 4.6 7 weeks 5 weeksNylon 6.6 about 5 weeks about 2i weeksNylon 6 about 4 weeks about 25 weeks Example 2 Stress crack resistance of injection moulded testbars in zinc chloride environment. The stress crack resistance in zinc chloride environment of nylon 4.6 was compared to that of nylon 6 and nylon 6.6 using test bars of 120 mm length, 12,7 mm width and 1,6 mm thickness. The testbars were injection moulded from the same materials as used in example 1. The testbars were first conditionned to an equilibrium humidity corresponding to 50 relative humidity at 23 OC and subsequently aged in a 50 weigth solution of zinc chloride in water, under a constant loading of 3 N mm2. The time to fracturing of the testbars was determined. The results of this experiment are represented in table 2. Table 2 Fracture times of test bars under 3 N mm2 in a 50 wt solution of ZnC12 Nylon 4.6 240 hoursNylon 6 about 10 minutesNylon 6.6 about 15 minutesExample 3 Stress crack resistance of injection moulded testbars in methanol environment. The stress crack resistance in methanol of nylon 4.6 was compared to that of nylon 6 and nylon 6.6. with test bars as used for example 2. The testbars were first dried at a temperature of 23 OC and then provided with a side notch of 1,5 mm 1 mm of Izod notch and 0,5 mm of rasor blade notch . The testbars were subsequently aged in methanol under a constant loading of 24 N mm2. The time to fracturing was determined. The results of this experiment are represented in table 3.
