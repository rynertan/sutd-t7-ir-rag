Formulations Useful formulations of the compound of Formula I can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20X surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s .More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table I Weight Percent Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactantfs Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a surfactant or a diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, NewJersey, but other solids. either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden. Solvents Guide. 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York. 1950.Solubility under 0.1S is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at O C.

It controls a broad spectrum of broadleaf weeds with outstanding crop safety. Since it is rapidly dissipated in soil. it may be used in double cropping situations or where crops sensitive to herbicides now used in cereal crops will follow the cereal. The rates of application are from 8 to 125 g ha.The exact rate used will depend on the weeds to be controlled, and their stage of growth, the crop, the climate, other herbicides used in combination with it, formulation, etc. The exact rate to be used may be selected by one with ordinary skill in the art. This compound may be used with other compounds selective on cereal crops including other sulfonylureas, the diarylethers, the ureas, the triazines and the carbamates.

For postemergence treatments, the first tray was planted 14 days before spraying. and the second tray was planted 24 days before treatment. Plants in the postemergence treatments ranged in height from 1 to 15 cm depending on specie. Wheat. barley, and wild oats were in the 2 leaf stage of development Zadoks Stage 11 . A second set of trays were prepared in an identical manner before spraying to service as preemergence treatments. Herbicides were diluted in a non phytotoxic solvent and applied to the trays using a belt sprayer. Additionally, three other species were evaluated Veronica hederaefolia, chickweed Stellaria media andViola arvensis. These plantings were grown in five inch pots containing the same soil as described previously. The plants were grown for 22 days before treatment, Herbicide application was made in a similar manner as the screening trays. Plants were grown in the greenhouse for 21 days at which time visual ratings were made by comparing to an untreated control treatment. Ratings were based on a scale of o no effect to 100 complete kill.
