# Valve mechanism.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a desmodromic valve op erating mechanism, i.e. one in which the valve is mechanically closed instead of relying on the action of a spring. The valve operating mechanism comprises a cam 20 driven in synchronism with the engine crankshaft. A cam follower 18 is acted upon by an opening profile 22 of the cam 20 and serves to move the valve 10 in an opening direction. A movable closing member 26 has two profiles 24, 28. The first profile 24 interacts with the cam 20 and the second 28 with the cam follower 18. Closure of the valve is effected by the open ing profile 22 of the cam 20 acting on the first cam profile 24 of the closing member 26 to move the closing member 26 in such a direction that the second cam profile 28 of the closing member 26 acts on the cam follower 18 to close the valve 10.
