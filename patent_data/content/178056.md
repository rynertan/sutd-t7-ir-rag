# Lock assembly.

## Abstract
A lock assembly has a lock barrel 16 which slides in a housing 10 so that a finger 18 at the end of the barrel 16 can release a latch. The lock barrel is prevented from sliding when the barrel is locked, by engagement of the finger 18 with a blocking plate 22 , but the barrel is freed when the key is inserted and turned. The finger 18 is made so that it shortens if excessive axial force is applied while the barrel is locked. This shortening may be effected by including an easily rupturable connection between different sections of the finger. When the finger shor tens, the connection ruptures and prevents the finger 18 from getting near the latch to release it. Once the connection has ruptured, further movement of the barrel 16 into the housing 10 will bring the barrel into contact with the outer periphery of the blocking plate 22 which is well supported.
