# STEPPER MOTOR MOTION SENSOR

## Abstract
The response of a stepper motor to the energizing of the motor s stator windings by excitation signals presented in each motor step interval, is detected by measuring the amplitude of the voltage signal induced in a non energized stator winding as a result of the presentation of the excitation signals to the energized stator windings.
