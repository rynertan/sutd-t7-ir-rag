# Data logging device.

## Abstract
A data logging device comprises a data memory unit 11 and a transducer interface unit 1 . The data memory unit has an internal power source 12 , an integrated circuit memory component 23 for storing data under the control of a microprocessor 18 in the memory unit, means 14, 21 for indicating the amount of data stored in the memory compo nent and the power source state. A connector component 19 connects the memory component to recieve data from the transducer interface unit. The transducer interface unit 1 has a plurality of ports 2 for connection of remote trans ducers and means 5 for translating signals received from the ports into data signals which can be transferred to the memory component in the data memory unit through a con nector component 9 connected to the connector compo nent 19 of the data memory unit. The data memory unit 11 and the transducer interface unit 1 have interengaging surfaces 101, 111 in which the respective connector com ponents are located assymetrically so that the data memory unit and the transducer interface unit can be coupled to form an integral unit in only one relative orientation with the in terengaging surfaces of the units coupled together.
