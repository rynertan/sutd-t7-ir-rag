# A process for improving the tear strength of water laid cellulose paper sheets and a water laid cellulose paper sheet so prepared.

## Abstract
Paper having improved properties, particularly tear strength, is prepared from a furnish containing at least 90 weight of cellulose fibers and up to 10 weight of ole fin polymer fibrils. The fibrils are prepared by a differential temperature process of the type described in U.S. 4 013 751, are refined in isopropanol, and are treated with an aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol to sorb at least 1,0 weight of polyvinyl alcohol on the fibrils. The fibrils are prepared from an olefin polymer having a weight average molecular weight of at least one 1 million.
