## Description
NON STAINING, NON STICKING STYRENIC POLYMERS AND METHOD OF PREPARATION The present invention relates to styrenic polymers, and specifically to non staining, non sticking styrenic polymers. It is well known in the art to produce various shaped articles from polystyrene monomers. These articles, however, suffer from an assortment of defects, such as low resistance to fat containina foods, i.e., low environmental stress crack resistance to fatty acids, oils and grease, which act as a cracking agent. It is now known that polymers containing paramethylstyrene PMS , and especially high impact poly pmethylstyrene HIPPMS overcome the above mentioned defects and are advantageous in other areas as well. See, for example, A BetterStyrene Goes Commercial , Chemical Week, February 17, 1982, pages 42 46. Even though there are characteristic advantages of one styrenic polymer over another, there are some disadvantages which are common to all styrene polymers. For example, many styrenic polymers are susceptible to staining by staining agents, such as oil, grease or fatty acids. Additionally, while many of the characteristics of HIPPMS are superior to other styrenes, HIPPMS is particularly susceptible to staining, presumably due to the high affinity of the methyl groups in HIPPMS towards fatty acids, etc. The staining agents initiate the staining process when they are applied to the polymer surface, which is followed by diffusion or plasticization through the hulk of the copolymer. Thus, the surface of the styrenic polymer plays a significant role in whether or not the polymer will be stained. It has been discovered that styrenic copolymers can be synthesized in situ with siloxanes, preferably having a molecular weight in excess of 20,000, in order to form a non removable, non staining, non sticking surface on the base styrenic copolymer. Accordingly, the present invention provide, a non staining, non sticking styrenic copolymer free of polyphenylene oxide and comprising in combination 90 to 99.9 weight of a base styrenic copolymer and 0.1 to 10 weight of a siloxane, based on the total weight of the base styrenic copolymer and siloxane. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of forming these non staining, non sticking styrenic copolymers. Nbn sticking, non staining styrenic polymers may be prepared from a variety of styrenic copolymers. For example, it is within the scope of this invention to employ polystyrene PS , and particularly high impact polystyrene HIPS , as the basic styrenic copolymer for use in this invention. A summary of the preparation and properties of styrene is given in Styrene Its Polymers,Copolymers and Derivatives , Ed. R. H. Boundy, R. F. Boyer, A. C. S.Monograph Series, 1952, Hafner Publishing Co., pages 1232 1245. Random copolymers may be made with a wide range of comonomers including other vinyl monomers, such as styrene, alpha methylstyrene, acrylates, including methylacrylate, ethylacrylate, methacrylates, including methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, olefins, especially diolefins such as butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene and mono olefins, such as ethylene and propylene. A more favored class of copolymers contain as an essential monomer component in preparing the base styrenic copolymer p methylstyrene. It is within the contemplation of this invention to use mixtures of methylstyrene isomers rich in p methylstyrene.Such mixtures contain at least 90 weight percent, preferably 95 weight percent, more preferably 97 or greater weight percent p methylstyrene and less than 0.1 weight percent o methylstyrene, with the balance being m methylstyrene. A typical mixture contains, by weight, about 97 percent p methylstyrene, about 3 percent m methylstyrene, and about 0.05 percent o methylstyrene. The mixtures are obtained by catalytic dehydrogenation of the mixtures of ethylemthyl benzene isomers described in U. S. Patent No.4,086,287. Homopolymers and copolymers prepared from p methylstyrene are prepared in the known manner utilizing methods analogous to those long used for the preparation of polystyrene and styrene copolymers. The preparation of p methylstyrene polymers and random copolymers of styrene and p methylstyrene is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,306,049. Another favored class of copolymers are high impact copolymers of poly p methylstyrene . The high impact copolymers of poly p methylstyrene , e.g., HIPPMS, are generally graft copolymers produced by grafting units derived from the polymerizable mixture onto a generally rubbery backbone polymer. Suitable backbone polymers include polybutadiene, poly dimethylbutadiene , polyisoprene, polychioroprene and other synthetic rubbers, such as styrene butadiene rubber, ethylene propylene rubbers, ethylene propylene diene elastomers, polyacrylates, nitrile rubbers and copolymers with other aromatic monomers, including vinyltoluene. The backbone generally comprises 2 25 by weight of the high impact copolymer, preferably 3 10S by weight.Normal techniques, e.g., grafting, comparable to those used for making high impact polystyrenes are useful they are well known in the art and referred to, for example, in U. S. Patent No. 2,694,692 and BritishPatent No. 1,054,301. The high impact copolymers of the present invention were prepared by the proper use of p methylstyrene in combination with a comonomer, i.e., styrene or methyl methacrylate, in the presence of a diene or saturated type rubber. Preferred examples of the rubber are polybutadiene having a 7 1,2 35 55 cis and 35 50 trans microstructure, polyisoprene, high cis 1,4 polybutadiene having a 98 cis, 2 1,2 microstructure, ethylene propylene diene terpolymer EPDM , 6rt butyl rubber. It is within the contemplation of this invention o incorporate other rubbers into the formation of the high impac copolymer of the present invention. re surface characteristics of the styrenic base copolymers are improved by the addition of siloxanes to the copolymer. Silo anes are silica based polymers having repeating units of the formula ER2Si0 n in w ich R is an alkyl group, usually methyl, and n is a number from 10 tc 200. Siloxanes are known to have very low surface free energy values of about 21 22 dyne cm. Low molecular weight siloxanes, e.g. molecular weight number average less than 10,000, are used as silicon oils in order to enhance surface lubrication, e.g., an external lubricant. Higher molecular weight siloxanes, e.g., molecular weight greater than 20,000, have a viscosity which varies from about 20,000 to about 3 million centistokes.It is preferred to us thigh molecular weight siloxanes in the present invention because the are not readily removed from the surface of the styreic base copolymers. Additionally, high molecular weight siloxnes maintain a high glass transition temperature Tg of the matri to gve extra rubber functionality to the styrenic base copolymer. A preferred siloxane for the present invention is poly dime nylsi oxane PDMS , although other siloxanes may be used. Due to the large difference in surface free energy values between styreric copolymers and siloxanes, PDMS is incompatible with PPMS, PS, and copolymers of PMS and styrene. Because of this, PDMS readily diffuses to he surface, thus imparting a permanent non sticking, non stainin surface. 1 melt blending and 2j in situ polymerization. In melt blending , the styrene base copolymer, e.g.,HIPPMS or otner PMS, PS or other styrene base polymers, in an amount ranging from about 98 to about 99.8 by weight, are melt blended with siloxane, preferably POMS, at a temperature of approximately 200C for about 3 minutes. The final blend is then cooled and pelletized. In the in situ polymerization method, a mixture of PMS orPS, rubber, siloxane and 10 solvent V V is charged into a dissolver. The combination of PMS and rubber forms the HIPPMS copolymer blend, a preferred ingredient in the final product mixture. Suitable solvents are those which dissolve rubber in thePMS mixture, thus forming a high impact copolymer matrix. Examples of such solvents are paraethyltoluene PET and ethylbenzene. The mixture is allowed to dissolve in the dissolver for 1 to 4 hours until a clear solution is formed. At this point, the mixture is charged into a pregrafter and gently agitated at temperatures of between about 100 and 120C, preferably llOC. A peroxide catalyst is generally incorporated into the blend in order to reduce the blend temperature to about lOOC.Examples of peroxide catalysts include benzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, t butyl peroxyisobutyrate, p chlorobenzoyl peroxide, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 cis 2 etny 1 hexanoylperoxy hexane, and t butyl peroctoate. The copolymer will start to polymerize and chemically attach, i.e., graft, to the rubber until approximately 20 by weight of the mixture is formed into a suspension of a rubber grafted copolymer. The mixture is then polymerized at a higher temperature, i.e., 125 130C and preferably 130C. The temperature increase is necessary due to the increased viscosity of the rubber grafted polymer solution. The solution is allowed to polymerize until approximately 45 50 of the mixture forms a rubber grafted copolymer mixture. At this point, the mixture is charged to a static reactor which preferably operates at a still higher temperature. The mixture is allowed to gently agitate at a temperature of approximately 130 140C until 70 75 of the solution is converted to a solid rubber grafted copolymer. The other 25 30 of the solution forms the remaining solvent and any unreacted comonomers. when a 75 80 solid level is reached, the solvent and any unreactec omonomer from the rubber grafted polymer is removed in a devolatizer, which operates under temperature conditions of 200 220C, and preferably 210C, and a pressure of 15 20 mmHg. The unreacted solvents and comonomers may be further processed into additional cycles of the high impact copolymer formation. The high impact copolymer is hydrostatically removed from the devolatizer and allowed to cool at ambient temperature. The cooled high impact copolymer s then pelletized. Thie polymerization process may also be performed in the following manner siloxane is dissolved in the styrene copolymer with rubber and polymerized at a temperature of approximately llOC for about 4 hours. The polymerization temperature is then increased to l40C for approximately 10 more hours. The final polymer is then devolatized, cooled, pelletized and characterized for rubber and siloxane leels. The resulting polymer blends contain from 90 to 99.92 weight , and preferably from 98 to 99.8 weight , styrene polymer, and from 0. to 10 by weight siloxane, and preferably from 0.2 to 2 by weigh. Without wishing to adhere to any one set theory, it is believed that one reason that siloxanes form a non sticking, non staininc coating on styrene base copolymer blends is due to the differences in surface free energy between siloxanes and the polymer blend. For example, PDMS with a trimethyl siloxy terminal group has a surface free energy of about 21 dyne cm, while PPMS has a surface free energy of about 28 dyne cm. As a result, the siloxane will diffuse to the surface of the polymer blend and form a thin, permanent coating. This will decrease the surface stickiness and will enhance the releasability of the polymer from the mold.Because the surface energy is lowered, the surface will not be stained by crease or any other agent which has equal or larger surface energy. Scanning electron microscopy on the freeze fractured cut surfaces of a molded polymer blend of the present invention showed that siloxane appears in the bulk of the polymer in spherical morphology with particle size of about 5 6 microns. It is also within the scope of this invention to incorporate PDMS with OH terminal groups and hydride terminal groups to high impact polymer blends with a very low concentration of tin octoate catalyst. During the injection molding, the articles will form and the surface will be coated with slightly cross linked polysiloxane. Therefore, solvent and fatty acid resistance of the polymer blend will be improved and the environmental stress crack resistance characteristics will be enhanced. A thin layer of cross linked siloxane will enhance the surface resistance to fatty acids and solvents and will also impart a pleasing glossy appearance to the surface of the molded polymer product. Examples 1 6 are designed to determine the critical surface tension on the surfaces of styrene polymers and styrene polymer siloxane blends. Proportion, and percentage, are given by weight. The polymer blends were prepared in a one stage in situ polymerization reactor in the following manner poly dimethyl siloxane molecular weight 400,000 was dissolved in the styrene polymer with cis 1,4 poly butadiene rubber, ethylbenzene and benzoyl peroxide and reacted at a temperature of llOC for approximately 4 hours. The temperature was raised to 140C and the polymer blend was allowed to react in this environment for another 10 hours. The resulting polymer blend was devolatized at a temperature of 210C, cooled and pelletized. Control samples contained no siloxane. X ray fluorescence techniques were used to determine the actual level of siloxane in the polymer and the siloxane content was calculated. Because high molecular weight siloxanes are part of the bulk of the polymer, the calculated and experimental levels are in agreement. Tests performed on the surface of a molded styrene article revealed that the surface of the molded article is hDmogeneously covered by by siloxanes. Measurements of critical surface tension were also performed on the molded articles by theZisman method.The resulting polymer blend for each Example, as well as their corresponding critical surface tension measurements, may be found on Table 1 as follows TABLE 1Example 1 2 3 4 5 6Polymer Blend Polymer Type HIPPMS HIPPMS HIPPMS HIPS HIPS HIPS wt. g 500 498 499 500 498 499 Ethylbenzene g 60 60 60 60 60 60 Rubber 9 40 36 39 40 36 39 Benzoyl Peroxide ppm 200 200 200 200 200 200 PDMS g 0 6 2 0 6 2 wt. 0 1.0 0.38 0 1.0 0.38Critical Surface Tension dyne cm 29 22 23 31 24 26 TM Polysar Controls The following examples were designed to test theEnvironmental Stress Crack Resistance ESCR of the polymer blend. ESCR is a standard laboratory method for measuring the resistance of a strand of polymer to tensile pressure after the area of highest stress concentration generally the center point of the strand has been exposed to an oil environment. Representative oils include butter, margarine, cottonseed oil or salad oil. The ESCR in these examples were tested by providing the point of greatest stress on the polymer strands with mixtures of hydrogenated fatty acids. For these examples, CHIFFON Reg. TM brand margarine was used. The polymers were then tested at 7,000 kPa 1,000 psi . Example 7 tested the control HIPPMS without a blend polymer. Example 8 tested a blend of about 99 by weight HIPPMS and 1 by weight PDMS. Example 9 tested a blend of 0.5X by weight PDMS with OH terminal group and 0.5S by weight PDMS with H terminal group which was well blended into HIPPMS. Tin octoate was added as a cross linking agent into the blend at the last minute.The final chopped blend product was used to prepare a melt strand at 200C. The melt strands were stored for 3 days at ambient temperature and tested for ESCR. Measurements were made of the fail time, i.e., the time required in minutes for pressure at 7,000 kPa 1,000 psi to snap each polymer strand. The measurements of the resultant calends are shown in Table 2 TABLE 2Example Blend Fail Time Minutes 7 HIPPMS Control 8 13 8 HIPPMS 99 wt. PDMS 1 wt. 22 23 9 HIPPMS 99 wt. PDMSOH Term.

Two 100 ml. compression molded sheets were initially prepared by in situ polymerization. The sheets had the following properties Sheet Composition 1 100 HIPPMS Control 2 98.4 HIPPMS 1.6 PDMS 400,000 M.W. CHIFFON Reg. TM brand margarine was spread onto the surface of Sheets 1 and 2 at room temperature and allowed to remain there for 24 hours. Optical microscopy of the molded HIPPMS PDMS polymer after 24 hours indicated no significant penetration, and the staining agent was easily removed without leaving any stain on the surface of the polymer. Contact angle measurements Zisman method indicated no change in critical surface tension of the HIPPMS PDMS polymer before and after the staining agent application. However, the HIPPMS polymer blend without PDMS was noticeably stained as a result of the staining agent. Additionally, Instron Rheometer data showed that the presence of 1.6 by weight of PDMS in poly paramethylstyrene , polystyrene, HIPPMS and HIPS caused a 30 drop in viscosity of melt at 200C at low shear rate. Thus, PDMS acts as a slip indexing agent for the polymer blend and facilitates the mold release of the polymer blend.
