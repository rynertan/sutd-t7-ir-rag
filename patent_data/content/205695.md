# Gas conditioning crevice corrosion inhibitors.

## Abstract
Crevice corrosion in gas processing equipment using aqueous alkanolamine solutions to remove acid gases is inhibited by adding to and maintaining in the alkanolamine solution crevice corrosion inhibiting amounts of nickel ions and thiocyanate ions.

## Description
GAS CONDITIONING CREVICE CORROSION INHIBITORS This invention relates to a method for inhibiting crevice corrosion in acid gas removal equipment. It is well known from the prior art that acid gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and carbonyl sulfide can be removed from gaseous feed streams such as natural gas and synthesis gas using dilute aqueous solutions of potassium carbon ate, alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine, dieth anolamine, and methyldiethanolamine, and other weak bases. The usual procedure is to use a contactor wherein the absorbent solution contacts the feed stream countercurrently and to use a regenerator with a reboiler wherein the rich absorbent containing the acid gas component is regenerated back to the free absorbent. The solution is then pumped back to the contactor for reuse. There has been much activity devoted to solving the problem of general metallic corrosion in the equipment used in the above process. This problem is particularly acute and or chronic when mild steel alloys are used in the equipment to save on capital costs over the use of more exotic and expensive metal alloys such as stainless steel. It is, of course, common practice to use stainless steel and nickel alloys in sensitive areas such as heat exchange equipment.

US 4,102,804 July 25, 1978 provides for inhibition of sour gas conditioning solutions using minor amounts of a quaternary pyridinium salt, and a thiocyanate compound, a sulfide compound or a thioamide compound. US 4,116,629 September 26, 1978 provides for the corrosion inhibition of stainless steels types 410 and 430 when in contact with carbonate solutions by using nickel salts. US 4,143,119 March 6, 1979 provides for inhibition of sour gas conditioning solutions using minor amounts of copper and a pdlysulfide generated in situ. US 4,431,563 discloses a method of inhibiting general corrosion in gas conditioning apparatus whereby corrosion is inhibited by the use of thionitrogen compounds in combination with soluble metal salts such as nickel and cobalt salts. According to Fontana and Greene Corrosion Engineering , 2nd Edition, page 39, crevice corrosion is known as intense localized corrosion which occurs within crevices and other shielded areas on metal surfaces which are in a corrosive environment. This type of attack is usually associated with small volumes of stagnant solution which occur as a result of entrapment in between metal and gasket surfaces, lap joints, crevices under bolt heads, etc. Apparatus for detecting and measuring crevice corrosion are known from US 3,116,117 and 3,599,090. While the above compositions and or processes are effective for general corrosion, they do not teach or are they adequate for the inhibition of crevice corrosion. It now has been surprisingly discovered that the crevice corrosion of iron and steel in gas removal equipment can be effectively reduced by using a gas conditioning alkanolamine solution inhibited by effective amounts of a combination or a mixture of thiocyanate ions and nickel ions. The inhibitors used in this invention are constantly replenished or maintained in the gas conditioning solution in order to obtain effective passivation. The process claimed herein is unique in that it reduces crevice corrosion of all ferrous surfaces, i.e., not only mild steel but also stainless steel surfaces. The crevice corrosion inhibitors used in this invention are effective in aqueous solutions of alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, methyldiethanolamine and related alkanolamines that are commonly used to remove acid gases from gas streams. The alkanolamines are used in an aque ous solution having 10 to 80 percent by weight of alkanolamines. The preferred range is 20 to 60 percent and the most preferred range is 30 to 50 percent by weight. The impure gaseous feed streams which can be treated with the inhibited gas conditioning solutions of this invention to remove carbon dioxide can generally contain no more than a few parts per million 1 5 ppm of hydrogen sulfide and or carbonyl sulfide. Examples of soluble nickel compounds useful to provide the nickel ions are nickelous sulfate, nitrate, acetate, tartrate, citrate, carbonate, and thiocyanate. Since nickel usually behaves as a divalent metal, all references to nickel salts hereinafter are meant to include nickelous salts. Examples of soluble thiocyanate compounds useful to provide the thiocyanate ions are ammonium thiocyanate, alkali metal thiocyanates such as potassium thiocyanate and sodium thiocyanate, alkaline earth metal thiocyanates, and transition metal thiocyanates. Nickel thiocyanate is particularly useful and or convenient since it supplies both the required ions in one compound. It is to be noted that the terms soluble compound or salt means for the purpose of this invention that the compound is sufficiently soluble in the aqueous gas conditioning solution, i.e., aqueous alkanolamine to be useful herein. Generally, this means the salt or compound must be soluble to the extent of 25 ppm or greater. It has been found that for carbon steel equipment, the thiocyanate inhibitors must be maintained in the gas conditioning solutions in amounts to supply from 150 ppm or greater of the thiocyanate ion. Since these compounds are depleted during use, large amounts of the compounds to provide 500 ppm or more of the thiocyanate ions can be used at start up and periodic additions can be made thereafter to maintain the required effective amounts in the solution. A range from 150 to 2,000 ppm of the thiocyanate ions has been found to be an effec tive amount and a range from 200 to 400 ppm is the preferred range. Amounts greater than 2000 ppm, while effective, are not economical. The nickel salts must be maintained in the gas conditioning solutions in amounts to supply from 100 ppm or greater of the nickel ions. A range from 100 to 2000 ppm has been found to be an effective amount and a range from 100 to 200 ppm is the preferred range. Amounts greater than 2000 ppm are also effective but not economical. When the inhibitors of this invention are used with stainless steel equipment, it has been found that the level of nickel ions can be lowered to at least 25 ppm. The expression ppm refers to parts per million by weight.Example 1 A test for crevice corrosion was devised by utilizing metal test coupons made from carbon steel SAE 1020 as the heat transfer surface for the evaluation. The test solution and its glass container was inverted and sealed against the coupon with an elastomeric O ring arid an electrically heated aluminum block under the coupon supplied a carefully controlled 1490C 3000F temperature to the test coupon which was transferred to the test solution giving a bulk solution temperature of 1020C 2160F . Crevice and general corrosion are both measured. after a test run of 7 days 168 hours .Microscopic examination was used for a determination of the rate of crevice formation and the depth and width thereof. Monoethanolamine was added to deionized water to make a test solution of 1000 cm3 containing 30 percent by weight of monoethanolamine MEA .The deionized water was saturated with CO2 prior to use. Nickel sulfate NiSO4 6ego and or ammonium thiocyanate was added to this test solution in sufficient amounts to give the concentrations set forth in Table I.
