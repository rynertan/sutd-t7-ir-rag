# Improved butterfly valve.

## Abstract
The butterfly valve includes a valve housing 1 with a bore defining a flow passage 2 and a closure disc 3 rotatably mounted around a transverse shaft so as to be moved between a closed position and a full open position. The peripheral sur face of the closure disc and the associated valve housing seat surface are both frusto conical surfaces defined by two cir cular cones. The closure disc shaft axis is offset. For a given value of the cone angle 2 of that circular cone defining the valve housing seat surface and a given position C of the closure disc shaft axis in an orthogonal system , , wherein one of the axis is the said cone axis, there is defined a valve butterfly seal plane where the closure disc seals en gages the valve housing seat, a couple of points of said seal plane, for which points the minimum clearance angle is maxi mum, projecting in a point Q located in the plane , of said orthogonal system, the coordinates of those points and the clearance being respectively given by the following ap proximated relations X The compression value ε at the fluid tight surfaces is The seal surface is generated by straight lines forming a given angle β with the generatrix of the first cone at any point of the ellipse E plane in the plane defined by the generatrix and the centre of the ellipse.
