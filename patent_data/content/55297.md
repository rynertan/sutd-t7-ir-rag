# MONITORING DEVICE FOR A ROTARY MACHINE.

## Abstract
A monitoring device for a rotary machine using FFT frequency spectrum analyzing system. The device selects spectral terms with larger amplitudes from the frequency spectrum calculated by the FFT frequency spectrum analyz ing system, arithmetically processes the data of spectrum amplitude distribution in the neighborhood of each of these higher amplitude frequencies, and thereby detects the amplitudes and corresponding frequencies relating to large oscillation inputs entered into a rotary machine. Thus, it is possible to monitor the presence of any abnormality in a rotary machine in its working field.
