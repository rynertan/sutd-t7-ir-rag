# Electromagnetic unit fuel injector.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic unit fuel injector for use in a multi cylinder diesel engine has an externally actuated pump 10, 11 for intensifying the pressure of fuel delivered to a pressure actuated injection valve 51 which controls flow discharge out through a spray outlet 53 and is normally biased to a closed position by a spring 65 . Pressurized fuel from the pump is also supplied via a throttling orifice 43 to a modulated pressure servo control chamber 56 having a servo piston means 62 operatively associated with the injection valve. A drain passage 66 extends from the servo control chamber, with flow therethrough controlled by a solenoid actuated control valve in the form of a poppet valve 68 which is normally biased to a closed position by a valve return spring 84 of predetermined force, whereby the control valve is also operative as a pressure relief valve. A secondary pressure relief valve means 133 is prefer ably additionally incorporated into the unit injector so that all of the unit injectors for the engine will operate at a uniform maximum peak pressure.
