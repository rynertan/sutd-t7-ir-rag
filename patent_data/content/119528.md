## Description
The present invention relates to the generation of monoclonal antibodies and their use in identifying or characterizing human renal cancer antigens. This is a useful diagnostic tool in the detection of renal cancer as well as the study of the nature of renal cancer. Red blood cells, immunofluorescent, radioactive or enzymatic tagging agents can be bound to the highly specific antibodies using normal procedures, as required for indexing methods. Cytotoxic agents can also be bound to the highly specific antibodies to produce so called magic bullet type therapeutic agents which selectively destroy the cell with which the specific antibody binds. In 1975 Köhler and Milstein introduced a procedure for the production of monoclonal antibodies mAbs using hybrid cells hybridomas which allows the production of almost unlimited quantities of antibodies of precise and reproducible specificity. Conventional antisera, produced by immunizing animals with tumor cells or other antigens, contain a myriad of different antibodies differing in their specificity and properties, whereas hybridomas produce a single antibody with uniform characteristics. The Köhler Milstein procedure entails the fusion of spleen cells from an immunized animal with an immortal myeloma cell line. From the fused cells hybridomas , clones are selected that produce an antibody of the desired specificity. Each clone continues to produce only that one antibody. As hybridoma cells can be cultured indefinitely or stored frozen in liquid nitrogen , a constant supply of antibody is assured. Antibodies are proteins that have the ability to combine with and recognize other molecules, known as antigens. Monoclonal antibodies are no different from other antibodies except that they are very uniform in their properties and recognize only one antigen or a portion of an antigen known as a determinant. In the case of cells, the determinant recognized is an antigen on or in the cell which reacts with the antibody. It is through these cell antigens that a particular antibody recognizes, i. e. reacts with, a particular kind of cell. Thus the cell antigens are These antigenic markers may be used to observe the normal process of cell differentiation and to locate abnormalities within a given cell system. The process of differentiation is accompanied by changes in the cell surface antigenic phenotype, and antigens that distinguish cells belonging to distinct differentiation lineages or distinguish cells at different phases in the same differentiation lineage may be observed if the correct antibody is available. Initial recognition of differentiation antigens came about through analysis of surface antigens of T cell leukemias of the mouse and the description of the TL, Thy 1, and Lyt series of antigens. Old, Lloyd J., Cancer Research, This is due to the difficulty of obtaining a ready source of the appropriate normal cell type as well as the vagaries of the art of monoclonal antibodies. The preparation of hybrid cell lines can be successful or not depending on such experimental factors as nature of the inoculant, cell growth conditions, hybridization conditions etc. Thus it is not always possible to predict successful hybridoma preparation of one cell line although success may have been achieved with another cell line. Progress in defining surface antigens on melanocytes was made possible by the recently discovered technique of culturing melanocytes from normal skin Eisinger, et. al., Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA, We recently described our initial analysis of cell surface antigens of human malignant melanoma identified by mouse monoclonal antibodies Abs Dippold et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 6114 6118 1980 . This invention relates to a comparable analysis of human renal cancer. Seventeen monoclonal antibodies derived from fusions with spleen cells of mice immunized with established culture lines of renal cancers identified nine cell surface antigenic systems Ueda, Ryuzo et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, These systems can be used to characterize and study the nature of renal cancer. Thus, comparison of the S₂₅ and gp160 phenotypes of different renal cancer cell lines and cultures of normal kidney clearly distinguish these two systems. Dippold et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA It has also been found that the cell lines derived from stage I renal cancer confined to the kidney are gp160 , whereas cell lines from metastatic renal cancers are gp160 . Whether this indicates that cancer cells developing metastatic potential lose gp160 expression, or that gp160 and gp160 renal cancers are derived from separate cell lineages is not determined however, identifying the cell types in normal kidney that express gp160 and other antigens found on renal cancer should give information about the cellular origins of renal cancer. These serological probes provided by the invention can identify kidney specific antigens and are of particular interest in the study of kidney structure and function. In addition, some of the more broadly reacting antibodies are useful in studying other tumors e. g. V₁ which distinguishes astrocytomas from melanomas. The importance of parallel biochemical and serological characterizations of antigens identified by Abs is illustrated by the analysis of gp120r and gp120nr. Five Abs in this series immunoprecipitated a 120,000 dalton component from labeled extracts of SK RC 7 renal cancer cells. Pre clearing the extract with one of these Abs AB S₆ removed the 120,000 dalton component identified by Ab S₂₃, indicating that the two Abs were reacting with the same molecule. However, the antigenic determinant detected by Ab S₆ and Ab S₂₃ can be distinguished in M MHA tests and absorption analysis. Ab S₂₃ detected a kidney specific antigen, whereas Ab S₆ reacted with a much broader range of cell types. These results can be explained by postulating two species of gp120 molecules, both carrying the epitope identified by Ab S₆ but only one with the epitope identified by Ab S₂₃. In agreement with this interpretation, supernatants after clearing with Ab S₂₃ still reacted with Ab S₆, even though no antigen precipitating with Ab S₂₃ remained. The epitope identified by Ab S₂₃ is found only on cells of renal origin, and, because of this restricted distribution, it is referred to as gp120r. The more widely distributed epitope has been designated nr to indicate its nonrestricted nature. gp120r and gp120nr may be the products of two separate genes or of a single gene whose product is modified in renal cells. Similar, although less striking, discrepancies in the cellular distribution of antigens identified by different monoclonal antibodies immunoprecipitating gp95 or gp150 molecules have also been explained on the basis of different epitopes being recognized Dippold, et al. Proc. Natl. Sci. USA 77, 6114 6118 1980 . The present invention relates to a monoclonal antibody and to the corresponding monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma cell line obtainable by fusing a myeloma derived cell strain and splenocytes derived from BALB c mice immunized with human normal renal epithelial cells, said monoclonal antibody being capable of recognizing human renal epithelial cancer cells. It especially relates to a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the human renal cell antigen gp140, said antigen gp140 being recognizable by the monoclonal reference antibody F23 ATCC HB 8231 . The new mAb, F23, is described below. F23 is part of a panel of monoclonal antibodies of renal origin used to detect renal cancer cells and antigens. This panel serves an important diagnostic function. The mAbs therein subset renal tumors and subset the normal nephron. The mAbs define renal antigens on normal cells, presumably differentiation antigens and define renal antigens present on tumors, thus distinguishing normal and cancerous renal cells. The monoclonal antibody designated F23 recognizes human renal cells and is produced by the hybridoma cell line deposited with the ATCC under Accession No. HB 8231. The present invention also relates to a method for differentiating between normal and malignant human renal cells which comprises contacting a human renal sample with a plurality of monoclonal antibodies each of which is different and each of which is produced by a hybridoma cell line formed by fusing a myeloma derived cell strain and splenocytes derived from BALB c mice immunized with established culture lines from the group of human epithelial renal cancer or normal human renal epithelial cells under suitable conditions so as to form a complex between each antibody and an antigen, detecting the presence of any so formed complex, the absence of any complex indicating normal renal cells and the presence of any complex indicating the presence of malignant human renal cells. In the above method the plurality of monoclonal antibodies can be selected from the group consisting of F₂₃, M₂, S₈ and S₂₁. The above method may further comprise contacting a human renal sample with a plurality of monoclonal antibodies selected from the group consisting of M₁, S₄, S₆, S₇, S₂₂, S₂₃, S₂₄, S₂₅, S₂₆, S₂₇ and V₁. It may be used as an assay for the malignant potential of human renal tumors. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by mixing a portion of the cell extract 1 x 10⁵ cpm with 2 µl of mouse serum and 20 µl of rabbit anti mouse Ig serum Cappel Laboratories, Cochranville, PA in Tris buffer . Immune complexes were isolated by using Staphylococcus aureus and analyzed by NaDodSO₄ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described Dippold et al supra . ³⁵S Methionine labeled samples were immunoprecipitated in a similar manner, except that Sepharose rabbit F ab ₂ anti mouse Ig was used for isolating the complexes. To determine the pI of the antigens, immunoprecipitates were examined by two dimensional electrophoresis by the O Farrell procedure O Farrell, P. H. Biol. Chem. 250, 4007 4021 1975 modified as described Ogata, et al supra . From the five fusions of NS 1 myeloma with three different renal cancer cell lines, 17 antibody producing clones were selected for detailed analysis Table 1 . The serological specificity of these antibodies was tested on a panel of 47 established cell lines 13 renal cancers, 5 melanomas, gliomas neuroblastomas, 15 epithelial cancers 5 B cell lines K562 an erythroid leukemia , 2 T cell lines MOLT 4 and T 45 , and monkey kidney cells VERO . In addition, the antibodies were tested against short term cultures of normal kidney epithelium, fibroblasts, and fetal tissues brain, fibroblasts, and kidney . Human, sheep, rat and bovine erythrocytes were also examined. In most cases, serological analysis consisted of both direct and absorption tests. These serological studies in conjunction with immunochemical analysis defined nine distinct antigenic systems. Three systems gp160, S₂₅, and gp120 were restricted to normal and malignant renal cells, three systems gp120nr, gp115, and V₁ were more widely distributed, and three systems werde identified as HLA A, B, C heavy chain and A and B blood group antigens. In frozen section Table II S4, S22 and S6 show specificity for kidney tumors. S₂₅ Five Abs S₂₃, S₂₆, S₂₇, S₆, and S₁ immunoprecipitated a 120,000 dalton glycoprotein from ³⁵S methionine or ³H glucosamine labeled lysates of SK RC 7 cells. Analysis under reducing and nonreducing conditions gave the same results. The pIs of gp120 identified by prototype Ab S₆ and Ab S₂₃ were identical 4.9 5.2 . A further indication of the relatedness of the gp120 components identified by these two groups of Abs came from sequential immunoprecipitation tests. Pretreatment of ³H glucosamine labeled lysates of SK RC 7 with Ab S₆ removed all antigen reactive with Ab S₂₃. In contrast, M MHA tests and absorption analysis Table 2 showed that these gp120 antibodies identified two serologically distinct gp120 epitopes that distinguish two classes of gp120 molecules gp120r restricted and gp120nr nonrestricted . gp120r, identified by Ab S₂₃, had a highly restricted distribution, expression being limited to normal kidney epithelium and certain renal cancers. The other gp120 epitope, gp120nr, identified by Ab S₆, was found on a wide range of cultured cells including fetal and adult fibroblasts and cell lines derived from ovarian, bladder and colon cancers. gp120r and gp120nr determinants differ in their expression on renal cancer cell lines all cell lines carry the gp120nr epitope,whereas SK RC 2 21, 29, and Caki 1 lack gp120r determinants. The specificity of Ab S₂₃ for cells of renal origin resembles the reactivity of Ab S₂₅ and, most particularly, antibodies identifying the gp160 system. However, in addition to the molecular weight differences in the gp160 and gp120 antigens, these three kidney specific antigenic systems can be distinguished on the basis of absorption analysis with selected normal or malignant kidney cells e. g., SK RC 6 and A 498 are are gp160 S₂₅ gp120r fetal kidney is gp160 or S₂₅ gp120r . V₁ It is not always possible to predict successful hybridoma preparation of one cell line although success may have been achieved with another cell line. Any new cell line is impossible to predict because of the vagaries of the art of monoclonal antibodies. Preparation of hybrid cell lines can be successful or not depending on such experimental factors as nature of the inoculant, cell growth conditions, hybridization conditions and the like. The present invention describes a new monoclonal antibody, F₂₃, a gamma sub 2A γ 2A immunoglobulin Ig . In the previous work mAb S₄ was in that same class of Ig while S₂₅, S₂₂, S₂₃, S₆, S₂₇, V₁ and S₂₁ belonged to immunoglobulin class gamma sub one γ₁ and M₂ and S₈ to Ig class mu u . F₂₃ recognizes a new antigenic system on human renal cells glycoprotein gp 140. F₂₃ is derived from a hybridoma cell line wherein normal human epithelial cells are the immunogen. Yet antibodies to renal tumors are made by this invention. This is an unexpected result. As can be seen from Table I, F₂₃ recognizes human renal cancer cell lines. Of 25 cell lines tested, F₂₃ is positioned for 19 of those. 33 human renal cell lines wer studied. F₂₃ also recognizes some poorly differentiated renal carcinomas and some renal carcinomas with papillary differentiation with its best reaction with well differentiated renal carcinomas i. e. F₂₃ subsets renal carcinomas and can be used to assay for the malignant potential of renal tumors. Frozen renal carcinoma section for over 20 different human specimens were tested as well. Comparison of frozen sections and tissue culture lines established from the same specimens reveals that for most antigens, expression is consistent in vivo and in vitro. See tables I II. Some antigens may be either induced or suppressed in tissue culture. This characteristic must be determined for each antigen prior to extrapolating results between in vivo and in vitro systems. Therefore F₂₃ mAb must be added to the mAb panel for human renal cancer which to date includes then F₂₃, M₁, M₂, S₁, S₄, S₆, S₇, S₈, S₁₁, S₂₁, S₂₂, S₂₃, S₂₄, S₂₅, S₂₆, S₂₇, V₁ and V₂. This entire array of mAbs is used to diagnose renal cancer. A specimen tissue, body waste or fluid or exudate is contacted separately with each of the above mAbs in a screening test for a positive reaction. F₂₃ also gives a positive reaction with two cell lines of normal kidney epithelium. However, F₂₃ did not react with normal human A, B or D erythrocytes by the absorption test. In frozen reactions, F₂₃ reacted with normal kidney and proximal tubule in fetal as well as adult specimens. F₂₃ showed a positive reaction in brain and neurons. Table II. Normal proximal tubule cells express gp antigens at consistent levels gp160, gp120r and gp115 whereas only 5 31 tumors expressed all three antigens. 26 tumors did not express these antigens and 8 of the tumor cell lines tested were negative for gp140. In further differentiating normal versus malignant cells it is noted that when one of the gp antigens 160, 120r or 115 The above examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to limit the scope of the invention. It is obvious that the invention also encompasses all monoclonal antibodies possessing the same characteristics as described herein. The examples do not limit the invention especially with respect to substantially functional equivalents of hybridomas, monoclonal antibodies and cell lines described and claimed herein. Changes in cell antigens are associated with different stages of differentiation and different stages of cancer. Thus this invention technique defined cell antigens associated with differentiation and cancer of the kidney and its associated tubules. In sum then the antibodies discussed subset the nephron and subset renal cancers. Methods used to obtain F₂₃ are as described above in the above section on techniques. The invention involves the use of a micro organism monoclonal antibody , which is deposited at the
