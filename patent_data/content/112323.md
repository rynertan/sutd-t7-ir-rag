# Maleic anhydride production with high butane feed concentration.

## Abstract
An improvement in a process for the production of maleic anhydride by the catalytic vapor phase oxidation of a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon having 4 10 carbon atoms in the presence of a catalyst comprising phosphorus, vanadium and oxygen, wherein long reactor tubes are used in a process employing a high feed concentration and low space velocity so as to minimize air compression.
