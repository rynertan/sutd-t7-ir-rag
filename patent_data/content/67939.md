## Description
SOLDERING APPARATUS FOR PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD The present invention generally relates to a soldering apparatus and more particularly, to a soldering apparatus for soldering chip type elements or components without lead wires such as resistors, capacitors, etc.onto printed circuit boards, with electrode portions provided at opposite ends of the chip type components being soldered onto conductor portions of the printed circuit boards. For the soldering of the chip type components as referred to above, there has conventionally been employed a spouting type soldering system in which molten solder is spouted or applied onto a soldering surface of the printed circuit board during conveyance of the printed circuit board. The known spouting type soldering system as described above is broadly divided into two systems according to configurations of the spouting solder waves, i.e. one system so called as a double direction solder wave spouting type and the other system referred to as a single direction solder wave spouting type as shown in Figs. 1 and 3, respectively. Both of the conventional soldering systems as described above, however, have serious disadvantages inherent therein. More specifically, in the former double direction solder wave spouting type shown inFig. 1, two solder waves 2 and 2 are spouted from a nozzle 1 so as to be symmetrical with respect to the nozzle 1, while a printed circuit board 4, on which chip type components 3 are mounted, is conveyed from left to right as indicated by an arrow in the figure.In the above arrangement, however, when the printed circuit board 4 leaves or exits from the solder wave 2 , the solder wave 2 flows down in the same direction as conveyance of the printed circuit board 4, so that excessive solder adheres to the chip type component 3 and is cooled rapidly, whereby excessive icicle shaped solder fillets 5 projecting out of the chip type component 3 are undesirably formed as shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, in the latter single direction solder wave spouting type proposed to prevent the formation of the excessive icicleshaped solder fillets referred to above as shown in Fig. 3, a solder wave 7 flows down from a nozzle 6 from right to left, that is, in a direction opposite to that of conveyance of the printed circuit board 4, while the circuit board 4 passes through the solder wave 7 along a path inclined upwardly with respect to the direction of conveyance thereof. In the above arrangement, when the circuit board 4 exits from the solder wave 7, the solder wave 7 flows down in the direction opposite to that of conveyance of the circuit board 4, so that excessive solder does not adhere to the chip type component 3 and thus, excessive icicle shaped solder fillets 5 of the double direction wave spouting type are not formed.In the above arrangement, however, since the solder wave 7 is applied to only one side of the chip type component 3, that is, only in a direction from right to left in Fig. 3, a normal solder fillet 9 not exceeding the height of the chip type component 3 is obtained at a forward portion 8 of the chip type component 3 with respect to the direction of conveyance of the circuit board 4 but no solder fillet is formed referred to as dewetting of solder , hereinbelow at a backward portion 10 of the chip type component 3 as shown in Fig. 4 because gas of flux evaporated during the soldering stays at the backward portion 10 without being removed therefrom by the solder wave 7. As is seen from the foregoing description, in both of the conventional spouting type soldering systems, faulty soldering such as excessive icicle shaped solder fillets or dewetting of solder tends to take place, thus undesirably necessitating corrections by manual operations, in which case, there is invited a still more serious problem that the chip type component is liable to be damaged by the local heating applied thereto by a soldering iron to be employed for the repairing, and therefore, it has been strongly required to provide a soldering apparatus for printed circuit boards in which faulty soldering of chip type components is eliminated without necessity for corrections at later stages of the processing. Accordingly, an essential object of the present invention is to provide an improved soldering apparatus for printed circuit boards in which no manual corrections or repairing are required at later stages of the processing through elimination of faulty soldering of chip type components. Another important object of the present invention is to provide an improved soldering apparatus of the above described type which is simple in construction and accurate in functioning at high reliability, and can be readily introduced into a production line at low cost. In accomplishing these and other objects according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an improved soldering apparatus for printed circuit boards comprising a first solder tank and a second solder tank which are provided adjacent to and independently of each other so as to store molten solder therein a first nozzle and a second nozzle which are disposed, respectively, independently of each other in the first solder tank and the second solder tank so as to spout the molten solder in the first solder tank and the second solder tank, respectively and means for conveying the printed circuit board so that the printed circuit board may be passed through the first nozzle and the second nozzle sequentially the second nozzle being disposed higher in height than the first nozzle a level of the molten solder in the second solder tank being disposed higher than that in the first solder tank. In accordance with the present invention, excessive solder fillets formed by the first nozzle are scraped off by the solder wave from the second nozzle and thus, it becomes possible to achieve normal soldering without necessity for modifications or repairing at later stages of the processing. These and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of solder waves in a conventional doubel direction solder wave spouting type soldering system, Fig. 2 is a fragmentary side elevational view showing, on an enlarged scale, the state of faulty soldering in the system of Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of a solder wave in a conventional single direction solder wave spouting type soldering system, Fig. 4 is a fragmentary side elevational view showing, on an enlarged scale, the state of faulty soldering in the system of Fig. 3, Fig. 5 is a cross sectional view of solder waves of a soldering apparatus according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, Fig. 6 is a view similar to Fig. 5, showing a modification thereof, Fig. 7 is a fragmentary side elevational view showing, on an enlarged scale, the state of normal soldering by the soldering apparatus of the present invention, and Fig. 8 is a cross sectional view of solder waves of a soldering apparatus previously developed by the present inventors. Before the description of the present invention proceeds, it is to be noted that like parts are designated by like reference numerals throughout several views of the accompanying drawings. Referring now to the drawings, there are shown in Fig. 5, solder waves of a soldering apparatus according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention. The soldering apparatus generally includes a first nozzle 15 for spouting first molten solder 13 stored in a first solder tank 11 and a second nozzle 16 for spouting second molten solder 14 stored in a second solder tank 12, with the first solder tank 11 and the second solder tank 12 being provided adjacent to and independently of each other. A printed circuit board 4 is passed through the first nozzle 15 and second nozzle 16 sequentially in a direction indicated by an arrow in the figure so as to be inclined upwardly with respect to a direction of conveyance of the printed circuit board 4.Since firstly, the printed circuit board 4 is passed through the first nozzle 15 from which solder waves 17 and 17 are spouted approximately symmetrically with respect to the first nozzle 15, excessive icicleshaped solder fillets 5 shown in Fig. 2 are formed as in the case of the conventional double direction solder wave spouting type soldering system of Fig. 1. Since the printed circuit board 4 is, then, passed through the second nozzle 16 from which a solder wave 18 flows down in a direction opposite to that of conveyance of the printed circuit board 4 in the same manner as the conventional single direction solder wave spouting type soldering system of Fig. 3, excessive portions of the excessive icicle shaped solder fillets 5 are scraped off by the solder wave 18 so that normal solder fillets 19 may be finally formed as shown in Fig. 7.In the above arrangement, since the printed circuit board 4 is conveyed so as to be inclined upwardly with respect to the direction of conveyance of the printed circuit board 4, the second nozzle 16 is disposed higher in height than the first nozzle 15 and a level 21 of the second molten solder 14 stored in the second solder tank 12 is disposed higher than a level 20 of the first molten solder 13 stored in the first solder tank 11 so that a spouting height of the solder waves 17 and 17 from the level 20 and that of the solder wave 18 from the level 21 may be restricted to a minimum and made approximately equal. The minimized spouting height of the solder waves 17, 17 and 18 results in decrease not only in turbulence in flow of the solder waves but also in head of the solder waves, thus minimizing oxidation of the solder waves. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 8, in the case where a level 24 of molten solder stored in a first solder tank 22 is approximately equal to a level 25 of molten solder stored in a second solder tank 23, a spouting height of a solder wave 27 from the level 25 becomes larger than that of solder waves 26 and 26 from the level 24, so that the solder wave 27 flows turbulently at the surface thereof and becomes readily oxidated due to increase in head of the solder wave 27 from the level 25.As a result, the excessive icicle shaped solder fillets 5 by the solder wave 26 and 26 of the first solder tank 22 are not modified completely or a so called solder bridge , i.e., a defect that a shortcircuit is formed between electrodes of adjacent chip type components occurs by the solder wave 27 of the second solder tank 23, so that defective solder fillets 28 are finally formed at the chip type component 3 of the printed circuit board 4 with a consequent economic loss such as increase in oxidation of the solder wave 27. Meanwhile, in the arrangement of the present invention shown in Fig. 5, turbulence in flow of the solder waves 17 and 17 from the first nozzle 15 and the solder wave 18 from the second nozzle 16 is restricted to a minimum so as to decrease oxidation of the solder waves 17, 17 and 18, whereby it becomes possible to achieve normal soldering of chip type components without necessity for modifications or reparing at later stages of the processing. In the above arrangement, although the configuration of the solder waves 17 and 17 from the first nozzle 15 is different from that of the solder wave 18 from the second nozzle 16, the same effect as referred to above can be achieved by an arrangement in which solder waves from the second nozzle 16 have the same configuration as the solder waves 17 and 17 from the first nozzle 15.Namely, as shown in Fig. 6, approximately symmetrical solder waves 32 and 32 are spouted from a first nozzle 31 in a first solder tank 29 so as to flow down to backward and forward portions of the first nozzle 31 with respect to a direction of conveyance of the printed circuit board 4, respectively.Likewise, approximately symmetrical solder waves 34 and 34 are spouted from a second nozzle 33 in a second solder tank 30 so as to flow down to backward and forward portions of the second nozzle 33 with respect to the direction of conveyance of the printed circuit board 4.In the above arrangement of Fig. 6, the second nozzle 33 is disposed higher in height than the first nozzle 31 and a level 35 of molten solder stored in the second solder tank 30 is disposed higher than a level 36 of molten solder in the first solder tank 29 in the same manner as the arrangement of Fig. 5.It is to be noted that the solder waves 32 and 32 from the first nozzle 31 are spouted so high as to dip more than a half of a thickness of the printed circuit board 4 and the solder waves 34 and 34 from the second nozzle 33 are spouted so low as to come into contact with a lower surface of the printed circuit board 4, so that excessive portions of the excessive icicle shaped solder waves 5 formed by the solder waves 32 and 32 from the first nozzle 31 are scraped off by the solder waves 34 and 34 from the second nozzle 33, whereby normal solder fillets 9 are finally formed in the same manner as the arrangement ofFig. 5. Meanwhile, in the arrangements of Figs. 5 and 6, since the first and second solder tanks disposed adjacent to each other are provided with a first pump device and a second pump device, respectively, it is possible to change the spouting heights of the solder waves from the levels of the molten solder in the first solder tank and the second solder tank, respectively with much ease so as to obtain optimum spouting heights of the solder waves corresponding to an inclination angle of conveyance of the printed circuit board 4. As is clear from the foregoing description, in accordance with the present invention, it becomes possible to achieve normal soldering of chip type components onto printed circuit boards without necessity for corrections or repairing at later stages of the processin g, whereby necessity for a great amount of manual work hitherto required for the corrections and consequently, damage of chip type components by the manual repairing operations have been eliminated so as to provide a soldering apparatus of an outstanding industrial value. Although the present invention has been fully described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, unless otherwise such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the present invention, they should be construed as included therein.
