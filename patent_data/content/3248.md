# Composition and method for bleaching hair or keratinous fibre.

## Abstract
A bleaching system which is in powder form and capable on aqueous activation of bleaching hair or keratinous fibre in a simple one stage procedure comprises as active ingredients a source capable on aqueous activation of generating persulphate ions and a percarbonate compound. The composition is particularly applicable for the marking of non human animals which have a coat of hair or keratinous fibre and for this purpose, the composition may be rendered thixotropic by inclusion therein of pyrogenic silica.
