## Description
INSOLUBLE PIGMENTS AND PREPARATION THEREOF This invention concerns pigments and, more particularly, this invention concerns water insoluble pigments which are prepared from water soluble dyes, and processes for making such pigments. Pigments and dyes are known in the art as coloring agents and are useful in various applica tions such as for coloring cosmetics, soaps, food, paints, plastics, and polymers. Dyes are generally liquids or soluble solids which are used in solution. Pigments, conversely, are generally solids and are usually insoluble in the medium in which the pig ment is being used. Pigments are typically pre ferred over dyes in applications where color migra tion, or bleeding, is undesirable. For example, if a dye is used in a toothpaste formulation, the dye may be absorbed by the tongue, teeth and gums of the user. Similarly, in a two tone bar soap, a dye in one color section of the soap may migrate to a different color portion of the soap. Further, the soap dyes may stain the skin of the user as well as sink fixtures. The use of an insoluble pigment in these applications prevents these undesirable occur rences. Although there are a number of known water insoluble pigments, some are considered to be unsuitable because they have been found to be questionable by government regulators on the ground of potential toxicity or carcinogenicity to the user. In addition, some insoluble pigments which are government approved may suffer from a lack of color flexibility. These problems vary according to the use to which the pigments are put. In the case of soaps and cosmetics, for example, skin irritation may result from the incorporation of some known pigments. Another example involves the use of water insoluble pigments in food applications. While at present the United States Food and Drug Admin istration FDA has certified a number of dyes for this use, laboratory animal tests are now disclosing low level carcinogenicity of some of these dyes at high concentrations. Apparently the food dyes are absorbed by the body in the digestive tract. Cur rently available lakes insolubilized food dyes dis solve in the acidic environment of the stomach, releasing the dyes. Therefore, the FDA. is consider ing decertification of the offending dyes and pig ments made therefrom. As no replacements exist at present, the food processing industry may face major adjustments in its coloration expectations in the near future. Related to food applications is the issue of the coloration of plastics that will be used in contact with food. Pending FDA regulation will require cer tification of any colorant used in contact with food, but current plastics colorants are for the most part unlikely to qualify for such certification, and dyes and pigments currently approved for food contact do not generally exhibit the chemical and thermal stability necessary for plastics processing. A final problem encountered in the pigment and dye area is related to commercial desirability. In producing pigments from dyes, a loss of color brightness and intensity, along with hue changes, is encountered. While use of increased amounts of pigments will help to counteract these effects, the expensive cost of the dye precursor represents significant increase in costs associated with pig ment production and, ultimatley, of the soap, cos metic, food, plastic or other polymer in which the colorant will be utilized. Thus, it would be highly desirable to provide a nontoxic, noncarcinogenic, water insoluble pigment which is suitable for use in body contact, ingestion and plastics processing applications and which has a relatively greater color flexibility. It would also be desirable to provide a process for preparing such a nontoxic, noncarcinogenie, chemically and thermal ly stable water insoluble pigment. In one aspect, the invention is a water insoluble pigment which comprises a complex of 1 a water insoluble, inorganic substrate exhibiting anion ex change properties, 2 a water soluble dye, and 3 an anionic amphipathic material. In another aspect, the invention is a process for preparing a water insoluble pigment which com prises contacting 1 a water insoluble, inorganic substrate exhibiting anion exchange properties, 2 a water soluble dye and 3 an anionic amphipathic material. In yet another aspect, the jnvention is the pigment produced by the aforementioned process. As used herein the term pigment is meant to include any substance, usually in finely divided i.e., powder form, that is highly colored and im parts color to another substance or mixture as a result of dispersion therein. The pigment is insolu ble in an aqueous medium under normal conditions of use. Preparation of pigments, according to the present invention, requires, as a first component a substrate exhibiting anion exchange properties, as a second component a water soluble dye, and as a third component an anionic amhipathic material. The substrate exhibiting anion exchange properties used in the present invention is essentially any inorganic anion exchange material exhib iting anion exchange properties, i.e., anion ex change capacity, under normal conditions of use.The term substrate will be used herein inter changeably with the terms anion exchange ma terial and anion exchanger. Various anion exchange materials are useful in the present invention including, for example, a metal oxide, a hydrous metal oxide, a metal hydroxide, a mixture of two or more metal oxides, a mixture of two or more hydrous metal oxides and a mixture of two or more metal hydroxides.

The hydroxides are coprecipitated with a base such as an alkali metal base or ammonia at a pH range from 8 to 13, preferably from 9 to 11. Bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or ammonium hydroxide may be used M in the above general formula is preferably magnesium and Q is preferably aluminium. Another substrate useful in the present invention is a layered mixed metal hydroxide having anion exchange capacity which may be described by the following general formula lI Mx 20y 3 OH 2x 3y.z A d A 2 e A 3 f A 4 g .n H2O where M is a metal element or elements each with a positive valence of 2 Q is a metal element or elements each with a positive valence of 3 A l, A 2, A 3, and A 4 are each one or more exchangeable anions each having a negative valence of 1 2, 3, and 4, respectively and n, x, y, z, d, e, f, and g are real numbers greater than our equal to zero and satisfy the following O zs Y 1.5 x y S 6 d 2e 3f 49 z In the above equation the metal element or elements M may be, for example , divalent metals such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, iron, cobalt, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc, or mixtures thereof and the metal element or elements Q may be trivalent metals such as aluminium, iron, chronium, gallium, cobalt, rhenium, indium or mixtures thereof.

Other anion exchangers and their preparation which may be used are described in Japanese Patent 198198265. Yet another example of an anion exchange material useful in the present invention of the type having a layered crystalline structuref may be represented by the following general formula 111 M Q 2 Al OH 3 A ld A 2 e A 3 A4 genH2O where M is a metal element or elements each with a positive valence of 1 Q is a metal element or elements each with a positive valence of 2 A 1,A 2, A 2, and A 4 are each one or more exchangeable anions each having a negative valence of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively and n, x, y, d, e, f, and g are real numbers greater than or equal to zero and satisfy the following 0 x 2y I 1 d 2e 3f 4g x 2y Owns10 The above anion exchange materials include the magnesium aluminate anion exchangers described in U. S. Patent 4,326,961 albeit, the formula is written in a different manner and these exchangers may be prepared in accordance with the process described in U. S. Patent 4,326,961. Other layered anion exchange materials and their preparation, within scope of the above formula, may include, for example, me crystalline lithium aluminates described in U S. Patents 4,348,295 and 4,348,297. Still another anion exchange material used in the present invention and its method of preparation is described in U. S. Patent 3,002,932 and in an article by E. J. Duwell and J. W. Shepard, entitled The Preparation and Properties of Some SyntheticInorganic Anion Exchangers , Journal of Phvsical Chemistrv, Vol. 63 1959 , pp. 2044 2047. U. S. Patent 3,002,932 describes amorphous or noncrystalline anion exchangers consisting essentially of mixed insoluble hydrated oxides of a pair of metals selected from the group consisting of aluminium, silicon, titanium, zinc and zirconium. The above exchangers may be prepared by coprecipitating mixed hydrated oxide of a pair of the metals above with the lower valent number of said pair being present in a major molar amount and the higher valent member of said pair being present in a minor molar amount, in an aqueous medium at a pH in the range of 5 to 7. t to 25 mole percent of a selected suitable water soluble derivative of the higher valent member of the combination is dissolved in water together with 99 to 75 mole percent of a selected suitable water soluble derivative of the lower valent member of the combination to give a solution containing from 5 to 20 weight percent of solute, and which is acidic, having a pH value before 5. The resulting solution is brought up to a pH value below 5.The resulting solution is brought up to a pH of 5 to 7 by the gradual addition of a base such as sodium hydroxide, at a temperature of 20 C to 90 C. A precipitate of mixed hydrated oxide or hydroxide forms and then the aqueous slurry is dried at a temperature below 155 C. Thereafter, the dried mixture is washed with water to remove soluble impurities therefrom. Another anion exchange material used in the present invention and its methof of preparation is described in Attorney s Dockets 31,630 and 34,222A filed on even dater herewith and entitled Inorganic Anion Exchangers and Preparation Thereof. The preferred anion exchange materials used in the present invention and their method of preparation are those described in the above pat ent applications. The substrate consists of a com bination of metal hydroxides, hydrated metal ox ides, and metal oxides of a pair of metal cations or elements. A first metal element of the pair of metal elements has a lower positive valence than that of a second metal element. The first lower valent member has a positive valence lower by one in teger than that of the second higher valent member of the pair.For example, if the first metal element has a positive valence of 2, the second metal element has a positive valence of 3 if the first metal element has a positive valence of 3, then the second metal element has a positive valence of 4 and so on. Metal elements with a 2 valence may be elements such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, iron, cobalt, manganese, nickel, cop per, zinc or mixtures thereof metal elements with a valence of 3 may be elements such as al uminiumn, iron, chromium, gallium, cobalt, rhenium, indium or mixtures thereof metal ele ments having a 4 valence may be titanium, ger medium, tin, lead, zirconium hafnium, vanadium or mixtures thereof metal elements having 5 va lence may be elements such as antimony, vana dium, niobium, tantalum or mixtures thereof and metal elements having a 6 valence may be ele ments such as chromium, molydenum, tungsten or mixtures thereof. The metal oxides, hydrous metal oxides and metal hydroxides of the present invention may be described by the general formula lav Ma1 .xQ xa 1Oy c l0 OH I A l d A 2 A 3 f A t .nH O where M is a metal elerrient or elements each with a positive valence of a Q is a metal element or elements each with a positive valence of a 1 a is 2, 3, 4 or 5 A , A 2, A 2, and A 4 are each one or more exchangeable anions each having a negative valence of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively x is O x b 0.5 and n, y, z, d, e, f.and g are real numbers greater than or equal to zero and satisfy the following 2y z a O d 2e 3f 49 5 x 0 n 10 Preferably, the elements M and Q are aluminum, titanium, or magnesium. More preferably, mixed metal hydroxides, hydrated metal oxides, and metal oxides of aluminum and titanium and mixed metal hydroxides, hydrated metal oxides and metal oxides of magnesium and aluminum are used as the anion exchange material herein described. A preferred anion exchange material of the present invention which comprises a combination of aluminum and titanium metal elements may be represented by the following general formula V Al1 .xTixOy OH z A l d A 3 e A 3 f A 4 gn H20 where A l, A 2, A 3, and A 4 are each one or more exchangeable anions each having a negative valence of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively x is 0 x S 0.5 and n, y, z, d, e, f, and g are real numbers greater than or equal to zero and satisfy the following 2y z 3 0 d 2e 3f 4g x û S n S 1 0 Another preferred anion exchange material of the present invention which comprises a combination of magnesium and aluminum metal elements may be represented by the general formula Vl Mg1 .XAI xOy OH z A 1 d A 2 e A 3 f A 4 g nH2O where A l, A 2, A 3, and A 4 are each one or more exhangeable anions each having a negative valence of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively x is 0 x S 0.5 and n, y, z, d, e, f, and g are real numbers greater than or equal to zero and satisfy the following 2y z 2 0 d 2e 3f 49 5 x 0 S n S 1 0 The exhangeable anions of any of the aforementioned compositions may be any inorganic or organic exchangeable anions commonly known in the art of anion exchangers. The exchangeable anions may be monovalent, bivalent, trivalent, tetravalent anions or mixtures of two or more of these exchangeable anions. In the above formulas, the anion A 1, for example, may be an inorganic anion selected from halides such as fluorides F chlorides Cl 1 bromides Br 1 and iodides I 1 carbonates such as HCO3 1 nitrates NO3 1 sulfates such as HSO 1 phosphates such as H2PO4 1 permanganates such as MnO4 1 hydroxides such as OH 1 and mixtures thereof.For example, the anion A 1, may be a combination of two or more exchangeable anions described above, such as a mixture of Cl 1 and HCO3 1 anions. In the above formulas, the anion A 2, for example, may be an inorganic anion selected from carbonates such as CO3 2 sulfates such as SO4 2 phosphates such as HPO4 2 and mixtures thereof. For example, the anion A 2 may be a combination of two or more exchangeable anions described above such as a mixture of SOJ2 and CO3 2.In the above formulas, the anion A 3, for example, may be phosphates such as PO4 3. The anions A 4, used in the above formulas, may be for example organic anions such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA and diphosphates such asEMI4.1 Other organic exchangeable anions used in the above formulas may include, for example, stearates, formates, acetates, benzoates and mixtures thereof. In addition to the above anions used in the present invention, the compositions above may have a combination of two or more exchangeable anions selected from the group of A 1, A 2, A 3, and A as described above. For example, the compositions may include a mixture of anions such as Cl 1 and CO3 2 anions or Cl and SO 42 anions. The total negative charge of the exchangeable anion or mixture of exchangeable anions selected for the above compositions should be sufficient to balance the excess positive charge of the metal oxides, hydrates oxides and hydroxides of the above compositions. A suitable exchangeable anion used in any of the final compositions described above is in the sulfate anion SO 2 . The second component of the present invention is a water soluble dye. The term dye , as used herein, is meant to include material that will bind, by an anion exchange mechanism, to the material to which it is applied and which will impart the appearance of a solid color to a formulation with which it is mixed Water soluble dye means that the dye is at least slightly soluble i.e., at least about 0.01 weight percent soluble in either pure neutral water, an aqueous salt solution, or an aqueous alkaline or acidic solution in which the dye remains chemically stable. Any dye and mixtures of two or more dyes which will be complex with the anion exhange material used herein may be used. Preferably, the dyes used are those which are designated by theUnited States Food and Dug Administration FDA as Food, Drug and Cosmetics FD colors, Drug and Cosmetic D colors and mixtures thereof.For example FD Blue No. 7, Blue No. 2, GreenNo. 3, Red No. 3, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, and mixtures thereof, are preferred dyes. Examples of preferred D dyes include Green No. 8, YellowNo. 7, Yellow No. 10 and mixtures thereof. These dyes, and their structures and properties are well known to those skilled in the art. Further information may be obtained for instance, in Kirk OthmerEncyclopedia of Chemical Techn6logy , 3rd Edition, Volume 6, pages 561 596. The third component of the present invention is an anionic amphipathic material. An amphipathic molecule is defined in Organic Chemistry, by Morrison and Boyd, 3rd Edition, N. Y. 1973, at page 1060. An amphipathic molecule contains both a hydrophilic water loving end and a hydrophobic water fearing end. In the present invention, it is preferred to use an anionic amphipathic material, i.e. the amphipathic material should have a functional group with a negative charge, i.e., CO2 l or S03 at its hydrophilic end which can be used to exchange with the anion of the substrate and thus attach to the substrate. The substrate is rendered hydrophobic by attaching a sufficient amount of anionic amphipathic material to the substrate.It is believed that the anionic amphipathic material provides a coating of hydrophobicity to the final pigment particle. By coating of hydrophobicity it is meant that the pigment particle as a whole will be antagonistic to water, ie., hydrophobic. Preferably, the anionic amphipathic material used is slightly soluble in water. Examples of anionic amphipathic material used in the present invention consists of a long chain organic functionality which will exhibit hydrophobicity under normal conditions of use and contains a functional group with a negative charge as described above.The anionic amphipathic material may include, for example, stearic acid and an alkali metal salt thereof such as sodium stearates, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and salts thereof with a carbon chain length of at least about eight and above, for example, caprate tCH3tCH2 COOH , sodium caprate CH3 CH2 9COO Na , sodium oleate, and sodium laurate sulfonated organic compounds with carbon chain lengths of at least about eight and above such as sodium lauryl sulfate and anionic soap molecules such as sodium cocoate, sodium tallowate and mixtures thereof. Because the anion amphipathic material above provides the pigments of the present invention with hydrophobicity, the hydrophobic pigments are particularly useful in providing a uniform dispersion in a nonaqueous, nonpolar material such as organic polymers, plastics and nonaqueous solvents, and the pigments advantageously prevent interaction of aqueous phase materials with the pigment. The hydrophobicity of the pigment is an important fea ture and is useful in applications, for example, when there is an agent in an aqueous phase such as other inorganic anions, soaps, detergents, surfactants or fatty acids and salts thereof which would ordinariiy react with the pigment to cause color loss by anion exchange or other mechanisms.In these applications, the hydrophobic character of the pigment causes the pigment surface to repel the aqueous phase, thus minimizing the undesirable reaction. For example it has been determined that the hydrophilic end of the soap molecule will attack pigments known in the art, which have been made by insolublizing a dye, to cause color loss. It has now been shown that when a pigment is pretreated with an anionic amphipathic material such as sodium stearate a long chain fatty acid , the anion exchange reaction attaches a sufficient amount of long chain organic groups to the pigment particles such that the whole particle surface becomes hydrophobic. Thus, the hydrophobic end of the soap molecule associates with the hydrophobic surface of the pigment which results in minimizing color loss. In canyiong out the process according to the present invention, the anion exchange material, the water soluble dye and anionic amphipathic material are contacted together under conditions in which a water insoluble pigment is obtained. Water insoluble pigment means that the pigment is not appreciably soluble i.e., less than about 0.01 weight percent soluble in either pure neutral water, an aqueous salt solution, or an aqueous alkaline or acidic solution in which the pigment remains chemically stable. Desirably, the anion exchange material and water soluble dye are first contacted together in a liquid medium in which the dye has been dissolved. The dye may be dissolved in water and the anion exchange material added to the water.Another process for contacting the dye and anion exchange material involves passing the dye dissolve in water througha bed of anion exchange material in an ion exchange column. Other processes which provide sufficient intimate contact between the materials may be used. Once the dye and anion exchange material are contacted together, an insoluble complex forms immediately, i.e., in less than about 10 seconds. After the dye and anion exchange material are contacted together, the anionic amphipathic material is contacted with the dye and anion exchange complex to form the pigment of the present invention. The same methods described above used for contacting the dye and anion exchange material may be used for contacting the anionic amphipathic material with the dye and anion exchange complex. The anionic amphipathic material is added so as to induce an ion exchange reaction in the medium in which the agent is soluble. The amount of the dye and anionic amphipathic material attached to the anion exchange material substrate corresponds to the total exchange capacity of the substrate used. For example, the substrate may have an anion exchange capacity of 0.5 meq g to 3.0 meq g, and preferably from 1.0 meq g to 2.0 meq g. Generally, the amount of dye on the substrate is preferably froom 1 percent to 40 percent by weight. The anionic amphipathic material may be from 1 percent to 30 percent and preferably from 5 percent to 20 percent by weight. Another process for preparing the pigment of the present invention is to precipitate the anion exchange material in the presence of the dye, the anionic amphipathic material and other desired additives such as the CO3 2 or SO4 2 divalent salts.The process may be carried out in a batch or continuous operation. Preferably, an aqueous solution of the dye, anionic amphipathic material and the other desired components is formed. Then an aqueous solution of the water soluble salts of M and Q, such as previously described, is formed.Thereafter, a base such as sodium hydroxidr or ammonia, the salt solution and the solution of the dye, anionic amphipathic material and other components are substantially simultane ously contacted together to form a precipitate. The precipitate is the pigment material according to the present invention. The metal salts of M and Q may be dissolved in water separately or together and thereafter contacted with the above solutions as described above. Sufficient base should be used to maintain the desired pH constant and to precipitate the anion exchange substrate. The various pigment materials produced by the above methods may be used, alone, or in combination with each other to form different color pigment materials. For example, a yellow pigment may be blended with blue pigment to form a green pigment. The size of the pigment particles obtained can vary widely. Typically, for some applications, such as coloring agents for soaps, the particle size is preferably from 200 angstroms to 20 microns in diameter. The size of the precipitated particle obtained according to the present invention is preferably in the range of from 200 angstroms to 20 microns. The size of the particles can be controlled by controlling variables such as reagent selection, temperature, pH, concentration, and stirring speed during the precipitation steps. It is also to be understood that larger size particles than 20 microns can be ground to the desired size. The pigments may be added to toiletries such as soaps e.g., soap bars , toothpastes and cosmetics in amounts such that the desired color is obtained using techniques known in the art. The pigments of this invention can also be added to other items such as paints, plastics, polymers, fabric or food which are desirable to be colored. When the pigments are to be used in plastics, one method of incorporation would be to use the pigment desired in either a dry powder form or as a paste or slurry in a suitable soivent. The particular solvent will depend on the plastic used. The pigment is then added or mixed with the pellets or granules of either a thermoplastic or thermoset resin at the time of processing. Because of the significant thermal stability of pigments formed from insolubilized dyes by the formulation of the present invention, a number of processing methods may be employed.These include molding by methods such as injection molding compression molding vacuum forming blow molding structural foam, including conventional low pressure, high pressure and expanding mold using either chemical or physical blowing agents extrusion, including profile, pipe, wire and cable, sheet and coextrusion coinjection molding and thermoforming. The incorporation of the insoluble pigments is accomplished by whatever method would be used to incorporate a dye colorant into the selected high polymer, e.g., melt blending. These pigments, in being incorporated into the plastic material, are chemically and thermally stable. The insolubility of the dye is maintined throughout processing and in the final polymer material, so that the dye cannot be adsorbed onto any food with which it comes into contact. This feature will satisfy and FDA regulations and avoid any problems of suspected or actual carcinogenicity associated with dye ingestion. Typical applications will contain a level of pigment within the range of from 0.001 to 0.1 percent by weight however, the pigment level will vary substantially according to the tint strength of the particular pigment, the resin selected and a number of other variables. When dyes are to be intentionally used as food colorants, prior insolubilization through the process of the present invention to produce pigments also provides some protection against physiological dangers that may be associated with the dye precursors themselves. It has been found that some of these pigments are stable in very acid pH environments, such as the stomach. The pigments processing this stability, at low pH levels in particular, are primarily those in which M, in any of the substrate formulas above, is aluminum and Q is titanium. Because a water soluble dye complexed with a water insoluble. inorganic substrate of this formula and an organic amphipathic material remains insoluble throughout the digestive process, it cannot be absorbed into any bodily tissues in which it may cause harm.Typical levels of these pigments in food are small and usually vary from 0.0001 percent to 0.1 percent by weight. The pigment produced by the present invention may be used in any of its applications either alone or in combination with other additives which are not detrimental to the pigment properties. Other materials or components which may be mixed with the pigment may include, for example, fillers such as clays, and extenders such as TO2, At203, and Al OH 3 which will not substantially adversely affect the pigment properties. Other additives may be used, for example, to pelletize, agglomerate or coat the pigment, provided the pigment properties are not substantially adversely affected. The various additives used with the pigment will depend on the application in which the pigment is used. In addition to using other materials as additives along with the pigments of the present invention in a designated application, certain materials may be complexed with the pigment components to increase the efficacy of the colorant One problem encountered with pigments made from insolubilized dyes is a loss of color brightness and intensity and also color hue changes occurring during the in solubilization process. These problems increase as the amount of dye insolubilized increases in proportion to the substrate. An effective way of count erecting this problem is through the complexing of a water soluble polymer with the basic pigment complex. Modified suspending agents such as cellulosic materials work particularly well.These include carboxymethyl methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, and other water soluble polymers with an anionic functionality. The polymer serves to stabilize the color hue and maintain the original.brightness and intensity of the dye precursor. An added advantage is that the polymer is insolubilized along with the other pigment components and thus does not effect the inert nature of the pigment particularly desired for many applications, such as in food, cosmetics, and food contact plastics. The celluloses are of themselves generally physiologically inert. It is preferable when adding a water soluble polymer to use up to 3 percent by weight of the polymer and up to 10 percent by weight of the dye, the remainder being the inorganic anion exchange material and anionic amphipathic material.The reduced amount of dye needed, therefore, to produce a pigment capable of imparting a given brightness level and hue stability represents a substantial cost savings in many applications. and the addition of the polymer does not effect other prop erties of the pigment, such as its chemical and thermal stability and physiological inertness. The general preferred process for adding the water soluble polymer comprises steps including dissolving the components of the selected inorganic anion exchange material in water dissolving the water soluble polymer in water combining the two solutions with a source of alkalinity to precipitate the anion exchange material in the presence of the water soluble polymer and adding a selected water soluble dye to the suspended precipitate. The pigment product may then be washed with suitable pH distilled water to remove excess reactants and by products. Alternativeiy, the pigment can be completely synthesized first, then the water soluble polymer added to it in aqueous solution.
