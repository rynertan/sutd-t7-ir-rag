# A method and apparatus for sewing mitered corners on a split needle bar sewing machine.

## Abstract
A semi automatic split needle bar sewing machine 10 in cludes a sewing machine 12 which is driven by a motor 26 that drives a left needle 22 and a right neddle 23 . A presser foot 24 is operated by presser lift actuator 30 . The needles 22 and 23 can activate in unison or independently by use of fall out actuators 41 and 43 , respectively. A control chassis 50 includes a microprocessor controller 51 that is pro grammable through an input panel 44 . An edge detector 40 detects the edge of the material to provide feedback for the microprocessor controller 51 . The microprocessor controller 51 is operable to sew a decorative pattern with mitered cor ners by sensing the pivot point of the mitered corner and auto matically disangaging one of the needles 22 or 23 . The microprocessor controller 51 then continues single needle sewing around the apex of the mitered corner by counting a predetermined number of stitches and varying the length of the stitches such that the needle is in the correct position when the single needle sewing again arrives at the pivot point on the other side of the mitered corner. In this manner, it is not ne cessary for the operator to manually adjust the length of the stitches around the apex of the mitered corner.
