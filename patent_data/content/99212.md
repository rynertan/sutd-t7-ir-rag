# An improved filter assembly.

## Abstract
A plurality of individual filters 1 extend in line across a duct 2 for a gas flow and the duct can be located within secondary containment 7 . The pressure of gas within the duct is less than external pressure and the filters 1 can be supported by a guideway 9 which extends across the duct between opposing walls of the secondary containment 7 with the interior of the guideway communicating with the secondary containment to provide an inward flow purge. The filters in the line are replaced individually by inserting a replacement filter into the line at one end and retrieving the displaced filter at the opposite end of the line.
