# Apparatus for the inspection of translucent containers.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a conveyor 10 for transporting a container 12 through an inspection zone, and means 15, M1, M2, M3 for directing a plurality of light beams B1, B2, B3 sideways at the container during its movement through the zone. Each light beam is directed at the side of the container from a different direction relative to the container, and deflec tion means cause each of the beams to repeatedly scan the side of the container in a vertical direction as the container moves fully through each beam. A respective opto electronic light collector L1, L2, L3 is provided for each beam for provid ing a respective signal S representing the amount of light falling thereon from the respective beam after transmission through the container, and signal processing circuitry 40 is associated with each light collector to examine the signal therefrom according to a predetermined criterion to generate fault indicating signal 41 when such criterion is fulfilled. Means are provided for allocating to each beam a respective area of the container sidewall for which any such fault indicating signal can be regarded as resulting from an actual fault rather than from a characteristic of an acceptable con tainer, and any fault indicating signal generated when the respective beam is not scanning the allocated area of the container sidewall is suppressed. In one embodiment the scanned area of the sidewall of the container allocated to each beam is a rectangle defined by the duration of a gating signal and the scan height of the beams. In a second embodiment, however, the allocated area of each beam is defined by a random access memory 42 having stored therein binary information identifying those regions of an acceptable container from which fault indicating signals may be generated according to the said criterion even in the absence of a fault.
