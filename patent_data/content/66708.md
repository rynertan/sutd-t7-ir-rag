# METHOD FOR EFFECTING A SURFACE EXAMINATION OF COATED COMPONENTS

## Abstract
A method of effecting an examination by eddy current means 24 of the surface of a coated component 58 for cracks having at least a preset minimal dimension. The subject method can be used to detect such cracks in the surface of metal components 58 that are coated or covered with a nonmetallic material. Further, through the use of the subject method such cracks are detectable without necessitating the removal of the nonmetallic coating or covering from the surface of the metal component 58 . The subject method encompasses the steps of establishing calibration readings for cracks of the desired dimension utilizing the eddy current means 24 with which the desired surface examination of the given component 58 is to be effected, performing a preexamination validation of the operativeness of the eddy current means 24 , and conducting with the eddy current means 24 the surface examination of the given metal component 58 that is coated or covered with a nonmetallic material.
