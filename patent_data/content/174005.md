# Line equalizer operable in response to an input signal of a variable data rate.

## Abstract
In a line equalizer responsive to an input signal of a variable data rate for producing an equalizer output signal, a control circuit 12 supplies an equalizer circuit 11 with a selection signal SEL which is determined by the data rate and an output level of the equalizer output signal to select one of frequency gain characteristics that is matched with a line loss characteristic of a line. The equalizer circuit is implemented by a switched capacitor circuit and samples the input signal by a clock signal CK a clock frequency of which is varied by a clock signal controller 51 in consideration of the data rate. An additional equalizer circuit may be con nected in cascade to the equalizer circuit and controlled by an additional control signal determined by the data rate and the output level. In this event, the selection signal may be determined only by the output level with the clock signal left out of consideration.
