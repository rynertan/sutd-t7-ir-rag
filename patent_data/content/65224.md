# Lighting apparatus.

## Abstract
Lighting apparatus for independently controlling the lighting level in several areas or zones. For example, each zone zone A D has two fluorescent lamp units, one L1 connected between the power lines through the contacts of a first low voltage AC latching relay LR1 , and the other L2 which produces about half the light of the first connected between the power lines through the contacts of a second relay LR2 . Each relay has three terminals 21, 22 and 23 . When a low voltage AC signal is applied between a first terminal 21 and a common terminal 23 , the relay is latched closed and when a low voltage AC signal is applied between a second terminal 22 and a common terminal 23 the relay is latched open. The common terminals 23 of the two relays of each zone are connected together to provide enable connections ZA, ZB, ZC and ZD identify ing each zone. The first terminals 21 of all the first relays LR1 are connected together, the first terminals of all the second relays LR2 are connected together, the second terminals 22 of all the first relays LR1 are connected together and the second terminals of all the second relays LR2 are connected together to provide four data connections L1 ON, L2 ON, L1 OFF, and L2 OFF . By applying momentary low voltage AC signals between appropriate data L1 ON, L2 ON, L1 OFF, and L2 OFF and enable ZA, ZBd, ZC and ZD connections, any desired combination of lamps con be turned on or off.
