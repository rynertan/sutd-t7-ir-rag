# Method for manufacturing a reinforced polymer product.

## Abstract
A mixture of a basic thermoplastic and of a more orientatable and crystallizable reinforcing polymer is ex truded through a nozzle of an extruder or of an injection molding machine, and these molten elements have a temperature in the nozzle of about the melting temperature of the polymer, to at most 10 C thereabove. The reinforced polymer product presents excellent strength properties.
