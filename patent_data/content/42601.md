# Non destructive inspection by frequency spectrum resolution.

## Abstract
A method of inspecting non destructively a specimen for examining presence or absence of a defect in the specimen, in which an ultrasonic wave is emitted from a probe 2 and a reflected wave from the specimen 1 is received by the probe 2 whose output signal is processed to determine the presence or absence of the defect. The signal processing includes steps of extracting characteristic parameters from a frequency spectrum of the ultrasonic echo and comparing the extracted parameter with corresponding experimentally or theoretically determined value. The invention makes it possible to automatically determine discriminatively whether the reflector of the ultrasonic echo is a configured portion, a weld boundary or a defect of a specimen to be inspected.
