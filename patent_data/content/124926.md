# Device for the line wise compression of binary data of a picture field scanning device for a document suitable for such compression.

## Abstract
In a system for the line wise compression of binary data of a picture field, a first series of data bits of a current picture line and a second series of data bits of the directly preceding picture line are shifted together into a compression translator 74 . To this end, in a memory operation each time a word of a line memory is read in order to obtain the data of the preced ing line at the same time the same word is written in order to buffer the data of the current line. At the output of the com pression translator the serial compression bits are regrouped in order to form words. Exclusively groups of significant com pression bits are thus formed. For the decompression a code word is read and a series of data bits is emulated and encoded. When the code word thus found corresponds to the code word read, a next code word is read and possibly a change of value for the data bits to be subsequently emulated is intro duced.
