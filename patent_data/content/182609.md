Esters and non pharmaceutically useful salts of the compounds of the formula I are useful intermediates in the preparation and purification of compounds of the formula I and pharmaceutically useful salts thereof, and are therefore within the scope of the present invention.Thus, salts of the compounds of the formula I useful in the present invention include but are not limited to those derived from inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric and phosphoric acids, and organic acids such as isethionic 2 hydroxyethylsul onic , maleic, malonic, succinic, salicylic, tartaric, lactic, citric, formic, lactobionic, pantothenic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, toluenesul onic, naphthalene 2 sulfonic, and ascorbic acids, and amino acids such as glycine. Pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts are preferred, particu larly those that are soluble in solvents suitable çor parenteral administration, for example, hydrochlorides, methanesulfonates and isethionates.Esters of compounds of formula I are derived from acids known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for ester formation, and are conveniently those derived from C16 alkanoic acids or alkanoic acid derivatives, for example acetic acid, propionic acid, n butyric acid and iso butyric acid. The esters may be formed from all or only some of the hydroxy groups contained in the compounds o formula I .The compounds of formula I and their ethers, esters, and salts thereof may be prepared by any method known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure. Thus, the compounds of formula I may, for example, be prepared by any of the methods defined below.1. The reduction of a compound RCH NR1 wherein R and R1 are as hereinbefore defined, or an appropriately protected derivative thereon followed by deprotection where appropriate.The conditions and reagents for such a reaction are well known to those skilled in the art, and any such conditions reagents may be employed. The conversion o II or suitably protected derivatives thereof may be carried out by a reducing agent followed by deprotection if necessary. The reduction is conveniently carried out by a metal hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride, sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, or by catalytic hydrogenation, conveniently by hydrogen in the presence Or a metal catalyst such as palladium or platinum, or equivalent reagents as outlined by J. March, Advanced OrganicChemistry, 2nd ed., pages 819 820, McGraw Hill, New York, 1977.The reduction is suitably carried out with the compound of formula II in solution in an inert solvent or mixture o solvents compatible with the reducing agent, at a nonextreme temperature, for example, between Oo and 8O0C, conveniently at room temperature.In the case of lithium aluminum hydride and like reagents, suitable solvents include ethers for example tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether and 1,2 dimethoxyethane optionally in the presence of a hydrocarbon cosolvent for example toluene, benzene or hexane .In the case of sodium borohydride and like reagents, suitable solvents include alcohols for example ethanol, methanol or isopropanol optionally in the presence of a hydrocarbon cosolvent for example toluene, benzene or hexane or an ether cosolvent for example diethylether or tetrahydrofuran In the case of sodium cyanoborohydride and like reagents, suitable solvents Include those described for sodium borohydride and the reduction is conveniently carried out in the presence of an acid, conveniently glacial acetic acid or ethanolic hydrochloric acid as outlined in, for example, R. Hutchins et al.,Organic Preparations and Procedures International 11, 201 1979 . In the case of catalytic hydrogenation, suitable solvents include alcohols or example methanol and ethanol optionally in the presence of a hydrocarbon cosolvent for example toluene or benzene , or ether cosolvent for example diethyl ether or tetrahydro uran optionally in the presence of an acid for example glacial acetic acid or ethanolic hydrochloric acid , or glacial acetic acid.Protected derivatives o compounds RCH NR1 are conveniently used when lithium aluminum hydride is employed as the reducing agent. Convenient protecting groups are compatible with the reducing agent utilized and are readily removed under nondestructive conditions, for example benzyl, tetrahydropyranyl and isopropylidene ethers.It is often convenient not to isolate the compound RCH NR1 but to react a compound RCHO with a compound NH2R1 wherein R and R1 are as defined in I and to reduce the compound of the formula RCH NR1 so formed in situ. The reaction of the compounds RCHO and NH2R1 is again suitably carried out using conditions and reagents which are well known to those skilled in the art, for example in the presence of an acid, such as a sulfonic acid, i.e. toluenesulfonic acid, in an appropriate inert solvent, such as an aromatic hydrocarbon, suitably toluene, with azeotropic removal 09 water followed by treatment with the reducing agent in an appropriate solvent, suitably ethanol or methanol. Alternatively, RCH NR1 wormed under equilibrium conditions in appropriate solvents can be reduced in situ with an appropriate reducing agent, suitably sodium cyanoborohydride.The compound RCHO may be in the form of a protected aldehyde, Por example an acetal, which liberates the aldehyde function under the reaction conditions.In turn, a compound ROHO can be synthesized by reacting the appropriate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a ormylating agent such as that generated by the reaction between SnCl4 and Cl2CHOCH3 or equivalent reagents, for example, according to the method of A. Reiche et al., Chem. Ber. 93, 88 1960 , or with other standard formylating reagents procedures known to the art, for example, the Gatterman Koch reaction CO HC1 AIC13 CUC1 , the Gatterman reaction HCN HCl ZnC12 , and the Vilsmeier reaction POCl3 PhN Me3CHO orPOCl3 Me2NCHO J. March, vide supra pages 494497 . The compounds RCHO may also be prepared from an appropriate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon substituted by a suitable functional group such as CH2OH,CHBr2, CH3, COCH3, COOH, or CN, and converting this functional group to an aldehyde group by methods well known to those skilled in the art.Where the polycyclic aromatic ring bears substituents, RCHO may be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art of organic chemistry depending on the nature of the substituent on the ring. For example, if the substituent s is a halogen, the starting materials may be prepared by direct treatment of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a halogenating agent e.g. Cl2, Br2, or SO2Cl2 or indirectly by such routes as the Sandmeyer reaction H.H. Hodgson, Chem. Rev. 40, 251 1947 . I the substituent s is alkyl, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon may be reacted with the appropriate reagents under Friedel Crafts reaction conditions G.A. Olah, Friedel Crafts and RelatedReactions, Vols. 1 3, Interscience, New York, NY, 1963 1965 .The compounds of the formula NH2R1 and ethers thereof also may be prepared by methods known in the art, for example, when R1 is as hereinbefore defined, by the reaction of NO2R18, wherein R18 isEMI11.1 wherein R6 to R8 and m are as hereinbefore defined, with an appropriate aldehyde, conveniently acetaldehyde or formaldehyde as in B.M. Vanderbilt andH.B. Hass, Ind. Eng. Chem. 32, 34 1940 followed by reduction as outlined in J.March, vide supra, pages 1125 1126 , conveniently by hydrogen and a metal catalyst for example, a platinum containing catalyst in an appropriate solvent, conveniently glacial acetic acid. 2. The reduction o a compound R. CO. NHR1 wherein R and R1 are as hereinbefore defined and the hydroxy groups are optionally protected, followed by deprotection of the hydroxy groups where appropriate. The reduction may be carried out by standard reducing agents known for carrying out this type of reduction as outlined in J. March, vide supra, page 1122 , for example, a hydride reagent such as lithium aluminium hydride in an inert solvent, such as an ether, i.e. tetrahydrofuran, at a non extreme temperature, for example, at between Oo and 1000C and conveniently at the reflux temperature of the ether.The compound R. CO. NHR1 may be formed by the reaction of the appropriate acid RCOOH or a suitable reactive acid derivative thereof as outlined in J. March, vide sura, pages 382 390 for example, an acid halide in an inert solvent, with an amine NH2R1 in which the hydroxy groups are optionally protected, for example, when the compound NH2R1 is a diol, by an isopropylidene group. The compound R. CO. NHR1 so formed is suitably reduced in situ and deprotected if necessary to give a compound of formula I . The compounds of the formulaRCOOH can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.3. The reaction of a compound RCH2L wherein Ar is as hereinbefore defined and L is a leaving group , with a compound NH2R1 as hereinbefore defined.Suitable leaving groups are those defined by J. March, vide supra pages 325 331, and include halogens such as chlorine or bromine and sulfonic acid derivatives such as p toluenesulfonate. The reaction is suitably carried out in an appropriate solvent, such as a dipolar aprotic solvent or alcohol at a non extreme temperature, for example 50 1000. The compounds of the formula RCH2L can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.There is therefore provided, as a further aspect of the invention, a method òr the preparation of a compound of formula I comprising any method known for the preparation of analogous compounds, in particular those methods defined in 1 to 3 hereinabove.In a further aspect, the present invention provides novel chemical intermediatesRCH NR1, R. CO. NHR1 or RCH2L as herein before defined. Compounds or the formula I in which one or more of the hydoxy groups are protected, òr example by benzyl, trityl or isopropylidene groups are also useful intermediates of the present invention.The compounds of this invention have biocidal activity, e.g. are toxic to certain living cells which are detrimental to animals such as mammals and poultry, for example pathogenic organisms and tumours. Compounds of this invention are also toxic to organisms which are pathogenic in or detrimental to plants and plant materials.This toxicity to pathogenic organisms has been demonstrated by activity against one or more of the following viruses e.g. Herpes simplex 1 vero , fungi e.g.Microsporum sp., Fusarium solani and trechophyton sp. protozoa e.g. Eimeria ten elba and Trichomonas vaqinalis , bacteria e.g. Mycoplasma smeqmatis andStreptococcus pyqqenes , and helminths e.g. Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Brugia pahangi . The antitumour activity of compounds of formula I has been demonstrated in a number of recognized screens and primarily by activity against ascitic P388 O leukaemia. PreFerred compounds ot the formula I are those which have antitumour activity. The activity against ascitic tumours, including P388 0, is evidenced by reduction of tumour cell number in mammals for example, mice bearing ascitic tumours and their consequent increase in survival duration as compared to an untreated tumour bearing control group. Antitumour activity is further evidenced by measurable reduction in the size of solid tumours following treatment of mammals with the compounds of this invention compared to the tumours of untreated control tumour bearing animals.Compounds o formula I are active against murine tumours such as lymphocytic leukaemia P388 0, lymphocytic leukaemia L1210, melanotic melanoma B16, P815 mastocytoma,MDAY D2 fibrosarcoma, colon 38 adenocarcinoma, M5076 rhabdomyosarcoma and Lewis lung carcinoma. Activity in one or more of these tumour tests has been reported to be indicative of antitumour activity in man A. Goldin et al. in Methods in Cancer Research ed. V.T. DeVita Jr. and H. Busch, 16, 165, Academic Press, N.Y. 1979 .There are sublines of P388 0 which have been made resistant to the following clinically useful agents cytosine arabinoside, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, Lphenylalanine mustard, methotrexate, 5 Suorouracil, actinomycin D, cis platin and bis chloroethylnitrosourea. Compounds of this invention show potent activity against these drug resistant tumours using the procedure for P388 O above. Compounds or formula I have also been round to be active against human tumour cells in primary cultures of lung, ovary, breast, renal, melanoma, unknown primary, gastric, pancreatic, mesothelioma, myeloma, and or colon cancer. As used herein cancer is to be taken as synonymous with malignant tumour or more generally tumour unless otherwise noted. This is a procedure in which the prevention or tumour cell colony formation, i.e. tumour cell replication, by a drug has been shown to correlate with clinical antitumour activity in man D.D. Von Hoff et al., Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology 6, 265 1980 S. Salmon and D.D. Von Hoff, Seminars in Oncology, 8, 377 19813 . Compounds of formula I which have been found to have anti tumour activity intercalate in vitro with DNA this property is determined by viscometric methods using the procedure of W. D. Wilson et al., Nucleic Acids Research 4, 2697 1954 and have a log P as calculated by the method of C. Hansch andA. Leo in Substituent Constants for Correlation Analysis in Chemistry andBiology, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1979, lying in the range between 2.0 and 2.5.As has been described above, the compounds o the present invention are useful for the treatment of tumours. The invention thus further provides a method for the treatment of tumours in animals, including mammals, especially humans, which comprises the administration of a clinically useful amount oF compound o formula I in a pharmaceutically useful form, once or several times a day or other appropriate schedule, orally, rectally, parenterally, or applied topically. In addition, there is provided as a further, or alternative, aspect of the invention, a compound of formula I for use in therapy, oor example as an anti tumour agent.In a still further aspect, there is provided a compound of the formula I for use against pathogenic organisms, for example fungi.The amount of compound Oe formula I required to be effective as a biocidal agent will, of course, vary and is ultimately at the discretion of the medical or veterinary practitioner. The factors to be considered include the condition being treated, the route of administration, and nature of the formulation, the mammal s body weight, surface area, age and general condition, and the particular compound to be administered. A suitable effective antitumour dose is in the range of about 0.1 to about 120 mg kg body weight, preferably in the range of about 1.5 to 50 mg kg, for example 10 to 30 mg kg. The total daily dose may be given as a single dose, multiple doses, e.q., two to six times per day or by intravenous infusion for selected duration.For example, for a 75 kg mammal, the dose range would be about 8 to 9000 mg per day, and a typical dose would be about 2000 mg per day. If discrete multiple doses are indicated, treatment might typically be 500 mg of a compound of formula I given 4 times per day in a pharmaceutically useful formulation.Whilst It is possible for the active compound defined herein as compound of formula 1 , or ether, ester, or salt thereof to be administered alone, it is preferable to present the active compound in a pharmaceutical rormulation. Formulations of the present invention, for medical use, comprise an active compound together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and optionally other therapeutical ingredients. The carrier s must be pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.The present invention, therefore, further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula I in the form of the free base, ether, or ester derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.There is also provided a method for the preparation oS a pharmaceutical formulation comprising bringing into association a compound of formula I an ether, ester, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor.Whilst the antitumour activity of the compounds of formula I is believed to reside in the free base, it is often convenient to administer an acid addition salt of a compound of formula I .The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration. Preferred formulations are those suitable for oral or parenteral administration.The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active compound into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the Formula tions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active compound into assocation with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into desired formulations.Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound as a powder or granules or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or non aqueous liquid such as a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion or a draught. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered active compound with any suitable carrier.A syrup may be made by adding the active compound to a concentrated, aqueous solution of a sugar, for example sucrose, to which may also be added any accessory ingredients. Such accessory ingredient s may include flavourings, an agent to retard crystallization of the sugar or an agent to increase the solubility of any other ingredient, such as a polyhydric alcohol for example glycerol or sorbitol. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a conventional carrier such as cocoa butter.Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of the active compound which is preferably isotonic with the blood o the recipient. Such formulations suitably comprise a solution o a pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt of a compound of the formula I that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient.Thus, such formulations may conveniently contain distilled water, 5 dextrose in distilled water or saline and a pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt of a compound of the formula I that has an appropriate solubility in these solvents, for example the hydrochloride, isethionate and methanesulfonate salts, preferably the latter.Useful formulations also comprise concentrated solutions or solids containing the compound of formula I which upon dilution with an appropriate solvent give a solution suitable for parenteral administration as above.In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the formulations of this invention may further include one or more accessory ingredient s selected from diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives including antioxidants and the like.The hollowing examples are provided by the way of illustration o the present invention and should in no way be construed as a limitation thereof.
