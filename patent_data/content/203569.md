# Ferroelectric liquid crystal cell and its manufacturing method.

## Abstract
A method for the manufacture of a ferroelectric liquid crystal cell which includes ferroelectric liquid crystal sealed in between a pair of opposed but spaced plates 13, 14 , each having formed on one surface a pattern of conductive layer 11, 12 , the plates 13, 14 being disposed with their conductive layers 11, 12 facing each other, the surfaces of the plates 13, 14 are respectively rubbed in at least two di rections 16, 17 prior to the sealing of the ferroelectric liq uid crystal.
