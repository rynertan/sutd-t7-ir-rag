# Method for reducing formation permeability and compositions for use in the method.

## Abstract
A method for reducing formation permeability compris ing mixing a a homopolymer or copolymer of methyl acrylate or hydroxy alkyl acrylate, where the alkyl group is C₂, C₃ or C₄, into which polymer hydrazide groups have been introduced, and b an aldehyde cross linking agent, dispers ing the mixture in an aqueous medium and injecting the aqueous dispersion into a formation, the amounts of the polymer and aldehyde being such that they will form a gel in the aqueous medium. The invention includes compositions for use in the method.
