# Device for locking two members.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for locking together two members which are telescopically movable in relation to each other with a given clearance between the two mem bers, when the device is in the neutral position, for example a rod or a tube inside an outer tube or a rod or a tube inside an outer sleeve. According to the invention there is an annular recess in the area of the inside of the outer member. In this recess 7 there is fitted a sleeve 8 the external dimensions of which are smaller than the external dimensions of the recess so that the sleeve can be displaced in radial direction in the recess. The clearance D1 between the sleeve and the inside of the outer member in the area of the recess is greater than the clearance D2 between the sleeve and the inner member. The inner member 2 extends through the sleeve 8 . A screw 11 or something equivalent is provided for the purpose of displacing the sleeve in radial direction in the recess, in the process of locking, and forcing the sleeve against the inner member in such a manner that the latter is locked between on one side the inside of the sleeve in the area of the application of force and on the other side the inside of the outer member on both sides 4,5 of the recess.

## Description
DEVICE FOR LOCKING TWO MEMBERSFIELD OF INVENTIONThe invention relates to a device for locking together two members which are telescopically movable in relation to each other with a given clearance between the two members when the device is in the neutral position, for example a rod or a tube inside an outer tube or a rod or a tube inside an outer sleeve.PRIOR ARTMany different devices are known for locking two members which in the neutral position are telescopically movable in relation to each other, ranging from simple screw joints, pin and socket joints, keyed joints etc. to sophisticated joints based on expanding clamping means and the like. Common to the first mentioned joints is the characteristic of being simple and cheap, but not completely reliable and or limited in application. It is on the other hand characteristic of the latter joints that they are expensive and complicated, but still not always reliable. Furthermore, in many of the known devices considerable damage to one or both of the members to be joined is assumed.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONThe object of the invention is toprovide a device which is both simple and cheap, but at the same time very reliable. To be more specific, the object is to provide a device which joins by friction locking two members telescopically movable in relation to each other without damage to either of the members in conjunction with the locking process.In addition it is an object of the invention to provide a device which can be utilised in both very small and very large structures and in widely different technical fields in which the stop position of the members in relation to each other must be adjustable. Conceiv able areas of application are for example in nursing equipment, various kinds of stands, machine assembly, supporting members for furniture and carriage seats, scaffolding etc.The invention is here characterised in that in the outer member, in an annular recess in the inside of the member, there is fitted a sleeve the external dimensions of which are smaller than the external dimensions of the recess so that the sleeve is movable in radial direction in the recess, in that the clearance between the sleeve and the inside of the outer member in the area of the recess is greater than the clearance between the sleeve and the inner member on either side of the recess, in that the inner member extends through the abovementioned sleeve and that means are provided for applying from outside, in the locking process, a force to the sleeve whereby the latter is displaced in the abovementioned recess and forced against the inner member in such a manner that the latter is locked between on one side the inside of the sleeve in the area of application of force and on the other side the inside of the outer member on both sides of the recess.The cross sect ions of the two members to be locked together and the sleeve may be circular or polygonal, and other shapes are conceivable provided that the members and the sleeve are movable in radial direction with the abovementioned clearance in order to effect the desired locking.The force required to effect the locking can be obtained by conventional means as for example screws, wedges, lever aggregates, hydraulic and pneumatic pistons etc.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will appear from the following claims and from the following description of some embodiments. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSIn the following description of some chosen embodiments reference is made to attached drawings in whichFig. 1 shows a locking device which can be moved backwards and forwards on a rod, for example a machine stopper,Fig. 2 shows the same device on a smaller scale,Fig. 3 shows a locking device running on a fixed rod, for example a stand for photo equipment,Fig. 4 shows how the stopper according to Fig. 1 can be used for adjusting an outer tube at a desired height,Fig. 5 shows a locking device in which a lower tube is part of a stand and a rod can be adjusted at various heights,Fig. 6 shows an alternative embodiment of the device according to Fig. 5.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSWith reference first to Fig. 1, a locking device is generally designated 1. The latter constitutes at the same time the outer one of the two members to be locked according to the invention. A cylindrical rod 2 constitutes the second member. According to the embodiment the locking device member consists of an outer tube 3 and, in that tube at the ends of it, a pair of cylindrical running rings 4 and 5 the external dimensions of which correspond to the internal dimensions of the tube 3. The running rings 4 and 5 are joined to the tube 3 by welds 6. Alternatively, they can for example be pressed on, stamped on, glued on, or screwed on inside the tube 3. Thus is obtained in the member 1 a recess 7 inside the tube 3 between the running rings 4 and 5.In the recess 7 is provided a metal sleeve, conveniently of steel, of a thinner wall thickness than the rings 4 and 5. The internal diameter of the sleeve 8 is the same as that of the rings 4 and 5 or somewhat larger, whilst the external diameter of the sleeve 8 is smaller than the internal diameter of the outer tube 3, i.e. smaller than the internal diameter of the member 1 in the area of the recess 7. Thus, when the sleeve 8 is co axial with the device 1, there is formed a gap 9 between the sleeve 8 and the outer tube 3.This gap 9 constituting the clearance of the sleeve 8 in the recess 7 is designated D1. The outer sleeve or tube 3 is provided with a welded on connecting piece 10 having a screw 11 by means of which the sleeve 8 can be displaced in radial direction in the recess 7.Through the member 1 extends the second member i.e. the rod 2. In the free fit position the latter is able to run in the device 1 with a given clearance. The clearance between the rod 2 and the locking sleeve 8 is designated D2 According to the invention, locking is obtained if D1 D2, the locking sleeve 8 being forced against the rod 2, when the screw 11 is tightened, until the opposite side of the rod collides with the running rings 4 and 5, provided that Dl D2, in such a manner that the locking sleeve 8 can be displaced freely in the recess 7 on the side of the device which is opposite to the screw 11. Thus locking occurs by jamming between on one side the locking sleeve 8 on the side of the screw 11 and on the other side the two running rings 4 and 5. Figures 2, 3 and 4 show some examples of embodiment of the invention according to Fig. 1. Fig. 2 illustrates the basic construction diagrammatically in the same way as Fig. 1. According to Fig. 3, the locking device 1 is provided with a device 12 which may consist of a suspension device, a plate etc. According to Fig. 4, the device 1 is used as a stopper or check piece for the upper movable tube 13. In the embodiment according to Fig. 5, with reference to Fig. 1, the lower ring 5 is replaced by a tube 5a which constitutes part of a stand. The locking device is in this case designated la and is otherwise shaped in the same way as according to Fig. 1. Fig. 6 differs from the embodiment according to Fig. 1 in that the two running rings are extended and form guide sleeves 4b and 5b.In this case the locking device is designated 1b. The outer.tube 3b is in this case part of a stand. Otherwise the device 1b is shaped in the same way as in preceding embodiments.
