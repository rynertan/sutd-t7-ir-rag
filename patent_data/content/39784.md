# Serial parallel serial charge coupled device.

## Abstract
This serial to parallel to serial SPS charge coupled device CCD shift register memory has a serial output shift register 14 with gate electrode structures that are inter digitated with the gate electrode structures of each last stage of a plurality of parallel shift registers 12 to transfer inter laced data bits from the parallel shift registers to the serial output register in a sequential order.
