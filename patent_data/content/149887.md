# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CASTING SINGLE CRYSTAL ARTICLES

## Abstract
An apparatus for casting doubly oriented single crystal airfoils and similar articles includes a mold having an orientation selector which selects crystals having desired vertical and horizontal orientations. The orientation selector includes an upright primary growth passage having a lower end exposed to the upper side surface of a chill plate. A horizontal secondary growth passage is connected with the upper end of the primary growth passage and with the mold cavity. A gradient inducing passage is connected with the upper end of the primary growth passage and has a lower end exposed to the chill plate to promote the transmission of heat from the upper end of the primary growth passage to the chill plate after metal crystals have solidified in the gradient inducing growth passage.
