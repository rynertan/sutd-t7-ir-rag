# Physiologically active compositions.

## Abstract
It has previously been shown that bivalent antibodies to insulin can mimic the action of insulin in vivo. However antibodies in vivo were believed to have the opposite effect. It has now been found that the administration to vertebrates of certain specific anti hormone antibodies, preferably monoclonal antibodies, with or without adminis tration of the hormone itself, can potentiate the biological action of the hormone. Active immunisation with a fragment of the hormone can also be carried out. Such methods can be used therapeutically or alternatively to increase the response of the vertebrate to the hormone beyond normal physiolo gical levels. When the hormone is growth hormone, acceler ated growth of economically important animals can be achieved.

## Description
Physiologically Active CompositionsThis invention relates to hormone activity in vertebrate species.The term hormone has been defined as encompassing any substance released from one part of the body and acting selectively on at least one other, distant, part. Many such substances are secreted by one of the endocrine glands, an example being the secretion of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. The basis for the selectivity for 2 given target tissue or tissues is the presence or absence in the tissue of receptors which bind the substance specifically. In the case of the protein hormones, such as insulin, the receptors are on the cell surface. Interferon has been implicated in the defence of mammalian cells against viral attack. It is not secreted by an endocrine gland and does not have the specificity of target tissue that, say, growth hormone has. Nevertheless, it is a large glycosylated protein molecule and binds to specific cell surface receptors.There are also certain similar substances which influence the activity of cell by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface, for example tumour necrosis factor and lymphokines such as interleukins. In this specification, the tefrrl. hormone is used to embrace all such protein or polypeptide entities optionally glycosylated and the like having a cell surface receptor.It has been shown that certain antibodies against insulin and against epidermal growth factor EGF potentiate or mimic the activity of those hormones in vitro Y.Schechter et al, Proc.Nat.Acad.Sci.7O 6 ,2720, 1979 and Y. Schechter et al,Nature 278, 835, 1979 . It is thought that this occurs because the antibodies, being bivalent, cause an aggregation of the hormone receptor complexes on the cell surface, such aggregation being involved in activating the second messenger within the cell monovalent Fab fragments of antibodies do not cause such potentiation or mimicry. These studies have solely been concerned with characterising the insulin and EGF receptors and in identifying the mode of action of such hormones.Furthermore, not all such studies have demonstrated such potentiation de Pirro et al Diabetologia 19, 118 1980 and Schechter et at, Proc. Nat.Acad.Sci, 75 12 ,5788 1978 . There has been no suggestion that such potentiation would occur in vivo or that the phenomenon is more widely applicable. Indeed, the generation of antibodies against insulin and other hormones in vivo was thought to be highly undesirable since the hormoneantibody complexes would be cieared by the body s immune system and, far from being potentiated, the action of the hormone would be negated see for example Schwartz J., Endocrinology, 107 4 ,877 Fraisier, Endocrine Reviews 4 2 ,155 and Gause et al, Endocrinology 112 5 ,1559 on growth hormone, andBlake u Kelch, Endocrinology 109 6 ,2175 on luteinising hormone releasing hormone.It has now surprisingly been found that the administration of certain specific antibodies to hormones can potentiate or mimic the activity of the hormone, provided that the epitope specificity of the antibody is chosen appropriately.Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides a formulation comprising antibodies to a hormone, the epitope specificity of at least some or the antibodies being so chosen that the formulation will potentiate or mimic, when administered to a vertebrate, the administration of the hormone in that vertebrate.A second aspect of the invention provides a formulation comprising complexes of a a hormone and b at least one type of antibody to that hormone, the epitope specificity of at least some of the antibodies being so chosen that the formulation will potentiate or mimic, when administered to a vertebrate, the administration of the hormone in that vertebrate.A third aspect of the invention provides a method of potentiating or rnimicking hormone administration in a normal vertebrate as herein defined by administering to the vertebrate a formulation comprising antibodies to the hormone, the epitope specificity of at least some of the antibodies being so chosen that the formulation will potentiate or mimic, when administered to a vertebrate, the administration of the hormone in that vertebrate.The term normal is used herein to indicate an individual having sufficient endogenous amount of the hormone in question for normal functioning of the tissues regulated by that hormone. A fourth aspect of the invention provides a method of potentiating or mimicking hormone administration in a normal vertebrate as herein defined by administering to the vertebrate a formulation comprising complexes of a the hormone and b at least one type of antibody to that hormone, the epitope specificity of at least some of the antibodies being so chosen that the formulation will potentiate or mimic, when administered to the vertebrate, the administration of the hormone in that vertebrate.A fifth aspect provides a method of treating a human or other vertebrate having abnormally low hormone regulated tissue function by administering to the vertebrate a pharmaceutical formulation comprising antibodies to the hormone in question, the epitope specificity of at least some or the antibodies being so chosen that the formulation will potentiate or mimic, when administered to the vertebrate, the administration of the hormone in that vertebrate.A sixth aspect provides a method of treating a vertebrate having an abnormally low hormone regulated tissue function by administering to the human or animal a pharmaceutical formulation comprising complexes of a the hormone in question and b at least one type of antibody to that hormone, the epitope specificity of at least some of the antibodies being so chosen that the formulation will potentiate or mimic, when administered to a vertebrate, the administration of the hormone in that vertebrate.The potentiation or mimicry of the administration of growth hormone, insulin, thyroid stimulating hormone and interferon are particularly preferred aspects of the invention. The clinical abnormalities which result from a deficiency of a given hormone are in many cases well characterised and will not be listed here. However, examples include from a deficiency of growth hormone pituitary dwarfism, Turner s syndrome and cachexia, from a deficiency of insulin diabetes and from a deficiency of thyroid stimulating hormone cretinism, simple goitre and myxedema. By antibody to a particular hormone, we mean an antibody which will bind to that hormone. Thus, the antibody need not have been created in response to that specific hromone. For example several antibodies raised against growth hormone GH will cross react with chorionic somatomammotropin CS because of the extensive sequence homology between the two hormones. Furthermore, it may be possible to raise antibodies to a synthetic analogue or hormone of a portion of it. It is to be noted that the antibodies need not necessarily be to the specific hormone of the species to which the formulation or method of the invention is being applied. Preferably, however, they are. It has been found that not all antibodies to the hormone will potentiate or mimic the administration of that hormone instead, the ability of an antibody to act in accordance with the invention appears to depend on the specific determinant ie. antigenic site for the antibody on the hormone. It will therefore readily be appreciated that polyclonal antibodies that is to say, a collection of antibodies having a range of determinant specificities are less suitable for use in formulations or methods in accordance with the invention, than are monoclonal antibodies.The man skilled in the art will readily, having read this specification, be able by means of rcutine experimentation to select a monoclonal antibody effective in carrying out the invention. Mixtures of suitable monoclonal antibodies may in some circumstances be used. However, it is nevertheless possible to use animal or human antisera raised by conventional immunization provided that the epitope specificity of the antibodies is as described. Particularly preferred monoclonal antibodies for growth hormone GH and chorionic somatomammotropin CS areEBO1 and EB02. Antibody QBO1 is preferred for prolactin PRL .It has been found that the presence of the hormone in the animal is necessary for the antibody when administered alone to act in the manner described.Thus, in the case of normal individuals, administration of the selected antibody alone will have the described effect but, for example, in individuals without endogenous GH, such as pituitary dwarf human children, GH must be administered as well as, but not necessarily simultaneously with, the antibody.Instead of preparing the antibody outside the animal, it is possible to raise antibodies of the appropriate specificity by injecting the animal with a preselected fragment of a suitable growth hormone molecule in combination with an adjuvant. The fragment will be so chosen as to comprise only the epitope or epitopes to which one or more of the hormone potentiating antibodies are specific and may be derived by cleaving the hormone appropriately, or by synthesising a peptide fragment or an analogue to such a fragment . By choosing portions of the hormone rich in hydrophilic residues, one is more likely to be creating or selecting a fragment an antigenic determinant which is on the surface of the complete hormone molecule and which will therefore cross react with the complete molecule.Equally, the fragment should not contain the site of the hormone which binds to the cell surface receptor, nor any site which binds a third agent which causes a conformational change such that receptor binding is inhibited. Otherwise, the antibodies produced are likely to inhibit, rather than potentiate,the action of the hormone. Thus, in a successful immunisation of this type, a polyclonal collection of antibodies of narrow specificity is created within the animal in question, thus enabling less frequent injection of the animal than would be the case if exogenous antibodies were passively administered. It will be appreciated that, instead of an actual fragment, a functional fragment could be used, in which the undesirable epitopes of the molecule are present but are shieided from antibody access in some way.The term fragment is used in this specification to cover actual and functional fragments.Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method of increasing a hormone regulated response of a vertebrate by administering to the vertebrate a preparation comprising at least one pre selected fragment as herein defined of an appropriate hormone, optionally in combination with an adjuvant.The invention also encompasses such a preparation and methods of making such a preparation by conventional means. In such convential vaccines, immunological carriers are frequently used to enhance the immunogenicity of the antigen, for example keyhole limpet haemocyanin or tetanus toxoid.Similarly, adjuvants are often included to stimulate the immune system, for example aluminium hydroxide, saponin or muramyl dipeptide. Generally, about 0.001 to 10j1lmoles of antigen should be present in a unit dose, preferably about 0.01 to 0.04umoles, although the selection of a suitable amount of the antigen is well within the capabilities of one skilled in the art.In the case of passive transfer of antibodies to a vertebrate, approximately 107, preferably 105 106 ABT50 units of antibodies should be administered in any suitable sterile medium, such as saline, to give a dose of 0.01 to 10ml, preferably about 0.5ml.To take only three hormones as an example, namely GH, CS and PRL, formulations or methods in accordance with the invention are believed to offer potential in a accelerating the attainment of full growth of industrially important ie. farmed animals such as cattle, pigs and poultry or achieving such growth on reduced amounts of feed b increasing the growth of such animals beyond the normal maximum c increasing the duration or extent of lactation in mammals, for example to obtain a greater milk yield from cattle or to enable a human mother to breast feed an infant d increasing the proportion of lean meat to fat in farmed animals e increasing the growth of fleece, fur or other useful surface products of animals, for example sheep f treating a GH deficient individual, for example a dwarf child, to enable normal growth to occur. In all cases, it is believed that the use of formulations and or methods in accordance with the invention may offer significant cost saving and labour saving advantages in comparison with the use of the hormone alone, not least because the potentiation of the hormone action is expected to result in fewer administrations being needed. Furthermore, a reduction of possibly harmful residues in the meat or milk of treated animals may be expected. Finally, because farmed animals are frequently routinely injected with other vaccines, for example against foot and mouth disease, it would be extremely convenient to incorporate in such a vaccine a formulation in accordance with the present invention. The invention will now be described by way of the following non limiting Examples.

U.K. and have been characterized extensively Ivanyi, 1982 a b, Aston and Ivanyi, 1983 . BABBLE mouse spleen cells were fused with NSI myeloma cells and cloned by standard techniques Ivanyi and Davis, 1980, 1981 .The antibodies derived were all of the IgO1 isotype and were non precipitating when examined by double diffusion in agar. Four determinants have been defined on hOH by competition assays QAó8, NA71, EBO1 and EBO2 of which two are completely shared with hCS EBO1 and EBO2 . However, none of the antibodies cross reacted with human prolactin. Antibody concentrations have been expressed as ABT50 values which correspond to the reciprocal antibody titre required to give 50 percent binding of 1251 hOH by RIA Ivanyi, 1982a . Binding studies with proteolytically modified forms of hGH suggest that all four determinants are located in the first 1 139 redidues with the EBO1 determinant also represented in the sequence region 146 191 Aston and Ivanyi, 1983 .Example 2 PREPARATION OF Fab FRAGMENT OF EBO1Ascitic globulin 5mg ml of EBO1 was affinity purified on hGH 100mg immobilized on CNBr activated Sepharose. Retained material was eluted with glycine HCl buffer pH 2.3 and tubes containing protein material were immediately adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH lM . The purified antibody was concentrated to 20mg ml 2ml and dialysed against sodium phosphate buffer 0.5M, pH 8.0 containing cysteine 0.01M and EDTA .002M .This material was digested with 0.4mg of papain BDH for 4 hours at 37 0C followed by dialysis against PBS to remove the cysteine and EDTA.Subsequently, the dialysate was applied to a column of DEAE cellulose 20cm x 1.2cm and eluted with a linear gradient consisting of sodium phosphate buffer 0.005M û.3M, pH 8.0 . The first peak to be eluted from the column contained no antibody heavy chain as determined by SDS PAGE and retained an activity of 10 x ABT50. Example 3 HORMONESHuman growth hormone employed for injection was derived from stocks of outdated clinical grade material obtained by special agreement with the Institute ofChild Health, London, whereas hormone used in assays was of 99 purity. hGH is avaiable from RIA UK Ltd, Washington, Co. Durham U.K. Radioiodination of hGH was performed with lactoperoxidase resulting in a tracer of high specific activity 80 x 106 cpm g Linde et al, 1981 . Monomeric 125I hOH was separated from any aggregated material prior to assay by Ultrogel column chromatography.Ultrogel is a trade mark of LKB Ltd, Cambridge, U.K. Antibody hormone complexes for administration into animals were prepared by mixing the solutions for 1 hour prior to injection. In chronic experiments, where injections were given for several weeks, the complexes were prepared in batches enough for 1 week and stored at 40C. A soluble extract was prepared from the marmoset pituitary gland by homogenizing the tissue in 0.05M sodium bicarbonate 2mM PMSF pH 8.6. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 10,0009 for 20 minutes and the supernatant 20ml was tested.BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLESExample A CUMULATIVE WEIGHT GAINS IN hGH EBO1 COMPLEX TREATEDDWARF MICEDwarf mice were bred from normal animals heterozygous for the dw gene or from a heterozygous female mouse and a male homozygous dwarf mouse treated with thyroxine. The dwarf mice, weighing 9.1 0.49, were allocated at random to treatment groups of six animals and then distributed among several small cages each containing one representative of each treatment group. Hormones were injected subcutaneously in the back in 0.lml, for the periods indicated. Weights were measured at the onset, during and sometimes after treatment. Weight gains in short term experiments or the cumulative weight gains over several days of study were expressed as relative values related.to initial whole body weights or as net weights g .Tail lengths were measured by the method of Hughes andTanner 1970 .Over a three week period, control mice, treated with phosphate buffered saline PBS , increased their relative weight gains by about 15 Figure 1 . Mice treated with 10b9 hGH gained 22 over starting weight over the same period. However, hGH EBO1 complexes raised the cumulative weight gain to 34 , which corresponds to an additional 12 increment over that achieved from treatment with hGH only.Raising the hGH dose in the complex from 10 g to 160 pg, increased the weight gains to 44 of the initial body weight. It is apparent Figure 1 that the differences between treated groups and controls progressively increased over the 21 day test period. Whilst hGH MAB complexes produced a significant increment within 48h, the difference between the group treated with hGH only and the PBSinjected control group was not apparent until day 7. Example B GROWTH POTENTIATION BY EBO1 Fab FRAGMENTSIn order to assess whether the bivalency of EBO1 antibody was a pre requisite for growth potentiation, complexes of EBO1 Fab hGH were examined for their effects on 35SO4ê uptake in dwarf mice.Dwarf mice within a relatively narrow weight range 7 10g were randomized by use of tables of random numbers Fisher and Yates, 1957 and injected with a dose 35 2 of SO4 related to body weight 0.5 Ci g body weight 24h after the final hormone injection Herbai, 1970 . Mice were killed 20h later when rib cages were removed, placed in boiling water for 20 min, soaked overnight in saturated sodium sulphate and washed in tap water for 2 h and distilled water for 1 h. The bony portion of ribs together with about 1 mm of adjacent rib cartilage costochondral junction was then cut away leaving the costal cartilages attached to the sternum.All adhering soft tissue was removed and the five longest costal cartilages which articulated directly with the sternum were detached whole from each side of the rib cage and combined for each animal. Each pool of ten costal cartilages was then dried at room temperature overnight, weighed and processed for the measurement of 35so 2 The uptake of 55SO42 by costal cartilage was expressed as 4 . 2 disintegrations per minute per mg of cartilage.The levels of sulphate uptake by cartilage potentiated by EBO1 or EBO1 Fab were not significantly different when comparing the antibody and fragments at the same ABT50 dose Table 1 . However, the growth observed in the presence of hGH alone was significantly less than that observed for Fab hGH.Increasing the valency of the Fab fragment by including a second either monoclonal anti light chain antibody TC187 or polyclonal anti mouse Ig antibody did not significantly alter the 35So42 uptake. Furthermore, Fab fragments did not competitively inhibit the potentiating effect of EBO1 antibody. Preparation of complexes ofEBO1 with equimolar quantities of hGH and hCS also did not decrease the degree of potentiation.Such complexes would comprise mainly the species hGH EBO1 hCS which would be expected to have decreased activity if bivalency was necessary, since hCS has only 10 somatotropic activity of hGH. Indeed, theEBO1 hCS complex resulted in significantly lower growth activity than the corresponding complex with hGH.

Example C DOTENTIATION OF GROWTH IN JUVENILE BALBIc MICESince the stimulation of growth in dwarf mice is exercised over a background of very slow activity, it was of interest to ascertain if the antibody mediated potentiation effect could be demonstrated in normally, i.e. rapidly, growing juvenile mice. Three week old BALBIc mice weighing between 7 109 were randomized and injected as described above for dwarf mice. Weights were taken 3 times week in chronic experiments.Group 1 received PBS twice weekly throughout Group 2 had 160yug hGH three times over 1 week and Group 3 the same thrice weekly for 4 weeks Groups 4 and 5 had complexed 160 hGH 200 g EB01 thrice weekly for 1 or 4 weeks respectively and Group 6 had daily injections of the said complex for 4 weeks. Groups 5 and 6 grew by 31 and 37 more than PBS injected controls Fig. 2 . A significant weight gain effect of hGH EBO1 complexes was apparent as early as 48 hours after administration Table 2 .Animals receiving 10, 40 or 160vug of hGH in the presence of EBO1 demonstrated a significant weight gain increment when compared with hGH only.

Example D POTENTIATION OF THE LACTOGENIC ACTIVITY OF hGHHuman growth hormone produces significant lactogenic activity as measured by its effects on pigeon crop sac or mammary tissue in vivo and by its ability to displace 125I hPRL from binding to mammary gland receptors. The pigeon crop sac bioassay procedure measures the lactogenic activity of hormones and is analogous to other mammotropic assays involving either mammary gland or corpus luteum of rats or mice. Hormones, complexes or control solutions were administered 0.lml from coded vials intradermally adjacent to each hemicrop, there being five birds in each group. The injection protocol was either one administration on day 1 only 2X104 ABT50 or three over 36 hours each of 2X103 ABT50 or combined with two further injections on day 2.Birds were killed on day 3 and the wet weight of the crop sac mucosa of 2.5 cm diameter was determined Nicoll, 1967 . By administering the complex or free hormone intradermally, adjacent to each of the two individual hemicrops, the potentiation effect has been examined under conditions which excluded systemic hormone distribution. The weight of the cropsac mucosa following the injection of 100 cL9 of hGH in three doses was about 100mg, whereas the control PBS or antibody only treated mucosa weighed 10 13mg Figure 3 .Treatment with 10, g of hormone alone produced a mucosa of 48mg, but in the presence of EBO1 or EB02 the mucosal weight increased to 108mg and 80mg respectively. As in dwarf mice, NA71 was without potentiating activity whereasQA68 significantly depressed the mucosal secretion. Furthermore, EBO1 potentiated the lactogenic effects proportionally by the same extent whether the hormone was administered in one or three doses. However, EBO1 failed to potentiate the lactogenic effect of saturating doses of hGH. Since EBO1 binds equally to hCS, we also examined the potentiation of the lactogenic activity of this hormone. The results show that antibody complexes with 10 g hCS had doubled the weight of the crop sac mucosa in comparison with controls receiving the hormone alone.Example E POTENTIATION OF GROWTH IN MARMOSETSThe potentiation effect in either murine growth or pigeon crop sac responses was dependent on the administration of exogenous hGH since none of the antibodies described here cross reacted with the rodent growth hormone. However, we discovered that EBO1 antibody did bind to marmoset growth hormone when tested by immunoblot assay. This observation enabled the assessment of EBO1 potentiation of marmoset growth in the absence of any exogenously administered hormone Figure 4 . Sixteen animals, randomised on a weight basis, were divided into four groups receiving 0.4mg hGH only, hGH 0.4mg EBO1 2mg , EBO1 2mg only or PBS three times per week Two sister animals had to be removed from the experiment after 1 week due to continuous weight loss.Animals treated for 44 days with PBS increased their weight by 689, whereas the group receiving EBQ1 only demonstrated a mean weiqht ncrease of about 1039. Groups receiving hormone only or complex had weight gains intermediate to those observed withEBO1 only and the control group. The relative weight gain over initial body weight of animals receiving antibody was 89 whilst the control group increased their body weights by only 61 . Despite continuous administration of heterologous antibody to the marmosets for 6 weeks, side effects, possibly of anaphylactic origin, have so far not been observed.Example F FURTHER PIGEON CROP SAC ASSAYThe pigeon crop sac assay of Example D was repeated with lyug of highly purified prep. L or 3 g9 of QBO1 MAB affinity purified prep. R hPRL alone or in complex with a constant dose, 2500 ABT50 of monoclonal antibodies. The preparation of OlBOl antibodies was analogous to that described in Example 1 above and has been published Ivanyi Davies, 1981 .The results, given in Table 3, show strong potentiation for antibody QBO1, for both preparations of hPRL.

The mice were assessed for overall growth 55504 uptake into intercostal cartilage, sulphate injected at day nine , fat content, 4 weight change and length of tail. The results are presented in Tables 4 to 7.It is apparent that the use of a hormone antibody complex can compensate for a reduced diet and can also reduce the proportion of fat in an animal by preferentially causing growth of muscle, the latter advantage being even more marked with a reduced diet.TABLE 4 Sulphate Uptake into Intercostal CartilageEMI18.1 tb SEP DET SEP tb SEP 100 SEP 75 SEP 50 tb Treatment tb Saline SEP 2393 SEP SEP 695 SEP 540 tb SEP 315 SEP 76 SEP 57 tb hGH SEP 5569 SEP SEP M92 SEP 2958 SEP .

Example J Potentiation of Ovine Growth Hormone ActivityMonoclonal antibodies to ovine ie. sheep growth hormone oGH were prepared in an analogous way to the method of Example 1, and are available from theDepartment of Experimental Immunobiology, Wellcome Research Laboratories,Langley Court, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 3BS, UK. Dwarf mice, which respond to oGH, were divided into groups of six and treated with 50,ig of the hormone, either alone or complexed with one of four such antibodies, on two consecutive days prior to injection with 35SO4. Intercostal cartilage was removed 24 hours later, dissolved in formic acid and the radioactivity counted.The results are given inTable 1 Table 10 Treatment MAB titre Uptake of 4 mean S.E. cpm mg tissue oGH alone 1411 261 oGH 1D11 H9 1x10 4 5871 1339OGH 4B62 D9 3.2X104 4323 671 oGH 2B11 4.2X10 3408 642 oGH 3B11 5.6X102 3434 719Saline 557 t 79 Example K Potentiation of Growth in SheepGroups of two sheep mean weight 17kg were treated with differing doses of antioGH antibody 2B11 see Example 3 or, as a control, mouse globulin, on two consecutive days before intraperitoneal injection of 35SO4 146XuCi kg .

A deficiency of TSH causes involution of the thyroid gland and flattening of the epithelium. ln humans, such a deficiency can be responsible for cretinism, simple goitre and the panoply of abnormal conditions known collectively as myxedema. It may be treated with iodine compounds or thyroid gland extracts. Dwarf mice are hypopituitary and the thyroid gland is involuted. Treatment with TSH raises the serum T4 levels and causes some histological repair of the thyroid.A monoclonal antibody GC73 to TSH was prepared analogously to those ofExample l above and is available from the same address as in Example J. GC73 is specific for the chain of TSH. Dwarf mice were randomly divided into groups of five and treated accordingly to the regimes of Table 13 on five consecutive days before analysis of the serum for T4 level by radioimmunoassay, and microscopic histological inspection of thyroid tissue, fixed in 10 formalin in saline solution and then embedded in wax or plastic. The T4 data are given in Table 13 the results were confirmed by microscopic examination.
