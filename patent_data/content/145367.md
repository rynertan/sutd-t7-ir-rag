## Description
DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR MAKING YEAST LEAVENED FROZEN, LAMINATED AND OR SWEET PASTRY DOUGHTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method for producing yeast leavened, frozen, laminated and or sweet pastry products which may be removed from the freezer and baked without the necessity of having to undergo further proofing or leavening. Presently available, yeast containing, frozen pastry products are either fully leavened and baked before freezing or else frozen before any significant leavening or baking has occurred. In the former case, the user of the frozen product merely reheats the frozen pastry prior to sale and or serving to the consumer however, these products can neither be called freshly baked nor do they possess the flavor, texture and aroma of freshly baked yeast leavened pastries. In the latter case, the frozen pastry must undergo rather lengthy thawing and proofing steps prior to being subjected to elevated baking temperatures. This thawing and proofing cycle is not only time consuming, which is costly to a commercial baker, but also involves an amount of skill and judgment on the part of the baker so that only properly proofed pastries are placed in the oven. Commercially available unproofed frozen doughs are totally dependent upon the viability of the yeast contained within the frozen dough to obtain proofing leavening. It has been established, however, that yeast viability decreases in proportion to the time of frozen storage. To overcome the problem of yeast kill, which becomes more dramatic if significant fermentation is permitted to take place prior to freezing the dough, it is conventional to virtually eliminate fermentation activity prior to freezing.Such a process is set forth in an article entitled Frozen Bread Dough , The Bakers Digest, Volume 42,No. 5 at pages 44 50 October 1968 . It is also known in the art to add a surplus quantity of yeast to the dough in order to account for the effect of yeast kill during frozen storage. It remains a problem however to be able to obtain consistent proofing of frozen doughs after thawing. It would be desirable if frozen, unbaked pastry products were available which could be taken directly from the freezer and fully baked in an oven within a relatively short time period e.g., less than one hour without having to be held at room temperature for several hours in order to effect additional yeast activity. Such frozen product would enable a commercial, retail baker to quickly respond to sudden increases in demand for freshly baked pastries.The bakery would then not be faced with having excess baked pastries which were fully prepared to meet a consumer demand which did not materialize.Nor would the bakery find itself out of freshly baked pastries and not be able to respond to unexpectedly high demand. It would also be desirable to eliminate the need for having a skilled baker or a proofing cabinet on location in order to prepare fresh baked, yeast leavened pastries which possess good flavor, texture and aroma. Such frozen products would also be of great benefit to the home consumer as well as the hotel and restaurant trade as any of the users would be able, on relatively short notice and in essentially a fool proof manner, to prepare freshly baked, laminated and or sweet baked goods. The frozen doughs of the present invention are not dependent upon yeast activity or viability after freezing. According to the present invention any rise in the dough which occurs after freezing, such as the oven spring which occurs during baking, is due to expansion of carbon dioxide or other gases already contained within the dough. The proofed, frozen doughs of this invention are able to expand and set in the expanded form during the baking cycle due to the fact that the dough, as a result of the gluten conditioning which occurs during the proofing step, possesses proper elasticity. It is well known in the art that the viability of yeast contained in frozen doughs decreases in proportion to the length of frozen storage. This fact is noted by Kline and Sugihara, The Bakers Digest, 44 5, October, 1968, pages 44 50 where it is also stated that fermentation should be virtually eliminated prior to freezing since dormant yeast is less vulnerable than yeast which has reached a state of incipient growth. Other prior art references such as U.S. Patent Nos. 3,375,107 to Schemmer and 3,894,155 to Ono et al. are in accord. The susceptibility to yeast kill of commercially available, unproofed frozen doughs is often apparent when the doughs on occassion, lose the ability to adequately proof after three months of frozen storage.As the proofed frozen doughs of the present invention do not require any post freezing yeast viability, the doughs will exhibit a higher degree of frozen storage stability.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates broadly to the production of proofed and frozen, yeast leavened pastry products which can be removed from the freezer and, without an intervening proofing step, be placed in an oven, which is either set to reach a baking temperature of at least 2750F or already preheated to such baking temperature, and thereafter fully baked. The baking period will obviously depend upon the size of the pastry product being baked with small items such as croissants, typically being baked at 3500 to 4500F within 25 minutes and large items such as 20 ounce danish rings, typically being baked at about 3500F within 60 minutes. According to the invention, the term pastry is meant to include non bread items such as croissants, danish pastries and sweet rolls, all of which are prepared by one or more sheetings of a fermented dough which dough is thereafter cut and formed into the desired shape. Further according to this invention, the shaped dough pieces are at least partially proofed and then frozen. The dough formulation employed in the present invention will vary among themselves depending upon the type of pastry product being prepared. The proofed doughs will, however, contain a fat level of from 15 to 65 , whole egg liquid of from 5 to 25 , non fat milk solids of from 4 to 12 and a sugar level of from 3 to 25 . Unless otherwise noted, all percentages refer to baker s weight precents wherein the weight of each non flour ingredient contained in the dough is expressed as a weight percent of the flour ingredient of the dough. The flour employed in the process of this invention will be a wheat flour which has a protein content of less than 16 protein by weight and will typically be from 11.5 to 14.5 by weight protein.Such flour may be obtained from hard red winter and hard red spring wheats which may be blended or air classified in order to obtain a flour having the desired protein level. The fat ingredient which may include such materials as butter, margarine and or vegetable shortening may be included as a component of the base dough formulation i.e., the dough prepared prior to any sheeting operation and or as a roll in ingredient coated onto a sheeted dough in one or more separate operations . Regular sweet doughs such as used in the production of sweet rolls and coffee cakes will contain from 15 to 25 of fat in the dough itself with little or no fat present as a roll in. Roll in sweet doughs, such as Danish pastry, will normally contain from 5 to 20 fat in the dough itself and an additional 15 to 50 fat present as a roll in ingredient. Sweet doughs, both regular and roll in, will typically contain a sugar level in the dough itself which is at least about as great as the fat level in the dough itself. Pastry doughs, which are used in the production of such non sweet, laminated pastry products as croissants and short pastry will typically have a fat content of from 40 to 60 , with essentially all of this fat being present as a roll in component. According to the process of this invention, the various doughs described above are prepared utilizing either the straight dough, including short time processes, or the sponge dough procedures which are commonly employed by skilled bakers. The straight dough process mixes all of the dough ingredients together except roll in ingredients and then ferments the dough for a short period, typically from 30 to 120 minutes at a temperature between 650 to 900F 180 to 32 C . Usually in the straight dough process the fat and dough additives are mixed or churned at slow speeds followed by the addition of an aqueous yeast solution, flour and the balance of the water. In the straight dough process, the order in which the various ingredients are added to the mixer can be varied considerably. In the sponge dough process, the major fermentation action takes place in a pre ferment in which water, yeast and a portion of the flour are fermented for several 3 to 5 hours and the resulting sponge is then combined with the remaining dough ingredients.The dough is then subjected to a second ferment for a period of from ten minutes up to about one hour at from 650 to 900F 18 to 320C . The fermented pastry doughs are sheeted to a thickness of from 2 to 10 millimeters and any desired roll in fat ingredient may be coated onto the dough surface. The roll in and laminating procedures suitable for use in this invention may be any of those known and employed in the baking industry and can and will vary depending on the equipment available and the desired end product. According to one such process, the roll in is coated across two thirds of the dough sheet and then the uncoated portion of the sheet is folded onto the central third of the sheet followed by folding the remaining coated third of the sheet on top of the uncoated surface. In this manner, a laminate of three dough layers separated by two fat layers is formed.Should additional laminations be desired in the final product, successive sheeting roll in coating and folding cycles may be repeated. Usually a resting period of at least 15 minutes, preferably at a temperature of between 350 and 42 F 1.70 to 5.50C is included between each cycle so that the dough may be more readily handled. A final sheeting step, which may occur after a prolonged e.g., 4 to 12 hours refrigerated rest period, will usually be effected in the production of laminated pastry products such as danish and croissants. The sheeted doughs of the invention will be cut into a desired form and rolled or folded into the shape of the pastry product intended. Fruit fillings, cinnamon, nuts and or fruit pieces may be added into the pastry product either before or after shaping the pastry product. Of course, it would be possible to add these types of ingredients onto the shaped pastry product immediately before baking. The shaped pastry dough is then subjected to a proofing step wherein it is held at a temperature of from 800 to 1050F and a relative humidity of at least 60 for a period of at least 20 minutes. It is also within the scope of this invention to include chemical leavening agents within the dough formulation. These agents may be non heat activated leavening agents, such as, sodium bicarbonate in combination with various tartrate, pyrophosphate or orthophosphate salts, such that the proofing which is effected prior to freezing is a result of a combination of yeast and chemical generation of carbon dioxide. Alternatively or addition ally these agents may be heat activated leavening agents, such as ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium carbonate, which would provide increased oven spring during the baking cycle. The proofing time, when combined with the time the dough or dough ingredients have undergone fermentation i.e., held at a temperature in excess of 420F , will usually be greater than two hours. The proofing time must be long enough to permit the dough to achieve a volume increase of from at least 55 to less than 200 over the volume of the shaped unproofed pastry dough. This degree of proof is required in order to obtain a frozen, proofed pastry product which will have good storage stability, and an ability to achieve a controlled positive oven spring, even when baked directly from a frozen state.If the proofing step is extended to a point where more than a 200 volume increase is obtained, the proofed dough is excessively weak and subject to collapse during handling in the plant, either before freezing or during freezing shrinkage of the frozen proofed dough during prolonged storage and or failure of the dough to rise in the oven during baking. If the proofing step does not effect a volume increase of at least 55 , the baked product will have a structure which is irregular or shredded in appearance and or the baked product will likely be too dense. The extent of proofing may also be characterized by the specific volume achieved by the frozen, proofed dough. Specific volume measurement would, of course, be made on sections of the proofed dough which do not contain added materials such as fruit and nuts and which also is free of voids which result from any rolling or folding operation. For regular sweet doughs, the required specific volume ranges from about 1.43 to 2.17 cc gram. For roll in sweet doughs, the specific volume range is from about 1.26 to 2.72 cc gram and for non sweet, laminated pastry doughs the specific volume range is about 1.82 to 3.57 cc gram. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the richness of the dough will be inversely related to the specific volume of the dough due to the weight of added ingredients. Richness is a term of art which refers to the level of non flour ingredients such as sugar, fat and egg components, contained in the dough, with richer doughs having a higher level of these ingredients. It is important that freezing of the proofed pastry be accomplished at a relatively slow rate.The conventional cryogenic freezing methods used for the preparation of unproofed, frozen doughs is not suitable for use in this invention. This results from the fact that the delicate nature of the proofed dough is such that too rapid of a freezing can cause collapse of the extended gluten film. Furthermore, since the yeast cells are in a rapid growth state they are highly sensitive to rupture as a result of rapid freezing. Any rupturing of yeast cells will cause the release of glutathione which can lead to undesirable surface mottling of the baked product.The exact time of freezing will, of course, be dependent upon the size of the pastry product however, the pastry should be frozen from ambient room temperature to a core temperature of 300F 1.1 C in a time period which is greater than thirty minutes. Ambient temperature within the freezer must not be lower than 400F 400C and will typically be within the range of 100F 17.7 C to 400F. The core temperature of the dough will normally be reduced to 100F 12.2 C within about 2 hours after which the dough may be placed into frozen storage where further reduction in temperature can be effected. The frozen pastry products of this invention may be stored for prolonged periods of time in commercial and or home food freezers having a temperature greater than 40 F 400C and typically between about 50F 20.60C and 150F 9.40C . Temperatures below 400F 400C should be avoided as yeast rupture and freeze dehydration can result. The frozen products may be removed from a food freezer and placed directly into a preheated electric or gas oven or alternatively into an oven which is turned on and set to baking temperature i.e., cold oven without any intervening, thawing or proofing step. It is within the scope of this invention to permit some thawing of the proofed frozen dough to occur before placing the dough into the oven. Such a thawing step would more readily permit expansion or oven spring to occur during the baking cycle as the dough structure is softer and more able to rise in the oven due to the bubbles of gas e.g, carbon dioxide entrapped within the proofed dough expanding as the gas is heated to baking temperature. Such thaw periods could extend up to about four hours but more typically would be less than one or two hours.The frozen yeast would not become active i.e., generate additional C02 during these relatively short thaw periods. The time and temperature for baking the frozen pastry product will depend upon the type and size of the product. Normally baking temperature will be from 1650 to 2350C and the baking time will be less than 45 minutes, typically from 20 to 40 minutes. During the baking cycle the frozen pastry product thaws, rises and bakes in a manner not heretofore thought possible for frozen pastry doughs.Although it has previously been shown that bread doughs might be proofed and frozen and thereafter baked without an intervening proofing step, it was not expected that a sugar and or fat ladened, sheeted pastry dough would be capable of forming a proofed and frozen pastry product which could be baked immediately from the freezer without an intervening proofing step. As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, pastry dough, because of its richer dough formulation and or the use of flours having lower protein content, will have a gluten content considerably less than that of bread dough and will not readily proof or develop the pastry gluten film which is sought in the production of bread dough.A typical bread dough would have a gluten content of 6.7 based on the weight of the dough whereas a typical pastry dough, such as may be used in this invention, will have a gluten protein content of less than 6 , preferably less than 5 , based on the weight of the dough. The less than fully developed pastry doughs of this invention are characterized by the fact that the pastry dough is mixed only to pick up or at most clean up such that full development of the dough as is effected in the preparation of bread doughs, is not permitted to occur. It is unexpected therefore that pastry dough, wherein an underdeveloped gluten structure is called upon to support a rich or dense dough, would retain its proofed volume through freezing, frozen storage and baking. The stages of dough development during mixing are well standardized and known in the baking art and are more fully described by E.J. Pyler inBaking Science and Technology Sibel Publishing Co.,Chicago, I11., 1979 at pages 596 to 608 which are hereby incorporated by reference. Briefly however, pick up is the stage of mixing where the dry and wet materials have mixed only to the point of combining together, with the dough mass being wet, rough and uneven and with the gluten structure begining to gorm. In the clean up phase the dough becomes drier and more elastic and begins to form into a more cohesive mass which is both stiff and wet in spots.The point, during mixing, at which the dough cleans away from the back of the mixer bowl constitutes the end of the clean up 1 period or stage.From this point on, the dough enters the final development stage during which the dough mass transforms from having a dull, somewhat rough appearance to having as smooth, satiny sheen. The dough can be stretched into a semi transparent membrane of essentially uniform thickness without rupturing.Prior to dough development, the stretched dough membrane exhibits strands or lumps and ruptures more readily.BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION This invention is further described but not limited to the following examples EXAMPLE 1 Croissant Sponge Process Dough Formulation Baker s Flour 11.5 protein 100 Compressed yeast 5Sugar 6Vegetable shortening 5Nonfat dry milk 3Salt 1.8Water 60Ascorbic Acid 0.01Unsalted butter as roll in 50 The dough sponge was prepared by mixing 40 of the total flour, 45 of the total water, the gluten, yeast and ascorbic acid and fermenting the mix at 75 for 3 to 4 hours.

The yeast was hydrated with a portion of the water 2 3 weight ratio and creamed together with the conditioner, sugar, shortening, egg yolk, emulsifier, yeast food, Emplex and flavors for four minutes using a low speed. The remaining ingredients were then added and low speed mixing continued for one minute, followed by higher speed mixing for five minutes at which point the pick up phase was completed.The dough temperature was then about 650F. The dough was then sheeted to about 12 mm, folded in thirds and then turned 900, sheeted and folded two times. The dough was next retarded at 400F 4.40C for 4 to 6 hours, sheeted as before, coated on one half with a cinnamon butter cream filling as 1 part filling to 9 parts dough and folded in half. The folded dough was then sheeted to about 7 mm, cut into 17.8 cm strips, rolled into a tight cylinder and cut into 42.5 g pieces which were coated with an egg wash. The piece were proofed at 950F 350C and 75 R.H. for about 40 minutes and increase in volume of about 65 . The proofed pieces were then staticfrozen and stored at OOF. After about 30 days frozen storage the frozen pieces were removed from the freezer and immediately baked at 3750F 1900C for 35 40 minutes.A positive oven spring was observed as a result of baking and the baked product had an excellent fresh baked taste, texture and aroma.

The dough was then given a final sheeting to 3 mm, cut into triangles, coated with fruit jam 9 1 dough to jam on one half of top surface, folded and edges crimped. Decorative slits were placed in the top surface and an egg wash coating was applied. The pastries were then frozen for one hour in a 25 F 31.60C blast freezer and stored at OOF 17.7 C . After 4 months storage, the pastries were removed from the freezer and placed directly in a 375 F oven and baked for between 20 and 25 minutes. The resulting products were of excellent quality and possessed a short, flaky texture.Having thus described the invention what is claimed is
