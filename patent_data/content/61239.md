# System for pumping subterranean fluids.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for pumping oil or other fluids from the earth is disclosed as susing a submersible pump 101 which is suspended in a hole 1 drilled into the earth by means of a flexible cable 103 . Encased in a flexible sheath 147 with the cable are a power cable 143 for the pump and a flexible hose 141 to carry the oil from the pump to the surface of the earth. Control and signal wires 163 may also be encased in the sheath for connection to transducers mounted on the pump. The pump may be easily inserted into or removed from the hole by using a reeling mechanism 281, 305, 289 on the surface of the earth. The pump itself may comprise a submersible motor 109 connected to a rotary to a linear motion transducer 111 that causes a pump barrel 115 to reciprocate. The pump barrel moves over a stationary pump plunger 123 , and there are ball check valves 131, 135 in both the barrel and plunger to control the entrance and exit of oil.
