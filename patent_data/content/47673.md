# Phase discriminator circuit.

## Abstract
A phase discriminator circuit is described comprising squaring circuits 10 and 12 to convert the input signals into square waves, an adder 14 , a full wave rectifier 16 and a circuit 18 for altering the mean DC value of the rectified signal. The output of the circuit 18 is positive when the inputs have the same polarity and negative when they have opposite polarity. The signal is integrated by integrator 20 the output of which is compared with a reference threshold in a level detector 22 . A control circuit 24 adjusts the threshold of detector 22 to provide hys teresis. A differentiating circuit 26 provides differential feed back from the output to the integrator 20 to improve the response time.
