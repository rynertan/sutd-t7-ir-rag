# Coupling and decoupling aid for an electrical connector.

## Abstract
A wire frame aid 34 is received over the cable 14 and the connector part that carries the coupling housing 13 . At one end of the frame coded keys 25 interlockingly engage keys 15 and keyways 16 on the outer surface of the coupling housing 13 . The aid 34 is gripped by one or both hands when it is desired to rotate the housing providing greater purchase of the hand and additional leverage for opening or closing the connector, as the case may be. An elongated slotlike opening 23 enables the aid to be slipped on and off the cable 14 and connector 10 , as desired. In a second version, an elongated hollow metal body 26 having a bore sufficient to permit receipt onto the cable has an enlarged threaded end 27 which is received onto a similarly threaded portion 28 of the coupling housing. The end portion 30 of the metal body opposite the threaded end is provided with transversely extending parts 32,33 which can be gripped with the hand or fingers, or with a suitable tool during use.
