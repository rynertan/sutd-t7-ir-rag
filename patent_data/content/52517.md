## Description
CONCENTRATED FABRIC SOFTENING COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to fabric softening compositions and, in particular, to compositions in aqueous medium which contain a relatively high proportion of cationic fabric softening ingredients. Conventional rinse added fabric softening compositions contain fabric softening agents which are substantially water insoluble cationic materials usually having two long alkyl chains. Typical of such materials are distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride and imidazolinium compounds substituted with two stearyl groups.These materials are normally prepared in the form of an aqueous dispersion or emulsion, and it is generally not possible to prepare such aqueous dispersions with more than about 6 of cationic materials without taking special precautions to ensure acceptable viscosity and stability characteristics. Indeed, with cationic levels in excess of about 8 the problems of physical instability and high viscosity become, in the case of conventional fabric softening products, almost intractable. The formulation of fabric softener compositons with low levels of the active softener ingredients adds substantially to distribution and packaging costs. In addition to shipping and packaging economy, another advantage of a more concentrated fabric softening composition is that it permits the consumer to exercise choice in the type of performance desired, in that the concentrated product can either be used as such or can be diluted to a conventional concentration before use. This opens up the possibility of supplying the concentrated fabric softening composition in a more economically packaged form intended for making up by the consumer into a conventional bottle. The problem of preparing fabric softening compositions in concentrated form suitable for consumer use has already been addressed in the art, but the various solutions proposed have not been entirely satisfactory. U.S. Pat. No. 3,681,241, Rudy, issuedAugust 1, 1972, utilizes a combination of quaternary ammonium softener, saturated imidazolinium softener, unsaturated imidazolinium softener and ionizable salts to formulate concentrated softeners, but the maximum concentration achieved in that patent is only 13 . The use of certain special processing techniques for reducing viscosity has also been suggested for example, inU.S. Pat. No. 3,954,634, Monson, issued May 4, 1976 but again this does not provide a complete and satisfactory solution, and it is not an easy matter to adopt this type of process on a commercial scale. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,155,855, Goffinet et al., issued May 22, 1979, concentrated fabric softeners are disclosed which comprise three active softening ingredients, one of which is a highly soluble cationic fabric substantive agent. While such compositions do allow a high cocentzation of active ingredient, their overall softening performance is less cost effective than is the case with compositions containing predominantly a water insoluble cationic softener. In U.S. Pat. No.4,149,978, Goffinet, issued April 17, 1979, mixtures of cationic softener and paraffinic materials are proposed in a certain ratio which can allow the preparation of concentrated softening compositions when relatively high proportions of paraffinic materials are employed.Paraffins are not essential components of the compositions of the present invention and are preferably absent therefrom. Dutch Patent Application No. 6706178 relates to viscosity control in fabric softening compositions with up to 12 of cationic softener, and suggests the use of low molecular weight hydrocarbons for this purpose. British Patent No. 1,538,094, Hoechst, published January 17, 1979, discloses a complex softener disinfectant composition in which a long chain fatty alcohol used at a relatively low ratio of cationic softener to alcohol is suggested as a solubilization aid. European Patent Application 0013780, publishedAugust 6, 1980, discloses concentrated aqueous fabric softener compositions comprising a cationic softener and a viscosity control agent selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbons, fatty acids, fatty acid esters and fatty alcohols.European Patent Application 0018039, published October 29, 1980, discloses concentrated aqueous fabric softening compositions comprising an insoluble cationic softener, a water soluble nonionic or cationic surfactant and a hydrophobic adjunct selected from C12 to C20 paraffins and esters of C12 to C24 fatty acids and C1 to C8 fatty alcohols. Waterinsoluble fatty nonionic materials are not essential to the compositions herein and are preferably absent therefrom. The object of the present invention is to provide highly concentrated aqueous fabric softening compositions, based on cation softener systems, which do not require substantial quantities of materials other than the cationic softeners to ensure physical stability and acceptable viscosity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to highly concentrated aqueous liquid fabric softener compositions which comprise a mixture of specific types of cationic softeners and an ionizable salt, wherein the mixture of cationic softeners has an Iodine Value of at least about 4.2.

Hydrogenated tallow often has some residual degree of unsaturation such that theIodine Value of hydrogenated ditallowdimethyl ammonium salts can be up to about 5. Exemplary commercial quaternary ammonium salts which are suitable for use as Component A in the compositions herein are dihydrogenatedtallowdimethyl ammonium chloride sold under the name Adogen 442, and ditallowdimethyl ammonium chloride I.V. about 29 30 sold under the name Adogen 470, both from SherexChemical Company. The quaternary ammonium salts are used in the compositions herein at levels of from about 2 to about 11 , preferably from about 5 to about 10 . All percentages and proportions herein are by weight unless specified otherwise . The di 2 amidoethyl methyl quaternary ammonium salt of the invention herein has the structureEMI8.1 wherein R5 and R6 are the same or different from each other and are selected from the group consisting of C14 to C20 alkyl and alkenyl groups, wherein R7 is selected from H, methyl, ethyl and CnH2nO xH wherein n is 2 to 3 and x is from 1 to about 5 preferably 3 , and wherein X is an anion selected from halide, ethylsulfate or methylsulfate.

This class of compounds is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,134,840,Minegishi et al., issued January 16, 1979, incorporated herein by reference. Exemplary compounds are di 2 hydrogenatedtallowamidoethyl ethoxylated 2 ethoxy groups methyl ammonium methylsulfate, di 2 hydrogenatedtallowamido ethyl dimethyl ammonium ethylsulfate, di 2 palmitylamidoethyl hydromethyl ammonium chloride, di 2 oleylamidoethyl propoxylated 3 propoxy groups methyl ammonium bromide, di 2 palmitoleylamidoethyl dimethyl ammonium ethylsulfate and di 2 stearylamidoethyl propoxylated 2 propoxy groups methyl ammonium methylsulfate. Exemplary commercial materials suitable for use as Component B herein are di 2 hydrogenatedtallowamidoethyl ethoxylated methyl ammonium methyl sulfate sold under the name Varisoft 110, and di 2 tallowamidoethyl ethoxylated methyl ammonium methylsulfate I.V.about 31 sold under the name Varisoft 222, both fromSherex Chemical Company. Component C, which is present at a level of from about 2 to about 13 preferably from about 3 to about 108 of the compositions of the present invention is a cationic softener selected from a group consisting of three different types of imidazolinium salts. TheseComponent C materials are designated herein as C. 1 , C. 2 and C. 3 . Component C. 1 has the formula EMI10.1 wherein R8 and R9 are the same or different from each other and are selected from the group consisting of C14 to C20 alkyl and alkenyl groups, wherein X is halide, ethyl sulfate or methylsulfate.

Exemplary commercial materials are 1methyl l tallowamidoethyl 2 tallowimidazolinium methylsulfate I.V. about 42 sold under the name Varisoft 475, and 1 methyl 1 hydrogenatedtailowamidoethyl 2 hydrogenatedtallowimidazolinium methyl sulfate sold under the name Varisoft 445, both available from SherexChemical Company. Component C. 2 has the formula EMI10.2 mixture of alkenyl and alkyl groups such that the compound has an l.V. of from about 25 to about 125.Preferably Components A and B will be saturated compounds and the weight ratio of Component C to Components A B will be at least about 0.2 1 and the sum ofComponents A B C will be from about 15 to about 21 . An essential feature of the compositions herein is that the cationic active system in the composition has an Iodine Value I.V. of at least about 4.2, i.e., a substantial amount of unsaturation must be present. In accordance with the invention it has been found that high active compositions which are based on substantially water insoluble cationic softeners, such as those of the invention, cannot be made without having a substantial amount of unsaturation in the cationic active system. When using all saturated active systems, the compositions will gel and become unusable at room temperature and below. Preferably theI.V. is at least about 10.5 and is most preferably from about 10.5 to about 34. The unsaturation can come fromComponent A, B or C, or any combination thereof. I.V.is a direct measure of the unsaturation and is based upon the reaction of iodine with unsaturated bonds in a molecule. The I.V. is defined as the number of decigrams of iodine which will readt with one gram of the cationic active system. The standard technique for determiningI.V. is well known in the art. If one knows the I.V.of the individual components which are used in the active system, then the I.V. of the system can simply be calculated by multiplying the I.V. of each component by the percentage of that component in the composition and then dividing by the total percentage of components in the composition. For example, in a composition of the invention which contains 108 Component A, 5 Component B and 5 Component C, wherein Components A and B have I.V. s of 0 and Component C has an I.V. of 40, theI.V. of the cationic active system is 10 i.e., 5 x 40 20 . wherein R10 and R11 can be the same or differ ent from each other and are selected from the group consisting of C14 to C20 alkyl and alkenyl and X is halide, methylsulfate or ethyl sulfate. Exemplary compounds of this type are l ethylene bis 2 stearyl, l methyl, imidazolinium methylsulfate , l ethylene bis 2 oleyl, l methyl, imidazolinium methylsulfate and l ethylene bis 2 tallow, l methyl, imidazolinium methylsulfate . The tallow derivative, in hydrogenated or unhydrogenated form, is commercially available from Sherex Chemical Company under the name Varisoft 6112.The unhydrogenated material has an I.V. of about 29. Component C. 3 has the formula EMI12.1 wherein R12, R13, and R14 are the same or different from each other and are selected from the group consisting of C14 to C20 alkyl or alkenyl, wherein X is halide, methyl sulfate or ethylsulfate. Exemplary compounds of this type are methyl 2 stearyl 3 stearylamidoethyl stearylamino ethylenei imi dazolinium ethylsulfate, l methyl 2 oleyl 3 oleylamido ethyl oleylamino ethylene imidazolinium ethyl sulfate and l methyl 2 tallow 3Etallowamidoethyl tallowamino ethylene imidazolinium ethylsulfate. The tallow derivative I.V. about 32 is sold under the name Varisoft 3012 by the Sherex Chemical Company. Components C. 1 , C. 2 and C. 3 can be used singly or in mixtures with each other. Preferably Component C in the compositions herein is Component C. 1 , wherein R8 and Rg are a It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that not all possible combinations of Components A, B and C throughdut the total active level range of 15 to 22.5 will produce 400F pourable compositions throughout the range of I.V. s specified.Generally at the higher active levels, or at higher proportions of Component A in the system, higher I.V. s are required. Also, if the unsaturation comes fromComponent A, a higher I.V. will be required than if the same quantity of unsaturation comes from Component B orC. Generally higher cationic system I.V. s in the composition give a higher degree of pourability.However, excessively high I.V. s i.e., above about 40 should be avoided since these can result in gelling in some instances during the making process. Some formulation guidelines are given below.1. A minimum I.V. of 4.2 provides suitable 400F pourable compositions at 15 total cationic active when the ratio of Component A to Components B C is from about 0.2 to about 1.14. 2. A minimum I.V. of 6.2 provides suitable 400F pourable compositions at 18 total cationic active when the ratio of Component A to Components B C is from about 0.3 to about 1.25. 3. A minimum I.V. of 6.5 provides suitable 400F pourable compositions at 19 total cationic active when the ratio of Component A to Components B C is from about 0.4 to about 1.1. 4. A minimum I.V. of 6.4 provides suitable 400F pourable compositions at 20 total cationic active when Component A constitutes one fourth of the cationic active. 5. A minims I.V of 7.7 provides suitable 400F pourable compositions at 20 total cationic active when Component A constitutes 50 of the cationic active. 6. A minimum I.V. of 10.7 provides suitable 400F pourable compositions at 22.5 total cationic active when Component A constitutes 49 of the cationic active.

A wide wariety of ionizable salts can be used as Component D in the compositions herein. The particular salt should b. sufficiently soluble in the compositions to produce m concentration in solution of from about 500 to about 6000 ppm preferably about 500 to abut 4000 ppm and should not adversely inW ract with the fabric softener compounds. Examples of suitable salts are the halides of the Group 1A and 2A metals of the Periodic Table of Elements, e.g., sodium chloride, potassium bromide, lithium chloride, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride. The ionizable salts provide viscosity control, particularly during the process of mixing the ingredients to make the compositions herein. The water used in the compositions herein is preferably distilled or deionized water and is generally present at levels of from about 76 to 84 . Preferred compositions of the invention are those wherein Components A and B are substantially saturated and Component C is unsaturated and is of the type identified herein as C. 1 . These preferred compositions can be defined as follows A. from about 3.75 to about 10.58 preferably from about 5 to about 10 of a quaternary ammonium salt having the formulaEMI16.1 wherein R1 and R2 can be. the same or different from each other and are selected from the group consisting of C14 to C20 alkyl groups, R3 and R4 can be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of C1 to C3 alkyl groups and wherein X is halide B. from about 3.758 to about 10.5 preferably from about 5 to about 10 of a di 2 amido ethyl alkoxylated methyl quaternary ammonium salt having the formula EMI17.1 wherein H5 and R6 are the same or different from each other and are selected from the group consisting of C14 to C20 alkyl groups, wherein n is 2 or 3 and x is a number of from 1 to about 5 and wherein X is halide, ethyl sulfate or methylsulfate C. at least about 2.5 preferably from about 3 to about 10 , and most preferably from about 3.75 to about 5.25 of an imidazo linium salt having the formulaEMI17.2 wherein R7 and R8 are the same or different from each other and are selected from the group consisting of alkenyl groups or a mix ture of alkyl and alkenyl groups, each con twining from about 14 to about 20 carbon atoms, wherein X is halide, ethylsulfate or methylsulfate, and wherein said Component C has an Iodine Value of from about 25 to about 125, preferably from about 25 to about 45 D. from about 0.05 to about 0.4 of an inorganic rater soluble ionizable salt and Z. water the total amount of Components A B C in said composition being from about 15 to about 21 and the IodineValue of the total cationic system being at least about 4.2. Various optional materials such as are ordinarily used in fabric softening compositions can be used in the compositions herein. These include, for example, perfumes at 0 1 to 1.0 , antimicrobials at 0.01 to 0.1 and dyes at 0.001 to 0.01 . In general, it is conventional to include lower aliphatic alcohols such as ethanol and isopropanol in liquid fabric softener compositions in fact, the softening ingredients are normally sold to the formulator in the form of 70 to 90 pastes in which a lower alcohol is a diluent. It has been found that the compositions herein should preferably be substantially free of lower aliphatic alcohols, and that in any event these alcohols should not be present in said compositions at levels in excess of about 3 . If the softener ingredients are purchased as dispersions in amounts of alcohol which would produce alcohol levels in excess of about 3 in the finished compositions herein, some or all of the alcohol should be removed e.g., by heatassisted evaporation before use in preparing the compositions herein. Lower alcohols tend to cause viscosity increase during storage particularly at higher storage temperatures and if the alcohol is isopropanol, the odor imparted to the finished product.is undesirable. Agents which facilitate recovery of the compositions to a stable homogeneous liquid condition after having been subjected to freezing can be included in the compositions. Preferred freeze thaw recovery agents are the di polyetboxy monoalkyl amines of the formulaEMI18.1 wherein R19 is an alkyl or alkenyl group of from about 14 to 20 carbon atoms and the sum of m n is from about 10 to about 25. A preferred material is sold under the name Varonic T220 by Sherex Chemical Company wherein R19 is unhydrogenated tallow and the sum of m n is about 20. Freeze thaw agents are used in the compositions herein at levels of about 18. Care must be exercised in the preparation of the compositions herein. The order of addition and manner of mixing the components can have a significant effect on the physical characteristics of the composition. A particularly preferred method of preparation is as follows. Components A, B and C and dyes, if used are heated and blended together to form a melt at about 175 1850F, This melt is then added gradually to 1100F water with vigorous agitation. A portion of the ionizable salt is added to the water concurrently with the melted softeners at a rate necessary to keep the aqueous mix fluid and stirrable. Upon completion of the addition of the melted softeners, the remainder of the ionizable salt is added to produce the desired viscosity.Optional ingredients such as perfume, etc., are added after the viscosity of the mix has been reduced by the addition of most of the ionizable salt.After completion of the addition of ionizable salt the composition is cooled to room temperature before filling into containers. It is desirable that the compositions herein have a pH of from about 5.5 to about 6.5. Acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric or citric or bases such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate can be added, as needed, to the compositions to achieve the desired pH.Normally, only very small amounts of such pH adjusting agents are required. The invention will be further illustrated by the following example. EXAMPLE I This example illustrates the preparation of a 200 ib. batch of a composition of the present invention.Materials 23 libs. 87 active dihydrogenatedtallowdimethyl ammonium chloride DTDMAC 213.3 lbs 75 active di 2 hydrogenatedtallowamido ethyl ethoxylated methyl ammonium methyl sulfate Varisoft 110 311.1 lbs 90 active l methyl l unsaturatedtallow amidoethyl 2 unsaturate allowimidazolinium methylsulfate Varisoft 475, I.V. 42 1.2 lbs. 1.35 solution of Polar Brilliant Blue dye in water 960 ml 25 w v CaC12 in water 1.5 lbs. perfume 147 lbs. deionized water 120 g. 20 w v NaOH in water 1Contains 8 ethanol. 2Contains 12 isopropanol. 3Contains 10 isopropanol.Equipment 20 gallon capacity steam jacketed pre mix tank 60 gallon capacity main mix tank equipped with vertically mounted, variable speed 50 5a0 rpm mixer with impellerProcedure The pre mix tank was charged with the molten softener actives in the sequence DTDMAC, Varisoft 110, Vaisoft 475. The resulting mixture was heated with stirring to 1700F, at which time the dye solution was added. Heating of the mixture then continued until a temperature of 185OF was reached.The main mix tank was charged with 17.6 gal. 147 libs. of deionized water which was then heated to 110OF. The agitator was set at 150 rpm and the contents of the pre mix tank at 1850F were pumped into the main mix tank over a period of 5 minutes. During this 5 minute period the agitator speed. was gradually increased to 275 300 rpm as the main mix thickened. Also, beginning. at the point where about one half of the premix had been added, the CaC12 solution was added in portions see table below at such a rate as to maintain a stirrable, flowable mixture. As the viscosity decreased the agitator speed was gradually reduced back to 150 rpm.The 120 g. of 20 NaOH solution was added about 7 minutes after the start of addition of the active pre mix to the main mix tank. This solution of NaOH serves to adjust the final product pH to 6.0 and also reduces product viscosity. The perfume was added 20 minutes after the start of addition of the active pre mix to the main mix tank. Addition of Caul2 solution continued until the viscosity of the warm product was 140 cP.This required a final concentration of 2650 ppm 0.265t Caul2 . Upon cooling to room temperature the resulting 200 libs. of product had a viscosity of 95 cP.The following table records the chronology of Caul2 solution addition to the main mix tank and corresponding viscosity readings, where taken.

This composition exhibits excellent softening and antistatic performance and has excellent physical stability and pourability between 400F and 1000F. Another formula which exhibits comparable performance, physical stability and pourability is made as above except that the active system consists of 5 dihydrogenatedtallowdimethyl ammonium chlorid. 10 di 2 hydrogenatedtallowamidoethyl ethoxylated methyl ammonium methylsulfate and 5 l methyl l tallowamidoethyl 2 tallbwimidazolinium methyl sulfate Varisoft 475 . This formula also has an Iodine Value of 10.5 for the total cationic active system.
