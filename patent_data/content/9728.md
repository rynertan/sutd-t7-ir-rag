## Description
HEMOSTATIC AND PLATELET INCREASING AGENT CONTAINING i, ss DIAMINOPROPIONIC ACID AND DERIVATIVES THEREOF The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing as an active ingredient I diamino propionic acid or derivatives thereof. A process for preparing alpha , n diaminopropionic acid which comprises treating 2,3 dichlorpropionic acid with ammonia was reported in 1894 z. Phvsiol. Chem., vol. 19, page 314 1984 .Since then several reports on the preparation thereof were made, and, in addition, an effect of inhibiting growth of microorganisms was reported with respect to its salts Merck Index, 9th edition, page 391 1941 . As a result of extensive investigations on Dencichi Panax notoginseng E. H. Chen having hemostatic activity, the present inventors have found that L N B oxalyl 7, O diaminopropionic acid contained therein is a hemostatic active ingredient and at the same time exhibits platelet increasing activity.This compound was given a name of Dencichin by the present inventors. That is, L N 2 oxalyl 4, ss diaminopropionic acid provides a good hemostatic activity and platelet increasing activity by the use in an extremely small dosage and does not exhibit neurotoxic side effect which would be encountered by the use of a relatively large dose. In addition, D form of Dencichin also possesses pharmaceutical activities similar to naturally occurring L form.Further, the D form is slighter in neurotoxic activity than theL form. It has also been found that even L alpha ,ss diaminopropionic acid itself which is to be called as a parent substance of oxalyl alpha , 0 diaminopropionic acid exhibits hemostatic activity as well as platelet increasing activity, which activity being comparable with those of L N ss oxalyl alpha ,ss diaminopropionic acid, and provides toxicity further less than that of the oxalyl derivative by about 1 5. That is, a rate of shortening bleeding time hereafter referred to as shortened rate of the parent acid shows 44 , in contrast to 35 with the oxalyl form and its D form, respectively which is a marked hemostatic activity. In addition, L alpha diaminopropionic acid shows the increase of the number of platelet by about 17 in platelet increasing activity, as compared to a control. That is, an object of the present invention is to provide a hemostatic and platelet increasing agent comprising, alpha ,ss diamino propionic acid and derivatives thereof, represented by the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 each represents a hydrogen atom, an acyl group, a benzyl group or a substituted sulfonyl group, and pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts. The active ingredient of the present invention can shorten bleeding time as 6 to 10 times as rapid, as compared to transamine which is known as a hemostatic agent, as stated above. In particular, compounds of the formula wherein R1 and R2 each represents acetyl, oxalyl and benzyl provide extremely marked hemostatic activity. alpha , Diaminopropionic acid and derivatives thereof represented by the formula I are employed as active ingredients of hemostatic and platelet increasing agents as they are, or in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as, salts of salts of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or hydrobromic acid, or organic acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, etc. The hemostatic and platelet increasing agent containing the active ingredient of the present invention can be zu the form of conventional preparations such as internal use preparations, e.g., tablet, powders, capsule, etc., injections, or external use preparations, in a conventional manner, and thus can be orally or externally administered.The dosage generally varies depending upon symptom, manner of administration, etc., but generally is in a range of 1 to 2 mg. one time daily to achieve desired effects The hemostatic and platelet increasing agent of the present invention is effective not only for bleeding but also for treatment of diseases such as thrombopathy, throboasthenia, purpura naemorrhagica thrombopania, etc. Most of V e diaminopropionic acid and derivatives thereof represented by the formula I are known compounds sut some of which have not been recited in publication, These mew compounds are, e.g., D N ss oxalyl alpha , diaminopropionic acid, N alpha benzyl alpha ,ss diaminopropionic acid, etc. These alpha ,ss diamino propionic acid derivatives are generally synthesized using as a tarting material aspargic amide via the following reaction routes.EMI4.1 herein R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined above. In order to selectively introduce substituents at the alpha amino group, the amino group at the beta position is previously protected by conventional amino protective groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl and then desired groups are introduced at the alpha amino group in conventional manner, and the amino protective group is finally eliminated in conventional manner, for example, by stirring at room temperature together with 36 hydrobromic acid and acetic acid when benzyloxycarbonyl protective group is to be removed. These reactions are shown below, using as a representative substituent a benzyl group.EMI5.1 I the reaction scheme above, the route of I II III is shown below as synthesis examples the procedures for preparing I from , diaminopropionic acid are known . Synthesis Example 1 alpha Benzylamino ss benzyloxycarbonylaminopropionic acid I C Amino ss benzyloxycarbonylaminopropionic acid 2.6 g was diss lved in 2N NaOH aqueous solution. To the solution, 3 g. of A Benzaldehyde was added. After adding 300 mg. of NaBH4 to the mixture small by small at temperatures lower than 50C., the mixture was stirred for 2 hrs. The reaction liquid was extract with ether. The water soluble portion was rendered acidic with HC1 and the formed crystals were collected and recristallized from methanol water. I showing a melting point of 210 C was almost quantitatively obtained. Synthesis Example 2 alpha Benzylamino ss aminopropionic acid hydrobromide II A solution of 1 g. of II in 36 HBr and acetic acid was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hr. To the reaction liquid, 20 ml C dry ether was added and the formed powders ere collected and dissolved in methanol. After purifying with dry ether, II showing melting point of 1950C. was obtained in a good yield. Synthesis Example 3 alpha Benzylamino ss aminopropionic acid III solution of 500 mg. of II in a 5 LiOH aq. solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. Then water was removed by oistillation and the residue was dissolved in methanol. After purifying by adding ether thereto, III showing a melting point of 212 C was almost quantita tively obtained. Further details of synthesis and reaction conditions are described in Acta Chem. Scand., vol. 14, page 961 1960 , Chem.Communs., vol. 25, page 2022 1960 and J. Org. Chem. vol. 41, page 159 1976 , and the compounds of the formula I can be prepared in accordance with or by modifying the teachings of the articles above. The present invention will be described in more detail with reference to the examples below, in which hemostatic test was performed as follows Hemostatic Test Male mice weighing 15 to 20 g. were intraperitoneously given with 0.5 rill. of a Locke solution. The micevwere holded on a mouse holder 10 minutes after the administration, where the left vein of the tail at the middle of the tail 3 to 4 cm.from the root of the tail was wounded with a knife to bleed.A filter paper was softly touched with the incised wound at the interval of 30 seconds and observation was made if blood was transferred onto the filter paper. Time until blood was not transferred onto the filter paper was measured and was made bleeding time for control Subsequently, a test compound dissolved in 0.5 ml. or aLocke solution was intraperitoneously administered to the sane mice. The mice were holded onto a mouse holder 10 minutes after the administration. The right vein at the middle of the tail was wounded with a knife and a bleeding time was measured as in control described above. A difference in bleeding time between the control and the test compound was made a shortened time for bleed stopping. Example 1 To 100 g. of Denshichi Panax notoginseng E. H. chen. powders, 200 ml. of methanol was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. to facilitate extraction. Then the extract was centrifuged to separate the precipitate from the portion soluble in methanol. 200 ml. of methanol was added to the precipitate to perform extraction in the same manner as above.The extraction was performed three times. Thereafter, 300 ml. of water was added to the resulting precipitate and the mixture was extracted while stirring at room temperature for 1 hr. The extract was subjected to centrifuge. To the precipitate, 300 ml.of fresh water was added and extraction was repeated three times as described above. Respective water soluble portions were combined 5 mg. of the methanol soluble portions and water soluble portions were added to 0.5 ml. of a Lock solution, respectively. Using samples obtained by adding 5 mg. of the methanolsoluble substance and the water soluble substance to 0.5 ml. of a Locke solution, respectively, hemostatic test was performed in a manner described above. The results are shown in the table below. Table 1 Control Time until Bleed Shortened Time min. ing stops min. for Bleed S.o ping min.
