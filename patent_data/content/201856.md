# Catalyst for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons and process for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons using said catalyst.

## Abstract
A catalyst for production of aromatic hydrocarbons and a process for producing aromatic hydrocarbons from various hydrocarbons using said catalyst are disclosed. The catalyst comprises a L type zeolite treated with a halogen containing compound and platinum deposited thereon, which is of high activity and has a long service life. The process of the present invention using the catalyst enables to produce aromatic hyd rocarbons in a yield as high as not less than 80 for a long time. The hydrocarbon feedstock is selected from paraffin, olefin, acetylene, cyclic paraffin, and cyclic olefin based hyd rocarbons.
