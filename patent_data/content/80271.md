## Description
INDOMETHACIN PHENYL ESTER DERIVATIVES, THEIR USE, AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM The present invention relates to indomethacin phenyl ester derivatives, their use, and compositions containing them. Indomethacin is well known as an anti inflammatory agent, but its use is limited by its tendency to cause ulcers. Various indomethacin derivatives are known, including 2 hydroxycarbonylphenyl 1 p chlorobenzoyl 5 methoxy 2 methylindole 3 acetate. Ceskos lovenska Farmacie 26 1977 6277 reports that this compound is not useful, because of its hydrolysis by serum esterase. According to the present invention, compounds for pharmaceutical, and particularly anti inflammatory, use, have the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R is hydrogen, lower e.g. C18 alkyl, aralkyl or substituted phenyl. The compounds of formula I in which R is alkyl, aralkyl or substituted phenyl are novel compounds of the invention. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises a compound of formula I in association with a physiologically acceptable excipient. The compounds of the invention can have good anti inflammatory activity in vivo, but without the undesirable side effects associated with indomethacin.In particular, the known indomethacin ester described above shows high ulceration inhibition. Compounds of formula I may be prepared by reacting indomethacin, or a reactive derivative thereof, in a suitable solvent, with an appropriate hydroxybenzoate. If desired, a condensation agent may be present.Again, if desired, the product may be subjected to hydrogenolysis. Suitable reactive derivatives of indomethacin include acid halides and activated esters thereof.Examples of suitable hydroxybenzoates are the lower alkyl, e.g. methyl, ethyl or t butyl, esters, aralkyl, e.g. benzyl, phenethyl or anisyl, esters, and substituted phenyl, e.g. benzyloxycarbonylphenyl, esters such as hydroxybenzoyloxybenzoic acid. It is preferred that the product should have the COOR group at the ortho position relative to the indomethacin radical. If the reaction involves the use of an indomethacin acid halide, it is preferred that an amine is also used, in order to neutralise the hydrogen halide which is produced. Suitable amines are tertiary amines such as triethylamine, pyridine and dimethylaniline. The products of the invention may exist in crystalline form. For use, they may be compounded into compositions comprising conventional excipients which are preferably solids or sterile liquids. Such compositions may be provided in unit dosage, i.e.discrete, form. The compound may comprise a minor proportion of the composition, with the excipient which may comprise a mixture of components constituting the major proportion, by weight.
