# Vascular graft prosthesis.

## Abstract
A porous tube 1 suitable for use as a vascular graft prosthesis is disclosed. It is reinforced by external ribs 4 , integral with the tube wall 6 . These ribs are generally transverse to the tube axis and less porous than the wall. Suitable tubing can be made from polymers exhibiting a significant degree of crystallinity, preferably polytetra fluoroethylene. Methods for making these ribbed, porous tubes are also disclosed.
