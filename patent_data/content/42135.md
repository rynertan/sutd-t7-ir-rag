# Process for reducing the hydroxyl group content in preforms for optical fibres manufactured by MCVD process.

## Abstract
Process for reducing hydroxyl group content in pre forms for optical fibres, manufactured by MCVD process, consisting of isotopic exchange between hydrogen and deuterium near the internal walls of the silica glass sup porting tube 8 . The operation is carried out in two steps, first by inducing deuterium adsorption and then by termally activating the exchange reaction.
