# SYSTEM FOR DIAPHRAGM DISTILLATION

## Abstract
A system for diaphragm distillation of a liquid, for exam ple for desalination of salt water, comprising a diaphragm, through which vapour, but not liquid can pass, and a con densation surface for condensing vapour having passed through the diaphragm, and necessary passageways. Ac cording to the invention, the system comprises one or several units, each of which comprises a plurality of pipes located one within the other, viz. a first 1 inner pipe, a second 2 pipe located outside thereof and consisting of a diaphragm of the aforesaid kind, and a third 3 pipe located outside the second 2 pipe, which first 1 and third 3 pipes are of a gas tight material, that said unit is surrounded by a fourth 4 gas tight pipe, where a first 5 passageway is formed by the first 1 pipe and a second 6 , a third 7 and a fourth 8 passageway are formed between said pipes 1, 2 2, 3 3, 4 in successive order in the direction from the inside outward. The said passageways 5, 6,7, 8 in radial order are intended to transport a warm medium WW for the supply of heat, to transport the liquid SW to be distilled, to condense gas having passed through the diaphragm 2 and to trans port distillate PW which has been condensed, where the condensation of the gas takes place against a condensation surface, which consists of the passageway surface opposite to the diaphragm 2 , and, respectively, to transport a cold in medium CW for heat removal.
