# Knitted surgical swabs.

## Abstract
A surgical swab comprises a warp knitted body portion 1 and an integrally warp knitted handling tape 3 . Both the body portion and the handling tape are formed as two superimposed layers on a twin needle bed knitting machine, the respective longitudinal and or laterally extending edges of each layer being joined by interknitting. The swab may be cut from a continuous swab strip which is formed by continuously knitting a lnegth of body portion fabric and of handling tape fabric with a lateral band of the fabrics being knitted together at intervals. Individual swabs are separated from the strip by cutting through the lateral band.
