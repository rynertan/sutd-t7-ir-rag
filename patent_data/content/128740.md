# Pressure regulator.

## Abstract
Pressure in chamber 16 is regulated by modulating the supply flow through the orifice 48. Solenoid 51 when ener gized withdraws the plunger 55 to the broken line position, thus increasing the flow rate and the pressure in chamber 16. A sequence of square pulses of controllable width is supplied to energize the solenoid and the mark space ratio of the pulses determines the mean pressure in the chamber.
