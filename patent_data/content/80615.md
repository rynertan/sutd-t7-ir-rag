# Process for synthesizing zeolites having a mordenite structure and a high catalytic activity.

## Abstract
A process for synthetizing mordenites having a high catalytic activity, in which the SiO₂ Al₂O₃ molar ratio ranges from 16 to 40, said process comprising the step of mixing an organic base with H₂O and with at least a Na compound, an Al compound, and a Si compound, wherein said base is a diethyl piperidinium compound and wherein the crystalliza tion temperature of mordenite and the SP factor are selected within area A B C D of figure 1, the crystallization time being longer than two days.
