# A NOVEL THERMOSTABLE GLUCOAMYLASE AND METHOD FOR ITS PRODUCTION

## Abstract
This invention relates to a glucoamylase enzyme exhibit ing thermostability at pH values between 6 and 7 which is derived from a spore forming, thermophilic, anaerobic bac terium and to a process for its production. The glucoamylase is especially useful for the preparation of glucose containing syrups from starch.
