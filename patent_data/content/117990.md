# Apparatus for matched impedance feeding of microstrip type radio frequency antenna structure.

## Abstract
The center region of a dual slot microstrip type antenna radiator patch structure 12 is forced to take on a controlled non zero radio frequency impedance by the provision of a slot 20 formed therein at the center region. By controlling the dimension of such an impedance matching slot in the radiator patch, a feedpoint connection 18 may be made at the center region of the radiator patch and still achieve matched impedance feed. Because the feedpoint can thus be centrally located within the antenna structure, any spurious radiation which occurs from the feedpoint connection or associated feedlines does not tend to skew the overall or composite radiation antenna of the pattern as much as when such feedpoints are asymmetrically disposed on the radiator patch with respect to the primary radiating apertures.
