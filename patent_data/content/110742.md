# Disc brake thrust collar assembly.

## Abstract
A disk brake is actuated through a mechanical linkage comprising a power screw 54 which is rotatably mounted within the housing 22 and a piston or power nut 38 which is threadedly engaged with the power screw 54 and which also is engaged with the friction element 32 . An annular thrust collar 70 is installed within the housing 22 and de fines a thrust receiving surface 73 which faces a surface 62 on the power screw 54 . Brake reaction forces are transmitted to the wall of the housing 22 without loading the bolts 86 in tension by way of the surfaces 62, 73 of the thrust collar 70 , the surface 108 and the retaining ring 66 . A take up ring 84 made of a deformable material is carried in the groove 82 of the thrust collar 70 so that, when a brake is manufac tured, the thrust collar 70 is first installed in the bore and the retaining ring 66 is then installed in the groove 64 . When the brake is first applied, the reaction forces drive the collar 70 into the position illustrated in the drawings, thereby deforming the take up ring 84 to pass under the retaining ring 66 . The take up ring 84 thereafter assumes its original shape to en gage the retaining ring 66 to hold the thrust collar 70 in place. An alternate embodiment discloses an equivalent hy draulic actuator, in which the power screw is replaced by a hy draulic coupling.
