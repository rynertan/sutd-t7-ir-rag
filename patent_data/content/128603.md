## Description
Transistor transistor logic circuit with switchable current feedback. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the invention This invention is in the field of transistortransistor logic T L circuits suitable for use in semiconductor integrated circuit devices, and relates more particularly to a transistor transistor logic TêL circuit which comprises input circuit means comprising a phase splitter and having an input terminal, an in phase output node, and an inverting output node pull down output means having an input node coupled to the in phase output node of said phase splitter, an output node, and a common terminal coupled to ground pull up output means comprising a Darlington amplifier having an input node coupled to the inverting output node of said phase splitter, an intermediate node, a common node coupled to said power supply terminal, and an output terminal coupled to the pull down output node.Description of the Prior Art Logic circuits of the general transistor transistor logic TêL type are well known in the art. A basic T L circuit, and a description of its operation, can be found on page 312 of the standard reference text Analysis and Design of Integrated Circuits Motorola series in solid state electronics , McGraw Hill, 1967. Such circuits employ a phase splitter transistor with a Darlington pullup output amplifier having its input connected to the collector zone of the phase splitter transistor and a pulldown transistor having its input connected to the emitter zone of the phase splitter transistor. The Darlington pull up amplifier and the pull down transistor outputs are connected together to form the circuit output terminal. Such circuits have been widely used for several reasons, including their ability to drive heavy loads in either state, and in particular their ability to drive large capacitive loads. 2 However, the basis T L circuit suffers from a disadvantage in that the high to low or negative going transition at the output terminal may be somewhat slower than is desired, particularly for large capacitive loads.Since one of the main advantages of the T2L configuration 9 is its ability to drive such large capacitive loads, a T L circuit in which this high to low transition is enhanced would be particularly desirable. Accordingly, several modifications to the basic 9 T L circuit have been developed to improve this output level transition. For example, one well known expedient used, for example, in several Texas Instruments T2L devices has been to add a diode connected from the output terminal of the circuit to the collector zone of the phase splitter transistor in order to couple back a portion of the output signal through the phase splitter transistor to the base zone of the pull down transistor in order to speed up the turn on time of the latter transistor. As a result, the output signal is pulled to ground more rapidly, particularly when driving a large capacitive load. Another prior art feedback technique for improving the negative going output transition in a TêL circuit is shown in Japanese Kokai No. 56 25831, in which a diode and a feedback transistor are connected in series between the output terminal of the circuit and the base zone of the pull down transistor. The base zone of the feedback transistor is connected to the base zone of the phasesplitter transistor, so that the base emitter junctions of the phase splitter and feedback transistors are connected in parallel. In this manner a portion of the output signal current is fed back directly to the base of the pull down transistor as it is turning on to effect a more rapid change in state. However, both of these prior art circuits suffer from a significant drawback, In both cases, the prior art circuits provide a feedback path which remains undirectionally conductive either continuously for the simple diode circuit or at least for the entire time the circuit is in the low output state as in the Japanese reference .As a result, it is possible for an externally generated back current, such as a reflected load current or a D.C.forcing signal on the output, to drive a high current level back drom the output terminal to the base emitter junction of the pull down transistor. This increased base drive to the pull down transistor, at a time when a heavy current drive is also provided to the collector terminal of this transistor, may result in excessive current flow through the transistor, possibly causing a malfunction or permanently damaging the pull down transistor or its as sociated metal lines. Additionally, when these prior artT2L circuits are operated in combination with other circuitry using a higher power supply voltage, it is possible to have unwanted current pumping back into the T2 L circuit and its power supply from the external higher voltage power supply. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide aT2L circuit with a feedback circuit for improved negativegoing output transition characteristics while at the same time protecting the device against unwanted reflected load current or current pumping which may damage the device or impede its operation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a T2 L circuit which employs a feedback network for an improved high to low output transition, in particular for high capacitive loads, while at the same time affording protection against the unwanted injection of reflected or pumped current back into the circuit. A further object of the invention is to provide such a self protecting T2L circuit in which the negative going output transition time is equal to or better than that of prior art circuits without this self protecting feature. In accordance with the invention, these objects are achieved by an improved T2L circuit of the type described above characterized in that switchable feedback means are provided for selectably coupling the output terminal of the circuit to the inverting output node of thg phase splitter and comprising a control node connected to the intermediate node of the Darlington amplifier for switching said feedback means. This switchable feedback netwotk includes a diode connected in series with the collector emitter path of a feedback transistor, with the base zone of this transistor forming the control node of the feedback network.By connecting this control node to the intermediate node of the Darlington amplifier the connection point between the emitter zone of the inputDarlington transistor and the base zone of the outputDarlington transistor an active switchable feedback network is obtained which is activated only during the negative going output transition when feedback is desired, and which is rendered passive during the remainder of the operating cycle to prevent unwanted and potentially damaging current feedback. The invention may be more completely understood with reference to the following description of the prefer red embodiment, to be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The single FIGURE is a schematic diagram of a T2L circuit in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT A preferred embodiment of an improved T2L circuit in accordance with the invention is shown in the single Figure of the drawing. An input signal V. is applied to in an input terminal 1 which is connected to the base zone of a phase splitter transistor Q1. The collector zone of this transistor, which forms an inverting output node 4 of the phase splitter, is connected through a resistor R1 to a power supply terminal 2 Vcc . The emitter zone of Q1, which forms an in phase output node 5 of the phase splitter is connected to ground through a resistor R2 and a Schottky diode D1. The collector zone of transistor Q1 is also connected to the base zone of Schottky transistor Q2, with the collector zone of this transistor being connected to power supply terminal 2 through a resistor R3. The emitter zone of transistor Q2 is connected to the base zone of transistor Q3 at an intermediate node 6, and the collector zone of transistor Q3 is connected to the collector of transistor Q2. Together, transistors Q2 and Q3 form the first and second transistors, respectively, of a Darlington pull up amplifier. The emitter zone of transistor Q3 is connected to terminal 3 Vout , which is the circuit output terminal, and a bleeder resistor R4 is connected from the base zone of transistor Q3 to ground. The emitter zone of Schottky transistor Q1, which forms the in phase output node 5 of the phase splitter, is also connected to the base zone of Schottky pull down transistor Q4, while the emitter zone of the pull down transistor is connected to ground and its collector zone is connected to output terminal 3. The circuit as so faI described forms a l Schottky T2 L circuit representative of the f pe used in semiconductor integrated circuits. It should be recognized that many minor variations in this basic T2L circuit Such as the use of a transistor in the bypass network, shown in the Figure as a simple series connection of resistor R2 and diode D1, or the elmination of collector resistor R3 are possible, but that such minor variations do not affect the operation of the invention, which has general applicability in T2L circuits. The improved performance of the invention is attributable to a switchable feedback network for selectably coupling the output terminal 3 to the inverting output node 4 of the phase splitter transistor, at the collector of Q1. This switchable feedback network includes a Schottly diode D2 having its anode connected to the output terminal 3, and a transistor Q5 with its collector zone connected to the cathode of diode D2, its base zone connected to intermediate node 6 of the Darlington amplifier, and its emitter zone connected to the xr ring node 4 of the phase splitter transistor Q1. The switchable feedback network composed of tran sistor Q5 and diode D2 is controlled by the application of a signal from intermediate node 6 of the Darlington ampli fier to the base zone of Q5, with a feedback path from the output terminal 3 to the inverting node 4 being formed when transistor Q5 is turned on , and being opened when this transistor is turned off . The operation of the basic T2L circuit is well known in the art, and is described on pages 312 313 of the Motorola reference text mentioned above. Accordingly, the operational description of the present circuit will be primarily directed to a description of the switchable feedback network of the invention. As mentioned above, a feedback network in a TêL circuit should ideally provide the desired feedback during the high to low transition of the output stage to speed up this transition, while preventing unwanted and possibly damaging current feedback during other portions of the operating cycle. In order to accomplish both of these results, the present invention utilizes switching transistor Q5 in a unique configuration. By connecting the base zone of transistor Q5 to the inter mediate node 6 of the Darlington amplifier and the emitter zone of transistor Q5 to the inverting node 4 at the col lector of Q1, transistor Q5 will be turned off in both steady state output condition of the T2L circuit. In the high output state, transistors Q2 and Q3 are on , so that the base zone of transistor Q5 connected to the emitter of transistor Q2 will be at a sligtly lower po tential than that of the emitter zone of transistor Q5, which is connected to the base zone of transistor Q2, so that transistor Q5 is fully off .In the low output state, transistors Q2 and Q3 are off , so that intermediate node 6 of the Darlington amplifier will be at substantially ground potential due to bleeder resistor R4, while the emitter zone of transistor Q5 at inverting node 4 will be above ground by a voltage equal to the collectoremitter saturation voltage of transistor Q1 plus the baseemitter voltage of transistor Q4, since both of these latter transistors are on when the output is low .Thus, the feedback network is rendered non conductive during both steady state operating conditions of the circuit. In this manner, unwanted and potentially damaging current feedback during steady state operation is prevented. However, during the negative going switching transition of the output level, a unique transient condition exists which permits feedback transistor Q5 to be activated at precisely the right time to provide the desired feedback to speed up the negative going transition. In order to more fully understand the operation of the circuit of the invention, this transient condition will now be d3scribed in further detail. In the high output state, transistors Q2 and Q3 are on , while transistors Q1 and Q4 are off . Thus, nodes 3, 4 and 6 are all high , while node 5 is low . In this steady state condition, transistor Q5 is off , as previously described because its emitter zone is at a slightly higher potential than its base zone. When a positive going input signal V. in is applied to input terminal 1, phase splitter Q1 is turned on , causing node 4 to go low . This change in voltage level at node 4, which is also the input node of Darlington amplifier Q2, Q3, will subsequently cause the Darlington transistors to switch off . However, transistorQ2 will not switch off until some finite time after transistor Q1 has turned on , thus permitting the voltage at node 6 to remain high after the voltage at node 4 begins dropping. Additionally, the voltage at node 6 will remain high for an interval after both Darlington tran sistors are turned off , because of the stored charge remaining on the base of transistor Q3.By making resistorR4 suitably large, for example in the range of about 10,000 ohms or greater, this stored base charge will be discharged to node 4 primarily through the base emitter junction of transistor Q5. Thus, at the negative going output transition, transistor Q5 is initially turned on by a positive voltage on node 6 with respect to node 4, and is maintained in the on condition until the stored base charge of transistor Q3 is discharged through the base emitter junction of transistor Q5 to node 4. At this point transistor Q5 will return to the off state, where it will remain until the next negative going output transition.Transistor Q5 is not turned on during the positive going output transition, however, because transistor Q1 turns off thus raising the emitter voltage of Q5 at node 4 before transistor Q2 goes on to raise the base voltage of transistor Q5 at node 6. Thus, by advantageously employing the inherent switching delays and base charge storage characteristics of the T2L circuit, the present invention provides a simple and yet effective way of speeding up the negativegoing output transition without risking the danger of unwanted and possibly dangerous current feedback from outside the circuit during other portions of the operating cycle. An additional advantage of the present invention, confirmed by computerized circuit simulation, is that the negative going switching time is somewhat faster than for the simple prior art diode feedback circuit. This is believed to be because current feedback from node 6 and through the base emitter junction of transistor Q5 will begin slightly sooner than current feedback from output node 3 and thorugh diode D2 because, at the start of the negative going transition, node 6 is at a higher potential than node 3. Methods for manufacturing the various elements of the present T2L circuit are well known in the semiconductc art, and the circuit of the invention may be manufactured as a monolithic integrated circuit using conventional processing technology. While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
