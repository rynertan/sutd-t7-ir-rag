## Description
This invention relates to the preparation of new strains of a toxin producing bacterium having entomocidal activity, a new strain thereby produced and the use of this bacterium to protect plants susceptible to certain pests. More particularly, this invention relates to a new strain of Many plants of commercial and or domestic importance are subject to invasion and damage by lepidopterous pests. These pests are found throughout the world and currently their control requires repeated and costly application of the pesticides which are available. Many crops are susceptible to a number of lepidopterous pests. Among the most significant pests are the cotton leafworm Broad spectrum pesticides are a useful and valuable tool for crop protection, but the indiscriminate use of broad spectrum chemical insecticides can disrupt many natural control agents. Since most chemical insecticides are relatively non selective, they may destroy non target organisms, including beneficial predators and parasites of destructive pests. Some insects also develop resistance to chemical insecticides, which often makes them uncontrollable by these insecticides and may permit minor pests to become major ones. The introduction of selective microbial insecticides using naturally occurring bacteria as the active and host specific ingredient has helped to overcome many of these problems. An example of a microbial insecticide is These strains may be employed without ill effect on beneficial insects. Thus, the principal effect is due to the crystal which acts only after its dissolution in the intestines of the larvae. The activation of the crystal is caused by a combination of alkaline pH and proteolytic enzymes in the gut contents. The reaction is dependent on the high gut pH of lepidopterous larvae pH 7 , which allows the release of the toxic components of the crystal. These toxins break down the mid gut wall causing feeding to stop. The growth of bacteria thus released into the abdominal cavity results in septicaemia which also may play a part in the death of the insect. It is clear that the use of For this reason new strains having improved insecticidal activity, either in terms of greater toxicity for given species or in terms of a broader spectrum of activity, are currently being sought. However, the combination of high toxicity and broad spectrum of activity has in practice been very difficult to achieve. It has now been found that a new strain of Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel strain of This new strain effectively combines the potential entomocidal activities of two strains of The novel strain has an improved entomocidal activity against lepidopterous pests in the genera The invention also provides a process for producing a strain of Preferably, the first starting strain is strain HD 135 and the mutant produced in step a is strain 135 S4 NCTC 11822 . Preferably, the second starting strain is strain HD 191 and the asporogenic mutant is strain 191 A2 NCTC 11823 . The invention further provides a process for producing In an embodiment of this process, strains 191 A2 and 135 S4 are grown together in mixed culture to effect conjugation like plasmid transfer, the mixed culture is diluted and transferred to a solid medium to obtain single colonies, colonies of strain GC 91 are selected by the increased size of the parasporal crystal and the strain GC 91 is cultured therefrom. The invention also provides an entomocidal substance derived from The invention further provides an entomocidal composition comprising The invention in addition provides a method of combatting lepidopterous pests which comprises applying to the pests or to their environment an entomocidally effective amount of The strain of It is compatible with most other commonly used agricultural spray materials but should not be used in extremely alkaline spray solutions. It may be administered as a dust, a suspension, a wettable powder or in any other material form suitable for agricultural application. During production by fermentation, after normal growth of A method for preparing an insecticidal composition according to the invention comprises culturing the The spore crystal complex or the composition containing it may be administered to the plants or crops to be protected together with certain other insecticides or chemicals without loss of potency. It is possible to kill the spores in the spore crystal complex, for example by gamma radiation or some other method which does not damage the crystal, or to avoid producing spores by use of an asporogenous crystaliferous mutant, thereby producing in non viable product. A non viable product may be advantageous in certain circumstances where it is desired to prevent the spread of bacteria for aesthetic reasons or to avoid causing disease in beneficial lepidoptera, e.g. silkworms. However, non viable products are generally not as active as those containing live spores, and as a further disadvantage there is the increased cost of killing the spores. The invention furthermore relates to a method of treating plants, which comprises applying an entomocidally effective amount of Target crops to be protected within the scope of the present invention comprise e.g. the following species of plants The formulations, i.e. the compositions, preparations or mixtures containing Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably the fractions containing 8 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. xylene mixtures or substituted naphthalenes, phthalates such as dibutyl phthalate or dioctyl phthalate, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, alcohols and glycols and their ethers and esters, such as ethanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide or dimethylformamide, as well as vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils such as epoxidised coconut oil or soybean oil or water. The solid carriers used e.g. for dusts and dispersible powders, are normally natural mineral fillers such as calcite, talcum, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. In order to improve the physical properties it is also possible to add highly dispersed silicic acid or highly dispersed absorbent polymers. Suitable granulated adsorptive carriers are porous types, for example pumice, broken brick, sepiolite or bentonite and suitable nonsorbent carriers are materials such as calcite or sand. In addition, a great number of pregranulated materials of inorganic or organic nature can be used, e.g. especially dolomite or pulverised plant residues. Depending on the nature of the active ingredients to be formulated, suitable surface active compounds are non ionic, cationic and or anionic surfactants having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. The term surfactants will also be understood as comprising mixtures of surfactants. Suitable anionic surfactants can be both water soluble soaps and water soluble synthetic surface active compounds. Suitable soaps are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids C₁₀ C₂₂ , e.g. the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures which can be obtained, e.g. from coconut oil or tallow oil. Further suitable surfactants are also the fatty acid methyltaurin salts as well as modified and unmodified phospholipids. More frequently, however, so called synthetic surfactants are used, especially fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alkylaryl sulfonates. The fatty sulfonates or sulfates are usually in the forms of alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts and generally contain a C₈ C₂₂ alkyl radical which also includes the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals, e.g. the sodium or calcium salt of lignosulfonic acid, of dodecylsulfate, or of a mixture of fatty alcohol sulfates obtained from natural fatty acids. These compounds also comprise the salts of sulfuric acid esters and sulfonic acids of fatty alcohol ethylene oxide adducts. The sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain 2 sulfonic acid groups and one fatty acid radical containing about 8 to 22 carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl arylsulfonates are the sodium, calcium or triethanolamine salts of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, or of a naphthalenesulfonic acid formaldehyde condensation product. Also suitable are corresponding phosphates, e.g. salts of the phosphoric acid ester of an adduct of p nonylphenol with 4 to 14 moles of ethylene oxide. Non ionic surfactants are preferably polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, or saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, said derivatives containing 3 to 30 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the alkylphenols. Further suitable non ionic surfactants are the water soluble adducts of polyethylene oxide with polypropylene glycol, ethylenediaminopolypropylene glycol and alkylpolypropylene glycol containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, which adducts contain 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether groups and 10 to 100 propylene glycol ether groups. These compounds usually contain 1 to 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit. Representative examples of non ionic surfactants are nonylphenolpolyethoxyethanols, castor oil polyglycol ethers, polypropylene polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate, are also suitable non ionic surfactants. Cationic surfactants are preferably quaternary ammonium salts which contain, as N substituent, at least one C₈ C₂₂ alkyl radical and, as further substituents, lower unsubstituted or halogenated alkyl, benzyl or hydroxyl lower alkyl radicals. The salts are preferably in the form of halides, methylsulfates or ethylsulfates, e.g. stearyltrimethylammonium chloride or benzyldi 2 chloroethyl ethylammonium bromide. The surfactants customarily employed in the art of formulation are described e.g. in McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp. Ridgewood, New Jersey, 1979 Dr. Helmut Stache, Tensid Taschenbuch Handbook of Surfactants , Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich Vienna. The entomocidal compositions usually contain 0.1 to 99 , preferably 0.1 to 95 , of Whereas commercial products are preferably formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations of substantially lower concentration. The compositions may also contain further ingredients, such as stabilisers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders, tackifiers as well as fertilisers or other active ingredients in order to obtain special effects. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawing which shows plasmid profiles of wild type, mutant donor, mutant recipient and recombinant strain GC 91. The bracket indicates the position of the chromosomal DNA. The new strain of The starting strain was a wild type, H serotype 7, var Strain HD 135 showed entomocidal activity to Strain HD 135 was grown in Nutrient Broth Oxoid Ltd, U.K. Composition Lab Lemco Powder 1.0 g l, yeast extract L 20 2.0 g l, Peptone L 37 5.0 g l, NaCl 5.0 g l for 16 hours at 42 C. The culture was then diluted in 0.8 W V bactopeptone Difco and plated onto Nutrient agar Oxoid Ltd, U.K. Composition as Nutrient Broth, but with addition of Agar No. 3 15.0 g l to achieve approximately 100 colonies per plate. Incubation was then carried out for 48 hours at 30 C. Individual colonies were microscopically examined and one colony was found to produce parasporal crystals of reduced size. This colony was found to be a mutant strain of HD 135 and was designated 135 S4. Strain 135 S4 has been deposited at NCTC under the accession number NCTC 11822, deposited on 7th September 1984. Analysis of the plasmids in the mutant 135 S4 by the method of Jarret, P. 1983 , FEMS Microbiology Letters 16, pp. 55 60 showed it to be lacking a 53 Md plasmid and an 8.8 Md plasmid which were present in the parent strain see drawing . Electrophoresis on SDS sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gels of solubilized crystal protein from the wild type, HD 135, and 135 S4 showed that the parasporal crystals of 135 S4 lacked a polypeptide of Mr 130K. The methods used to purify crystals, dissolve them and run them on SDS polyacrylamide gels are known in the art and described, for example, by P. Jarrett, Journal of Applied Bacteriology 1985, Activities of the bacterial strain to Activities of bacterial strains to For The entomocidal activity of strain 135 S4 to a number of lepidopterous pests is shown in Table 1. A second mutant strain, coded 191 A2, was derived from a wild type H serotype Strain HD 191 was streaked onto the surface of Nutrient agar composition of media No difference between the parent and the mutant strain was detected when plasmid profiles of the two were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis see drawing . This indicated that the plasmid profile for entomocidal activity was probably the same as that of the spore producing parent HD 191, i.e. entomocidal activity against Using the conjugation like plasmid transfer system reported by Gonzalez, J.M. Jr., Brown, B.J. and Carlton, B.C. 1982 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol 79, pp 6951 55 with the following variation , the mutant strain 191 A2 was tested to identify which plasmid was responsible for toxin production. The donor 191 A2 and the recipient strain, an acrystaliferous mutant derived from the After heating, the culture was diluted and plated onto Nutrient agar to obtain individual colonies. After incubation for 48 hours at 30 C, colonies were microscopically examined to look for the presence of delta endotoxin crystals. The percentage of colonies producing crystals in four separate experiments were 59 , 41 , 22 and 31 . The plasmid profiles from recipients regaining crystal production showed that crystal synthesis was accompanied by the transfer of a 50 Md plasmid from the donor 191 A2. Twenty individual colonies were examined and all contained the 50 Md plasmid. Recipients receiving the 50 Md plasmid from 191 A2 showed the full biological activity of the donor wild type parent HD 191. The results are shown in Table 2. From this data it was concluded that a 50 Md plasmid coded for delta endotoxin crystal synthesis in 191 A2. Using the above method of plasmid transfer and selection of heat resistant, spore forming recipients, the 50 Md plasmid from 191 A2 was transferred into the mutant 135 S4. Individual colonies of 135 S4, possibly containing the 50 Md plasmid, colonies were microscopically examined to select for those producing crystals of increased size. The percentage of 135 S4 colonies producing crystals of increased size after plasmid transfer in two separate experiments was 29 and 21 . Plasmid profiles of such colonies showed the presence of a 50 Md plasmid in all 10 large crystal producing colonies analysed. It was concluded that uptake of the 50 Md plasmid resulted in an increase in the size of the parasporal crystal and concomitant alteration and increase in the entomocidal activity of the mutant 135 S4. The combined entomocidal acitvity was improved in respect of the pest species Mutant 135 S4 containing the additional 50 Md plasmid was designated as mutant GC 91. The entomocidal activities of strain GC91 and of other strains of Reference is also made to the accompanying drawing which shows plasmid profiles of the wild type, mutant donor, mutant recipient and recombinant strain GC91. The bracket indicates the position of the chromosomal DNA. throughout, percentages are by weight Emulsions of any required concentration can be obtained from this concentrate by dilution with water. Ready for use dusts are obtained by mixing the active ingredient with the carriers, and grinding the mixture in a suitable mill. The active ingredient or combination is mixed and ground with the adjuvants, and the mixture is subsequently moistened with water. The mixture is extruded, granulated and then dried in a stream of air. The finely ground active ingredient or combination is uniformly applied, in a mixer, to the kaolin moistened with polyethylene glycol. Non dusty coated granulates are obtained in this manner. The finely ground active ingredient or combination is intimately mixed with the adjuvants, giving a suspension concentrate from which suspensions of any desired concentration can be obtained by dilution with water. The novel strains of Suitable rates of application are 0.3 to 4.0 preferably 1.5 to 3.0 litres hectare for liquid concentrates, and 0.3 to 4.0 preferably 1.5 to 3.0 kg hectare for powder formulations.
