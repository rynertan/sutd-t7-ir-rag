# COATING COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Coating or binding agent to be used for paints, adhesives etc. and for coating molds, ceramic and metallic articles, above all ceramic substrates for I.C., having practically sufficient storage stability and being able to form transparent and hard film on substratum surface readily by drying and provide calcinated film without causing any cracking. Such composition is obtained by reacting an organic silica of 5 200 mµ particle size dispersed in an organic solvent in 1 50 weight as SiO₂, in the amount of 100 parts by weight as SiO₂ an alkyl silicate in the amount of 20 200 parts by weight as SiO₂ and water in the amount of 0.5 7.0 mol relative to 1 gram atom of silicon in said alkyl silicate.
