# Operating mechanism for a circuit breaker.

## Abstract
A circuit breaker operating mechanism is provided in which a rotatable shaft has a first member mounted on it for rotating the shaft only in one direction, a sec ond member mounted on the shaft for rotating the shaft only in the same direction as the first means rotates it, and alternatively with the first means and a cam secured to the shaft to rotate therewith, a spring member ar ranged so that the closing cam rotates for charging clos ing energy into the spring member, and rotates also for discharging the closing energy charged within the spring member, a linkage provided with one end sliding on the closing cam, and a coupling shaft coupled to the other end of the linkage and which rotates in a direction de pending upon the linkage movement effected by rotation of the closing cam, thereby moving a movable contact into an open or closed position with respect to a fixed contact, and a tripping member which operates in re sponse to a command signal based on occurrence of an exessive overcurrent, thereby driving the linkage, the cam causing the spring member to discharge closing energy charged therein due to the cam rotation by a spe cified constant angle and permits the rotation of the coupling shaft in one direction through the linkage, there by moving the movable contact into the closed position, and a tripping member causes through the linkage the coupling shaft to rotate in the other direction opposite to that of closing operation, thereby moving the movable contact into the open position.
