## Description
The present invention relates to novel thermoplastic aromatic polyamideimides hereinafter called PAI , being superior in heat stability and fluidity at the temperatures of 300 to 400 C, injection moldable and having desired characteristics. It has already been known well that aromatic PAI copolymers, superior in heat resistance, are generally obtainable by polycondensing an aromatic tricarboxylic acid anhydride or a derivative thereof and an aromatic diamine or a derivative thereof e.g., Japanese Laid Open Patent Nos. 15637 1967, 19274 1969, 2397 1970, 4077 1974, 33120 1975, etc. . Further a number of proposals have already been advanced for modifications of basic PAI copolymers by using an aromatic tricarboxylic acid anhydride or a derivative thereof and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid dichloride as acid components e.g., Laid Open Patent No. 8894 1975, 121397 1975, 16908 1971, 12594 1974, 13240 1974, 26316 1074, 501882 1981, etc. . And it is also well known that special aromatic PAI copolymers are synthesized by the reaction between a trimellitic acid monochloride anhydride and an amide bond incorporating aromatic diamine represented by general formula Besides Laid Open Patent No. 13240 1974 discloses PAI copolymers wherein Ar is a simplex material synthesized by a process consisting of the first step of the But the heat stability, melt fluidity and other physical properties of the aromatic PAI copolymers generally proposed hitherto are not well balanced when they are melt molded. For example the PAI copolymers represented by general formula A purpose of the present invention is to obtain aromatic PAI copolymers superior in melt moldability because of their high heat stability and fluidity at the temperatures of 300 to 400 C and providing well balanced physical properties for their moldings by solving the problems of conventional ones described above. The thermoplastic aromatic polyamideimide copolymers according to the present invention comprise the structural units represented by formula The thermoplastic PAI copolymers according to the present invention are mainly composed of the three units represented by formulae A, B and C, components A and B C being at a substantially equal molar ratio, component A and B or C being alternately interconnected, and components B and C as diamine residual groups being at a ratio of 0.05 0.95 mole to 0.95 0.05 mole. The component Ar Ar of units B and C is composed of mixture of 2 components having following structures and ratios. Unit Ar₁ of Ar Ar should not exceed 70 mole . Otherwise the PAI copolymers obtained will conspicuously decrease in stiffness and mechanical strength. Unit Ar₂ of Ar Ar should not exceed 95 mole . Otherwise the PAI copolymers obtained will conspicuously decrease in melt moldability, heat characteristic or mechanical strength. So that the ratios Ar₁ and Ar₂ should be selected out of 5 to 70 mole , preferably 15 to 60 mole , and 95 to 30 mole , preferably 85 to 40 mole respectively. Z materials of unit A mentioned above are the trivalent aromatic groups having two of three functional groups Further the thermoplastic aromatic polyamideimide copolymers according to the present invention can include The PAI copolymers according to the present invention are producible by using any of a number of hitherto proposed general production processes. The following three processes may be cited as representative highly practicable ones. The reaction of an aromatic diisocyanate with an aromatic tricarboxylic acid anhydride or imide dicarboxylic acid synthesized from an aromatic tricarboxylic acid anhydride and an aromatic diamine 2 1 mole ratio e.g., Laid Open Patent Nos. 19274 1969, 2397 1970, 33120 1975, etc. . The reaction of an aromatic tricarboxylic acid monochloride anhydride and an aromatic diamine e.g., Laid Open Patent No. 15637 1967, etc. The direct reaction of an aromatic diamine with aromatic tricarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof excl. acid chloride derivative in the presence of a dehydration catalyst in a polar organic solvent e.g., Laid Open Patent No. 4077 1974 . The acid chloride process is most recommendable among the aforementioned processes because of the advantages of easy preparation of raw materials and of highly linear less branching structure , PAI copolymers of high degree of polymerization being readily obtainable. The acid chloride process for producing the PAI copolymers according to the present invention will be described hereinafter. First, dissolved in an organic polar solvent is 1 mole of an aromatic tricarboxylic acid monochloride anhydride, and 0.9 to 1.1 mole of a diamine mixture composed of 5 to 100 mole of an aromatic diamine represented by formula I Next the resultant mixture is agitated at about 0.5 to 1 hour at the temperatures of from 20 to 80 C and its polymerization reaction is accelerated by adding about 0.8 to 1.2 mole of a hydrogen chloride scavenger if necessary. The reaction completes in 0.5 to 10 hours. The copolymer produced at this stage is so called polyamide amic acid obtained by converting the greater part e.g., 50 to 100 of unit A of the PAI copolymers according to the present invention into a ring open precursor amide amic acid unit The organic polar solvents to be used for this first step include, N,N dialkyl carboxylic acid amides such as N,N dimethylacetoamide, N,N diethylacetoamide and so forth hetero cyclic compounds such as N methylpyrrolidone, tetrahydrothiophene 1,1 dioxide, 1,3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone and so forth and phenols such as cresol, xylenol and so forth. Particularly preferable thereamong are N methylpyrrolidone and N,N dimethylacetoamide. The hydrogen chloride scavengers to be added if necessary at the first step include aliphatic tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine and tributylamine cyclic organic bases such as pyridine, lutidine, collidine and quinoline and organic oxide compounds such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The polyamide amic acid obtained at the first step undergoes the second dehydration ring closure step for its conversion into polyamideimide copolymers according to the present invention. Ring closure reaction of dehydration is performed by liquid phase process or solid phase process. The former is divided into chemical dehydrator process and simple heating process. The chemical dehydrator process is performed by using aliphatic acid anhydrides such as acetic anhydride and propionic anhydride P₂O₅ and other chemical dehydrators at the temperatures of 0 to 120 C, preferably 10 to 60 C. The latter is performed by heating polyamide amic acid solution at the temperatures of 50 to 400 C, preferably 100 to 250 C. Therein the combination use of the azeotropic solvents useful for water removal such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and so forth is effective. For solid phase process, a polyamide amic acid polymer is separated from a polyamide amic acid solution obtained at the first step and next heat treated in solid state. Liquid which is miscible with a reaction mixture solvent but in which polyamide amic acid is not soluble, e.g., water, methanol or like, is used as precipitant for separating a polyamide amic acid polymer. In solid phase heat treatment, proper conditions are generally selected out of the temperatures from 150 to 400 C and the time from 0.5 to 50 hours for securing sufficient ring closure percentage and melting fluidity. Treatment should not be continued at 250 to 400 C for an excessively long time. Otherwise the polymer itself will form a 3 dimensional bridging structure to considerably decrease in melting fluidity. Aromatic diamines I and II are obtained by attaching amino groups NH₂ on the both sides of the bivalent aromatic residual groups of units B and C according to the present invention. A typical example of aromatic diamine I , The PAI copolymers according to the present invention are obtainable by the production processes described heretofore. Copolymerizable materials other than units A, B and C components can be used in combination for an reaction system in such quantities as to prevent any considerable decrease in melt moldability and physical characteristics of the PAI copolymers to be produced according to the present invention. Most of the imide units of the aromatic PAI copolymers according to the present invention have a closed ring structure, although some of the imide units remain an open ring amic acid bond in some cases. These PAI copolymers are high molecular weight polymers having a logarithmic viscosity ηinh more than 0.20, preferably more than 0.25 measured at a concentration of 0.5 by weight and at a temperature of 30 C in a N methylpyrrolidone solvent, and can be used for the following various purposes. Compression molding is generally performed at the temperatures of 300 to 400 C and at the pressures of 50 to 500 kg cm² after dry blending into the power of the PAI copolymers according to the present invention another kind of polymer, an additive, a filler, a reinforcer or like if necessary. Extrusion or injection molding is performed at the temperatures of 300 to 400 C supplying a dry blending mixture of a PAI copolymer according to the present invention with another kind of polymer, an additive, a filler, a reinforcer or like or a pellet thereof produced by using an extruder to a molding machine. Particularly the aromatic PAI copolymers according to the present invention are suitable for extrusion or injection molding because their heat stability and melt fluidity are balanced well at the temperatures of 300 to 400 C. The moldings improved more in heat deflection temperature, tensile strength, flexural strength, frictional wear resistance and other physical properties are obtainable by heat treating the heat melt moldings of the PAI copolymers according to the present invention at high temperatures more than 200 C and less than their glass transition temperature, particularly more than 220 C and less than the glass transition temperature 5 C , for more than 5 hours, particularly for more than 10 hours. Heat treatment temperature should not preferably exceed the glass transition temperature. Otherwise they will show a tendency of deformation to affect their practicability. Heat treatment apparatuses are not limited, and an ordinary electric heating oven is sufficient for achieving its purpose. For manufacturing the films and textiles of the thermoplastic aromatic polyamideimide copolymers according to the present invention, a polymerization finish solution is applicable to dry or dry and wet type extruding process. And melt molding is also possible after, if necessary, adding an appropriate additive to separated dry polymers. Their laminated boards are manufactured through a process consisting of impregnating a cloth or mat made from a glass, carbon, asbestos or other fiber with a polymer solution, obtaining a prepreg by the dry heat hardening of the resultant impregnated body and pressing it at the temperatures of 200 to 400 C and at the pressures of 50 to 300 kg cm². The paints of the thermoplastic aromatic polyamideimide copolymers according to the present invention are produced by a process consisting of mixing a solvent to a polymerization finish solution if necessary and controlling the concentration of the resultant mixture for their practical use. The PAI copolymers according to the present invention are permitted to contain fillers such as a wear resistance improvers graphite, carborundum, silica powder, molybdenum disulfide, flororesins, etc., b reinforcers glass fiber, carbon fiber, boron fiber, silicon carbide fiber, carbon whisker, asbestos fiber, asbestos, metal fiber, etc., c non inflammability improvers antimony trioxide, magnesium carbonate, sodium carbonate, etc., d electric characteristic improvers clay, mica, etc., e tracking resistance improvers asbestos, silica, graphite, etc., f acid resistance improvers barium sulfate, silica, calcium methasilicate, etc., g heat conductivity improvers the powder of iron, zinc, aluminum, copper and other metals, h others glass beads, glass balls, sodium carbonate, alumina, talc, diatomaceous earth, hydrate alumina, mica, shirasu balloon, asbestos, various metal oxides, inorganic pigments and other synthetic and natural compounds stable at temperatures above 300 C. The PAI copolymers according to the present invention are superior in melt moldability because of their high heat stability and melt fluidity, provide well balanced physical properties for their moldings and permit the efficient production of high performance materials and moldings by extrusion or injection molding methods. For example, the PAI copolymers composed of the Further the present invention is capable of providing moldings having exceptionally well balanced superior physical properties a heat deflection temperature more than 287 C, a flexural strength more than 2,320 kg cm² and Izod impact strength more than 15 kg cm cm notched after heat treatment. The materials and moldings of the PAI copolymers according to the present invention can be extensively used for manufacturing electric and electronic, aircraft and space unit, automotive, office machinery and other parts. The present invention will be described in further details in connection with their examples and comparative examples below.
