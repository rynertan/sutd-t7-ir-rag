Example 7 The post emergence herbicidal activity of the various compounds of this invention is demonstrated by greenhouse testing in the following manner. A good grade of top soil is placed in aluminum pans having holes in the bottom and compacted to a depth of .95 to 1.27 cm. from the top of the pan. A predetermined number of seeds of each of several dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous annual plant species and or vegetative propagules for the perennial plant species. The seeds and or vegetative propagules are covered with soil and leveled. The pans are then placed on a sand bench in the greenhouse and watered from below as needed. After the plants reach the desired age two to three weeks , each pan except for the control pans is removed individually to a spraying chamber and sprayed by means of an atomizer operating at a positive air pressure of approximately 1.46 kg cm2 absolute.The atomizer contains 6 ml.of a solution or suspension of the chemical and an amount of a cyclohexanone emulsifying agent mixture so that the spray solution or suspension contains about 0.4 by weight of the emulsifier. The spray solution or suspension contains a sufficient amount of the candidate chemical in order to give application rates cor esponding to those set forth in the tables. The spray solution is prepared by taking an aliquot of a 1.0 by weight stock solution or suspension of the candidate chemical in an organic solvent such as acetone or tetrahydrofuran or in water. The emulsifying agent employed is a mixture comprising 35 weight percent butylamine dodecylbenzene sulfonate and 65 weight percent of a tall oil ethylene oxide condensate having about 6 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of tall oil.The pans are returned to the greenhouse and watered as before and the injury to the plants as compared to the control is observed at approximately two and four weeks as indicated in the tables under WAT and the results recorded. In some instances, the four week observations are omitted.

Frcm the test results presented in Tables I andII, it can be seen that the post emergent herbicidal activity of the compounds of this invention is, for the most part, general in nature. In certain specific instances, however, some selectivity is demonstrated. In this regard it should be recognized that each individual species selected for the above tests is a representative member of a recognized family of plant species. The herbicidal compositions, including concentrates which require dilution prior to application to the plants, of this invention contain from 5 to 95 parts by weight of at least one compound of this invention and from 5 to 95 parts by weight of an adjuvant in liquid or solid form, for example, from about 0.25 to 25 parts by weight of wetting agent, from about 0.25 to 25 parts by weight of a dispersant and from 4.5 to about 94.5 parts by weight of inert liquid extender, e.g., water, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, all parts being by weight of the total composition.Where required, from about 0.1 to 2.0 parts by weight of the inert liquid extender can be replaced by a corrosion inhibitor or anti foaming agent, or both. The compositions are prepared by admixing the active ingredient with an adjuvant including diluents, extenders, carriers and conditioning agents to provide compositions in the form of finely divided particulate solids, pellets, solutions, dispersions or emulsions. Thus, the active ingredient can be used with an adjuvant such as a finely divided solid, a liquid or organic origin, water, a wetting agent, a dispersing agent, an emulsifying agent or any suitable combination of these. The herbicidal compositions of this invention, particularly liquids and soluble powders, preferably contain as a conditioning agent one or more surface active agents in amounts sufficient to render a given composition readily dispersible in water or in oil. The incorporation of a surface active agent into the compositions greatly enhances their efficacy. By the term surface active agent , it is understood that wetting agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents and emulsifying agents are included therein Anionic, cationic and nonionic agents can be used with equal facility. Preferred wetting agents are alkyl benzene and alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sulfated fatty alcohols, amines or acid amides, long chain acid esters of sodium isothionate, esters of sodium sulfosuccinate, sulfated or sulfonated fatty acid esters petroleum sulfonates, sulfonated vegetable oils, polyoxyethylene derivatives of phenols and alkylphenols particularly isooctylphenol and nonylphenol and polyoxyethylene derivatives of the monohigher fatty acid esters of hexitol anhydrides e.g., sorbitan . Preferred dispersants are methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium lignin, sulfonates, polymeric alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthalene sulfonate, polymethylene bisnaphthalenesulfonate and sodium N methylN long chain acid taurates. The application of an effective amount of the compounds of this invention to the plant is essential and critical for the practice of the present invention. The exact amount of active ingredient to be employed is dependent upon the response desired in the plant as well as such other factors as the plant species and stage of development thereof, and the amount of rainfall as well as the specific glycine employed. In foliar treatment.for the control of vegetative growth, the active ingredients are applied in amounts from about 0.112 to about 22.4 or more kilograms per hectare. In pre emergent treatments, the rate of application can be from about 0.56 to about 22 4 or more kilograms per hectare. In applications for the control of aquatic plants, the active ingredients are applied in amounts of from about 0.01 parts per million to about 1000 parts per million, based on the aquatic medium. An effective amount for phytotoxic or herbicidal control is that amount necessary for overall or selective control, i.e., a phytotoxic or herbicidal amount. It is believed that one skilled in the art can readily determine from the teachings of this specification, including examples, the approximate application rate. Although this invention has been described with respect to specific modifications, the details thereof are not to be construed as limitations, for it will be apparent that various equivalents, changes and modifications may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope thereof and it is understood that such equivalent embodiments are intended to be included herein.
