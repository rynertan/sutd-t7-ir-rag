# Means for transferring electrical energy to and from living tissue.

## Abstract
Means for transferring electrical energy to and from living tissue comprises a glove 12 of thin, flexible elas tomeric material, which carries electrodes, 14, 18, 20, 24 electrically connected to a connector 38 disposed at the cuff of the glove. The connector permits the electrodes to be electrically connected to a source of electrical energy or to a load, so that electrical energy may be applied to or drawn from living tissue.
