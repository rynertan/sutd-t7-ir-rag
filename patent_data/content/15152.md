# A method for removing multivalent heavy metal ions from a metal plating waste effluent.

## Abstract
Multivalent heavy metal ions are removed from metal plating waste streams by passing them through an unex panded vermiculite cation exchange column. The column is effective to remove copper, zinc, and nickel ions and mixtures thereof. Where cyanide and cyanide metal complexes are also represent in the plating waste stream, the stream is pretre ated to destroy the cyanide and cyanide complexes prior to passage through the ion exchange column.
