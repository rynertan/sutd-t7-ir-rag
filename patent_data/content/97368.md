# POSITION INDICATOR

## Abstract
A tablet is provided with a thin film on a surface, preferably a flat surface. The thin film has characteristics to provide a uniform resistance, preferably of a relatively low value, across the tablet. A flexible membrane is disposed in spaced, but contiguous, relationship to the thin film and is provided with a thin conductive layer defining a ground plane. The membrane is capable of being flexed into contact with the thin film at any desired position. A voltage having a floating reference is applied to the thin film by a voltage source having its opposite terminals floating relative to ground. Means such as diodes may be disposed at spaced intervals along the periphery of the thin film for providing for a progressive voltage only in particular vectors along first and second co ordinate axes. Means are responsive to the progressive voltages respectively pro duced along the first and second axes for indicating the position of contact between the ground plane and the thin film. Such means may be responsive to the position of the ground produced on the thin film by contact with the ground plane, such ground position on the thin film controlling the voltages provided by the opposite terminals of the voltage source relative to ground. The apparatus of this invention provides output indica tions of the position of contact between the thin film and the ground plane only when a contact has been provided on a positive basis. This is accomplished by providing for a sequence of progressive indications of the output voltage along each of the first and second axes. Output voltages representing the position of contact between the thin film and the ground plane are produced only when the progres sive voltages in each sequence differ from one another by less than a particular amount.
