# IMAGING FILM AND COMPOSITION EMPLOYING A TELLURIUM COMPOUND AND METHOD FOR RECORDING ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION

## Abstract
Imaging compositions employing a tellurium com pound, a reductant precursor, a masked reducing agent and a source of labile hydrogen are improved by the inclusion of a base which may be inorganic or organic. Suitable inorganic bases include alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides and ammonium hydroxide. Suitable organic bases include amines and heterocyclic nitrogen atom con taining compounds.
