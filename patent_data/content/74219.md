# Arrangements for resolving magnetic field components.

## Abstract
A sensing element suitable for sensing two components h A control circuit applies current, within a periodic cycle, in alternate directions through conductor 7 whilst a current applied in a single direction through conductor 13 . In the following cycle the current direction through conductor 13 is reversed. Values of the element 8 electrical resistivity for the four combination of current and hence magnetic field directions allow solution of a simultaneous equation to yield h
