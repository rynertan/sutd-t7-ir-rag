# Ethynylated aromatic compounds and process for making same.

## Abstract
Novel ethynyl terminated aromatic compounds where in the aromatic component is a benzaldehyde, benzimid azoquinazoline, benzoate, benzeneamine, aryl orthoester, benzotrifluoride. pyrene, anthracene, phenanthrene, phe nylbenzimidazole, thiophene, furan, or pyridine are de scribed. These and prior art ethynyl terminated aromatic compounds are prepared by a novel process comprising coupling an aromatic halide having a base sensitive sub stituent with an end protected acetylene in the presence of a metal catalyst to form an end protected arylacetyle ne, and subsequently removing the end protecting group. Typically p bromobenzaldehyde is reacted with ethy nyltrimethylsilane in the presence of triphenylphosphine and palladium acetate. The silane protecting group is removed with potassium carbonate in methanol to pro vide p ethynylbenzaldehyde. The products are useful for the production of ethy nyl terminated aromatic oligomers.
