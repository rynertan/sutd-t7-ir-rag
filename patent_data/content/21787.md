# Octane improvements in catalytic cracking.

## Abstract
Octane and total yield improvement in catalytic cracking processes can be attained by the addition to conventional cracking catalyst of very small amounts of additive catalyst comprising a zeolite having a silica to alumina mole ratio greater than 12 and a constraint index of about 1 to 12. The weight ratio of the zeolite of the additive catalyst to the amount of active component, e.g. faujasite zeolite, in the conventional cracking catalyst ranges from between about 1 400 and about 1 15.
