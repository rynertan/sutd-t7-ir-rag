## Description
poLyTITANIurl CiSELATES This invention relates to polytitanium chelates, methods of preparing them and the use of such chelates as thickeners for fluids used in resource recovery operations, such as by incorporating the polytitanium chelates described herein in drilling muds, consolidation fluids or fracturing fluids Pure polytitanium chelates may be obtained from dialkoxytitanium bis ss diketonates in small amounts of water. The resultant products, when utilized as described herein as thickening agents for fluids used in resource recovery operations, display a delayed effect in increasing the viscosity of the fluids, thereby permitting the handling and transport of the process fluids at viscosities significantly lower than those ultimately Imparted to the fluids by the polytitanium chelate thickening agents.Energy demands and wear and tear on the fluid transport equipment are thereby reduced without sacrificing ultimately desired viscosities at the point of fluid use. Sugiyama et al., in Japanese Kokai 74 07,227, datedJanuary 22, 1974 and reported at 81 Chemical Abstracts 26523v 1974 , describe the preparation of poly titaniumoxy bis ss diketonate having the formulaEMI1.1 where L is a B diketone residue and n is greater than or equal to 2. The products are described as being useful as crosslinking agents for resins. In one example, 90 parts acetylacetone were added to 100 parts water, followed by 10 wt. aq. Na2CO3 addition to pH 5.1. The mixture, after 3 hours at room temperature, yielded a precipitate of 85.2 parts product.The same authors, in Japanese Kokai 74 07,226 of the same date and reported at 81 Chemical Abstracts 26524w 1974 , describe products having the same formula as shown above but prepared by bringing 120 parts diisopropoxytitanium bis acctylacteonate in 500 parts water to pH 6.1 with NEMI2.1 Na2CO3, and then stirring the mixture for 30 minutes at 400C to yield 78 parts product. We have found that dialkoxytitanium bis p diketonates may be converted to pure polytitanium chelates in good yields without acid, with very little pater and without use of processes requiring elevated temperatures. Moreover, the products of the processes of this invention are particularly useful as delayed action thickening agents for aqueous polysaccharide solutions used as process fluids in resource recovery operations.IN THE FIGURE EMI2.2 Figure 1 shows the time versus viscosity plots for various embodiments of the invention as compared to a pricr art thickening agent and illustrates the delayed action effect of thickening agents according to the invention as compared to the rapid thickening effect of an exemplary prior art thickening agent. Processes leading to products of this invention can be carried out between OOC to 1000C, more preferably between 10 C to 800C, and most preferably between 20 C and 400C.The reactant can be any of the dialkoxytitanium bis ss diketonates , that is, R10 R20 Ti R3C3HO2R4 2 EMI3.1 where R1 and R2 are individually alkyl having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, including methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, tert butyl, sec. butyl and the like up to octyl, and and and R4 are also, individually, from methyl to octyl. The most preferable reactant has R1 R2 isopropyl andR3 R4 methyl. The amount of water added to the dialkoxytitanium bis p diketonate should be in the range of from about 0.07 to about 0.3 parts by weight, with about 0.1 parts by weight water preferred. The following examples illustrate the preparation of polytitaniu chelates according to the invention Example 1 1415.3 gm. diisopropoxytitanium bis acetylacetonate 75 in isopropanol was added to 106.44 gm. water at room temperature 25 C . The mixture developed a yellow precipitate within 30 minutes and was allowed to stir overnight. The following morning the mixture was filtered, yielding 730 gm. of polytitanium chelate 95 yield .Example 2 120 gm. diisopropoxytitanium bis acetylacetonate 75 in isopropanol was added to 8.4 gm. water at room temperature 25 C . The mixture developed needle like crystals in 30 minutes, resulting in a yield of 96 of polytitanium chelate. Example 3 120 gm. diisopropoxytitanium bis acetylacetonate 75 in isopropanol was added to 36 gm. H2O. A precipitate developed in 30 minutes amounting to a 92 yield of polytitanium chelate.Example 4 120 gin. diisopropoxytitanium bis acetylacetonate was added to 10 gm. water and the mixture heated to 400C. A precipitate of polytitanium chelate was obtained in 30 minutes, with a yield of 92 .Example 5 120 gm. diisopropoxytitanium bis acetylacetonate and 10 gm.water ere combined at 100C and allowed to sit for several hours. A 93 yield of polytitanium chelate was isolated upon filtrations. Elemental analysis of the polytitanium chelate obtained from the foregoing examples yielded the following e.N perirlent21 data Theory Actual H 5.34 5.60 C 45.80 46.10 M.W. 262 336The molecular weight discrepancy is believed to be a result of the method used to determine molecular weight. Methanol as used as the solvent and it is believed the polytitanium chelate compound reacts with methanol in the following manner EMI4.1 This would yield an analyzed product having a molecular weight of 324. The above product of the invention is totally miscible in hot chloroform and, upon cooling, yields large hexagonal plates. The product is a pure compound and possibly in the form of cyclic repeating units of C1oHl405Tit i.e.,EMI5.1 or cyclic dimer, i.e.,EMI5.2 or cyclic trimer, i.e.,EMI5.3 The polytitanium chelates of this invention are effective thickening agents for polysaccharides in aqueous solutions, most notably polymers of guar gum and cellulose derivatives. Particularly preferred hydratable polysaccharides are galactomannan gums and derivatives thereof, and cellulose derivatives.Examples of such compounds are guar gum, locust bean gum, karaya gum, sodium carboxymethylguar, hydroxyethylguar, sodium carboxymethylhyaroxyethylguar, hydroxypropylguar, sodium carboxymethylhydroxymethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylhydroxyethylcellulose, and hydroxyethylcellulose. The hydroxyethylcellulose derivatives used as gelling agents should be those having from about 0.5 to about 10 mcles of ethylene oxide per anhydroglucose unit. The most preferred gelling agent for use in accordance with the present invention is hydroxypropylguar HPG . Thickened aqueous solutions as described herein are particularly useful in the oil and gas industry as drilling muds, sands consolidations fluids and fracturing fluids. The polytitanium chelates are especially useful for one pack systems, in which the dry thickening agent is pre blended with a polysaccharide such as a galactomannan gum, or two pack systems. In the one pack system, the preferred hydratable compound is hydroxypropylguar HPG and the preferred thickening agent is the polytitanium chelate obtained by the previously described processes when diisopropoxytitanium bis acetylacetonate is used as a reactant. The preferred weight ratios of HPG to 1 the polytitanium chelate are from about 40 1 to about 1 4, with the most preferred ratios being from about 3 1 to about 1 1. The following examples illustrate the one pack system Example 6 3 gm. HPG and 2 gm. polytitanium chelate according to the preceding examples is allowed to hydrate in 300 cc. stirred water at room temperature, yielding a crosslinked HPG solution of approximately 1 HPG. Various other solid additives such as carbonate and bicarbonate buffers may be added as well as chelates like citric acid for control of iron and potassium chloride for clay control.Example 7 3 gm. HPG and 1 gm. solid polytitanium chelate obtained according to the preceding examples ere dry blended and simultaneously added to 300 cc. stirred tap water at room temperature. The mixture was allowed to stir for one minute until noticeably thick. Viscosity measurements were then made with a Brookfield Viscometer, Model LV, fitted with aNo. A spindle, and the following approximate data were obtained Time min. 3 5 16 27 36 Viscosity Cp 17,000 28,000 87,000 160,000 180,000It should be noted that the thickened acqueous solutions are non Newtonian and the viscosity data provided above and in subsequent examples are therefore approximations. The following example illustrates the use of a polytitanium chelate according to the invention as a thickening agent in a two pack system t Example 8 316 gm. of a stirred hydrated HPG solution was thickened with 0.3 gm. of solid polytitanium chelate obtained according to the preceding examples. Thickening, as noted by the gel climbing the stirrer shaft, occurred in 20 30 seconds, with the fluid reaching a viscosity of 120,000 cp. However, the fluid continued to thicken over a 54 minute period and achieved a final viscosity of 170,000 cp.Example 9 Example 8 was repeated with the substitution of Xay FriesTIACA TM , a prior art thickening agent bis 2,4 pentanedione bisisopropyltitanate , for the polytitanium chelate, and maximum viscosity was attained in only 14 minutes.Example 10 The procedure of Example 6 was repeated and, when the vortex of the stirred mixture started closing, viscosity measurements were begun which yielded the following approximate data Time mir.. 5 10 20 26 33 45 Viscosity Cp 25,000 45,000 84,000 97,000 167,000 198,000Example 11 The procedure of Example 8 was repeated and viscosity measurements yielded the following approximate data Time min. 6 12 21 26 41 Viscosity Cp 120,000 133,000 146,000 156,000 183,000 The immediately preceding examples indicate that in addition to being useful as solid one pack or two pack thickening agents, polytitanium chelates according to the invention have further utility in that total reactivity is somewhat delayed although sufficient viscosity is initially built up to transport propping agents, the viscosity of the thickened fluid continues to build over a period of about one hour. This attribute is cost effective, in that less horsepower is needed to pump a less viscous fluid and the mechanical stresses imposed on the fluid transport process equipment are reduced. Figure 1 illustrates viscosity variation with time for various formulations according to the invention and for a prior art formulation. Line A is representative of the effect of a one pack 3 2 HPG polytitanium chelate formulatior as in Example 10, line 13 illustrates the results with a one pack 3 1 formulation according to Example 7, curve C represents the use of a two pack system as described in Example 11, and curve D shows the effects of the prior art stem described in Example 9. The delayed effect of thickening agents according to the invention as compared to the rapid effect of the exemplary prior art thickening agent is apparent from the illustration. It will be understood that the specification and examples are illustrative but not limitative of the present invention and that other embodiments within the spirit and scope of the invention will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. 11
