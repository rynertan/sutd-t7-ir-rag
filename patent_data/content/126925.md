## Description
PAPER SHEET PROCESSING MACH Background of the Invention The present invention relates to a paper sheet processing machine for discharging paper sheets such as c oupons one by one. A known method for discharging paper sheets in processing machines has been to provide an inclined guide member G in front of the leading ends of paper sheets C stacked in 2 sheet accommodating chamber, as shown in Figure 1. The paper sheets are then dispensed one by one by means of a pair of vertically aligned separating rollers a and b thus discharging them successively. In this type of method, the leading edges in the discharging direction of some paper sheets C may be bent inwardly, for example. Since the separating roller a rotates in a direction opposite to the paper sheet discharging direction, as indicated in Figure 1, when a bent sheet is to be discharged, the bent portion of the sheet frictionally engages separating roller a which is rotating in the opposite direction.Consequently, the bent sheet is sometimes not discharged in the discharging direction, but is wrapped about the roller a rotating in the opposite direction and tends to move upwardly along the outside wall g of the guide member G irrespective of the rotating direction of the other separating roller b. Sometimes while the bent sheet is partly discharged up the outside wall g, it separates the front portions of the separating rollers a and b from the leading end portion of a next paper sheet to be separated and discharged and thus makes it impossible to separate and discharge the next sheet. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to overcome the aforesaid drawbacks in paper sheet processing machines. An object of the invention is to provide a paper sheet processing machine which reliably dispenses single sheets one at a time. Another object of the invention is to provide a paper sheet processing machine which dispenses sheets more reliably one at a time than the machine discussed above, yet is simpler and less expensive to fabricate and maintain.SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION According to the present invention, a paper sheet processing machine comprises a main roller which rotates in response to a sheet releasing command signal and a delivery roller which is jointly driven with the main roller. The delivery roller is in frictional contact with a sheet at the bottom portion of a magazine or accommodating chamber for a predetermined period of time and upon rotation, delivers it from the chamber to the main roller. A fixed member made of rubber, for example, has formed therein at least two ribs extending in the sheet delivering discharging direction and is disposed opposite to the main roller at the bottom portion of the accommodating chamber.Due to the positions of the main roller and the ribs of the fixed member, the bottom paper sheet delivered by the delivery roller is separated accurately from the stacked paper sheets and delivered discharged to a take out opening.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The above objects and features, as well as other objects and features, will be best understood in light of the following description of a preferred embodiment, taken together with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a partial sectional view of a conventional processing machine Figure 2 is a side view of a machine according to the present invention Figure 3 is a front view of the machine of Figure 2 Figure 4 is an enlarged partial side view of details of the device of Figures 2 3 and Figure 5 is an enlarged partial bottom perspective view of the paper sheet separating portion of the present invention.DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EW ODIMENT One example of a device according to the invention is described in detail with reference to the drawings. In Figures 2 and 3 the reference numeral 1 represents a paper sheet magazine or accommodating chamber fcr stacking therein a plurality of paper sheets C such as coupons. The sheet accommodating chamber 1 comprises upright machine frames 2 3 on respective sides of a paper sheet processing machine N and a bottom portion 4 comprising a bottom plate 6 inclined at a predetermined angle toward a discharge chute 5. The chute 5 leads to an opening not shown for taking out the paper sheets C. Therefore, the paper sheets C stacked in the sheet accommodating chamber l are accommodated therein while their leading end portions are inclined toward the discharge chute 5. The bottom plate 6 has at least one cut out portion not shown forked therein through which a delivery roller 12, to be described below, can be brought into contact with the lowermost paper sheet Q in the sheet accommndating chan r l. Roller 12 may be brought into contact with sheet Cn by, for example, control of an electromagnetic solenoid 14. The reference numeral 7 represents a main roller which is driven through gears 8 and 9 by a driving device 10, such as a motor, actuated by a paper sheet releasing command signal generated by, for example, pressing a sheet releasing button. The main roller 7 is rotatably mounted immediately below the lower most inclined part of the bottom portion of the sheet accommodating chamber I and is mounted on the machine frames 2 and 3. Roller 7 preferably includes a plurality of roll sections, as shown in Figure 3. The reference numeral 11 represents a fixed member made of rubber, for example, fixed to that part of the sheet accomsnodatfng chamber 1 adjacent the leading end portions of the paper sheets C located within , and in the lower portion of, the sheet accommodating charter. X is an abutting inclined surface of member 11 against which the leading end portions of the paper sheets C located in the lower portion of chamber 1 abut, as shown in Figure 4. At least two elastic or resilient ribs L as shown in Figure 5 are provided adjacent to each section of roll 7 and positioned in the same plane as the circumference of main roller 7 or slightly overlapping the circumference and extending in the delivery direction of the paper sheets. The device in accordance with the invention operates in the following manner. The delivery roller 12 is driven to rotate with the rotation of the main roller 7 through an endless belt 13. Delivery roller 12 is also coupled through an actuating member 15 to an electromagnetic solenoid 14 fixed te the inside of the machine frame 2. The delivery roller 12 is of such a size that a part of its circumference nay be projected into or withdrawn from the cut out portion not shown formed in the bottom plate 6 of the sheet accommodating chamber 1. The axis of main roller 7 serves as a fulcrum upon energizing or deenergizing the magnetic solenoid 14 to move actuator 15 and delivery roller 12. Accordingly, when the delivery roller 12 is projected into the cut out portion, the delivery roller 12 is pressed into contact with the lowermost sheet Cn in the sheet accommodating chamber 1 and delivers it toward the main roller 7. The ribs L and the main roller 7 cooperate in the following manner. When the delivery roller 12 delivers the lowermost paper sheet Cn in the sheet accommodating chamber 1, the upper surface of the leading end portion of the delivered sheet Cn encounters the frictional resistance of the ribs L. However, the frictional resistance of the ribs L exerted on the upper surface is overcome because of the frictional force of the rotating delivery roller 12 added to the frictional force or the rotating main roller 7 in the delivery direction of the paper sheet Cn. Consequently, the lowermost paper sheet Cn can be separated from the stacked paper sheets C The motion of the paper sheets stacked on top of the delivered sheet Cn is arrested by contact of their leading end portions with the ribsL.The other stacked sheets do not receive the rotational frictional force of the main roller 7 or of the delivery roller 12, and therefore are not discharged into the take out opening together with the delivered sheet Cn. Thus, due to cooperation between the ribs L and the main roller 7, the leading end portion of the delivered sheet Cn is accurately separated from the next sheet to be delivered and is discharged into the take out opening through the discharge chute 5. Thus, a device in accordance with the invention comprises a main roller which rotates in response to a sheet releasing command signal and a delivery roller which is driven by the rotation of the main roller The delivery roller contacts the paper sheet at the bottom of the sheet accommodating chamber for a predetermined period of time and delivers this sheet to the main roller. A fixed member made of rubber, for example, having formed therein at least two ribs extending in the sheet delivery direction is disposed opposite to the main roller at the bottom portion of the paper sheet accommodating chamber. As a result of unique cooperation between the main roller and the ribs of the fixed member, first or lower most sheet delivered by the delivery roller is accurately separated from the stacked sheets and discharged into the take out opening. Hence, while in conventional paper sheet processing machines, a sheet to be separated and delivered may be caught and held by the conventional separating rollers in such manner as to cover the leading end portion of a next sheet to be separated and delivered, thus making it impossible to separate and discharge the next sheet, the present device is completely free from this trouble. While the present invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment illustrated in the accompanying drawings, it is not limited to the details shown therein as modifications can be made by those of ordinary skill in the art.
