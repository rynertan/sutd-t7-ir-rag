# Sole construction for footwear.

## Abstract
The manufacture of a sole unit for footwear, such as an athletic shoe including an integral midsole wedge 20,20 or a separable wedge 30,30a for use with a midsole. The integral midsole wedge unit and the separable wedge for use with a midsole both comprise a shell 24,24 ,36 and a core 22,22 ,34,34a at least partially encapsulated within the shell. The shell 24,24 ,36 and core 22,22 ,34,34a comprise plastic materials which have individual strengths and weak nesses in a shoe construction, yet provide, as a composite improved results in a shock dispersion and memory system. In the manufacture the core 22,22 ,34,34a is supported in a mold by a plurality of pins 26 extending from an upper and lower mold half toward a parting line or the core 22,22 ,34,34a is supported on one or the other of an outsole 16 or insole of the sole unit and closed in the mold. The material of the shell 24,24 ,36 is poured or injected into the mold.
