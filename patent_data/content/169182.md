## Description
The present invention concerns the cutting of a running web, such as a paper, plastic or textile web.For manufacturers of paper, for instance, there have been certain problems involved in cutting a running paper web, particularly webs of some thickness, such as wrapping paper etc. It is known to cut a paper web over a fixed edge along the full width of the paper web in an instantaneous cut. This occurs when the edge of a knife is placed across the longitudinal direction of the web and on the under side of the latter, but close to the web. On the top side of the web a hammer is placed, having great mass, which is dropped against the paper web close to the edge of the knife, cutting the paper web as it passes by.However, this method often causes uncontrolled tensions to occur in the paper at the moment of cutting. For instance when wrapping paper is put on a paper roll, the roll will, at the moment of cutting, be exposed to a temporary retardation with a subsequent acceleration when the web has been cut completely. This leads to an uneven and wrinkled wrapping of the roll. In extreme cases, especially in the case of smaller rolls, ejection of the roll may take place.By means of the present cutting device according to the invention, the above drawbacks are avoided. At the same time a cutting device that is more dependable and reliable in operation is attained, which also produces a straighter and better looking cut. When the device according to the invention is used in packaging activities, it has yet another advantage compared with previous embodiments in that when applying glue to the wrapping paper it applies glue all the way to the edge, thus avoiding a non glued flap.For instance when cutting a paper web, the adjustment of the knife in relation to the hammer is very painstaking and time consuming, and the adjustment depends on the paper quality and the condition of the paper degree of moisture , and readjustments must be made relatively frequently. This is avoided with the new cutting device, and a more continuous operation of the plant is achieved.Another advantage, though of a more environmental nature, is the fact that the the level of noise is reduced to a considerable extent.This is achieved according to the invention by a cutting device being guided from one of the outer edges of the web to the other along a course running at an oblique angle to the outer edge of the web, with a speed which in relation to the feeding speed of the web is such as to allow a right angle or approximately right angle cut. This is also achieved if the running web is under tensile stress. The cutting is performed using a cutting or slitting tool, which is guided along one side of the web, while running in a groove in a holding on tool or base table on the opposite side.The cutting device comprises a cutting tool, for instance a knife, a nail etc., a device to give the cutting tool high speed, a holding on tool or base table with a slot in it, the slot adopting an oblique angle in relation to the outer edge of the running web, and the course of the cutting tool runs parallel with the plane of the running web. The holding on tool is rotatable to and from the cutting tool for catching the advancing web, and the holding on tool is jointly constructed with a holding on tool devised to press the web against a per se known roll for glue application. A guide for the web is rotatably attached to the holding on tool for the glue application roll at the exit from the glue application roll.It is rotatable by means of a fluid power cylinder or a similar device, so as to catch the end of the web when the holding on tool for the cutting device, the holding on tool for the glue application roll and the guide have been swung away from the cutting tool, and the cutting tool is mobile by means of a fast working fluid power cylinder, for instance of the Origa type.The cutting device according to the invention is shown in the drawings, where fig.l shows a sketch in principle of a packaging machine, fig.2 shows a perspective sketch of the device, with the holding on tool in cutting position, fig.3 shows the cutting device in use in a packaging machine for paper rolls, the holding on tool being indicated in both extreme positions. For a more detailed description, reference is made to an exemplified application of the invention via fig.3. The device is made so as to act jointly with a roller battery for various widths of roll, where the different webs are guideable backwards and forwards in relation to the cutting tool.The wrapping paper is guided through the gap 1, while the holding on tool 7 is in a fully retracted position 2. The paper is caught and guided by a guide 4 and brought forward and down towards the roll that is to be wrapped. This roll is rotating at a minimum speed of at least that of the feeding speed of the paper, and the paper is applied to the roll in one or more layers always with the holding on tool in the rear position. An adjustable length of web is to have glue applied to it, which occurs by the holding on tool moving towards its second extreme position 3. The paper web is lifted by the holding on tool up towards a guide contour 5, next coming into contact with a glue application roll 6 for application of glue to one side of the paper web by means of a holding on tool 8 which is assembled with the holding on tool 7 of the cutting tool. For cutting of the paper web a fast working fluid power cylinder 9 is used, for instance an Origa cylinder, with a rider 10 connected to it which has a cutting tool 11 mounted on it, for instance a knife, nail, etc. The cutting tool passes in a slot 12 in the holding on tool, and the slot adopts an oblique angle in relation to the outer edge of the running web.After cutting, the glue application continues right to the edge of the web end that is wound on to the roll. The other web end is retracted away from the cutting device and up towards the roll battery, so that the device may optionally receive paper of a different width.The cutting device according to the invention may also be applied without the use of a holding on tool or base table to webs that are under tensile stress.
