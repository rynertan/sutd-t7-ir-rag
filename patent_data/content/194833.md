## Description
CHEMICAL COMPOUNDSThe present invention relates to novel chemical compounds, their preparation and their use, and in particular to a novel class of erythromycin derivatives. These compounds have antibacterial properties, in particular against Gram positive bacteria but also against some Gram negative bacteria, and they are therefore of use in the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and animals caused by a wide range of organisms.Erythromycin was first described in US 2 653 899 R.L.Bunch et al Eli Lilly . The structure of erythromycins can be represented as follows EMI1.1 in whichRa denotes hydrogen or hydroxy andRb denotes hydrogen or methyl.The basic erythromycin structure comprises i a 14 membered lactone ring, referred to as the erythronolide ring, numbered with unprimed digits as shown in the above formula, ii a first sugar ring, known as the desosamine ring, numbered with single primed digits, and iii a second sugar ring, known as the cladinose ring, numbered with double primed digits.The erythronolide ring can exist in two forms erythronolide A in which Ra OH erythronolide B in which Ra H .The four main naturally occurring erythromycins are as follows Erythromycin Ra Rb A OH CH3 B H CH3 C OH H D H H of which erythromycin A is by far the most important. Erythromycins, and in particular erythromycin A, are antibiotics widely employed clinically in the treatment of infections caused by Gram positive and someGram negative bacteria. A major drawback of erythromycins is their poor acid stability, resulting in poor and erratic oral absorption.Numerous attempts have been made to modify erythromycin to produce derivatives having improved acid stability without loss of the antibacterial activity. 9S 9 Dihydroerythromycin A which carries a 9 hydroxy group in place of the 9 keto group has been described, but has poor antibacterial activity P.F.

The compound of the general formula VI in which each of R4 and R9 denotes hydroxy, each of R5 and R8 denotes hydrogen, and R7 denotes methyl is erythromycin A 9 oxime or a 9 oxime ether thereof, which may be prepared from erythromycin A by known methods, for example by the methods described in the above cited references relating to erythromycin 9 oximes and 9 oxime ethers.The compound of the general formula VI in which each of R4, R5 and R8 denotes hydrogen, and R7 denotes methyl, and R9 denotes hydroxy is erythromycin B 9 oxime or a 9 oxime ether thereof and may be prepared from erythromycin B by analogous known methods.Other compounds of the general formula VI may also be prepared1 by methods known per se, from erythromycin A or B or the corresponding 9 oxime or 9 oxime ether derivative. For example, a compound in which the 4 position is substituted other than as in naturally occuring erythromycin A or B that is to say, in which R8 is other than hydrogen and or R9 is other than hydroxy may be prepared as described in the respective references cited above.In general, in the preparation of compounds of the general formula Vl, the conversion of the 9 oxo group of erythromycin A or B to a 9 oxime or 9 oxime ether group may be effected prior to or subsequent to modification of other positions of the erythromycin molecule.Prior to carrying out the reaction of a compound of the general formula VI with an alkylating agent, any reactive group of a compound of the general formula VI other than the 6 hydroxy group may optionally be protected.In particular, the 3 dimethylamino group will generally be protected by an N protecting group. TheN protection may be effected in known manner, for example by the method described by E.H. Flynn et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1955, 77, 3104 3106 .Examples of suitable N protecting groups include benzyloxycarbonyl, and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, for example, p methylbenzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl, and p p methoxy phenylazo benzyloxycarbonyl . A preferredN protecting group is benzyloxycarbonyl.It may also be advantageous to protect one or more of the hydroxy groups present in the erythromycin molecule other than the 6 hydroxy group prior to reaction. In particular, it may be advantageous to protect any hydroxy groups present at the 2 and 4 positions, especially the 2 hydroxy group. It is convenient to employ the same group to protect the hydroxy group s as that employed to protect the amino moiety, especially a benzyloxycarbonyl group.Any reactive substituents that may be present in the group R8 or R9 should preferably also be protected in a conventional manner.The present invention also provides compounds of the general formula VII, which are useful as intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of the general formula I EMI23.1 in which R4, R5, R7 and R18 are defined as above R19 denotes H or Z R23 denotes H or R3 where R3 is defined as above , with the proviso that, if R18 denotes methoxime and R5 denotes hydrogen, then R23 cannot denote methyl one of R28 and R29 denotes H, OH, OZ, NZ2, NH2, NHZ, substituted NH2, substituted NHZ, alkoxy, alkanoyloxy, or R12 502 0 in which R12 denotes an organic group , and the other of R28 and R29 denotes H, orR28 and R29 together denote oxo and Z denotes a protecting group, more particularly anN protecting group, preferably a substituted benzyloxycarbonyl group or, especially, a benzyloxycarbonyl group. In the process according to the invention, the erythromycin compound of the general formula VI, optionally containing protective groups, is reacted with an alkylating agent, that is to say, a reagent that will react with the 6 hydroxy group to form a 6 alkyl ether group including a 6 substituted alkyl ether group , OR3, suitably in the presence of a strong base and an organic solvent.The alkylating agent may be any suitable known alkylating agent, for example an alkyl iodide for example, methyl iodide or ethyl iodide , a dialkyl sulphate for example, dimethyl sulphate , or an alkyl p toluene sulphonate for example, methyl toluenesulphonate . The alkylating agent may be represented by the general formula VIII R3 X VIII in whichR3 is defined as above, andX denotes a leaving group.Examples of suitable leaving groups X include halogen atoms for example chlorine, bromine, and iodine , alkylsulphonyloxy groups for example methanesulphonyloxy , and arylsulphonyloxy groups for example p toluenesulphonyloxy . Preferably, X denotes a halogen atom, especially an iodine atom.In the process according to the invention, the reaction of the erythromycin compound of the general formula VI with the alkylating agent is suitably carried out under strongly basic conditions. Examples of suitable strong bases include alkali metal hydrides for example, sodium hydride or potassium hydride , alkali metal amides for example, lithium amide, sodium amide, potassium amide, or lithium diisopropylamide , alkali metal alkanoates for example, potassium t butoxide , and organometallic compounds for example, butyllithium .If the group R3 contains any reactive substituents, that is to say, substituents that will react under the above mentioned conditions, including, for example, some of the substituents mentioned previously for the group R3 , such substituents may advantageously be protected in conventional manner prior to reaction of the alkylating agent with the erythromycin compound of the general formula VI.The alkylation reaction may suitably be carried out in an inert solvent. Suitable solvents include, for example, N, N dimethylformamide, N, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulphoxide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide,N methylpyrrolidinone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, ethoxyethane, and 1,2 dimethoxyethane, and also mixtures of two or more such solvents.The alkylation reaction may suitably be carried out using from 5 to 10 moles of the alkylating agent and from 1 to 2 moles of the base per mole of the erythromycin compound of the general formula VI.The said reaction may suitably be effected at a cool to ambient temperature preferably at a cool temperature.The reaction may, for example, be effected at a temperature within the range of from 300C to 30 C, preferably from lOOC to 200C, especially from 5 C to 5or. If the initial erythromycin compound of the general formula VI contains a 9 oxime group, that group will react with the alkylating agent to form a 9 oxime ether. Alternatively, the 9 oxime group may first be protected by means of an ether group, so that the alkylation reaction is in fact carried out on a 9 oxime ether. Such protection may be effected in known manner using known ether forming hydroxy protecting groups, for example benzyl, substituted benzyl, tetrahydropyranyl, and trichlorethyl groups.In any event, the erythromycin compound resulting from the alkylation reaction contains a 9 oxime ether group. If the desired product of the general formula I contains such a group, no reaction need be carried out at the 9 position, although a 9 oxime ether group may optionally now be converted into a 9 oxime group or into another 9 oxime ether group. If the desired product of the general formula I contains a 9 imino group, the 9 oxime group obtained by conversion from a 9 oxime ether group may next be converted to a 9 imino group and that in turn may, if necessary, be converted to a 9 optionally substituted amino group. All such conversions at the 9 position may be carried out in known manner, for example as described in the above cited references. For example, the oxime may be converted to the imine by reaction with titanium trichloride in known manner, and the imine may be converted to the amine by reaction with sodium borohydride in known manner. Also after completion of the alkylation reaction, and prior or subsequent to any conversion of the 9 substituent, any of the groups R5, R8 and R9 may be converted to any of the other such groups within the definitions given above by methods known in the art, for example by the methods disclosed in the above cited references. For example, a compound in which R9 denotes hydrogen and R8 denotes hydroxy can be converted to a compound in which R8 and R9 together denote oxo and optionally thereafter to a compound in which R9 denotes hydroxy or acetoxy and R8 denotes hydrogen by methods analogous to those described in US 3 884 903, . cit..After completion of the alkylation.reaction, any protecting groups may be removed by a conventional method. It is often appropriate to employ a hydrogenation procedure.The hydrogenation may suitably be carried out in the presence of a transition metal catalyst, for example palladium, which may, for example, be in the form of palladium on carbon charcoal , palladium on barium sulphate, palladium on calcium carbonate, or palladium black. A favoured catalyst is palladium on carbon sometimes referred to as palladium on charcoal for example 5 , 10 , 20 or 30 palladium on carbon. A low, medium or high pressure of hydrogen may be used in this reaction, for example a pressure of from 1 to 6 atmospheres absolute, a pressure of 1 atmosphere absolute being convenient. The reaction may suitably be carried out at a non extreme temperature, for example at a temperature within the range of from OOC to 300C, preferably from 12C to 250C.It is generally convenient to carry out the reaction at ambient temperature. The reaction is preferably carried out at a pH within the range of from 4.5 to 5.0, which may be maintained by the use of a suitable buffer, for example an acetate buffer at pH 4.8.Suitable solvents for carrying out the hydrogenation include ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, ethyl acetate, a mixture of two or more such solvents, or such a solvent or mixture in the presence of water. A favoured solvent is ethanol.In order to restore the dimethylamino group at the 3 position, it is convenient to effect a reductive methylation, which advantageously may be carried out at the same time as the reductive removal of the protecting groups, as in the method of Flynn et al, op. cit,. A compound of the general formula I may be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or ester thereof in a conventional manner at any convenient stage in the manufacturing process, for example before or after the removal of any protecting groups and or before or after any conversion of the 9 substituent and or of groups R5, R8 and R9 to other such groups.Isolation and purification of a compound according to the invention may be carried out using conventional methods, and may include a chromatography step.Preferably the product is isolated in crystalline form.The compounds according to the invention, that is to say, the compounds of the general formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters, have antibacterial properties and are useful for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals, especially mammals, including humans, in particular humans and domesticated animals including farm animals .
