## Description
This invention relates to hydantoin derivatives for use in inhibiting aldose reductase activity with and new and useful hydantoin derivatives in medicinal chemistry. This invention particularly concerns the spiro hydantoin compounds with a substituted and unsubstituted fluorene ring for use in the treatment of complications arising from diabetes mellitus such as cataracts and neuropathy. Further, this invention relates to a process for the manufacture substituted spiro fluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 diones especially spiro fluorofluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 diones and spiro difluorofluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 diones. The process invention relates to the general preparation of spiro fluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 diones that are substituted in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 with a fluoro group and or spiro difluorofluoren 9 4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 diones which are substituted in a combination of the 1, 2, 3, or 4 positions and in the 5, 6, 7, or 8 positions with a fluoro group. More particularly, the invention is concerned with the preparation of dl spiro 2 fluorofluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 dione and spiro 2,7 difluorofluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2,5 dione. In diabetes mellitus certain tissues are subject to exposure to high glucose levels. In the lens of the eye, nerves, kidney, retina and other tissues is the enzyme aldose reductase. The latter is mainly responsible for the reduction of aldoses such as glucose to a polyol such as sorbitol and galactose to galactitol at the expense of NADPH. Accumulations of polyols such as sorbitol in diabetic subjects cause and or are associated with diabetic complications including those of a lenticular, reninal, neuronal and renal nature. These complications are generally known as diabetic cataract, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy respectively. Elevated polyol such as sorbitol or galactitol in the eye lens lead to cataract and loss of lens transparency. Elevated polyol such as sorbitol in the peripheral nerves interferes with normal nervous function. Aldose reductase action on elevated glucose and or galactose is also implicated in causing vasculature basement membrane thickening per se in the retinal capillaries and certain kidney tissues. Aldose reductase inhibitors inhibit the activity of aldose reductase. Hence, aldose reductase inhibitors prevent the production of polyols which directly or indirectly lead to the formation of cataracts, reduced nerve conduction function, and some diabetic vasculature pathophysiology. K. Sestanj et al. describes in US A 3,821,383 1,3 dioxo 1H benz d,3 isoguinoline 2 3H acetic acid and derivatives thereof as aldose reductase inhibitors. Further, the search for effective antidiabetic agents to prevent or arrest chronic complications such as cataracts, neuropathy and retinopathy has revealed that particular spiro hydantoin compounds are useful as aldose reductase inhibitors. Sarges, US A 4,117,230 describes a series of spiro hydantoin compounds which include the 6 fluoro and 6,8 dichloro derivatives of spiro chroman imidazolidinediones. Sarges, US A 4,130,714 describes enhanced activity of specific dextrotatory spiro hydantoin compounds such as Sarges et al., US A 4,181,728 and US A 4,181,729 describe spiro polycyclicimidazolidinedione derivatives and phenyl or phenoxy substituted spiro imidazolidinedione derivatives, respectively, which are useful to inhibit the enzymatic reduction of aldoses to prevent or reduce harmful and unwanted accumulations of polyols in the lens and nerves. Journal of the American Chemical Society, An article in J. Med. Chem, 17, pp 957 959, 1967 , by Hsi Lung Pan and T. Lloyd Fletcher discloses certain substituted fluorene derivatives which when connected through their 9 positions are spirohydantoins and when connected through their 2 positions are 4 fluorenyl 4 methylimidazolidine diones. Compounds which were specifically prepared include spiro 2 bromofluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 dione and spiro 2,7 chlorofluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 5 dione. These compounds were screened for anti tumour activity against Lewis lung carcinoma. Methythio and methylsulfinyl also called methylsulfoxyl substituted spiro chroman imidazolidinediones which are the subject of a contemporaneously filed application also are useful as aldose reductase inhibitors. With respect to sulphur containing derivatives in the instant invention, a methylsulfinyl derivative of spiro fluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 dione may be biotransformed In accordance with the present invention it has been found that compounds of the formulae Further in accordance with the present invention it has been found that the novel compounds having the formula where x is hydrogen, fluoro, methylthio, methylsulfinyl and methylsulfonyl and y is fluoro, methylthio, methylsulfinyl and methylsulfonyl and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof with pharmacologically acceptable cations may be employed as aldose reductase inhibitors for the control and prevention of sorbitol levels in the sciatic nerve and lens of diabetics, and to reduce sorbitol levels in the lens of glucosemic subjects with resulting control of diabetic complications including diabetic cataract, neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy. The pharmaceutically acceptable metallic salts can be prepared from the corresponding unneutralized derivatives using conventional methods. Treatment of a derivative with an aqueous solution of the desired pharmaceutically acceptable metallic hydroxide or other metallic base and evaporation of the resulting solution to dryness, usually under reduced pressure, will yield the salt. These compounds are unique over the prior art in that they contain a tricylic ring system which is rigid and planar in conjunction with a heterocyclic ring. The substantial increase in activity and potency of the aforedescribed tetracyclic spiro hydantoin derivatives as seen over known compounds by It will be understood that these tetracylic spiro hydantoin derivatives will contain an asymmetric center if the substitution pattern on rings A and C are not symmetric. It is known in the art that for this class of molecules, a resolved compound is more potent than an unresolved compound. For example, a 2 fluoro substitution renders the molecule asymmetric at the 9 position of the fluorene ring the same carbon atom also may be designated to be at position 4 in the spiro hydantoin ring D . A 2,7 difluoro, 2,7 dibromo, 3,6 difluoro etc., substitution pattern results in a symmetric molecule and hence no resolution is needed for an increase in activity and potency. It has also been found that tetracyclic spiro xanthene imidazolidines such as spiro 2,7 difluroxanthen 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 dione and spiro xanthen 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 dione are unexpectedly less active as aldose reductase inhibitors and are not as potent as the corresponding tetracyclic fluorene compounds of the invention disclosed herein. In accordance with the present process invention, a mono or di aminofluorene is reacted with fluoroboric acid and sodium nitrite to yield a mono or di diazonium fluoroborate salt which upon decomposition yields a mono or di fluorofluorene. The mono or di fluorofluorene is then oxidized to the ketone, a mono or di fluorofluorenone, by oxygen under basic conditions. Alternatively, this oxidation can be conducted with a more conventional oxidation method such as potassium permanganate in pyridine. This process may be illustrated as follows In accordance with this generalized scheme, 2 aminofluorene will yield 2 fluorofluorenone. This ketone, in a specific example of this generalized process, will upon treatment with ammonium carbonate and potassium cyanide in an alcohol, alcohol and water or acetamide solvent in a pressure reactor at elevated temperature with time will yield dl spiro 2 fluorofluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 dione. A specific example in the process may be illustrated as follows Step 1 of the reaction is suitably carried out in aqueous solvent at lower temperature. The temperature is critical and should be controlled to less than 10 C but above 0 C for maximum result. In step 2 of the process the decomposition of the diazonium fluoroborate salt should be accomplished in an inert high boiling solvent such as xylenes. Conversion of the fluorofluorene to the ketone in step 3 is accomplished by reacting a tetralkyl or arylalkyl trialkyl ammonium hydroxide in an aprotic basic solvent, such as anhydrous pyridine, with the fluorofluorene to facilitate oxidation by oxygen. The oxygen can be atmospheric oxygen, but better results are obtained by bubbling pure oxygen into the reaction mixture, which excludes carbon dioxide, to generate the fluorofluorenone. The resulting ketone product can be purified by distillation The ratio of reactants in step 4 of the reaction is important in the synthesis of the spiro hydantoin product from the fluorofluorenone. Better results are obtained when the molar ratio or equivalents of potassium cyanide and ammonium carbonate are 1.5x to 3x and 2x to 5x in excess of the theoretical amount. The preferred solvent is absolute ethanol and the reaction is carried out at elevated temperatures under pressure. Other polar non ketone or non ester solvents such as acetamide or ethanol diluted with water can be employed. Purification can be accomplished by diluting the reaction mixture with acid, preferably dilute hydrochloric acid, and collecting the crude spiro hydantoin precipitate. The base soluble and dimethylformamide soluble spiro hydantoin can be purified through a series of activated charcoal treatments, filtration and reprecipitation procedures.

Compounds A to U were tested for their ability to inhibit aldose reductase enzyme activity via the procedure of P.F. Kador, L.O. Merola and J.H. Kinoshita as described in It is noteworthy that Compounds L and M are as active or more active against human aldose reductase than rat aldose reductase and hence more selective against human aldose reductase than rat aldose reductase when compared to the Sarges resolved compound. These agents will exhibit more activity in humans than the Sarges resolved compound. The Sarges resolved compound shows only one fourth as much activity against human aldose reductase as compared to its activity against rat aldose reductase. It is apparent on analysis of both A. The effect of dl spiro 2 fluoro fluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 dione and spiro 2,7 difluoro fluoren 9,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 dione on the prevention on retardation of cataracts in rats was studied using the unresolved Eighty four rats were divided into the following seven groups six treated groups having different compound intake levels and an untreated galactose control having different compound intake levels as shown in Table IV. The galactose control group twelve rats, twenty four eyes were fed ground Purina Rodent Laboratory Chow, No. 5001 containing 30 by weight galactose. The six test compound groups twelve rats, twenty four eyes per group were fed the same 30 galactose chow except that the chow was formulated to deliver mg kg day of the indicated test compound see Table IV . It is known that young male rats fed a 30 galactose diet As previously described will develop lenticular changes within several days which predicatively progress in time irreversibly to cataracts. Aldose reductase inhibitor compounds which are Observations were made at days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 and 32. All rat eyes in treatment L 2 fluoro groups and M 2,7 difluoro groups were asymptomatic at the end of 32 days. All rat eyes in the Sarges groups developed snowflake like opacities without any indication of earlier vacuole formation. The average time to snowflake like opacities was 15.7 days for the Sarges Racemic 4 mg kg group and 19.7 days for the Sarges Racemic 8 mg kg group. This difference is statistically p .05 significant. Rat eyes in the galatose control group followed the usual pattern of cataract formations. The average time to snowflake was 11.5 days. This was statistically p 05 significantly lower than the average for either Sarges group. The time to cataract is summarized in Table V. The time to cataract is on the average 4 days less for Sarges Racemic 4 Mg Kg day compound than for the Sarges Racemic 8 mg kg day compound. This difference is statistically significant at the 95 probability level. Rat eyes in the galactose control group followed the usual pattern of cataract formation. The times to each type of cataract activity are summarized in Table VI. All but 3 rat eyes 12.5 developed nuclear cataracts by Day 32. The time to nuclear is estimated as 35 days for these three rats in the computation of the mean and standard deviation. At Day 32, three rats were selected and sacrificed at random from the groups treated with the racemic 2 fluoro derivative at 4 mg kg day, the racemic 2 fluoro derivative 8 mg kg day, 2,7 difluoro derivative 4 mg kg day, 2,7 difluoro derivative at 8 mg kg day and the Sarges Racemic compound at 4 and 8 mg kg day, and the dulcitol levels galactitol and galatose in the lenses were measured. The average galactitol levels for Sarges Racemic at 4 mg kg day and Sarges Racemic derivative at 8 mg kg day were 9.238 and 9.107 respectively, and are statistically p .05 significantly greater than the averages for the racemic 2 fluoro derivative at 4 mg kg day and the racemic 2 fluoro derivative at 8 mg kg day, 6.274 and 5.074 respectively, and the averages for 2,7 difluoro derivative at 4 and 8 mg kg day 2.560 and 1.399 respectively. The average galactitol levels for both doses of the 2,7 difluoro derivative are statistically p .05 less than the average for either dose of the racemic 2 fluoro compound. Both the racemic 2 fluoro and the 2,7 difluoro derivatives inhibit cataract development. The 2,7 difluoro derivative is more potent than the 2 fluoro compound. A dose response relationship is observed between the 4 and the 8 mg racemic 2 fluoro compound. B. Stock suspensions of the test compounds and all dilutions of the compound were formulated with 0.03 by weight Tween 80. Healthy, Charles River CD outbred albino, Sprague Dawley derived male rats, aged 20 30 days, without observable ocular defects and ranging in weight from 35 45 grams, were acclimated to experimental conditions in quarantine for two days prior to beginning the study. Rats were individually assigned to one of twenty three groups according to a random number schedule. Two rats, belonging to the same drug diet treatment group, were housed per cage. Treatment and control groups consisted of six 6 rats each with no replacement in the event of death, and were designated as follows Lenses of all eyes were examined with a hand held ophthalmoscope in the early stages of cataract development and a penlight for the stages, snowflake like, snowflake, and nuclear cataract. Lens grading occurred every day for the first ten study days, and then every other day until study Day 14. The test was to determine the relative efficacy and potency of the dl 2 fluoro and 2,7 difluoro compounds in terms of equal amounts of test drug per kg of body weight relative to Sarge s dl spiro 6 fluorochroman 4,4 imidazolidine 2 ,5 dione, the positive anticataract control. The relative potency determination was made at 7 drug levels over half log dose intervals. The response percent cataracts formed and or the time to cataract formation was plotted against mg kg and or moles kg. The study was directed to the suppression and or elimination of the initial stages of cataract development characterized by vacuoles or snowflake like opacities only. It was assumed therefore that suppression and or elimination of vacuoles or lens opacification by the test drugs affects the transport, absorption and or metabolism of galactose in such a manner as to prevent subsequent osmotic disturbances normally leading to tissue degeneration and advanced cataract. Advanced cataract defined as stages 2 4 of the Sipple classification was assumed to be of secondary importance to the etiology of cataract inhibition. In the event where cataract stage other than vacuole formed, such as snowflake like opacities, this cataract was counted similarly as vacuole in percent cataract formation. Studies demonstrate that 90 of young rats 50 gram fed a 30 galactose diet will develop vacuole cataracts within 5 7 days. This study yielded this expected effect in the control groups. All animals were fed Purina Laboratory Chow and water, The animals were kept on a twelve hour day night cycle. The temperature and humidity were determined each day at the scheduled dosing time of 1 00 p.m. The animals were weighed every other day and adjustments to dosage amounts to compensate for weight gain were made each day prior to the dose time. All food was routinely withheld from all animal groups for four hours 9 00 a.m. prior to the drug dose and restored two hours 3 00 p.m. post dose. Otherwise sufficient amounts of chow or diet mixture were maintained in the food hopper to allow the animals to eat All eyes were examined with a hand held ophthalmoscope and or penlight at the times designated in the Experimental Design section. It has been found in previous studies that dilation of the eye with a mydriactic i.e. Mydriacyl is not necessary for accurate grading, due to the semi transparent nature of the rat iris. In the early stages i.e., grades , The percent of eyes with vacuoles cataracts and or the time to vacuole formation were analyzed for each treatment concentration group. Since the data were sufficient, the potency of the 2,7 difluoro and racemic 2 fluoro compounds relative to the control were estimated by a probit analysis or other appropriate methodology. Additionally, the incidence of non formation vacuoles, snowflake and nuclear cataract were determined at selected time points during the study and used to compare drugs and concentration. This was done in an effort to identify an optimal endpoint for this type of study. The same data as in Table VII may be illustrated in a different format. At observation day 12, the log relative potencies for eyes with vacuoles or more advanced cataracts with their 95 confidence limits are As a further test of the efficacy of the racemic 2 fluoro and the 2,7 difluoro compound versus the Sarges Resolved compound, observation was made of the In the test, eight male Sprague Dawley rats weighing about 150 g were fasted overnight and given an injection of streptozotocin the next day. The dose was 9 10 mg 100 g of animal weight in an acid citrate buffer diluted in normal saline. The injection was given in or near the tail vein. The respective aldose reductase inhibitors the Sarges Resolved, racemic 2 fluoro, and 2,7 difluoro compounds were given to 4 of the rats at 4, 8 and 24 hours. The dose of 0.15 mg 100 g animal weight was given orally in about 5 ul of water. Each inhibitor was mixed in an erude suspension of water with a mortar and pestle. An aliquot of this mixture was then taken, using an automatic pipet and fed to each animal. On the day following the streptozotocin injection, the blood glucose of the animals was determined using the glucose oxidase peroxidase method. At 27 hours all the animals were sacrificed and the lenses and sciatic nerves were removed, weighed and homogenized. These homogenates were then analyzed for sorbitol content using the GLC method. The experimental group which was fed the inhibitor was compared with the controls not fed inhibitor and the percentage of inhibition was determined. Each value represents comparison of 4 values for control and 4 for experimental. The results of the test are shown in Table IX. D. Nerve Conduction Study In Diabetic Rats The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of the racemic 2 fluoro compound L , an aldose reductase inhibitor, for inhibiting cataractogenesis and nerve conduction deficit in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male albino rats by the intravenous injection of 50 mg kg streptozotocin. The diabetic state was verified by measuring the blood glucose level in each animal before and after injection. Diabetic animals were assigned randomly to three groups as follows 1 vehicle treated control 2 8 mg kg the racemic 2 fluoro compound L and 3 16 mg kg Sarges Racemic. A fourth group consisted of non diabetic and otherwise normal rats which remained untreated. Treatments were given once daily by oral lavage, and continued through the day prior to sacrifice of the animal. Each animal was weighed on a weekly basis. Both lenses of each animal were examined by ophthalmoscope periodically and any cataractous changes were graded and noted. At the end of 15 weeks, each animal was anesthetized using pentobarbital and the nerve conduction velocities of the sciatic nerve were measured. After an animal was sacrificed, the sciatic nerve and other tissues and organs were taken, weighed, and frozen for future biochemical analyses. Cataractous changes were graded on a scale of 0 to 4 0 denoting a normal looking lens with no changes and 4 denoting opacification involving the whole lens. The lenses of those rats in the untreated, normal control group exhibited no apparent changes and remained optically clear. Of the 32 lenses 16 rats present at the end of 15 weeks in the vehicle treated diabetic rats, 27 had a score of 4, 3 scored 3, and 2 scored 2 on cataractous changes. Thus, every lens exhibited maximal or near maximal opacity. Racemic 2 fluoro compound L was effective in preventing opacification of the lens in diabetic rats. Of 30 lenses 15 rats in the Sarges Racemic treated group, all appeared normal. Thus, both compounds were effective for preventing cataracts in diabetic rats at 8mg kg of the racemic 2 fluoro compound and 16mg kg of the Sarges Racemic compound. The record of electrical activity from the sciatic nerve in response to electrical stimulation of the nerve exhibited two inflections and two peaks, probably representing different nerve fiber groups. The effect of treatment on each of the four events was determined, and all are considered, although treatment effects appear to be greatest on the first inflection. By comparison to the normal, untreated controls, the conduction velocities determined for the vehicle treated, diabetic rats were as follows first inflection, 83 of normal first peak, 82 of normal second inflection, 80.6 of normal and, second peak, 76.4 of normal. Thus, the impairment of nerve conduction, as manifest by a reduction in velocity of conduction, ranged from 17 to 23.6 and is attributable to the diabetic state of these animals. In those rats diabetic treated with the racemic 2 fluoro compound L , the nerve conduction velocities as a percent of normal were as follows first inflection, 93.3 first peak, 88.2 second inflection, 87.4 and second peak, 85.0 . In these animals, then, the impairment ranged from 6.7 to 15 , representing an improvement by treatment of 34 to 61 . In those diabetic rats treated with Sarges Racemic, the nerve conduction velocities as a percent of normal were as follows first inflection, 88.6 first peak, 83.9 second inflection, 82.4 second peak, 79.1 . This represents an impairment ranging from 11.4 to 20.9 , indicating an improvement over controls of 9 to 33 . Therefore, both the racemic 2 fluoro compound L and Sarges Racemic produce some beneficial effect to improve nerve conduction velocity and return it towards normal. However, the racemic 2 fluoro compound L , at one half the dose of Sarges Racemic, allows a greater improvement. Statistical analysis indicates that only the improvement by the racemic 2 fluoro compound L is significant, by comparison to the untreated diabetic rats.
