# Electrographic imaging apparatus.

## Abstract
Electrographic imaging apparatus which includes a portion 1 for producing an unifixed or nonpermanent toner powder image on a first receptor 21 in accordance with electrical signals, a second portion 3 for providing a light image from the toner powder image with a third portion 2 operated to carry out an electrophotographic process for producing a permanent image on a second receptor 15 . The third portion 2 includes a photoconductive member 10 which receives the light image from the second portion 3 to provide a latent image that is developed and trans ferred to the second receptor 15 to provide the permanent image.
