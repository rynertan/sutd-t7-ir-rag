# METHOD FOR PROVIDING A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE WITH PLANARIZED CONTACTS

## Abstract
Planarized insulating layers provided with planarized contacts are formed on semiconductor devices by forming vias 34, 36, 38 through an insulating layer 30, 24 having a generally planar exposed surface, depositing a layer of a conductive layer 40 on this upper surface of the insulating layer in an amount at least sufficient to at least partially fill all of the vias, depositing a planarized layer 42 on the exposed surface of the conductive layer 40 and then etching away the planarized layer and the conductive layer by use of an etchant that removes the planarized layer 42 and the conductive layer 40 at substantially the same rate, until the generally planar upper surface of the insulating layer is exposed.
