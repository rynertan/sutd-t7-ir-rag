## Description
Corrosion Resistant Autodeposition Coatings.FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compositions for autodeposition of a corrosion resistant coating on a metallic surface0BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Autodeposition coatings can be described as those applied from acidic aqueous media containing solid polymer particles without the aid of electricity, the thickness and weight of the coating increasing with time of immersion in the coating bath see BP 1, 538,911 . The coatings result from the ability of the coating composition to dissolve from the metallic surface metal ions in amounts which cause the resin particles to deposit on the surface in a manner such that there is a continuous build up of resin on the surface.Most of the coating compositions contain hydrofluoric acid and an oxiding agent such as hydrogen peroxide BP 1, 130, 687 .After immersion in the coating bath for the required period of time the coated metal articles are usually rinsed in water and dried at 110 1500C for several minutes. Amongst the advantages for this type of coating are the low energy consumption and the fact that thicker coatings can be applied in shorter times than by other methods. Corrosion resistant coatings glossy or matt have been produced by the process by the incorporation of an acid soluble chromate or by treating the coated panel by immersion in a chromate bath prior to rinsing and drying BP 1, 559, 118 .The coatings can be pigmented using aqueous pigment dispersions, and other ingredients that can be added are surfactants and coalescing agents such as glycol ethers. A wide range of polymer emulsions have been stated to be suitable for the purpose e.g. styrene butadiene copolymers, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polytetrafluroethylene, acrylic copolymers and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers BP 1, 130, 687 andBP 1, 467, 151 and copolymers containing 1 50 of vinylidene chloride BP 1, 538, 911 and 1, 559, 118 .SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION. We have now found that high vinylidene chloride content emulsion copolymers can be used in autodeposition coating compositions to give corrosion resistant coatings without the use of acid soluble chromates although such materials may be used if it is so desired. A composition in accordance with the invention for autodeposition of a corrosion resistant coating on a metallic surface contains an acidic aqueous medium and an emulsion therein of a copolymer of vinylidene chloride with at least one other monomer copolymerizable therewith, from 70 to 95 inclusive of the weight of the copolymer being vinylidene chloride. The usefulness of high vinylidene chloride content latices on acidic metal surfaces is surprising, as soluble iron salts such as ferric chloride derived by acid attack at the metallic surface are known dehydrochlorination agents for such latices as is readily apparent if such products are stored in uncoated steel drums. The normal result of storage under wet conditions is rapid discolouration of the emulsion and discoloured coatings would be expected but this does not occur with a composition in accordance with the invention. High vinylidene chloride content preferably greater than 80 vinylidene chloride copolymer emulsions have other special properties. For example, most commercial emulsions contain two or more monomers and with respect to film properties such as elongation at break, utility as tensile strengtheners and film hardness, the contribution of each monomer is largely additive i.e. the more of a hard monomer there is in the composition the harder the film becomes. High vinylidene chloride content copolymers give anomalous film properties in relation to their second order transition point Tg of the copolymer due to the spatial symmetry of the structure SeeD.M. Woodford, Chemistry Industry, February 19th, 1966, page 316 . Moreover such high vinylidene chloride copolymers have very low moisture vapour transmission rate and low permeability to oxygen which is made use of in the packaging industry where vinylidene chloride copolymer emulsions are used as barrier coatings. These properties are important since for corrosion to occur at metal coating interfaces there must be water, oxygen and conductive ions present. Vinylidene chloride copolymers in compositions embodying the invention contain 70 95 vinylidene chloride preferably 87 93 and 5 30 preferably 7 13 of one or more of the copolymerizable monomers such as lower C. C1 8 alkyl acrylates and methacrylates and their derivatives, acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride, acrylamide and its derivatives, vinyl sulphonic acid and salts and esters thereof, acrylic and methacrylic acids or itaconic acid. Examples of the lower alkyl acrylates and methacrylates are methyl, ethyl, hexyl and ethyl hexyl e.g. 2 ethyl hexyl acrylates and methacrylates. The aqueous medium of the composition may be rendered acidic by adding an inorganic acid, for example, hydrofluoric, hydrochloric or sulphuric acid and the composition may additionally include an oxidizing agent, for example, hydrogen peroxide. The composition may be prepared by emulsion copolymerizing vinylidene chloride monomer with the other monomer s in an aqueous medium and merely adding acid to the resultant product. The composition thus obtained may be used directly in an autodeposition process. The metals suitable for coating by a composition in accordance with the invention include steel, zinc and its alloys and aluminium.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENU. A composition in accordance with the invention, its preparation and its use in an autodeposition process will now be described in more detail with reference to the following Example. EXAMPLE An aqueous copolymer emulsion was made from vinylidene chloride 90 , methyl acrylate 8 and acrylic acid 2 using sodium lauryl sulphate as a surface active agent with a mixture of sodium metabisulphite and ammonium persulphate as the polymerisation system. The emulsion formed had a solids content of 55 and the polymer a minimum film forming temperature of 15OC, An autodeposition coating bath was made from lOOg of above emulsion, l.Og 30 hydrogen peroxide and l.25g 70 hydrofluoric acid made up to 1 litre with water. A mild steel panel free of obvious surface oxidation and solvent degreased was immersed in the coating both for two minutes and when removed was heated in an oven at 1350C for four minutes. When cool the coating was clear, had a slight gloss, with good adhesion and abrasion resistance. The panel was scored through the coating and put into a salt spray apparatus for 100 hours. On examination the coating still showed good adhesion, little surface corrosion and only slight corrosion at the score marks. In contrast a similar panel coated from a bath of a conventional acrylic terpolymer emulsion for autodeposition showed a blistered, easily removable film with surface corrosion and extensive corrosion from the score marks.Examples 2 3 Coatings with similar properties to that obtained with the emulsion of Example 1 were also obtained from aqueous copolymer emulsions made from a Vinylidene chloride 87.8 , methyl acrylate 10 and acrylamide 2.2 all by weight .b Vinylidene chloride 90.4 , ethylacrylate 6.7 and methyl methacrylate 2.9 all by weight .
