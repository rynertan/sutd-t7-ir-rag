## Description
TITLE COMPATIBLE MIXTURES OF ELASTOMER IN DIGLYCIDYL ETHER OF BISPHENOL A BACKGROU AD This invention relates to a compatible mixture of a particular class of elastomers in diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A. This mixture is useful in forming anhydride cured epoxy resins having increased toughness, better heat resistant properties and higher modulus, thus producing resins useful as adhesives that are less brittle This invention also relates to a process of preparing toughened epoxy resins. It is known in the art to add elastomers to epoxy resins to increase the toughness of the resin.See for example Hammer U.S. Patent 4,157,428 especially Example 21, and Clarke U.S. Patent 3,509,230. It has now been discovered that a particular class of elastomers may be added to epoxy resins that are to be anhydride cured, and that the cured product has better heat deflection properties, increased toughness and higher modulus. It has been further discovered that when two different elastomers at least one from the particular class are used in combination in the epoxy resin the properties are enhanced to an unexpected degree. SUMMERY OF THE INVENTION The process of the present invention comprises curing in the presence of an amine catalyst, a mixture of an anhydride, and a solution of the d iglycidyl ether of bisphenol A containing at least one polymer having a melt index of 1 to 4000 g 10 minutes and the formula E X Y. Polymers of this type are described in Green U.S. Patent 3,904,588, and Hoh U.S. Patent 4,275,181. The solution may contain more than one polymer of the and aforesaid tormuia, or it may also contain a airterent polymer, i.e. carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer. The polymer having the formula E X Y is usually present in the solution in the amount of 1 to 20 by weight of the solution.The anhydride is usually present in the mixture in the amount sufficient to supply about .6 to .95 anhydride groups for each epoxy group on the ether. In the formula, E represents polymerized ethylene units, X represents polymerized alkylacrylate units or alkylmethacrylate units where the alkyl group has 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or alkyl vinyl ethers units where the alkyl group has 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or vinyl ester units of C1 to C18 alkanoic acids, or acrylonitrile units, or methacrylonitrile units, or polymerized glycidyl methacrylate units, and Y represents polymerized unsaturated mono or dicarboxylic acid units of 3 20 carbon atoms or esters of said acids, or polymerizedSO2 units or polymerized CO units. The polymer contains between 20 and 60 by weight ethylene units, between 30 and 70 by weight X units, and between 0.5 and 20 a complemental amount of polymerized Y units. The preferred polymer has Y units of ethyl hydrogen maleate. In the preferred mixture the anhydride is hexahydrophthalic anhydride. The composition compatible mixture of the present invention is that employed by the process above described. DETAILED DESCRIPTIONDiglycidyl ether of bisphenol A has theEMI3.1 tb formula tb SEP 0 SEP C1H3 SEP OH tb SEP I SEP CjH3 SEP fi tb C SEP H2 SEP SEP CH SEP CH2 SEP 10e SEP OCH2 CH CH2 SEP CH SEP OCH2 C SEP e SEP C SEP e SEP OCH2 SEP CH SEP C SEP 2 tb SEP CH3 SEP CH3 tb SEP n tb where n has an average value of about 0.2. This compound may be cured to a solid resin by the action of various chemical compounds, for example, amines, acids, Lewis acids and anhydrides. This invention is primarily concerned with improving the properties of resins made by the curing of this compound with anhydrides. Suitable anhydrides include hexahydrophthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, and phthalic anhydride. The reaction is accelerated by the addition of catalysts.Suitable catalysts include metal catalysts such as chromium acetoacetonate, amine catalysts such as 2,4,6 tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol and dimethyl benzyl amine, and amine boron trifluoride catalysts such as monoethyl amine BF3. The amount of anhydride employed and the amount of catalyst employed to obtain satisfactory cured products from the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A have been empirically determined prior to this invention a ratio of about .85 anhydride groups to 1 epoxy group is about optimum, but a range of about .6 to about .95 is operable. The amount of amine catalyst employed is usually in the range of about .2 to .8 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the mixture. The present invention is based on the discovery that by mixing at least one polymer having the formula E X Y in the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, and then curing the resin with an anhydride in the usual way that a product of increased toughness, and heat stability is obtained.Even better results are obtained when more than one polymer having the formula E X Y is dissolved in the ether of bisphenol A, and good results are also obtained when one polymer having the formula E X Y and a second polymer of carboxy terminated acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer are both dissolved in the same solution of ether of bisphenol A. If more than one polymer having the formulaE X Y is employed, it is preferred that the polymers differ in the amount of Y units present. The Y units seem to have a great deal to do with the solubility of the polymer in the ether of bisphenol A, and as the reaction of the anhydride and the ether proceeds, polymers with larger amounts of Y units tend to form very small rubber particles in the matrix, and the polymer containing fewer Y units tends to form larger rubber particles in the matrix. The size of these particles can be determined by optical microscopy and small angle X ray scattering techniques . It appears that the most desirable properties are obtained when there is a mixture of small about 0.1 to 0.01 urn range and large about 1 pm rubber particles in the matrix. Likewise it has been determined that mixtures of polymers having the formula E X Y and carboxylated acrylonitri le butadiene when dissolved in the ether of bisphenol A, yield cured products with physical properties that are superior to the results obtained when either polymer is used alone.The carboxylated acrylonitrile butadiene polymers useful herein contain about 10 to 26 by weight acrylonitrile, and are end capped with carboxyl groups to the extent that there are about 1.5 to 1.9 carboxyl groups per molecule. Such polymers have aBrookfield viscosity at 27 C of about 120,000 to 180,000 mPa S. Such polymers are sold commercially by Goodrich as Hycare rubbers. The ratio of polymers having the formulaE X Y to carboxylated acrylonitrile butadiene polymer may vary from about .5 to 1 to 1.5 to 1. It is convenient to add the polymers on an equal weight basis. Mixtures of E X Y polymers in which the Y component is present in differing amounts can also be used in about the same ratios as that set forth above. Compatible mixtures of the polymer or polymers in the glycidyl ether of bisphenol A may be obtained merely by adding the polymer to the ether, but it is faster to dissolve the polymers in a less viscous solvent such as acetone, and then add that solution to the ether, followed by mixing and evaporation of the less viscous solvent. The term compatible mixtures01 includes solutions, where the polymer is totally dissolved in the bisphenol A, as well as partial solutions, where only a portion of the polymer is dissolved in the bisphenol A. In the Examples which follow, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Examples 1 3 Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A with an epoxy equivalent weight of about 182 192 and viscosity at 250C of 12,000 to 16,000 cps was mixed at 150 C, 10 mm Hg with the copolymers shown in Table 1 below. The mixture was cooled to 900C and hexahydrophthalic anhydride was added as liquid. The mixture was degassed at 90qC, lOmm Hg.Dimethylbenzylamine was added as a catalyst and the mixture was poured immediately in molds made from aluminum plates separated by 3.25mm spacers and held together with C clamps. The molds were preheated at 150 C prior to filling. Filled molds were placed in a 79 C oven, 1 hr. and at 1500C, 2 hrs. to form cured slabs 175mm x 150mm x 3.0mm. Properties for slabs made from copolymers with different reactive termonomers, ethylene levels and melt flows are listed in Table 1. Substantially improved impact strength with slightly decreased modulus was observed in most cases.
