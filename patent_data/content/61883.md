# Device for cleaning transparent plates of detecting sections of color sorting apparatus.

## Abstract
A device for cleaning transparent plates mounted in the detecting sections of a color sorting apparatus adapted to sort granular materials such as rice according to their colors. The device has a guide rail extending in parallel with each transparent plate, a cleaning plate assembly having a wiper making a close contact with the surface of the transparent plate and movably mounted on the guide rail, and means for reciprocatingly driving the cleaning plate assembly along the guide rail. The driving means may incorporate a reversible motor fixed to the cleaning plate assembly and a roller drivingly connected to the shaft of the motor and adapted to roll on the guide rail. As the driving means operates, the wiper of the cleaning plate assembly wipes off the contami nants on the surface of the transparent plate to clean the latter, thereby to ensure stable sorting operation of the apparatus. The cleaning device may be operated optionally through manipulation of a switch or fully automatically by means of a controller incorporating a timer with a suitable period.
