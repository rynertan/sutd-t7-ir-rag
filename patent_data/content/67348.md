# Liquid level float gauge calibration means.

## Abstract
A liquid level gauge calibration means which utilizes slip clutch action between the gauge pointer shaft and the float rod. In setting the gauge range, either of said elements may be held stationary at a given point while the other element is moved to coordinate with the given point. Upon release of the element being held, the slip clutch is effective to maintain the established relationship between the two elements. A tool is used to move the slip clutch as needed for desired relative setting of the two elements.
