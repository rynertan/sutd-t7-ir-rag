# Coaxial connector plug.

## Abstract
A coaxial connector comprises a dielectric member 12 captured in an inner shell 14 . A forward part 44 of the inner shell 14 is secured within a tubular section 54 of a spring contact member 16 with leaf spring contact mem bers 58 having contact sections 64 extending axially along and spaced from a forward part of the dielectric member 12 and bent back sections 62 extending along the contact sections 64 . An outer shell 18 has a rear section 72 crimpably secured onto the tubular section 54 of the spring contact member 16 and a forward section 70 extending along the leaf spring contact members 58 with the forward end being rolled in to serve as an entrance to the connector. A center contact 20 is crimpable onto a center conductor 26 of a stripped end of a coaxial cable 24 , the crimped center contact is inserted into the dielectric member 12 , and an outer conductor 30 of the coaxial cable 24 is crimped onto a ferrule section 46 of the inner shell 14 by a crimping ferrule 22 .
