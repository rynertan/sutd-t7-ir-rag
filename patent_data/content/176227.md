# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COILING PILE WEATHERSTRIP ON A REEL

## Abstract
Two methods and apparatus for coiling pile weatherstrip 9 on a reel 1 or 2 are disclosed, so that the weatherstrip is fed to the reel under little or no tension, so that the pile is not crushed when on the reel. The weatherstrip 9 is advanced either by means of a pair of nip rollers 31,33 or by a smooth surfaced capstan 53 around which there are several turns of weatherstrip, and it is then placed on the rotating reel 1 or 2 by a head 10 on the end of an arm which can move in two different planes to place the weatherstrip in parallel adjacent rows and concentric layers on the reel 1 or 2 . The capstan is rotated at a constant speed which is such that weatherstrip is fed therefrom at a rate which is never less than the speed with which the weatherstrp passing through the head 10 is placed on the reel 2 , whereas the nip rollers 31,33 have their speed controlled by a tension sensing control roller 37 mounted on an arm 41 connected to a rotary roller speed control device 43 . This ensures that the weatherstrip is never placed on the reel 1 or 2 under tension.
