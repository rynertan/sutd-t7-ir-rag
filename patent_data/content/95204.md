# A device for feeding sheets.

## Abstract
Device for feeding at least partially overlapping sheets one by one, comprising a conveyor belt 1 which is in contact with the lowermost sheet and is driven in the feed direction of the sheets to feed the lowermost sheet, and a separator roller 8 which is driven in the opposite direction and which forms a nip together with the belt 1 to retain the sheets lying on the lowermost sheet. A displaceable member 12, 14 , for example a leaf spring wound into a spiral, presses by a flat side on the sheets approaching the nip and bears with an edge against the separator roller 8 in the immediate vicinity of the place where the sheets contact the separator roller 8 in order to prevent that these sheets, irrespective of the number thereof and irrespective of the position of the separator roller 8 , can curl or buckle.
