# Cryogenic refrigerator.

## Abstract
Acryogenic refrigerator of rotary type which comprises a generally cylindrical rotor and an expander formed about a rotor, with a plurality of radial vanes for defining about the expander rotor a series of expansion compartments which vary in volume as the rotor rotates. A regenerator is provided inside or outside and about a second axial portion of the rotor adjacent to and in fluid communication with the expander compartments. A compressor supplies compressed gas to the expander compartments for adiabatic expansion accompanied by a temperature drop of the expanded gas which is conducted through the regenerator back to the a compressor. The compressor may be of a rotary type and formed about a third axial portion of the rotor adjacent to the regenerator, with the third rotor portion being used as the compressor rotor having a plurality of radial vanes for defining about the compressor rotor a series of compression compartments which, as the rotor rotates, vary in volume in a predetermined correlation to the variation of volume of the expansion compartments. A particular construction of the expander is also provided, wherein the first axial portion of the rotor is eccentric with respect to the rotor axis, and an eccentric expander rotor is provided for rotatably about the eccentric axis, with a plurality of vanes for dividing the expansion chamber about the eccentric rotor into a plurality of compartments, each of the vanes having opposite edges hinged to the periphery of the eccentric expander rotor and one of the slides slidable on the inner circumferential wall surface of the expansion chamber, whereby as the rotor rotates, the eccentric expander rotor revolves about the axis of the machine rotor thereby to cause the expansion compartments to vary in volume.
