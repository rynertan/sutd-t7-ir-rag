# Fabricating a semiconductor device by means of molecular beam epitaxy.

## Abstract
Molecular beam epitaxy can be employed to produce a semiconductor layer on a substrate. Etching of the substrate may be necessary to prepare it for the epitaxy process, and a protective layer may advantageously be provided over the semiconductor layer after formation thereof by the epitaxy process. Such a subsidiary process of etching or protective layer formation is desirably carried out under a vacuum. Steps are taken to ensure that the substrate is maintained under vacuum during the epitaxy process and each such subsidiary process without any break in the vacuum be tween those processes, thereby reducing the danger of im purities entering the said semiconductor layer. For such etching a hydrogen plasma etching process is employed, thereby avoiding damage that could otherwise be caused to the substrate and to a vacuum pump.

## Description
FABRICATING A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE BY MEANS OF MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY The present invention relates to fabricating a semiconductor device by means of molecular beam epitaxy MBE . In the fabrication of semiconductor devices, and in particular compound semiconductor devices, semiconductor layers with different widths of forbidden bands, conduction types, or carrier concentrations are often epitaxially grown on a semiconductor substrate to form a multilayer structure. This epitaxial growth may be effected byMBE, liquid phase epitaxy, vapor phase epitaxy, including organic metal pyrolysis vapor phase epitaxy, etc. MBE allows precise control of the composition, the amount of doped impurity, and the growth rate of the semiconductor crystal layer, sharp change of the profile of the composition of a crystal layer or the amount of a doped impurity, for example a width of change of approximately 1 nm, and growth of a crystal layer with a composition different from one obtained in the state of chemical equilibrium, not possible with liquid phase epitaxy. MBE is therefore a preferred technique for forming a semiconductor crystal multilayer structure with extremely thin layers and very sharp changes of composition at the interfaces of the layers, as in a super lattice device. The surface of a substrate on which a crystal layers to be formed by MBE should be kept clean to enable full use of the above mentioned features of MBE.When the substrate is a crystal layer of gallium arsenide GaAs , the substrate can be heated in advance to remove the oxide layer formed on the surface of the GaAs layer due to exposure to the atmosphere. However, when the substrate is aluminum gallium arsenide AlGaAs , for example, the surface oxide layer formed on the surface of the substrate is aluminum oxide A1203 , a stable oxide difficult to remove by heat treatment. Such a thermally stable surface oxide layer may be removed by milling by, for example, argon Ar ions. This, however, constitutes physical etching, which can damage the surface of the crystal substrate, and therefore should not be used when fabricating, for example, a heterojunction type field effect transistor FET . In place of physical etching, use of dry chemical etching may be considered to remove the thermally stable surface oxide layer.Such etching, however, requires use of an etchant gas including chlorine Cl , fluorine F , carbon C , or the like. Such a gas may damage an extremely high vacuum pump, such as an ion pump or a cryo pump, resulting in decreased power of evacuation after, for example, three months daily use, an extremely high vacuum being essential for MBE. It may also contaminate an MBE apparatus, resulting in corrosion. Therefore, in practice, dry chemical etching with these gases is not entirely suitable for use in combination with MBE. If MBE is effected onto an AlGaAs single crystal substrate without cleaning the surface thereof, an amorphous layer will be formed on the substrate. In the case of a GaAs single crystal layer and an AlGaAs single crystal layer superposed thereon with an opening exposing the surface of the GaAs layer, MBE will not form a single crystal layer fully in the opening since an amorphous layer is formed from the surface of theAlGaAs wall since the surface oxide layer of the AlGaAs layer could not be removed. Problems also exist in the condition of the surface of a layer formed by MBE. In the conventional process for fabricating a semiconductor device, after the MBE is effected, the substrate and the crystal layer formed thereon by the MBE are cooled and then discharged from the MBE apparatus into the atmosphere before forming the semiconductor elements in and on the MBE layer. In such a prior process, heat treatment afterMBE may affect adversely the properties of an active region inMBE layers near the top surface. Such deterioration results from diffusion of an impurity into the active region. It is desirable to prevent this to maintain the excellent properties of the MBE layers. For example, MBE is often used for the fabrication of heterojunction FET s. Here, MBE is used to form a nondoped GaAs layer and then a silicon dopedAlGaAs layer on a semi insulating GaAs substrate. The interface of the GaAs layer and the AlGaAs layer is a heterojunction. An electron accumulating layer two dimensional electron gas is formed by displacement of electrons from the n type AlGaAs layer an electron supply layer to the nondoped GaAs layer. If the electron sheet concentration of the electron storage layer is controlled by a voltage applied to a gate electrode formed on the n type AlGaAs layer, the impedance of the conducting channel in the electron storage layer between a source electrode and a drain electrode is controlled. As a result, the device functions as a transistor. To form ohmic contact regions of the source and drain electrodes of such a heterojunction type FET, the following steps are often taken selectively implanting silicon ions into multiple n type AlGaAs and nondoped GaAs layers forming a surface protective layer on the n type AlGaAs layer and heating at 7000C to 8000C to activate the ion implanted regions. This type of heat treatment lowers the electron mobility, however, for example, from approximately 110,000 after MBE to approximately 70,000 cm V.sec after heat V.sec after heat treatment at 700 C for 15 minutes. The lowering of the electron mobility results from diffusion of silicon Si ions from the n type AlGaAs layer into the nondoped GaAs layer.This lowering of the electron mobility by heat diffusion of an impurity is an important problem in that it negates the effect of providing a heterojunction interface for three dimensionally separating an impurity doped layer for generating carriers and a channel layer. It is desirable to enable use of dry chemical etching in combination with MBE without damage to a high vacuum pump or contamination of the MBE apparatus. It is further desirable to prevent diffusion of impurities in a semiconductor layer formed by MBE. A preferred embodiment of one aspect of the present invention provides a process for fabricating a semiconductor device comprising the steps of etching a part of a semiconductor substrate in vacuum by hydrogen plasma growing a semiconductor layer by MBE on the etched part without breaking the vacuum and forming a protective layer on the surface of the semiconductor layer still without breaking the vacuum. A preferred embodiment of another aspect of the invention provides an apparatus for fabricating a semiconductor device comprising a first closed chamber for MBE, a second closed chamber communicated with the first closed chamber for hydrogen plasma etching a third closed chamber communicated with the first closed chamber and preferably with the second closed chamber for forming an insulating layer means for transporting a wafer among the first, second, and third closed chambers a vacuum pump for evacuating one of the first, second, and third closed chambers a hydrogen source connected to the second closed chamber for supplying hydrogen gas and a gas source connected to the third closed chamber for supply a required gas. Reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a schematic view of apparatus for fabricating a semiconductor device, embodying the present invention Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a wafer attached to a molybdenum Mo block Figs. 3a to 3f are sectional views of an FET in the steps of fabrication Fig. 4 is a sectional view of a test purpose FET manu factured by a method embodying the present invention Figs. 5a and 5b are graphs of I V characteristics of FET s in the making of which H2 plasma etching andAr milling or etching are used, respectively Figs. 6a to 6e are sectional views of an FET in the steps of fabrication Fig. 7 is a graph of electron mobility against time of heat treatment Fig. 8 is a graph of electron mobility against temperature of heat treatment and Fig. 9 is a graph of concentration of electrons in an electron storage layer. It is known that a semiconductor, for example, GaAs can be etched by hydrogen plasma R.P.H. Chang, C.C.Chang and S. Darack Hydrogen plasma etching of semiconductors and their oxides J. Vac. Soc. Technol., 20. 1 ,Jan. 1982, pp 45 50 . The inventors of the present invention took note of the fact that hydrogen gas does not damage an extremely high vacuum pump nor deteriorate a GaAs, AlGaAs, or other semiconductor layer formed byMBE and that hydrogen plasma can etch an AlGaAs or other thermally stable semiconductor layer. An embodiment of the invention can enable chemical etching of a substrate suitable for formation of a semiconductor layer on the substrate byMBE. The hydrogen plasma etching may be used not only for cleaning the surface of a semiconductor substrate formed by MBE but also for selectively etching a semiconductor substrate to form an opening, a cavity, etc.before forming a semiconductor layer by MBE. The inventors also discovered forming a protective layer such as an A1N layer on the surface of a crystal layer formed by MBE in the vacuum used in MBE prevents formation of an oxide layer at the surface of the MBE crystal layer due to exposure of the MBE layer to the atmosphere and dissociation of a component atom of the MBE crystal layer and formation of holes and other defects in the crystal during heat treatment of the MBE layer, which can prevent or decrease diffusion of an impurity in the MBE crystal layer.The inventors found that the lowering of the electron mobility of a heterojunction type FET is greatly accelerated by a surface oxide layer of theMBE layer formed between MBE and formation of a protective layer for heat treatment in the prior art, and, therefore, deterioration of electrical properties such as lowering of the electron mobility is greatly decreased by preventing formation of a surface oxide layer of the MBE layer due to prevention of diffusion of an impurity. In an embodiment of the invention, a surface protective layer is formed without breaking vacuum used in MBE. Figure 1 schematically illustrates apparatus for fabricating a semiconductor device embodying the present invention. The apparatus comprises three chambers 10, 20, and 30 for H2 plasma etching, for MBE, and for forming a protective layer, usually an insulating layer, respectively. The H2 plasma etching chamber 10 comprises parallel plate shaped electrodes 11 and 12 connected to a high frequency power source 13. An H2 gas source 14 and a vacuum pump 15 are connected to the chamber 10. The MBE chamber 20 comprises cells 21 of molecular beam sources. A shutter 22 is provided for each cell 21 to allow selection of the required molecular beam source.The cells 21 are surrounded by a shroud 23 cooled by liquid nitrogen. An extremely high vacuum pump 24 such as an ion pump or a cryo pump is connected to the MBE chamber 20. The chamber 30 for forming an insulating layer is, in this case, a sputtering chamber. Alternatively, it may be a chemical vapor deposition CVD chamber. The sputtering chamber comprises electrodes 31 and 32 connected to a high frequency power source 33, a target not shown in the figure being set on one of the electrodes 31 and 32. Gas sources 34 and a vacuum pump 35 are connected to the sputtering chamber 30. The three chambers 10, 20, and 30 are closed to maintain the vacuum and are communicated with each other through a section 40, the section 40 comprising a wafer transporting mechanism also closed to maintain the vacuum. The wafer transporting section 40 has a chamber 41 for mounting and removing wafers. A valve 42 is provided between the chamber 41 and a main chamber of the wafer transporting section 40. Valves 43, 44, and 45 are provided between the wafer transporting section 40 and the H2 plasma etching chamber 10, the MBE chamber 20, and the sputtering chamber 30, respectively. Thus, a wafer 48 to be treated can be transported between theH2 plasma etching chamber 10, the MBE chamber 20, and the sputtering chamber 30 respectively without breaking the vacuum state. Referring to Fig. 2, a wafer 48 to be treated is bonded onto an Mo block 49. This Mo block 49 is mounted on the wafer transporting mechanism, transported to each chamber 10, 20, or 30, and held on the electrode 11 or by a holder 25 or 36. The three chambers 10, 20, and 30 can be closed individually. Individual vacuum pumps 15, 24, and 35 do not necessarily have to be used, i.e., a single vacuum pump or two vacuum pumps may be used in place of the three vacuum pumps. It will be understood that an embodiment of the present invention may incorporate any conventionalH2 plasma etching chamber, MBE chamber, insulating layer formation chamber, and wafer transporting means and that the apparatus is therefore not limited to that described above. Further, an embodiment of the present invention may involve only H2 plasma etching and MBE and no formation of an insulating layer or only MBE and formation of an insulating layer and no H2 plasma etching, therefore enabling simplification of the apparatus. Below, an explanation will be given of a me Od of fabrication of a heterojunction type FET, embodying the present invention Referring to Fig. 3a, a nondoped GaAs layer 52 of, e.g., 600 nm and an n type AlGaAs layer 53 of, e.g., 100 nm are continuously formed by MBE on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 51. The n type AlGaAs layer 53 is lS 3Si doped at a dosage of, e.g., 1 x 10 cm . A silicon dioxide SiO2 layer 54 of, e.g., 300 nm thickness is deposited onto the n type AlGaAs layer 53 by a reactive sputtering process and selectively etched by a photo lithography process to form windows 55 where source and drain regions are to be formed. Referring to Fig. 3b, selective etching is conducted by using the SiO2 layer 54 as a mask to form cavities 56 passing through the n type AlGaAs layer 53 and a part of the nondoped GaAs layer 54, e.g., 300 nm thick. The wafer is then taken out of the etching chamber, resulting in contact with the atmosphere and, therefore, spcntaneous formation of an oxide layer on the surface of the n type AlGaAs layer 53 and the nondoped GaAs layer 54 in the cavity. Referring to Figs. 1 and 3b, the wafer having the cavities 56 is then mounted in the wafer transporting mechanism in the section 40, transported to the H2 plasma etching chamber 10, and fixed onto the electrode 11. The valve 43 is closed. The three chambers 10, 20, and 30 are evacuated by the vacuum pumps 15, 24, and 35.Hydrogen gas is fed to the H2 plasma etching chamber 10 through a valve not shown , the pressure in the chamber 10 being approximately 10 3 Torr. A high frequency power of 100 V, 13.56 MHz is applied to generate H2 plasma in the chamber 10 so that the exposed surfaces of the n type AlGaAs layer 53 and the nondoped GaAs layer 52 in the cavities 56 are etched with the SiO2 layer 54 acting as a mask. This etching completely removes the oxide layer at the surface in the cavities 56. The etching rate of H2 plasma etching is not so high, but it is sufficient for use in practice. After the H2 supply is stopped, the chamber 10 is evacuated again to a vacuum of approximately 10 7 to 10 Torr and the valves 43 and 44 are opened so as to transport the wafer 48 into the MBE chamber 20. The wafer 48 is fixed to the holder 25 and the valve 44 is closed. Referring to Fig. 1 and Fig. 3c, MBE is conducted to form source and drain regions 57 of n type GaAs. 10In the MBE chamber 20 of, e.g., 10 10 Torr, Ga, As, and Si molecular beams are applied from three cells 21 onto the wafer, while controlling the temperature in the chamber 20 and of the cells 21 and the wafer 48.Selectively, source gases may be supplied into the MBE chamber 20 from gas sources through pipes having valves gas source, pipes, and valves not shown in figures .The dosage of Si in the n type GaAs source and drain regions 57 is 1 x 101 cm to 2 x 101 cm Electron beam diffraction analysis confirms that the resultant n type GaAs source and drain regions 57 are of complete single crystal and that an n type amorphous layer 58 is formed on the surface of the SiO2 layer 54. Referring to Fig. 1 and Fig. 3d, the MBE chamber 20 is evacuated again to clean it. The valve 44 is opened and the wafer 48 is transported to the insulating layer formation chamber 30 in which the wafer 48 is fixed to the holder 36. The valve 45 is closed. An insulating layer 59 of silicon nitride Si3N4 is formed on the entire surface as a protective layer. For example, a target of silicon is placed in the chamber 30 and nitrogen N2 gas is fed to the chamber 30 from a gas source 34. A high frequency of, e.g., 13.56 MHz is applied at 10 3 Torr so that Ar ions are accelerated to sputter the target, depositing an Si3N4 layer on the wafer 48. The wafer 48 is then taken out of the apparatus in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. Se, source and drain electrode contact windows are opened, then source and drain electrodes 60 are formed by depositing and then patterning gold germanium gold Au.Ge Au layers. Referring to Fig. 3f, a gate electrode contact window is opened, then a gate electrode is formed by depositing and then patterning a Schottky electrode metal layer such as aluminum Al or titanium platinum gold Ti PtjAu . These processes for forming electrodes 60 and 61 are conventional. While the above explanation has the cavities 56 formed by a separate etching apparatus, they may be formed by H2 plasma etching in the chamber 10 of the apparatus in Fig. 1. In such a case, after etching, the wafer 48 can be transported directly to the MBE chamber 20 to form source and drain regions 57 by MBE, since no surface oxide layer is formed. The advantage of H2 plasma etching over Ar milling or etching can be seen from an experiment of fabricating a heterojunction type FET as in Fig. 4. This FET is fabricated by continuously growing on a semi insulating GaAs layer 70 a nondoped GaAs layer 71 of 600 nm thick 18 3 ness, an n type AlGaAs layer 72 of 1 x 10 cm 3 to 2 x 1018 cm 3 Si dosage and 30 to 50 nm thickness, and an AlGaAs cap layer 73 of 1 x 1O18 3 and an AlGaAs cap layer 73 of 1 x 10 cm 3 to 3 2 x 1018 cm Si dosage and 100 nm thickness by MBE. A gate electrode 74 is formed by selectively etching or milling the cap layer 73 in a depth of approximately 100 nm, depositing Al or Ti Pt Au layers, and patterning them. Source and drain electrode 75 are formed by depositing Au Ge Au layers and patterning them. The etching or milling process is conducted by H2 plasma etching or by Ar milling or etching, respectively.H2 plasma etching is conducted in an parallel plate type 3 etching apparatus at 10 Torr, 13.56 MHz, 100 V 50 W , and 10 nm min. Ar milling or etching is conducted in an ion milling type etching apparatus at 10 3 Torr, 500 V, and 100 nm min. The I IVDS drain current drain voltage characteristics at different VCS s gate voltage of the GS thus obtained FET s are summarized in Figs. Sa and 5b.As can be seen from Figs. 5a and 5b, H2 plasma etching greatly improved the ID IVs characteristics of the FET.This is because H2 plasma etching does not damage the active layer of the FET, i.e., the channel region 76 existing in the nondoped GaAs layer 71 near the interface to the n type AlGaAs layer 72. Below, an explanation will be given of the fabrication of a heterojunction type FET wherein the source and drain contact regions are formed by ion implantation.In this case, the problem of cleaning is not considered.Only the problem of the condition of the surface of the semiconductor layer formed by MBE is considered, so an apparatus without a chamber 10 for H2 plasma etching may be used. Referring to Fig. 1 and Fig. 6a, a wafer 48, i.e., a semi insulating GaAs substrate 80, is fixed to the holder 25, and the chamber 20 for MBE is evacuated to, e.g., 10 10 Torr. Onto the substrate 80, a nondoped GaAs layer 81 of 1 tlm thickness and an n type AlGaAs 18 3 layer 82 of 1 x 10 cm Si dosage and 100 nm thickness are formed by MBE. An electron accumulating layer is spontaneously formed in the nondoped GaAs layer 81 near the interface to the n type AlGaAs layer 82. Referring to Fig. 1 and Fig. 6b, the wafer 48 is transported to the sputtering chamber 30 and fixed to the holder 36, the chamber 30 being evacuated to, e.g., 10 10 Torr, similar to that of the MBE chamber 20. For example, the electrode 31 has an Al target, and N2 gas and Ar gas are fed into the sputtering chamber 30 from the gas sources. A high frequency power of 13.56 MHz and 500 W is applied between the electrodes 31 and 32.Thus, reactive sputtering is effected to form an aluminum nitride A1N layer 83 of, e.g., 100 to 300 nm on the surface of the n type A1GaAs layer 82. Selectively, the protective layer may be, for example, of SiO2 or S13N4. The wafer is removed from the apparatus in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 6c, a mask 84 is formed by depositing an SiOq layer and then patterning it. By using the mask 84, Si ions are selectively implanted through the A1N layer 82 into the n type AlGaAs layer 82 at 100 kV and 1 x 1013 cm Referring to Fig. 6d, the mask 84 of SiO2 is removed, for example, by hydrofluoric acid. Heat treatment is conducted, e.g., at 7500C for 15 minutes to activate the Si ions, forming n type source and drain regions 85 of a carrier concentration of approximately 3 x 1017 cm Referring to Fig. 6e, the A1N layer 83 is removed by, e.g., heated phosphoric acid. Source and drain electrodes 86 of, e.g., Au Ge Au are formed on the n type regions 85. A gate electrode 87 is formed of, e.g., Ti Pt Au. In the resultant heterojunction type FET, the electron accumulating layer has an electron concentration of approximately 5.7 x loll cm and an electron mobility of approximately 100,000 cm2 V sec. In a corresponding prior FET, the electron accumulating layer had an electron concentration of approximately 6.1 x 1011 cm 2 and an electron mobility of approximately 70,000 cm V sec. In such a FET, a protective layer of A1N is formed after the wafer is removed from an MBE apparatus. The original electron concentration and electron mobility of the electron accumulating layer 11 after MBE are approximately 5.6 x 1O11 cm 3 just after MBE are approximately 5.6 x 101l cm and 2 approximately 110,000 cm V sec, respectively.It is clear that the deterioration of the electron accumulating layer can be decreased in embodiments of the invention. The effects of conditions of heat treatment on electron mobility of heterojunction type FET s fabri cated according to a procedure similar to the above were studied. First, the heat treatment was conducted at approximately 7000C for various time periods. The results are summarized in Fig. 7, in which line A denotes FET s made using methods embodying the invention and line B those of prior methods. Second, the heat treatment was conducted for 15 minutes at various temperatures. The results are summarized in Figs. 8 and 9, in which lines A and B correspond to the FET s of line A and line B in Fig. 7 respectively. From these results, the present inventors found that, for all times and temperatures of heat treatment, the decline of the electron mobility in a heterojunction type FET is greatly accelerated by a surface oxide layer formed between the steps of MBE and forming a protective layer and that, therefore, deterioration of electrical characteristics such as electron mobility can be greatly decreased by preventing formation of a surface oxide layer of a semiconductor layer formed by MBE. While the above explanations concerned hetero junction type FET S1embodiments of the invention may also be used for other semiconductor devices. It is known thatMBE is often used in other semiconductor devices such as semiconductor lasers and photodiodes and that ion implantation is often used for forming, for example, regions of different conduction types in a layer formed by MBE in a semiconductor device. Since known photodiodes and photolasers have, in general, a thicker cap layer on an active layer than that of a heterojunction type FET, a surface oxide layer has little effect on the active layer. However, leakage current in a photodiode, etc. is increased by oxidation of the surface of a semiconductor substrate, which can be prevented in embodiments of the present invention. Further, in a reach through type avalanche photodiode APD in which a buried layer of a high impurity concentration is formed in a multiplication layer of the APD, an embodiment of the invention may be applied for a process comprising ion implantation of an impurity into a first epitaxial layer followed by growth of a second epitaxial layer. As a result, deterioration of the APD is decreased due to the prevention of formation of an oxide layer at the interface of the first and second epitaxial layers. According to an embodiment of the Invention, formation of a surface oxide layer at the surface of a grown crystal layer is prevented, resulting in decreased diffusion of an impurity in the crystal layers during subsequent heat treatment in a process for fabricating a semiconductor device
