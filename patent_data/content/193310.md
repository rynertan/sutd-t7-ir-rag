# Process for preparing unsaturated nitriles from alkanes.

## Abstract
Unsaturated nitriles, particularly acrylonitrile or methac rylonitrile, are produced in a process which integrates dehydrogenation of an alkane, particularly propane or isobutane, to the corresponding olefin, followed by ammox idation of the olefin in the dehydrogenation reactor effluent to the corresponding nitrile. After recovery of the nitrile product, the residual gases are processed to remove hyd rogen, oxygen, and carbon oxides, after which the gases are recycled to the dehydrogenation reactor. By operating with relatively low conversion of olefin to nitrile in each pass, the overall efficiency of the process is improved despite the need to recirculate substantial amounts of unreacted hydrocar bons.
