## Description
A COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR TREATING HAIR Hair waving requires the breaking, rearranging and reforring of Ireratin protein bonds which are responsible for hair configuration, such as covalent disulide bonds, ionic bonds between adjacent ionized amino acids of different polarity, and short range polar bonds, e.g. Hydrogen bonds. Rearranging ionic and hydrogen bonds can be quickly done with water, wet heat or both in conjunction with mechanical shaping devices.Unfortunately these methods produce only short term results. Permanent hair shapping can best be achieved by breang, physically rearranging and reforming the cystine disulfide bond S S linkages prevalent in keratin protein. Affecting natural hair shape by lysing the cystine disulfide linkage is referred to as softening orrelaxing the hair. Softening can be done by chemical reduction or with steam. Chemical reduction is usually preferred.once the hair nas Deen softened, or during the softening step, te nair can be artiificially shaped to a desired configuration. The reducing chemicals are then neutralized or washed from the hair, followed generally by an oxidation step to regenerate disulfide linkages between the same or previously unconnected cysteine moieties. Reformation of cystine disulfide bonds or other sulfur based intrachain protein linkages is sometimes referred to as hardening. These new cystine disulfide bonds permanently maintain the hair in the shape it was given during the softening and hardening steps. hair softening cnericals are generally called hair waving agents, though the sane agents may be used to straighten hair as well. At present, one of the most widely used types of hair waving and straightening compositions are the sulfur based cold wave solutions.Their name is derived from the fact they can provide good wave or straightening action at low e.g. room or moderate temperatures, rather than requiring the use of steam or high temperatures during the softening process. Almost all cold wave solutions contain a reducing agent comprising sulfur containing chemical, most commonly thiol substitued acids, aldehydes and alcohols or bisulfite salts and sulfates. A conventional method for utilizing such solutions is to treat the hair with a solution containing one of these reductive ingredients at alkaline pH, forming the hair into the desired configuration and then treating it with a so called neutralizing solution or an oxidizing reagent such as a bromate, perborate, or hydrogen peroxide to effect reformation of sulfide bonds. This method enables satisfactory perranent hair shapes to be formed at room temperature. Among the thiol substituted corpounds, thioglycolic acid salts are the most frequently used cold waving agents. However, these particular acid salts or other thiol acid salts, even though they can be used at low temperature, exhibit several problems from the standpoint of hygiene and safety even when used under strictly controlled conditions and in optimized amounts. Waving solutions based on thioglycolic acid frequently emit a strong unpleasant sulfur based odor due to the presence of mercaptan compounds. This odor is a nuisance to cosmetologists and users.Also, thioglycolic acid salt based waving solutions only provide good cold wave perranents at a pH of 8.0 or above, which requires the use of an alkaline substance to adjust pH. However, te adjustment of pH, usually done with ammonia, increases the unpleasantness of the sulfur based odor and the ammonIa, or any other base, may cause irritation and sensitization upon contact with the skin. Alternate room temperature active hair softening composItIons based on the sulfite or bisulfite moiety are known. Sulfite and bisulfite based solutions exhibit lower acute toxicity and lessened reaction with human skin in relation to thioglycolic acid based compositions. An early U.S. patent to J. Speakman, number 2, 201, 929, discloses the use of sulfites as softening agents in solutions at pHs ranging from 4 through 11, preferably at pH 11. Variations of Speakman s original sulfate and bisulfite cold wave solutions have been proposed. For example, there is a British Patent No.591,936 to J. Speakman disclosing the addition of 15 to 45 alcohol to such sulfite and bisulfite cold wave lotions. The replacement of alkali sulfites and bisulfites with the sulfites of organic bases, such as monoethannolamine, ethylenediamine,, and morpholine are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,437,965 to E. Michaels. ,n addition, sulfite based cold wave lotions containing sulfocyanate and diethylene glycol ethers are disclosed in French Patent No. 1,076,766 to J. Scandel bisulfites and urea and urea derivatives, for example, thiourea, formamide, acetamide, di and triacetamine are disclosed in French Patent o. 1,039,222 and different glycol ethers such as Cellosolve, Carbitol, dioxane, and trioxane in combination with sulfite and bisulfite are disclosed in French Patent No. i,073,465. Tnese various additives are all acclaimed to intensify the hair setting action of the sulfite bisulfite combination.Each is most effective at a pH above 6 and requires the use of some user applied neutralizing or oxidizing chemical other than water as an after treatment. Other bisulfite based hair setting compositions have been proposed, some requiring no special after treatment other than a water rinse. For example U,S. patent No.3,966,903 discloses a hair wavIng composition which comprises a sulfite and bisulfite waving agent and an alkylene carbonate or alpha or delta lactone accelerating agent, requiring only water rising t effect the hair set. These solutions are effective in a pH range from 6 to 9. U.S. Patent 4,038,959 discloses a hair treating composition comprising a bisulfite salt and a mink oil based quaternary ammonium salt conditioning agent. This composition is effective below pH 7, preferably 6.5 6.9. A neutralization step is optional. In another instance, hair shampoo for increasing hair body is disclosed in U.S. Patent o, 4,243,659. This composition comprises a bisulfite salt, urea derived swelling agent, an auxiliary swelling agent which is a polyhydroxy alkyl solvent and a cationic conditioner adjusted to a pH between 4.0 to 6.9, preferably 6.0 to 6.6. See also U.S. Patent 3,912,808 and U.S. patent 2,836,185 which disclose bisulfite reducing agents for treating hair in combination with amine polymers and swelling agents such as water soluble, nitrogen containing compounds of the amaze class. U.S. Patent 3,227,615 discloses the use of water soluble bisulfite and a water soluble cationic polyamlde epichlorohydrin resin for the permanent waving of hair. A monograph on sulfite cold waving and hair straightening, authored by W. R. Markland, can be found in Norda6 Briefs, No. 493, July A.ugust 1979. All these references disclose systems which include a second reducing chemical and or recommend the use of a neutralizing or oxidizing agent as an after treatment in order to stop the reduction reaction and to achieve an acceptable permanent wave. While these systems work well, the ideal and most convenient hair waving system would be one which requires only the application of a reducing com csition buffered to the pH of hair, shaping of the hair, application of low to moderate heat, and water rinsing to effectuate the set. It is the object of tis invention to provide a hair treating composition which is optimally active at the normal pH of hair, is effective at low to moderate temperatures and does not require the subsequent application of a neutralizing or oxidizing solution. One aspect of this invention is an aqueous hair treating composition which comprises a water soluble bisulfite salt, a water soluble, alkyl substituted betaine or quaternized amido amine cerived cationic penetrating agent and a water soluble organic acid salt maintained at a pH between .0 and .0. The composition optionally includes a buffering agent and an antioxidant. Another aspect of this invention is a process for treating hair, which process comprises applying the above described composition to hair for â time sufficient to effect hair treatment with low to moderate heat and then rinsing the hair wit water. There is disclosed herein a hair treating composition which gives unique and surprising hair treating results. The optimum activity of these compositions occurs at the normal pH of hair. Low to moderate temperatures will readily effect the reduction process. No after treatment other than a water rinse is required to effect permanent hair treatment. Hair may be waved or straightened by applying this composition to hair, shaping the hair either by curling or straightening while applying low to moderate heat, and after an appropriate period of time, rinsing the hair with water.No further treatment is needed or required to impart a suitably long lasting and manageable permanent shape to the hair. For te purposes of this invention the phrase hair treating should be understood to include curing or waving, straightening, training and any other treatment which gives the hair a desired configuration by means of treatment with the subject compositions in accordance with the process discussed below. Permanent refers here to the situation where the hair retains its post treatment configuration even after a large number of washings or wettings with non reductive materials. Water soluble bisulfite salts are the reducing agents in these unique compositions They are convenient and safe chemical agents for reducing cystine disulfide linaes and are actIve at low to moderate temperatures, which In this instance refers to temperatures which vary between about 25 to 500C. They are essentially odorless and can be formulated into stable systems at an acid pH.In proper concentrations, the subject bisulfite salts do not exhibit dermatological toxicity or sensitization. The full range of water soluble bisulfite salts may be used in the practice of this invention. For the purposes of this invention it is most convenient, and therefore preferred, to use a sodium, potassium, ammonium or alkanolamine salts, for example, mono, di or triethanolamine bisulfites. Sodium bisulfite is the most preferred reducing agent herein. Alkali metal metabisulfites, which hydrolyze to bisulfites in water, may also be used though they are not preferred over sodium bisulfite. The anhydrous form of sodium bisulfite usually is supplied as sodium metabisulfite. The instant compositions will contain between 5.0 and 15.0 eight weight percent of bisulfite salt, preferably in an amount of 10 . These figures apply to all water soluble bisulfite salts having utility herein regardless of the cation. The second and a seminal component of this composition is a water soluble organic acid salts A water soluble organic acid salt means the salt of a carboxylic acid function containing, hydrocarbon deerived compound which is sufficiently water soluble to give a functional concentration and which, at the concentration employed, exhibits no untoward or deleterious dermatological effects. Such salt surprisingly has been found to materially and substantially encance the hair treating activity of the composition. By adding an appropriate amount of such salt, the bisulfite salt based composition is rendered effective in a p range 1 lower than previously practiced wit bisulfite salt based hair treating compositions. F rther, the presence of this salt reduces reatment time and temperature requirements. Hair texture, feel and strength are also enchanced by addition of this salt.Without this salt, a bisulfite salt or bisulfite salt cationic penetrating agent hair treating composition does not provide the long lasting permanent or acceptable hair qualities seen when the salt is present. Water soluble organic acid salts in general will function in this invention so long as they have the requisite water solubility and are non toxic. Water solubility will vary depending on the organic acid selected and the counter ion. While there may be instances where one salt form will not demonstrate the requisite solubility, such will not foreclose the use of other salts of that acid. Additionally, while preferred and most preferred concentration ranges are set out infra, a salt need not be water soluble over the full concentration range in order to come within the scope of this invention. It will be sufficient for this invention if a particular salt is water soluble at the lower limit of the preferred concentration range. For the purposes of tis invention, water soluble organic acid salts include the salts of simple organic acids such as the formates, acetates, propionates and the like dl or triacid salts, such as oxalates, talonates, succinates and citrates mono or polyhydroxy substituted organic acid salts, for example glycolates, lactates, citrates, glucoronates, ascorbates and the like and aryl acid salts such as benzoates. This is an exemplary list of organic acid salts and it should not be taken as limiting of the organic acid salts which can be used in the practice of this invention. Only water solublity and cosmetological toxic.t are limiting herein. The cation ray be a metal, an amine, or an alkyl or alkanolamine and the like, so long as the salt has the requisite water solubility. Acid salts will most commonly be the sodium, potassium or ammonium salts. For the practice of this invention it is preferred to use an acetate salt, most preferably sodium acetate. Organic acid salt concentrations may vary between 0.5 and 20.0 weight weight percent w w , most preferably in an amount between 1.0 and 10 . The composition of this invention also contains a water soluble, alkyl substituted betaine based or quaternized amido amine based surfactant. While numerous cationic surfactants are known to act as penetrating agents, it has been found that only the described compounds are efficacious in combination with the other two seminal components. Anionic, nonionic, amphoteric and like surfactants were found to have little or no effect on the hair treating activity of the water soluble bisulfite organic acid salt composition. The general formula for the alkyl substituted betaine surfactant is EMI9.1 wherein R1 is a saturated or unsaturated long chain fatty acid radical of 12 to 20 carbon atoms and R2 and R3 represent a short straight or branched chain alkyl or hydroxyalkyl radicals of I to 4 carbon atoms. The most preferred surfactant of this type is the one according toFormula A wherein R2 and R3 are both hydroxyethyl and R1 is derived from the fatty acid complex called tallow. Tallow is defined in the CTFA Cosmetic IngredientDictionary Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association as the fat from fatty tissue of Seep or cattle. It consists primarily of fatty acid glycerides The highest grace o beef tallow is called oleo tallow.It contains as glycerides oleic acid 37 43 , palmitic acid 24 32 , stearic acid 20 25 , myristic acid 3 6 , linoleic acid 2 3 with additional minor constituents such as cholesterol, arachidonic, elaidic, and vaccenic acids This preferred surfactant is designated bis 2 hydroxyethyl tallow ammonium ethanoate or, by theCTFA Dictionary, dihydroxyethyl tallow glycinate.It is commercially available from Miranol Chemical Co., Inc.,South Brunswick, New Jersey, 08810, under the trade nameMirataine TM Other examples of alkyl substituted betaine derived cationic surfactant penetrating agents are lauroamphoglycinate and sodium trideceth sulfate commercially available as Miranol MHT from Miranol Chemical Co., Inc. , cocamidopropyl betaine commercially available as lego betain L 7 from Goldschmidt ChemicalCorporation, Hopewell, Va. , cocoamphocarboxyglycinate commercially available as Mlranol C2M from MiranolChemical Co., Inc. , coco betaine commercial available as Standapol AB 45 from Henkel, Inc., Teaneck, N.J. , lauroyl sarcosine commercially available as Hamposyl L from W.R Grace Co, organic Chemicals Division,Nashua, N.H. , and cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine commercially available as Lonzaine CS from Lonza, Inc.,Fairlawn, N. J. . Alternatively, there may be used water soluble quaternary aido amine of Formula B EMI11.1 wherein R4 is a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid hydrocarbon radical of 12 to 20 carbons and R5 through R8 are alkyl radicals of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or hydrogen. Other examples of water soluble quaternary amido amine derived surfactants include laurylpyridinium chloride commercially available as Dehyquart C fromHenkel, Inc. , stearalkonium chloride commercially available as Ammonyx 4002 from Onyx Chemical Company,Millmaster Onyx Group, Jersey City, N.J. , isostearylethyl imidonium ethosulfate commercially available as Schercoquat IIS from Scher Chemical Company, inc. , ricinoleamidopropyl ethyldimonium ethosulfate commercially available as Lipoquat R from LipoChemicals, Inc., Patterson, N.J. , quaternium 27 or tallowamido ethylimidazomonium methosulfate commercially available as Carsosoft S 75 from Lonza, Inc. , and olealkonium chloride commercially available as Alacsan 7LUF from Alcolac, Inc., Baltimore, Md. . Most preferred is the compound according o Formula B wherein R4 is the isostearyl fatty acid radical, R5 is propyl, R6 is methyl and R7 and R8 are ethyl, being the compounnd N,N dimethyl N ethyl N 3 isostearyl amidopropyl ammonium ethyl sulfate. Its CTFA Dictionary designation is isostearamidopropyl ethyldimonium ethosulfate. Such material is available from the ScherChemical Co., Inc., Clifton, New Jersey, 07012, under the trade name Schercoquat I S LC. These penetrating agents may be used singly or in combination in amounts between 0.1 and 3.0 weight weight percent w w . preferably the total amount of penetrating agent will be 0.25 to 1.5 w w . It has surprisingly been determines that cationic surfactant penetrating agents having a molecular weight below about 1000 are best for facilitating penetration of the cuticle and retention in the hair shaft with the compositions of the present invention. These compositions are adjusted to a pE of between 5 and 6, preferably between 5.3 5.5. It is important to maintain the pH of these compositions within a pH of 5 to 6 for several reasons. First, this pH range maximizes the reducing capacity of the composition secondly, this pH range stabilizes the composition and thirdly, the normal pH of hair falls in this range. Blsulfite ion is the most effective cystine disulfide bond reducing agent v s a vis the sulfite ion.Below pH 6 bisulfite ion is the only species present while above that pH the solution represents an equilibrium between bisulfite and sulfite ions. Stability considerations indicate It is desirable to maintain this pH range. Below pH 5, this tripartite composition is unstable. After several days at room temperature it gives off noxious fumes and shows a concurrent decrease in activity. However, adjusting the pH to above 5 .0 greatly improves composition stability and long term efficacy. Since the normal pH range of hair is 5.3 5.5, it is most desirable to treat hair at this pH in order to minimize adverse affects to the hair. This pE range also is less lIkely to sensitize or irritate the scalp or other skin which may come in contact with the composition. The instant aqueous solutions will normally have an acid pH, usually within or very close to the preferred range. However, it is best to monitor the pH during the formulation process and make an appropriate adjustment with acid or base as the last formulation step. If pH adjustment is needed, a dilute solution of acid or base is best used. Any com osition compatible acid or base may be used for this purpose. If the p9 must be lowered it is preferred to use the acid form of the organic acid salt for this purpose. Where the pH must be adjusted upward, the most frequent case, ammonium hydroxide or an alkanolamine are the preferred alkali materials. Other nitrogen derived bases, alkaline earth metal hydroxides and the like will serve this purpose equally well. It is the adjustment of pH which is of significance here, not the particular acid or alkali used Although not required, it is preferable to include a buffering agent in these compositions to stabilize the pH within the preferred range.Such materials, weak acids and their salts, must have some buffering capacity in the preferred pH range and be compatible with the other composition materials. Depending on the chosen water soluble organic acid salt, that salt can be incorporated into the composition as one of the buffering agent components. An acetate salt acetic acid buffer system is exemplified hereinafter, and is the preferred buffering agent for this invention where such is employed. Other weakly acidic systems with some buffering capacity in the preferred pH range will function equally well. The total percentage of buffering material, when present, should be in the range of 0.01 to 2.0 by weight weight of the total composition.Where the buffer system is an organic acid salt combination wherein the salt is first an active ingredient as discussed above, the amount of acid will be present in accordance with the 0.01 to 2.08 range, but the amount of salt present will conform to the functional range noted alcove fo an organic acid salt as an active ingredient. Antioxidant reducing agents may be added to these comoositlons if desired. They will serve to improve the composition s stability and can indirectly assist in maintaining p7R. Any suitable compatible antioxidant useful in pharmaceutical or cosmetological compositions can be used. Erythrobic acid and ascorbic acid, for example, can be used for this purpose. An antioxidant will be present in an amount of about 0.1 to 0.3 weight weight percent. Further, if it is desired, perfumes and the like may be added to these compositions so long as they do not adversely affect the hair treating activity of the composition. The process for treating halr according to this invention comprises applying the subject compositions to hair by some convenient means, shaping the hair and resaturating it with solution if desired, followed by the application of low to moderate heat for some time sufficient to effect hair setting. Following these steps, a water rinse will complete the treatment process. The amount of solution required to effect hair treatment is not exact. However the hair should be well wetted, if not saturated, in order to realize to the fullest extent the hair treating activity of these compositions. If the hair is not fully wetted, the sulfide bond reduction will not be maximized, which can result in less stable permanents. These compositions can be applied to dry or wet hair, but it is preferred to first wash the hair and then apply the instant compositions while the hair is still wet. The compositions can be applied as a spray, as droplets, or placed on some mechanical device such as a comb and applied to the haIr thereby. Generally a more even distribuIon of the corposition can be achieved by applying the composItion to a comb and combing it into the hair, or by corking the hair after the composition has been applied as a spray or droplets. While it is usual to apply such solutions before shaping the hair, the solution may be reapplied once the hair is on mandrels, in order to insure complete and adequate wetting. After the hair has been wetted and shaped, a plastic bag or some other non porous material should be placed over the hair to keep it moist during the treatment period. Heat is not required to effect a good permanent wave with these compositions, but the use of moderate temperatures will expedite the process. A preferred practice of this invention will include the application of some heat to the hair after it has been wetted.Temperatures should not exceed 50 C. A temperature less than this is more than adequate to insure proper and complete hair treatment. Preferably, a temperature of 40 to 450C will be used. The amount of time for effecting hair treatment is that time which is sufficient to effect a long lasting permanent hair set. Because the proper amount of time will depend on the hair type, condition of the hair, the degree of hair wetting with the subject compositions and the processing temperature, only a general time range can be specified. The exact time will be determine by the user based on his or her skill and knowledge of the several noted factors. It has been found that, generally, the hair treating process will not require more than 60 minutes and usually is completed in 15 to 30 minutes, especially when moderate heat is applied. However it should be understood that because hair treatment is dependent on a variety of factors, for a given head of hair, a good rerranent may be realized in less than 15 minutes. Following the reduction step, hair need only be rinsed with running water and dried to effect a set to the hair. Usually the hair will be rinsed while still on mandrels or other shaping device. Several minutes of thorough water rinsing, about 5 minutes or so, generally removes all residual bisulfite organic acid surfactant material. The hair can then be removed from the shaping device and dried or, for a more curly hair shape, dried on the shaping deviCes, at the choice of the user. The following examples further illustrate the present invention. EXAMPLE I A hair treating composition was prepared by conventional procedures, comprising TABLE I Ingredient Amounts Sodium bisulfite 10.0 g Isostear midopropyl ethyldimonium ethosulfate 0.5g Acetate buffer 20.0m1 sorbic acid 0.5g Deionized water q.s. 100 g Acetate buffer Sodium acetate 220g Glacial acetic acid 20ml Deionized water q.s. 1 liter Forulat ion on x s carried out by first dissolving the cationic surfactant in 90 of the deionized water with stirring. Next was added the sodium acetate and antioxidânt with stirring, followed by the sodium bisulfite.After all materials were dissolved, the pH was adjusted to 5.3 with 1090 ammonium hydroxide, after which water is added In a quantity sufficient q.s. to bring the composition to total weight 100 g . EXAMPLE II This Example factor illustrates the hair treating process of the present invention. Natural brown hair was given a permanent wave using the composition of Example I as follows Hair was shampooed once with a mild acidic cleansing shampoo, rinsed thoroughly and toweled dry.While the hair may be slightly wet or dry, the moisture content should be even. Solution was applied directly to one section of the hair at a time with combing through for even distribution. Small, thoroughly saturated sections of hair were then wound on mandrels. After all sections had been wound, each section was resaturated with solution. The hair was covered with a plastic bag and air preheated to between 400 and 50 C was applied.Processing required between 15 and 30 minutes. After processing, the hair was rinsed with warm running water while still on the mandrels for at least 5 minutes. A towel was used to blot dry the hair and the hair allowed to rest several minutes before the rods were removed to give a natural looking soft wave style. A curly hair style can be obtained by drying the hair with heat befcre removing the rods. Alternatively, hair may be set on rollers in a conventional manner after rod removal.
