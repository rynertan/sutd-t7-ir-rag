# PRODUCTION OF OXYGEN ENRICHED AIR

## Abstract
A pressure swing adsorption process is provided for the direct production from ambient air of a moderately enriched oxygen product gas. The production of a product gas having an oxygen concentration of 23 to 30 is effected by a three step cycle wherein 1 the feed air is charged to a bed of ni trogen selective adsorbent until the bed is brought from at mospheric pressure to a pressure in the range of up to 4 at mospheres, 2 reducing the bed pressure to an interme diate level by withdrawal of oxygen enriched product gas therefrom and 3 finally venting the bed to restore atmo spheric pressure. By an alternative mode including a fourth step of purging the bed following the venting step, a product of 23 to 45 oxygen concentration is obtained.
