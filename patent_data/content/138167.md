# Method for purification of HBs antigen.

## Abstract
A method for purification of HBs antigen, which com prises treating an HBs antigen containing material with an acid, optionally subjecting it to salting out with ammonium sul fate, and subjecting the material to a chromatography with hy droxyapatite, by which a highly purified HBs antigen suitable for the preparation of HBV vaccine or diagnostic agent can be obtained in an industrial scale. This method is particularly use ful for the purification of HBs antigen containing material pro duced by recombinants obtained by DNA recombination tech nique.
