# A METHOD OF PREPARING A POLYAMIDIC FIBER SUITABLE FOR STAPLE SPINNING, AND FIBER OBTAINED THEREBY

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a method of preparing a suitable fiber for staple processing and having good mois ture absorption characteristics. The method consists of preparing a copolymer of Nylon 6 and poly 4, 7 dioxydecamethylene adipamide containing 10 to 40 by weight of the latter component, spinning said copolymer by melting at a temperature in the 246 C to 300 C range and extruding through a die having capillaries with larger diameter dimensions than those used in the standard polyamide staple spinning, cooling the filaments by blowing air, hot drawing the filaments in air at a draft ratio in the 2.2 to 3.6 range, effecting a heat setting operation under tension, at least the final step of the heat setting operation being effected at a temperature close to the softening temperature of said filaments, and subjecting the resulting filaments to a mainly antistatic type of finish. The invention also relates to the polyamidic fiber thus obtained.
