# Vibration responsive mounting arrangement for automotive engine or the like.

## Abstract
The expansion contraction timing of an actuator cham ber 46 is varied in accordance with the sensed engine vibration in a manner as to compensate for the frequency dependent change in pressure transmission characteristics between the chamber 46 of the actuator 38 and the chamber 28 of an engine suspension insulator 10 . This is done by sensing the engine vibration frequency or a parameter which varies in accordance with same e.g. RPM and suitably delaying a solenoid or similar electric motor energization signal in accordance with the frequency of the vibration.
