# HEAT GENERATING DEVICE AND ITS APPLIED SYSTEM

## Abstract
This invention relates to a heat generating device and its applied warming or drying system which utilizes the air friction heat generated within a sealed chamber at reduced balanced pressure. This device comprises at least two of the sealed chamber connected in series, and a control means for reducing the current supplied to a rotary means of the sealed chamber when the reduced balanced pressure is achieved in the chamber. The device further comprises a connecting chamber with a plurality of heated air discharging slits for connecting the outlet of the preceding sealed chamber in air flow and the following sealed chamber, and or an opening degree adjusting member for reducing the inlet opening of the sealed chamber when the reduced balanced pressure is achieved, thereby improving heating efficiency and saving energy.
