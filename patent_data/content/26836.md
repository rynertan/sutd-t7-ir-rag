# Ink jet printer.

## Abstract
The ink contamination of an ink jet printer at start up and shut down is avoided by moving the gutter 50 from its normal operational position along the flight path of the ink droplets to a position immediately adjacent to the nozzle plate 28 of the printer. The charge electrode 52 and the lower deflection electrode 54 are moved out of the path of the gutter 50 as it is moved towards the nozzle plate. The charge electrode 52 is fixed to the upstream end of the lower deflection electrode 54 . The down stream end of the lower deflection electrode is pivotally mounted on a shaft 56 carried by one end of an arm 58 which can pivot about a shaft 60 . The gutter 50 is disposed adjacent to the downstream end of the lower deflection plate and can be moved in a direction perpen dicular to the plane of the lower deflection plate.
