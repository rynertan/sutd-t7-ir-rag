# PROCESS FOR RECOVERING ADSORBENT FOR USE IN EXTRACORPOREPROCESS FOR RECOVERING ADSORBENT FOR USE IN EXTRACORPOREAL CIRCULATION TREATMENT AL CIRCULATION TREATMENT

## Abstract
A process for recovering the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for use in extracorporeal circulation treatment, wherein polyanion compound is immobilized on a water insoluble support, characterized by that the adsorbent after adsorption is washed with an aqueous electrolytic solution with a concentration of 0.18 to 6 mole â„“. According to the process of the present invention, the adsorbent after adsorp tion can be recovered quickly and simply with sufficient safety and the recovered adsorbent for use in extracorporeal circulation treatment has almost unchanged selectively and saturated amount of adsorption, which also lower the cost of treatment
