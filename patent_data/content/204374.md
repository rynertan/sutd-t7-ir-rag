## Description
The present invention relates to novel tripeptides having hypotensive activity, useful for the management of the hypertensive states. From the technical and patent literature peptides having a considerable hypotensive activity on animals and on man are known. EP A 0148133, in the name of Polifarma, discloses a class of tripeptides having hypotensive action, characterized in that the N terminal α aminoacid is pyroglutamic acid Glp , and the C terminal α aminoacid is L tryptophan Trp , whilst the second aminoacid is selected from those present in nature. To the purpose of obtaining novel tripeptidic compounds provided with pharmacological activity, we have modified the aminoacidic sequence of the tripeptide known, by replacing, either contemporaneously or separately, L pyroglutamic acid with L proline or L proline bearing a substituent group on its amino group, and L tryptophan with L phenylalanine or L tyrosine. By so doing, tripeptides have been synthetized wherein the N terminal α aminoacid is an L proline Pro , an L proline Pro.R bearing a substituent group on its amino group, or pyroglutamic acid Glp and the C terminal α aminoacid is an L phenylalanine Phe , L tyrosine Tyr or L tryptophan Trp , and with the limitation that, when the N terminal α aminoacid is Glp, the C terminal α aminoacid is different from L tryptophan, and when the C terminal α aminoacid is L tryptophan, the N terminal one is different from Glp. The compounds so synthetized have been analyzed in order to verify the relationship between the aminoacidic structure of the tripeptide and the presence of a biological activity. in which R₁ is a straight chained acyl group having up to 9 carbon atoms, a benzyloxycarbonyl group, or an alkoxycarbonyl group The tripeptides I of the present invention are synthetized, according to known techniques, in solid phase, by using a polymeric matrix insoluble and swelling in the reaction medium, onto which the individual aminoacids are linked according to the desired sequence. The tripeptide thus formed is then separated from the resin by treatment by a suitable reactant. In particular, the polymer used for the synthesis of the tripeptides of the present invention is constituted by small spheres of polyamidic resin suitably functionalized with residues of substituted benzyl alcohol according to the method by R. Arshady et al. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I 529 1981 . The resin is then activated by treatment with 1,2 diaminoethane and is reacted with fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl norleucine Fmoc NLeu ₂O Fmoc is removed by treatment with piperidine in dimethylformamide and is finally submitted to acylation by 2,4,5 trichlorophenol p hydroxymethylphenoxyacetate. The suitably protected aminoacids are activated to symmetrical anhydride before being linked to the so modified resin. In particular, the synthesis is carried out by reacting the protected aminoacid with N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in methylene chloride, at a temperature of 20 25 C for a time of about ten minutes. At the end, the precipitated dicyclohexylurea is filtered off from the reaction mixture, the organic solvent is evaporated off, and the symmetrical anhydride formed is separated. The protective groups suitable to the purpose are selected from those known in the art. In particular, for the α aminic group, as the protecting group fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl is selected, whilst for the groups possibly present in side chain, groups based on tert.butyl are selected hence, tert.butyl ester for the carboxy functions, tert.butoxycarbonyl for the aminic functions, and tert.butyl ethers for the hydroxy functions. The first aminoacidic residue, activated to symmetrical anhydride, is linked to the resin by forming an ester bond with the substituted benzyl residue. The residue of substituted benzyl alcohol is selected in such a way that, by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid, at the end of the synthesis the separation of the peptide from the resin may be obtained with high yields. It is known however that aminoacidic residues having an aromatic function of phenolic or indolic type on branched chain undergo, during the acidolytic removal with trifluoroacetic acid, an electrophile attack on the aromatic ring by the benzylic carbocation produced. Such a reaction causes unavoidingly a decrease in yield during the step of peptide separation from the resin. It has been hence found that overcoming this drawback is possible, by using, during the end step of separation from the resin of the peptide containing residues with aromatic side chains in C terminal position, ethanedithiol mixed with trifluoroacetic acid, with a volume ratio of 1 9 between the two compounds. At the end of the removal reaction, the resin is filtered off from the reaction mixture and peptide containing solution is freeze dried, a fluffy, colourless residue being obtained. The desired peptide is then isolated from said residue with yields of from 53 to 78 by reverse phase high pressure preparative chromatography, using Lichroprep RP 18 20 40 µm Merck as the solid phase, and an aqueous mixture of CH₃CN and trifluoroacetic acid as the eluant. The identity of tripeptides is confirmed by protonic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis ¹H N.M.R. . The purity of the compounds synthetized is tested by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis RP HPLC , using a Perkin Elmer chromatograph with Hibar An elution with linear gradient from 20 of A to 65 of A over a 25 minutes time has been used. The purity of tripeptides synthetized is furthermore checked by thin layer chromatography TLC on silica gel, using the following eluant systems n butanol acetic acid water 4 1 1 BWA and chloroform methanol acetic acid 85 10 5 CMA . The hypotensive action of the tripeptides of the present invention has been tested on the arterial pressure of normotensive male rats of C.D. strain, available from Charles River Co., of weight of 200 300 g. The rats have been anaesthetized by ethyl urethane 1.75 g kg by intraperitoneal way , and, after tracheal cannulating, the right hand carotid artery has been isolated and connected by cannula to a Hewlett Packard Model 1280 pressure transducer. From isolated left hand carotid artery the arterial flow has been recorded by means of the Biotronex On Hewlett Packard Model 8824 C polygraph, the pressure variation with time dp dt , the electrocardiogram ECG and the beats per minute BPM have been recorded. The so tested compounds cause a gradual and long lasting hypotensive effect which reaches, at the dose of 0.2 mg kg, a delta for diastolic arterial pressure of from 30 mm It has been furthermore found that the daily dose per kg of body weight, referred to the pure compound, is preferably the following The purpose of the invention shall be clearer after the reading of the following Examples, which are merely illustrative and in no way must be considered as limitative of the same invention. 1 g of polymeric support, constituted by small spheres of polydimethylamide co acryloylsarcosine methylester crosslinked with N,N ethylene bis acrylamide is activated by treatment with 1,2 diaminoethane.
