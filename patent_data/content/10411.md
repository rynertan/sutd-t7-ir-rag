# Method for preparing an elastomeric urethane urea copolymer and a composition for preparing same.

## Abstract
An elastomeric urethane urea copolymer is prepared by reacting an isocyanate terminated oligomer or prepolymer with as chain extending agent an aromatic diamine wherein each amine group is bonded to a carbon atom of an aromatic carboxylic ring the reaction is performed in the presence of a quaternary ammonium catalyst of the general formula R ₄N OR¹ wherein the R groups may be the same or different and each R is chosen from hydrogen with the proviso that not all R groups are hydrogen , alkyl containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, hydroxyalkyl containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkaryl and aralkyl, wherein the alkyl portion of any alkaryl or aralkyl group contains from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and R¹ is hydrogen, alkyl containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms or phenyl. The composition for preparing the copolymer comprises 1 the oligomer or prepolymer and 2 the aromatic diamine and 3 the catalyst.
