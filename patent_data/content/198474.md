## Description
The present invention relates to bacterial plasmids carrying the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region, but lacking sequences encoding the hepatitis B core antigen, which are used for transfection of eukaryotic cell lines for production of particles containing polypeptides encoded by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region. Recent advances in genetic engineering have made it possible for a number of peptides and proteins to be expressed in bacteria, yeast as well as mammalian cells, in increased amounts. Though many proteins and peptides have been expressed in considerable amounts in bacteria, it is a special desire to express large amounts of those proteins and polypeptides which are to be used in human medicine in mammalian cells in order to avoid drawbacks asso ciated with any contaminating products resulting from the bacterial cell, or from expression in bacterial cells. Of special interest is the expression of hepatitis B surface antigen proteins in increased amounts in mammalian cells. The expression rate of these polypeptides in mammalian cells has so far not been high enough to allow an economic production thereof. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted among humans and causes a chronic and debilitating infection that results in severe liver damage, primary carcinoma and death. In most cases, complete recovery from hepatitis B infection can be expected. However, in many African and Asian countries, hepatitis B virus infection is endemic. A large number of individuals in the populations of these countries are chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus and thereby have the dangerous potential of further transmitting the disease. Vaccination is the only known protection against hepatitis B virus. Recently several companies for example, Merck, Sharp and Dohme, U.S.A., and the Pasteur Institute, France have introduced a plasma derived vaccine against hepatitis B virus. The vaccine contains, as the antigen, hepatitis B viral proteins which are normally located on the envelope of the viral particle. Such antigen is commonly referred to as the hepatitis B virus surface antigen HBsAg , and the viral gene encoding such antigen is called the HBsAg gene. The above referenced vaccines contain surface antigen isolated from the plasma of hepatitis B virus infected humans. Although the surface antigen itself is not pathogenic, it stimulates the production of antibodies that are directed against hepatitis B virus particles in human beings. The only commercially available source of hepatitis B surface antigen is the blood of hepatitis B virus infected humans. The isolation and purification of the surface antigen from human serum is a cumbersome and time consuming process and is, therefore, relatively expensive. In addition, as long as the human serum is the only commercially available source for surface antigen, the amount of surface antigen available for use in vaccines, will be limited. For large scale vaccination, especially in areas where hepatitis B virus is endemic, it is of great importance to have a cheap and virtually unlimited source for surface antigen of hepatitis B virus. Because of the potential danger of contamination with pathogenic agents when surface antigen is taken from human serum, it is desirable to avoid the use of human serum as a source for surface antigen. There is also no biological system known besides human beings and chimpanzees in whch hepatitis B virus can grow and be propagated. Recent advances in molecular biology have made it possible to clone the sequence of the complete genome of hepatitis B virus Siddiqui, A. et al, Following these advances, several host systems have been tested for the expression of that portion of the viral genome encoding the surface antigen proteins of hepatitis B virus. It has been demonstrated in many cases that bacteria can provide a cheap production system for certain eukaryotic products. However, many difficulties are observed when eukaryotic products are synthesized in bacteria. For example There have been problems with hepatitis B surface antigen made in bacteria. First of all, the production rate in bacteria is very low and, in addition to this, the purification has to start from a bacterial lysate because the product is not secreted from the bacterial cell. Another problem arises from the fact that certain post translational processes do not exist in bacteria, for example glycosylation of the surface antigen which has an influence on the level and specificity of the immune response. For any of these reasons it is desirable to avoid bacteria as production hosts. Yeast cells transformed with an appropriate recombinant vector containing the hepatitis B surface antigen coding sequence synthesize and accumulate said surface antigen in considerable amounts in yeast culture. But there are some serious drawbacks in this host system, too, i.e., 1 the surface antigen is not secreted from the yeast cells and has to be isolated from a cell lysate of such cells, and 2 the surface antigen monomers made in yeast cells form no covalently joined dimers, unlike the surface antigen secreted from mammalian cells. There have been several attempts to establish mammalian cell lines that produce surface antigen. These cell lines have been derived from human hepatocellular carcinomas Alexander, J.J. et al, A number of references discuss the expression of polypeptides synthesized by the hepatitis B virus coding sequence. European Patent Application Publication No. 013,828 A1 EPA 013,828 , published August 8, 1980, states that nucleotide sequences encoding a 163 amino acid stretch the PreS coding region immediately preceding the S protein coding region in the HBV genome, may also be included in the fragments employed to produce useful recombinant DNA molecules for production of polypeptides displaying hepatitis B virus surface antigen antigenicity. In addition, it is described that gene fragments including both the precursor sequence and the structural gene for HBsAg may be excised by the use of one or more of a variety of restriction endonucleases prior to or during construction of a cloning vector. Furthermore, it is described that the 163 codon precursor preceding the structural gene coding for HBsAg should be excised from a cloning vehicle containing the S protein coding sequence prior to using the vector for transformation. European Patent Application Publication No. 072,318 82 EPA 072,318 , published February 16, 1983, describes a method of making HBsAg by growing yeast cells transformed with a vector including a yeast replicon, a yeast promoter and a DNA segment coding for the S protein and specifically excluding the 163 codon precursor preceding the structural gene coding for HBsAg. A vaccine including an HBsAg antigen and a method of obtaining an HBsAg antibody by purifying the antibody from the serum of animals immunized against HBsAg is also described. A 14 to 18 nm antigen particle capable of forming an immune complex with HBsAg antibody is also described. In Feitelson et al, Laub et al, Takeda Chemical Ind., Japanese Patent Application No. J5 8194 897 A, published November 12, 1983, Takeda I , describes an HBV DNA Gerlich, in a presentation at the European Association of Clinical Microbiology in Bologna, October 18, 1983, reported that four potential genes of HBV have been deduced from the DNA sequence of cloned HBV DNA that the gene for the surface proteins S gene of HBV consists of one uninterrupted coding sequence which is translated into at least three polypeptides that the sequence of the major protein, P24, and its glycosylated form, GP27, begins with the third conserved translational start signal of the S gene that the minor surface proteins, GP33 or GP36, begin at the second start signal, that only the P41 polypeptide of HBV probably uses the full length coding sequence of the S gene that P41 carries a major antigenic determinant of HBV and that it is present only in the complete viral particles but not in the 20 nm particles of surplus surface antigen from which the current hepatitis B vaccines derive. There is no report in Gerlich specifically regarding the PreS₁ region of P41 or that the PreS₁ region specifically contains an antigenic determinant which would be useful in an HBV vaccine. Stibbe et al, Stibbe et al, Neurath et al, Heerman et al, Michel et al, Cattaneo et al, Persing et al, Milich et al, Neurath et al, Valenzuela disclosed, at the May 15, 1985 Bio Expo 5 Meeting in Boston, expression of the entire PreS₂ protein coding sequence in yeast that such yeast cells do synthesize a particle containing both HBsAg and PreS₂ peptide which is very similar in electron microscopy and sedimentation properties to particles containing only HBsAg, and that the PreS₂ region does not interfere with the ability to form the 22 nm HBsAg particles. Valenzuela also states that it has been hypothesized that HBV gets into the liver by binding polyalbumin to its polyalbumin receptor which in turn binds the polyalbumin receptor in the liver cell and thus, the virus gets internalized. The polyalbumin receptor of HBV is encoded by the PreS₂ region. Valenzuela concludes that a vaccine containing PreS₂ will elicit antibodies which, in addition to inactivating HBV through the normal mechanism, might interfere with the way the virus enters liver cells. See, also, Valenzuela et al, Valenzuela et al, Neurath et al European Patent Application Publication No. 0,154,902 A2, published September 18, 1985, describes a hepatitis B vaccine containing a peptide with an amino acid chain of at least six consecutive amino acids within the PreS gene coding region of the envelope of hepatitis B virus. The vaccine is free of an amino acid sequence corre sponding to the naturally occuring envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus and the physiologically acceptable diluant. The peptide is free or can be linked to a carrier.

By the term transcription is meant that process carried out by the host cell biosynthetic machinery, including RNA polymerase complexes, that, using one of the two complementary DNA strands as a template, polymerizes ribonucleotides in a sequential fashion, 5 to 3 , 3 to 5 with respect to the DNA template strand to yield an exact copy of one of the DNA strands, but containing ribonucleotides instead of deoxyribonucleotides. By the term transcription termination sequence is meant that region within the DNA molecule, designated By the term polyadenylation is meant the process by which the host cell biosynthetic machinery recognizes a specific sequence, usually, 5 AATAAA 3 , designated PAS, for polyadenylation signal, within the RNA molecule and that directs the addition to the 3 end of said molecule some 15 20 nucleotides downstream in the direction of the 3 end of a non template determined polyriboadenylate moiety, specifically added by the enzyme poly A polymerase. By the term selection marker is meant a gene determinant that, when expressed in the cell, confers a specific set of characteristics upon the cell that allows such a cell to be distinguished, or selected out, from other cells not carrying or expressing said gene determinant.

A primary reason for using a non replicating vector system in eukaryotic host cells is that all vector systems capable of autonomous and extrachromosomal replication in a mammalian host eukaryotic cell transfected therewith comprise replicons which are derived from oncogenic viruses. It is desirable to employ vectors comprising DNA not derived from oncogenic viruses for expressing DNA sequences encoding polypeptides of pharmaceutical imortance, such as the proteins coded for by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region. The vector of this invention comprises the MMT promoter. The MMT promoter is a non viral, strong transcriptional promoter.

This invention also relates to the particles prepared by such method. If the transfected host cell of this invention secretes such particles directly into the culture medium, such particles can then be isolated from the culture medium of the transfected host of this invention by conventional protein isolation techniques. If the transfected host cell of this invention does not secrete such particles, they are obtained from a culture lysate of such host by conventional culture lysate techniques. Such particles are obtained in glycosylated form and are composed of proteins coded for by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region, including at least one protein coded for by the entire PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region. This invention also relates to a vaccine comprising an immunoprotective amount of the particle of this invention.

The particle of the subject invention contains no viral DNA components and therefore is free from undesirable side effects commonly found in naturally derived vaccines, such as unintentional infection with the virus, allergic reactions, fevers, and the like. The vaccine of the present invention comprising an immunoprotective amount of the particles of this invention can be used to improve the HBV immune response and to overcome non respon siveness to hepatitis B virus vaccines which do not include proteins coded for by the entire PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding sequence.

A vaccine against hepatitis B virus can be prepared using said lipid vesicles comprising the polypeptides of the present invention. The lipid vesicles in the appropriate concentration can be used as a vaccine with or without adjuvant, such as aluminum hydroxide. The particles of the vaccine of this invention can be employed with a physiologically acceptable diluant medium , such as phosphate buffered saline. The vaccine of this invention, comprising an immunoprotective amount of the particles of this invention, can be prepared and used in the same general manner as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,118,479, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The vaccine can be administered by subcu taneous, intradermal or intramuscular injection. While the preferred route would depend on the particular vaccine, it is believed that intramuscular injection is generally more suitable. Frequency of administration will vary depending upon the vaccine.

One diagnostic test includes the following Particles of the present invention coded for by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region can be employed as a diagnostic tool to detect antibodies to the PreS₁ PreS₂ S regions of HBV surface antigen proteins in a given sample. The PreS₁ PreS₂ S containing particles are adsorbed on a solid substrate containing binding sites thereon, for example, polystyrene beads. The substrate is thereafter contacted with a substance, for example, gelatin, BSA or powdered milk, to saturate the non specific binding sites thereon. Thereafter, the substrate is washed with a buffered solution and thereafter the buffer is removed. A specimen, such as human serum, diluted with animal serum, is added to the substrate. The resulting mass is then incubated and washed. Thereafter, radio labeled, such as iodinated ¹²⁵I , antibodies to human IgG or IgM is added to the mass. The resulting mass is incubated then washed and counted, such as in the gamma counter. If the count is higher than the count obtained for the normal serum control, the specimen contains antibodies to the PreS₁ PreS₂ S coding regions of HBV. The above procedure for detection of antibodies to the proteins coded for by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region of HBV is believed to be applicable as a diagnostic tool in detecting hepatitis B virus infection. A diagnostic test kit for detecting antigens coded for the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding regions of the HBV genome in a test sample would include the following Another diagnostic test kit for detecting antibodies to the proteins coded for by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region of the hepatitis B virus genome in the test sample includes the following Radio labeled antibodies used in the above described test kits can be packaged in solution form or in lyophilized form suitable for reconstitution. In addition, enzyme linked or fluorescent labeled antibodies can be substituted for the described radio labeled antibodies. The above described test kit and process for detecting antibodies to the PreS₁ PreS₂ S coding region polypeptides of hepatitis B virus can be utilized in applications such as detecting HBV infection in a patient by taking serum from the patient and applying the above described test or using the above described test and predicting recovery from HBV infection by taking serum from an infected patient and applying the described antibody detection procedures. The test procedures and test kits for antibody detection can be used for making qualitative comparisons between different HBV vaccines by taking serum from vaccinated patients and then utilizing the above described test procedures or kits for antibody detection.

Such particles are isolated in glycosylated form and are composed of proteins coded for by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region, the PreS₂ S protein coding region, and the S protein coding region. This invention also relates to a vaccine comprising an immunoprotective amount Preferably 1 20 ug of the particles produced by the co transfected host of this invention. The particle produced by the co transfected host of the subject invention contains no viral DNA components and therefore is free from undesirable side effects commonly found in naturally derived vaccines, such as unintentional infection with the virus, allergic reactions, fevers, and the like.

Sterile medium is stored at 40 C prior to use. 0.5 g l trypsin 0.2 g l EDTA tetra sodium in Hank s Balanced Salt Solution Since EDTA was found to be toxic for Vero cells, EDTA free trypsin solution is used with these cells. The following enzymes are used The concentration of total protein in preparations of purified particles of this invention is determined using the Bio Rad protein assay kit. This method utilizes the Bradford assay, a spectrophotometric means of measuring Coomassie Blue binding to protein. Ovalbumin is used as a standard. In the NML RIA 125 I sandwich radioimmunoassay, beads coated with mouse antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen anti HBs are incubated with serum or plasma and appropriate controls. Particles containing polypeptides encoded by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region are bound to the solid phase antibody. After aspiration of the unbound material and washing of the bead, human ¹²⁵I Anti HBs is allowed to react with the antibody antigen complex on the bead. The beads are then washed to remove unbound ¹²⁵I Anti HBs. The radioactivity remaining on the beads is counted in a gamma scintillation counter. Specimens giving counts per minute cpm greater than or equal to the cut off value determined by multiplying the negative control mean count rate NCx by a factor are considered reactive. Cells are grown to 100 confluency in a T75 flask. The culture medium is then replaced with 5 ml of methionine free medium containing 400 uCi of L ³⁵S methionine and 400 uCi of L ³⁵S cysteine NEN for overnight incubation. The medium is concentrated 10 fold by fractional precipitation with polyethylene glycol. Concentrated protein about 10⁶ cpm is incubated with 10 µl of pre immune guinea pig serum or with 1 and 10 µl of anti HBsAg guinea pig serum in 50 µl of TEN 10mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1mM EDTA, 130 mM NaCl 0.5 Tween 20 for 1 hour at 37 C.

Thereafter, the ligation mixture was filled up with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, to a total volume of 70 µl and added to the 200 µl bacterial cell suspension for DNA take up. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 minutes, then 1 ml L broth was added and the mixture was incubated at 42 C for 2 minutes and at 37 C for 40 minutes. After the incubation, the cells were spread on agar plates containing 50 µg ampicillin ml agar at volumes of 50 µl up to 300 µl of the cell suspension per plate. The agar plates were incubated at 37 C overnight. After this incubation period, single isolated bacterial colonies were formed. e.

The filter is incubated in this mixture for 4 hours at 45 C, after which the pre hybridization mixture is replaced by the hybridization mixture 50 formamide, 5 SSC, 20 mM Na phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 Denhardt s solution, 100 µg ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 5 10⁵ cpm ml ³²P probe. The filter, after incubating in the hybridization mix for 18 hours at 45 C, is washed three times, 5 minutes each, in 0.1 SSC, 0.1 SDS at 50 C. The filter is dried at 60 C for 10 minutes and exposed to two X ray films XAR 5, KODAK between two intensifying screens and kept at 80 C. The first X ray film is developed after 3 days exposure the second film after 7 days exposure. Hybridization of the labeled DNA probe to one of cellular DNA restriction fragments from transfectants which produce particles of this invention demonstrates that the cellular DNA does in fact contain the integrated vector of this invention. Since the cellular DNA restriction pattern, as elucidated by the Southern blot procedure, is identical to that of the original plasmid construct, no major rearrangement of plasmid DNA occurred upon integration into the host cell DNA. Cells are transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Wigler et al Tissue culture dishes 100 mm diameter are innoculated with 5 10⁵ cells and incubated overnight at 37 C. Four hours prior to transfection, the culture medium is replaced with fresh medium. DNA to be transfected is suspended in 1 ml of solution containing 250 mM NaHPO₄. This calcium phosphate DNA precipitate is added to the cells in culture. After an overnight incubation, fresh medium is added to the cell culture and the cells are incubated for an addition two days. An ampule of cells held at 196 C in liquid nitrogen is thawed quickly by placing the ampule in a 37 C water bath for 5 minutes. One ml of the freshly thawed cell suspension is diluted by slowly adding 10 ml of the appropriate culture medium. Thereafter, the cells are harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of culture medium. Thereafter, the cells are harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of culture medium, transferred to a T25 culture flask, and grown in an incubator at 37 C and 5 CO₂. With these conditions, the doubling time is in the range of 15 to 20 hours for L cells and CHO cells, and 30 to 40 hours for Vero cells. L cells and CHO cells can be kept alive and growing beyond 100 confluency, whereas Vero cells are passaged at 100 confluency. Cells are maintained in T75 or T150 flasks containing DMEM 10 FBS. Roller bottles 850 cm² are innoculated with 10 15 10⁶ cells harvested from T flasks. After 3 to 5 days of growth, approximately 10⁹ total cells are harvested from six roller bottles and used to innoculate six hollow fiber cartridges HFC s in an ACUSYST P made by Endotronics, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minnesota U.S.A. After innoculation, the HFC s are inserted into the ACUSYST P culture system, and the medium flow rate through the cartridges is adjusted to and mintained at 50 ml hr. Medium is assayed daily for pH, pO₂, glucose and lactate. After 2 to 3 weeks of growth, a 600 ml fluid volume is harvested two times weekly from the extracapillary space of each ACUSYST P hollow fiber cartridge. Production of particles of the subject invention is assayed by the radioimmunoassay RIA . Since freezing destroys RIA assayable activity, harvests are stored at 4 C prior to purification. No protease activity can be detected under these conditions as assayed by Azocoll substrate proteolysis SIGMA . a. b. The stock of the Hoechst 33258 bisbenzamide fluorochrome solution is made by dissolving 5 mg in 100 ml PBS using a magnetic stirrer. It is sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 um membrane stored in the dark at 4 C, and diluted a thousand fold with PBS before use. The medium from coverslip cultures, which are 50 70 confluent, is aspirated from the cells and fixed with two changes of ethanol acetic acid 3 1 at 4 C. Following one wash with deionized water and incubation for 30 minutes at 37 C with diluted bisbenzamide fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 , the coverslips are rinsed with deionized water. The coverslips are mounted, cell side down, on a slide using a glycerol mountant 22.2 ml 2.1 citric acid 1 ml H₂O 27.8 ml 2.8 Na₂HPA₄ 50 ml glycerol pH 5.5 . 1 2 In another group, 10 adult mice are also innoculated. Each animal is innoculated with 0.5 ml cells intraperitoneally and 0.03 cells intracerebrally. The animals are observed for four weeks and any that become sick or show abnormality is examined to establish the cause of illness. Results of the tests in animals for the presence of contaminating viruses indicate no viral contamination. d. For the purpose of this test, a progressively growing tumor is defined as a palpable nodule that increases in size over the 21 day observation period and that shows viable and mitotically active innoculated cells when examined histologically. The presence of microscopically viable cells in association with a stationary or regressing nodule is not considered a progressively growing tumor. Medium from the extracapillary space is harvested from the ACUSYST P culture system and pooled into volumes of 3000 ml. To each volume, 180 g of PEG 8000 SIGMA are added, dissolved by stirring at room temperature for 20 minutes and stirred for another 3 hours at 4 C. The precipitate is collected by centrifugation in 500 ml bottles in a GS 3 rotor at 4500 rpm 3000 g for 30 minutes at 10 C. The supernatant is collected and 180 g of PEG 8000 are again added and dissolved at room temperature as described above. The solution is stirred at 4 C for an additional 3 hours. The precipitate from this solution is collected as described above except that centrifugation is performed at 9000 rpm 15,000 g for 60 minutes. The pellet is resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate buffered saline PBS . The material obtained after PEG precipitation, and redissolved in PBS, is submitted to gel filtration chromatography using BioRad A 5m resin at 4 C. Column dimensions are 25 1000 mm, and the bed volume is 480 ml. In a typical fractionation run, 1000 µg of PEG precipitated particles of this invention in a volume of 10 to 15 ml is loaded and eluted with PBS or TNE at a speed of 6 drops minute 18 ml hr in fractions of 3 ml. Figure 6 shows the profile of RIA assayable material eluted from an A 5m column. The solid line indicates the 280 nm absorbance of each fraction, and the dots indicate amount of material calculated from the RIA results. About 30 fractions covering the first peak resulting from gel filtration column chromatography and containing partially purified particles of this invention are pooled approximately 100 ml . This solution is adjusted to a density of 1.30 g cc with CsCl and subsequently transferred to mitrocellulose tubes fitting into a SW 27 28 rotor Beckman . Gradients are set by underlaying 4 ml of a CsCl solution of 1.35 g cc and by overlaying 4 ml of 1.25 g cc and 4 ml of 1.20 g cc density. Gradients are run at 28,000 rpm for 50 hours at 10 C, fractionated, and the purified particles in the 1.20 g cc density layer at the top of the gradient Figure 7 is collected. Purified particles are well separated from the small amount of contaminating protein banding in the middle of the gradient. The solution was desalted by dialysis, first against water, then against 3 changes of saline, over a 24 hour period. As a further quality control measure, a portion of this gradient purified material is submitted to linear CsCl gradient centrifugation. A single peak of purified particles appears as expected at 1.2 g cc. In order to prepare an adjuvant of the vaccine of this invention, 1 10,000 volume Thimerosol, and 1 10 volume of filter sterilized 0.2 M Al K SO₄ ₂ 12 H₂O are added to the desired concentration of antigen in sterile saline. The pH is adjusted to 5.0 with sterile 1N NaOH and the suspension is stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The alum precipitated antigen is recovered by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm, resuspended in sterile normal saline containing 1 10,000 Thimerosol, and aliquoted under sterile conditions. To determine the stability of the particles of this invention absorbed to alum, the antigen was recovered by resolubilizing the alum in 3 sodium citrate followed by successive dialyses against 3 sodium citrate and PBS. The quantitiy of particles of this invention is then determined by parallel line radioimmune assay against dilutions of a purified HBsAg standard in PBS 50 newborn calf serum. Samples two each of bulk and alum absorbed Sample Concentration 5 µg ml Storage Container glass vials Storage Temperature 2 8 C Tests a Qualitative SDS PAGE b Quantitative Radioimmunoassay The plasmid pBPV342 12 was digested with the restriction endonuclease The reaction was performed in a total volume of 400 µl of reaction buffer see Materials and Procedures at a final concentration of 0.2 µg µl pBPV342 12 DNA and 80 units of The preparation and cloning of the HBV genome, subtype The DNA fragments generated by this reaction were separated by 1.5 agarose gel electrophoresis. The 2.78 kb size From a DNA solution prepared as described under part A. above, 1 µl was taken and mixed with 5 µl of the 2.78 kb The mixture was submitted to a ligation reaction at a total volume or 10 µl of reaction buffer containing 0.9 units of T4 DNA ligase at 15 C for 1 hour and at 4 C overnight. Bacterial cells, preferably HB101, were made competent for taking up DNA in a transformation reaction according to the method described in Materials and Procedures. The ligation mixture was made 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, in a total volume of 70 µl and added to 200 µl competent bacterial cell suspension for DNA take up. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 minutes, then 1 ml L broth was added and the mixture was incubated at 42 C for 2 minutes and at 37 C for 40 minutes. After the incubation, the cells were spread on LB agar plates containing 50 µg ampicillin ml at volumes of 50 µl up to 300 µl of the cell suspension per plate. The agar plates were incubated at 37 C overnight. After this incubation period, single isolated bacterial colonies were screened for the presence of the pMMT neo bacterial plasmid containing the desired 2.78 kb Screening was preferentially performed by the colony hybridization procedure. For this procedure, single colonies were picked with a toothpick and transferred to an LB ampicillin containing agar plate in a grid format to allow identification of the clones. The plate was incubated overnight at 37 C. The colonies were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter by layering the filter on the agar surface until the filter was wet. The filter was quickly peeled off and sequentially transferred to three layers of Whatman 3M paper, each of them either soaked in 0.5 M NaOH, or 1 M Tris, pH 7.0 1.5 M NaCl 0.5 M Tris, pH 7.4, or 2 X SSC. The filters were placed on the soaked paper, colony side up, during the lysis of the cells and the following neutralization and fixing procedures. After the filters were dried in air, they were baked at 80 C in vacuum. Thereafter, the nitro cellulose filters were submitted to DNA hybridization with a radioactively labeled DNA probe made from the 2.78 kb The nitrocellulose filter was incubated in a pre hybridization mix containing 50 formamide, 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6 1 X Denhardts solution 100 µg ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 1 10⁷ cpm ³²P labeled DNA which was melted in 0.2 N NaOH at 68 C for 10 minutes. The filter was incubated in this mixture for 16 hours at 45 C. Thereafter, the filter was washed twice in 2 X SSC, 0.1 SDS, for 5 minutes each cycle at room temperature and twice in 0.1XSSC, 0.1 SDS, for 15 minutes each cycle at 50 C. The filters were exposed to an X ray film preferably 3M between two screens at 80 C for two days. Colonies containing the recombinant plasmid carrying the cloned 2.78 kb The plasmid pDM1 described above was submitted to complete digestion with the restriction enzymes The DNA was removed from this filter by incubation in high salt for 4 hours at 4 C and purified by phenol chloroform extraction and two ethanol precipitations. The DNA was resuspended in 20 µl of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.8. One µl was checked for purity and estimation of quantity by agarose gel electrophoresis. The large 5.1 kb fragment containing the metallothionein promoter at the Because the large fragment also contains the bacterial plasmid, it is possible that self ligation of this fragment will propagate itself without incorporating the small size The pelleted DNA was resuspended in 10 µl 10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, of which 5 µl was taken as a control and checked for self ligation and another 5 µl was mixed with 5 µl of the electroeluted small 1.4 kb Twelve single colonies were picked and grown in 2 ml cultures and the plasmid DNA was isolated according to Birnboim and Doly, Two of the twelve plasmid DNAs have the small 1.4 kb These plasmid DNAs are grown in mass culture and prepared for introduction by co transfection into eukaryotic cells. Alternatively, the The recombinant plasmids, pDM1 and pDM2, were co transfected into mouse L cells, vero African green monkey cells, CHO cells, and 3T3 mouse fibroblasts by standard transfection procedures Graham and van der Eb, Approximately 10⁹ total cells grown in DMEM 10 FBS in six roller bottles see Materials and Procedures were used to innoculate six hollow fiber cartridges in the Acusyst P culture system see Materials and Procedures . Approximately 600 ml fluid volume was harvested two times weekly from the extracapillary space of each Acusyst P hollow fiber cartridge and stored at 4 C prior to purification. The concentration of the particles of this invention was assayed by RIA see Materials and Procedures . Particles containing proteins coded for by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region produced by the novel cell lines were purified by polyethylene glycl PEG precipitation, gel filtration and isopycnic ultracentrifugation in CsCl gradients see below . Medium from the extracapillary space was harvested from the ACUSYST P culture system and pooled into volumes of 3000 ml. To each volume, 180 g of PEG 8000 SIGMA were added, dissolved by stirring at room temperature for 20 minutes and stirred for another 3 hours at 4 C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation in 500 ml bottles in a GS 3 rotor at 4500 rpm 3000 g for 30 minutes at 10 C. The supernatant was collected and 180 g of PEG 8000 are again added and dissolved at room temperature as described above. The solution was stirred at 4 C for an additional 3 hours. The precipitate from this solution was collected as desribed above except that centrifugation was performed at 9000 rpm 15,000 g for 60 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate buffered saline PBS . The material obtained after PEG precipitation, and redissolved in PBS, was submitted to gel filtration chromatography using BioRad A 5m resin at 4 C. Column dimensions were 25 1000 mm, and the bed volume was 480 ml. In a typical fractionation run, 1000 µg of PEG precipitated particles of this invention in a volume of 10 to 15 ml is loaded and eluted with PBS or TNE at a speed of 6 drops minute 18 ml hr in fractions of 3 ml. Figure 6 shows the profile of the particles of this invention eluted from an A 5m column. The solid line indicates the 280 nm absorbance of each fraction, and the dots indicate the quantity of the particles of this invention in each fracton as calculated by RIA. About 30 fractions covering the first peak resulting from gel filtration column chromatography see Figure 6 and containing partially purified particles of this invention were pooled approximately 100 ml . This solution was adjusted to a density of 1.30 g cc with CsCl and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose tubes fitting into a SW 27 or SW 28 rotor Beckman . Gradients were set by underlaying 4 ml of a CsCl solution of 1.35 g cc and by overlaying 4 ml of 1.25 g cc and 4 ml of 1.20 g cc density. Gradients were run at 28,000 rpm for 50 hours at 10 C, fractionated, and the purified antigen in the 1.20 g cc density layer at the top of the gradient was collected. The particles of this invention were well separated from the small amount of contaminating protein banding in the middle of the gradient see Figure 7 . The solution was desalted by dialysis against three changes of saline over a 24 hour period. As a quality control measure, a portion of this gradient purified material was submitted to linear CsCl gradient centrifugation. A single peak of the particles of this invention appeared as expected at 1.2 g cc. The purity and physical identity of the polypep tides of the particles of this invention in prepara tions are established by conventional laboratory techniques, such as radioimmune assay, immunoprecipi tation and SDS PAGE see Materials and Procedures . The levels of various serum proteins in prepara tions of purified prticles of this invention are assessed by the standard RIA technique using specific antibodies against bovine serum albumin, IgA, IgG, IgM, etc. The results shown in Table 2 show no detectable immunoglobulin contamination and only minor albumin contamination. A dot blot hybridization is performed on purified particles of this invention in order to check for contaminating PreS₁ PreS₂ S DNA sequences or host chromosomal DNA sequences. For each spot, a 100 ng quantity of purified particles of this invention in 40 µl 0.25 N NaOH is heated at 68 C for 10 minutes. As a positive control, 20 pg of recombinant plasmid pDM1 DNA of this invention in 40 µl 0.25 N NaOH is treated the same way. Immediately after denaturation in NaOH, the solution is spotted onto a nitrocellulose filter. The following treatment of the filter and the hybridizing procedures are analogous to those described for the Southern Blot procedure, except that the ³²P labeled probe is a 50 50 mixture of chromosomal DNA and plasmid DNA of this invention containing the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region. As expected, the hybridizing probe gives a strong signal with the recombinant plasmid DNA of this invention, but only a weak background signal with the purified particle preparation. This hybridization pattern indicates no PreS₁ PreS₂ S DNA or chromosomal DNA in the sample. To determine the pattern of PreS₁ PreS₂ S polypeptides produced by transfectants of this invention, proteins produced by such transfectants are biosynthetically labeled, immunoprecipitated and analyzed on SDS PAGE gels see Materials and Procedures . The electrophoretic pattern of proteins, isolated from culture medium by immuno precipitation with antibodies to naturally derived HBV, was visualized by the silver staining procedure. The two major proteins correspond in size to nonglycosylated and glycosylated polypeptides encoded by the S protein coding region 24 kd and 27 kd, respectively . Two minor proteins of 33 kd and 36 kd correspond in size to the two polypeptides encoded by the PreS₂ S protein coding region. This method is not sensitive enough to detect the small quantities of polypeptides containing the PreS₁ PreS₂ S polypeptides, but the presence of the proteins encoded by the entire PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region was detected by the western immunoblot procedure see, To establish that each of the polypeptides species appearing in the silver stained SDS PAGE gel system reacts with specific anti HBV antibody, the Western immunoblot procedure was employed. Proteins separated in a SDS PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter Schleicher Schull by electroblotting BioRad at 4 C, 100 V, 3 hours. After transfer, the filter is saturated with proteins in order to avoid nonspecific binding of peroxidase labeled antibody. To do this, the filter is incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in 20 newborn calf serum in PBS, and the polypeptides of the particle of this invention were made visible by HBV specific antibodies conjugated with peroxidase. The filter is placed on parafilm and covered with a solution of the conjugated antibodies for 3 hours at room temperature in a wet chamber. The filter is washed six times with 0.5 Tween in 10mM Tris and 5mM CaCl and subsequently covered with the chromogen, POD o phenylenediaminedihydrochloride in hydrogen peroxide 0.3g l in citrate phosphate buffer. Stopping solution is 0.5 N sulfuric acid. The protein bands corresponding to all six viral polypeptides appear, i.e., all the proteins coded for by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region. Following acid hydrolysis, the amino acid composition of the purified proteins coded for by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region is determined and compared with the polypeptide composition calculated from the nucleotide sequence of the S protein coding region, the PreS₂ S protein coding region or the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region. The results presented in Table 3 correlate well with values predicted from the DNA sequences as well as with published results Shiraishi et al, In the electron microscope, the purified particles of this invention were visualized as spherical 22 nm particles which are similar to those typically formed by the assembly of hepatitis B S protein polypeptides. In order to prepare an adjuvant of the vaccine of this invention, 1 10,000 volume Thimerosol, and 1 10 volume of filter sterilized 0.2 M Al K SO₄ ₂ 12 H₂O are added to the desired concentration of antigen in sterile saline. The pH is adjusted to 5.0 with sterile 1N NaOH and the suspension is stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The alum precipitated antigen is recovered by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm, resuspended in sterile normal saline containing 1 10,000 Thimerosol, and aliquoted under sterile conditions. To determine the stability of the particles of this invention absorbed to alum, the antigen was recovered by resolubilizing the alum in 3 sodium citrate followed by successive dialyses against 3 sodium citrate and PBS. The quantity of particles of this invention was then determined by parallel line radioimmune assay against dilutions of a purified standard in PBS 50 newborn calf serum. Stability testing results Table 4 show the purified particles either bulk or alum absorbed to be stable at 2 8 C for at least 7 months. The seroconversion tests are carried out on five groups of ten adult white mice Figures 8A, 8B and 8C . Gm female 1CR strain swiss mice are injected subcutaneously with 1 ml of alum adjuvant vaccine containing particles of this invention at the following dilutions 1 1 5.0 µg , 1 4 1.3 µg , 1 16 0.31 µg , 1 64 0.16 µg , and 1 256 0.078 µg . Mice are bled after 28 days, and anti body titer is quantitated by the AUSAB test in comparison with the HBIG standard. The serum samples from each animal were diluted four fold serially and tested in triplicate. The percentage of mice exhibiting a positive serotype declined with increasing dilution of particles of this invention. The dose resulting in 50 of the animals exhibiting a seropositive response ED₅₀ is about 0.05 0.25 µg of vaccine containing particles of this invention. In general, the seroconversion results obtained with the vaccine of this invention are indistinguisable from those obtained with the naturally derived vaccine. Gene sequences from recombinant plasmids, pBglII2.8, pBR322.βG2 a plasmid made by subcloning into the Referring to Figures 9A and 9B, the pBglII2.8 plasmid contains a gene segment 1.34 kb A polylinker plasmid, POLINK 23456, having a number of restriction sites contained within the polylinker region below was employed. POLINK 23456 is digested with The pBR322.βG2 plasmid is digested with The pMMT Referring to Figure 10, pDM2, which includes the MMT promoter, the PreS₂ S protein coding region and the protein X coding region, is digested with restriction enzymes The pENDO 1 plasmid is also subjected to The two retained DNA fragments 1.9 kb and 4.88 kb are then ligated to produce a new recombinant plasmid 6.8 kb designated pENDO 2 which contains the MMT promoter, the PreS₂ S protein coding region and the mg PAS t sequence. Plasmid pENDO 2 contains no non HBV viral genomic portions see Figure 10 . A third new plasmid, referred to as pENDO 0 see Figure 11 , containing a neomycine selection marker, is formed by digesting pMMT The recombinant plasmid vectors pENDO 0, pENDO 1 and pENDO 2 are co transfected into mammalian cells, such as mouse L cells, Vero African green monkey cells, CHO cells and 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, using standard co transfection procedures. G418 resistant transfectants are isolated and screened for production of the particles of this invention using the RIA method. Each of the plasmids, pENDO 1, pENDO 2 and pENDO 0, contain a unique restriction site, Similarly, the pENDO 0 fragment is polymerized with the pENDO 2 fragment by ligase, such as T4 DNA ligase, at a ratio of 10 1 pENDO 2 pENDO 0, for example, to form a pENDO 2 pENDO 0 mixed concatamer. The concatamer is then transfected into a eukaryotic cell, such as a mammalian cell. The cells will then be subjected to G418 selection and on the average each G418 resistant transfected cell will contain about ten copies of pENDO 1 to pENDO 0, in this example. Similarly, pENDO 1, pENDO 2 and pENDO 0 are polymerized by ligase, such as T4 DNA ligase, to form a mixed concatamer at a ratio of 10 10 1, pENDO 1 pENDO 2 pENDO 0, for example. The resulting mixed concatamer is transfected into a eukaryotic cell, such as mammalian cell, and the cell subjected to G418 selection. On the average, the resistant transfected cells should contain ten copies of pENDO 1 to ten copies pENDO 2 to one copy pENDO 0. Each of the resulting resistant cells should result in higher yields of the particles containing the proteins encoded by the PreS₁ PreS₂ S protein coding region. The invention also comprises recombinant DNA transfer vectors comprising the MMT promotor, any functional DNA sequence and additional DNA other than viral DNA. By the term functional DNA sequence is meant any discrete region of DNA derived directly or indirectly from any source which functions in a host eukaryotic cell transfected with the vector of this invention as a complete gene expression unit, a structural gene, a promoter or regulatory region. By complete gene expression unit is means a structural gene and the promoter and regulatory regions required for its transcription and translation. By promoter is means any region upstream of a structural gene which permits binding of RNA polymeraze and transcription to occur. By regulatory region is meant any region which regulates the rate of transcription of the structural gene. By structural gene is meant a coding sequence which serves to be the template for the synthesis of messenger RNA. Preferred structural genes include those coding for polypeptides of pharmaceutical importance such as a viral antigen, insulin, interferon, and lynphokines, rat or human growth hormones, tissue Plasminogen Aetivator, alpha 1 antiprypsin and the like. Most preferred is rat or human growth hormone. This invention relates to a recombinant DNA vector comprising the function DNA sequence and a MMT promoter. The MMT promoter may be incorporated into the DNA vector either in addition to the natural promoter for the DNA sequence or in place of the natural promoter. Preferably, the MMT promoter is located in the DNA vector immediately upstream of the DNA sequence protein coding region. Preferably, such vector also comprises a transcription termination sequence and a selection marker. Preferably, such selection marker is a drug resistance marker, such as the neomycine gene. Preferably, such transcription termination sequence is an SV40 termination site sv PAS t or more preferably the DEF region mg PAS t of the mouse globin gene. Such vector may be prepared by conventional recombinant DNA and other molecular biological techniques. In the most preferable case, using the mg PAS t region, the vector does not contain any viral DNA segments and is not oncogenic, i.e., it will not transform make cancerous any host cell into which it is introduced. Such vector, upon transfection into a host, if it does not contain an autonomous replication sequence replicon capable of functioning in a host transfected therewith, integrates into the host chromosome and replicates passively with the host genome. Preferably, the recombinant DNA vector of this invention should comprise the following characteristics Most preferably, the vector of this invention does not comprise an autonomous replicating sequence replicon capable of functioning in a eukaryotic host cell transfected therewith. A primary reason for using a non replicating vector system in eukaryotic host cells is that all vector systems capable of autonomous and extrachromosomal replication in a mammalian host eukaryotic cell transfected therewith comprise replicons which are derived from oncogenic viruses. It is desirable to employ vectors comprising DNA not derived from oncogenic viruses for expressing DNA sequences encoding polypeptides of pharmaceutical importance. This invention also relates to a transfected host eukaryotic cell transformed with a recombinant DNA vector of containing the functional DNA sequence this invention. Preferably, such host is a mammalian cell, most preferably a Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line, a vero cell line, an L cell line, or a mouse or rat fibroblastic cell line. Such host may be prepared by transfecting a eukaryotic cell with a recombinant DNA vector of this invention by conventional techniques. This invention also relates to a method for preparing the proteins coded for by the DNA sequence of interest which comprises a cultivating the transfected host of this invention under culture medium conditions which enable such host to express such proteins, and b isolating such proteins. Preferably, such transfected host is able to secrete such proteins into the medium. Preferably, heavy metal ions or steroid hormones, such as dexamethasone, are added to such culture medium to induce the MMT promoter and thereby enhance expression of such coding region. Heavy metal ions such as cadmium or zinc are most preferred. The optimal concentration of heavy metal ions or steroid hormone contained in the medium can be determined by conventional techniques. This invention also relates to the proteins prepared by such method. If the transfected host cell of this invention secretes such proteins directly into the culture medium, such proteins can then be isolated from the culture medium of the transfected host of this invention by conventional protein isolation techniques. If the transfected host cell of this invention does not secrete such proteins , they are obtained from a culture lysate of such host by conventional culture lysate techniques.
