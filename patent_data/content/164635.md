## Description
IMIDAZOTHIAZOLEMETHYLENE ACETOHYDRAZIDE DERIVATIVES,PREPARATION THEREOF AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONSHAVING DIURETIC ACTIVITY The present invention relates to imidazothiazolemethylene acetohydrazides having general formula I EMI1.1 wherein X, Y, n, R11 R2, R3 may have the following meanings, in all the possible combinations X and Y, which may be the same or different, repre sent H, CH3, C1 C6 alkyl groups, optionally substituted, aryl groups n is O, 1, 2 R1 represents C1, F, Br, C1 C6 alkyl groups, aryl and alkyl aryl groups optionally substituted R2 and R3, which maybe the same or different repre sent H, CH3, alkyl groups, cycloalkyl groups, aryl alkyl groups containing hete roatoms, heterocyclic groups optionally benzo fused. The present invention relates also to the single separate isomers of said compounds, and to their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Compounds I have activity on the cardiovascu lar system, showing a particularly remarkable diuretic activity, better than that of some well known diuretic drugs, antihypertensive activity and a very low toxicity. Moreover, the diuretic effect being mainly achieved through the elimination of water and such electrolytes as sodium and chlorine and much less through the elimination of potassium, makes said compounds suitable for use in therapy, avoiding the risk of hypokaliemia. The combination of the diuretic and antihypertensive effects, never attained in a single compound, is particularly useful and therapeutically advantageous in the treatment of essential hypertension, which requires prolonged administration of well tolerated or anyway low toxic drugs. The known structurally closest compounds to those of the present invention are imidazole derivatives having a variously substituted nitrile or hydroxymethyl or carboxy group at the 5 position. Said compounds have already been disclosed as having other types of activities Andreani et al., Eur. J Med. Chem. Clin. Ther. 17, 271 1982 . The present invention further relates to the process for preparing compounds of formula I , starting from intermediates II , whose preparation has been described by Andreani et al. in Farmaco ed. Sci.37, 573, 1980. The intermediates of formula 11 wherein one of the X or Y groups is methyl and the other one is hydrogen, are novel and therefore fall within the scope of the present invention. Said compounds II are preferably reacted with amino acetohydrazides III to give imidazo 2,l b thiazolemethylene acetohydrazide compounds I , which may be optionally oxydized to sulfonium salts or sulfoxides. Amino acetohydrazides III are preferably obtained by hydrazinolysis of the corresponding alpha aminoacids methyl esters IV see Scheme below . SCHEME EMI4.1 Alternatively, compounds of general formula I may b obtained by reacting a N,N disubstituted alpha aminoacid acyl halide V with 5 hydrazomethy lene imidazo 2,l b7 thiazoles of formula VI , formed by condensing hydrazine and 5 formyl imidazo thiazoles II . The sulfoxides or sulfones of the compounds of the invention may obtained by oxydation with peracetic acid or hydrogen peroxyde or lead tetraacetate, from the corresponding compounds I in which n 0. An alternative route to the above mentioned one to obtain sulfoxides and sulfones consists in the oxydation of imidazo 2,l bJ thiazoles of general formula VII , with suitable oxydizing agents, thus preparing compounds VIII , which give, through aVilsmeier s reaction, the corresponding 5 formyl derivatives of general formula IX , from which compounds of formula I wherein n 1,2 may be prepared through one of the above described processes.EXAMPLE 1 N,N Dimethylamino acetyl ffiB6 chloro imidazog2,1 b2 thiazole 5 yl methylene hydrazide 1.86 grams of 5 formyl 6 chloro imidazo 2,1 b thiazole 0.01 mole J.
