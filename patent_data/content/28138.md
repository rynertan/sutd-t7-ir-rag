# Sewing machine.

## Abstract
A digital speed control system for a sewing machine comprises a digital speed setting device 5 which responds to manual depression of a foot pedal by generating a digital position signal. A variable frequency divider 4 divides the frequency of speed related pulses so that its output fre quency is an integral submultiple of the input frequency, which is variable as a function of the digital position signal. A period detector 6 senses the interval between pulses that occur successively at the output of the frequency divider and generates a binary data representing the sensed inter val. The interval representing data is translated into a sec ond period data in an arithmetic unit 8 according to a predetermined transfer function. A pulse generator 9 translate the second period data into a pulse for activating a magnetic clutch 11a or a magnetic brake 11b depend ing on a sign of the second period data to accelerate or decelerate the sewing machine 1 .
