# Lead frame with fusible links.

## Abstract
Copper lead frame 10 for manufacturing a semiconduc tor chip carrier 11 has signal leads 19 extending from outer leads 17 about the periphery of the frame 10 and temporarily attached to a ground bus 30 toward the center of the frame 10 by fusible links 22 . Ground leads 24 extend from bus 30 alternately with signal leads 19 and have fusible links 21 at outer leads 17 which are melted to isolate them from signal leads 19 and eliminate noise between signal leads 19 in finished carrier 11 . A power bus 36 located within the ground bus 30 and a chip mounting pad 42 located within the power bus 36 are similarly positioned by fusible links 34, 44 .
