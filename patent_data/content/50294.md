## Description
Electrode construction and method of making the same Several proposals have been made on multiple electron beam type flat shaped picture display device, for example in the United States Patent Specification No. 3,935,500 and SID 78 Digest pp. 122 to 127. Furthermore, in order to obtain higher grade picture having larger number of picture elements three of the inventors of the present invention have invented and proposed a simultaneous scanning multiple electron beam type picture display apparatus described in the specification of the Japanese PatentApplication Sho 53 106788 filed on August 30, 1978 not yet examined and also.described in the specification of the United States Patent No. 4,227,117 patented on October 7, 1980. This apparatus can have very large number of the picture element in comparison with number of electron extracting apertures of its control electrode. The structure of picture image display apparatus of the above mentioned described invention is shown inFIG. 1 which is an exploded view of the principal part of the above mentioned apparatus. The apparatus comprises, as shown from the upper part to the lower part in FIG. 1, an isolation electrode 200 having a plural number of isolation walls 201 to define oblong isolated spaces 202, a row of predetermined number M e.g. M 15 of parallel disposed linear thermionic cathodes 1 i.e., line cathodes, each of which comprises a linear filament line to be heated by a low voltage, e.g., D.C. 10 V and electron emissive oxide coating thereon, and hereinafter is referred to as linear thermionic cathode each being disposed in the isolated spaces 202, an extractor electrode 300 having a predetermined number N e.g.N 107 of electron beam passing apertures 300a disposed in rows below the linear thermionic cathodes 100, a row of control electrodes 400 for controlling beam intensity disposed parallelly in a direction perpendicular to those of said linear therm ionic cathodes 100 each having electron beam passing openings 400a below the apertures 300a, an electron beam forming electrode 500 having electron beam passing openings 500a below the openings 400a, a row of vertical deflection electrodes comprising pairs of common connected first electrodes 600 and common connected second electrodes 600 , a row of horizontal deflection electrodes comprising pairs of common connected first electrodes 700 and common connected second electrodes 700 , an electric field shielding electrode 800, an anode 900 of vapordeposited thin aluminum film, and a phosphor screen 1000 formed on a face panel 1100 of a vacuum enclosure and under said anode 900. Every electron beams e, e pass through deflection spaces 620, 620 ... and 720, 720 ... defined by the deflection electrodes pairs 600, 600 ... and 700, 700 ... disposed regularly in the same order with respect to every electron beams as shown in FIG. 1.. In the operation of such multiple electron beam type flat display apparatus described in the above mentioned specifications, scannings of beam spots on the phosphor screen are made in the known line at a time type scanning, wherein ordinary time sequential image signal is converted into a plural number of parallel signals. For example, by taking a case to display an image field raster having numbers of picture elements of 240 in vertical direction times 321 in horizontal direction , with regard to the horizontal scanning of the beam spots the raster is divided into a plural number N of vertically oblong sections, wherein the horizontal scannings are carried out parallelly in all of N sections. Then, each section has picture elements of n 321 in the horizontal direction.For N example, when the number N of the vertical sections is 107, the number n of picture element in each section is 3. For such example, 107 beam spots are produced from each linear thermionic cathode and 107 control electrodes are provided in order to control the 107 electron beam intensities. In the apparatus, the horizontal scanning is made by using saw tooth wave having a horizontal scanning period H applied to the horizontal deflection electrode and in a manner that all the N beam spots are deflected simultaneously to scan in the same direction taking one horizontal scanning period H. The horizontal scanning period z is equal to the horizontal scanning period of the ordinary time sequential television signal.In order for attaining such line at a time scanning, the ordinary time sequential image signal is preliminarily converted into the N parallel signals of the line at a time type, each signal thereof comprising time sequential elements for three picture data. The vertical scanning of the described apparatus is made by dividing the raster into a plural number M of h orizontally oblong sections, and at first in the first section, for example in the uppermost section, the plural number of beam spots, which simultaneously scan, also scan vertically downwards . When the vertical scanning in the first section is over and all the beam spots reach the bottoms of the first horizontally oblong sections, then the forming of electron beams from the electron from the first linear thermionic cathode ends and the forming of electron beams from the electrons from the second linear thermionic cathode starts, and the vertical scannings of the beam spots start in the second horizontally oblong section and scan downwards in the same way as in the first section.The vertical scanning is made thus downwards to the bottom or M th section by applying a saw tooth wave having a period M where V is the vertical scanning period of the ordinary television signal. For the above mentioned example of the raster having the number of vertical picture element of 240, when the numberM of the horizontally oblong sections is 15, each of the section has the horizontal scanning lines of a number of m 21450 l6. That is to say, the example apparatus uses 15 linear thermionic cathodes, and each cathode vertically scans to produce 16 horizontal scanning lines. In such picture display apparatus, as elucidated in reference to FIG. 1, a high precision structure is required in positional relations and gaps between parallel electrodes, in order to obtain accurate scanning and beam current controlling necessary for high grade picture. In general, the electrodes other than cathodes of such flat type picture display apparatus are made ofNi Cr Fe alloy, and these electrodes have considerable sizes and are assembled with predetermined narrow gaps by utilizing insulating gap spacer substrates of glass or ceramic, and bonding of the above mentioned members are made by using sealing glass i.e., low melting temperature glass frit . In such construction punching on the insulating gap spacer of glass or ceramic requires difficult and rather expensive working, and furthermore, such glass or ceramic substrate has different thermal expansion coefficient from the electrode material inducing strain or crack of such insulating gap spacer substrate, leading to unstable or unreliable operations of the display apparatus. Summary of the Invention The present invention purports to improve the above mentioned problem of the conventional flat type picture display apparatus. The present invention enables to bond electrodes with high accuracy and without problem of strain or crack of insulating gap spacers. The bonding is made by using two parts of crystallizable sealing glass, namely a first part applied on an electrode and fired to crystallize to form hardened spacer, and a second part applied on the electrode or on the first part, the second part bonding the electrodes.Thus the bonded electrode construction includes a plural of electrodes, insulating gap spacers of first part of crystallizable sealing glass spacing a predetermined gap between the electrodes and bond of second part of crystallizable sealing glass bonding the electrodes.Brief Explanation of the Drawings FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a general example of a multiple cathode type flat picture image display apparatus.

FIG. 7A is a front view of the finished state of the construction of FIG. 7.Description of Preferred Embodiments Further objects and advantages are elucidated more in detail referring to the attached drawings illustrating examples of the present invention. In FIG. 2, a first electrode 1 and a second electrode 6 having oblong through holes 2, 2 ... and 7, 7 respectively, are to be assembled with a plural of oblong third electrodes 4, 4 ... having corresponding oblong through holes 5, 5 ... inbetween. These first electrode 1, second electrode 7, and third electrode 4 are made ofNi Cr Fe alloy. These members are not necessarily limited to the electrodes per se, but may be any auxiliary or related member thereof, for example, supporting frame or current feeding conductor, or the like, and therefore, the word electrode should be taken as electrode member which includes the electrode as well as the above mentioned auxiliary or related members.On a face of the first and the second electrodes 1 and 6, at the parts other than the through holes 2, 2 ... and 7, 7 ... of the electrodes I and 6, respectively, pieces or strips 3, 3 ..., 8, 8 of a crystallizable sealing glass are formed by, for example, screen printing process. For the sealing glass, a glass frit having a low melting point, for example, 7575W name of good produced and sold by Iwaki Glass Co., Ltd. ofTokyo Japan is used. On both faces of the third electrodes 4, 4 ..., pieces or strips 38, 38 ... of crystallizable sealing glass are formed similarly to the above mentioned strips and at the parts to corresponds thereto.Strips on either of the first and the second electrode 1, 6 or the third electrodes4, 4 ... are then heated to such a high temperature that the crystallizable sealing glass of the glass frit 3, 8 or 38 heated thereby become crystallized hereinafter this high temperature is referred to as crystallizing temperature . After such heating, the sealing glass is irreversibly crystallized, and the crystalline structure is retained even when the temperature is brought down or further raised. Then the strips on the other electrode, which has not yet heated, is then heated to such a lower temperature that the crystallizable sealing glass therein becomes a glaze, but not yet crystallized, and therefore will be crystallized at subsequent heating to or over the crystallizing temperature hereinafter, this lower temperature is referred to as glazing temperature . Then, by assembling the first electrode 1, the second electrode 6 and the third electrode 4 inbetween, pressing and heating them, the pieces or strips of sealing glass which have become glaze melt and bond the electrodes or electrode members all together. In this bonding step, the previously crystallized pieces of strips, which are now hardened, serves as gap spacers to define necessary gaps between the electrodes. FIG. 3 shows a step of another example embodying the present invention, wherein a plural number of oblong electrodes 4, 4 ... are to be bonded in insulated relation on a first electrode 1. The electrodes 4, 4 ... and 1 are similar to those of the first example. In this example, however, each of the strips of the sealing glass comprises first parts 3 formed directly on the first electrode 1 and second parts 38 formed on the first parts 3. The first parts 3 are formed by, firstly applying crystallizable sealing glass powder for example, the 7575W of Iwaki GlassCo., Ltd. mixed with a known vehicle containing, for example, isoamyl acetate, by means of screen printing process, and secondly, after drying the mixture, firing the sealing glass powder at the crystallizing temperature of e.g. 450 to 5000C, thereby to crystallize and harden the sealing glass. Then, the second parts 38 are applied onto the hardened strips of the first parts 3, by means of, for example, the similar screen printing process to that of the first parts 3 followed by a glazing step. The same kind of crystallizable sealing glass as that of the first parts 3 is usable for the second parts 38, but different kind crystallizable sealing glass may be used. The glazing of the second parts 38 is made by heating it to the glazing temperature of e.g. 350 to 3800C, thereby obtaining reversibly hardened strips which is durable to inadvertent scratching. Thereafter, oblong electrodes 4, 4 ... to be bonded on the first electrode 1 are put on the latter, pressed and the above mentioned members are heated to the crystallizing temperature of the crystallizable sealing glass of the second parts 38. Then, the crystallizable sealing glass is melt and changes to the crystallized state, and the oblong electrodes 4, 4 ... are firmly bonded to the first electrode 1 with accurate gap defined by the thickness of the first parts 3. In the above mentioned process, the glazing of the second parts 38 is preferable for the durability thereof, and reliability of the manufactured apparatus, but this may be dispensed with if scratching or damaging of the second parts 38 is not liable to occur. FIG. 3A shows a modified example where the second parts 38 of crystallizable sealing glass are disposed at the side of the first parts 3. In this case, in order to ensure reliable bonding, the thickness of the second parts 38 should be thicker than the first part 3 and for other matters, descriptions for the example of FIG.3 is similarly applicable to this example. FIG. 4 shows another example, wherein different from the example of FIG. 3, the crystallizable sealing glass strips 3 and 38 are divided into short pieces, and other parts are substantially the same to the example ofFIG. 3. By means of such divided strips construction, even when difference of thermal expansion coefficient between the electrode and the strips of sealing glass shows a considerable value, there is no undesirable strain or bending of each electrode and of the assembled electrode construction. FIG. 4A is a front view of an example which is a modification of the example of FIG. 3 or FIG. 4. In the constructions of FIG. 3 or FIG. 4, the largest gap space obtainable by the gap spacer is about 500 ijm, and when a gap space larger than 500 pm, accurate and uniform gap space can not be formed. The construction of FIG.4A shows an improved construction which can afford a desirable large gap by means of cascade gap spacer construction, where a metal spacer 100 is bonded on the electrode 1 by means of the double layer construction of the crystallizable sealing glass comprising the first part 3 and the second part 38 formed by the same way as those of the examples of FIG. 3 or FIG. 4. The way of FIG. 2 can be also applicable. Then another two layers of the first part 3 and the second part 38 are formed on the metal spacer 100 in the same way, and by this latter double layered sealing glass, the electrode 4 is bonded to the spacer 100, and resultantly to the electrode 1. FIG. 4B is a front view of another example which is a modification of the example of FIG. 3 or FIG. 4. In this example, the positional order of the first part 3 and the second part 38 between the electrode 4 and the spacer 100 is opposite to the case of FIG. 4A. This construction is made by forming the first part 3 and the second part 38 on the lower face of the electrode 4, instead of the upper face of the spacer 100. FIG. 5 is an exploded perspective view of another example, and FIG. 6 is a sectional front view of the example of FIG. 5, seen from the direction of an arrow VI of FIG. 5, wherein a row of parallel wire electrodes 12al, 12a2, 12bl, 12b2, 12cl, 12c2, ... as electron beam control electrodes are bonded between a first electrode 1 and a second electrode 6 having oblong openings 2, 2 ... and 7, 7 ... respectively for passing ribbon shape electron beams. The bonding is made by means of crystallizable sealing glass strips 15, 15, 15, ..., which are formed on the lower face of the first electrode 1 and on the upper face of the second electrode 6, at such parts other than the openings 2, 2 ... and 7, 7 Each .Each of the strips 15 are formed as shown by FIG. 7, which is an enlarged sectional view thereof, seen from the direction of an arrow VII of FIG. 5. The strips 15, 15 ... are formed by Firstly applying a first part 3 of crystallizable sealing glass powder for example, the 7575W of Iwaki Glass Co., Ltd. mixed with a known vehicle containing, for example, isoamyl acetate, by means of screen printing process, thereafter, after drying the mixture firing the sealing glass powder at the crystallizing temperature of, e.g. 450 to 500 C, thereby to crystallize and harden the sealing glass to form a first part 3 to serve as a spacer and then secondly forming a second part 38 by applying on the first part 3 by means of, for example, the similar screen printing process to that of the first part 3, followed by a glazing of the second part 38 by heating it to the glazing temperature of, e.g. 350 to 3800C, thereby forming the strips 15, 15 ... having sectional construction shown by FIG. 7. Then, wires 12al, 12a2, 12bl ... as control electrodes are disposed at accurate positions on the electrode 6 by means of appropriate step, for example by using a suitable jig, and then the first electrode 1 and the second electrodes 6 are pressed to the wire electrodes 12al, 12a2 ... , and the whole parts including the strips 15, 15 ... are heated, so that the glazed second parts 38, 38 ... are melted and then crystallized and hardened thereby bonding the wire electrodes and accordingly the first and second electrodes therewith, forming an assembled electrode construction as shown by FIG. 6 seen from the direction of arrow VI of FIG. 5 and by FIG. 7A seen from the direction of arrow VII of FIG. 5 . In this bonding, the gaps between the wire electrodes 12al, 12a2 ...and the first or second electrode 1 or 6 is accurately defined by preliminarily hardened spacer strips 3, 3Of course, the first electrode 1, the second electrode 6 and the wire electrodes 12al ... inbetween are each other insulated by the strips 15 of crystallized sealing glass, consisting of the spacers 3, ... and the bonding layer 38 ... . In case each wire electrodes are to be impressed of different voltage or signal, the hair pin loop shaped end parts shown by the dotted line should be cut away.On the contrary, when neighboring two wire electrodes are to be impressed of the same voltage or signal as pair electrodes, the hair pin loop shaped end parts should be left as they are. In the bonding step by pressing and heating the electrodes 1, 6, 12al ... together, the wire electrodes 12awl, 12a2 ... should be held with a suitable tension so as to be bonded straight without sag. It is preferable to select the wire electrodes 12awl, 12a2, 12bl ... having thermal expansion coefficient larger than those of the grid shaped or frame shaped first and second electrodes I and 6. This is for the purpose that in the finished display apparatus the wire electrodes 12al ... exhibit a desirable tension when cooled down to a room temperature or in an operating temperature of the display apparatus, which is sufficiently lower than the bonding crystallizing temperature. In the above mentioned description, the control electrodes are taken for the examples, but the application of the present invention is not limited to the control electrodes, but is applicable to the deflection electrodes, convergence electrodes or other electrodes. Furthermore, the number of electrodes to form the electrode construction is not limited to two layers or three layers as shown by the attached drawings, but constructions having more layers of electrode can be realized by embodying the present invention. The apertures of the electrodes 2, 7 and 5 are only one example, and may be of any form. The electrode construction in accordance with the present invention is specially suitable in accurately assembling thin electrodes of a large size formed by photolithographic etching process.
