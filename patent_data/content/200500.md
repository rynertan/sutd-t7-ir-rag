## Description
CMOS MEMORY BIAS SYSTEMS The invention relates generally to IC CMOS, dynamic random access memories DRAMS , and more particularly, to a voltage biasing scheme for a CMOS DRAM. Recent advances in CMOS technology have allowed memory circuit designers to realize the power reduction inherent in CMOS design while achieving high density. However, as memory cell size decreases to allow for high density arrays, the susceptibility of alpha particle induced soft errors in the array increases. A CMOS DRAM utilizing P channel memory cells disposed in an N well formed in a P substrate significantly reduces this soft error susceptibility. Further, the P channel transfer gate of the memory cell contributes to a quiet background for charge storage in the memory cell storage. Designs for CMOS DRAMS have been proposed in papers by Chwang, et al., entitled A 7onus High DensityCMOS DRAM, IEEE International Solid States ConferenceProceedings, 2 23 83, p. 56 Kung, et al., entitled ASub lOOns 256 K DRAM in CMOS III Technology, 1984 IEEEInternational Solid States Circuits Conference Proceedings, pp. 278 279 and by Shimohigashi, et al., entitled An N Well CMOS Dynamic RAM, IEEE International SolidStates Circuits, Vol. SC 17, No. 2, April, 1982, pp.344 348. In each of these references, a particular bias scheme is proposed for the CMOS P channel memory.The bias voltages of importance include the word line voltage levels Vwn , the bit line precharge voltage levels VBL , the capacitor plate voltage levels VCp , amend the N well voltage level VNw . The selection of these voltage levels is critical to the performance of The memory array. Among The problems inherent in a high density memory are precharge current spike and problems due to a change in the magnitude of the power supply voltage. Prior to sensing The bit stored in a memory cell, the voltage state on both the bit line and the dummy bit line are equalized. This equalization requires a supply of charge to all The bit lines in the array and results in a large spike in The current either supplied or sunk by the bit line voltage reference. Each memory array is coupled to an external power supply. Several problems related to bias voltage states are created during an excursion in power supply voltage levels known as voltage bumps. Among The more serious problems are charge injection, sense level disturbance, and reduction of The differential sense voltage state at the sense amplifier In The biasing schemes set references either VNW and or Vcpr and V Ã r tiX the power supply voltage level, VCC. During a Vgm bump, the voltage level at The storage node of the me cell changes due to capacitive coupling through Ebs oxide layer separating the capacitor platen storage node and through the PN JUnCti t the storage node and The N well. However, the magnitude of voltage change at the storage node does not equal the full magnitude of the voltage bump. Charge injection occurs when the PN diode formed between the storage node and the N well is forward biased. For example, assume that The storage node is charged to an original VCC equal to 6V and that VNW is equal to Vcc. If VCC bumps down to 4V then the PN diode is forward biased and current flows from the storage node to the N well. Under certain conditions, this current will result in bipolar latchup. Sense disturbance results when unselected cells storing charge 1 leak charge into The bit lines thereby disturbing the pre sense voltage state on the bit line. For example, if the voltage level at the storage node is 6V then the source voltage of The access transistor is 6V. The gate of the access transistor is tied to the word line so that the gate voltage is equal to Vwn equal to 6V. If VCC bumps from 6 volts to 4 volts, then VGS for the access transistor is negative, the access transistor conducts, and charge leaks from the storage node to the bit line. This leaked charge changes the presensing voltage level on the bit line. The sense amp is a cross coupled latch that is triggered by the differential voltage developed on bit line and dummy bit line. The magnitude of this differential voltage is very small and any reduction in this magnitude would greatly impair the performance of the sense amp. A voltage bump usually results in a reduction in the magnitude of the differential sense amp voltage and accordingly reduces the accuracy of the sensing operation. Therefore, a CMOS memory bias scheme that reduces, or eliminates, the problems of precharge current spike, charge injection, sense disturbance, and reduction of the differential sense voltage level is greatly needed by the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The present invention comprises a CMOS biasing system for a CitOS memory circuit coupled to an external power supply voltage, Vc. The system precharges bit line and dummy bit line to VCC 2 prior to sensing. Preferably, an N well is biased at 1.5 VCC and the capacitor plates of the memory cells are biased at Vac 2 In a preferred embodiment, the CMOS memory includes K CMOS sense amps SA , each coupled to a bit line, and a dummy bit line, with each bit line and dummy bit line coupled to M storage cells. The memory cells are disposed in an N well formed in a P doped silicon substrate. Each storage cell includes a first P region which functions as the storage node, a capacitor plate disposed above the storage node that is separated from the storage cell by an oxide layer, and a second P region coupled to a bit line or dummy bit line. The first and second P regions are separated by a channel being the region of the N well disposed between the first and second P regions.An access control gate is disposed over the channel and separated from the channel by an oxide layer. The first and second P regions, channel, and control gate form aP channel access transistor and the first P region and the capacitor plate form a storage capacitor having capacitance CST The second P region function as a bit line junction. The capacitor plates of all the storage cells are coupled to an on chip bit line emulating Vc bias generator. The bit line dummy bit line pair for each SA are coupled by a coupling transistor having its eon trol gate coupled to a first external control signal. According to one aspect of the invention, the bit line and dummy bit line are each coupled to the bit line emulating VCC 2 bias generator by a biasing transistor network with the transistors in the network having their gates coupled to a second external control signal. The bit line and dummy bit lines are coupled by the coupling transistor to precharge the line. Prior to precharge, the voltage state on one line of the bit line dummy bit line pair is equal to VCC C and the volt age state on the other line is equal to 0 as a result of a previous sense cycle. Thus, by coupling the bit line and dummy bit line, the voltage state on each line is precharged to about Vac 2. Accordingly, very little current needs to be supplied by the bit line emulatingVCC 2 bias generator voltage to equalize the voltage on all the bit lines in the array. Thus, the large current spike resulting during standard precharge operations has been eliminated. According to another aspect of the invention, the bit line dummy bit line pair is precharged prior to initiation a sense cycle to allow the voltages on the lines to settle. According to a still further aspect of the invention, the on chip bit line emulating VCC 2 bias generator contains circuitry to emulate the characteristics bit line dummy bit line pair, the coupling transistor, biasing transistors and the transistors in theSA. This emulation causes the output of the bias generator to closely track the voltage on the bit line dummy bit line pair that results from coupling the pair during precharge. Thus, when the bias generator is coupled to the bit line dummy bit line pair little current is required to equalize the voltage level on the pair to the output of the bias generator. This is a significant advantage, because supplying current to the bit line dummy bit line pairs in the array requires power. By minimizing the current supplied, the inherent low power characteristics of CMOS technology are fully realized. The bit line emulating VCC 2 bias generator compensates for leakage currents through the bit line junctions, maintains the correct precharge level during a Vcc bump to prevent signal loss, and biases the memory cell capacitor plates. The inventors have discovered that tying VCP to VCC 2 stabilizes the magnitude of the differential sense voltage during a voltage bump. Additionally, for a Vac 2 the magnitude of the sense disturbance is reduced to an insignificant level. Charge injection problems are also greatly reduced in the present invention because VNW is equal to 1.5 Vcc. Accordingly, a CMOS memory bias scheme embodying the present invention can reduce, or eliminate, the problems of current spike, reduction of the magnitude of differential sense amplifier voltage, sense level disturbance, and charge injection. Additionally, since the bit line dummy bit line pair are precharged prior to the initiation of the sense cycle, access time is minimized. Further, the use of a bit line emulating bias generator minimizes power dissipation.

The present example is a CMOS memory cell bias scheme. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 1 the circuit is configured on the surface 10 of a P doped silicon substrate. An N well 12 is formed on the surface of the P type substrate 13. A sense amp comprises a P channel cross coupled latch 14 and an N channel cross coupled latch 16. The P channel cross coupled latch 14 includes first and second P channel transistors 18 and 20 having their sources tied to a P channel source drive line 21. The first P channel transistor 18 has its drain coupled to a first circuit node 22 with the gate of the second transistor 20 also coupled to the first circuit node 22. The drain of the second transistor 20 is coupled to a second circuit node 24 with the gate of the first transistor 18 coupled to the second node 24. The N channel cross coupled latch 16 includes third and fourth N channel transistors 26 and 28 having their sources tied to an N channel source drive line 29. The drain of the third transistor 26 is coupled to a third circuit node 30 with the gate of the fourth transistor 28 also coupled to the third circuit node 30. Similarly, the drain of the fourth transistor 28 is coupled to a fourth circuit node 32 with the gate of the third transistor 26 coupled to the fourth circuit node 32. A bit line, 34, couples the first and third circuit nodes 22 and 30 and a dummy bit line, 36, couplesThe second and fourth circuit nodes 24 and 32. The bit line is coupled to a first set of 128 storage cells 38. These storage cells are described in more detail below with reference to Figs. 3 and 4.Each storage cell includes a transistor switched transfer gate 40 coupling a storage node 42 to the bit line 34. The storage node 42 and a capacitor plate 44 form a storage capacitor 45 having capacitance CST. The gates of the transistors in the transfer gates 40 are tied to a set of word lines 46. The dummy bit line 36 is coupled to a second set of memory cells 38. The first and second sets of memory cells 38 are defined by alternating wordlines 46. It is to be understood that the terms bit line and dummy bit line are relative. The bit line is the line coupled to a memory cell during a read, write, or refresh operation. For example, if the cell 38 accessed by WL1 is read then line 34 is the bit line and line 36 is the dummy bit line. However, if the cell 38 accessed byWL2 is read, then line 36 is the bit line and line 34 is the dummy bit line. All the capacitor plates 44 are tied to a common CP line 47 which terminates at a fifth circuit node 48. A fifth P channel coupling transistor 50 couples a sixth circuit node 52 on the bit line 34 to a seventh circuit node 54 on the dummy bit line 36. The gate of the fifth transistor 50 is coupled to a BLE signal line 56. A sixth N channel biasing transistor 58 couples an eighth circuit node 60 on the bit line 34 to the fifth circuit node 48. A seventh N chanael bias ing transistor 62 couples a ninth circuit node 64, on the dummy bit line 36, to the fifth circuit node 48.The gates of the sixth and seventh transistors 58 and 62 are coupled to a FABLE enable line 66. A 1.5 VCC well bias generator 70 is coupled to the N well 12. A bit line emulating VCC 2 bias generator 72 is coupled to the fifth node 48 by a VOLE line 74. Typically, an actual array would include a large number of the circuits depicted in Fig. 1. TheVBLEQ line 74 would be tied to all the circuits to assure that precharge level was the same throughout the array. The functioning of the circuit depicted inFig. 1 will now be described with reference to Fig. 2, which is a timing diagram calling out the voltage states on the word line, Vwti the voltage levels on P channel and N channel source drive lines 29 and 21, and respectively, the voltage levels on the bit line and dummy bit line 34 and 36, VBL and VBL, and the voltage levels on The BLE and BflE lines 56 and 66. The voltage levels shown in the timing diagram illustrate a read 1 sense cycle. Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, the read 1 sense cycle is initiated by externally changing the magnitude of the RAS signal from a high state to a low state. In this example it is assumed that the storage element coupled to WL1, storing the data element 1 , is accessed. A data element 1 is stored by charging the storage node 42 to a voltage level equal to Vcc. The capacitance of the storage capacitor 45 is equal toCYST. Therefore, the charge on the storage node indicating a 1 , QST 1 , is equal to CsTVcc. When a 0 is stored, QST 0 is equal to zero. Prior to the read sense cycle, RAS is high,BLE is low, and BLE is high. Thus, prior to the read sense cycle the bit line and dummy bit line are coupled by the fifth transistor 50 and the series circuit comprising the sixth and seventh transistors 58 and 62.Additionally, the bit line and dummy bit lines are tied to the output of the VcC 2 bias generator 72 by the sixth and seventh transistors 58 and 62. Accordingly, prior to the read sense cycle the bit line and dummy bit lines are precharged to Vcc 2. By precharging the bit line dummy bit line pair prior to initiating the sense cycle the voltages on the lines are allowed to settle thereby reducing noise. The signals fS and are also initialized to Vcc 2. When the read sense cycle is initiated by clocking RAS low, FABLE is clocked high and BLE is clocked low. Accordingly, the coupling and biasing transistors 50, 58, and 62 are driven into the non conducting state and the bit line 34 is electrically isolated from the dummy bit line 36 and the bias genera tor 72. VwL on WL1 is pulled low to couple the storage node 44 to the bit line 34. The charge on the bit line is increased by the quantity QST 1 . Accordingly, the voltage on the bit line is slightly higher than The voltage on the dummy bit line as indicated at point A on the timing diagram. This voltage difference at point A is the differential sense amp voltage applied to the SA. The source drive signals, S and ssS are then applied to the P channel cross coupled latch 14 and theN channel cross coupled latch 16. The voltages at the first and third nodes 22 and 30 are equal to the value of VBL indicated at point A of the timing diagram.Similarly, the voltage levels at the second and fourth nodes 24 and 32 are equal to the value of VBL indicated at point A of the timing diagrams. The cross coupled P channel latch 14 is triggered by the voltage difference at point A of the timing diagram to pull the bit line 34 up to the full VCC value at point B. Similarly, the cross coupled N channel latch 16 is triggered by the differential sense amp voltage indicated at point A to pull the dummy bit line 36 down to zero volts at pointB of the timing diagram. Precharging the bit lines and dummy bit lines 34 and 36 to VCC 2 facilitates the simultaneous pull up and pull down of VBL and VBL illustrated in the timing diagram. At the completion of the read 1 sense cycleRAS is clocked high. Slightly thereafter, BLE is clocked low, thereby coupling the bit line, 34, and the dummy bit line, 36 via the coupling transistor 50. The capacitance of bit line 34, CBL, and of dummy bit line 36, are areapproximately equal. Note that prior to the coupling of the bit line 34 and the dummy bit line 36,VBL is VCC and VBL is zero. Accordingly, when the lines are coupled the voltage levels on the bit line 34 and the dummy bit line 36, Vc, will be equal to the intermediate level between zero and VCC, i.e., about VCC 2. Subsequent to the coupling of the bit line dummy bit pair, ssBLE is clocked high to couple the bit line dummy bit line pair to the VBLEQ output 74 via the coupling transistors 58 and 67. The 4 BLE and BflE signals are clocked with reference to RAS. The generation of the signals is accomplished by standard techniques well known in the art. Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of a storage cell 38 utilized in the present embodiment. Identical or corresponding parts in Figs. 1 and 3 are given the same reference numeral. The bit line 34 is coupled to a P bit line junction 34A which forms a first terminal of the transistors in the transfer gates 40. The second terminal of the access transistor is the P region 42 which forms the storage node. The capacitor plate 44 is a polysilicon layer disposed over part of the storage node 42 and separated from the storage node by a thin oxide layer 80. The capacitance of the thin oxide layer 80 is equal to COX. The interface between the storage region 42 and the N well 12 forms a PN junction which acts as a diode. The PN junction has a capacitance equal to Cj. Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram of the memory cell depicted in Fig. 3. The effects of a voltage bump on the magnitude of the charge, QST, stored in the storage region 42 and the voltage at the storage node, VEST, will now be described with reference to Fig. 4. InFig. 4 the PN diode formed between the storage region 42 and the N well 12 and the inherent capacitance, CJ, of the PN junction is represented by a diode and a capacitor 90 and 92. During a voltage bump, from, for example, VCC equals 6 volts to VCC equals 4 volts, the quantum of charge, QSTT stored in the storage region 42 will change due to capacitive coupling through the thin oxide layer 80 separating the capacitive plate from the storage region, and through the capacitance CJ of the PN region formed between the storage region 42 and the N well 12.Additionally, the PN diode 90 may be forward biased, thereby allowing charge to be injected into the N well 12 from the storage level region 42. This changing of the charge level stored in the storage region 42 due to a voltage bump tends to reduce the magnitude of the differential sense voltage between bit line 34 and dummy bit line 36 generated during a read operation. Any reduction in the magnitude of this differential sense voltage greatly reduces the efficiency of the sense amp and causes errors in the reading of the stored bits of the memory. The inventors have discovered that biasing the capacitor plates in the array at VCC 2 stabilizes the magnitude of the differential sense amp voltage against Vcc bumps A further problem associated with voltage bumps is the disturbance of the sense level on the bit line due to charge coupling between unselected stored 1,l s and the bit line 34.This sense disturbance will be illustrated by the following example, where thh voltage level values given merely serve to illustrate the principles involved and are not intended to be the values achieved in an actual circuit. Assume that VCC bumps from 6 volts to 4 volts and, since the word line 46 is tied to Vice, that the voltage at the gate of the transistors in the transfer gates 40 drops from 6 volts to 4 volts. The source voltage of the transistors in the transfer gates 40 is equal to VST The charge stored at the storage node was set by charging the storage capacitor 45 when VCC was equal to 6 volts and, accordingly, VST, is equal to 6 volts. If the capacitor plate is tied to ground and the N well is biased at 1.5 VCc, then the voltage level at the storage node will drop from 6 volts to about 5.4 volts during the VCC bump. The storage node is the source of the transistors in the transfer gates 40 and, accordingly, VGS which is equal to the gate voltage minus the source voltage, is equal to 1.4 volts.Since the threshold voltage of a P channel transistor is equal to about .7 volts, the access transistor will be turned on and current will flow from the storage region to the bit line, thereby changing VBL prior to the sense operation. However, if the capacitor plate is tied to the supply voltage, or some multiple thereof, the sense disturb problem is reduced or eliminated. In the present invention, both sense disturb and prevention of differential sense voltage reduction are achieved by setting VCP equal to VCC 2. Additionally, charge injection due to reverse biasing the PN diode between the storage region and theN well is prevented because VNW is equal to 1.5 VCCIf VCC bumps from 6V to 4V the value of VNW is 6V and the diode 92 remains reverse biased. Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram of the bit line emulating Vac 2 bias generator 72 of Fig. 1. Referring now to Fig. 5, a P channel transistor 100 couples a VCC input 102 to a circuit node 104. The circuit node 104 is coupled to a bit line emulating capacitor, CBLE 106.An N channel transistor 108 couples a ground terminal 110 to a circuit node 111. The circuit node 111 is coupled to a dummy bit line emulating capacitor, CBLE 112. The gate of transistor 100 is directly coupled to a OSC input 114, while the gate of transistor 108 is coupled to the OsC input 114 through an inverter 116.The capacitors CBLE and C are coupled by a P channel transistor 118 and a series circuit comprising N channel transistors 120 and 122. The gate of transistor 118 is directly coupled to a OSC input 124 and the gates of transistors 120 and 122 are coupled to the OSC input 124 via an inverter 126. The source of tran sistor 120 and drain of transistor 122 are coupled to a circuit node 128. Circuit node 128 is coupled to the input of a unity gain buffer circuit 130 having an output providing a VBLEQ signal on the VBLEQ line 74. The circuit elements of the bit line emulating bias voltage generator 72 depicted in Fig. 5A correspond to the circuit elements depicted in Fig. 1. In particular, CBLE and CBLE 106 and 112 correspond to the capacitance of bit lines 34, dummy bit lines 36, and transfer gates 40 in the array, transistors 102 and 110 correspond to the transistors in the cross coupled latches 14 and 16 transistor 118 corresponds to the fifth coupling transistor 50 and transistors 120 and 122 correspond to the sixth and seventh coupling transistors 58 and 62. Each of the circuit elements of the bit line emulating bias generator 72 are fabricated to emulate the characteristics of the corresponding elements in the circuit depicted in Fig. 1 Fig. SB depicts the structure of CBLE andCBLE.Thus, both CBLE and CBLE closely emulate the total capacitance of the memory cells 38 of Fig. 1. The operation of the circuit depicted in Fig.5 will now be described with reference to the timrng diagram of Fig. 6. In Fig. 6 the states of OSC and are aredepicted as a function of time. During time interval nI OSC is clocked high to turn off transistors 118, 120, and 122 and to electrically isolate CBLE and CBLE 106 and 112. During this time interval ssOSC is clocked low to turn on transistor 102 and charge capacitor CBLE 106 to VCC while transistor 108 is also turned on to charge capacitor CBLE 112 to zero volts. Accordingly, during time interval tilts CBLE 106 is charged to VCC and CBLE 112 is charged to zero. During time interval II 1l OSC is clocked high to turn off transistors 100 and 108, thereby isolating CBLE and CBLE 106 and 112 from the Vcc and ground terminals 102 and 110, respectively. The signal OSC is clocked low to turn on transistors 118, 120, and 122 to couple CBLE 106 to CBLE 112. In this embodiment, the magnitudes of CBLE and CBLE 106 and 112 are equal so that the above described coupling step allows charge to distribute equally between the two capacitors and so that the voltage on both capacitors is equal to about VCC 2. The capacitors 106 and 112 are coupled to output terminal 129 during time interval II. The magnitude of the output signal, VBLE at the output terminal 129 is thus determined by charge sharing betweenCBLE and CBLE 106 and 112. The output terminal 129 is coupled to the input of the unity gain buffer 130. The output of the unity gain buffer 130, VBLEQ, is thus equal to about VCC 2 The magnitude of the output voltage, VBLEQ, closely tracks the magnitude of the voltage level, VC t generated by coupling the bit line 34 and dummy bit line 36, due to the emulation of corresponding circuit elements. The importance of this tracking is illustrated by the following example. It is well known that the output of any voltage reference is affected by temperature, and undesired variations in circuit parameters. Accordingly, while V C and V are nominally equal to VCC 2 minor devia BLEQ tions will be induced by the above described factors. Referring back to Fig. 1, assume that VCC is 5 volts and that the voltage developed by coupling the bit line 34 and dummy bit line 36, Vc, developed at node 48 is 2.2 volts due to variations in processing parameters. Further, assume that VBLEQ is 2.5 volts.Thus, the bit line emulating bias generator must charge the bit line dummy line pairs in the array to 2.5 volts by supplying current. The generation of charging current dissipates power and is deleterious to the overall performance of the memory array. In contrast, in the present invention Vc and VBLEQ are nearly equal due to the emulation of circuit components. Very little current is required to charge the bit line dummy bit line pair and, thus, minimal power is dissipated. The bit line emulating bias voltage generator 72 supplies current to the bit line dummy bit line pair to compensate for leakage current through the bit line junctions during the long precharge cycle. Additionally, it maintains a reference voltage level during a VCC bump to prevent signal loss and biases the capacitor plates in the memory cells. Thus, the buffer 130 must have a current source sink capability to perform these functions. A low power CMOS reference voltage driver suitable for use in the present system is described in a copending, commonly assigned, patent application by Chuang, et al., entitled Low Power CMOS Reference Generator withLow Impedance Driver, Attorney Docket No. A298, which is hereby incorporated by reference. This buffer has the current source sink capability to maintain all CPs at VCC 2 and to maintain the bit line and dummy bit line pair precharge level at Vac 2 Thus, the biasing scheme of the present invention reduces, or eliminates, the problems of precharge current spike, the reduction of the differential sense voltage signal, the problems of sense disturbance and charge injection.Additionally, precharging the bit line dummy bit line pair prior to initiating the sense cycle keeps the access time at a minimum. The emulation technique utilized in the voltage reference minimizes power dissipation. The invention has been explained with reference to specific embodiments. Other embodiments will now be apparent to those of ordinary skill in this art.In particular, the arrangement of the bit lines, memory cells, and other circuit components is not critical to practicing the invention. Further, small deviations from the exemplary bias voltage levels set forth may not be significant in particular applications. Additionally, the bias scheme of the present invention is suitable for use in a CMOS memory having N channel memory cells disposed in a P well formed in anN type substrate. Accordingly, it is therefore not intended that the invention be limited except as indicated by the appended claims.
