# ELECTROGRAPHIC COORDINATE INPUT APPARATUS

## Abstract
An electrographic apparatus utilizing a resistive layer which operates in conjunction with a stylus or tracer. Either the resistive layer or the cursor may be excited from an a.c. source to develop coordinate defining electrical signals. A sequence of border switching arrays is provided which minimizes the number of switching components required for any given resistive layer or tablet architecture. Improved accuracy is achieved through an automatic gain control and gain election procedure as well as through the imposition of a positive offset signal and a control technique wherein the offset values of the circuit are cyclically evaluated and the coordinate data information is adjusted in accordance with that evaluation.
