# Optical fiber connector construction.

## Abstract
A connector 10 for use in effecting an optical signal transmissive connection between the ends of optical fibers 18 is provided. The connector comprises a tricuspid fiber receiving channel defined by three convex walls 12 con nected along three longitudinal edges. The three convex walls are sufficiently rigid and uniform so that upon application of forces at the edges and directed toward the center of the channel defined by the convex walls, each of the three convex walls inwardly flexes in a uniform manner. As a result, abut ting ends of optical fibers disposed within the channel defined by such convex walls will be tangentially engaged by each of the walls and the fibers will be aligned along a common longitudinal axis.
