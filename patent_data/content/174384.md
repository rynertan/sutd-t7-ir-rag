## Description
Double Seat ValveThe invention relates to a double seat valve of the type defined in the preamble of claim 1.Double seat valves of this type are known from the EuropeanPatent Application 81 850 063.9. Although these valves have proven in practice to be in general highly satisfactory, in certain processes in the brewery and dairy industry there are still desired improved possibilities for a simple and reliable cleaning of the valve also with respect to the valve seats and the sealing means.From German Patent 24 56 675 there is known a similar doubleseat valve in which the second closure member can be moved be separate drive means independently from the first closure member into a position in which between both closure members and or the respective valve seats there is formed a slit not exceeding in cross section that of a drain tube connecting the leakage space to the atmosphere. This known construction, however, does not permit an adequate cleaning of the valve seat and the corresponding sealing sealing surface of the first closure member.From DE OS 27 51 734 and 30 05 329 there are further known other similar double seat valves having two valve discs each movable between a closed position axially sealing against a conical valve seat, and an open position axially lifted off the respective valve seat. With these constructions the smaller valve disc can be moved by the drive means into abutment with the larger second valve disc and thereafter both valve discs are moved together into the open position. In addition there are provided separate drive means for individually slightly lifting off each individual valve disc in order to enable a flow of cleaning liquid from the adjacent conduit past the valve seat to the leakage space.These known valves, however, are sensitive to pressure differences and pressure hammers in the conduits causing undesired opening movements of the valve discs. In addition, they do not permit any cleaning of the valve seats as long as the adjacent conduits are filled with product.Finally, DE A 31 08 778 discloses a method for the simultaneous cleaning of both valve seats of a double seat valve being in contact with product on at least one side. To this purpose it is proposed to move a slide type closure member in contact with product by a predetermined distance towards the product containing part of the valve housing and simultaneously retract or lift off the other closure member in order to simultaneously expose both valve seats to cleaning liquid.Accordingly, it is now an object of the invention to provide a double seat valve of the type defined in the preamble of claim 1, which with minimum product losses during valve operation enables an easy cleaning of both the valve seats and thf sealing means of each closure member and can be made to reliably prevent leakage caused by pressure hammers. In order to solve this object, the double seat valve defined in the preamble of claim 1 is provided with the features of the characterizing part of claim 1.Advantageous further modifications of the double seat valve are defined in the subclaims.Preferred embodiments of the invention are now described with reference to the enclosed drawings. There are shown in figure 1 a schematic longitudinal section of a double seat valve in the closed position left part of the drawing and the open position right part of the drawing , figure 2 a schematic longitudinal section through the double seat valve shown in figure 1 in the intermediate position of the first closure member right part of the drawing and the intermedia te position of the second closure member left part of the drawing , figure 3a a schematic partial section through a modified double seat valve in the closed position, figure 3b a schematic partial section through the double seat valve shown in figure 3a in the intermedia te position of the first closure member, figure 3c a schematic partial section through the double seat valve shown in figures 3a and 3b in the intermediate position of the second closure member, figure 3d a schematic partial section through the double seat valve shown in figures 3a to 3c in the open position, figure 4a a schematic partial section through a modified double seat valve in the closed position, figure 4b a schematic partial section through the double seat valve shown in figure 4a in the intermedia te position of the first closure member, figure 4c a schematic partial section through the double seat valve shown in figures 4a and 4b in the intermediate position of the second closure member, figure 4d a schematic partial section through the double seat valve shown in figures 4a to 4c in the open position. The double seat valve shown in Fig. 1 and 2 comprises a valve housing 11 consisting of an upper housing member lia having a conduit opening 1, a lower housing member llb having a conduit opening 2, and a cover member llc. The conduit openings 1 and 2 are adapted for connection to conduits not shown which in operation are used for delivering fluid or a cleaning liquid, respectively. The upper housing member lla and the lower housing member llb being releasibly connected by a clamping member 52, communicate through a valve opening forming an axial valve seat 3a and a cylindrical valve seat 3b. In the valve housing 11 there are coaxially guided a first closure member forming a slide piston 8 and a second closure member 9 between an open position and e closed position.The first and second valve members together realize in their closed positions a double seal between the space within the upper housing member lla and the space within the lower housing member llb. To this purpose the slide piston 8 is provided with a radial sealing ring 4 adapted to be in the closed position in sealing contact with the cylindrical valve seat 3b. The second closure member 9 has an axial sealing ring 5 adapted to seelingly abut in the closed position with the axial valve seat 3a of the upper housing member lla. The second closure member 9 has 2 cylindrical piston wall 9a sealingly guided for axial displacement in an opening of the cover member llc.The slide piston 8 is rigidly connected to a coaxial rod 14 and a drive piston 17 having substantially the same outer diameter than the cylindrical valve seat 3b and being guided for axial displacement in a slide ring 13 in the lower housing member llb. The rod 14 is guided for axial displacement in a slide ring 12 disposed in a central opening of an auxiliary cylinder 34 rigidly mounted on an upper flange of the cover member llc. Thus, the slide piston 8, the drive piston 17 and the rod 14 form a rigid unit slidably guided near both ends thereof.Between the slide piston 8 and the second closure member 9 there is formed a lakeage space 7 in both the closed end the open positions thereof. Said leakage space 7 is permanently connected to the outside by a drain channel 6 extending coaxially through the drive cylinder 17 and an opening in the lower wall of the lower housing member lib. Thus, any possible leakage past the radial sealing ring 4 or the axial sealing ring 5, respectively is drained from the leakage space 7 through the drain channel 6 so that any intermixing of the products in the conduits connected to conduit openings 1 and 2 will be prevented.In the rod 14 there is provided an axial inlet channel 22 communicating via radial bores with the leakage space 7. By introducing a cleaning fluid through inlet channel 22 it is possible to clean the leakage space 7 and the drain channel 6 in both the open and the closed positions of the first and second closure members 8 and 9. The rod 14 is additionally guided in a slide ring 15 in the annular second closure member 9. In the internal space surrounded by the cylindrical piston wall 9a of the second closure member 9 there are arranged a first compression spring 18 and a second compression spring 19. The first compression spring 18 is supported at its end remote from the valve seats against an auxiliary drive cylinder 43 rigidly mounted within the auxiliary cylinder 34 for purposes to described later. The first compression spring 18 permanent urges the second closure member 9 into its closed position. The weaker second compression spring 19 permanently acts against the second closure member 9 in order to hold together the lower and upper closure members 8 and 9.The prime mover for opening the valve is a pneumatic motor comprising a gas chamber 32 formed between the drive piston 17 and the bottom wall of the lower housing member llb. In order to move the valve into its open position, compressed gas is introduced into the gas chamber 32 via the inlet opening 20.Since the gas pressure will be greater than the strength of the first compression spring 18, the slide piston 8 end the rod 14 both rigidly connected to the drive piston 17 begin to move upwardly against the force of the first compression spring 18. The second closure member 9 is provided at its end facing the slide piston 8 with a recess 10 having a substantially cylindrical seat wall lOa coaxial to the cylindrical valve seat 3b and dimensioned to receive during opening movement the end portion of the slide piston 8 before the second closure member 9 opens. When the opening movement continues, the slide piston comes into contact with an abutment disposed in the recess 10 of the second closure member. Thereafter the gas pressure in the gas chamber 32 moves both closure members 8 and 9 together into their opening position shown in the righthand half of figure 1.When the gas pressure in the gas chamber 32 ceases, the first compression spring 18 forces the two united closure members 8 and 9 downwardly until the axial sealing ring 5 of the second closure member 9 sealingly rests against the axial valve seat 3a so that the second closure member 9 comes to a rest in its closed position, whereas the slide piston 8 continues to be moved downward by the first compression spring 18 until there is reached the fully closed position shown in the left hand half of figure 1.In order to enable an adequate cleaning of those parts of the cylindrical piston wall 9a and the circumferential surface of the drive piston 17 which during opening movement are displaced into sliding contact with the respective housing member, there are provided in the upper housing member lia a washing space 24 between sealing rings 25, said washing space 24 having an inlet channel 26 and an outlet channel 27 for a cleaning fluid. Likewise, the lower housing member lib is provided with a washing space 28 disposed between sealing rings 29 and having an inlet channel 30 and an outlet channel 31 for cleaning fluid.In order to enable an adequate cleaning not only of the leakage space 7, but also of the sealing surfaces of the sealing rings 4 and 5 and the respective valve seats 3 and 3b, there its provided an annular groove lOb disposed at the entrance end of the cylindrical seat wall lOa of the recess 10. The adjacent edge of the cylindrical valve seat 3b is slightly beveled and forms in the closed position of the second closure member 9 a sidewall for said annular groove lOb which is dimensioned to permit in an intermediate position of the radial sealing ring 4 opposite said annular groove lOb a flow of cleaning liquid along the cylindrical valve seat 3b and between the opposed circumferencial surfaces of the sealing ring 4 and the annular groove lob.In order to move the slide piston 8 to its intermediate position there are provided auxiliary drive means idependent from the pneumatic motor adapted to move the drive piston 17. In the auxiliary cylinder 34 there is disposed an auxiliary piston 35 having a radial sealing ring 36 being in permanent sealing contact with the internal circumferential surface of the auxiliary cylinder 34. The auxiliary piston 35 separates an upper gas chamber 40 having an inlet opening 38 from a lower gas chamber 39 having an inlet opening 37. The annular auxiliary piston 35 is sealingly guided for limited axial movement on the rod 14 which has an external projection 41 cooperating with an internal shoulder 42 of the auxiliary piston 35 for limiting the axial movement thereof.In order to move the slide piston 8 with its radial sealing ring 4 into the intermediate position there is introduced a pressuriced gas via inlet opening 37 into the lower gas chamber 39 to cause the auxiliary piston 35 to move upwardly from the position shown in the left hand half of sigure 2 to the position shown in the right hand half of the same figure. Since the internal shoulder 42 of the auxiliary piston 35 abuts the external projection 41 of the rod 14 at a position few millimetres before the auxiliary piston 35 abuts the upper wall of the auxiliary cylinder 34, there is obtained a lifting movement of the slide piston 8 by some millimetres into the intermediate position of the radial sealing ring 4. When the gas pressure in the lower gas chamber 39 ceases, the first compression spring 18 moves the slide piston 8 back into its closed position.In order to also clean the axial valve seat 3a and the corresponding axial sealing ring 5 there is further provided a second annular auxiliary piston 44 guided for limited axial movement in the auxiliary drive cylinder 43. The annular auxiliary piston 44 separates a lower gas chamber 46 connected via an annular channel 49 with an inlet opening 48 from an upper gas chamber 45 having an inlet opening 47. The internal circumferential wall of the auxiliary drive cylinder 43 is provided with an abutment 50 for limiting the upward movement of the second auxiliary piston 44 which in addition cooperates at its inner margin with a projection 51 at the upper end of the cylindrical piston wall 9a of the second closure member 9. In the embodiment shown this projection is a circlip 51 engaged in an annular groove of the cylindrical piston wall 9a.When pressurized gas is introduced via the inlet opening 48 and the annular channel 49 into the lower gas chamber 46 this causes an upward displacement of the second auxiliary piston 44 by a small distance of about 3 mm until the second auxiliary piston 44 comes into contact with the abutment 50 of the auxiliary drive cylinder 43. This movement due to the engagement of the second auxiliary piston 44 with the circlip 51 fixed to the cylindrical piston wall 9a causes a lifting movement of the second closure member 9 by a small distance of about 3 mm into an intermediate position enabling a flow of cleaning liquid from the internal space of the upper housing member lia between the axial valve seat 3a and the opposed surface of the axial sealing ring 5 into the leakage space 7.If during the movement of the slide piston 8 into its intermediate position it is desired to double secure the second closure member in its closed position there can be introduced pressurized gas through inlet opening 47 into the gas chamber 45 which includes the whole internal space of the second closure member 9 so that the latter is urged into its closed position by the first compression spring 18 and the additional gas pressure in the gas chamber 45. During the movement of the second closure member 9 into its intermediate position shown in the left hand half of figure 2, there can be introduced pressurized gas through inlet opening 38 into the upper gas chamber 40 so that the auxiliary piston 35 permanently urges against the external projection 41 of the rod 14.The double seat valve shown in figures 3a to 3d is closely similar in construction and operation to the valve shown in figures 1 and 2, except that the second closure member 9 also has a radial sealing ring 5a which in the closed position is in sealing contact with a second cylindrical valve seat 3c having a diameter slightly larger than the first cylindrical valve seat 3b. In addition to the annular groove lOb provided at the entrance end of the cylindrical seat wall lOa of the recess 10, there is provided a second annular groove 3d in the second cylindrical valve seat 3c at a predetermined distance above the area which in the closed position is in contact with the radial sealing ring 5a. Figure 3a shows the modified double seat valve in its closed position, whereas the intermediate position of the slide piston 8 is shown in figure 3b, the intermediate position of the second closure member 9 is shown in figure 3c and the open position of the valve is shown in figure 3d. The movement of the closure members between their closed position and their open position, the movement of the slide piston between its closed position and the intermediate position, end the movement of the second closure member between its closed position and its intermediate position are effected in the same way explained in connection with figures 1 and 2 by moving the drive piston 17 or the auxiliary piston 35 or the second auxiliary piston 44 by means of pressurized gas.The double seat valve shown in figures 4a to 4d is also closely similar in construction and operation to the valve shown in and described in connection with figures 1 and 2, except that said slide piston 8 comprises at its end facing the second closure member 9 an axially protruding outer annular rim 8a having a substantially cylindrical inner wall 8b, whereas the second closure member 9 is provided with an annular recess 10 having a cylindrical inner wall lOc dimensioned to receive during opening movement the annular rim 8a of the slide piston 8. In addition on one of said inner walls 8b or lOc there is provided a radial sealing ring 16 for sealing during opening movement against the opposed inner wall lOc or 8b, respectively, shortly before the second valve member 9 is lifted off its axial valve seat 3a.In this case, the annular groove 3d is disposed in the cylindrical valve seat 3b in order to enable in the position of the radial sealing ring 4 opposite said annular groove 3d a flow of cleaning liquid along the cylindrical valve seat 3b and between the radial sealing ring 4 and the opposed surfaces of the annular groove 3d into the leakage space 7. The movement of the closure members between the closed and open positions or the closed and intermediate positions, respectively are effected in the same way as described in connection with figures 1 and 2. Figure 4a shows the modified double seat valve in its closed position, whereas figure 4b shows the valve in the intermediate position of the slide piston 8, 4c shows the intermediate position of the second closure member 9, and figure 4b the valve in the open position.The double seat valve according to the invention have been described above with reference to preferred embodiments. It is possible to further modify the double seat valve in accordance with the requirements of the practice without leaving the principle of the invention.
