# Systems for transmitting light.

## Abstract
In a system for the transmission of light from a process measuring device to an alarm actuating circuit, an optical fibre 14 is positioned adjacent each process monitoring location and transmits light therefrom to a remotely located matte screen 12 from which it is reflected to a pair of optical fibres 16, 18 . The optical fibre 16, 18 transmit the light to respective optical diodes 20, 22 which are selectively actuated in response to the colour of the light being transmitted and which, in turn, selectively actuate an alarm circuit connected thereto.
