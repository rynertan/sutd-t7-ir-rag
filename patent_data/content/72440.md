# Standard or control material for glycosylated or total hemoglobin determination.

## Abstract
A control material for use in the determination of glycosylated and total hemoglobin, and a method of prepar ing the same, are disclosed. The control is prepared by the steps of hemolyzing red blood cells, preferably in the presence of a detergent, followed by removal of stroma and lipids from the hemoglobin with an organic solvent such as toluene in the presence of a polyhydroxy compound such as sucrose. A hemoglobin rich fraction is separated from the resulting mixture and dialyzed against a solution of a polyhydroxy compound. The dialysate may be lyophilized to provide a stable, dry product suitable for reconstitution.
