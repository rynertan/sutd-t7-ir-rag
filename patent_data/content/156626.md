# Superconductor with improved persistence characteristics.

## Abstract
In a multifilamentary superconductor, plural filaments 201, 202, 203, 204 are separated from one another by a ductile nonsuperconducting copper matrix 205 . The niob ium titanium filaments are arrayed through the copper, with one filament 201 being substantially larger than the others, and preferably, centrally located in the wire. Preferably also, the other filaments are arrayed in an annular configuration about the periphery of the wire.
