# Improved electromechanical pressure transducer.

## Abstract
An improved ceramic capacitive pressure sensor adaptable for use in automobiles is disclosed. The pressure sensor comprises a thin flexible diaphragm disc 22 having a capacitor electrode 24 deposited on it. A thick cylindrical base substrate 10 has a top surface 11 with a second capacitor electrode 17 deposited thereon and the diaphragm is bonded to the top surface of the base substrate by an annular glass ring 15 such that the first and second electrodes 17, 24 are separated from each other and face each other directly across an air gap 31. The diaphragm, the top surface of the base substrate and the annular glass ring form an internal cavity 31 in which a reference vacuum is stored. In response to pressure changes outside of this cavity, the diaphragm will flex and thereby change the capacitance created by the first and second electrodes. At least one channel portion 20 is provided in the base substrate top surface which opens into the cavity storing the reference vacuum. This improves the electrical and mechanical characteristics of the pressure sensor. The diaphragm electrode 24 is substantially larger than the base electrode 17 and extends substantially over all of the central portion of the diaphragm within the glass annular ring and in this manner the electrode acts as a shield against conductive elements which are exterior to the internal cavity and are adjacent to the thin diaphragm.
