# Colour display tube.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a colour display tube comprising a shadow mask 12 placed in front of the display screen 8 . The shadow mask 12 , at least on the side remote from the display screen, is coated with a glass layer 14 containing a heavy metal. The object of such a layer 14 is to reflect electrons incident on it so as to reduce local or overall heating. When the heavy metal containing layer is a glass layer, this layer has a smaller tendency to form particles than does a non vitreous layer of a compound of a heavy metal . This is in favour of the picture quality, and the shadow mask is more regid.
