# Suspension device for automobiles.

## Abstract
A suspension device for automobiles performs chang ing over of the damping force of a shock absorber 5 and the spring constant of a suspension spring 9 by an output from an acceleration sensor 2 or an output from a road clearance sensor 3 mounted on the vehicle body 4 . The changing. over operation is not performed by magnitude of an output but is performed only when an output greater than a predetermined level continues for a predetermined time period to avoid unnecessary change over operations of the suspension characteristic during cruising on a rough road.
