The alignment procedure comprises reflecting a beam emitted by the transducer 2 from concentric reflecting surfaces, M₁, m₂ the common axis 9 of which is rotated 8 around the mechanical axis 5 whilst orthogonal x, y, z corrections to the transducer 1 position are made in order to establish the position of maximum constant reflectance. These steps determine the focal position 0 . The angular αβ position of the reflecting surfaces M₁, M₂ is then adjusted by rotation around the focal position 0 , again until a maximum constant reflection is obtained, and because these surfaces M₁, M₂ are coupled to a rotatable support 4 enclosing the housing of the transducer 1 the support 4 is repositioned accordingly. The support 4 is then secured to the housing 1 .

## Description
PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR THE ALIGNMENT OF A TRANSDUCER FORMING PART OF A RADIATION GENERATOR The invention relates to a process and apparatus for the alignment of a transducer forming part of a radiation generator, such as for example piezo electric crystals used for generating ultrasonic waves. The invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying out the alignment of transducers enclosed in a housing. In automatic control and measuring apparatuses such transducers are generally mounted in a housing which permits accurate positioning of the transducer with respect to the object to be examined. In certain cases however, when the positiening is very critical, the setting and alignment of a single transducer may take a rather long time. It is further often necessary to be able to change the transducer in order to carry out experiments to other frequencies or to exchange the transducer for another one having the same characteristics, especially concerning beam properties, without having to change the initially defined settings. In view of the fact that in practice transducers, although being theoretically equal, differ because of irrgularities of the surface and internal structure, is often not possible to exchange one transducer for another without affecting the accuracy of the measurement. The invention is meant to overcome these inconveniences and to provide an effective and fast method for aligning .nd exchanging transducers while maintaining a quantitative ad qualitative reproducible measurement which is especially important for transducers with optical and sonic properties eh as ultrasonic generators or other types of sound and wight beam generators. Accordingly the invention comprises a method for the alignment of a transducer forming part of a radiation generator enclosed in a housing by causing the mechanical s and the optical and acoustical axis to coincide, rein a beam emitted by the transducer is reflected at concentric surfaces spaced apart in parallel relationship with each other, the common axis of which is parallel to spaced laterally from the mechanical axis, and rotated .ownd the latter axis in a first step, the transducer closed in its housing being translated in the orthogonal f irections in a second step, which steps are carried out íyEsil the position of the transducer is adjusted in such a way that a constant maximum reflectance signal is cbtalned, whereafter the angular position of the reflecting surfaces, which are coupled to a rotatable support enclosing the housing of the transducer, is adjusted by rotation around the focal point determined by the first Lfl second step until a constant maximum reflectance signal is obtained, the final step consisting in fixing e support to the housing. The invention also comprises an apparatus for carrying out the above method comprising a transducer enclosed and fixable in a housing, to which housing is connected a rotatable support member, a mirror system including at least two concentric, spaced apart surfaces in parallel relationship, the common axis of which is rotatable around the mechanical axis, means to translate the transducer and housing in the orthogonal directions, means to rotate the mirror system about the mechanical axis, a rotatable support enclosing the housing of the transducer, means to rotate the mirror system around the focal point as determined, a coupling between the mirror system and the support, and means to fix the support to the housing in the aligned position. Preferably the transducer consists of a crystal which is fixed and fixable in a housing, for instance by means of an adhesive such as a resin. Preferably after the mechanical axis and the acoustical axis are made to coincide the angular position of the crystal is set by means of an auxiliary ring, which is rotatably coupled to the mirror system formed by the reflecting surfaces and which can be fixed to the housing. To determine the angular position after the aforementioned axes are made to coincide, the mirror system is rotated about the focal point determined after the combined aforementioned rotational and translational movements have been carried out, the auxiliary ring being coupled to the mirror system with a cord or with another means. The focal point is determined by the intersection of the mechanical axis with the plane of the first reflecting surface in the beam. Preferably the mirror system consists of a bar, the top end of which is a reflecting surface and the other end, which is enlarged, forms a second concentric annular reflecting surface. Tbe mirror system is preferably mounted on a Cardan system to carry out the desired translational movement in the orthogonal directions. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a cross section of an embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a cross section along the line II II of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a schematic representation of the essential steps of the alignment procedure and Figure 4 is a further schematic representation of the alignment procedure. In Figure 4, 1 denotes a housing wherein the transducer, n this case a crystal 2, is present. The crystal can be mixed in its position by an adhesive 3. The housing is enclosed in an auxiliary ring 4, which can be turned around the crystal. The axis of the housing is represented by nc dashed line 5, which defines the mechanical axis of v. .e radiation generator. The lines 6 and 7 indicate the wnich is emitted by the crystal when activated and e focal point of which is at 0 when the alignment has n performed. X and Y show the orthogonal directions µ 0. At a small distance of the mechanical axis a double mirror system is present, consisting of a bar 8 with two reflecting surfaces M1 and M2, which are parallel and concentric. The axis of the mirror system isirepresented by the dashed line 9. The arrow t indicates that the axis 9 can be rotated around the mechanical axis 5. Arrows a and p indicate rotations in respectively X and Y directions. The arrangement works as follows It is intended to align the mechanical axis with the acoustical axis of the ultrasonic beam F emitted by the transducer when activated. This alignment, which results in the sealing of the housing 1 in the auxiliary ring 4, which is used as reference, permits this ring during use of the transducer being utilized as a reference for the positioning as well as for the inclination of the beam.In use a first means, which is not shown, rotates the axis around the axis 5 in such a way that the mirror system is submitted to an eccentric rotation around the axis. As is apparent from the drawing the enlarged section of the bar extends across the axis 5. A suitable means is for instances Cardan system which enables an orientation in two planes.The two reflecting mirrors M1 and N2 are spaced apart at a distance which is determined by the focal characteristics of the transducer if for instance the characteristics of the focal zone are as follows 4 12mm 6, i.e. between 8mm and 18mm, the distance between the two reflectors is chosen at IOmm the distance of the transducer to the first reflector is then set at 8mm. In this way the first reflector is placed at the entrance and the second at the outlet of the focal zone of the transducer. These values, which are indicated as dl and d2 inFigure 3, are not critical because the sensitivity can easily be adjusted by controlling the amplification. As shown in Figure 4 the second reflection surface extends in the direction of the axis 5 which gives rise to the eccentric movement. At the same time the eccentric movement is carried out by the transducer and housing inside the auxiliary ring are subjected to a translational movement in the orthogonal directions X, Y and Z. Finally the mirror system is by meons of a third mechanism rotated round the intersection of axis 5 with the upper plane of mirror M1 by means of a cord which forms part of the auxiliary ring. The eccentricity indicated as d3 in Figure 3 will be chosen at a higher value if the transducer is focussed in one point. The degree of eccentricity is determined by the difference of the coordinates seen on the surface of the acoustical outlet surface of the transducer of the housing of the transducer and the acoustical beam. This my be expressed in polar or cartesian coordinates. The alignment process thus consists of three steps. In the first step the mirror M1, M2 is put into rotation as explained above. In the second step the echo of the front reflecting surface is adjusted until a maximum constant amplitude is obtained by displacing the housing in the ring as explained above. When the echo signal is constant and at a maximum, the focal point, if any, is centred by symmetrical considerations. This becomes as explained point 0 of the generator. By means of the third mechanism the angular position of the mirror system and consequently of the ring which is coupled to the mirror system is adjusted until a maximum constant amplitude of the rear mirrors echo is obtained. Subsequently the housing is sealed to the ring in the position as obtained at the end of the third step. The principle as described is also applicable to other types of reference systems and is independent of the type of the mechanism by which the relative movements of the transducer and mirrors are effected. The various steps which are carried out in the alignment procedure are for the sake of clarity separately illustrated in Figure 3, wherein the element and the mirror system are once more shown The mirrors M1 and M2 are rotated in the direction of the yarrow by means of mptor M. This arrow represents a rotation about the Z axis. Arrows a and ss represent angular corrections in the orthogonal X and Y directions, which may for instance be carried out through a Cardan system. The arrows x, y and z represent the translational movements to which the transducer may be subjected in order to carry out focal distance corrections as well as eccentricity corrections.
