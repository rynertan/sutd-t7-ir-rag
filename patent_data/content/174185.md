# Semiconductor device and manufacturing method thereof.

## Abstract
A concave portion 22 having a V shaped cross section is formed in a contact region C₁ of a p type silicon substrate 10 . The contact region C₁ is defined by a hole 20 formed in an insulative layer 18 formed over the substrate 10 . An n type diffusion layer 24 is formed in the substrate 10 so as to surround the concave portion 22 . The n type diffusion layer 24 is connected to a drain region 14 of a FET Q₁ . A metal layer 26 is formed on the insulative layer 18 such that the metal layer 26 is in electric contact with the diffusion layer 24 through the increased surface area of the concave portion 22 in the contact region C₁ .
