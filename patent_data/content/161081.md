# Hybrid gas turbine rotor.

## Abstract
A hybrid gas turbine rotor 10 having a silicon carbide ceramic turbine wheel portion 84 and a nickel alloy steel shaft portion 86 further includes a hollow silicon carbide ceramic stub shaft 90 integral with the turb ne wheel portion 84 having a frustoconical outer surface 96 tapering away from the wheel portion 84 and a tubular end 104 on the shaft portion 86 having an inner frustoconical surface 108 tapering towards the shaft portion 86 at an angle corre sponding to the outer surface taper angle. The shaft portion 86 is connected to the wheel portion 84 by shrink fitting the tubular end 104 over the stub shaft 90 so that the shrink fit is the sole medium whereby the wheel portion 84 is supported on the shaft portion 86 and torque is trans ferred therebetween.
