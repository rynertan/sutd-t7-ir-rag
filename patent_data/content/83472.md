# Automatic mass spectrometer inlet system.

## Abstract
There is provided a mass spectrometer having a gas inlet system for introducing a sample 1 into the ion source 15 of the spectrometer which inlet system includes a cold trap 11 for condensing a sample 1 . The inlet system is provided with means 6 for detecting the pressure therein and means for au tomatically controlling the operation of the cold trap 11 in de pendence on the detected pressure whereby the sample 1 is automatically condensed in the cold trap 11 when it is pres ent in a small quantity. Around the cold trap 11 is convenient ly a coolant passage through which coolant from a coolant res ervoir is drawn.
