# PROCESS FOR THE POLYMERISATION AND COPOLYMERISATION OF VINYL CHLORIDE IN SUSPENSION

## Abstract
An improved process for the polymerisation and copolymerisation of vinyl chloride in suspension, characterised by using, together with the normal polymerisation agents, a single suspending agent consisting of partially saponified polyvinyl acetate of medium degree of hydrolysis, prepared by the controlled alkaline alcoholysis of polyvinyl acetate in the presence of methyl acetate.
