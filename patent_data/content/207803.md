# Metal strip for use in stabilised earth structures.

## Abstract
A rolled metal strip 1 for use in stabilised earth structures has at periodic intervals along its length thickened reinforce ment regions 7 formed during the rolling operation. The strip is cut into required lengths such that each strip length has an end reinforced region 6 through which an aperture 5 is then formed to receive a bolt 3 passing through a bracket 4 of a facing 2. The strip may include transverse ribs 8 at intervals on both faces of the strip to assist engagement with the sur rounding soil.
