# SEALING CAP

## Abstract
A sealing cap for e.g. a bottle 40, comprises a tubular body 10 and a plug 30 disposed within the through bore 14 of this body. The plug 30 is displaceable within the through bore from an initial position in which it seals the through bore, to an intermediate position in which it is a loose fit so that the container may be evacuated through the body 10, and then to an final position in which it seals the through bore. The cap has particular utility for blood sampling bottles, which are evacuated and then pierced through the cap by a fine tubular needle so as to apply suction to the needle, from within the bottle, and thus draw a sample of blood through the needle and into the bottle.
