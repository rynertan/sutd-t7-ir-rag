## Description
The present invention relates to a vinylidene fluoride based polymer dielectric having a high dielectric constant and a low dielectric dissipation factor combination. Polymer dielectrics are widely used, for example, as materials for electric capacitors or condensers mainly of small sizes because they can be easily formed into films. Polymer dielectric materials well known heretofore include polyethylenes, polyethylene terephthalates hereinafter abbreviated as PET , polycarbonates, and polystyrenes. Among these, PET has both a relatively low dissipation factor hereinafter referred to as tan δ of 0.6 at 20 C and 1 kilo hertz KHz and an excellent film forming property, and is widely used as a useful polymer dielectric material. However, while PET has a low tan δ, it also has a small dielectric constant of 3.2 at 20 C and 1 KHz. Moreover, PET is relatively hygroscopic and therefore has a drawback that its dielectric properties vary according to change in enviromental conditions. On the other hand, polyvinylidene fluoride hereinafter abbreviated as PVDF has the highest level of dielectric constant among the synthetic polymers, has an excellent shapability or processability and also has a low hygroscopicity which is an advantageous feature as a dielectric material when compared with PET. However, this PVDF has a tan δ of 1.0 or above which is larger than 0.6 of PET and is not desirable as a material for an usage requiring small dielectric loss. A principal object of the invention is, in view of the above circumstances, to provide a vinylidene fluoride based polymer dielectric having a low tan δ comparable with that of PET and also having a good shapability or processability, while retaining a dielectric constant higher than that of PET. As a result of our researches, it has been discovered that the above object can be accomplished by a vinylidene fluoride ethylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer formulated in specific component proportions. The polymer dielectric of the present invention is provided based on the above knowledge and, more specifically, comprises a copolymer of 20 to 33 mol. of vinylidene fluoride, 15 to 45 mol. of ethylene and 30 to 65 mol. of tetrafluoroethylene, and has a dielectric constant of 4.0 or larger and a dielectric dissipation factor tan δ of 0.8 or less at 20 C and 1 KHz and which is obtainable by a process of suspension polymerization in water or of bulk polymerization, employing a peroxide polymerization initiator or an azo type polymerization initiator. In the meantime, a vinylidene fluoride ethylenetetrafluoroethylene terpolymer These and other objects and features of the present invention will be more readily apparent in view of the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings. In the drawings Figure 1 and Figure 2 are graphs respectively showing the values of dielectric constant and dielectric dissipation factor tan δ plotted versus the varying temperature measured at 30 Hz with respect to a terpolymer film obtained in Example 2 appearing hereinafter. The copolymer constituting the dielectric of the invention contains three components, vinylidene fluoride, ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene as indispensable components, and any two of them fail to give the desired properties. Thus, vinylidene fluoride and ethylene have poor copolymerizability with each other, and a copolymer with a high dielectric constant and low tan δ has not yet been obtained from the combination of these. While copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and tetrafluoroethylene have been widely known, they are caused to have extremely poor shapability and it is difficult to shape them into films adapted for condenser materials if the content of tetrafluoroethylene is large. In contrast thereto, if the vinylidene fluoride content is large, the resultant vinylidene fluoride tetrafluoroethylene copolymer will have properties similar to those of PVDF having a high dielectric constant but it is also very difficult to lower the tan δ of the copolylmer. Further, while a copolymer of ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene is also known as a heat resistant resin with good shapability and has a low tan δ, it has a small dielectric constant. In order to obtain the desired dielectric properties in combination, it is very important to satisfy the compositional proportions among the three components. Thus, only a copolymer having a limited composition of 20 to 33 mol. of vinylidene fluoride, 15 to 45 mol. of ethylene and 30 to 65 mol. of tetrafluoroethylene, is used in the invention. If the content of vinylidene fluoride in the product copolymer is less than 20 mol. , the copolymer is caused to have a dielectric constant below 4.0. In contrast thereto, if the vinylidene fluoride content exceeds 33 mol. ,.the copolymer, while having a large dielectric constant, is caused to have a tan δ of above 0.8 and fails to give the required dielectric properties in combination. When the ethylene content is less than 15 mol. , the contents of vinylidene fluoride and tetrafluoroethylene become relatively larger, whereby the resultant copolymer becomes poor in shapability so that it is difficult to shape it into films, and, moreover the tan δ thereof increases. In contrast, when the ethylene content is above 45 , the copolymerizability of the composition becomes poor, whereby the production of the copolymer becomes difficult. Next, when the tetrafluoroethylene content is below 30 mol. , the contents of ethylene and vinylidene fluoride having poor copolymerizability with each other become large, and it is difficult to produce a desired random copolymer. When above 65 mol. , the product copolymer will have good heat resistance but have extremely poor shapability, whereby it is difficult to form thin films therefrom. While the polymer dielectric of the invention comprises three components of vinylidene fluoride, ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene as indispensable components thereof as described above, it can also contain a minor amount, e.g. 5 mol. or less thereof, of a monomer copolymerizable with the above three components, with the proviso that the resultant copolymer satisfies the required dielectric properties, that is, a dielectric constant of 4.0 or above and a tan δ of 0.8 or below at 20 C and 1 KHz. Examples of such copolymerizable monomers include propylene, isobutylene, vinyl fluoride, trifluoroethylene, trifluoromonochloroethylene and hexafluoropropylene. The copolymer constituting the polymer dielectric of the invention is obtainable by a suspension polymerization process using water as the dispersion medium or a bulk polymerization process, both using as polymerization initiator a peroxide initiator or an azo type initiator. On the contrary, by a solution or suspension polymerization using an organic solvent as dispersion medium, it is difficult to produce a copolymer having a sufficiently large degree of polymerization, and the resultant copolymer not only is poor in physical properties but also fails to give desired dielectric properties, especially a low tan δ. The polymer dielectric of the present invention also has a good shapability and is readily shaped into a dielectric in the form of film or sheet through heat forming processes. As the heat forming processes for the production of films or sheets, known forming processes are generally available, including those using hot presses, extruders or calendering rolls. In order to obtain an especially thin film, it is possible to further subject the thus obtained film or sheet to roll pressing or mono or multi axial stretching. Particularly, by the stretching, some improvement in dielectric properties can be attained along with the formation of thin films. As has been described hereinabove, the present invention provides a vinylidene fluoride ethylenetetrafluoroethylene copolymer of a specific composition, which has a dielectric constant larger than that of PET and a dielectric dissipation factor tan δ substantially equal to that of PET and also is excellent in anti hygroscopicity, heat resistance and shapability. Accordingly, the dielectric is especially useful as a material for electric condenser films for which a high dielectric constant and a low dielectric loss are required in combination. When used as a condenser material, the polymer dielectric of the invention is preferably formed into films each of 1 200 microns micrometres , particularly stretched films each of 1 100 microns micrometers in thickness. Furthermore, these films may be used as a condenser film laminate composed of a plurality of films stacked in layers. In this case, each film layer should preferably have a thickness of 1 to 50 microns micrometres . The present invention will be explained more specifically hereinbelow by referring to actual examples of experiments and comparison examples. In the following description, the dielectric constants and tan δ represent values obtained by measurement at 20 C and 1 KHz unless otherwise noted. Into a 1 liter autoclave provided with a stirrer were charged 580 g of distilled water, 0.2 g of methyl cellulose suspension aid and 4.0 g of n propylperoxydicarbonate. After replacement with nitrogen, 48.6 g 25 mol. of vinylidene fluoride, 29.8 g 35 mol. of ethylene and 121.6 g 40 mol. of tetrafluoroethylene were further charged, and the mixture was subjected to polymerization under stirring at 30 C. When the pressure was lowered to 9 kg cm² 882 kPa , well degassed distilled water was charged into the system under nitrogen pressure so as not to lower the pressure below 10 kg cm² 980 kPa , and the polymerization was continued to obtain a terpolymer. Thus, a copolymer having a composition substantially the same as the charged composition was obtained at a yield of above 98 . The thus obtained copolymer was a resin excellent in heat resistance and having a melting point of 254 C and was readily formed into a sheet having a thickness of 150 microns micrometres by hot pressing. The pressed sheet had dielectric properties as shown below Thus, the terpolymer obtained was found to be a useful dielectric material having a large dielectric constant and a relatively small tan δ. The terpolymer sheet obtained in Example 1 was stretched in a ratio of 4 times at 100 C to obtain a film of 70 microns micrometres in thickness. Thus, the terpolymer was found to be rich in shapability and readily stretchable. The stretched film had a dielectric constant of 5.15 and a tan δ of 0.62 at 20 C and 1 KHz. The variation with temperature of dielectric constant and tan δ of the stretched film was measured at 30 Hz by a rheolograph mfd. by Toyo Seiki K.K. . The results of the measurement are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the terpolymer of the invention has a small temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and tan δ within a practical temperature range and is found to be a useful dielectric also from this view point. In a manner similar to that of Example 1, a terpolymer having mole ratios of vinylidene fluoride ethylene tetrafluoroethylene of 30 25 45 was produced. The thus obtained copolymer had a melting point of 258 C and showed the following dielectric properties when formed into a pressed film of 75 microns micrometres in thickness A terpolymer having the same composition as that of Example 3 was produced through suspension polymerization in a perhalogenated solvent of 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoroethane. After being fully washed and dried, the copolymer was formed into a pressed film of 75 microns micrometres in thickness, which showed the following dielectric properties The thus obtained film not only was fragile and poor in physical properties but also had a large tan δ. In a manner similar to that of Example 1, a terpolymer having mol. ratios of vinylidene fluoride ethylene tetrafluoroethylene of 45 10 45 was produced. The copolymer had a melting point of 271 C, a fluorine content of 67 mol. and apparently inferior shapability. The copolymer was formed into a sheet of 200 microns micrometres thickness, which showed the following dielectric properties Thus, it will be understood that a terpolymer having too small an ethylene content not only is poor in shapability but also fails to give the desired dielectric properties because of a large tan δ.
