# EVENT LOGGING SYSTEM

## Abstract
The invention provides a solid state eventlogging sys tem to record the occurrence of specified events in a remov able, solid state, memory cartridge 49 . Coun ters 17 55, 56, 57 continously count pulses produced by a plurality of electrical energy measur ing device A, B, C, D . Sample values of the continuous counts are produced and input to a microprocessor 23 wherein each sample value has the previous sample value subtracted therefrom. The difference is added to an interval sum stored in a random access memory 27 . The interval sums, together with real time information produced by a clock 47 , are input to the memory cartridge according to a predetermined format. The clock is maintained in synchronization with the frequency of the line voltage by the microprocessor.
