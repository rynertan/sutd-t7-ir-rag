# Double channel planar heterostructure semiconductor laser.

## Abstract
The semiconductor laser comprises a semiconductor substrate 1 of a first conductivity type, a multi layer double heterostructure 2 to 4 including successively at least a first cladding semiconductor layer 2 of the first conductivity type, an active semiconductor layer 3 , and a second cladding semiconductor layer 4 of a second conductivity type. The active semiconductor layer 3 has a narrower bandgap than those of the first and second cladding semiconductor layers 2 and 4, respectively . A stripe portion 30 with channels 40, 41 formed along both sides of the stripe 30 extends through the second cladding semiconduc tor layer 4 and the active semiconductor layer 3 to reach the first cladding layer 2 . A current blocking layer 5 to 7 formed on the multi layer double heterostructure except for the top surface of the stripe portion 30 includes a first blocking semiconductor layer 5 of the second conductivity type, a second blocking semiconductor layer 7 of the first conductivity type, and a third semiconductor layer 6 interposed between the first and second blocking semicon ductor layers 5 and 7, respectively and having a smaller carrier concentration than that of each of the first and second blocking semiconductor layers 5 and 7, respectively . A burying semiconductor layer 8 of the second conductivity type buries the top surface of the stripe portion 30 and the current blocking layer 5 to 7 . A pair of electrodes 20, 21 supplies a voltage to bias the semiconductor laser which is excellent in high frequency response characteristic, perform ance and reliability due to its improved current confinement structure.
