## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2 alkyl cyclopent 2 enones of formula wherein R represents one of the following groups C Cyclopentenones I are useful intermediates for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and of drugs for veterinary use, in particular prostaglandin. According to a known process for preparing cyclopentenones, an olefin is reacted, in a first step. with trihydrated manganese acetate, potassium permanganate, acetic anhydride and anhydrous sodium acetate, all in a large excess, with respect to the olefin, thereby obtaining a γ alkyl lactone, which, in a second step, is cyclized by means of polyphosphoric acid, thereby obtaining the final product. Such a process gives rise to low yields and requires particular reactants, which are expensive and may be handled only with difficulty furthermore the reactions lead to complex mixtures of products from which the γ alkyl lactone and the final product may be separated only with difficulty. In the disclosure La France et ses Parfums, 1958, no. 3, pages 39 53, there is described at page 51, paragraph 2 a process for the preparation of 2 alkyl 3 methyl cyclopent 2 enones by the following steps The invention aims to provide a process for the preparation of 2 alkyl cyclopent 2 enones of general formula I with reasonably good yields, which process starts from raw materials which are cheap and can be handled easily, and which process allows the intermediate products and the final product to be separated easily. The invention accordingly provides a process for the preparation of 2 alkyl cyclopent 2 enones of formula I , characterized by comprising the following steps In the starting olefin and consequently in the 2 alkyl cyclopent 2 enone I as well , n is preferably from 1 to 10, and R is preferably C The oxidization of olefin CH₂ CH CH₂ R II to epoxide III can be carried out by means of well known methods, according to which the substituents, optionally present in group R, remain unaltered. A suitable method resides in oxidizing the olefin by means of m chloroperbenzoic acid such method provides the epoxide with yields over 90 and allows a very simple working. Another suitable method resides in oxidising the olefin with H₂O₂ in the presence of a catalyst based on tungstate and phosphate ions such method is described for instance in an article of C. Venturello et al, in J. Org. Chem. The second step of the process according to the invention resides in alkylating the epoxide III by means of an alkylating agent Na CH COOR ₂ , where R is an ethyl, isopropyl or isobutyl radical the reaction is described for instance in the article of C. H. Depuy et al, in J. Org. Chem., 1964, page 2810, the reaction scheme being The epoxide is reacted with the above mentioned alkylating agent in the presence of a malonic ester of formula COOR CH₂ COOR . The alkylating agent should be used in a substantially equimolar ratio, with respect to the epoxide, and said malonic ester should be used in a molar ratio, with respect to the epoxide, of from 0.5 to 2, preferably about 1. The reaction has to be carried out under reflux conditions. The alkylation of epoxide III is found to be completely regioselective, providing only the attack product in the non substituted position. An intramolecular cyclization, yielding lactone IV , follows the alkylation. The reaction can be carried out suitably as follows metal sodium, in a finely subdivided form, is added to an anhydrous alcohol R OH. When the whole of the sodium is dissolved, the malonic ester COOR CH₂ COOR is added in such an amount as to obtain in solution both the alkylating agent and the non reacted malonic ester, according to the molar ratios defined hereinbefore. The alkylating agent Na CH COOR ₂ forms immediately. At this point the solution is brought under reflux conditions and the epoxide is added gradually the whole is made to react for a time of from 1 to 8 hours, depending on substituent R. α carboxy γ alkyl lactone IV is then saponified in an alkaline medium, thereby obtaining the corresponding acid VI . The reaction can be carried out as follows an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate is added to the reaction mixture of the preceding step and the two phases are mixed generally at from 50 C to the reflux temperature. Acid VI can be separated from the reaction mixture as follows alcohol R OH is distilled, while leaving the acid in the aqueous phase and separating said acid successively by crystallization or by extraction by means of an organic solvent. Acid VI is then decarboxylated, at 100 160 C, thereby obtaining a γ alkyl lactone of formula V . The decarboxylation is preferably carried out at 120 140 C. Some of the γ alkyl lactones can be used for perfumes or essential oils. The γ alkyl lactone V is then reacted at 20 100 C preferably 50 60 C , with a protic acid, thereby obtaining, by cyclization, a 2 alkyl cyclopent 2 enone of formula I . The protic acids are generally selected from polyphosphoric acid, 96 sulphuric acid weight volume , and a mixture consisting of CH₃ SO₃H and P₂O₅. The mixture of CH₃ SO₃H and P₂O₅ is found to be particularly suitable. In such mixture the CH₃ SO₃H P₂O₅ weight ratio is usually from 10 to 20 and is more preferably equal to about 10. The preparation of the mixture of CH₃ SO₃H and P₂O₅ is described for instance in an article of P. E. Eaton et al, in J. Org. Chem. The reaction can be carried out as follows γ alkyl lactone V is added to the protic acid, at room temperature. The resultant solution is heated as defined hereinbefore for a time generally from 5 to 24 hours, depending on the nature of substituent R. Then the solution is poured into water and the resultant solution is extracted by means of an organic solvent immiscible with water. The organic phase is separated, dehydrated and concentrated, in order to yield an oil. The product is then isolated by distillation under reduced pressure, by crystallization or by separation on a chromatographic column or by the combined use of two of these techniques. The main advantages of the process of the present invention may be summarized as follows The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples. 53.08 g 0.25 moles of ethyl 10 undecenoate were introduced into a 1000 cm³ flask, provided with a stirrer, reflux cooler, thermometer, and dropping funnel then 60.92 g 0.3 moles of meta chloroperbenzoic acid 85 concentration , dissolved in 650 cm³ of chloroform, were added dropwise over 2 hours. Once the addition was completed the mixture was kept under reflux conditions for 2 more hours and then the solution was cooled and shaken with a 10 by weight aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase was washed with water until neutrality, dehydrated on anhydrous sodium sulphate Na₂SO₄ and dried. The thus obtained oil was distilled under reduced pressure 108 110 C 2.10 ¹ mm Hg , thereby providing 52.5 g 0.23 moles of ethyl 10,11 epoxyundecanoate with a yield of 92 . 0.360 g 1.08.10 ³ moles of sodium tungstate Na₂WO₄.2H₂O dissolved in 6 cm³ of water, 0.55 cm³ 2.24.10 ³ moles of 40 phosphoric acid weight volume and 20.5 cm³ 2.11.10 ³ moles of 35 hydrogen peroxide weight volume were added, in that order, to a 250 cm³ flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux cooler and thermometer. The pH was brought to 1.6 by means of an aqueous solution of 30 sulphuric acid at 30 weight volume. At this point 53.08 g 2.5.10 ¹ moles of ethyl 10 undecenoate in 10 cc of 1,2 dichloroethane and 0.179 g 4.48.10 ⁴ moles of tricaprylmethylammonium chloride were added. The resultant two phase mixture was heated under strong stirring at 70 C for 4 hours, until the whole of the hydrogen peroxide was consumed, and then the mixture was treated with a saturated aqueous solution of Na₂SO₃ in order to eliminate possible traces of H₂O₂ and NaHCO₃. The organic phase was separated, dehydrated on anhydrous sodium sulphate, concentrated and distilled under reduced pressure. 100 cm³ of anhydrous ethyl alcohol and 1.01 g 4.38.10 ² moles of finely subdivided sodium were added, in that order, to a 500 cm³ flask, provided with a magnetic stirrer, reflux cooler, thermometer and dropping funnel. The mixture was kept at room temperature until the whole of the sodium was dissolved, and then 14.03 g 8.76.10 ² moles of diethylmalonate were added. The whole was kept under reflux conditions and 10.0 g 4.32.10 ² moles of ethyl 10,11 epoxyundecanoate were added, dropwise, over 1 hour. Once the addition was over, the mixture was kept under stirring for about 3 hours. Then 3.00 g of sodium carbonate in 100 cm³ of water were added and the alcohol was azeotropically distilled. The residual aqueous solution was acidified by means of an aqueous solution of 10 hydrochloric acid weight volume and cooled down. Overnight there was noted the precipitation of 12 g of a crystalline white solid, which was separated and decarboxylated in a nitrogen stream at 140 C, thereby providing 9.66 g 3.98.10 ² moles of 13 carboxy γ tridecalactone in the form of a pure white oil with a yield of 91 . 27 cm³ 36 g of distilled methanesulfonic acid and 4 g of phosphoric anhydride were added, in that order, to a 100 cm³ flask, provided with a magnetic stirrer and thermometer, pressurised with nitrogen. The whole was kept under stirring for 1 hour at room temperature until a limpid solution was obtained. Then 1.0 g 4.13.10 ³ moles of 13 carboxy γ tridecalactone were added, the temperature was raised to 60 C and the whole was made to react for 16 hours. Then the solution was dripped into 100 cm³ of water and the resultant mixture was kept under stirring for about 10 minutes. After many extractions with chloroform 4 x 30 cm³ , the organic phase was separated, washed with an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate until neutrality, dehydrated on anhydrous sodium sulphate and dried, thereby obtaining 0.97 g of a red oil. This oil was treated with diazomethane CH₂N₂ , in order to form the methyl ester of the desired product. The resultant oil was conveyed onto a silica gel column, using hexane ether as eluent in a 1 1 ratio by volume. Two fractions were recovered The yield of the latter was 41 . The molar ratio between the cyclohexenone and the cyclopentenone was 1 4.
