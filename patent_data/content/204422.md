# A uni directional flow, fluid valve assembly.

## Abstract
A substantially circular, valve assembly 10 comprises a pair of valving plates 12, 14 in which are formed separate, circular, and walled valving chambers 18. One plate is in surmounting relationship to the others, so that the valving chambers subsist in a plurality of tiers. All the chambers, however, are in given rows which are common to both tiers, and any one chamber, depending upon which tier it is in, either overlies or underlies a portion of another, adjacent chamber in the other tier. Consequently, a great through flow volume of fluid is accommodated in a considerably com pacted, overall valve assembly area. Notwithstanding such an integration of the valving chambers, no one chamber ob structs the fluid flow through any other thereof. Each of the chambers has its own inlet 20,22 and outlet 26,28 ports, a valving element 32 movable therewith, and a spring 46 for biasing the valving element in a given direction.
